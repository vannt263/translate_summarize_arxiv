    "the statistical study of the clustering properties of massive galaxies provides important information about their formation and evolution which represent major questions for cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "the correlation function of galaxies remains a simple yet powerful tool for implementing such statistical clustering studies .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a lot of interest has been concentrated specifically on measuring the clustering correlation function of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) @xcite ( see e.g * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "lrgs are predominantly red massive early - type galaxies , intrinsically luminous ( @xmath23 ) @xcite and thought to lie in the most massive dark matter haloes .",
    "they are also strongly biased objects @xcite and this coupled with their bright luminosity makes their clustering easy to detect out to high redshifts . for linear bias , the form of the lrg correlation function will trace that of the mass but even in this case the rate of correlation function evolution will depend on the bias model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which in turn depends on the galaxy formation process .    the passive evolution of the lrg lf and slow evolution of the lrg clustering @xcite seen in sdss , 2slaq and @xmath24 surveys already presents a challenge for hierarchical models of galaxy formation as predicted for a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe .",
    "since the lrg clustering evolution with redshift has been controversial , a major goal is to use the angular correlation function to test if the slow clustering evolution trend continues out to @xmath25 .",
    "the uniformity of the lrg spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with their 4000@xmath26 break , offer the ability to apply a colour - colour selection algorithm for our candidates .",
    "this technique has been successfully demonstrated primarily by @xcite in sdss in the analysis of lrg clustering at low redshift and then in 2slaq @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite lrg surveys at higher redshifts . for our study ,",
    "the available deep optical - ir @xmath27 imaging data from the sdss + ukidss las / dxs surveys in stripe 82 will be used .",
    "this combination of nir and deep optical imaging data , on a moderate sample size of area @xmath28 deg@xmath29 , results in a sample of @xmath30 lrg candidates at redshift @xmath25 .    the main tool for our clustering analysis will be the two - point angular correlation function , @xmath0 , which has been frequently used in the past , usually in cases where detailed redshift information was not known .",
    "hence , selecting stripe 82 lrgs based on colour - magnitude criteria , correspond to a rough photometric redshift ( photo - z ) estimation based on the 4000@xmath31 break shifting through the passbands .",
    "we shall apply the cross - correlation technique which was introduced by @xcite to measure the redshift distribution , @xmath32 , of our photometrically selected samples .",
    "one of the main advantages of @xmath0 is that it only needs the @xmath32 of the sample and then through limber s formula @xcite it can be related to the spatial two - point correlation function , @xmath33 .    in recent clustering studies",
    ", it was noted that the behaviour of @xmath33 , which has previously been successfully described by a single power - law of the form @xmath34 , significantly deviates from such a power - law at @xmath35 h@xmath8mpc .",
    "the break in the power - law , can be interpreted in the framework of a halo model , as arising from the transition between small scales ( 1-halo term ) to larger than a single halo scales ( 2-halo term ) .",
    "currently , our theoretical understanding of how galaxy clustering relates to the underlying dark matter is provided by the halo occupation distribution model ( hod , see , e.g @xcite ) via dark matter halo bias and halo mass function .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of hod can also give an insight into how certain galaxy populations evolve over cosmic time @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the sdss and ukidss data used in this paper , while in section 3 we describe the angular function correlation function estimators and their statistical uncertainties . in section 4",
    ", we estimate the redshift distribution through cross - correlations and then present the correlation results together with their power - law fits , @xmath15cdm model and a halo model in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to interpretation of the clustering evolution . in section 7 , we explore potential systematic errors that might affect the large scale clustering signal .",
    "we then argue that , if real , an observed large - scale clustering excess may be due to the scale - dependent bias caused by primordial non - gaussianity and compare our results to other previous works in section 8 . finally , in section 9 we summarize and conclude our findings .    throughout this paper ,",

    "while stripe 82 has only @xmath84deg height , our subfields with their @xmath85deg and @xmath86deg widths are a reasonable size for estimating the correlation function up to scales of @xmath87deg .",

    "field - to - field errors give similar results as jackknife errors , except at @xmath91 where the ftf errors underestimate the true error due to missing cross - field pairs .",
    "since the jackknife errors are better at a scale of order @xmath92 which are of prime interest here , these are the error estimators that will be used in this work unless otherwise stated .    when calculated in small survey areas , @xmath0 can be affected be an integral constraint , @xmath93 .",
    "normally @xmath0 has a positive signal at small scales and if the surveyed area is sufficiently small , this will cause a negative bias in @xmath0 at largest scales @xcite , i.e. @xmath94 . the integral constraint can be calculated from ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath95    where for the @xmath96 we assume the standard @xmath97 model in the linear regime (  [ sec : lcdm_model ] ) .",
    "no integral constraint is initially applied to our full sample results as the expected magnitude of @xmath93 is smaller than the @xmath0 amplitudes at scales analysed in this paper .",
    "this position will be reviewed when we move on to discuss models with excess power at large scales in  [ sec : tests ] .    to provide robust and accurate results from the correlation functions , we are also interested in model fitting to the observed @xmath0 ( see in  [ sec : plaw ] ,  [ sec : hod ] and  [ sec : lcdm_model ] ) .",
    "hence , for model fitting we will use the covariance matrix , which is calculated by : @xmath98 [ w(\\theta_{j})- \\overline{w(\\theta_{j } ) } ]   \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the @xmath99 is the correlation function measurement value excluding the @xmath100 subsample and the factor @xmath101 corrects from the fact that the realizations are not independent ( @xcite ) .",

    "the selection function of the random catalogue mimics only the angular selection of the real data .    for the first method",

    "a second random catalogue was created by dividing stripe 82 into six smaller subfields ( @xmath106 each ) and normalizing the density of random points to the density of galaxies within each subfield .",

    "even if the redshift of individual galaxies is not available , the 3-d clustering information can yet be recovered if the sample s redshift distribution , _",
    "n(z ) _ , is known .",
    "this can be achieved using limber s inversion equation @xcite which can project the spatial galaxy correlation function , @xmath33 , to the angular correlation function given the @xmath108 of the sample : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the galaxy redshift selection function . for our photometric selected lrg samples , only a very small fraction has a measured redshift , thus it is vital to estimate the @xmath108 of the stripe 82 lrg samples .",
    "one method for estimating the redshift distribution of the sample could be based on the various popular programs that derive photometric redshifts",
    "( photo - z s ) .",
    "photo - z estimates are based on the deep multi - band photometry coverage , and work by tracing some specific spectral features across the combination of filters which are then compared with different type of objects sed templates .",
    "indeed , our @xmath111 selection is a rough photo - z cut as we follow the movement of the @xmath112 break across the selected bands . in order to use the angular correlation function and the information that is encoded we need the @xmath108 of our sample ,",
    "hence we follow the technique of @xcite for reconstructing the lrg redshift distribution from cross - correlations .      [",
    "sec : nz ]    we employ newman s method , which is about determining the underlying redshift distribution of a sample of objects ( lrgs in our case ) through cross - correlation with a sample of known redshift distribution . by cross - correlating the sample ( or samples ) with known redshift and the sample under consideration , if both samples lie at the same distance , this will give a strong clustering signal .",
    "if the two samples that we are cross - correlating are separated and are at different @xmath51 distances , no cross - correlation signal will result .",
    "thus , through the cross - correlations we can infer our photometrically selected lrg sample @xmath113 ranges .",
    "following @xcite the probability distribution function of the redshift of the stripe 82 lrg samples , @xmath114 , is : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the integrated cross correlation function , @xmath117 , of the lrg photometric samples with the samples of known spectroscopic redshift ( see  [ ss : cross ] ) , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the gamma function , @xmath120 is the comoving angular distance and @xmath121 is the comoving distance at redshift z. the comoving distance @xmath122 corresponds to the maximum angle at given redshift , which must be large enough to avoid nonlinear biasing effects .    to derive @xmath114 via eq .",
    "[ eq : newmaneq ] we must estimate @xmath123 , since the angular size distance , @xmath124 and the comoving distance @xmath125 are given by the assumed cosmology .",
    "thus we now require only knowledge of the @xmath126 and @xmath127 parameters as function of redshift .",
    "fortunately under the assumption of linear biasing , the cross - correlation of the two samples under consideration is the result of the geometric mean of the autocorrelation functions of the samples , i.e. @xmath128 , hence we can use the information provided by autocorrelation measurements for each sample to break the degeneracy between correlation strength and redshift distribution .",
    "newman investigates the effect of systematics such as : different cosmologies , bias evolution , errors from the autocorrelation measurements and field - to - field zero points variations in the final redshift probability distribution result .",
    "these issues could be more important in the case of future photometric surveys aimed at placing constraints on the equation of dark energy .",
    "newman s angular cross - correlation technique requires the use of a data sample with known spectroscopic , or sufficiently accurate photometric , redshifts . for this reason we use a variety of samples with confirmed spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the cross - correlations with stripe 82 lrgs .",

    "this is clearly a source of uncertainty in fitting for @xmath154 .",

    "[ fig : fnl ] shows the effect of jointly fitting @xmath175 on the minimum halo mass , @xmath183 , in the hod model .",
    "the best fit model now gives @xmath186 and @xmath187 , lower than then the @xmath188 value when @xmath165 is assumed in the full hod fit .",
    "we should say that rather than detections of non - gaussianity , the present @xmath173 and stripe 82 lrg results should be more regarded as upper limits on non - gaussianity .",
    "large - scale angular correlation function results are still susceptible to large - scale gradients and even though there is no direct evidence for these in the @xmath173 or stripe 82 samples , there is still the possibility that these exist in the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the classic test for the reality of a correlation function feature is that it scales correctly with depth and at least the sdss and stripe 82 lrg correlation functions in figs .",
    "[ fig : lrg_fnl]a , b look like they do so",
    ". it will be interesting to see if as qso surveys @xcite and @xmath189 lbg surveys @xcite grow , whether the correlation functions at higher redshift also show an increased slope flattening as predicted for the non - gaussian models .",
    "the other uncertainty that has arisen is in the non - gaussian model itself where we have found that there is a rather strong dependence on a small - scale cut - off , @xmath190 .",
    "other authors have made some reference to this problem but only implicitly .",
    "it will be interesting to see if more accurate models for non - gaussianity can numerically predict this cut - off from first principles .",
    "we have measured @xmath0 for @xmath191 colour selected galaxies in stripe 82 exploiting sdss dr7 @xmath192 bands and ukidss las @xmath39 photometry . we used the cross - correlation technique of newman ( 2008 ) to establish that the average redshift of the lrgs is @xmath2 .",
    "this sample therefore probes higher redshifts than the previous sdss lrg samples of @xcite .",
    "we have established that a sample with sky density @xmath193deg@xmath194 has a comparable space density to the @xmath195 @xmath173 lrg sample of @xcite . however , this is only an approximate correspondence which makes evolutionary comparisons between the redshifts more tricky .",
    "what is clear is that the @xmath2 lrgs generally have a relatively high clustering amplitude .",
    "compared to the @xmath173 lrg @xmath0 scaled to the depth of the stripe 82 lrgs , the stripe 82 @xmath0 is higher at all scales , even those below @xmath196mpc .",
    "thus at intermediate scales , the @xmath2 lrgs are not only more clustered than predicted by the long - lived evolutionary model , they are also more clustered than the comoving model . at small separations ( @xmath197mpc ) the correlation function amplitude is again somewhat higher than the @xmath173 results scaled by the previously preferred stable clustering model .",
    "the stripe 82 @xmath0 also shows a very flat slope at large scales which means that the @xmath15cdm linear model has become a poorer fit than at lower redshift .    partly to look for an explanation for the flat large - scale slope , we then fitted a hod model to the stripe 82 @xmath0 .",
    "the best fit parameters were @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "the high amplitude of the correlation function clearly pushes the halo masses up and the space densities down .",
    "the lowest chi - square fits were found when large scales were excluded but the reduced chi - squares were still in the range 2.3 - 3.6 .",
    "this is actually an improvement over the lower redshift samples but this is certainly due to the larger errors on the stripe 82 data .",
    "we conclude that it is not possible to find an explanation for the flat slope in the stripe 82 @xmath0 on the basis of the hod model .",
    "we also then studied the evolution of the hod between @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "similar to @xcite , we concluded that a pure passive model with a low merger rate might produce too steep a @xmath0 slope at small scales ( @xmath206 ) . in this case",
    ", we have already noted that the small scale amplitude may also be too high for a passive model with stable clustering .",
    "we have looked for an explanation of the flat slope in terms of systematics by cross correlating the stripe 82 lrg sample with stellar density , airmass , seeing , sky background and galactic extinction and used the method of @xcite to correct our @xmath0 .",
    "even the combined correction for seeing , airmass and galactic extinction only produced a small change in @xmath0 at large scales .",
    "we conclude that the high amplitude and flat slope of the stripe 82 lrgs @xmath0 may have a significant contributions from the uncertainty in the comparison between @xmath173 and stripe 82 lrg luminosities .",
    "however , this leaves a similar contribution from a new and unknown source .",
    "we have discussed large - scale , primordial , non - gaussianity as one possibility for the source of this large - scale excess . we have suggested that the evidence from the @xmath173 sample itself for an excess at even larger scales may fit in with the behaviour expected from non - gaussianity over this redshift range . in this case",
    "we returned to the fitting of halo masses including the non - gaussian component and found that the best fit @xmath183 decreased from @xmath207m@xmath208 to @xmath209m@xmath208 .",
    "more importantly , if the stripe 82 large - scale @xmath0 excess proves reliable and not due to systematics , then we have made a significant detection of non - gaussianity in the @xmath2 lrg distribution with an estimated local non - gaussianity parameter estimate of @xmath210 .",
