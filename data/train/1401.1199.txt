    "thermoelectric ( te ) materials with potential applications within power generation and refrigeration have represented a thrust area of research for the past few decades . te materials",
    "can convert waste heat into electric power and hence play a vital role in meeting the present condition of energy crisis and environment pollution.@xcite the performance of a te material is reflected in the dimensionless figure of merit , @xmath5 , given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the thermopower , the electrical conductivity , the thermal conductivity , and the absolute temperature , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 includes both the electronic , @xmath11 , and the lattice contributions , @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 . from this expression , it is evident that finding materials with high @xmath5 is a challenge , as it appears that such a material should satisfy the conflicting requirements of high thermopower , which is often found for doped insulators , and behave as a good electrical conductor like a metal with a low thermal conductivity .",
    "good electrical conductivity and poor thermal conductivity implies a weak electron scattering and strong phonon scattering .",
    "remarkable progress has been made in recent years exploring different classes of materials for better te performance.@xcite few materials with @xmath14 are known.@xcite apart from the material properties necessary for a good figure of merit , there are also other materials properties to be considered",
    ". the materials should possess a high melting point as far as @xmath15waste heat recovery@xmath15 is concerned , and they should be structurally stable in the operating temperature range .",
    "in addition , the constituents of the materials should be abundant and in - expensive .",
    "the real success in the field of thermoelectrics lies in identifying a material with all the desired properties .",
    "there are few commonly used good te materials such as pbte and bi@xmath0te@xmath16.@xcite bi@xmath0te@xmath16 can be hole doped and electron doped and has @xmath17 at room temperature , but still it has a shortfall as te is a rare element and has many restrictions for large - scale applications.@xcite recently , alternative pb - free materials such as aggate@xmath0 and cubis@xmath0 , have been considered.@xcite the present work on the chalcopyrite semiconductor cugate@xmath0 is motivated by the recent experimental work @xcite reporting a @xmath5 of 1.4 at temperatures above 800 k for this compound .",
    "although many of the pbte based materials may also have @xmath18 , their range of operating temperature is much lower than that of cugate@xmath0.@xcite ab - inito calculations for the similar chalcopyrite compound aggate@xmath0 were performed by parker and singh@xcite and wu et al.,@xcite who showed that hole doping of aggate@xmath0 improves its te performance .",
    "the present work is a theoretical analysis of cugate@xmath0 , which supports the classification of this compound as an excellent thermoelectric material .",
    "in addition , also cusbs@xmath0 is examined .",
    "this compound is isostructural with cubis@xmath0 , which has been predicted to be an excellent te material.@xcite the paper is organized as follows :",
    "section ii describes the method used for the calculations , and section iii presents the results and a discussion .",
    "conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "the electronic band structures were calculated by means of the full - potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method based on first - principles density functional theory as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite since calculations using standard local - density ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) schemes for the exchange - correlation potential underestimate the band gaps of semiconductors , we have used the modified gga known as the tran - blaha modified becke - johnson@xcite potential ( tb - mbj).@xcite for k - space integrations a 20x20x20 k - mesh was used for cugate@xmath0 and 19x31x8 k - mesh for cusbs@xmath0 in the monkhorst - pack scheme , resulting in 641 and 800 k - points in the irreducible parts of the brillouin zones for the two compounds , respectively .",
    "the self - consistent calculations included spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the crystal structure of cugate@xmath0 is tetragonal with space group @xmath19 ( no .",
    "122 ) and lattice parameters a=6.028   and c=11.949 .@xcite for cusbs@xmath0 , the crystal structure is in the orthorhombic space group @xmath20 ( no .",
    "62 ) with lattice parameters a=6.018  , b=3.7958    and c=14.495 .@xcite all the calculations were performed with the experimental lattice parameters with an energy convergence criterion of @xmath21 ry per formula unit . the carrier concentration ( p for holes and n for electrons ) and temperature ( @xmath10 ) dependent thermoelectric properties like thermopower ( @xmath7 ) , electrical conductivity ( @xmath8 ) , power factor ( @xmath22@xmath8 ) , and figure of merit ( @xmath5 ) were calculated using the boltztrap@xcite code , within the rigid band approximation ( rba)@xcite and the constant scattering time ( @xmath23 ) approximation ( csta ) . in the rba",
    "the band structure is assumed unaffected by doping , which only leads to a shift of the chemical potential .",
    "for semiconductors it is a good approximation for calculation of the transport properties , when the doping level is not too high.@xcite in the csta , the scattering time of electrons is assumed independent of the electron energy , while it may depend on carrier concentration and temperature . a detailed discussion of the csta is given in refs .",
    ", and , and references therein .",
    "the only situation where the csta can fail is when bipolar conduction is significant , which happens in narrow - gap materials .",
    "according to sofo and mahan,@xcite the best performance of a thermoelectric material is found when the energy gap is about 10 k@xmath24t@xmath25 , where t@xmath25 is the operating temperature , as far as direct band gap materials are concerned . in the case of cugate@xmath0 , which is found to have a direct band gap of about 1.2 ev",
    ", this corresponds to t@xmath25 @xmath261400 k. according to the present calculations @xmath5 reaches its maximum value near 950 k , and this justifies the approximation used in the calculations for cugate@xmath0 , as we are still far away from the region of bipolar conduction . in the case of cusbs@xmath0 , the band gap around 1 ev corresponds to t@xmath25 @xmath27 1200 k , however the melting point is@xcite only 825 k. therefore , the present calculations for cusbs@xmath0 cover only temperatures up to 700 k , again a safe regime as far as the csta is concerned .",
    "the calculated band structure of cugate@xmath0 along the high symmetry directions of the tetragonal brillouin zone is shown in fig .",
    "the valence band maximum ( vbm ) ( zero energy in the band structure plot ) and the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) are both located at the centre of the brillouin zone i.e. at the @xmath28-point , making the compound a direct - band - gap semiconductor .",
    "the band gap values obtained within the gga and the tb - mbj are given in table i. from the large band gaps it is expected that there should not be any bipolar conduction . the band structure in the vicinity of the vbm exhibits a mixture of heavy and light bands , which is often favourable for thermoelectric performance , one can also see here such a situation in the vicinity of the vbm .",
    "the heavy band found just below the vbm arises from the cu - d and te - p states , and below this lies the light band of te - p and ga - d character .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) of cugate@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where it is apparent that the major contribution to the bands at the vbm comes from the cu - d states , leading to a strong increase in the dos as energy is moving away from the vbm . similarly",
    ", the dos also rises steeply above the cbm , albeit not as distinctly as around the vbm , cf . fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "the heavy bands usually contribute to a high thermopower while the lighter bands offer an advantage of high mobility , a favorable combination often leading to an excellent te performance of the material .",
    "although one might also expect that n - doping could give good thermoelectric performance for cugate@xmath0 , the presence of multiple heavy bands at the vbm would likely favour the p - type doping over n - type , as is indeed found in the succeeding subsection , where the transport properties and optimized doping level are discussed .    for cusbs@xmath0 the calculated band structure along the high symmetry directions of the orthorhombic brillouin zone is shown in fig .",
    "this compound is an indirect - band - gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.05 ev , where experimental gap values are somewhat higher , 1.38 ev@xcite and 1.52 ev@xcite ( see table i ) .",
    "the gap is large enough to prevent bipolar conduction for operating temperatures below the melting point .",
    "the bands near the @xmath28-point are dispersive in all three symmetry directions , albeit least dispersive along @xmath28-z .",
    "the dos of cusbs@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , from which it is seen that the major contribution to the dos near the vbm comes from the cu - d states . compared to the dos of cugate@xmath0 , there is less symmetry between the cbm and vbm regimes , which would render p - type doping more favorable over n - type doping in cusbs@xmath0 than in cugate@xmath0 .",
    "the presence of the heavy mass band at the vbm for both compounds indicates the possibility for excellent thermo - electric performance .",
    "this is discussed in the following section .",
    "the carrier concentration and temperature dependent thermoelectric properties of cugate@xmath0 are obtained by solving the boltzmann transport equation as implemented in the bolztrap@xcite code .",
    "the calculated properties are the thermopower , the electrical conductivity divided by the scattering time ( i.e. @xmath29/@xmath30 ) , the power factor , and the figure of merit as functions of carrier concentration and temperature .",
    "since most of the experiments are done in poly - crystalline samples , we have calculated the averages of the thermopower and the electrical conductivity ( respectively ) over three orthogonal axes in order to estimate the figure of merit . due to",
    "the lack of experimental data for cusbs@xmath0 from which the relaxation time may be extracted ( temperature dependent concentration and resistivity ) , we have for this compound only studied the concentration and temperature dependent thermopower , and concentration dependent @xmath29/@xmath30 ratio .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath7 depends on carrier concentration and temperature , but it is independent of @xmath23 due to the csta .",
    "the calculated thermopower for cugate@xmath0 , @xmath31 , as a function of hole concentration @xmath32 at different temperatures along the a- and c - axes is shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "the trend of the thermopower along the two axes is similar to what has been found for other thermoelectric materials with the tetragonal structure.@xcite it is also seen that the thermopower increases with decreasing carrier concentration .",
    "the pisarenko behavior , i.e. logarithmic variation of the thermopower with carrier concentration , is found in the range of @xmath33@xmath34 @xmath3 , which is an optimum working region for good thermoelectric materials .",
    "the variation of the thermopower of cugate@xmath0 as a function of temperature was measured by plirdpring _ et al._@xcite these authors also determined the temperature dependent carrier density @xmath35 , so by combining this information with the calculated @xmath31 , the calculated temperature dependent thermopower @xmath36 may be obtained and compared directly to experiment .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "4 . the theory and experiment are in good agreement with a qualitatively similar shape and a maximum thermopower around 400 k ( maximal thermopower of 450 @xmath37v / k and 410 @xmath37v / k in theory and experiment , respectively ) . at 900",
    "k the thermopower has fallen to around 250 @xmath37v / k . at 950 k , where the measured figure of merit has its maximum value ( about @xmath38 ) , an experimental thermopower of @xmath39v / k is measured,@xcite as compared to the theoretical value of @xmath40v / k .",
    "it is interesting to examine the thermopower also in the case of electron doping , which is illustrated in fig . 5 , showing the thermopower variation with electron concentration at different temperatures and along both the a and c axes .",
    "the magnitude of the thermopower is about the same for given carrier density for p- and n - type doping , about 400 @xmath37v / k at @xmath41 @xmath3 and 900 k , however the anisotropy is larger in the case of n - type doping . from fig .",
    "5 the difference in the thermopower along @xmath42 and @xmath43 is @xmath27 65 @xmath37 v / k ( larger along @xmath42 ) , which is about twice as large as in p - type doped cugate@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . this might be unfavorable for the potential use of n - type doped cugate@xmath0 as a thermoelectric material.@xcite the variation of the thermopower with temperature for cusbs@xmath0 at selected hole concentrations is displayed in fig .",
    ". the thermopower increases with decreasing carrier concentration as in all good te materials .",
    "the melting point of cusbs@xmath0 is relatively low , @xmath44 k,@xcite and hence this compound is less suited for high temperature applications , however it may find application as a cooling component , similar to the isostructural cubis@xmath0 compound.@xcite to investigate the anisotropy of thermoelectric properties we have calculated the directional dependent thermopower as function of the hole and electron concentration as shown in fig .",
    "6(b , c ) . from the figure",
    ", it appears that the thermopower is very similar in the the @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions , while it is higher in the @xmath47 direction by about 70 @xmath37v / k for hole doping and numerically lower by 100 @xmath37v / k for electron doping .",
    "thus , the thermopower for hole doping is somewhat larger than for electron doping , assuming similar carrier densities .",
    "the magnitude of the thermopower for hole doping is similar to what is found for the isostructural cubis@xmath0,@xcite while the anisotropy is somewhat larger .",
    "the electrical conductivity may be estimated for cugate@xmath0 by a combination of theory and experiment .",
    "this requires that , the scattering time @xmath23 is estimated , which is possible from the experiments of ref . , if the scattering time is assumed to be a function of temperature alone , i.e. @xmath48 . the calculated ratio @xmath49 is a function of @xmath10 and carrier concentration @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath50 . in the experiments",
    "the carrier concentration itself is a function of temperature and displayed in fig . 3 of ref . .",
    "the experimental data are available up to 800 k , and we have extrapolated in order to get the concentration up to 950 k. the scattering time then follows from the relation @xmath51 here , @xmath52 and @xmath35 are the measured conductivity and carrier concentration , respectively , while @xmath49 is the calculated ratio .",
    "subsequently , we may obtain @xmath8 as a function of two variables by multiplying the calculated ratio by @xmath53 : @xmath54 the scattering time obtained in this way is displayed in figure 7 .",
    "a similar procedure was adopted by ref .",
    ", however using only one @xmath35 value and assuming phonon - dominated scattering . fig .",
    "8 shows the obtained electrical conductivity ( @xmath8 ) along the a- and c- directions as functions of hole concentration .",
    "the electrical conductivity increases in both cases essentially linearly with the carrier concentration , as also found in drude s model .",
    "the conductivity is significantly higher along the @xmath42-axis than along the @xmath43-axis , approximately by a factor of 5 .",
    "the electrical conductivity is a decreasing function of temperature for given carrier density , mainly reflecting the temperature dependence of the scattering time .    having the thermopower and the electrical conductivity , the power factor ( s@xmath55@xmath8 )",
    "is calculated and displayed in fig .",
    "9 as function of carrier concentration for three representative temperatures . at 950 k , the calculated power factor at the experimentally realized carrier concentration of @xmath56 @xmath3 ( present authors extrapolation of data from ref . )",
    "is @xmath57 mw / m k@xmath55 , which is in fair agreement with the corresponding measured value@xcite of 1.35 mw / m k@xmath55 .    in the case of cusbs@xmath0",
    "the calculated variation of the @xmath29/@xmath30 ratio with hole and electron concentration at 300 k is shown in fig .",
    "10(a , b ) .",
    "the @xmath29/@xmath30 varies almost isotropically with a little difference seen along the b - axis , which is similar to the trend observed in the thermopower , fig .",
    "6(b , c ) .",
    "the @xmath29/@xmath30 ratio is higher for hole doping than for electron doping , so for similar carrier density and similar scattering times , this implies better te performance for p - type cusbs@xmath0 . as there are no experimental data available for this compound , we were not able to proceed to find the electrical conductivity as in the case of cugate@xmath0 .      to calculate the figure of merit @xmath5 the thermal conductivity @xmath9 must be known .",
    "this was taken from the experiment.@xcite @xmath9 is the sum of the electronic and the lattice thermal conductivities , @xmath13 , and these authors showed that if the electronic thermal conductivity is obtained from the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) relation @xmath58 , using the lorentz number ( @xmath59 w @xmath60 / k@xmath55 ) , the lattice contribution is well described with an inverse @xmath10 law , i.e. @xmath61 , in the range 400 - 800 k , as applicable to umklapp scattering .",
    "the wf relation is valid for metals , whereas more accurate modeling may be needed in some cases for semiconductors , see ref .",
    "and references therein . at temperatures above 800 k",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity seems to fall more steeply than dictated by the umklapp law.@xcite following ong et al.@xcite ( for the case of n - type zno ) we have found that the experimental lattice conductivity is well approximated in the full range 400 - 950 k by a fit of the form @xmath62 , with @xmath63 w / m and @xmath64 w / m k. this is illustrated in fig .",
    "11 , which also shows the above wf and umklapp contributions . from the experimental information regarding the thermal conductivity",
    ", we may calculate the figure of merit as function of carrier concentration and temperature as illustrated in fig . 12 .",
    "12(a ) shows for three temperatures the carrier dependence of the figure of merit , which is rising above @xmath65 for carrier densities above @xmath66 @xmath3 .",
    "such high carrier densities are not encountered in experiment , so for a better comparison with experiment the @xmath5 factor evaluated for the experimental carrier density ( ref . )",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "12(b ) . here",
    "the theoretical figure of merit reaches a value of @xmath67 at @xmath68 k , in perfect agreement with the experimental value of @xmath38 at this temperature.@xcite the experimental carrier density at @xmath68 k is only @xmath69 @xmath3 , as extrapolated from fig . 3 of ref .",
    ", i. e. , significantly lower than the optimum density indicated from fig .",
    "this high figure of merit indeed renders cugate@xmath0 a promising material for high temperature thermoelectric applications .",
    "furthermore , under the same conditions , the seebeck coefficient is calculated to be 287 @xmath37v / k in good agreement with the measured value of 244 @xmath37v / k.@xcite",
    "electronic transport properties of cugate@xmath0 and cusbs@xmath0 were calculated using density functional theory .",
    "both compounds were found to be very good thermoelectric materials with p - type doping .",
    "a somewhat anisotropic character of the thermopower and electrical conductivity as functions of hole concentration was found in both compounds . in the case of hole",
    "doped cugate@xmath0 with a concentration of @xmath69 @xmath3 , we obtained a figure of merit @xmath70 and a thermopower of 287 @xmath37v / k at 950 k , in excellent agreement with the reported experimental value . in the case of cusbs@xmath0",
    "the seebeck coefficient was found to be large , e.g. at room temperature the calculated thermopower exceeds 400 @xmath37v / k for a hole concentration of @xmath71 @xmath3 .",
    "the melting point of this compound is low , and high - temperature thermoelectric applications will be impractical , but this material might be suitable for low temperature applications .",
