    "we have found an aligned array of crystallites in gels prepared under a magnetic field of 5 t , which was used as media of the crystal growth of pbbr@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the crystallites were aligned with their crystallographic axis along the direction of the magnetic field , which was applied during the preparation of the gels .",
    "the magnetic field did not affect considerably if it was applied during the growth of pbbr@xmath0 .",
    "it is , thus , anticipated that the magnetic field applied during the preparation of the pb - doped silica hydorgels made the gel structure anisotropic .",
    "the first purpose is the identification of the anisotropy in the gel network .    beside optimization of the condition of the crystal growth in silica gels such as @xcite ,",
    "the control of the structure of silica gels is a subject of recent studies .",
    "the control of the structure has been achieved by the selection of starting materials , ph control of the solvent , solvent exchange during polymerization stage , and aging @xcite .",
    "there are a lot of potential uses of the silica gels with controlled structure .",
    "the transport of materials in the gels depends on the struscure in the gels .",
    "thus , for example , the crystal growth in hydorgels can be controlled by the controlled structure in the hydrogels .",
    "if aerogels are made by drying the controlled silica hydrogels , they keep the structure in solution and then can be applied to a new type of column chromatography . if pore size is highly controlled uniformly , the filtering of the cuumn must be improved .",
    "if we realize anisotropy in mechanical and/or thermomechanical properties due to the anisotropic structure of hydrogels , those properties can be applied as a smart meterials for the sensing devices , actuators , mems , and so on .    here , we focus on the structural anisotropy in silica hydrogels and structure .",
    "effect of magnetic field applied during the gelation on the network structure of polymer gels has been elucidated .",
    "aligned gel networks have been formed for both chemical and physical gels .",
    "chemically cross - linked poly(n - isopropylacrylamid ) forms aligned network structure perpendicular to magnetic field @xcite . physically cross - linked agarose gels also show the perpendicular alignment @xcite . in case side - chain group",
    "prefers the parallel alignment , polymer chain align perpendicularly to the magnetic field because the side - chain group is basically normal to the main chain .",
    "one of such groups contains a conjugate @xmath2 electron .",
    "a typical example is a benzene ring , in which ring current is induced . on the other hand , in case a group has magnetic moment , the part including such a group preferes orient in parallel to the magnetic field @xcite .    in the case of silica gels ,",
    "the interaction of polymer chain with magnetic field is not elucidated well . in this paper , after presenting the results of birefringence measurement and scanning microscopic light scattering , the discussions on the mechanism of interaction with the magnetic field are given .",
    "10 cm        the samples were prepared in the same way as described in @xcite , except for the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "sodium metasilicate was dissolved in distilled water by starting for two hours .",
    "after that , acetic acid and aqueous solution of pb(no@xmath3)@xmath0 were added and then stirred for two hours .",
    "this solution was settled for 7 days under various magnetic fields ( 0 , 1 , 3 , and 5 t ) parallel to the sample tube at a 298k .",
    "the vessels used are cylindrical tube with inner being 7.8 mm .",
    "the magnetic field was applied parallel to the cylindrical axis . on the birefringence measurement",

    "[ fig : sample ] ; that is , we estimated the sample thickness for this measurement to be @xmath4=7.71@xmath50.09 mm .",
    "7.5 cm        snarmont method was employed for the birefringence measurement .",
    "we utilized together a spectrometer to evaluate the intensity of the light transmitted the analyzer as a function of the rotation angle of the analyzer .",
    "usual snarmont method the rotation angle of the analyzer , which is a polarizer located after quarter wave plate ( snarmont compensator ) , where the transmitted light disappears is evaluated by eye . if no sample , the transmitted light vanishes for the configuration of the crossed polarizers .",
    "if a birefringent sample is inserted with the axis pointing the 45@xmath6 with respect to the transmitting axis of the polarizer , the rotation angle of the analyzer at which the transmitted light disappears changes . instead of detection by eye",
    ", we fit the intensity as a function of the rotation angle , @xmath7 , of the analyzer by @xmath8 to determine the retardation @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath4 being the optical path difference and the thickness of the sample .",
    "photons were counted per 100 ms for a few minutes to obtain the intensities @xmath11 ( averaged ) and the standard deviations were also calculated .",
    "the measure of birefringence , @xmath12 , is obtained from @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wavelength of light source , commonly the mercury light , whose @xmath14 being 546 nm .",
    "note that @xmath12 here is defined as @xmath15 with the optic axis being parallel ( @xmath16 ) to the direction of the magnetic field .",

    "the magnetic field applied was 5 t and the fitting results are @xmath17 .",
    "therefrom , @xmath12 is estimated as @xmath18 .",
    "scanning microscopic light scattering ( smils ) was carried out to scan and measure many different positions in the samples , in order to rigorously determine a time- and space - averaged , i.e. , ensemble - averaged , ( auto- ) correlation function of the concentration fluctuating in the sample .",
    "all the samples were filtered through 0.1 @xmath19 m filters to avoid interference from dust particles .",
    "an semiconductor laser with 532 nm wavelength were used in different solutions as the incident beam .",
    "measurements were made at four different angles , which were 40 , 60 , 90 , and 125@xmath6 , and the typical measurement time was 90 s. the samples were maintained at a constant temperature of 30@xmath6c throughout the experiments .",
    "scanning measurement was performed at 31 points for each sample to determine the dynamic component of the ensemble - averaged dynamic structure factor @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the determined correlation function was transformed to the distribution function of relaxation time , @xmath21 , numerically transformed to relaxation - time distribution composed of one or two logarithmic gaussian distribution ( lgd ) @xcite . in the present study",

    "the samples has been classified in two classes at @xmath22=5 t ; one has exhibited no birefringence while a negative @xmath12 with the order of the magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "it is anticipated that there exists a coexistence region where two stable states , one of which is most stable and the other a metastable ( dotted curves in the inset of fig .",

    "we saw a tendency that the distribution of @xmath23 for birefringent samples is narrower that for non - birefringent ones .",
    "we conjecture that the distribution of the pore size measured by smils directly reflects .",
    "the optimization of the condition of measurement was difficult ; the optimal combination of the laser power and the parameter of photo multiplier was different for the scattering angles depending of the samples .",
    "we wish to postpone that precise determination of the pore size .      here , we discuss the origin of the negative birefringence of the pb - doped silica gels prepared under a magnetic field .",
    "aforementioned we have interested in the structure of scale around several tens or a few hundreds nm .",
    "pores of this scale has been reported , thought the samples have been aerogels @xcite .",

    "let us remain the existence of the dopants of pb@xmath24 and that the skeletons made of silicon and oxygen atoms is of full of dangling bonds .",
    "we speculate the ring current along close loops through the mechanism similar to that of electric conduction of the conjugated polymers @xcite and the force tending to direct those rings normal to the magnetic field .",
    "one can readily understand the negative birefringence from this structural anisotropy .",
    "other possibilities can not be , of course , ruled out .",

    "the distribution of the characteristic length become unimodal . on the other hand ,",
    "if the closed loops orients directly with respect to that plane , the distribution must be broadened .     a typical result of smils .",
