    "to understand the general principles in architectures of networks , many deterministic models are introduced into complex networks  @xcite .",
    "these models are useful tools for investigating analytically not only topological features of networks in detail  @xcite , but also dynamical problems on the networks  @xcite . before presenting our own findings ,",
    "it is worth reviewing some of this preceding work to understand its achievements and shortcomings .",
    "deterministic scale - free networks were firstly proposed by barabsi _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite and intensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate a scale - free topology .",
    "however , to some extent , the small exponent @xmath0 of the degree distribution for the model did nt satisfy the real statistic results well . instead , dorogovtsev  _ et al . _",
    "introduced another elegant model , called pseudofractal scale - free web ( psw )  @xcite which is extended by comellas _",
    "consequently  @xcite . based on a similar idea of psw , jung _ et al .",
    "_ presented a class of recursive trees  @xcite , which have the small - world behavior built in .",
    "additionally , in order to discuss modularity , ravasz _ et al . _ proposed a hierarchical network model  @xcite , the exact scaling properties and extensive study of which were reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , motivated by the problem of apollonian space - filing packing , apollonian networks  @xcite with a typical loop structure were introduced and intensively investigated @xcite .",
    "these pioneering works are all invaluable tools for the topology of networks studies .    in the last few years , it is found that many real networks are inhomogeneous , consisting of distinct nodes and links .",
    "for instance , the scientist collaboration network , where scientists are identified with nodes , and an edge exists between two scientists if they have coauthored at least one paper  @xcite , and the internet at the as level , where the link weights represent the bandwidth of a cable and node weight the load of a router  @xcite , among other areas .",
    "recently , weight dynamics ideas have been applied with success to topics as diverse , such as random walks  @xcite , condensation  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite , traffic congestion  @xcite , epidemic spreading  @xcite , information filtering  @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "the findings above might provide insight for understanding the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure and dynamics behaviors of the weighted networks .",
    "most previous weighted random models  @xcite with topology and weight coevolution , however , possess very loose clustering structures when the size of the networks is large . at the same time , previous deterministic models , are mainly unweighted  @xcite , which ignore the heterogeneity of edges in real networks .",
    "what s more , the models  @xcite on psw networks fail to provide the reason for adopting the recursive way to build up the networks .",
    "consequently , in this paper , we introduce a model bringing weight evolution into the growth of pseudofractal scale - free web ( psw )  @xcite that aims to circumvent these incongruities properly . as we will show , in the case of the recursive construction , the traffic and its fluctuation decrease exponentially with time either on edges or at nodes .",
    "hence , we believe the construction method may shed some light on networks design to improve the control and speed of the whole network  @xcite . at the same time , our comprehensive and rigorous solutions may help people understand better the interplay between network topology and weight dynamics .",
    "the construction of the model is controlled by two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , evolving in a recursive way .",
    "we denote the network after @xmath3 steps by @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ net01 ] ) .",
    "then the network at step @xmath3 is constructed as follows . for @xmath6",
    ", @xmath7 is a triangle consisting of three links with unit weight . for @xmath8 , @xmath4",
    "is obtained from @xmath9 .",
    "we add @xmath10 ( @xmath1 is positive integer ) new nodes for each of the links with weight @xmath11 , and we connect each new node to both ends of this link by new links of unit weight ; moreover , we increase the weight of these links by @xmath12 ( @xmath2 is positive integer ) .    before introducing our model further ,",
    "we explain why adopting such a recursive way and why the generated network is increasingly efficient for transmitting information with network order . in this model , the recursive construction is motivated by the practical need to improve the transport capacity of real networks .",
    "as is known to us , both the physical networks and the numbers of users are growing continuously .",
    "the performance of the networks for larger system sizes and heavier loads are critical issues to be addressed in order to guarantee networks functioning in he near future .",
    "for example , if the traffic fluctuates dramatically , a highway is more likely to be congested frequently when the peak value of traffic exceeding its capacity .",
    "there is thus a need to build up more branches to distribute the heavy traffic .",
    "however ,  how many branches must we have ? \" and  where shall we put them ? \"",
    "are open questions yet .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claimed the fluctuations in traffic flow constitute the main factor affecting the performance of networks .",
    "they derived the dependence of fluctuations with the mean traffic on unweighted networks analytically .",
    "consequently , their recipes were adopted extensively to the weighted networks by the authors of ref  @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref  @xcite , for correlated networks ( assortative or disassortative mixing  @xcite ) , the average traffic through a link @xmath13 during a time window can be represented as @xmath14 and the standard deviation can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is its link weight  @xcite .",
    "the length of the time window for observation is @xmath17 .",
    "the average number of cars or walkers among various time windows in the network is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is defined as a random variable representing the number of walkers travelling through the link in the time window .    with respect to the traffic at nodes ,",
    "the average traffic at a node @xmath20 @xmath21 then the standard deviation as a function of @xmath22 can be obtained as : @xmath23 at each time step , the traffic will be distributed dispersedly to the newly built edges ( nodes ) .",
    "the larger , the size of the considered network is , the lower the fluctuations on each edge ( at each node ) should be .",

    "firstly , we give out the analytical solution of distribution of strength , degree and weight to test its scale - free nature ; simultaneously , we show the analytical expression of average traffic and its deviation of nodes and edges ; subsequently , we move forward to the average clustering coefficient coupled with the diameter of this network for the sake of verifing its small - world property ; finally , we study the degree correlations as well .",
