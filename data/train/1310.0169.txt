    "giant resonances of nuclei are a clear manifestation of the strong collective excitation modes in many - body quantum systems .",
    "detailed experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to find out all possible giant resonances with various multipole transitions @xcite .",
    "inelastic @xmath1 scattering has been used as the most suitable tool to extract isoscalar multipole strengths . since @xmath1 particle has @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the first excited state is as high as 20.2 mev , only isoscalar natural parity transitions are strongly excited , ( an exception is the weak coulomb excitation of the isovector giant dipole resonance , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) . at extremely forward scattering - angles including 0@xmath9 ,",
    "cross sections for states with small transferred angular momenta ( @xmath10 ) are strongly enhanced .",
    "in addition , @xmath11 angular distributions at high bombarding energies are characterized by clear diffraction patterns .",
    "these characteristic features allow us to reliably determine the multipole transition strengths .",
    "in fact , by means of the multipole decomposition analysis ( mda ) , many isoscalar giant resonances have been successfully determined , and their excitation strengths have been extracted in recent years by the rcnp and the texas a & m groups  @xcite .    the giant resonances in @xmath12 mg , @xmath4si and @xmath13ca have been already studied by both groups . among these light nuclei , of special interest",
    "are the giant resonances in @xmath0s with proton and neutron numbers of 16 .",
    "various theoretical models such as mean - field approaches , the shell model , and cluster - structure and molecular - resonance points of view , have predicted that there must exist well - developed superdeformed ( sd ) bands at high excitation energies in @xmath0s .",
    "this interesting prediction is made on basis of the concept that when the @xmath0s nucleus attains a superdeformed shape , with the ratio 2:1 for the long and short axes , nucleon number 16 becomes a magic number and the advent of a stable sd band is expected at high excitation energies  @xcite . also , @xmath0s is a key nucleus to understand the relation between the sd structure in heavy nuclei and the cluster structure in light nuclei .",
    "the sd bands in many light nuclei , such as @xmath14ar , @xmath13ca , and @xmath15ni @xcite have been discovered in the last decade .",
    "therefore , many experiments have been performed  @xcite in order to search for the sd band in @xmath0s . however , no clear evidence for the sd band in @xmath0s has so far been reported .    in the present work ,",
    "we report the results on the @xmath0s(@xmath1,@xmath16 ) experiment at @xmath17 = 386 mev .",
    "we find candidate states that might constitute the sd and @xmath4si + @xmath1 cluster bands in @xmath0s .",
    "the experiment was performed at the ring cyclotron facility of research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) , osaka university .",
    "the details of the experimental setup and procedure are described in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we present the brief outline of the experiment and procedures specific to the present measurement .",
    "inelastic scattering of 386 mev @xmath1 particles from @xmath0s has been measured at forward angles ( @xmath18 = 0@xmath9 @xmath19 10.5@xmath9 ) . in order to identify low - j@xmath3 values of complicated overlapping states , background - free measurements in inelastic @xmath1 scattering at forward angles including 0@xmath9  were greatly helpful .",
    "we used two self - supporting natural sulfur foils with thicknesses of 14.3 mg/@xmath20 for 0@xmath9 and of 15.6 mg/@xmath21 for finite angles .",
    "the sulfur target was prepared in the following procedure  @xcite . at first",
    ", the natural sulfur powder ( the abundance of @xmath0s is 95.02% ) was melted at the temperature of 112.8@xmath9c .",
    "the liquid sulfur was solidified between a couple of the teflon sheets with a well defined thickness .",
    "the target was kept cool during the measurement with liquid nitrogen by using the target cooling system described in ref .",
    "@xcite to avoid subliming the sulfur .",
    "inelastically scattered @xmath1  particles were momentum analyzed in the high resolution spectrometer , grand raiden  @xcite , and detected in the focal - plane detector system consisting of two multi - wire drift - chambers and two plastic scintillators . the scattering angle at the target and the momentum of the scattered particles were determined by the ray - tracing method .",
    "the energy spectra have been obtained in the range of 5 @xmath22 52 mev at @xmath23 = 2.5@xmath9  @xmath19 9@xmath9   and of 6 @xmath22 50 mev at 0@xmath9 .",
    "measurements were performed with two different energy - bite settings at each angle . in the 0@xmath9  measurements ,",
    "the primary beam was stopped at the just behind of the d2 magnet of grand raiden for the high excitation energy bite and at the downstream of the focal - plane detector system for the low excitation energy bite . at forward",
    "angles from 2.5@xmath9  to 5@xmath9 , the beam was stopped at the location just after the q1 magnet . at the backward angles over 6.5@xmath9 ,",
    "the beam was stopped in the scattering chamber of grand raiden .",
    "the energy resolution was less than 200 kev through all the runs .",
    "figure  [ fig : espec ] shows typical energy spectra at @xmath23 = 0.7@xmath9 and 4.2@xmath9 . in the forward angle measurements , especially at 0@xmath9 , backgrounds due to the beam halo and multiple coulomb - scattering become very large .",
    "however , we eliminated practically all the backgrounds using the double - focus property of the ion - optics of the grand raiden spectrometer , though the effect of the multiple coulomb - scattering was smaller in the @xmath0s(@xmath1,@xmath16 ) measurement than those in heavier nuclei such as @xmath24pb .",
    "elastic scattering from @xmath0s was also measured at @xmath25 = 4@xmath9 - 27@xmath9  to determine the nucleon-@xmath1   interaction parameters with the same incident energy .",
    "the mda has been carried out to extract multipole transition strengths from e0 to e3 , by taking into account the transferred angular momentum ( @xmath10 ) up to @xmath10 = 13 and minimizing the chi - square per degree of freedom .",
    "@xmath10 @xmath26 5 strengths were assumed to be backgrounds due to other physical processes such as quasielastic scattering in the ( @xmath1,@xmath16 ) reaction .",
    "the cross section data were binned in 1 mev energy intervals to reduce the fluctuation effects of the beam energy resolution .",
    "the experimentally obtained angular distributions , @xmath27 , have been fitted by means of the least square method with a linear combination of the calculated distributions , @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy weighted sum rule fraction for the @xmath10 component . in the dwba calculation , a single - folded potential model was employed , with a nucleon-@xmath1 interaction of the density - dependent gaussian form , as described in refs .",
    "the nucleon-@xmath1 interaction parameters are given by : @xmath31 where the ground state density @xmath32 was obtained using the point nucleon density unfolded from the charge density distribution  @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ddpint ] ) were determined by fitting the differential cross sections of elastic @xmath1-scattering measured for @xmath0s at @xmath37 = 386 mev ; the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : discrete ] , and the obtained parameters are presented in table  [ tab : interaction ] . the value @xmath36 = -1.9 was adopted from ref .",
    "the angular distribution of the 2.23 mev 2@xmath38 state was well reproduced with the known value of @xmath39 = 0.304  @xcite .",
    "contribution from the isovector giant dipole ( ivgdr ) component , arising from the coulomb - excitation , was subtracted above the excitation energy of 10 mev by using the gamma absorption cross section  @xcite . in the @xmath40 @xmath41 40 mev region ,",
    "ivgdr strength was approximated by the tail of the breit - wigner function to smoothly connect to the @xmath40 @xmath42 40 mev region .",

    "figure  [ fig : grmda ] shows typical fitting results of the mda . in the region above @xmath40 = 43.5 mev , the sum of @xmath10 @xmath26 5 components constituted dominant part of the cross section as shown at the right lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : grmda ] . therefore , energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) values , centroid energies , and r.m.s .",
    "widths for e0 , e1 , and e2 have been obtained by summing up from 6 to 43 mev .",
    "errors were estimated by changing the summing region to @xmath43 2 mev ( 6 - 41 mev and 6 - 45 mev ) .    a total of 108 @xmath44% of the e0 ewsr was found .",
    "the e0 centroid energy ( m1/m0 ) is 23.65 @xmath45 mev , and the rms width is 9.43 mev .",
    "the isoscalar e1 ewsr fraction is 103 @xmath43 11% .",
    "however , the isoscalar e1 strength continues up to @xmath46 mev , similar to that in @xmath4si  @xcite .",
    "the e2 strength was identified with 143 @xmath47% of the ewsr .",
    "the e2 centroid energy is 22.42 @xmath48 mev , and the rms width is 9.14 mev .    the sum of the e3 strength between 6 mev and 50 mev was found to correspond to only 33 @xmath49% ewsr .",
    "however , the low excitation energy part between 6 and 18 mev comprises about 3% of the ewsr which is equal to that reported in @xmath4si .",
    "it would appear that the high energy e3 ( heor ) strength between 18 and 43 mev could not be separated from higher multipole ( @xmath10 @xmath26 4 ) components .",
    "the centroid energy of the heor is 31.4 @xmath50 mev which is also comparable to that of @xmath4si .",
    "although the low excitation energy region of the e4 strength could be separated from higher multipole ( @xmath10 @xmath26 5 ) components , as described later , it was not possible to clearly identify the e4 strength above @xmath40@xmath41 25 mev due to featureless angular distributions , as shown in fig .",

    "the transition strengths were estimated by integrating the strength distribution corresponding to the states . it should be noted that their absolute values are strongly affected by the dwba calculation used in the mda .",
    "the extracted excitation energies and strengths are listed in table  [ tab : positive ] . in the @xmath10 = 0 strength distribution presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : strength - sd ] , there were many candidates for the e0 strength at @xmath40  @xmath53 14 mev .",
    "however , since the isovector e1 cross section due to the coulomb - force shows also a strong peak at 0@xmath9 similar to the e0 strength , it could not be excluded from the e0 strength at @xmath40  @xmath53 14 mev .",
    "a possible way to look at the ivgdr contribution is to compare the ( @xmath1,@xmath16 ) strength distributions with those obtained from ( p , p@xmath54 ) at similar energies .",
    "such data are available from ref .",
    "@xcite . from a comparison of the 0@xmath9 spectra between the ( @xmath1 , @xmath16 ) and ( p , p@xmath54 ) reactions , we identified six 0@xmath51 states in the e0 strength distribution of ( @xmath1,@xmath16 ) as listed in tables  [ tab : positive ] and  [ tab : negative ] .",
    "in light nuclei , the isoscalar giant monopole ( isgmr ) strength is fragmented into the wide excitation energy region , as reviewed in ref .  @xcite . in recent works on @xmath12",
    "mg , @xmath4si , @xmath13ca , and @xmath55ca  @xcite , a large part of the e0 strength was found over @xmath40@xmath19 20 mev . the e0 strength in @xmath0s was also found to be fragmented in the wide excitation energy region from 6 mev to 43 mev as shown in fig .  [ fig : strength](a ) .",
    "the e0 centroid energy of 23.65 @xmath45 mev is comparable to the empirical expression , e@xmath56 @xmath19 78 a@xmath57 , of 24.6 mev .",
    "as for the centroid energy of the isoscalar giant dipole resonance ( isgdr ) , the e1 strength continues up to @xmath40@xmath19 50 mev , as described in the previous section . the empirical expression of e@xmath58 @xmath19 133 a@xmath57 found in ref .",
    "@xcite becomes 41.9 mev .",
    "although the e1 strength was found almost 100% in this measurement , and since the absolute value of the strength is strongly affected by the dwba calculation used in the mda , it implies the measurement up to the sufficiently high excitation energy region is needed to find the whole strength of the isgdr in light nuclei such as @xmath0s .      the 0@xmath51 states at @xmath40= 10.49 mev , 11.62 mev , 11.90 mev are candidates for the bandhead state of the sd band .",
    "the bandhead 0@xmath51 state of the sd band in @xmath0s is predicted to appear at @xmath40  = 10 @xmath19 12 mev in the hf and hfb frameworks  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that this sd band is essentially identical to the pauli allowed lowest @xmath59 = 24 band of the @xmath60o+@xmath60o molecular structure  @xcite .",
    "it is tempting , to conjecture that these 0@xmath61 states might , indeed , be the bandhead of a sd band .",
    "extending this conjecture , we observe 2@xmath61 and 4@xmath61 members of the sd band above these excitation energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : rotational - band ] shows the two - dimensional histogram of the excitation energies versus the j(j+1 ) values . the solid lines are drown to guide the eye .",
    "the slope of these lines corresponds to @xmath62 83 kev .",
    "although this value is larger than predicted one of 48.5 kev in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is in good agreement with a simple calculation of @xmath63 85 kev obtained by the assumption of point masses for a rigid @xmath60o + @xmath60o molecular structure with the radius , r = 1.1 a@xmath64 fm .",
    "it is also comparable to @xmath65 = 82 kev and 69 kev of the sd bands observed in @xmath66ar  @xcite and @xmath13ca  @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , the experimental bandheads of the sd bands in @xmath66ar and @xmath13ca are at low excitation energies ( 4.33 mev and 5.21 mev , respectively ) in comparison with @xmath40  = 10 @xmath19 12 mev in @xmath0s",
    ". this high excitation energy of the bandhead might be a reason why the sd band has not been observed in @xmath67-ray spectroscopic studies so far  @xcite .    in a macroscopic analysis of the @xmath60o + @xmath60o rainbow scattering ,",
    "it was concluded that the low - spin 0@xmath51 , 2@xmath51 , 4@xmath51 , and 6@xmath51 states of the n = 24 @xmath60o + @xmath60o cluster band were fragmented  @xcite and in an elastic @xmath4si + @xmath1 scattering experiment , many fragmented 0@xmath51 states were observed  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 0@xmath51 states at @xmath40@xmath19 11 mev observed in the present work could be the candidates of fragmented 0@xmath51 states .",
    "the lower excitation energy 0@xmath51 states , at 6.6 mev and 7.9 mev , which are near the @xmath1-decay threshold energy in @xmath0s , are discussed in relation to the bandhead of the @xmath4si + @xmath1 cluster band in the analogy with the @xmath68c + @xmath1 cluster in @xmath60o and the @xmath60o + @xmath1 cluster in @xmath69ne  @xcite . since there are mirror configurations of the @xmath68c + @xmath1 and @xmath60o + @xmath1 clusters , these cluster structures lead the parity - doublet rotational bands .",
    "the appearance of a parity - doublet rotational band in the asymmetric intrinsic @xmath1 cluster configurations is also explained by a cluster model with a deep potential  @xcite .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines in fig .  [ fig : rotational - band ] are drawn to point out members of the parity - doublet @xmath4si + @xmath1 cluster band in @xmath0s .",
    "the rotational constants @xmath65 corresponding to the dashed and dotted lines are 234 kev and 125 kev , respectively .",
    "the gap energy between the positive and the negative bands for the dashed line is almost zero .",
    "it indicates the @xmath4si + @xmath1 cluster structure in this band has a rigid body .",
    "the value of 234 kev is in good agreement with a simple calculation of 245 kev obtained with the assumption of point masses for a rigid @xmath4si + @xmath1 cluster with a radius r = 1.1 a@xmath64 fm for @xmath4si , and 1.6 fm for the @xmath1-particle .",
    "however , these simple calculations of the rotational constant are just trials to explain the experimentally - observed rotational constants .",
    "more realistic theoretical calculations are highly desired for the further detailed comparison with the experimental results .",
    "we have investigated the isoscalar giant resonance strengths in the doubly - closed shell nucleus @xmath0s , with a view to search for the possible superdeformed bandhead predicted in theoretical calculations . a novel technique was used to prepare an enriched @xmath0s target , and the @xmath0s(@xmath1,@xmath16 ) measurements were made at extremely forward angles , including 0@xmath9 at e@xmath2 = 386 mev .",
    "the extracted e0 , e1 , e2 , and e3 strength distributions from mda are similar to those in nearby light nuclei . from the mda with a 200 kev energy bin , three 0@xmath51 states at 10.49 mev , 11.62 mev , and 11.90 mev are extracted .",
