    "we are entering an age where gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors will be sufficiently sensitive to observe a host of astrophysical sources .",
    "this has led to a flurry of activity among astrophysicists to estimate the characteristics of sources of gw emission .",
    "one source class that has been the subject of much study is the collapse of massive stars to form compact remnants ( either neutron stars or black holes ) . within this broad class ,",
    "the collapse of supernova progenitors ( typically @xmath1 m stars ) has received particularly strong scrutiny .",
    "most studies have concentrated on calculating the gw emission during collapse , or the emission from bar - like instabilities shortly after bounce ( see rampp , mller , & ruffert 1998 for a review ) .",
    "however , the general class of stellar collapse includes a rather wide variety of astrophysical objects .",
    "such objects range from the collapse of a white dwarf whose mass is pushed just beyond the chandrasekhar limit via accretion ( accretion induced collapse , or aic ; see liu & lindblom 2001 ) to the collapse of very massive stars , in excess of 260 m ( fryer , woosley , & heger 2001 ) .",
    "although there is little doubt that stellar collapse produces gws , it is difficult to accurately estimate the characteristics of the signal produced .",
    "the amount of radiation depends sensitively upon the rotation rate of the collapsing object .",
    "the choice of pre - collapse rotation can make a large difference in the resulting gw signal ( brown 2001 ) , particularly in the case of bar - mode instability calculations in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "simulations generally suffer from two deficiencies .",
    "first , most collapse simulations use simplified equations of state that do not include the effects of neutrinos . although neutrinos may not be important at early times ( e.g. , the simulations of rampp et al .",
    "1998 ) , at later times they strongly affect the material dynamics and can not be neglected . in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the results from a series of recent stellar - collapse simulations ( fryer et al .",
    "1999a ; fryer & heger 2000 ; fryer et al .",
    "2001 ) which followed stellar collapse to late times with realistic equations of state and neutrino physics .",
    "second , until recently no models of the progenitors of stellar collapse have included the effects of rotation , so that there has been little information available to constrain their initial spin . recently , however , heger ( 1998 ) has developed a stellar evolution code which includes a number of angular momentum transport processes and can evolve massive stars to collapse .",
    "he found that the rotation speeds of collapsing supernova cores were much smaller than those used in most calculations of gw emission from core - collapse ( e.g. rampp et al . 1998 ) . in this paper , we re - investigate the gw emission from stellar collapse using these latest progenitors in an effort to calculate a gw signal which more closely reflects what is produced in nature .",
    "our goal in this analysis is to make reasonable estimates for the gw strength from stellar collapse , and in particular to identify which scenarios lead to interesting gw sources for detectors such as ligo . for each of the scenarios that we consider ( accretion induced collapse , core - collapse supernovae , collapse of @xmath2 m stars ) we examine the gw emission from bulk mass motions , from mass currents , and from the `` ringing '' of a black hole ( if one is produced ) . in this analysis we can not precisely model gw production ",
    "our axisymmetric code can not follow 3-dimensional instabilities , nor the complicated behavior for very long after collapse .",
    "we thus make a number of important assumptions and approximations to estimate gw characteristics , sufficient to accomplish the goal of this paper : to derive reasonable estimates for the frequency and strain of gw output .",
    "gws from mass motion are computed in three ways .",
    "first , we numerically evaluate the quadrupole moment and its rate of change from the axisymmetric simulations .",
    "these waves come from polar - type oscillations , and do not account for the instabilities caused by rotation .",
    "this axisymmetric estimate should strongly underestimate the gw emission from a source .",
    "second , we assume the evolution of the system may lead to a bar - mode instability , and calculate the gw emission from the bar - mode that might develop .",
    "there are indications that the mass and angular momentum of some of our systems are in the range where secular , and perhaps dynamical , bar - mode instabilities develop .",
    "we estimate the bar gw strength over a range of evolutionary outcomes . finally ,",
    "as a physically motivated upper limit to gw production , we consider a fragmentation instability , wherein the star s interior fragments into clumps .",
    "we model these clumps as a binary system .",
    "this binary is a rather strong radiator , and yields a reasonable upper bound on the gws possible from a stellar source .",
    "it is not clear if such an instability would actually occur in a realistic collapse , but it has not been ruled out ( fryer et al .",
    "indeed , we note that van putten ( 2001 ) has recently argued that a similar instability may be a source of copious gws during long duration gamma ray bursts .",
    "the r - mode instability produces gws from mass currents .",
    "we estimate the r - mode wave characteristics following the approach of ho & lai ( 2000 ) . this instability can be activated in a newly born , hot neutron star .",
    "it may also be reawakened when material falls back onto the neutron star after it has cooled  the fallback material heats and spins up the star .    in some evolutionary scenarios",
    "a black hole is formed .",
    "the nascent black hole is likely to be quite distorted from the quiescent kerr form , and remains so as material falls back onto it in the first seconds or minutes of its life .",
    "this distortion drives the hole to radiate as it settles down to a kerr state ; the emitted waves are called `` ringing '' waves since they are qualitatively similar to the ringing of a bell .",
    "we estimate the strength and detectability of these waves using some simplifying assumptions about the distribution of infalling matter and the manner in which it distorts the hole .    in all cases",
    "we compare the expected wave strain from our sources with the noise in the broad - band configuration of enhanced ligo interferometers ( `` ligo - ii '' , see gustafson et al .",
    "the comparison is based on a measure of the characteristic noise strain which assumes good knowledge of the source s characteristics ( `` matched filtering '' ; see appendix a for further details ) . it is worth noting that other data analysis techniques are likely to be very useful in searching for these waves ( for example",
    ", the @xmath3 technique of van putten & sarkar ( 2000 ) would probably do very well at following the evolution of the black hole ringing frequency as its mass and spin evolve due to accretion ) .",
    "since we are only interested in a first broad discussion of these waves , we do not consider these other data analysis techniques here .",
    "ligo is just one of several ground - based gravititational - wave interferometers currently planned or under construction . in europe",
    ", a french - italian collaboration is building the 3 kilometer virgo interferometer near pisa , italy ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it will operate in the same time frame as ligo , and is expected to have very similar noise characteristics .",
    "[ one exception is that virgo will use a very sophisticated seismic isolation system that promises to move the low frequency noise `` wall '' from about 10 hz ( ligo ) to roughly 3 or 4 hz . ]",
    "a british - german collaboration is building the 600 meter geo600 interferometer near hannover , germany ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of geo s major goals is to use advanced interferometry techniques and technology from the beginning .",
    "as well as serving as a useful testbed for design ideas that will be used to improve ligo and virgo , this design compensates for geo s shorter arms and enables it to achieve sensitivity comparable to that of the multi - kilometer instruments . in japan",
    ", the tama collaboration is currently operating a 300 meter interferometer near tokyo ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this interferometer is being used as a testbed for a future multi - kilometer instrument with cryogenically cooled mirrors that they hope to build in the kamioka mine ( @xcite ) .",
    "tama is of sufficient sensitivity to detect gravitational - wave events within the milky way and nearby galaxies .",
    "finally , there are plans to build a ligo - scale detector in western australia , near perth ( @xcite ) .",
    "this would be a particularly valuable addition to the stable of detectors since the northern hemisphere detectors lie very nearly within a common plane",
    ". an australian detector would be far outside of this plane , allowing it to play an important role in determining the location of sources on the sky .    in the frequency band of greatest interest to this analysis ( @xmath4 hz or so )",
    ", the different interferometers have sensitivities that are very similar to one another . our discussion , which focuses on ligo - ii , carries over with little change to the other instruments . at low frequencies",
    ", virgo may have some advantage because of their aggressive seismic isolation design ; in particular , they may have a better chance of detecting waves from the death of population iii stars ( which are at low frequencies because of the cosmological redshift ) . in any case",
    ", we provide enough information for the interested reader to compare our estimated wavestrains with the sensitivity of detectors other than ligo - ii .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the various mechanisms that lead to gw emission in  2 , and then apply them to collapse progenitors in  3 ( aic ) ,  4 ( core - collapse supernovae ) , and  5 ( collapse of very massive stars ) . in each of these sections we review current constraints on collapse rates and discuss the detectability of the gws .",
    "background for the detectability discussion is reviewed in appendix a. in several places we discuss sources at cosmological distances . to convert between redshift and luminosity distance ( @xcite )",
    ", we assume a flat universe with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and with a hubble parameter @xmath7 .",
    "( bahcall et al . 1999 ) . a summary of the results concludes the paper .",
    "the collapse of massive stars involves a large amount of mass ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) , in a fairly compact region ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) , moving at relativistic velocities ( @xmath12)precisely the conditions needed for strong gw generation . in what follows",
    "we will explore a number of gw emission mechanisms , including large - scale mass flows ( quadrupole oscillations , bar - mode and fragmentation instabilities ) , large - scale mass currents ( r - mode instability ) , and emission from the ringing of a newly - formed black hole .",
    "each mechanism operates in a different regime , and the nature of gw emission depends sensitively upon the evolutionary development of the source .",
    "we will consider each mechanism in turn , discussing when each becomes important , and estimating the strength of the resulting gravitational radiation .",
    "we begin with a very brief review of gw theory ; further detail and references can be found in thorne ( 1987 ) .",
    "the conventional approach to calculating the gw emission of a given mass distribution is via a multipole expansion of the perturbation @xmath13 to a background spacetime @xmath14 .",
    "the transverse - traceless projection of this metric , evaluated in the radiation zone , is the metric of the radiation field .",
    "the lowest ( quadrupole ) order piece of this field is ( thorne 1980 ) @xmath15^{\\rm tt}. \\label{eq : thorne1}\\ ] ] here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mass and current quadrupole moments of the source , @xmath18 is the distance from the source to the point of measurement , @xmath19 is the antisymmetric tensor , and @xmath20 is the unit vector pointing in the propagation direction .",
    "parentheses in the subscripts indicate symmetrization over the enclosed indices , and the superscript tt indicates that one is to take the transverse - traceless projection ; @xmath21 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath22 is the speed of light .",
    "most gw estimates are based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : thorne1 ] ) .",
    "when bulk mass motions dominate the dynamics , the first term describes the radiation .",
    "for example , this term gives the well - known `` chirp '' associated with binary inspiral .",
    "we will use it to model bar - mode and fragmentation instabilities .",
    "at least conceptually , this term also applies to black hole ringing , provided one interprets @xmath23 as a moment of the spacetime rather than as a mass moment ( @xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "ringing waves are computed by finding solutions to the wave equation for gravitational radiation ( @xcite ) with appropriate boundary conditions ( radiation purely ingoing at the hole s event horizon , purely outgoing at infinity ; see leaver 1985 for further discussion ) .",
    "the second term in eq.([eq : thorne1 ] ) gives radiation from mass currents , and is used to calculate gw emission due to the r - mode instability .",
    "when the background spacetime is flat ( or nearly so ) the mass and current moments have particularly simple forms .",
    "for example , in cartesian coordinates the mass quadrupole is given by @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the mass density , and @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "the second term in the integrand ensures that the resulting tensor is trace free .",
    "gravitational waves carry away energy and angular momentum from the source ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lowest order contribution to the power @xmath29 emitted in gws is due to variations in the quadrupole moment : @xmath30 where the dots refer to time derivatives . for the purpose of detectability estimates ,",
    "it is usually more important to know the dimensionless strain @xmath31 associated with a source .",
    "this strain gives the fractional change in distance between two separated masses as a gw passes by ; it is the quantity that is directly measured by gw detectors .",
    "the tensor field @xmath32 encodes two polarizations , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these polarizations can pulled out of @xmath32 with appropriate projection operators ( see @xcite for expressions and further discussion ) . the rms strain associated with a source",
    "is then given by @xmath35 , where the angle brackets denote both an average over several wavelengths and an average over the sky .",
    "this rms strain will be used in all of our analyses .    in general , the relation between strain and power scales as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gw frequency and @xmath18 is the luminosity distance to the source . for a given strain ,",
    "higher frequency waves radiate more energy . because of detector noise , however , higher frequency waves are not necessarily more detectable .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss five different approximation methods which are valid under varying conditions during stellar collapse .",
    "the first three ( numerical quadrupole formalism , bar mode formation , fragmentation instability ) can be used to get a handle on gw emission during the collapse itself , while the latter two ( r - modes and black hole ringing ) occur after the formation of a compact remnant .",
    "it is possible to directly apply eq .",
    "( [ quad ] ) to the results of a numerical simulation . by evaluating the quadrupole moment on multiple time slices",
    ", one can compute the time derivatives numerically , and thereby determine the gw emission .",
    "computing time derivatives across many slices , however , can generate an unacceptable amount of numerical noise .",
    "an alternate approach , based upon work by blanchet et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and used extensively by zwerger & mller ( 1997 ) , rewrites the time derivatives as spatial derivatives , thereby avoiding the need to consider multiple time slices when calculating instantaneous power emission .",
    "both the velocities of the particles and the newtonian potential are known on a given slice .",
    "the gradient of the potential yields the forces acting on the particles , and , coupled with the velocity information , determines what the next slice will look like .",
    "therefore , by utilizing the gradients directly , it is possible to calculate the gw emission while restricting oneself to a single numerical slice .",
    "the expression we use to do this in the axisymmetric case comes from zwerger & mller ( 1997 ) .",
    "the only non - vanishing quadrupole wave amplitude component , @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39\\;. \\label{zm_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] spherical coordinates are used here , with @xmath40 ; @xmath41 is the newtonian gravitational potential . the non - zero wave strain component is then given by @xmath42 , where @xmath18 is the luminosity distance to the source .",
    "although our code is axially symmetric ( such that all the @xmath43 terms vanish ) , eq .",
    "( [ zm_eq ] ) still yields non - zero gw emission due to polar - type oscillations .",
    "these modes become important when there is large _ aspherical _ mass infall ( or ejection ) .",
    "however , we would strongly underestimate gw emission if we restricted ourselves to these modes  emission should be much stronger in cases where the tangential motion of particles dominates the radial motion .",
    "we now discuss a number of non - axisymmetric modes which our code is unable to reproduce directly .",
    "a bar mode instability is one of the more promising mechanisms by which a significant fraction of the collapsing system s energy can be emitted in gws .",
    "bar mode instabilities occur in objects whose rotational kinetic energy exceeds some fraction of their potential energy , with the ratio generally written as @xmath44 .",
    "standard lore ( chandrasekhar 1969 ) states that an object is unstable on a secular time scale if @xmath45 , and is dynamically unstable if @xmath46 .",
    "[ we note , though , that recent work suggests that if the collapse hangs due to centrifugal forces producing a density profile which is not centrally peaked , dynamical instabilities can occur at a much lower value of @xmath47 ( centrella et al .",
    "2000 ) . ]    in most core - collapse simulations done with up - to - date progenitor models , it is found that the mass distribution does not become centrifugally hung up .",
    "this suggests that instability to bar mode formation might be unlikely : in these simulations , the density is centrally concentrated , and thus the low critical values of centrella et al .",
    "( 2000 ) do not apply .",
    "high values of @xmath47 are necessary to induce bar - mode instabilities",
    ". fortunately , the rotational energy can be very high in these models ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and it remains likely that bar - mode instabilities will occur .    heartened by these results , we review here expressions describing bar mode gw emission . consider a bar of mass @xmath48 and length @xmath49 , rotating with angular frequency @xmath50 .",
    "the gw energy radiated is given , in the quadrupole approximation , by @xmath51 a detector at a distance @xmath18 from the source would measure an rms strain @xmath52 note that , due to symmetry , the frequency of the emitted gws is twice the bar s rotation frequency .      to set a physically motivated upper limit to the gw emission that might be produced in stellar collapse , we imagine that the collapse material fragments into clumps , which then orbit for some number of cycles as the collapse proceeds . for concreteness",
    "we consider the material fragmenting into a binary system , though it could very well fragment into more objects .",
    "we note that collapse simulations give some indication that this kind of instability may be present ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , van putten has recently argued that a fragmentation - type instability in collapsar powered gamma - ray bursts may drive very strong gw emission ( @xcite ) .    for two bodies , each of mass @xmath48 , in circular orbit about one another at a frequency @xmath50 and with separation @xmath49 , the power and mean strain",
    "are given by : @xmath53 these results make no assumption about orbital frequency , and so apply to , for example , pressure supported as well as keplerian orbits .",
    "for keplerian orbits we have @xmath54 , and the above expressions become @xmath55 note that if the `` horizons '' of the two bodies touch ( @xmath56 ) , then the power radiated reaches a maximum of @xmath57 , independent of the mass of the system . the length of time such power emission is sustained , however , scales with the total mass ( thus supermassive black hole binaries radiate more than microscopic ones ) .",
    "if the collapse forms a neutron star , an r - mode instability can arise at late times , once the neutron star has cooled .",
    "this instability has attracted much attention in the past few years , fueled by the discovery by andersson ( 1998 ) and friedman & morsink ( 1998 ) that gravitational radiation drives r - mode instabilities in rotating neutron stars [ see lindblom ( 2001 ) for a review ] .",
    "unfortunately , an accurate calculation of gws from the r - mode instability requires an understanding of the growth and maximum limit of the r - mode amplitude which , in turn , requires an understanding of the viscous terms that act to damp the modes ( e.g. , shear and bulk viscosities in the neutron star fluid , shear viscosities caused by crusts , magnetic viscosities , etc . ) .",
    "for instance , rezzolla , lamb , and shapiro ( 2000 ) found that poloidal fields as low as @xmath58 g could damp out r - modes .",
    "these viscous terms depend upon the neutron star structure and equation of state . on top of these uncertainties ,",
    "the gw signal depends upon the formation and evolution of young neutron stars ( especially during the first 1000s ) , and hence is subject to the various uncertainties associated with those processes .    for our study of gws from r - modes , we use the simplified equations derived by ho & lai ( 2000 ) , which consider only the dominant @xmath59 mode with the initial neutron star structure from owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : @xmath60=1.4 m , @xmath61=12.53 km ( which follows from a polytropic equation of state with index @xmath62 ) .",
    "the spin frequency ( @xmath63 ) evolution of the neutron star from ho & lai ( 2000 ) is : @xmath64 where the viscous timescale ( @xmath65 ) is given by : @xmath66 with @xmath67 and the neutron star temperature @xmath68k . for most of our calculations",
    "we assume that the temperature evolves with time under the prescription of owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : @xmath69 .",
    "the r - mode amplitude @xmath70 is driven by gravitational radiation and damped by viscous forces : @xmath71 the gravitational radiation timescale ( @xmath72 ) is given by : @xmath73 with this prescription the r - mode amplitude would grow to very large values unless we set some critical amplitude . as in ho & lai ( 2000 ) , if the mode amplitude rises above 1 , we hold it constant and the spin evolution becomes : @xmath74 ho & lai included the effects of magnetic breaking ( via radiation from a dipole magnetic field ) in the newly formed pulsar , and we discuss these effects in   3 and 4 .",
    "we also examine the effect of fallback accretion onto the collapsed remnant . in core - collapse supernovae",
    "it is likely that @xmath75 m of material will fall back onto the newly formed neutron star @xmath76s after the explosion .",
    "the angular momentum of this fallback material leads to the formation of an accretion disk which spins up the neutron star as it accretes : @xmath77 we assume that the angular momentum per unit mass accreted onto the star is equal to that of a keplerian orbit at the neutron star surface : @xmath78",
    "we also assume that the change in the moment of inertia ( @xmath79 ) is limited to the change in mass ( the radius remains constant ) : @xmath80 this assumption is adequate to get the qualitative flavor of the accretion effects on gw emission from r - modes .",
    "typical fallback accretion rates for supernovae which produce neutron stars peak in the range @xmath81@xmath82ms@xmath83 ( fryer , colgate , & pinto 1999b ) .",
    "such high rates quickly smother any magnetic field , heating up the neutron star .",
    "the neutron star temperature is set by the temperature at the surface of the neutron star ( fryer et al .",
    "1999b ) : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the entropy of the infalling material . for a @xmath86 polytrope ,",
    "this is given by ( fryer et al .",
    "1999b ) : @xmath87    combining the equations for the evolution of the neutron star spin and the r - mode amplitude with ho & lai s ( 2000 ) definition for the average wave amplitude @xmath88 yields @xmath89 we use this formula to estimate r - mode gw emission in newly collapsed stars .",
    "if the stellar collapse forms a black hole instead of a neutron star , a different mechanism produces gws .",
    "the properties of the black hole during collapse rapidly change as material from the star falls onto it , increasing its mass and possibly its spin .",
    "the infalling matter also perturbs the hole s geometry , distorting it from the kerr solution .",
    "this distortion causes the hole to `` ring '' in distinct harmonics as gravitational radiation carries away the perturbation and the hole settles into a quiescent , stationary kerr state .",
    "an accurate calculation of this ringing would require a code that calculates the perturbation spectrum given a mass inflow .",
    "here we take a much simpler approach , approximating the spectrum as a stochastic superposition of kerr quasi - normal modes arising from repeated `` thumping '' by the matter flow onto the nascent black hole .",
    "although this analysis is not adequate to rigorously detail the characteristics of the ringing waves emitted during massive star collapse , it should be adequate to estimate the waves strength and detectability .",
    "we hope to motivate more careful analyses that use inflow codes to compute the emitted waves ( an early example of which is described in papadopoulos & font 2001 ) .",
    "a black hole distortion can be decomposed into spheroidal modes with spherical - harmonic - like indices @xmath90 and @xmath48 .",
    "the quadrupole modes ( @xmath91 ) presumably dominate , while the dominant @xmath48 value depends upon the matter flow .",
    "the @xmath92 modes are bar - like , co - rotating ( @xmath93 ) and counter - rotating ( @xmath94 ) with the hole s spin ; the @xmath95 mode represents a shift of the black hole s position ; and the @xmath96 mode is an axisymmetric distortion . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the hole rings entirely in @xmath96 and @xmath97 modes .",
    "we exclude @xmath98 because it is difficult to estimate their importance without detailed calculations of the ringing spectrum , and we exclude @xmath99 because it is likely to be strongly suppressed [ it is counter to the spacetime s rotation , and has an extremely short lifetime ( see chandrasekhar 1983 , fig .  45 ) ] .",
    "we will vary the fraction of energy radiated in @xmath96 and @xmath97 waves to see how the detectability of these events varies with the nature of the hole s distortion .",
    "each quasi - normal mode has a unique frequency @xmath100 and damping time @xmath101 , depending only on the hole s mass and spin ( @xcite ) .",

    "since the white dwarf is pushed over the chandrasekhar mass limit through disk accretion , it is likely that the collapsing white dwarf will rotate at a significant rate , allowing for the possibility of a variety of instabilities , and the concomitant emission of gws .",
    "the analysis in this paper relies upon the rotating simulation ( model 3 ) of fryer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "calculating the formation rate of aics from first principles is fraught with difficulties , ranging from understanding binary star evolution to uncertainties in the accretion process itself .",
    "we have already mentioned one such uncertainty : does the star ignite in a thermonuclear explosion or collapse to form an aic ? at present",
    "we have only a rudimentary understanding of the conditions necessary for a white dwarf to gain matter during the accretion process ( as opposed to losing matter via a series of nova explosions ) .",

    "unfortunately , whether or not the current mass - transfer progenitors actually lead to an increase in the white dwarf mass to the chandrasekhar limit is still a matter of hot debate ( contrast kato & hachisu 1999 with cassisi , iben & tornamb 1998 ) .",

    "although calculating this fraction may be easier than calculating a rate directly , at present we are unable to make accurate estimates .    by modeling the collapse itself , however , we can place constraints on the aic rate . during the collapse the white dwarf ejects the outer @xmath1420.1 m of its envelope , some of which had become very neutron rich due to electron capture . as this material",

    "what about the angular momentum distribution of these collapsing stars ?",
    "the white dwarf is pushed above the chandrasekhar mass either by accretion or through the merger of two white dwarfs . in either case",
    "the process by which the white dwarf gains mass also causes the white dwarf to gain a considerable amount of angular momentum .",
    "one can roughly estimate the rate of angular momentum gain by assuming all of the angular momentum at the inner edge of the accretion disk is added to the white dwarf : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the accretion rate , @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @xmath146 is the mass of the white dwarf , and @xmath147 is the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "a 2500 km , 1.35 m white dwarf ( with @xmath148 set to the white dwarf radius ) accreting 0.05 m gains @xmath149 in angular momentum .",
    "given the small moment of inertia of white dwarfs ( typically , @xmath150 ) , this small amount of accretion can cause an initially non - rotating neutron star to achieve rotation rates greater than 1rads@xmath83 , or periods less than 6s .",
    "it should be noted , though , that rotation periods for cataclysmic variables typically range from 2001200s ( liebert 1980 ) [ although periods as low as @xmath151s exist ( king & lasota 1991 ) ] .",
    "most white dwarfs lose mass during accretion due to novae , and this may limit the amount of angular momentum accreted ( e.g. king , wynn , & regev 1991 ) .",
    "it is possible that those white dwarfs which actually gain mass up to the chandrasekhar mass may have much faster spin periods than the observed sample .",
    "even so , the actual spin period before collapse depends upon a variety of uncertainties : white dwarf radius , accretion rate , magnetic field strength , etc .",
    "( e.g. narayan & popham 1989 ) .",
    "for the purposes of our analysis , we assume that the white dwarf collapsed with @xmath152 ( fig .",
    "liu & lindblom ( 2001 ) have recently studied white dwarfs with more angular momentum ( @xmath153@xmath154 ) , and we will compare our results with theirs below .",
    "as we discussed in  2 , bar - mode instabilities are driven when the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to potential energy ( @xmath47 ) exceeds some critical value .",
    "toroidal density distributions ( where the density peaks some distance away from the center of the object ) are more susceptible to bar - mode instabilities , and may develop these instabilities for @xmath155 ( tohline & hachisu 1990 ; centrella et al .",
    "the collapse of a rotating white dwarf does produce a density distribution peaked away from the center ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and the critical @xmath47 may be as low as tohline & hachisu ( 1990 ) predict . however , for our choice of initial spin , @xmath47 is less than 0.06 . for aics ,",
    "the boundary between proto - neutron star and ejected material is generally very sharp , but in core - collapse supernovae it is sometimes difficult to define the edge of the proto - neutron star .",
    "hence we have calculated @xmath47 as a function of enclosed mass , where @xmath47 corresponds to the total rotational energy and potential energy in that enclosed mass .",
    "note that no matter where we define the edge of the neutron star , @xmath156 .",
    "that said , we should bear in mind that the higher angular momentum white dwarfs of liu & lindblom ( 2001 ) are almost certainly unstable .",

    "the strength of these waves is an encouraging sign that , _ if _ stronger instabilities such as bar mode formation were to become active , they would likely be of great observational importance ( though these polar observations are not themselves observationally interesting ) .      for the first 1020s after collapse and explosion from the aic , the proto - neutron star remnant remains electron rich .",
    "electron neutrinos ( created via electron capture onto protons ) deleptonize the neutron star , but since the degeneracy energy of electrons is less than the energy carried away by the neutrinos ( that is , the energy released through electron capture is more than the energy carried away by the neutrinos produced in electron capture ) , the neutron star initially heats up ( keil & janka 1995 ) .",
    "it can take up to 50s before the temperature falls below @xmath58k . by this time",
    "the proto - neutron star has contracted to nearly its final radius . assuming a 1.4 m , 12.53 km neutron star ( @xmath62 polytrope ) , the moment of inertia is only @xmath160g@xmath161 .",
    "as long as the total angular momentum is above @xmath162 , the period will be below 1ms , and the neutron star remnant will be an ideal candidate for strong r - mode emission",
    ". however , r - modes are highly damped until the temperature ( and hence the bulk viscosity ) decreases below @xmath58k .",
    "in our analysis , we assume the neutron star has contracted after 10s and using @xmath163 , @xmath164 at this time .",
    "as the proto - neutron star cools , the r - mode amplitude grows and converts much of the rotational energy into gw emission ( fig .",
    "4 ; solid line ) . to compare with ho & lai ( 2000 ) , we have assumed a spin frequency set to 890hz . if instead the neutron star is initially much hotter , but cools faster ( @xmath165 ) , the gw signal occurs later , but the strength and rough structure is nearly the same ( fig .",

    "the track illustrates the strength of the waves if it were possible to coherently integrate the signal s phase evolution over the course of 1 year .",
    "the wave track is below the mean noise everywhere on the plot , indicating that these waves are not detectable .",
    "this is not too surprising , since one typically discusses r - mode strength for sources no more than about 20 mpc away  100 mpc is just too far for the source to be detectable .",
    "the above calculations assume that the neutron star has also acquired a @xmath168 g dipole magnetic field and is emitting as a pulsar ( however , we neglect any damping effects caused by magnetic fields ) . in the first year , a total of @xmath169ergs is lost through pulsar emission , most of which will power the accelerated ejection of the exploding material . this energy is less than 0.1% of the explosion energy , and only 0.001% of the total rotation energy .",
    "although this energy will not make a difference in the supernova light curve at early times , the pulsar luminosity remains high long after the supernova and gw emission has died away , and will easily be visible after the ejecta has cleared .",
    "a @xmath170 g magnetic field pulsar is similar ( @xmath171 ) . at @xmath172 g",
    ", the pulsar mechanism will produce observable effects in the supernova explosion at peak , even though less than 10% of the rotational energy is going into pulsar emission .",
    "if aics do produce such highly magnetized , rapidly rotating stars , we should observe the pulsar outbursts .",
    "unfortunately , at a rate of @xmath143 per year in the galaxy , we only expect 01 such events in our current sample of supernovae .",
    "stars more massive than @xmath1428 m also end in core - collapse . during their lives successive stages of nuclear burning build up a massive iron core in the stellar center .",
    "this iron core is supported by electron degeneracy and thermal pressures .",
    "when the density and temperature in the core become so high that iron is dissociated into alpha particles and electron capture occurs , the support pressure is suddenly removed and the core collapses .",
    "as it collapses , the core density and temperature increases , causing more iron dissociation and electron capture which leads to a runaway infall of the core .",
    "just as with aics , the core collapses until it reaches nuclear densities , where nuclear forces and neutron degeneracy pressure abruptly halt the collapse .",
    "astronomers have long understood that the potential energy released as a star collapses down to a neutron star could power a supernova explosion ( baade & zwicky 1934 ) .",
    "however , it was not until 1966 that colgate & white realized that neutrinos could be the medium which transported energy released during the collapse of the core into the outer layers of the star , which would subsequently explode and drive the supernova explosion . since this time astronomers have continued to refine the neutrino - driven model .",
    "indeed , core - collapse supernovae are one of the few objects in astronomy that astronomers do not invoke fudge factors to explain ( albeit , this means that we do not yet match the observations all that well ) .    the basic mechanism behind core - collapse supernovae has developed from three decades of study and is very similar to aics .",
    "the main difference arises from the fact that the proto - neutron star must somehow eject @xmath173 m of material , instead of 0.1 m as in the case of aics .",
    "after bounce , the inner portion of the star rains down upon the proto - neutron star , preventing a quick , aic - like explosion .",
    "a convective layer above the proto - neutron star and below the pressure cap of the infalling material converts the heat deposited by neutrinos into kinetic energy , aiding the explosion .",
    "eventually , the energy in the convective layer is sufficient to overcome the ram pressure and a supernova explosion is launched .    as the mass of the collapsing star increases , the basic picture described above of core - collapse supernovae begins to change . above 2025 m",
    ", the supernova explosion is too weak to eject the entire star , and much of the star ( @xmath174 m ) falls back onto the neutron star 100100,000s after the supernova explosion ( and after the gw emission ) .",
    "this fallback matter pushes the remnant mass above the maximum neutron star mass , and it collapses to form a black hole . beyond @xmath1424050 m , the convective layer is unable to overcome the pressure of the infalling material .",
    "no supernova explosion is launched and the star collapses to form a black hole .",
    "these direct - collapse stars will differ from normal core - collapse simulations in both gw emission and optical output .",
    "they are known as `` collapsars '' , and constitute one of the favored models for gamma - ray bursts ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "unfortunately , beyond @xmath1424050 m , mass - loss from stellar winds can dramatically change the mass of the star before collapse , and it may be that nature does not produce any high - metallicity collapsar progenitors .",
    "the formation rate of core - collapse supernovae is fairly well known , and lies somewhere between 1 per 50140 years in the galaxy ( cappellaro et al 1997 ) .",
    "540% of these supernovae produce black holes through fallback accretion ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "because mass - loss from winds are uncertain , the fraction of massive stars which collapse directly into black holes is much less well determined ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) . and for all core - collapse models , we do not know the fraction of these massive stars ( if any ) that are rotating rapidly enough to emit detectable amounts of gws .",
    "one way to get a handle on the angular momentum is to study pulsars , the compact remnants of core - collapse supernovae . from measurements of young pulsars we know that at least some neutron stars are born with periods faster than 20ms . but whether or not any neutron stars are born with millisecond periods is hard to ascertain .",
    "the problem is that pulsars spin down as they emit radiation , but we do nt know exactly how fast the spin - down occurs .",
    "the most recent analysis by chernoff & cordes ( private communication ) found that they could fit the initial spin periods with a gaussian distribution peaking at 7ms with sub - ms pulsars lying beyond the 2-sigma tail .",
    "does this mean that less than @xmath175 of pulsars are born spinning with millisecond periods , or does it mean that many pulsars are born spinning rapidly and gw emission removes a considerable amount of their angular momentum ? in addition , the analysis of chernoff & cordes is very sensitive to their choice of spin down rates and other uncertainties in their population study , and they stress that such results should be taken with a great deal of caution .",
    "stellar theorists have now produced models of core - collapse progenitors which include angular momentum ( heger 1998 ) .",
    "although these simulations include a number of assumptions about the angular momentum transport in the massive star , they give us some handle on the angular momentum distribution in the collapsing core .",
    "we base our analysis on the angular momentum profiles from the core - collapse simulations of fryer & heger ( 2000 ) , which uses these latest progenitors and modeled the core - collapse through supernova explosion ( models 1,5 ; fig .",
    "the angular momentum in these collapsing cores is much less than what is typically used in gw calculations , and we ll discuss the differences in the results below .        because the angular momentum distributions used by fryer & heger ( 2000 ) have peak values significantly lower than those used in the past , there is no centrifugal hang - up .",
    "the collapse proceeds nearly identically to a non - rotating star , with a density distribution peaked at the center of the star ( fig .",
    "this makes it harder for bar - mode instabilities to develop and produces weaker gw emission . during bounce ,",
    "the neutron star is not compact enough to quickly drive bar - mode instabilities .",
    "however , fryer & heger ( 2000 ) found that the explosion produced by these rotating core - collapse supernovae is much stronger along the poles than along the equator , causing more of the low angular - momentum material to be ejected .",
    "hence , after the explosion ( @xmath176s after collapse ) , @xmath47 can increase to high enough values that bar - mode instabilities are likely to develop ( fig .",
    "the proto - neutron star extends in all cases beyond @xmath1421 m , corresponding to values of @xmath47 which are certainly above the secular instability limit and probably above the dynamic instability limit ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "notice in fig .",
    "1 that @xmath47 is actually larger for the model which has less angular momentum .",
    "this is because this model has contracted more and is spinning more rapidly",
    ".    numerical evaluation of the quadrupole formula (  2.1 ) predicts a peak strain of @xmath177 at 10mpc and at @xmath178 hz .",
    "the total energy released in gws is about @xmath179ergs .",
    "these results are comparable to those for aics .",
    "however , since core - collapse supernovae are nearly 1,000 times more common than aics , we are much more likely to detect a nearby core - collapse supernovae .",
    "to get a better handle on the potential of bar instabilities in core - collapse , we use our collapse models to construct a bar and calculate the gw emission from this bar (  2.3 ) .",
    "we do this calculation by assuming that all of the matter up to some enclosed critical mass becomes unstable and forms a bar ( conserving angular momentum ) , and then calculate the gw emission as a function of total unstable mass ( fig .",
    "note that strains as high as @xmath180 are possible with frequencies as high as a khz ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , one should keep in mind we have assumed that _ all _ of the enclosed mass ends up in the bar .",
    "these estimates are relatively strong upper limits ( although the strain could increase if we allowed the bar to contract and spin up ) .",
    "we illustrate the detectability of waves from bar instabilities in figure [ fig : barmode_15 ] .",
    "each point on this plot illustrates a different possible bar , varying the amount of mass that participates in the instability .",
    "open circles illustrate the wave strain for a single gw cycle ; filled circles give the characteristic strain obtainable if the bar emits coherently for 100 cycles ( see appendix a for further discussion ) .",
    "this plot demonstrates that bar modes are potentially promising sources of waves if bars remain coherent for at least a moderate ( @xmath181@xmath182 ) number of gw cycles .",
    "as the density is centrally peaked , the fragmentation instability is unlikely to occur in core - collapse supernovae . however , if it did occur , the strain would be @xmath183 , at frequencies as high as 2 khz ( table 1 ) .",
    "core - collapse supernovae produce both neutron stars and black holes .",
    "gw emission from young neutron stars produced in core - collapse proceeds similarly to aics .",
    "the major difference is that in core - collapse supernovae a considerable amount of fallback can occur at late times , subsequently spinning up and reheating the young neutron star . generally , lower mass stars produce less fallback , but the fallback material accretes at a higher rate and at earlier times ( fryer et al .",

    "it may be difficult to tell whether a second burst is due to fallback or simply regrowth after dissipation .",
    "as with the aics , we stress that if the neutron star magnetic field is less than @xmath184 g , there will be no observational evidence of the high spin periods until late times . after a year",
    ", the gw emission will have spun the pulsar down to 11ms , which roughly matches pulsar observations ( chernoff & cordes , private communication ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is higher , these fast - spinning pulsars will affect the dynamics of the exploding material .",
    "could this explain the polarization measurements of supernovae ? if this is truly the mechanism which causes supernovae to be polarized , some supernovae should be unpolarized ( e.g. , the progenitor of the relatively low - field crab pulsar ) .    for stars more massive than 25 m",
    "it is likely that a large amount of material will fall back onto the newly - formed neutron star , causing it to collapse to a black hole .",
    "the ringing of this newly formed black hole will produce gw emission (  2.5 ) .",
    "in the most rapid fallback cases , the accretion rate onto the black hole can be as high as 0.01ms@xmath83 ( fryer et al . 1999b ; macfadyen , woosley , & heger 2001 ) .",
    "for our calculations , we assumed that the black hole formed with a mass of 3mand then accreted at a rate of 0.01ms@xmath83 for 500s , holding the spin fixed at @xmath185 for the duration of the accretion process .",
    "for an extremely optimistic estimate of the gw signal from black hole ringing , we assume that the material accretes in 0.5s clumps ( @xmath186s ) , and has a very high radiation efficiency ( @xmath187 ) .",

    "today the imf is peaked toward low mass stars , such that 90% of stellar core - collapse occurs in stars between 8 and @xmath14220 m , and only 1% of core - collapse occurs in stars more massive than 40 m .",
    "however , it has long been believed that the first generation of stars after the big bang tended to be more massive than stars formed today ( e.g. , silk 1983 ; carr & rees 1984 ) .",
    "recent simulations by abel , bryan , & norman ( 2000 ) suggest that the typical mass of first generation stars is @xmath195 m and it could be that a majority of population iii stars had masses in excess of 100 m .",
    "the light from these very massive stars re - ionizes the early universe , and from this we can derive a constraint on the formation rate of these stars .",
    "although we expect that these photons ionized a significant fraction of the early universe , there should not be so many stars that they ionize the universe several times over . using our best estimates of the re - ionization fraction , the amount of ultraviolet photons produced by these massive stars , and the ionization efficiency of massive stars , one estimates that roughly @xmath196 of the baryonic matter in the universe was incorporated into very massive stars ( abel et al .",
    "this corresponds to roughl @xmath197 very massive stars produced in a @xmath198 m galaxy , or a rate of massive stellar collapse as high as one every few thousand years    we should temper these results with two conditions . first , these stars are population iii stars , and so are born at high redshift ( @xmath199 ) . as they evolve to collapse in less than a few million years ( baraffe et al .",
    "2001 ) , they will only be observed at the high redshifts of their birth .",
    "although we might believe our formation rate of very massive stars ( within a few orders of magnitude ) , it is currently impossible to determine how many very massive stars are produced with masses beyond the @xmath200 m mass limit necessary for black hole formation .",
    "the galaxy could produce a million of these objects , or perhaps just a few hundred .",
    "assuming 110 million very massive stars per galaxy beyond @xmath201 gives us a secure upper limit .",
    "the rotation of these stars has again been calculated using the stellar evolution code developed by heger ( 1998 ) , and for this analysis we use the fryer et al .",

    "2 ) .",
    "the proto - black hole formed in the collapse of a massive star is expected to become secularly unstable ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and these secular instabilities are likely to develop before the proto - black hole collapses to a black hole ( fryer et al . 2001 ) . with the large amount of mass ( @xmath202 m ) and angular momentum ( fig .",
    "2 ) , it is not surprising that these objects produce strong gw signals .",
    "however , the cosmological redshift moves the peak of the source waves out of the band of ligo detectors : even at the relatively low value @xmath201 ( luminosity distance @xmath203gpc ) , the strain from bar modes peaks at frequencies less than 10 hz , with a strain @xmath204 .",
    "this is well below the ligo ii threshold .",
    "even coherent integration over @xmath205 cycles is unlikely to produce a detectable signal ; see figs .",
    "6 and 9 .",
    "the waves from massive star collapse may be detectable if a fragmentation instability occurs .",
    "with our crude model of fragmentation , we find that both strain and frequency are boosted if the core splits into two pieces which then fall into a keplerian orbit , conserving angular momentum .",
    "if this instability occurs and the pieces orbit coherently for @xmath206 cycles , these waves may be detectable at redshifts @xmath207 ; see figs .",
    "9 and 10 .",
    "because the proto - black hole collapses before it can cool , the bulk viscosity prevents the growth of r - modes up to collapse .",
    "no gw radiation will occur from r - modes during the collapse of very massive stars .",
    "after the black hole forms out of the inner 1020 m , material rapidly accretes onto it ( fig .",
    "11 ) . like collapsars",
    ", this accretion rate can be very high and produce strong ringing in the newly formed black hole . using the accretion rate and spin evolution from the simulations of fryer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we estimated gw emission from @xmath208 and @xmath97 modes .",
    "we set the radiative efficiency parameter @xmath209 ( moderately optimistic ) and put @xmath210s ( indicating a relatively clumpy flow ) . at @xmath201 , the waves are in ligo s band , but do not achieve strains large enough to guarantee detection : we find that @xmath211 initially ( nearly touching the ligo - ii noise level ) , and that the strain rapidly decreases after that ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : ring ] .",
    "we also illustrate these waves for a collapse at @xmath212 ; they are at even lower frequency and weaker strain .",
    "this figure makes us rather pessimistic about the likelihood of measuring black hole ringing waves from the collapse of very massive stars .",
    "we note , however , that in the case @xmath213 the accumulated signal - to - noise is of order unity .",
    "we have examined gw production under a wide range of stellar collapse scenarios , assuming various mechanisms for gw generation .",
    "our results indicate that some of these waves are likely to be of detectable strength , even though modern models of collapse progenitors predict less angular momentum than they did previously .",
    "the main results of our analysis are as follows .    for the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf ,",
    "the largest potential source of gws during the explosion is likely to be from bar formation .",
    "however , the data used in this analysis indicate that the aic proto - neutron star will not be unstable to bar formation , so we have not considered this mechanism .",
    "( we note , though , that liu & lindblom ( 2001 ) consider white dwarfs with larger angular momentum , and these would certainly be unstable to bar mode formation ; further work will no doubt clarify the effectiveness of such objects for gw production . )",
    "the newly formed remnant is hot enough that it should be unstable to the production of r - mode gws .",
    "the event rate for aics is fairly low ( @xmath214yr@xmath83 per galaxy ) , so one must consider events as far out as 100 mpc . at this distance , both r - mode and bar - mode ( if they occur ) waves are unlikely to be detectable .    for core - collapse supernovae ,",
    "a bar - mode instability is likely to develop shortly after the launch of the supernova shock , similar to the case of aics .",
    "core - collapse supernovae are much more frequent than aics ( @xmath215yr@xmath83 per galaxy ) , so we do not have to look quite so far out ; we consider collapse out to about 10 mpc . for a range of bar formation scenarios ,",
    "we find frequencies and strains that fall above the ligo - ii noise curve .",
    "high signal - to - noise measurements are possible if the bar remains coherent for tens to hundreds of cycles",
    ". the collapse forms a rapidly spinning neutron star , which may be unstable to r - mode emission .",
    "the r - modes can form in the hot remnant itself , or be `` reactivated '' somewhat later when hot material falls back onto the star , reheating it and increasing its spin .",
    "these waves should be detectable by ligo - ii .",
    "very massive progenitors form a black hole instead of a neutron star .",
    "this case produces no r - mode emission , but there will be gws from ringing of the black hole horizon .",
    "however , even with ridiculously optimistic assumptions about the nature of the matter flow onto the hole , we find that these waves are completely undetectable  their strains are very weak , and they are emitted at high frequencies ( @xmath216@xmath217 hz ) where detectors have poor sensitivity .",
    "we also consider the collapse of 300 m stars as a source of gw emission .",
    "although these massive stars may have been quite common in the first generation of stars , it is unlikely that they formed at redshifts below five .",
    "when very massive stars collapse , they pass through a phase where the matter is densely clumped into a proto - black hole .",
    "this rapidly rotating object is susceptible to bar mode instabilities , producing a fairly large gw strain .",
    "however , the gws are unlikely to be detectable because of the large frequency shift due to the cosmological redshift and we find that bar formation at redshift @xmath207 is marginally detectable only if the bar persists for hundreds of cycles .",
    "if the proto - black hole material were to fragment into clumps ( which we model as a binary ) , it could yield a signal detectable by ligo - ii . as the proto - black hole remains extremely hot until collapse",
    ", the bulk viscosity prevents an r - mode instability from developing .",
    "although we believe it is unlikely , it is possible that the ringing of the newly born black hole _ might _ be detectable .",
    "we find that if the star collapses at @xmath218 , the ringing waves are emitted at high enough frequency ( @xmath219@xmath220 hz ) that detector noise may not overwhelm the signal . if the collapse is asymmetric and `` clumpy '' enough to severely distort the hole for several seconds , the ringing waves are likely to be of interesting strength .",
    "we hope that this result will motivate more careful analyses of ringing waves from bhs that are produced in massive stellar collapse ( an example of which is described in papadopoulos & font ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "it is also to be noted that madau & rees ( 2001 ) have recently examined massive black holes as remnants from population iii stars . in their paper they mention the emission of gws from the capture of such holes onto supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies .",
    "such waves are very different from those discussed here , and in fact would be sources for low - frequency space - based detectors such as lisa .",
    "we have not considered this mechanism here .    for all of our estimates",
    "we have made a number of assumptions , chosen to ensure a safe maximum of the gravitational wave signal .",
    "therefore all of our results should be taken as upper limits , and it is certainly possible that the gw signals are weaker than our calculations suggest .",
    "in addition , although based on recent collapse calculations , any estimate of the gravitational wave signal will be limited by the uncertainties in the core - collapse models . however , it is unlikely that our upper limits will change significantly as collapse simulations improve .",

    "we use these results to describe how well the gw strains discussed in this paper can be detected by gw detectors , focusing in particular on the second generation ligo interferometers ( `` ligo - ii '' ) .",
    "one statistic in particular is of great importance to us : the signal power @xmath221 , given by @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the fourier transform of the gravitational waveform @xmath88 , and @xmath224 is the spectral density of strain noise .",
    "one of the most important methods of searching for gws is called `` matched filtering '' .",
    "this method uses a model or template for the waveform to construct a linear filter .",
    "the instrumental data are then correlated with the filter , yielding a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "if a signal in the data stream matches the template , then the snr has a mean value @xmath25 : @xmath225 the signal power is often referred to as the matched filtering snr .",
    "it is simple to prove that this snr is the maximum obtainable with linear filters , so this technique is sometimes called `` optimal filtering '' .",
    "signals are detectable if the matched filtering snr exceeds a threshold , @xmath226 , whose value depends on a large number of parameters ( number of templates in the filter bank , duration of the templates , number of detectors , etc . ) . as a rough rule of thumb , @xmath227 .",
    "further discussion of this point can be found in flanagan & hughes ( 1998 ) , particularly the text near eqs .",
    "( 2.8 ) and  ( 2.9 ) .",
    "because the gws from a particular source depend upon the source s position on the sky , and its orientation , the snr should be averaged over these quantities .",

    "( the equality is exact if the signal is monochromatic . )",
    "the `` mean noise strain '' @xmath237 is @xmath238 the factor of @xmath239 in this equation arises from the detector s sensitivity pattern , which effectively increases the noise for sky averaged sources .",
    "note that the noise spectral density @xmath224 used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hnoise ] ) is the square of the quantity plotted in gustafson et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "the strains @xmath233 and @xmath240 indicate in a simple way the relative strength of the astrophysical gw signal and the noise at a particular frequency .",
    "comparing them is an effective way of quickly estimating the signal power : if @xmath241 , then the signal is likely to be detectable with matched filtering , and hence worth further analysis . in figs",
    ".  5 and 79 we show @xmath233 for the various gw emission scenarios discussed in this paper .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the broad - band ligo - ii noise curve described in @xcite .",

    "ligo - ii is a planned upgrade to the detectors at the two ligo sites .",
    "research and development for various ligo - ii components is in progress , with final implementation set to begin in 2006 or shortly thereafter .",
    "one of ligo - ii s design goals is to have a moderately tunable sensitivity profile ; the broad - band curve we use here is a useful configuration for analyzing the detectability of sources that are not very well understood .",
    "other possible configurations include a curve optimized for detecting binary neutron stars , and a curve with moderately narrow band sensitivity .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion and details .",
    "a second statistic that could easily be computed ( though we do not do so here ) is the time - frequency volume @xmath242 : @xmath243 the quantity @xmath244 is a duration and @xmath245 a bandwidth . for the purpose of estimating the detectability of astrophysical signals , @xmath244 is the duration of the signal and @xmath245 its frequency bandwidth .",

    "this statistic is useful because it helps to understand how well techniques that are not based on matched filtering might perform .",
    "a large value of @xmath242 indicates that the signal power is `` smeared '' over a wide range of frequencies or fourier bins , and that a signal may be difficult to reconstruct without a great deal of prior information .",

    "rather than using a matched filter ( which we do not have enough information to construct ) , data analysis would use a simple band - pass filter .",
    "this filter chops out all power in the datastream at frequencies above @xmath247 and below @xmath248 .",
    "the snr obtained with this filter is the ratio of the signal peak amplitude to the noise peak amplitude in the filtered datastream . following the analysis of flanagan & hughes ( 1998 ) ,",
