    "one of the many interesting and novel features of cold - atomic systems is the presence of a trapping potential . compared to the homogeneous systems , these gases are finite , with a discrete energy spectrum .",
    "it is interesting that experimentalists can create trapping potentials which are both quasi - one- and quasi - two - dimensional , while more recently they have built annular and toroidal potentials .",
    "clearly the reduced effective dimensionality of these systems , as well as the nontrivial topology of annular / toroidal traps introduce novel effects .",
    "quasi - one - dimensional traps have been used in cold atomic systems ever since the first pioneering experiments and have given rise to very interesting effects . already almost 20 years ago",
    "the propagation of sound waves in an elongated bose - einstein condensate was observed and studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "soon after solitary waves were observed in an elongated trap @xcite and in a more oblate one @xcite .",
    "more recently toroidal and annular traps have been built , and even persistent currents have been observed , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it has also become possible to manipulate the shape of the trapping potentials to a very high degree , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite .    under typical conditions",
    "the non - linear gross - pitaevskii equation provides a very accurate description of these systems . in principle",
    "this equation may be solved numerically with use of various techniques , but still the full three - dimensional problem may become rather challenging .",
    "when the trapping potential is very tight along two , or one dimension ( i.e. , the quantum of energy along the corresponding direction is much larger than any other energy scale of the problem ) the motion of the atoms is quasi - one , or quasi - two - dimensional , respectively . in this case",
    "one may make an ansatz for the order parameter , assuming a decoupling of the degrees of freedom along the direction of tight confinement , which are frozen .",
    "integrating over these degrees of freedom one may derive an effectively one- , or two - dimensional equation for the order parameter .",
    "such efforts have been made by numerous authors . given the large numbers of these references we refer just to some representative ones , @xcite .",
    "the benefit from such effective theories is two - fold .",
    "first of all , the corresponding numerical problem is easier to solve .",
    "secondly , especially in the case of quasi - one - dimensional motion , one has a handy equation to work with , which may provide insight into the problem . in addition , one may derive simple expressions for various observables , thus making contact with the well - known corresponding expressions of the homogeneous systems ( i.e. , the one where there is no trapping potential ) .    motivated by the numerous experiments which have been performed in such traps , as well as by the arguments presented above , we consider quite generally a tight , quasi - one - dimensional potential of any geometry and develop an effectively one - dimensional theory .",
    "this is the first main result of the present study .",
    "then , we apply our model to the problem of atoms which rotate in a toroidal trapping potential .",
    "we solve numerically the one - dimensional problem under various approximations , i.e. , the purely one - dimensional problem , the quasi - one - dimensional problem with a fixed transverse width , and the quasi - one - dimensional problem with the transverse width treated variationally .",
    "in addition we solve the full three - dimensional problem numerically , thus making a quantitative comparison of the various models with the exact solution , which is our second main result .    in what follows below we present in sec.ii our quasi - one - dimensional model , while in sec.iii we give approximate and limiting expressions that result from it . in sec.iv",
    "we show the corresponding numerical solutions that result within each approximation , as well as the results of the full three - dimensional problem and compare them .",
    "finally in sec.v we summarize our results and give an overview .",
    "the starting point is the ( time - independent ) gross - pitaevskii equation in three dimensions , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the order parameter , @xmath2 is the atom number , @xmath3 is the trapping potential , @xmath4 is the matrix element for atom - atom collisions , and @xmath5 is the chemical potential ( the mass of the atoms @xmath6 , as well as @xmath7 are set equal to unity , while @xmath1 is normalized to unity ) .",
    "let us now suppose that we want to solve the above three - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation in a narrow tubular neighbourhood of a planar curve @xmath8 .",

    "the above ansatz assumes that the order parameter is independent of the azimuthal variable @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , within this ansatz the functional form of the transverse profile of the cloud is gaussian , however the cloud is allowed to expand radially , rather than having a fixed width , which would be the oscillator length @xmath33 .    in ref.@xcite a closely - related problem has been solved , namely the one where there is no curvature , @xmath34 , making the same ansatz as that of eq.([ansatz ] ) . in the limit of weak interactions",
    "the actual transverse profile is gaussian , while in the thomas - fermi limit the profile is an inverse parabola . here ,",
    "since we want our model to be applicable for any interaction strength we have chosen to work with a gaussian for all interaction strengths , however its width @xmath35 is treated variationally and it is allowed to increase when the interaction is sufficiently strong .",
    "therefore , viewed as a variational approach , the present model is expected to work rather well , as we confirm in secs.iii and iv .",

    "thus , for zero , or weak interactions the two approaches coincide . however , our model is more general and it works better when the interaction becomes comparable to , or larger than , the oscillator quantum of energy @xmath37 , as seen in the evaluation of the speed of sound in sec.iii and in the explicit problem considered in sec.iv .",

    "in addition , it is interesting that one may identify separately the effect of the curvature , of the transverse confinement , and of the interaction .",
    "it is instructive to examine some limiting cases of our model , which also allows us to get some insight .",

    "the width of the cloud thus increases due to the interactions @xcite , since @xmath65 .",

    "this limit is achieved when the interaction energy @xmath99 is much less that @xmath37 . for weak interactions , @xmath100 , and thus @xmath101 .",
    "we stress that this ratio does not depend on @xmath37 , since the density scales as @xmath102 .",

    "the transverse degrees of freedom start to play a role .",
    "we stress that the condition for quasi - one - dimensional motion implies that the interaction energy does not exceed the oscillator quantum of energy in the transverse direction ( an equivalent way of expressing this condition is that the coherence length , which sets the scale of the width of the solitary - wave profiles , is at least on the order of , or larger than the transverse width of the cloud , which is set by the oscillator length . ) still , even in the first case , where we have come closer to breaking the limits of validity of our model , we see in fig.1 that our results are rather accurate .",
    "the coupled three - dimensional equations are solved using the built - in stationary solver in the commercial software comsol multiphysics , version 5.2a .",
    "the domain is set up as a torus with major radius @xmath89 , and minor radius @xmath122 .",
    "this minor radius of the computational domain is deemed sufficiently large to ignore boundary effects .",

    "the exact number of elements differ depending on the size of the domain , determined by the value of @xmath37 .",
    "initial data that is not too far away from the desired solution is needed to find a solution of the nonlinear equations . to overcome this difficulty we take advantage of the one - dimensional solutions and  dress \" them with a gaussian profile in the transverse direction to obtain initial data good enough to find a first solution .",
    "the equations are then solved in sequence of increasing angular momentum , where each solution is provided as initial data for the next run .",
