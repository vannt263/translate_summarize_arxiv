    "this appendix focuses on the following question : how are the volumes of @xmath5 and @xmath434 related ? in general , thurston showed that @xmath435 , so the goal here is to control the increase in volume when we drill out @xmath432 . to be able to do this",
    ", we need more information about the geometry of @xmath5 , so assume in addition we know the length @xmath436 of @xmath432 , and the radius @xmath27 of a maximal embedded open tube about @xmath432 .",

    "since ( [ newest ] ) rests on perelman s announced proof of geometrization @xcite , these results can be viewed as an _ experimental _ check on the correctness of his proof .",
    "there are two obvious caveats here : only a finite number of manifolds were examined , and only part of perelman s work is needed ( namely theorem  [ monotonicity ] in the body of this paper ) . there is a more subtle issue as well : it is entirely possible that for these examples , when one applies the proof of theorem  [ monotonicity ] the ricci flow never goes through any surgeries .",
    "that is , these examples could well avoid one of the least - understood parts of perelman s approach .",
    "after briefly discussing the sample manifolds , i will give various graphical comparisons between ( [ newest ] ) and the data .",
    "i will then turn to an alternate way of explaining the data , namely hyperbolic dehn surgery .",
    "this approach more closely models the data than ( [ newest ] ) , but does not provide universal bounds as ( [ newest ] ) does .",

    "the geometry of selected geodesics were computed using oliver goodman s program _ tube _ , which is distributed with his program _ snap _ @xcite .",
    "the output of the program _ tube _ is not completely rigorous , but should be essentially correct for nearly all of the examples .",
    "most of the geodesics are not too long @xmath452 , and have large tube radii @xmath453 . concentrating on large tube radii was forced because _ tube _ had difficulty with the longer geodesics . however , as you will see , the estimate ( [ newest ] ) is really poor even for modestly small @xmath27 , so this omission is of no real importance .",
    "while most of the geodesics are fairly short , to concentrate on the regime where the two estimates differ noticeably , i did require the geodesics to have length @xmath454 .",

    "partially as a result of having such simple complements , i expect that , in nearly all cases , one can do hyperbolic dehn filling from the drilled manifold to the closed one .",
    "let @xmath449 be as usual .",
    "as per ( [ newest ] ) set @xmath457",
    ". then we have @xmath458 to understand how good a bound @xmath459 is , we consider the overshoot error @xmath460 as a proportion of the actual increase in volume @xmath461 . that is , in figure  [ fig - comp-1 ] we plot @xmath462 against the tube radius @xmath27 .",

    "if we consider different hyperbolic dehn fillings on a fixed cusp manifold , neumann and zagier @xcite showed that @xmath494 as the length @xmath436 of the core geodesic goes to @xmath186 . for a particular dehn filling , bridgeman @xcite observed that as long as @xmath492 is an increasing function of @xmath493 , then ( [ schalfi ] ) implies that the volume increase is bounded by twice the asymptotic estimate : @xmath495 while it appears that bridgeman s inequality does not hold in general ( * ? ? ?",

    "the histogram attached to the right side of the plot gives the distribution of @xmath498 , which is a bell - curve shape with mean @xmath500 ( essentially the @xmath501 expected ! )  and standard deviation @xmath502 .",
    "indeed , the distribution is very nearly the same as the normal distribution with mean @xmath503 and @xmath504 ; the main difference is the top tail is a little thicker than the normal distribution . in all cases , bridgeman s inequality ( [ bridgeman ] ) holds .    while the picture coming from hyperbolic dehn filling provides the most accurate fit for our data",
