    "glassy features in the dynamical behavior of colloidal suspensions are among the most intriguing aspects of their phenomenology",
    ". their idealization as fluids of interacting brownian particles might provide the key to understand glassiness for continuous , finite dimensional systems .",
    "a satisfying analytic treatment seems , however , still out of reach .",
    "+ the evolution of a system of @xmath0 brownian particles can be described either by a system of @xmath0 stochastic ordinary differential equations or , after introducing a density field , by a stochastic partial differential equation @xcite , @xcite which in turn can be recast into a field theory .",
    "a field - theoretic approach is the ideal framework for the study of conservation laws , encoded as symmetries of the action .",
    "the appeal of a field theory is then twofold : the ease to conceive perturbative series expansions in the ( weak ) inter - particle potential , and the possibility to obtain non - perturbative results deriving approximate self - consistent equations for the correlators . in either case",
    ", the symmetries of the action should act as a guidance and a constraint for any approximation scheme .",
    "+ in order to study the glassy dynamics it is necessary to examine a field - theory in its strongly - interacting regime and , to this aim , attempts have been made to re - sum whole classes of diagrams , at all orders in the interaction potential @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle towards a successful resummation scheme is that the time - reversal symmetry of the appropriate action involves non - linear transformations of the fields , relating n - point functions for different n s in an intricate fashion : this precludes the possibility of writing easily - solvable self - consistent closure relations for the n - point functions which respect the symmetry . in general",
    ", a symmetry enforces relations between the field - theoretic correlators ; in particular , the time - reversal symmetry of the field theory we are about to study leads to the correct fluctuation - dissipation relations expected between correlation and linear response functions .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) is a firmly grounded physical requirement for an equilibrated system : solutions violating fdt may arise because of terms which drive the system out of equilibrium , explicitly breaking time - reversal symmetry , or as a consequence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking occurring in glassy phases .",
    "however , any solution describing the _ liquid _ phase would clearly be unsatisfactory if it were incompatible with fdt .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is a thorough study of the brownian gas , which is the @xmath1 order term of any perturbative expansion in the inter - particle potential . here ,",
    "the challenge posed by the non - linear symmetry is isolated from further complications due to the interactions , the origin of the non - linearity being purely entropic .",
    "the material is organized as follows : in section [ partform ] we define the brownian gas and compute exactly the space - time dependence of all the n - point correlation functions for the particle density . in section [ fieldtheo ] we briefly review how to formulate a path - integral description of the system and solve the field theory exactly , re - computing all the n - point correlation functions in agreement with the results of section [ partform ] . calculations with field - theoretic methods are non - trivial since the martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) action describes an interacting field theory , even though the original system contains non - interacting particles . in section [ poiss ]",
    "we emphasize the role of the vertex in enforcing the constraint of a strictly positive density field as opposed to a gaussian free field .",
    "no coarse - graining procedure and no cut - off scale are in principle necessary for a proper definition of the theory .",
    "a central , non - perturbative result is the proof that the statistics of the ground state of the field theory is poissonian . in section [ symm ]",
    "we compute the jacobian of the non - linear field transformation and show explicitly how the n - point functions computed in the previous sections satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem associated to the time - reversal symmetry of the action .",
    "in natural units ( @xmath2 and drag coefficient @xmath3 ) the equation of motion for a brownian particle labeled by @xmath4 moving in @xmath5 is : @xmath6 @xmath7 is a gaussian white noise with probability distribution : @xmath8 and correlators : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 label the vector components .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ langevin ] ) is : @xmath12 note that for any @xmath4 , @xmath13 is a gaussian random variable . +   +",
    "soon we will be interested in the value of @xmath14 , which can be easily computed using : @xmath15 the result in ( [ dcorr1 ] ) is non - vanishing only if @xmath16 s relative to the same particle are considered and finally : @xmath17      the brownian gas consists of @xmath0 brownian particles ( [ langevin ] ) confined in a @xmath18-dimensional box of volume @xmath19 with periodic boundary conditions . as usual , the thermodynamic limit is defined as : @xmath20 the free parameters describing the gas are its average density @xmath21 and its temperature @xmath22 , or equivalently the diffusion coefficient related to the temperature by the einstein relation : @xmath23 . in natural units",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath2 , so that @xmath24 .",
    "the natural length - scale in the system is the average separation between particles , defined as @xmath25 .",
    "also , the well - known relation for diffusive processes @xmath26 fixes the natural time - scale of the system to be @xmath27 .",
    "once distances and time intervals are expressed in these natural units , the brownian gas becomes a parameter - free universal system .",
    "the number density field @xmath28 is defined as :    @xmath29    we now compute the correlation of densities measured at @xmath30 different points in space and time .",
    "the average over initial conditions and realizations of the noise is fully deterministic and represents , at least at equilibrium , the expected outcome of a measurement .",
    "the average over the initial positions @xmath31 and the realizations of the noise @xmath32 are defined in [ defconv ] .",
    "+   + the general structure of the following computations is :    * the position of each particle at time @xmath33 depends both on the initial position and on the realization of the associated noise . using ( [ sol ] ) the two contributions can be separated and the averages over initial positions and noise realizations factorize . * the average over initial conditions is computed using formula ( [ averageip ] ) . * the average over the noise",
    "is performed exploiting the standard relation @xmath34 , valid for any gaussian random variable @xmath35 with probability distribution @xmath36 , and applying ( [ dcorr1 ] ) and ( [ dcorr2 ] ) .",
    "the final result for a generic connected n - point function is surprisingly compact and is reported in formula ( [ npt - part ] ) .",
    "it is a simple exercise to verify that the 1-point function yields @xmath21 , as expected from ( [ thermlimit ] ) . applying the steps described above , for the 2-point function",
    "we obtain :    @xmath37    the connected correlation function is : @xmath38    in the continuum limit another factor of @xmath19 appears in the numerator of the first term @xmath39 which is then finite in the thermodynamic limit whereas the second term vanishes , being suppressed by a factor @xmath40 . in the thermodynamic limit the 2-point function is thus : @xmath41      the computation of the 3-point function gives some further useful insight .",
    "the generalization to an n - point function is then straightforward .",
    "@xmath42 each term in the calculation above is associated to a connected or a disconnected correlation ; connected pieces represent single - particle self - correlations to which a formal `` conservation of momentum '' rule is associated by formula ( [ averageip ] ) .",
    "again , the subtraction of disconnected pieces removes , in the thermodynamic limit , all the terms except for the first one , which is the only fully connected term .",
    "a connected n - point correlation functions can then be written in the thermodynamic limit as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 . after computing the average over the noise , the general n - point correlation function",
    "is easily obtained : @xmath45 note that @xmath46 in ( [ eqc ] ) allows to perform easily one of the sums over @xmath47 and the other @xmath48 summations give , in the continuum approximation , a factor @xmath49 as in ( [ contlim ] ) .",
    "hence the whole expression is proportional to @xmath21 and it is finite in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath50 with the constraint @xmath51 in the last exponential .",
    "the space and time - translation invariance of the result are manifest .",
    "+   + as we have seen , the only finite contributions in the thermodynamic limit come from single - particle self - correlations .",
    "the particles positions @xmath52 obey the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) and the solutions are gaussian random variables for which all the connected moments @xmath53 vanish if @xmath54 .",
    "it could be somewhat surprising to find non - vanishing connected moments of the density for every @xmath30 .",
    "the key point is that the density field ( [ densfield ] ) is a _ function _ of the particle positions and a generic function of gaussian random variables does not have to be , and in this case is not , gaussianly distributed .",
    "we now briefly review how to introduce a single differential equation with all the information content of the system of langevin equations describing the brownian gas , and how to rephrase it as a field theory .",
    "the brownian dynamics of a system of particles can be encoded in a stochastic ordinary differential equation for each particle ; since we consider the non - interacting case only , the equations are naturally decoupled : @xmath55 defining the density field as in ( [ densfield ] ) , the system of equations can be formally translated into dean s equation ( [ dean - eq ] ) , which is the corresponding partial differential equation governing the evolution of the density field : @xmath56 in the process , the @xmath0 independent noises @xmath57 have been turned into a single vector field @xmath58 with self - correlation : @xmath59 since in ( [ dean - eq ] ) the noise multiplies the density field , the differential equation becomes a meaningful string of symbols only once a proper interpretation for the noise term is given @xcite .",
    "we adopt the it prescription , which implies a trivial jacobian @xcite for the path - integral in ( [ genfunc ] ) . +   +",
    "it should be stressed that , due to the singular nature of the density field , the natural setting of dean s equation is a distribution space . in such a setting the equation has been derived exactly , without any coarse - graining assumptions or cut - off scales which are by no means necessary to obtain the differential equation @xcite .        through",
    "a formal procedure first devised by janssen @xcite following martin , siggia and rose ( msr ) @xcite , a stochastic differential equation can be recast into a field theory defined by a functional integral .",
    "the basic idea is to impose the original equation of motion for the density field @xmath60 by introducing a new field @xmath61 as lagrange multiplier , whereas the noise is integrated out exploiting its gaussian measure .",
    "+   + after introducing for convenience a shifted density field with a vanishing average , @xmath62 the analytic expression of the msr generating functional is : @xmath63 with action : @xmath64 + t\\rho_0 [ \\nabla i\\hat{\\phi}]^2 + t\\rho[\\nabla i\\hat{\\phi}]^2 \\big\\}\\ ] ] the time integration in ( [ action ] ) extends from @xmath65 to @xmath66 or , equivalently , the initial conditions are shifted to the infinite past : due to the dissipative dynamics , the ground - state of the theory describes then the equilibrated system , forgetful of any initial condition .",
    "we do not specify instead the functional domain over which the path integrals in ( [ genfunc ] ) are computed and proceed formally : the functional integrals are regarded as formal series of gaussian integrals computed over unconstrained ( i.e.  positive and negative ) fields whereas , in principle , the integral over @xmath60 should be restricted to sums of @xmath67 s only , as the form of the density field in ( [ densfield ] ) would suggest .",
    "the exact match of the results we will obtain with the ones calculated in the particle formalism justifies _ a posteriori _ such an approach , emphasizing the role of the auxiliary field @xmath61 and of the vertex in imposing the equation of motion ( [ dean - eq ] ) and enforcing the positivity of the density field .      for the following analysis it will be convenient to work in a representation involving times @xmath33 and momenta @xmath47 . introducing the time - ordering convention to write earlier fields to the right of later fields , the appropriate feynman rules are then : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the dotted edges on the vertex indicate the action of spatial derivatives .",
    "all the momenta are considered positive when incoming in the vertex .",
    "+   + the propagator @xmath68 is the density - density correlator and we will refer to the propagators @xmath69 and @xmath70 as the advanced and retarded response functions respectively .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that such terminology would be appropriate only in the case of langevin equations with additive noise , for which the occurrence of @xmath61 in a field - theoretic expectation value can be proven to represent the linear response to the variation of a chemical potential @xmath71 coupled to the density field . for the msr field theory associated to dean s equation , instead",
    ", response functions are characterized not by @xmath61 but by the composite operator @xmath72 as we will show in section [ symm1 ] . yet , for simplicity , in the following we will refer to the pseudo - response functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 as `` response functions '' _ tout court_.      although corresponding to a non - interacting particle system , the action ( [ action ] ) has a vertex and the field theory is non - gaussian .",
    "the study of the gas is nevertheless easier than the interacting case since all loop diagrams vanish because of causality , as the following example , easily generalizable to arbitrary n - point functions , illustrates : +        ( 0,0 ) ( -23,48)@xmath73 ( -47,17)@xmath74 ( -8,8)@xmath75    labeling @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 the vertices of the triangle , the @xmath76-functions in the propagators impose : @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "such constraints can be satisfied only by @xmath80 , with a vanishing volume in phase space .",
    "hence , only tree diagrams yield non - vanishing amplitudes and such a simplification which will allow to compute exactly all the correlation functions .",
    "+   + the structure of the vertex implies that among the edges of a tree there is one and only one correlation - like propagator , all the other propagators being response - like .",
    "the identity below allows to express a correlation - like propagator as a sum of two response - like propagators : @xmath81 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\rho_0   \\big [ \\langle \\rho i\\hat{\\phi } \\rangle(k , t ) + \\langle i\\hat{\\phi } \\rho \\rangle ( k , t ) \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] graphically : @xmath82{feyn1.eps } \\ ; \\rightarrow \\ ; \\rho_0 ( \\ ; \\includegraphics[width=0.07\\textwidth]{feyn3.eps } \\ ; + \\ ; \\includegraphics[width=0.07\\textwidth]{feyn2.eps } \\ ; ) $ ] .",
    "+ using relation ( [ prop - dec ] ) , each diagram can be decomposed into the sum of two simpler diagrams in which all the propagators are response - like : causality , encoded through the @xmath83 functions in the feynman rules , endows the response - like propagators with a natural orientation so that the concept of `` earlier vertex '' is well - defined .",
    "the above decomposition leads also to the appearance of vertices with three dashed legs whose properties are discussed in section [ c - diag ] +   + after applying the decomposition ( [ prop - dec ] ) the diagrams contributing to a correlation function can be divided into two subsets :    * c - diagrams : all the external lines are solid lines or , equivalently , one of the vertices has three dashed legs . * r - diagrams :",
    "one of the external lines is a dashed line or , equivalently , all the vertices are of the kind depicted in the feynman rules of section [ feynrules ] .",

    "the temperature will be set to one in the following ( @xmath86 ) an it will be easily reintroduced in the final result ( [ grand ] ) .",
    "r - diagrams can be immediately mapped to binary rooted trees by considering the propagator with the external dashed line as the root of the tree . before confronting the general case it is instructive to compute explicitly the first few r - diagrams to better understand and appreciate the combinatorial approach developed in section [ comb ] .",

    "then , the argument above leading to the graph cancellations does not apply .",
    "* theorem : * _ in the sum over topologically inequivalent ( ti ) labelings , c - graphs completely cancel r - graphs without a stalk . _ +   + examples of r - graphs without a stalk and c - graphs appear in the second and third line of ( [ groups ] ) respectively .",
    "+ let us consider an @xmath302 point function .",
    "r - graphs without a stalk have @xmath30 leaves and c - graphs have @xmath302 leaves .",
    "it is useful to note that for r - graphs the label ` 1 ' is constrained by causality to appear on the upper vertex ( root ) , as a consequence of the contraction of the stalk . for c - graphs , instead",
    ", the c - vertex itself is always labeled by ` 1 ' ( ` 1 ' being the smallest among all the descendant labels ) , another label ` 1 ' has to be placed on some leaf , and because of this some edges need to be contracted according to the rules discussed in section [ graphrule ] .",
    "the key idea of the proof is that for an r - graph the number of edges dangling from the root is independent of the labeling , whereas for c - graphs edge contractions cause this number to vary .",
    "+ let us consider an r - graph @xmath130 whose root has @xmath134 dangling lines with the associated combinatorial factor @xmath303 .",
    "it is possible that particular labelings of some c - graphs @xmath304 which initially have @xmath305 dangling lines produce @xmath130 after operating the contractions induced by the labelings .",
    "those graphs will be multiplied by the generalized stirling numbers @xmath306 . in particular",
    ", we can construct all the graphs @xmath304 starting from a c - vertex with @xmath242 dangling lines and `` pulling down '' groups of edges with the constraints that a c - vertex must have at least three dangling lines and that ` 1 ' labels one of the lowest leaves in such a way to induce a contraction leading back to a root with @xmath134 dangling lines .",
    "+ an example should make things clear .",

    "as explained above , ` 1 ' labels one of the lowest leaves .",
    "the coefficient in front of each graph is made up of : a sign which keeps track of the number of contracted edges ; the generalized stirling number associated to the c - vertex ; the product of coefficients associated to the underlying r - vertices ; the number of labelings which leave ` 1 ' to label one of the lowest leaves .",

    "<S> as a first step towards a successful field theory of brownian particles in interaction , we study exactly the non - interacting case , its combinatorics and its non - linear time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> even though the particles do not interact , the field theory contains an interaction term : the vertex is the hallmark of the original particle nature of the gas and it enforces the constraint of a strictly positive density field , as opposed to a gaussian free field . </S>",
    "<S> we compute exactly all the n - point density correlation functions , determine non - perturbatively the poissonian nature of the ground state and emphasize the futility of any coarse - graining assumption for the derivation of the field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we finally verify explicitly , on the n - point functions , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem implied by the time - reversal symmetry of the action . </S>"
