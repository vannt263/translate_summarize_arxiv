    "in the past years , the chromosphere and its magnetic structure has been found to be a key ingredient to progress in understanding the solar corona . yet ,",
    "little is known of the properties of the chromosphere on small scales .",
    "recent high - resolution observations suggest that in the quiet sun there exists a weak - field domain below the classical `` canopy '' @xcite .",
    "the prominent magnetic fields of the `` canopy '' are major constituents of the chromosphere in the stricter sense as it is seen in the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the weak - field domain below is referred to as `` fluctosphere '' hereafter  a term coined by @xcite .",
    "the fluctosphere in numerical lte radiation hd models is generated by the interaction of ( acoustic ) shock waves , which are excited in the photosphere and propagate upwards into the layer above . at a height range in the fluctosphere around 1000 km above @xmath1",
    "this results in an apparent temperature pattern that has similarity to reversed granulation , yet changes with typical timescales between 2030s @xcite .",
    "synthetic spectra from numerical simulations @xcite allows us to directly compare the models with observations of this layer in order to study its morphology and dynamics .    as very little",
    "is known about the fluctospheric magnetic fields , we present and interpret for the first time high spatially resolved spectro - polarimetric measurements in the fluctosphere above strong photospheric magnetic features .",
    "we observed a quiet sun region located in a coronal hole near disc center on may 26 , 2007 using the ca ii infrared line at 854.2 nm .",
    "the observations were carried out in coordination with hinode to simultaneously obtain g - band images .",
    "several persistant g - band bright points are visible in the field of view , forming a network element .",
    "the ibis instrument consists of two channels , a narrowband channel with two tunable fabry - perot interferometers and a broadband channel for reference @xcite .",
    "the broadband images of ibis were calibrated with the standard procedure of dark subtraction and gain table application and reconstructed using the speckle image reconstruction algorithm modified for high - order adaptive optics corrected data detailed in @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed broadband images were used to destretch the narrowband images of ibis .",
    "finally , the hinode g - band images were aligned to the broadband reconstructions .",
    "the ibis narrowband channel was set up in spectro - polarimetric mode to scan the line core of the ca ii line in 2 dimensions using six modulation states and an exposure time of 35ms .",
    "the line was scanned with 17 wavelength steps using a step width in wavelength corresponding to 4.3pm with a full width at half maximum transmission of 4.6pm .",
    "this procedure resulted in a overall cadence of approximately 27s over the 26.5 minutes observation sequence .",
    "a subregion of the data set displayed for the ca ii infrared line core is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr]a for a small part of the time sequence .    arcs ( black solid : stokes v / i ; dashed : stokes u / i ; dotted : stokes",

    "* a ) properties of the intensity pattern in inter - network regions * + in our analysis , we have measured the typical time scales with which the two - dimensional structures measured at different positions in the ca ii infrared line evolve . using the two - dimensional auto - correlation function ,",
    "the @xmath3 time scale was computed for continuum , line wing and line core of the ca ii infrared line in weak - field regions .",
    "we obtain similar results as in @xcite and @xcite , who used the ca ii h and k lines , respectively , with a correlation time of 176 seconds for granulation , about 152 seconds for reversed granulation and 59 seconds for the pattern in the fluctosphere ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : corr ]  b ) ) . nevertheless , in comparison to the results of these works , the spectral bandwidth of the presented observations is narrower by an order of magnitude , which has implications on the height origin of the specific intensity .",
    "models of the ca ii infrared contribution function predict significant contributions from photospheric layers when observing with broad filters @xcite , demanding the narrowest possible filters to attribute measured intensity to the fluctosphere and chromosphere .",
    "the observed data indicate the existence of a two - dimensional pattern originating from heights around 1000 - 1500 km that evolves faster than e.g. reversed granulation .",
    "this pattern is likely the intensity signature of the temperature pattern seen in the radiation hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite .    *",
    "b ) topology of the magnetic network elements * + we have analyzed the field structure of strong magnetic features extending from photosphere to fluctosphere by averaging the total linear and circular polarization signals over the time sequence , as the signal - to - noise ratio was insufficient for an analysis of single scans .",
    "the result of this averaging is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag]a  d . the observations , acquired in a coronal hole region , show a distinct signal in the total circular polarization signal with a diameter of 1arcs at the locations of the magnetic features in the photosphere which are best seen in g - band images .",
    "these features remain at the same location for the duration of the observation and  while their movement is dominated by the convective motion  do not travel over long distances .",
    "thus , in the averaged g - band images the location of the magnetic features are clearly visible ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mag]a ) .",
    "the temporal averaging also reveals a ring in total linear polarization with a radius of 7.6arcs , possibly indicating a funnel - like structure in the fluctospheric layers .",
    "we intend to analyze the temporal behavior of the magnetic fields in the fluctosphere in the future .",
    "the stokes parameters averaged over the time sequence are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag]e . when compared to a nlte model of the ca ii infrared line at 854.2 nm ( rhsc3d , *",
    "* ) , assumed for disk center geometry , the observed stokes  v / i signal compares well to a signal generated by a magnetic field strength of 50gauss .",
    "we present spectro - polarimetric observations of the solar atmosphere in a coronal hole with focus on the fluctosphere .",
    "we find that ( a ) inter - network regions in the fluctosphere display an intensity pattern that shows structures of similar spatial scales as reversed granulation , yet is evolving on much faster time scales .",
    "we interpret this pattern as the intensity signature of propagating , interacting shock waves as predicted by three - dimensional lte radiation hydrodynamic models of the fluctosphere .",
    "( b ) the strong magnetic features visible in our observations possibly form a funnel - like structure in the fluctosphere that is likely extending into the chromosphere .",
    "the stokes v / i signal in the strongest magnetic feature visible compares well to a signal created by a field strength of 50gauss in nlte simulations ( rhsc3d , * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of the magnetic fields in the fluctosphere and chromosphere are important when trying to gather a deeper understanding of the chromospheric energy balance .",
    "as the magnetic structures in these layers are likely to be small , ultimately telescopes with larger apertures are needed .",
    "the difficulties of the observation of weak magnetic fields in the fluctosphere and chromosphere are only surpassed by the interpretation of such data .",
    "in general , the height origins of the stokes signals are unclear and do not only depend on contribution function but also on the height distribution of the magnetic field strength .",
