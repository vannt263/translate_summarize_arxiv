    "massive stars are expected to play an important role in the interstellar dust budget in young dwarf galaxies as well as in galaxies in the early universe because of their relatively short evolution lifetime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , several eruptive objects with intermediate maximum absolute luminosities between classical nova eruptions and supernova ( sn ) explosions have been discovered .",
    "they are termed as sn impostors @xcite and suggested to be a super - outburst of a luminous blue variable ( lbv)-like event rather than a complete disruption of the progenitor .",
    "sn impostors provide us with useful opportunities to investigate the effect of an eruptive outburst on the yield of circumstellar dust around the evolved massive stars before core collapse @xcite . among sn impostors ,",
    "sn 2008s in ngc 6946 @xcite and the optical transient in ngc 300 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ngc300-ot ) are peculiar ones .",
    "one of the outstanding characteristics of them is that their progenitors are deeply embedded in circumstellar dust shells .",
    "@xcite carried out a systematic mid - infrared photometric search for candidate objects which are analogous to the progenitors of sn 2008s and ngc300-ot in four nearby galaxies m33 , ngc 300 , m 81 , and ngc 6946 with _",
    "they found dozens of extreme asymptotic giant branch ( eagb ) objects similar to sn 2008s and ngc300-ot progenitors , but none of them are brighter than the ngc300-ot progenitor and redder than the sn 2008s progenitor .",
    "they point out that the rarity of such extremely red and luminous progenitors can be interpreted as the short duration of the dust - obscured phase with rapid mass loss rates prior to some kind of explosion event in the evolution of massive stars @xcite .",
    "ngc300-ot was discovered on 2008 may 14 in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc300 @xcite , the distance of which is @xmath12 .",
    "ngc300-ot has shown an intermediate peak absolute magnitude of @xmath13 with an optical spectrum well reproduced by an f - type supergiant photosphere with emission lines of hydrogen , , and [ ] , similar to typical spectra of low - luminosity sn imposters @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of ngc300-ot was not detected in _",
    "hubble space telescope_(_hst _ ) archive images @xcite , but was identified in _ spitzer _",
    "archival images @xcite , which suggest the dust - enshrouded nature of the progenitor .",
    "several interpretations have been proposed for the nature of ngc300-ot : a heavily dust - enshrouded oh / ir star of @xmath14@xmath15 @xcite , a dust enshrouded star with a luminosity of about @xmath16 indicative of a @xmath14@xmath17@xcite , or a massive ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) carbon - rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star or a post - agb star @xcite .",
    "the validity of those mass ranges is confirmed by @xcite based on the method that derives the star formation history of a transient s host stellar population .",
    "@xcite also pointed out the presence of newly formed dust of @xmath20 in addition to the pre - existing circumstellar dust of @xmath21 of @xmath22 based on the near- to mid - infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at 93 days after the discovery .",
    "further near - infrared ( nir ) observations at later epochs are crucial to investigate the properties of newly - formed dust grains at the outburst .    in this paper",
    ", we present our results of nir observations of ngc300-ot on the 398th and the 582nd days with the infrared camera(irc ) onboard akari @xcite .",

    "n__2(@xmath23 ) , _ _",
    "n__3(@xmath24 ) and _ _ n__4(@xmath25 ) were carried out with the irc .",
    "we focus on the time evolution of the emission from newly formed dust and investigate the dust formation process around ngc300-ot during its eruptive outburst .",
    "the first epoch datasets were obtained on 2009 june 16 corresponding to the epoch of 398 days after the discovery as part of the director s time ( dt ) .",
    "they consist of imaging observations in three filter bands centered at @xmath26 ( _ _ n__2 ) , @xmath27 ( _ _ n__3 ) , and @xmath28 ( _ _ n__4 ) @xcite of the pointing i d 5200806.1 and 5200806.2 , and spectroscopic observations with the nir prism ( np ; @xmath29 ) for @xmath2@xmath30 @xcite of the pointing i d 5200805.1 and 5200807.1 .",
    "the second - epoch data sets were obtained on 2009 december 17 corresponding to the epoch of 582 days after the discovery as part of the mission program ( mp ) `` interstellar medium in our galaxy and nearby galaxies '' ( ismgn ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they include imaging observations in _ _",
    "n__3 , and _ _ n__4 bands ( pointing i d 1422250.1 and 1422250.2 ) and spectroscopic observations with the nir grism ( ng ; @xmath31 ) for @xmath32@xmath30 @xcite ( pointing i d 1422249.1 and 1422249.2 ) .",
    "the imaging data were reduced with the akari / irc imaging toolkit for phase 3 data version 20081015and the flux was measured with command in the package of .",
    "the spectroscopic data were reduced with the akari / irc spectroscopy toolkit for phase 3 data version 20090211 .",
    "the near infrared spectra of ngc300-ot were taken in the slitless spectroscopy mode .",
    "therefore , they are blended with the spectra of diffuse emission from the host galaxy ngc 300 .",
    "we carefully subtracted the contribution of diffuse emission from ngc 300 by interpolating the signals around ngc300-ot .",
    "the value of a bad pixel was replaced by the median value of the adjoining pixels .",
    "the ng spectrum at 582 days was smoothed by a @xmath33 pixel running mean to increase the signal - to - noise ratio without degrading the spectral resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : nirspectrum ] shows the obtained nir spectra of ngc300-ot at @xmath0 and @xmath1 days .",
    "no significant contribution is recognized from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features around @xmath34 , hydrogen recombination lines of brackett @xmath35 at @xmath36 , and brackett @xmath37 at @xmath38 , nor forbidden lines from ionized gas ( e.g. [ ] at @xmath39 , [ ] at @xmath40 and [ ] at @xmath41 ) in the spectra .",
    "therefore , the nir spectra of ngc300-ot at both epochs are dominated by hot dust continuum emission .",
    "the results of the photometry are listed in table [ tab : sedofngc300ot ] . @xcite",
    "have reported that the @xmath42 flux at @xmath43 days is @xmath44 , which is in agreement with our results at @xmath1 days .",
    "compared to the fluxes at @xmath0 days , the fluxes at @xmath1 days had declined by 56% in the _ _",
    "n__2 , 35% in the _ _ n__3 and , 15% in the _ _ n__4 bands .",
    "since the noise level in the spectroscopic mode at @xmath36 is about @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and the estimated spectral resolution is @xmath47 for np and @xmath48 for ng , an upper limit of the intensity of brackett @xmath35 , which is expected to be the strongest among the hydrogen recombination lines in @xmath2@xmath30 , is estimated as @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 days , respectively .",
    "thus , the contribution of brackett @xmath35 on the _ _ n__4 band is supposed to be negligible .",
    ".photometric data of ngc300-ot[tab : sedofngc300ot ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "according to @xcite , the sed of ngc300-ot at @xmath51 days is well explained by three blackbody components of temperatures of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the component of @xmath52 is assumed to come from the photosphere .",
    "the component of @xmath54 ( hereafter , the warm dust ) is attributed to the dust produced in the agb / post - agb phase . while the origin of the component of @xmath53 ( hereafter , the hot dust ) remains to be identified , it is most likely to be attributable to the newly formed dust in the outburst ejecta @xcite .",
    "if these grains are heated by the radiation from the central star and are in radiative equilibrium , the temperature of the dust should follow the relation of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the dust temperature and @xmath57 is the luminosity of the central star . according to the light curve by @xcite , the luminosity of ngc300-ot in the _",
    "v_-band had fallen by about @xmath58 from @xmath51 to @xmath59 days .",
    "the dust temperatures at @xmath59 days should be about a half of that at @xmath51 days , or the warm dust temperature at @xmath59 days should be @xmath60 .",
    "we estimate that the contribution to the nir emission from the warm dust decreases from that at @xmath61 days and should be at most 1% of the observed flux at @xmath0 days , which is lower than the uncertainties in the photometry .",
    "thus , we can attribute the observed change of the sed entirely to the hot dust , which comes from dust grains that were formed in the ejecta .      to investigate the change in the properties of the dust",
    ", we assume a simple model of an isothermal dust cloud and fit the sed derived from the nir imaging data by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the dust optical depth , and @xmath64 is the planck function .",
    "we assume that @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "we derive dust temperatures for both optically thin ( @xmath66 ) and thick ( @xmath67 ) case .",
    "the dust temperatures and the total luminosities are listed in table [ tab : sedresult ] .",
    "based on this simple model , the dust emitting radius @xmath68 can be given by @xmath69^{\\onehalf},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the distance to ngc300-ot from the observer and @xmath71 is the observed flux . in figure",
    "[ fig : relopa ] , @xmath68 is plotted against @xmath63 at @xmath26 . according to @xcite , an upper limit of the expansion velocity of the ejecta is about @xmath72 .",
    "if the ejecta expands with this velocity , @xmath68 must be smaller than @xmath73 ( the dashed line in figure [ fig : relopa ] ) at @xmath0 days and then @xmath74 ( the dot - dashed line ) at @xmath1 days . assuming that the dust mass did not change between @xmath0 and @xmath1 days , the dust opacity should be proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "if the dust cloud expands at a constant velocity , the ratio of the radius at @xmath1 days to that at @xmath0 days must be equal to @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath63 @xmath68 line at @xmath0 days is predicted to evolve to the gray shaded region in figure [ fig : relopa ] .",
    "only the region where the predicted line overlaps with the observed line at @xmath1 days gives consistent models both at 398 and 582 days . from figure",
    "[ fig : relopa ] , a lower limit of @xmath63 ( @xmath26 ) is estimated to be @xmath77 at @xmath0 days and @xmath78 at @xmath1 days .",
    "therefore , the dust cloud around ngc300-ot is optically thick at both epochs .",
    "it is consistent with the featureless spectra shown in figure [ fig : nirspectrum ] . assuming the constant density",
    ", we can estimate a lower limit of the dust mass as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the dust mass absorption coefficient at @xmath26 .",
    "the absorption coefficient @xmath80 is estimated as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the mass density of the dust grains , @xmath83 , assuming carbon dust @xcite . in case",
    "that the density varies as @xmath84 , we need to assume the inner shell radius for the dust mass estimation .",
    "if the inner shell radius is within a half or a quarter of @xmath68 , the estimated dust mass will not change more than @xmath85 of that in the constant density case .",
    "lcc & & +     + @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 + @xmath89 & @xmath90 & @xmath91 +     + @xmath86 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 + @xmath89 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 +    if the dust cloud is optically thick , there must be a temperature gradient .",
    "thus an isothermal model is a crude approximation , particularly for the optically thick case .",
    "to examine how secure the conclusion of the optically thick emission is , we consider an optically - thin cloud in some more detail .",
    "the total dust mass can be estimated for an optically thin case using equation ( 4 ) in @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the total dust luminosity in @xmath98 .",
    "using the temperature and the luminosity in table [ tab : sedresult ] for @xmath99 , we obtain @xmath100 at @xmath0 days and @xmath101 at @xmath1 days .",
    "thus , if the emission is optically thin , the dust mass must be increased by a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "theoretical investigations suggest that the nucleation and grain growth will cease in a relatively short time right after the onset of nucleation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that optically thin models can not account for the observations .    since the ratio of the opacity at the _ v_-band to that at @xmath11 is about @xmath103 , the optically - thick dust cloud predicts strong extinction at visible wavelengths . @xcite reported @xmath104 at @xmath105 days , which suggests that the extinction by the dust cloud is very small or negligible .",
    "@xcite reported that the _ r_-band magnitude has significantly faded to @xmath106 at @xmath107 days and they surmise that ngc300-ot is likely becoming self - enshrouded .",
    "an upper limit of the extinction at the _ r_-band at @xmath107 days can be estimated as @xmath108 , if we simply assume the _",
    "r_-band magnitude at @xmath107 days is the same as that at @xmath109 days .",
    "although it may be true that part of the stellar radiation is attenuated , it is too small to account for the extinction caused by the optically thick dust cloud , more than @xmath110 , in the preceding discussion .",
    "the apparent contradiction suggests that the dust around ngc300-ot is distributed not uniformly , but in spherically asymmetrical geometry , such as a torus , bipolar , or clumpy form , so that the dust cloud does not completely screen the radiation from the ejecta gas and the central star .",
    "the existence of a significantly asymmetrical dust cloud was also proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the present results also support the existence of an asymmetrical dust cloud .",
    "we present the results of the nir observations on ngc300-ot at @xmath0 and @xmath1 days after the discovery with the irc onboard akari .",
    "nir spectra ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) are obtained for the first time .",
    "they show no prominent emission or absorption features but are dominated by continuum radiation of the dust around ngc300-ot .",
    "nir photometric data were taken in _ _",
    "n__3 , and _ _ n__4 bands .",
    "the sed of ngc300-ot indicates a dust temperature of @xmath7 at @xmath0 days and @xmath8 at @xmath1 days .",
    "we estimate the dust optical depth as @xmath9 on day @xmath0 and @xmath10 on day @xmath1 , assuming an isothermal dust cloud .",
    "although the present model is very crude , optically thin models can not account for the observations at day 398 and 582 consistently .",
    "the large optical depths at nir suggest a large extinction at visible wavelengths , while little extinction is reported based on earlier observations ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "those circumstances suggest that the dust cloud around ngc300-ot should be distributed asymmetrically so as to not screen the radiation from the ejecta gas and the central star .",
    "the present results suggest that the dust formation occurs in ngc300-ot in the form of a torus , a bipolar outflow , or clumpy cloudlets .",
    "this work is based on observation of akari , a jaxa project with the participation of esa .",
    "we thank all the members of the akari project , particularly those who have engaged in the observation planning and the satellite operation during the performance verification phase , for their continuous help and support .",
