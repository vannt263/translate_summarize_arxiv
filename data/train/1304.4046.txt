    "the josephson junction is described by two ratios : the ratio of the characteristic energies , the josephson energy ( @xmath3 ) and the charging energy ( @xmath4 ) , and the ratio of the effective damping resistance ( @xmath5 ) and the quantum resistance ( @xmath6 ) . depending on these ratios , either the charge or the phase behaves as a classical variable .",

    "the jj chain forms a high impedance transmission line @xcite for the josephson plasmon mode @xcite and when this impedance exceeds the quantum resistance @xmath9 , coherent quantum phase slips @xcite give rise to a coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunneling @xcite .",

    "the simulated dc iv curve of the sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) and the details of the simulations will be given below .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the simulation parameters were either experimentally measured or estimated from sample geometry .",
    "we find qualitative agreement between the simulation and experiment and by adjusting only the critical current @xmath19 , it is possible to get quantitative agreement between experimental and simulated dc iv curves .",
    "we therefore conclude that the circuit model accurately simulates the phase - dynamics of the josephson junction chains .    in order to gain insight into the complex dynamics of the josephson junction chains , we appeal to the analogy with a simpler and more well - studied resistively capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model @xcite . in normalized units",
    "this model gives the current as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the phase difference over the junction .",
    "the damping in this model is due to a frequency - independent ohmic shunt resistance , @xmath44 , and it is expressed in terms of a dimensionless quality factor @xmath45 .",
    "this quality factor is sometimes called the stewart - mccumber damping parameter @xmath46 .",
    "a very well known mechanical analog for the rscj model is a particle in a tilted washboard potential . in the mechanical model",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to friction and hence small @xmath48 represents large damping .",
    "this model has two distinct states , one is the particle resting at the potential minimum ( 0-state ) corresponding to the s.c .",
    "branch and the other state is the particle running down the washboard potential ( 1-state ) corresponding to the dissipative branch .",
    "a graphical way to visualize the dynamics of a josephson junction is a phase - space diagram .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows the phase - space diagram of a josephson junction with underdamped dynamics biased below the critical current ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "two basins of attraction are separated by the red lines .",
    "a particle escaping from the 0-state through the saddle point ( green dot , indicating the local maximum of the tilted washboard potential ) can not move directly to the basin of the next 0-state attractor without entering the basin of 1-state attractor . for fluctuation - free dynamics ,",
    "once the particle is at the 1-state it will continue to run down the washboard potential .",
    "fluctuations , which necessarily accompany the damping , give rise to transitions between the two stable attractors , known as escape and retrapping . the energy required to switch the system from 1-state to 0-state is called _ activation  energy _ and it is approximately equal to the kinetic energy of the particle in the 1-state . the kinetic energy decreases with increasing damping . therefore unstable switching between the 0-state and 1-state require large thermal energy and/or large damping . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in a certain range of parameters , the rcsj model with noise current predicts that both of these states can be unstable and junction can switch rapidly back and forth between running and resting states , creating a constant current branch on dc iv curve .",
    "while these simulations were performed on a single junction with linear damping , we propose that this type of instability leads to a voltage - bias independent current due to a continuous phase - slipping and phase - sticking in josephson junction chains .",
    "the dynamics of a josephson junction chain is far more complex than that of the simple rcsj model . in the chain",
    ", collective modes can exist and the damping is far more complicated than a simple ohmic resistor . to address this we performed simulations of long chains , modeled using the circuit diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) .",
    "each junction of the squids in the chain is modeled as an ideal josephson junction shunted by a capacitance @xmath51 and a nonlinear resistor @xmath44 , which only lets current through when the voltage across it exceeds the gap voltage @xmath52 .",
    "the total current through junction @xmath53 is thus @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter at the island to the left of junction @xmath53 , and @xmath56 is the voltage .",
    "the nonlinear resistive current is taken to be @xmath57 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) , where @xmath44 is the normal resistance of a single junction .",
    "( the sub - gap resistance is thus assumed to be infinite . ) in addition a thermal noise current @xmath58 is included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlinear ] ) .",
    "the latter is modeled as a gaussian random johnson - nyquist noise with zero mean and covariance @xmath59 . experimentally , the josephson junction chain is voltage biased .",
    "therefore , the currents entering the chain from the left through the left lead resistance and leaving the chain on the right are given by @xmath60 the johnson - nyquist noise @xmath61 in the terminal resistors have zero mean and obey @xmath62 .",
    "these terminal resistances consists of lead resistances together with the characteristic impedance of the coaxial cables , approximately equal to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the free space impedance . in our simulations we therefore set @xmath65",
    "this low impedance is a main source of dissipation and noise in the system .",
    "now , kirchhoff s law holds at each superconducting island , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the capacitance to ground .",
    "this gives a coupled system of 2nd order differential equations for the superconducting phases @xmath55 .",
    "these are integrated with a symmetric time discretization using a leap - frog scheme , with a small time step @xmath68 .",
    "each iteration requires the solution of a tridiagonal system of equations . by varying the bias voltage and calculating the resulting current",
    "we obtain the iv - characteristics of the structure .",
    "the voltage is stepped up slowly from zero , or down from a high value , to avoid sharp transient effects near the left lead where the voltage is applied .",
    "we also keep track of the locations and times of phase slip events , i.e. when the phase difference across a junction @xmath69 passes between the disjoint intervals @xmath70 $ ] for integer @xmath71 .",
    "[ fig : fig6]-a shows the @xmath72 as a function of @xmath74 for various samples .",
    "each data point represents the measurement of a different sample at zero magnetic field .",
    "the data in the figure is collected from the measurements of @xmath75 different samples with three lengths and different critical currents .",
    "the chain current , @xmath1 , is taken as the voltage - independent current at large bias voltages ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the figure consists of two distinct parts which are separated by a rapid decrease of the @xmath72 level around @xmath77 where dynamics of the long josephson junction chains undergo a qualitative change .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the what we expect from the rcsj model . at @xmath78",
    "the damping is strong and activation energies for escape and retrapping are similar , every phase - slip event ( escape ) is followed by a phase - sticking ( retrapping ) .",
    "as will be discussed below , this behavior is consistent with the phase - slips happening randomly throughout the chain and a continuous slip - stick process is manifest as a constant current branch in the dc iv curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6]-b ) .",
    "the rate of phase - slip and phase - stick is determined by the bias voltage . in the opposite limit when @xmath79 the damping is small which inhibits phase - sticking .",
    "once the junction starts slipping it continues to slip , resulting in lower @xmath72 and features in the dc iv curve at multiples of the gap voltages , @xmath80 where the nonlinear damping rapidly increases ( fig .",

    "this behavior is expected in the high damping regime and phase - slips happens randomly throughout the chain , without preference for any particular point in space .",
    "[ fig : fig7](c1 ) shows the dc iv curve of point c with @xmath84 .",
    "there are strong gap features in the iv curve and the dissipative branch flattens out at large bias voltages .",

    "[ fig : fig9]-c ) curve shows five distinct peaks : the s.c .",
    "peak around zero bias , two peaks at @xmath93 corresponding to the sum - gap voltage , and two additional peaks at @xmath94 .",

    "[ fig : fig10](b ) shows the distribution of the phase - slips across the array , the gray scale represents the number of phase - slips at each junction and voltage . at low voltages phase - slips tend to accumulate at one end of the chain . at higher voltages they become uniformly distributed across the chain .",
    "this random phase - slip distribution is similar to the simulated behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](a1 ) with high damping . surprisingly , as the bias voltage is further increased a group of junctions loose this randomness and form a cluster with a fixed number of phase - slips , independent of bias voltage ( fig .",

    "this cluster rapidly grows with increasing bias voltage , causing an increase of the chain current . at the maximum extent",
    "there are approximately , @xmath95 junctions in one of the clusters , which is a considerable part of the chain .",
    "after that point as the voltage bias further increased the size of the cluster gradually decreases with the junctions leaving the cluster in the opposite order as they were added .",
    "this gradual decrease creates a second flat branch in the simulated iv curve .",

    "the observation of voltage - independent chain current , @xmath1 is a manifestation of a random process of phase - slipping and phase - sticking that is uniformly distributed throughout the chain .",
    "the phase slip rate is defined by the bias voltage and our simulations showed that voltage independent constant current branch is created by uncorrelated phase slips .",

    "simulations showed that the damping parameter , @xmath85 , is important for defining the distribution of phase - slips and phase - sticking processes in the josephson junction chains .",
    "different phase - slip distributions and phase - sticking processes creates various shapes of the dc iv curves and it is possible gain insight to these processes by just analyzing the shape of the iv curves .",
