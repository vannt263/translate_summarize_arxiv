    "the radial abundance gradient of a disk galaxy is an essential ingredient in an accurate picture of galaxy formation and evolution . during the past twenty years , the existence of an abundance gradient along the milky way disk has been well established by observations using various tracers .",
    "an oxygen and/or iron abundance gradient of about @xmath3  was obtained by observing young stars and hii regions ( see hou & chang 2001 ; rudolph et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) , planetary nebulae ( maciel et al . 2005 ; 2006 ) and open clusters ( friel 1995 , 1999 ; carraro et al . 1998 ; chen et al .",
    "two spiral neighbors of the milky way galaxy in the local group , m33 and m31 have provided further evidence for the existence of disk abundance gradient . a relatively flatter gradient is observed for m31 , which is about @xmath4 ( dennefeld et al .",
    "1981 ; blair et al .",
    "1982 ) . as for m33 ,",
    "the observed value of oxygen abundance gradient diverges greatly at present .",
    "different observers have presented different values based on various objects ( mainly hii regions and b stars ) . published data",
    "show that the oxygen gradient varies from @xmath50.02  to @xmath50.16 ( magrini et al .",
    "2007a ) . a larger and more homogeneous sample of hii regions that covers the whole m33 disk is needed in order to get conclusive results about the real gradients .",
    "such a project is currently undergoing by a couple of groups ( rosolowsky & simon 2008 ; magrini et al .",
    "2007b ) .    nevertheless , it is important to point out that the abundance gradients for different elements are sometimes different due to different nucleosynthetic history , and the exact values for the milky way disk are still not very certain ( deharveng et al .",
    "2000 ; daflon & cunha 2004 ; carraro et al .",
    "this has prevented the chemical evolution models from being constrained clearly .",
    "another question is how the abundance gradient along a galaxy disk evolves during the history of disk evolution . with the help of large samples of open clusters ( ocs ) and planetary nebulae ( pne )",
    ", it is now possible to explore this question observationally .",
    "the estimated ages of ocs and pne of various types span a large fraction of the age of the galaxy .",
    "observations of the abundances of those objects across the milky way disk have provided some important information on the past history of the abundance gradients . indeed ,",
    "current data show that the gradient was steeper in the past ( carraro et al . 1998 , 2007 ; hou et al . 2002 ; chen et al .",
    "2003 ; maciel et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , 2006 ; magrini et al .",
    "2008 ) .    the observed disk abundance gradient and its evolution offer the opportunity to test theories of disk chemical evolution and stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "detailed knowledge about the disk abundance gradient and its time evolution are crucial not only in our understanding of the metal enrichment history along the disk , that is the star formation history , but also very important in our understanding of the metallicity relationship between high redshift dampled lyman alpha systems and local disks ( wolfe et al .",
    "2005 ; hou et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the framework of a phenomenological scenario of disk formation , several mechanisms may play roles in shaping the abundance gradient and its evolution .",
    "one is the star formation processes in the disk .",
    "observations of local disk and starburst galaxies show that the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit area is proportional to some power of the gas mass surface density ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "this non - linear star formation law may result in and largely influence the building of radial abundance gradients .",
    "another mechanism is the so - called `` inside - out '' disk formation . in most classical chemical evolution models",
    ", it is generally assumed that the disk forms by gas infalling from the outer halo , and that the infall can be described by an exponential law , in which the infall time scale is always assumed to be radially dependent @xmath6 , with a smaller value in the inner region and a much larger one in the outer disk ( chang et al .",
    "1999 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ; hou et al . 2000 ; chiappini et al . 2001 ) . on the other hand , many observations show that radial truncation exists in most disk galaxies ( e.g. pohlen et al .",
    "2002 ) , which means there is a change in the slope of total mass surface density and gas mass surface density from a shallow exponential disk to a much steeper one ( de grijs et al .",
    "this truncation radius @xmath7 appears to evolve with the redshift @xmath8 of a galaxy ( azzollini et al .",
    "2008 ) , which is a strong indication that the disk grows from smaller to larger . for a simple phenomenological disk formation model , this property could be described by a disk formation time scale @xmath9 , which is proportional to the radius from the galaxy center . in both cases of @xmath10 and @xmath9",
    ", there is a rapid increase of the metal abundance during the early epochs in the inner disk , leading to a steep abundance gradient .",
    "as time goes on , star formation `` migrates '' to the outer disk , producing metals and flattening the abundance gradient there .",
    "however , the mechanisms mentioned above could work together .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish which one plays a more important role , or if the scenario may be different for various disk galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to understand which mechanism plays the most important role in the origin and evolution of disk abundance gradients in a galactic chemical evolution model .",
    "we concentrate on the milky way disk because there are various observations on its disk abundance , especially the recent pne data ( maciel et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , 2006 ) and open clusters ( chen et al . 2003",
    "; carraro et al .",
    "2007 ) , which provide unique constraints on time evolution of the disk abundance gradient and that could be sensitive to different model assumptions . in section 2 , we will describe the main content of our model , which includes the mechanisms mentioned above . in section 3 , the resulting model radial profiles will be given , and the effect of @xmath11 , sfr , and @xmath9 on the abundance gradient and its evolution will be analyzed .",
    "the best model will be decided by comparing the model results with the observational data .",
    "finally , the main results will be summarized in section 4 .",
    "we assume that the milky way has been embedded in a dark matter halo .",
    "primordial gas within the dark halo cools down to form a rotationally supported disk , which is assumed to be sheet - like and a system of a series of independent rings with the width of 500  pc .",
    "the ring centered at @xmath12 kpc is labeled as the solar neighborhood .",
    "star formation and chemical evolution proceed in each ring due to infalling gas .",
    "the assumption of a gas infall process is traditionally based upon the need to explain the locally observed metallicity distribution of long - lived stars , which can not be explained by the simple `` closed - box '' model ( leading to the well - known `` g - dwarf problem '' , pagel 1989 ) .",
    "recent observations show that the milky way disk ( and also m31 , m33 ) is currently accreting substantial amounts of gas with low metallicity ( @xmath13 1 ) from high velocity clouds ( blitz et al . 1999 ; ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ; thilker et al . 2004 ; ibata et al .",
    "2005 ; van den bergh 2006 ) .",
    "we note that sancisi et al.(2008 ) proposed that the accreting rate of the milky way could be about 0.1@xmath13 0.2 , about ten times less than that required by the observed sfr in the disk . however , there is some evidence that the extra gas may come from a galactic fountain ( sancisi et al .",
    "2008 ) .    like many other phenomenological models",
    ", we also adopt an exponentially decaying gas infall rate @xmath14 as :    @xmath15/\\tau(r ) } & t \\ge t_0 \\left ( r \\right )   \\\\ 0 & t < t_0 \\left ( r \\right ) \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the time when gas at radius @xmath17 begins to infall onto the disk .",
    "@xmath18 is normalized @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the current total ( gas+star ) mass surface density , and @xmath21 is the age of the disk .",
    "we adopt @xmath22  gyr for the milky way .",
    "that means the milky way galaxy formed at the beginning of the universe .",
    "we note that the thin disk is relatively young on average , but the oldest open clusters in the disk could be as old as 10 gyr ( chen et al .",
    "2003 ; carraro et al .",
    "2007 ) , while dwarf stars in the disk have ages as old as that of galaxy . as a working hypothesis",
    ", we shall always assume that the disk is as old as the galaxy ( see also in boissier and prantzos 1999 ; hou et al .",
    "test calculations show that adopting a smaller disk age ( for example , 11  gyr ) does not effect the main results of the model .",
    "this is reasonable since the disk evolves very little in the last several gyr .",
    "we assume that the current total surface density ( unit : ) of the disk has an exponential form : @xmath23 from equations ( [ eq : infall ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , we can get : @xmath24/\\tau ( r ) } } \\right]\\tau \\left ( r \\right)}}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the disk radial scale length , and @xmath26 is the total mass surface density in the solar neighborhood at the present - day .",
    "we adopt @xmath27kpc and @xmath28  for the milky way disk ( robin et al .",
    "1996 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ; holmberg & flynn 2004 ; hammer et al .",
    "the combination of eq.([eq : infall ] ) and eq.([eq : sigmatot ] ) will fix the history of gas infall of disk if @xmath16 and @xmath10 are given .",
    "two cases in the above model correspond to the so - called `` inside - out '' disk formation scenario .",
    "one is represented by the radial dependent infall time scale , e.g. @xmath29 with @xmath30 , which means the infall time scale of the inner disk is shorter than that of the outer disk .",
    "the second is described by radial dependent disk formation time scale @xmath16 , which is somewhat similar to the time dependent disk truncation .",
    "this case , although over - simplified , is supported by both observations ( azzollini et al .",
    "2008 ) and numerical simulations ( rokar et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the real mechanisms for the formation and evolution of the disk truncation are quite complicated and not well understood ( as discussed in azzollini et al . 2008 ; franx et al . 2008 ; rokar et al .",
    "here we just assume the disk size increases with time , i.e. @xmath9 increases with galactic - centric distance @xmath31 .",
    "thus we adopt a simple linear form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a free parameter .",
    "this assumption corresponds to the gradual build - up of the disk from the inner to the outer part .",
    "our purpose is try to understand how this disk truncation influences the disk abundance gradient evolution . in section 3 , we shall discuss how @xmath16 and @xmath10 affect the build - up of radial abundance gradient .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) has shown that the global sfrs of disks and circumnuclear starburst galaxies are correlated with the local gas density .",
    "the entire range of investigated galaxies , spanning a magnitude of 5 - 6 orders in gas mass and sfr surface densities , fits on a common power law with index @xmath34 .",
    "the tight relation shows that a simple schmidt ( 1959 ) power law provides an excellent empirical parameterization of the sfr across an enormous range of sfrs .",
    "it also suggests that the gas density is the primary determinant of the sfr on these scales .",
    "models of galaxy formation and evolution usually adopt this best - fitting kennicutt - schmidt law ( hereafter , classical ks law ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is in unit of .",
    "@xmath37 is in unit of , @xmath38 .    from the observational point of view ,",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) also found a correlation between the observed sfr and the ratio of the surface gas density to the local dynamical time scale , @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , from this correlation one can derive the following parametrization : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angular rotation speed of the gas .",
    "since @xmath42 , the sfr could be expressed as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the disk circular velocity at radius @xmath17 .    in boissier & prantzos ( 1999 ) , the sfr was also expressed as ( hereafter , modified ks law ) : @xmath45 \\left[\\frac{r}{r_\\odot}\\right]^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is in unit of , @xmath44 is in unit of , @xmath17 is in unit of kpc .",
    "the index @xmath46 is chosen to be @xmath13 1.5 on an empirical basis . and for the milky way disk , @xmath47 = 0.1 , @xmath48 .",
    "they also adopted this modified ks law in subsequent models for external spirals , and their models can successfully reproduce the global properties of spirals ( boissier & prantzos 2000 , 2001 ; boissier et al .",
    "2001 ) .    concerning the average properties of sfr and gas mass surface densities ,",
    "the classical ks law was further supported by recent observations .",
    "boissier et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have investigated 43 nearby , late - type galaxies from galex and conclude that , on the average , their results are compatible with classical ks law and can extend this simple law to much lower gas mass surface density .",
    "but for an individual galaxy , some will show a very untypical pattern in the lg(sfr)-lg(@xmath49 ) plot , e.g. the m31 disk , as pointed out by boissier et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and yin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .    in an earlier paper ,",
    "molla et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also investigated the radial abundance distributions for a number of nearby spirals , including the milky way . in treating the star formation processes for different galaxies",
    ", they considered the radially dependent efficiency for the formation of molecular clouds .",
    "the efficiencies are allowed to change from galaxy to galaxy . in this work ,",
    "we have simply adopted the classical ks law ( eq.([eq : kslaw ] ) , kennicutt 1998 ) and modified ks law ( eq.([eq : mkslaw ] ) ) , where the later case is equivalent to a radial dependent efficiency of star formation .",
    "this kind of modified sfr has been extensively adopted during the past for chemical evolution studies of the milky way disk ( see review by matteucci 2001 ) .",
    "but this is not to say that the classical k - s law does not properly in describe disk galaxies .",
    "in fact , the classical ks law has been widely accepted for the average star formation properties of a galaxy . in many studies , especially in semi - analytic modeling of disk galaxies ,",
    "the classical k - s law is often adopted .",
    "the recent space resolved observations for m51a by kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that the index is comparable with the classical ks law , but this does not mean it is valid for all individual galaxies , especially in the past history of a galaxy .",
    "a comparison study is needed based on the disk evolution history .",
    "the time evolution of the abundance gradient and how it changes with galactocentric distance are good constraints .",
    "these kind of constraints have been used less often because there are fewer observational constraints .",

    "2006 ; lemasle et al .",
    "the single linear radial abundance gradient is also questioned by observations from cepheids ( andrievsky et al .",
    "2004 ; lemasle et al .",
    "2008 ) and open clusters ( twarog et al . 1997 ) .",
    "there are also alternative points of view regarding the formation history of the outer galactic disk , in which merger events or accretions of small satellites may be responsible for the unusual metallicity distributions observed in outer open clusters and cepheids ( yong et al .",
    "if this is the case , much sophisticated infall models are needed .",
    "+      as we have already mentioned above , mod - b and c can both produce the proper current abundance gradient , which is consistent with the observed values along the galactic disk .",
    "it is difficult to conclude which one is better .",
    "now we discuss the time evolution of the abundance gradient . for mod - a and c",
    ", we calculate the gradients @xmath86}}{{dr}}$ ] still from the inner part to the outer part of the disk ( 4.0 - 16.2  kpc ) like what we do with current gradient .",
    "but for mod - b , we calculate from the inner part ( 4.0  kpc ) to the outermost boundary where the disk just begins to form by infall gas at time @xmath87 .",
    "when the disk grows up to 16.2  kpc , we fix the radius range to be between 4.0 and 16.2  kpc .",
    "this is also why the curves of model b in fig.[fig : time ] show an abrupt increase in the gradient around 11.8 gyr , since the disk has not grown to 16.2 kpc before this stage .",
    "the predicted evolutions of the abundance gradients for three models are plotted in fig.[fig : time ] . for each model , we calculated three cases for infall time scale , as was indicated in the figure .",
    "the shaded area is the observed oxygen abundance gradient from different pn populations ( maciel et al .",
    "2003 ; 2006 ) . in chen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , a shallow current iron abundance gradient is derived . in checking their data , however , we find that the gradient value heavily relies on one outer young cluster at about 15  kpc .",
    "there are not enough young clusters in the sample at large radius . in order to overcome this shortage ,",
    "we have combined the data of open clusters from friel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , chen et al .",

    "( 2007 ) ( mainly the ocs of @xmath89kpc ) , then we show the evolution of gradients obtained from the samples of 4.0 - 16.2 kpc , where the iron gradient has been transferred to oxygen by the following calibration ( maciel et al .",
    "2005 ) : @xmath90}}{{dr } } = \\frac{1}{\\delta } \\frac{{d[{\\rm{fe / h}}]}}{{dr}}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the coefficient independent of the galactocentric distance , and is about 1.0@xmath92 .",
    "here we adopt @xmath91=1.2 ( maciel et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] , we can find that :    \\1 ) all three models show that the disk abundance gradient is steeper in the early stage of disk evolution .",
    "both model b and c can predict acceptable current abundance gradients when they are compared with the young tracers in the galactic disk .",
    "\\2 ) model a always predicts a flatter abundance gradient compared with other models at any time .",
    "it also predicts a much shallower current gradient compared with the results from young objects ( e.g. hii regions from rudolf et al .",
    "2006 ; cepheids from yong et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we note that there are also a number of observations showing a shallow radial abundance gradient ( deharveng et al .",
    "2000 ; daflon & cunha 2004 ; carraro et al .",
    "2007 ) , but the absolute values for oxygen and iron are still larger than the predictions of model a. so for the milky way disk , if the classical ks law of star formation is adopted , models are not able to reproduce enough of a disk abundance gradient , even if the infall time scale is radially dependent .",
    "\\3 ) although model b can produce a reasonable value of the current gradient by properly adjusting the infall time scale , it predicts a much steeper gradient in the past .",
    "this is not supported by current available observations from planetary nebulae and open clusters .",
    "the steep abundance gradient at early times is due to the fact that the disk formation time scale in model b is radial dependent which results in a delayed gas infall process and star formation in the outer disk .",
    "\\4 ) model c can predict not only the current values of abundance gradient along the milky way disk , but also the evolution of gradient which is fairly consistent with observations from pne and ocs .",
    "since the classical ks law was derived from the average sfr and gas mass surface densities for a whole galaxy ( kennicutt 1998 ) , we expect that the modified ks star formation law , that is the radial dependent sfr , would be more suitable when we deal with the local star formation processes within a galaxy .",
    "+    now we further compare the model results with other constraints , such as the gas , sfr and stellar profiles in the milky way disk . according to the discussions given above , the form and the value of infall time scale @xmath11",
    "does not affect the radial profiles greatly , so we shall adopt @xmath93 .",
    "the results for all three models are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "the observational data of current gas surface density @xmath36 come from dame et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , @xmath94 from gusten & mezger ( 1983 ) , lyne et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , guibert et al . ( 1978 ) , and chiappini et al . (",
    "the data of @xmath69 are from the solar neighbourhood value @xmath95 ( gilmore et al . 1989 ) and extend to the whole disk with an exponential radial profile of stars , in which @xmath96 kpc ( sackett 1997 , hammer et al .",
    "the oxygen abundance profile is from rudolph et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] , we can see that , in general , all of the three models are able to predict a reasonable profile for @xmath69 and @xmath97 . since the observed sfr and stellar mass surface density are quite uncertain , they are not good tracers to constrain model results .",
    "however , based on the observed gas and abundance profiles , it is clear that mod - a is not a good choice since it is difficult to get acceptable matches to the data no matter how we modulate infall time scale . but both model b and c are acceptable , and model c is relatively much better , for it is consistent with the above discussions based on the past history of abundance gradient .",
    "based on a simple model of galactic chemical evolution , which includes infall , star formation and delayed disk formation , we have investigated the origin and evolution of the radial abundance gradient of a disk galaxy . by comparing the model results with the observations in the milky way disk",
    ", we try to find the effect of each mechanism on shaping abundance gradients and decide which one plays the main role .      1 .   for all adopted models and parameters ,",
    "the predicted radial abundance gradients are steeper in the early epoch of disk evolution , which is consistent with observations of planetary nebulae and open clusters .",
    "the disk formation time scale @xmath16 could be the most important parameter governing the production of the abundance gradient , no matter what sfr and infall time scale are assumed . in this case",
    ", the inner disk accretes infalling gas earlier than the outer part , thus star formation and metal enrichment start earlier in the inner region .",
    "however , this will predict a very steep abundance gradient in the past , which is not consistent with the observations .",
    "besides @xmath16 , the radial dependence of sfr will further strengthen the gradient . if @xmath16 is not considered ( i.e. @xmath98 in eq.([eq : t0 ] ) )",
    ", sfr plays the main role in shaping the disk abundance gradient .",
    "we find that the radially dependent sfr @xmath99 is a suitable model to fit the observational data in the milky way disk , while the classical ks law @xmath100 without @xmath9 can not produce a current abundance gradient steep enough to match those that have been observed in the galactic disk from cepheids and hii regions .",
    "4 .   relative to @xmath9 and sfr , the infall time scale @xmath11 only plays a minor role in shaping the abundance gradient . given a certain sfr , the adopted form of @xmath10 will not significantly change the gradient . but compared with constant infall time scale , an `` inside - out '' assumption for the time scale could help to produce some degree of abundance gradient . 5 .",
    "when we divide the disk into inner and outer parts at the intersection radius of 8  kpc , our model predicts a steeper gradient in the outer disk .",
    "we note that there are observations showing a flatter abundance gradient for the outer galactic disk based on different tracers , such as open clusters , cepheids , and young stars .",
    "but there are also other independent studies that do not show evidence of a flattening gradient toward outer disk .",
    "observations from cepheids also show that the galactic iron gradient might be more accurately described by a bimodal distribution , especially in the outer disk .",
    "all of those shows a complicated formation history of the outer galactic disk .",
    "further observational work and more sophisticated models need to be done before we can have a more clear understanding of the outer disk formation .    in summary",
    ", we expect that for an individual milky way type galaxy , a better description of the sfr is the modified ks star formation law .",
    "in fact , the modified ks law can also be written as @xmath101 .",
    "this is equivalent to classical ks law , only the normalization coefficient @xmath102 ( which is related to star formation efficiency ) is inversely proportional to the distance from the galaxy center .",
    "this kind of sfr could well reproduce the observed galactic disk abundance gradient and its time evolution .",
