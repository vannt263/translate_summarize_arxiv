    "in order to use the x - ray background in the type of analysis suggested above two questions must be answered : `` how well do x - ray sources trace matter ? '' and `` what is the redshift distribution of the x - ray emission ? '' .",
    "the latter of these questions will be addressed using a particular model of x - ray sources @xcite to compute the intensity - redshift distribution , @xmath8 , i.e. the portion of the intensity of the x - ray background that arises at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "the results presented in this paper are not very sensitive to the particular form of @xmath8 as long as a signficant portion of the intensity arises from redshifts around @xmath10 .",
    "this is the case for most current models of the x - ray background .",
    "how well x - rays trace matter is less well known . in this paper",
    "we will assume a simple linear bias , i.e. that the fractional fluctuations in x - ray emissivity are linearly proportional to the fractional mass density fluctuations , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the bias factor .",
    "the linear bias assumption would hold if the x - ray sources were produced at the high peaks of a gaussian random field , in which case the bias @xmath12 would be approximately the height @xmath13 of the peaks , in units of the standard deviation on the appropriate smoothing scale .",
    "more generally , it is quite plausible that x - ray sources trace the matter density , and the linear bias model may be taken as a crude parametrization of this .",
    "for example , if x - ray sources are produced by local physical processes which are completely independent of the long wavelength density perturbations , one would have @xmath14 , whatever the statistics of the density field .    while the source of the x - ray background is still very much an area of intense research ,",
    "it is already clear that discrete sources are the major component .",
    "deep rosat observations have resolved @xmath15 of the soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) x - ray background into discrete sources @xcite and unified agn ( seyfert galaxies and quasars ) models have successfully described both the spectrum and the brightness of the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) background @xcite as well as the local volume emissivity @xcite . despite the successes of these models , it is quite possible that they will have to be modified in some way ( e.g. more detailed evolution , refined spectra , a less ` unified ' agn model , a new population of sources , etc . ) as more is learned about x - ray sources . in particular , correlation and fluctuation analyses",
    "are still not well understood in either the hard or soft bands @xcite .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that the average flux distribution , @xmath8 , will be greatly changed by such modifications .",
    "given that the isw effect is not particularly sensitive to the detailed shape of @xmath8 , we do not believe that such modifications to the model will have a large effect on the results of this paper .",
    "the estimate of the x - ray bias factor , @xmath12 , is more problematic .",
    "measurements of the local x - ray bias are still uncertain . from the dipole anisotropy of the local agn distribution , estimated that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is fraction of the total gravitational acceleration of the local group contributed by matter within 45 @xmath18 mpc , @xmath19 is the matter density , and @xmath20 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath21 . for @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 this implies @xmath24 .",
    "however , it is not clear if the bias measured in such nearby x - ray sources is appropriate on the much larger scales of interest for the isw effect .",
    "for example , it is possible that emission from nearby clusters might make the local bias appear higher .    in the context of a given theory , where the power spectrum of density fluctuations is known and appropriately normalized by the cobe detection of the anisotropies",
    ", it is also possible to place an upper limit on the x - ray bias by observing the angular auto - correlation function ( acf ) of the x - ray background .",
    "one can compare this to that predicted by the theory assuming a linear , scale - independent bias .",
    "unfortunately , the large scale ( @xmath25 ) angular correlations of the x - ray background have not been accurately measured . from our own measurements of the acf of the hard background we found that , in the context of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models with a cosmological constant , @xmath26 ( see table 1 )",
    "this should be considered as an upper limit since the heao beam size is large ( @xmath27 ) and can itself induce correlations even when viewing randomly placed sources .",
    "while limits found in this manner are necessarily model dependent , they do provide important context for assessing the viability of a model .",
    "one might argue by analogy with other populations .",
    "ordinary galaxies have correlation lengths of order @xmath28 mpc @xcite and are thought to be only mildly biased , @xmath29 .",
    "this might be considered a reasonable lower limit to the x - ray bias .",
    "the correlation lengths , of radio galaxies @xcite , qso s @xcite , and groups of galaxies @xcite are all on the order of 10 - 18@xmath18 mpc .",
    "if , as seems likely , hard x - ray sources have similar clustering properties to these , then we expect the x - ray bias to be of order @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "rich clusters of galaxies are even more strongly correlated @xcite , @xmath31 and if x - ray sources are instead like these it would imply @xmath32 it is well known that the x - ray background is highly correlated with these other objects @xcite ; however , the correlation length is still uncertain .",
    "it is clear that the x - ray bias ( if indeed linear bias is a good description of the distribution of x - ray sources ) is not well known .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to report our results with x - ray bias as an unknown parameter .    finally , as an independent , qualitative check on how x - rays trace mass we have cross - correlated the heao 2 - 10 kev map with the appropriately smoothed and binned greenbank 5 ghz radio source counts @xcite .",
    "the correlation coefficient of these two maps is signficant , @xmath33 , indicating that they are tracing correlated populations .",
    "the cross - correlation function can also be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the x - ray intensity of the radio sources , @xmath36 the intensity of other x - ray sources in the field , @xmath37 is the average number of radio sources in a resolution element , and @xmath38 is the cross - correlation coefficient between radio sources and the x - ray sources . since the numerical value of @xmath39 is 0.03 , either 3% of the x - ray background is due to the 5 ghz radio sources or the correlation coefficient between radio sources and x - ray sources is on the order of @xmath40 . in either case , the implication is that x - ray sources are signficantly clustered .",
    "the greenbank radio sources are themselves strongly correlated with correlation lengths of @xmath41 mpc @xcite .",
    "when smoothed on the heao beam scale the radio source correlation coefficient is @xmath42 .",
    "these values are comparable to @xmath43 deduced from the x - ray auto - correlation function ( see section [ sec : acf - d ] ) .",
    "the greenbank survey is dominated by moderate redshift ( @xmath44 ) sources @xcite which implies ( with some assumption about x - ray source evolution ) that most of contribution to the cross - correlation , @xmath45 , comes from the redshift range @xmath46 .",
    "this redshift interval is the source of rougly 25% of the x - ray background ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fdn ] ) .",
    "similar results were found cross - correlating the x - ray background with the first radio survey @xcite .",
    "these results can not be made more quantitative without a detailed analysis of the x - ray / radio source cross - correlation which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we will focus here on the two point correlations of the microwave temperature and x - ray intensity , and the related power spectrum of the density fluctuations .",
    "the density can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the average matter density at proper time @xmath49 .",
    "the power spectrum is defined as the fourier transform of the two point correlation function and is given by , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the present time .",
    "( note that we will use @xmath53 and @xmath54 to refer to comoving position and wavenumber . )",
    "all sky maps of the x - ray intensity or temperature fluctuations can be naturally expanded in terms of spherical harmonics .",
    "for example , we can write the fluctuation in x - ray intensity as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and * n * is the unit direction vector .",
    "a similar expression can be written for the temperature anisotropy @xmath57 .",
    "the expectation value of the moments defines an angular power spectrum @xmath58 which is related to the expectation value of the autocorrelation function by @xmath59[eq : acf ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a legendre polynominal .      in the approximation of instantaneous recombination",
    ", the microwave anisotropy in a direction @xmath62 on the sky is given in newtonian gauge by @xmath63_{\\tau_r } ^{\\tau_0 } + 2 \\int_{\\tau_r } ^{\\tau_0 } d\\tau \\dot{\\phi } ( \\tau , { \\bf n } ( \\tau_0-\\tau)).\\label{eq : esw}\\ ] ] the integral is over the conformal time @xmath64 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the times of recombination and the present , respectively .",
    "the first term ( @xmath67 ) represents density perturbations of the radiation - baryon fluid , the second term is the doppler shift ( @xmath68 ) , and the third is the newtonian potential ( @xmath69 ) , where all of these are evaluated on the surface of last scattering .",
    "the last term , usually called the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) term , represents the effect of a time varying gravitional potential along the line of sight .",
    "heuristically , it represents the redshifting of photons which ` climb out ' of a different potential than they ` fell into ' .",
    "the cmb anisotropies are the sum of contributions created near the surface of last scattering and those created recently by the isw effect .",
    "since the two contributions are associated with perturbations of very different wavelengths , they are nearly uncorrelated except on the largest angular scales .",
    "the moments can be written as , @xmath70 and the fact that they are weakly correlated implies @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    the isw term arises when the cmb photons pass through a potential fluctuation which is evolving in time , i.e. @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the conformal distance , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a spherical bessel function . squaring this and integrating over the directions of @xmath54 , we find @xmath78      to evaluate the expected x - ray brightness fluctuations , a model is needed which describes the redshift distribution of the sources , as well as their luminousities .",
    "we consider the unified agn model of , which reproduces source number counts and the flux and spectrum of the x - ray background in both soft and hard x - ray bands . in this model ,",
    "agn are divided into two luminosity classes , seyfert galaxies and quasars , which range in x - ray luminosity from @xmath79 to @xmath80 ( 0.3 - 3.5 kev ) .",
    "the power - law luminosity function has a break at a luminosity of @xmath81 where agn with luminosities @xmath82 are designated seyferts and those with @xmath83 are designated quasars .    the agn are thought to be surrounded by an absorbing molecular torus , with the amount of absorption depending on the line of sight .",
    "as an approximation , the agn are divided into five absorption classes characterized by their @xmath84 column density , with column densities ranging from zero up to @xmath85 the number density of each class is proportional to the number density of unabsorbed agn , i.e. @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) is the total number of unabsorbed seyferts ( quasars ) and the index @xmath90 runs over absorption class . the relative density in each class is assumed to be independent of both source luminosity and redshift .",
    "a detailed description of this division and the associated spectra can be found in .",
    "the average number of agn in a volume at redshift @xmath9 is @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the angular diameter distance , @xmath94 is the solid angle and @xmath95 is proper radial distance .",
    "proper distance can be expressed as @xmath96 where `` @xmath97 '' is the expansion factor and primes indicate derivatives with respect to proper time . in the comastri model ,",
    "the comoving number density is assumed to be constant , so that @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the total unabsorbed agn density .",
    "it can be expressed as , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the luminosity function of seyferts and @xmath102 the luminosity function of quasars .",
    "another key feature of most x - ray models is that the x - ray luminosity evolves with redshift as @xmath103 the comastri model assumes @xmath104 and a cutoff redshift , @xmath105 , above which the luminosity is assumed to be constant , up to maximum redshift of @xmath106 .",
    "there is some evidence the evolution could be even stronger than assumed by comastri et al .",
    ", with a slightly higher index , @xmath107 , and a somewhat lower cutoff redshift , @xmath108 .",
    "a detailed examination of these luminosity models is found in .",
    "the flux received from an object at a given redshift is related to its luminosity by @xmath109 where the luminosity distance @xmath110 is related to the angular distance by @xmath111 . for band",
    "limited detectors this relation becomes @xmath112 where @xmath113 now represents the energy emitted in the detector band @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115 is the usual k - correction @xmath116 since the k - correction depends on @xmath117 , the spectrum of the source , it is a different function for each absorbtion class .    at a given redshift the flux averaged over the various types of agn",
    "is obtained by summing over both luminosity and absorption , i.e. , @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we denote the term in parentheses as @xmath121 , the average k - corrected luminosity per unit volume .",
    "for the absorbed spectra used by , this factor can be approximated by @xmath122 .    finally ,",
    "the `` space weighting function '' , i.e. the contribution to the band limited x - ray intensity as a function of redshift , is @xmath123 using the fact that @xmath124 for the flat cosmologies studied here , and simplifying , the weighting function is @xmath125    figure [ fig : fdn ] is a plot of @xmath126 in arbitrary units .",
    "it is clear from this figure that much of the flux arises from sources at redshifts of order @xmath127 as required in order to detect a significant isw effect .",
    "the shape of the distribution is fairly flat and is similar to ( though it extends to somewhat higher redshifts ) the distribution used in which used @xmath128 measured in a flux limited survey and assumed that the flux received from an object at a given redshift was constant .",
    "it should be noted that for their analysis adopted a hubble constant of @xmath129 and a deceleration parameter of @xmath130 .",
    "the fact that these differ from the cosmological parameters of the models in this paper is not of great concern since ultimately we only use the space weighting function which is directly tied to observations and is , therefore , relatively insensitive to the cosmological model . in any case , as was pointed out previously , the isw effect is not overly sensitive to the space weighting function .      given a model for the space weighting function , we then must calculate the fluctuations in intensity .",
    "let @xmath131 be the number of agn in a volume @xmath132 at a position @xmath53 and redshift @xmath9 . if number density fluctuations are assumed to be related to mass density fluctuations by a redshift dependent bias @xmath12 , then @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the average number of agn , and @xmath135 for simplicity , throughout we will assume that the bias is independent of redshift .",
    "the evolution of the mass density fluctuation is characterized by , @xmath136 for flat , matter dominated cosmologies , perturbations grow proportionally to the scale factor , that is , @xmath137 however , for alternative cosmologies such as those with a cosmological constant , or with significant curvature , perturbations eventually cease to grow .",
    "the intensity of x - rays in a given direction is just the sum of the flux from each galaxy , @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the flux we receive from a galaxy at redshift @xmath9 and @xmath140 .",
    "thus , the x - ray intensity fluctuations on the sky are @xmath141    this allows one to solve for the x - ray correlation function . by fourier expanding the present density fluctuation , @xmath142 inserting this into equation ( [ eq : diota ] ) , one can show that @xmath143 where , @xmath144 the argument defines a weighting function which determines how deeply in redshift the x - rays probe . as above , using the expression for the moments and integrating over the directions of @xmath54 , the x - ray angular power spectrum is @xmath145 if the fluctuations have a harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum , @xmath146 , then this implies that @xmath147 is constant for low multipoles .",
    "the x - ray autocorrelation function is given by ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : acf ] ) @xmath148 note that @xmath149 is proportional to @xmath150 .",
    "this treatment is similar to previous calculations of the x - ray background fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in addition to fluctuations from structure , poisson fluctuations due to the discreteness of the x - ray sources will also contribute to the x - ray auto - correlation function .",
    "in general , the random placement of nearby objects causes this term to dominate the correlation function and the contribution formally diverges if arbitrarily high flux objects are considered . in practice , a high end flux cutoff eliminates the divergence .",
    "the poisson contribution to the correlation can be written as @xmath151 where @xmath152 represents the angular beam profile of the detector .",
    "this contribution to the acf , which is independent of bias , must be corrected for in order to compare observations with cosmological models .",
    "the models we consider are spatially flat and are primarily composed of cold dark matter ( cdm ) with a cosmological constant .",
    "we assume the baryon density is constrained by @xmath153 , though the dependence on baryon density is relatively weak .",
    "the initial fluctuations are assumed to be adiabatic fluctuations with a scale invariant harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum .",
    "the present power spectrum is determined from the transfer function and to simplify the analysis , we have focused on models which have transfer functions with the same shape , as parameterized by @xmath154 .",
    "( see , for example , and references therein . )",
    "we normalize the models using the variance in the cmb on @xmath155 , as measured by cobe dmr @xcite . from the growth of perturbations ,",
    "the power spectrum scales approximately as @xmath156@xcite .",
    "however , at large @xmath7 , this dependence is softened due to the late time isw effect .",
    "while a more complete analysis of the model normalization can be made using the full cobe data @xcite , using the @xmath155 variance is adequate for the present treatment .",
    "this normalization differs from previous calculations of the x - ray fluctuations which normalized with respect to @xmath157 , the standard deviation of the mass in a sphere of radius 8 @xmath158@xcite .",
    "roughly , the cobe normalization corresponds to a normalization of @xmath159 for the @xmath160 models we consider here .",
    "since we are interested in the x - ray bias , it is important to understand what part of the power spectrum is probed by the fluctuations in the x - ray background . a rough estimate can be made from the flux cut of the survey and its angular resolution .",
    "for the given flux cut , @xmath161 , an agn with mean luminousity @xmath162 would be removed from consideration if it were closer than @xmath163 corresponding to a redshift of @xmath164 obviously , objects dimmer or brighter than the mean luminousity could be closer or further away , but this distance should be a reasonable approximation . given a resolution of approximately @xmath165 , this implies that the correlation is sensitive to structures on scales greater than @xmath166 or so .    for a given theoretical model , this can be made more rigorous by considering which wavenumbers contribute to the correlation . assuming a gaussian window function , the smoothed correlation function can be written as , @xmath167 where @xmath168 denotes the fwhm ( full width half max ) resolution . from the above expression for @xmath169 , we can define @xmath170 ( this is analogous to @xmath171 defined by . ) with this , @xmath172 then represents the contribution to the x - ray variance for a given resolution from each log interval of wavenumber .    figure [ fig : pk ] shows the contributions versus wavenumber for two sample models .",
    "one can see that the correlations arise due to modes between @xmath173 , near the peak of the power spectrum .",
    "thus it spans the gap between those sampled in large scale structure surveys and those probed by cmb measurements .",
    "there are two primary effects which determine the inferred x - ray bias : the normalization of the spectrum and the evolution of perturbations , and these effects partially offset each other .",
    "the x - ray bias scales as @xmath174 and @xmath175 , the area under the curve , scales as @xmath176 .",
    "only the anisotropies created recently are correlated with the x - ray fluctuations described above . since",
    "that is the case , anisotropies produced at last scattering can be ignored and only the isw contribution to the cross correlation need be considered .",
    "the cross correlation between the x - ray and the microwave backgrounds is defined as @xmath177 following the same procedures used above , these coefficients can be shown to be @xmath178 because of the statistical nature of the background anisotropies , the correlations expressed in equation [ eq : cxt ] represent ensemble averages . a particular realization ,",
    "@xmath179 , of @xmath180 can be easily evaluted . assuming each @xmath181 is gaussian distributed with variance @xmath169 , then @xmath182 ^ 2 \\over c_l^{t}}\\right)^{1/2 } \\xi_{2,m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath183 are numbers randomly chosen from independent gaussian distributions with @xmath184 .",
    "a particular realization is , then , @xmath185 where @xmath186 the distributions of @xmath187 for 1000 realizations of several different cosmological constant models are represented in figure [ fig : hist ] .",
    "the spreads of the distributions reflect chance alignments of regions of enhanced ( depleted ) x - ray intensity with regions of enhanced ( depleted ) cmb intensity .",
    "the latter are due primarily to the cmb anisotropies produced at last scattering and are , therefore , uncorrelated with x - ray emission .",
    "these accidental correlations can be thought of as a form of `` cosmic variance '' .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "3 were computed assuming full sky maps .",
    "limited sky coverage increases the spread .",
    "it should be noted that widths of the distributions are approximately independent of @xmath188 .",
    "the effect of the usual cosmic variance , i.e. the variance of the actual isw effect due to the statistical nature of density fluctuations , is small .",
    "the profiles are roughly gaussian and we treat this effect as any other source of noise in the measurement .    note that we have chosen to plot the quantity @xmath189 which is independent of the bias @xmath12 in the theoretical calculations .",
    "all of the quantities in this expression are measureable .",
    "@xmath190 has been measured by cobe and a limit on @xmath191 is reported in this paper . however , as discussed above , the measurements of @xmath192 are still ambiguous . in order to compare the model predictions in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] with observations , we will take @xmath193 to be that predicted by a given cosmologial model modulo @xmath194 .",
    "the results will then be given as a limit on the cosmological constant in terms of the unknown x - ray bias .",
    "the heao1 a2 experiment was designed to measure surface brightness in the @xmath195 x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the present analysis is from two medium energy detectors ( med ) with different fields of view ( @xmath196 and @xmath197 fwhm ) and two high energy detectors ( hed3 ) with the same fields of view .",
    "counts from these four detectors were combined and binned in 24,576 @xmath198 pixels in an equatorial quadrilateralized spherical cube projection on the sky @xcite .",
    "the combined map has an effective angular resolution diameter ( fwhm ) of @xmath199 and a spectral resolution of roughly @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "all data used in this analysis were collected during the 6-month period beginning on day 322 of 1977 .",
    "the dominant feature in the heao map is the galaxy , so all data within @xmath201 of the galactic plane and within @xmath202 of the galactic center were cut from the map .",
    "in addition , @xmath203 diameter regions around 90 discrete x - ray sources with @xmath200 fluxes larger than @xmath204 @xcite were removed .",
    "finally , the x - ray map itself was searched for weak point `` sources '' that exceeded the nearby background by a specified amount and @xmath205 diameter regions around these were removed .",
    "cuts were made at several levels from 4 to 10 times the photon counting noise resulting in `` cleaned '' maps with sky coverage of from 26% to 47% .",
    "the analysis that follows is for the 6 @xmath206 cut which removed sources with fluxes greater than @xmath207 .",
    "the final `` cleaned '' map corresponds to 1/3 of full sky coverage ; however , the results of this paper are largely independent of the level of the cuts .    even after cleaning ,",
    "the heao map has several components of large - scale systematic structure which can be corrected for .",
    "if the dipole moment of the cmb is a kinematic effect , as it has been widely interpreted @xcite , then the hard x - ray background should possess a similar dipole structure ( compton - getting effect ) with an amplitude of @xmath208 .",
    "the cleaned map was corrected for this effect .",
    "in addition , a linear time drift in detector sensivity @xcite results in large - scale structure of known form . finally , the 2 - 10 kev background shows evidence of high latitude galactic emission as well as emission associated with the superglactic plane @xcite .",
    "we modeled these latter three effects as a combination of a linear time drift , a galactic secant law , the haslam 408 mhz galactic radio map , and a simple pancake supercluster .",
    "this model was linearly regressed to the cleaned data and subsquently subtracted from the map .",
    "of the four parameters , the time drift and secant law were most significant .",
    "correcting for these effects significantly reduced the large scale structure in the x - ray autocorrelation function but had little effect at small angular scales as expected ( see section [ sec : acf - d ] ) .",
    "when the compton - getting dipole was included in the fit ( 3 additional parameters ) , the results did not change significantly .    because of the ecliptic longitude scan pattern of the heao satellite , sky coverage and , therefore , photon shot noise were not uniform . however , the mean variance of the cleaned , corrected map , @xmath209 tot counts / sec , is considerably larger than the mean variance of photon shot noise , @xmath210 tot counts / sec , where tot counts / sec is the standard heao1 a2 normalization for the 2 - 10 kev band @xcite",
    ". the correlation analysis of section [ sec : acf - d ] demonstrates that the variance in the heao map is due to small angular scale ( @xmath211 ) intensity fluctuations ; therefore , the x - ray map is dominated by `` real '' ( not photon noise ) structure .",
    "for this reason , in the correlation analyses that follow , we chose to weight each pixel equally .",
    "the cmb map was constructed from the 53 ghz and 90 ghz 4-year cobe dmr maps as obtained from the national space science data center @xcite .",
    "each map consists of 6144 @xmath212 pixels in an ecliptic quadrilateralized spherical cube projection , i.e. half the resolution of the x - ray map .",
    "the 31 ghz maps have considerably larger instrument noise and galactic contamination and were not used in this analysis @xcite . these four temperature maps ( a and b channels for each frequency ) were converted from antenna to thermodynamic temperature and then combined in a straight average to form the composite cmb map .",
    "this straight average map has somewhat larger instrumental noise than a noise weighted average map ; however , the noise in the crosscorrelation function is dominated by `` cosmic variance '' ( see section [ sec : acf - d ] ) and we felt that a straight average would be more likely to minimized unknown systematic effects in the composite map .",
    "the same galatic cut ( within @xmath201 of the galactic plane and within @xmath202 of the galactic center ) was applied to the cmb map as to the x - ray map which results in 64% sky coverage .",
    "the only correction made to the cleaned composite cmb map was to fit and remove the dipole moment . since the quadrupole moment was included in the analysis of section ii - c , no attempt was made to remove it from the data .",
    "the removal of a secant law fit to high galactic latitude emission made no significant difference in the cross - correlation function ( see section [ sec : acf - d ] ) and so the cmb map was not corrected for galaxy emission . in any case , the analysis of this paper concerns the shape of the cross - correlation function at relatively small angular scales ( @xmath213 ) and is not overly sensitive to the presence of large scale structure in the map .    as with heao ,",
    "the cobe satellite sky coverage was not uniform ; therefore , instrument noise per pixel is also not uniform over the sky . in this case",
    "the mean variance in the cleaned , corrected cmb map is @xmath214 whereas the mean variance of instrument noise is @xmath215 , i.e. at the resolution of the map , instrument noise dominates real structure .",
    "however , when smoothed in @xmath203 bins , instrument noise variance becomes @xmath216 compared to the @xmath217 fluctuations of the cmb @xcite .",

    "note that the pairs are given equal weight as discussed above .",
    "the results for the cleaned x - ray map are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acf ] .",
    "the value at @xmath221 has been corrected for contribution of uncorrelated photon shot noise . to check for the contribution to the acf of weak x - ray sources in nearby galaxies , @xmath222 diameter holes around all ( 2367 ) galaxies in the tully atlas of nearby galaxies @xcite were cut from the map .",
    "these cuts did not significantly change the acf .    taking into account the finite angular resolution of the heao map ,",
    "the amplitude of the acf is somewhat smaller than that found by for the rosat @xmath223 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the soltan et al .",
    "results are inconsistent with other measurements @xcite leading them to hypothesize diffuse emission from large ( 20 mpc ) clouds of gas .    it should be emphasized that the acf in fig . [",
    "fig : acf ] has not been corrected for poisson noise due to unresolved sources .",
    "the model of indicates that source confusion is substantially less that the measured value while the source counts of and butcher ( see @xcite ) imply a substantial amount of source confusion . on the other hand , poor angular resolution results in shape of the acf being dominated by the beam profile . for these reasons",
    "we have not chosen to estimate the correction for source confusion and the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : acf ] should be considered an upper limit to the acf due to clustering of x - ray sources .",
    "[ fig : acf ] also shows the theoretical acf arising from a cdm power spectrum with @xmath224 , ( @xmath160 ) , a bias of @xmath225 , and smoothed by a @xmath226 gaussian beam . recall that the height of the theoretical acf is proportional to @xmath150",
    "the sources were assumed to be distributed as in the model of with a flux cutoff equal to that applied to the real data . clearly this bias is a good fit to the model ; however , to the extent that the observed acf is contaminated by source confusion , it should be considered an upper limit for this model .",
    "raising @xmath227 has the effect of adding small scale power , and so would reduce the bias required to fit the x - ray acf .",
    "the cleaned , corrected x - ray map was reprojected onto the sky to match the cobe map , i.e. , an ecliptic quadrilateralized spherical cube projection with @xmath228 pixels .",
    "let @xmath229 be the number of original pixels combined to form one pixel in the new projection .",
    "the value of @xmath229 for most pixels was 4 ; however , because of the transformation to ecliptic coordinates , @xmath229 ranged from 1 to 6 .",
    "the terms in the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) are weighted with these values .",
    "the cross correlation is then computed as , @xmath230 where the sum is over all pairs with angular separation @xmath219 .",
    "the resulting cross correlation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccf ] , where the normalization is with repect to the @xmath231 rms fluctuations of the two maps .",
    "also shown are the theoretical predictions for cosmological constant models with varying @xmath188 . as described previously , the hubble constant has also been varied to keep the shape parameter , @xmath227 , fixed .",
    "finally , the solid curves represent the @xmath232 uncertainty due to the combination of cosmic variance , instrument noise , and photon shot noise .",
    "the spread in the distribution illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] did not include the effects of map cleaning , map correction , and reduced sky coverage .",
    "in addition , there are quite likely additional fluctuations in the x - ray map that do not appear the x - ray model , e.g. relatively nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "therefore , we chose to compute the total `` noise '' by a monte carlo method wherein the real , cleaned x - ray map was cross - correlated with an ensemble of 400 randomly generated cmb maps .",
    "these latter maps consisted of random realizations of instrument noise and cosmic structure which was constructed so as to have the same acf profile as the actual cobe data .",
    "all the monte carlo cmb maps were cleaned ( galaxy cut ) and corrected ( dipole removal ) with the same procedure as used on the real map .",
    "the resultant total noise is correlated on angular scales of about @xmath203 .",
    "this is due primarily to the finite angular resolution of the cobe map .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : ccf ] that the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the two maps are uncorrelated .",
    "the above results assume that fluctuations in the x - ray map are dominated by poisson fluctuations of unresolved sources .",
    "if there is a significant contribution to the x - rays from this poisson noise , then both the inferred x - ray bias and the predictions for the theoretical correlation are reduced by a factor of @xmath233 therefore , for any particular bias , the model amplitudes should be scaled as @xmath234 . in any case",
    ", it seems unlikely that the bias would be less than unity .",
    "the upper limit of the ccf at @xmath221 is consistent with previous correlation analyses @xcite between heao1-a2 and temperature anisotropy maps .",
    "the correlation analysis of the cobe dmr maps and the rosat pspc all - sky survey @xcite shows somewhat more structure than fig . [ fig : acf ] .",
    "this is presumably due to a larger galactic contriubtion at 1 kev .",
    "as previously discussed , the observed heao / cobe cross - correlation is consistant with there being no underlying isw effect , i.e. no cosmological constant .",
    "since the effective errors computed by monte carlo analysis ( see section [ sec : ccf - d ] ) are consistent with being derived from a correlated gaussian distribution , we can quantify this by performing a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "the likelihood is defined by @xmath235^{-{1 \\over 2 } } \\exp [ -{1 \\over 2}r^{-1}_{ij}(y_i - \\bar{y}_i)(y_j - \\bar{y}_j)],\\ ] ] where @xmath236 is the covariance matrix and @xmath237 is the theoretical prediction for the @xmath238 observation . to a good approximation , the theoretical cross - correlation curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccf ] have the same shape and only differ in amplitude ( which depends only on @xmath239 ) , @xmath240 where @xmath241 . maximizing the likelihood for this amplitude ,",
    "one finds , @xmath242 and the variance in this amplitude is given by , @xmath243 since `` cosmic variance '' is the dominant uncertainty , we calculate the covariance matrix from the correlations of the x - ray map with the simulated cmb maps .",
    "although this implicitly assumes that there are no correlations between the maps , it is a good approximation when the isw effect is small as discussed in section [ sec : ccf ] .",
    "the most likely amplitude is found to be @xmath244 , based on the measured correlation for @xmath245 .",
    "( at larger separations the models predict little correlation . )",
    "this corresponds to a 95 % cl upper limit of @xmath246 ( @xmath247 ) , and a 98 % cl upper limit of @xmath248 ( @xmath249 ) .",
    "the amplitudes , @xmath250 , for different models are summarized in table 1 along with the x - ray biases inferred from the x - ray map assuming all of the x - ray fluctuations result from large scale structure . under this assumption , @xmath251 is just ruled out at the 95 % cl .",
    "as discussed above , if there is a significant contribution to the x - rays from poisson noise , then both the inferred x - ray bias and the predictions for the theoretical correlation are reduced by a factor of @xmath233 included in the table are the expected amplitudes for a fixed x - ray bias , @xmath252 or @xmath3 if @xmath253 , @xmath254 is still ruled out at the 95 % cl . in the most pessimistic case , with @xmath252",
    ", none of the models can be ruled out .",
    "[ tab : res ]    .the inferred biases and the expected cross correlation amplitutudes , @xmath255 for a range of models with @xmath160 .",
    "the inferred biases and the first column of amplitudes assume that the x - ray fluctuations result solely from large scale structure .",
    "the other amplitudes assume a fixed x - ray bias , @xmath252 or @xmath3 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the analysis we have presented has been conservative in the sense that we have only used the x - ray temperature cross correlation to constrain the models .",
    "for nonzero cosmological constant , the spectrum @xmath169 of temperature anisotropies shows a rise at low @xmath256 which is absent in the cobe spectrum .",
    "inclusion of the latter in our analysis would therefore strengthen our bound on @xmath7 .",
    "( for example , see . )",
    "we have chosen not to do so because the low @xmath256 rise is a more model - dependent effect than the x - ray temperature correlation , it being possible to remove the former completely by a tilt in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , a future analysis of a wider class of models should include the @xmath169 information as well .",
    "it is important to search for as many independent constraints on a cosmological constant as possible , because each is subject to different kinds of systematic errors . at present , the best established limits on @xmath257",
    "come from gravitational lensing studies @xcite .",
    "finds that the lack of observed lensing events implies @xmath258 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "in addition , recent studies of the deceleration parameter measured in supernovae searches have placed an upper limit of @xmath259 at the @xmath260 level @xcite .",
    "the limit on the cross - correlation amplitude can also be used to constrain open models , where the correlations could be much higher for a given @xmath6 , if the x - rays probe at high enough redshifts @xcite .",
    "the constraints on open models thus are likely to be much more sensitive to assumptions of the luminousity evolution of the sources than the cosmological constant constraints .",
    "our primary aim in this paper has been to demonstrate how correlations , or the absence of correlations , between the microwave background and deep probes of structure can lead to constraints on cosmological models .",
    "the surveys we used were not ideal for this purpose , but even so they resulted in a relevant constraint on the cosmological constant .    surveys with better angular resolution will improve the signal to to noise and thus the confidence with which we can rule out a particular cosmology . with degree scale resolution in both the temperature and x - ray maps ,",
    "the signal to noise could be improved by 50% . for the linear effect which we are considering here , little",
    "is gained by looking at maps with resolution on scales smaller than a degree or two .",
    "the cmb photons do not have time to receive a substantial shift from the time varying potential when passing through smaller fluctuations . since the correlation is restricted to large scales ,",
    "full sky maps are essential to reduce uncertainties due to accidental correlations .",
    "future satellite missions , most notably map and the planck surveyor , will provide full sky maps with sufficient resolution ( @xmath261 and @xmath262 , respectively ) to be explore this effect fully in the cmb sky . data from these probes should be available in the next 5 - 10 years .",
    "the prospects for better data for the x - ray sky in the near future are uncertain .",
    "the rosat survey is sensitive only at lower energies ( @xmath263 kev ) and so is likely to be contaminated by galactic and other foregrounds . to search for this effect ,",
    "ideally one needs a full sky survey of the hard xrb ( 2 - 10 kev ) which has degree scale resolution and which is sensitive enough to allow an unambiguous subtraction of poisson fluctuations .",
    "such a survey would also provide a measurement of structure on scales larger than is possible in current optical surveys and would fill in the gap in the power spectrum which lies between the galactic surveys and the measurements of the microwave background .",
    "this kind of mission is now being considered ( k. jahoda , private communication ) .",
    "one can also consider looking at other possible probes of structure at high red shifts .",
    "the formalism for calculating the correlations presented here for x - rays transfers easily to other kinds of probes .",
    "possibilities include surveys of radio galaxies or quasars , or other objects which probe to large redshifts .",
    "galaxy surveys such as the sloane dss , which should probe to @xmath264 , might also be sensitive to this effect and have the added benefit of containing redshift information for the individual sources .",
    "an advantage of these probes is that their large scale clustering properties are ( or will be ) known and the bias implied by a given model can be easily computed .",
    "however , if the surface density of these objects is too low ( e.g. quasars ) then the statistical noise in the cross - correlation function will be large and the effects discussed in this paper will be unobservable .",
    "in this paper we have focused on testing for a cosmological constant , but in fact this is a rather indirect means of testing for @xmath257 .",
    "the results we quote are based on a fairly specific model , one which has cold dark matter as well as adiabatic , scale invariant initial fluctuations .",
    "it is important to realize however that rather than being sensitive merely to one specific cosmological model , the effect we have considered occurs in any cosmology where the gravitational potential has evolved recently .",
    "this includes models that are open or where structures arise from cosmological defects and we are presently working to understand this constraint in these other contexts .    whatever the cosmological model , the isw effect reflects important fundamental information relevant to structure formation .",
    "the presence of large , empty voids , the apparent lack of mergers and the shapes of clusters of galaxies provide evidence , tentative as yet , that the process of structure formation might be slowing down .",
    "if this is the case , then the decay of the linear gravitational potential makes a late time isw effect inevitable and offers an important observation to confront these other clues about how structures formed in the universe .",
