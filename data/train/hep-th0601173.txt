    "in the past ten years , heterotic m - theory has provided an exciting arena in which to analyse the cosmology and particle physics of our universe  @xcite .",
    "representing the low - energy limit of the strongly - coupled heterotic @xmath4 string , this theory not only combines gravitational , particle and braneworld physics into one unified description , but also possesses a detailed and constrained field - content that can not be arbitrarily adjusted .",
    "therefore , it retains a definitive and unambiguous relationship to m - theory itself .",
    "however , in the @xmath5 supergravity description of heterotic m - theory , a number of important questions still remain unanswered .",
    "consider , for example , the simple cosmological situation that occurs when we retain only the dilaton @xmath6 , the universal @xmath7 modulus , and the field @xmath8 describing a single m5 brane . despite the fact that this leads to vanishing superpotential in four dimensions , the resulting cosmology is highly non - linear and demonstrates quite unexpected behaviour . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath9 cosmology was analysed in a truncated limit with all axion fields removed .",
    "it was then shown that the scalar corresponding to the m5 brane position _ must _ be included in the set of cosmologically significant fields , and this leads to a forcing effect whereby the ambient dimensions change size as the brane moves .",
    "moreover , the frictional forces acting back on the brane are such that it accelerates and then decelerates back to rest , mimicking a time - dependent force of finite duration .",
    "this illustrates the unconventional effect of non - standard kinetic terms in the theory , and the means by which the brane can undergo a single displacement by exchanging energy with its environment . in the special situation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite this effect can be described exactly using the toda formalism @xcite , and the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is an @xmath3 toda model .",
    "given this behaviour , it is interesting to consider whether more complicated trajectories for the m5 brane are possible .",
    "for example , not all of the scalar fields were considered in the @xmath3 toda model of ref .",
    "@xcite , since the axionic fields were consistently truncated away .",
    "this means that only a portion of the full solution - space was explored , and that the @xmath3 behaviour is liable to be only an approximation once the axions are restored .",
    "therefore , following on from the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , we wish to analyse situations in which additional axionic fields are evolving in conjunction with the brane , and determine whether interesting new behaviours for the m5 brane can occur .",
    "in particular , we wish to determine whether an m5 brane can undergo multiple displacements , and even reverse direction in the absence of explicit potentials .    before embarking on the detailed calculations , we first summarise our results .",
    "we uncover a new and exact @xmath2 toda model , in which the m5 brane can undergo two successive displacements in the same direction .",
    "that is , the brane spontaneously accelerates twice in response to the other moduli fields to which it is coupled . applying the symmetries derived in our companion paper ref .",
    "@xcite to this model , as well as to the known @xmath3 model of ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain two additional sets of new solutions . in the symmetry - transformed @xmath2 case",
    "the brane can undergo two successive displacements in _ opposite _ directions , and so reverse direction and `` bounce '' without the presence of any explicit potentials in the action .",
    "this effect occurs purely through the interaction of non - standard kinetic terms , via the cross - couplings of the various fields , and constitutes an exact supergravity solution that has been rigorously deduced from m - theory .",
    "finally we investigate the generation of density perturbations in these models , and show that heterotic m - theory possesses a scale - invariant isocurvature mode in some of the axion fields .",
    "this last result is consistent with the original findings of the pre big bang scenario @xcite and in agreement with the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was first shown that the moving brane itself could not generate a scale - invariant perturbation spectrum .",
    "following a conclusion , in an appendix we present the technical details of the @xmath2 toda model derivation .",
    "we now review the @xmath5 supergravity action presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . recall that this was derived via a compactification of 11d supergravity on the orbifold @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes a calabi - yau three - fold .",
    "this leads to two four - dimensional boundary planes separated along a fifth dimension .",
    "if the fifth dimension is labelled by a normalised coordinate @xmath12 $ ] , then the boundaries reside at @xmath13 respectively and have the charges @xmath14 . a single m5 brane is also included in the space , by wrapping it on a holomorphic 2-cycle of the @xmath11 .",
    "the brane then appears as a three - brane of charge @xmath15 that lies parallel to the boundaries , and which can move along the interval .",
    "importantly , the interaction between the boundaries and brane leads to the existence of a static , triple - domain wall bps solution .",
    "one can then consider further reducing on this solution , so as to find a supergravity theory describing slowly varying fluctuations about the static bps vacuum .",
    "this contains the six scalar fields @xmath16 with the following non - standard kinetic terms @xmath17\\label{4daction } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each of these scalars has an underlying significance in terms of the @xmath18 parent theory from which it descends .",
    "the scalar @xmath19 is the zero - mode of the @xmath20 component in the @xmath18 metric , and measures the separation between the boundaries .",
    "specifically , the separation is given by @xmath21 in terms of some dimensionful reference size @xmath22 .",
    "the field @xmath23 represents the orbifold - averaged calabi - yau volume , such that the physical size is given by @xmath24 in terms of a dimensionful reference volume @xmath25 .",
    "the scalars @xmath26 originate from the bulk three - form and graviphoton field respectively .",
    "the field @xmath27 measures the position of the bulk brane between the boundaries , with the points @xmath13 corresponding to the boundaries .",
    "lastly , the field @xmath28 arises from the self - dual two - form on the brane worldvolume .",
    "this reduction on a bps solution guarantees that the scalars must group into supersymmetric multiplets described by a supersymmetric action .",
    "one can verify that they naturally fall into the pairs @xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 , which are the bosonic components of chiral superfields @xmath9 as follows @xmath32 this naturally leads to a khler manifold expression for the scalar part of the action @xmath33 where the superfields are grouped into a coordinate vector @xmath34 , with the complex conjugate coordinates denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "the khler metric @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 in terms of the khler potential @xmath38 -3\\ln\\left(t+\\overline{t}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this khler potential is computed only to linear - order in the two parameters @xmath39 @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the eleven - dimensional newton constant , and @xmath43 are the dimensionful scales mentioned above .",
    "the two conditions @xmath44 then restrict the accessible regions of moduli - space in which we can trust the four - dimensional effective theory .",
    "in addition , the supergravity action eq .   can only be trusted in the limit where stringy @xmath45 corrections are suitably small , as these corrections introduce higher - derivative terms that we have disregarded .",
    "we now turn to the equations of the motion arising from the action eq .  .",
    "if we assume a spatially flat friedmann robertson walker ( frw ) cosmology for the four - dimensional spacetime , then the metric takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 , the scale - factor is @xmath48 , and @xmath49 represents a gauge freedom in the choice of time coordinate . denoting a @xmath50 derivative by an overdot , and assuming all fields are purely functions of @xmath50 , one obtains the einstein field equations @xmath51    the @xmath52 equations of motion @xmath53e^{3\\alpha - n } \\right\\}e^{n-3\\alpha } -2\\dot{\\nu}(\\dot{\\sigma}+4qz\\dot{\\nu})e^{-2\\phi } & = 0 \\ ] ]    and the @xmath54 equations of motion @xmath55e^{3\\alpha - n } \\ : \\right\\ } & = 0\\\\ \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left\\ { \\left [ z(\\dot{\\sigma}+4qz\\dot{\\nu})e^{-2\\phi } + 2(\\dot{\\nu}-\\chi\\dot{z})e^{-\\beta-\\phi }",

    "firstly , we search for specialised solutions that occur when the equations are truncated , usually by setting certain combinations of fields to zero .",
    "this will allow us to recover the known @xmath3 toda model of ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as a previously undiscovered @xmath2 toda model .",
    "secondly , we will utilise the scalar - field symmetry transformations that were derived in our recent companion paper ref .",
    "that is , we will apply these symmetry transformations to the fields of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 toda models in turn , and so derive two new solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "we will find that in these new solutions the m5 brane can evolve in far more complicated ways than has previously been seen .",
    "we now briefly recall the behaviour of the @xmath3 toda model found in ref .",
    "this will prove useful because the @xmath3 model exhibits features that persist in all the solutions we will present , and so will illuminate the discussions to come .",
    "in addition , it is worthwhile studying this model in order to understand how symmetry - transformations will affect it .",
    "the @xmath3 model can be derived by choosing the axions to satisfy @xmath56 .",
    "the remaining fields @xmath57 can then be solved for exactly , essentially due to the fact that the field @xmath27 satisfies the conservation law @xmath58 namely , inserting this result back into the remaining equations of motion yields a closed set of equations in @xmath59 which can be solved in isolation . in particular ,",
    "these equations can be reformulated in terms of the motion of a `` particle '' with coordinates @xmath60 which roams over a three - dimensional space and experiences an exponential potential @xmath61 .",
    "these equations take the form @xmath62 which can be derived by variation of @xmath63 from the simpler particle lagrangian @xmath64 here we have defined a moduli - space metric @xmath65 of minkowski signature , and a particle - worldline metric @xmath66 where is a dimension vector that gives the number of spatial dimensions associated to the scale - factor @xmath67",
    ". the function @xmath68 thus encodes the arbitrary choice of time parameterisation of the worldline , with its variation in the lagrangian naturally producing an energy conservation constraint .",
    "finally , the moduli - space potential @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a positive constant .",
    "up to a constant length rescaling , the vector @xmath72 defines the single , simple root - vector of the lie algebra @xmath3 , and so the lagrangian eq",
    ".   defines an @xmath3 toda model .",
    "this is an exactly integrable system , and in the proper - time gauge @xmath73 one finds the general solution : @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 here the subscript @xmath77 takes the values @xmath78 , and the scalar product @xmath79 is defined by @xmath80 .",
    "note that the constraints in eq .   must be enforced so that eqs .",
    "- are indeed the correct field solutions .",
    "once this is done , the solution describes a transition between two asymptotically free - field states .",
    "that is , the initial field velocities are equal to the `` expansion power '' constants @xmath81 , the final field velocities are equal to the constants @xmath82 , and the nonsupersymmetric second term in eq .",
    "forces a smooth acceleration between these `` rolling - radii '' ( rr ) regimes .",
    "in fact , the underlying reason for this @xmath83 interpolation is the motion of the brane itself , which according to eq .",
    "is at rest in the extreme limits , but borrows kinetic energy from @xmath84 and moves significantly at the intermediate time @xmath85 . for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we now present the explicit form of the solutions by inserting the various vector quantities .",
    "this gives @xmath86 these are subject to the relations @xmath87 as well as the `` ellipse '' constraint @xmath88 notice , in fact , that if we enforce the constraint that fixes @xmath89 in terms of @xmath90 then the final expansion powers @xmath89 are automatically guaranteed to lie on the same ellipse .",
    "the interpretation of this ellipse condition is relatively simple , and can be illustrated in a phase - plane diagram as follows .",
    "consider drawing a 2d plot where the horizontal axis corresponds to @xmath91 ( with @xmath92 ) and the vertical axis to @xmath93 .",
    "then the constants @xmath94 , where @xmath78 , are the asymptotic values of @xmath91 and @xmath95 .",
    "thus , they correspond to the values attained in the plane at the extreme endpoints of the phase - plane trajectory .",
    "hence , according to eq .   and",
    "the constraints , the trajectory traced out in the phase - plane must begin and end at two different points on a single , fixed ellipse drawn in that plane .",
    "these phase - plane plots , or `` ellipse diagrams '' as we shall call them , will prove to be extremely useful in exhibiting the behaviour of the system diagrammatically .",
    "this is because the shape and curves of the trajectories in these diagrams tell us very graphically about the brane motion and changes to the axions .      to exhibit the behaviour of the fields",
    ", we now plot an ellipse diagram .",
    "this proves to be far more intuitive and useful than following the behaviour of all fields individually . before doing this",
    ", we must recognise that the solutions in eq .",
    "are valid over two disconnected time ranges given by @xmath96 where the time @xmath97 corresponds to a curvature singularity . consequently , there are two different notions of `` early '' and `` late '' built into the solutions , depending on the choice of branch . for example , although @xmath98 corresponds to a _",
    "past _ singularity in the @xmath99 branch , it corresponds to a _ future _ singularity from the perspective of the @xmath100 branch .",
    "the @xmath100 branch is , in fact , an example of a pre big bang ( pbb ) era , which is automatically undergoing superluminal deflation .",
    "therefore , to avoid confusion we must always pick a particular branch , and take care with what constitutes early and late behaviour .",
    "in particular , the @xmath101 constants only correspond to an `` initial '' set of expansion powers as implied by the subscript if they satisfy @xmath102 that is , only those powers satisfying this condition can ever be early time states of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : su2ellipse ] we have plotted some representative trajectories on the @xmath100 branch .",
    "note that the fields @xmath84 start at a single point on the ellipse , with their initial powers corresponding to that sector with @xmath103 . on the negative branch this `` early '' time state corresponds to the infinitely negative past @xmath104 .",
    "the fields then evolve such that the effective trajectory in the plane is a straight line .",
    "this linear behaviour is a consequence of the relation @xmath105 , and this in turn is possible because all the axions have been truncated away .",
    "the trajectory then ends on the opposite sector of the ellipse , ending up in a `` late '' time state as @xmath106 from below .",
    "this directed evolution between parts of the ellipse can not be reversed unless we switch the branch from @xmath100 to @xmath99 , so the accessible early - time states of the system are fixed by the choice of the branch .",
    "thus , interesting physical results will sometimes necessitate choosing one branch over another .",
    "_ figure to show the linear mapping across the ellipse , with the direction fixed by the choice of time branch .",
    "if we pick a candidate set of expansion powers satisfying @xmath103 , then these are indeed available early - time states on the @xmath100 branch . states satisfying @xmath107 are not available at early time ; instead , they are the late time states that the system evolves into .",
    "this is all reversed on the @xmath99 branch._,width=226 ]    to complete this section , we now comment on the validity of these @xmath3 toda solutions . recall that the four - dimensional action eq .",
    "is known only as a power series , with five - dimensional gravitational corrections measured in powers of the @xmath39 ( @xmath108 ) . in the above model",
    "one finds that @xmath109 this divergence is due to the fact that the coupling of the bulk brane to @xmath84 is itself proportional to the @xmath39 , so that when the brane moves the system is necessarily driven to a five - dimensional limit in both asymptotic regimes .",
    "this will cause the four - dimensional theory to break down , and with it the solutions eq .  .",
    "this divergence is in fact familiar from pbb cosmology where the addition of the dilatonic axion to the dilaton - moduli system causes the same problem .",
    "a more insidious problem , however , is that even at intermediate times one can not make @xmath110 whilst simultaneously fitting the entire @xmath27 displacement profile within the physical orbifold extent @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "say , for example , that we search for the minimum value of the @xmath39 parameters .",
    "one can verify that this occurs at precisely the time @xmath112 , and at this time the ellipse trajectory intersects the line @xmath113 .",
    "the magnitude at the minimum is then @xmath114    evidently , @xmath115 is now required in order to make this small .",
    "having made this choice , there will be a finite period of time , depending on the value of @xmath116 , where the @xmath117 are small and our solutions , eq .",
    ", are valid .",
    "this period ends with the rapid collision of the brane with the boundary which , of course , also invalidates the above analytical solutions .",
    "( for a discussion of the evolution after the collision see ref .",
    "the limitations on the validity of these solutions , both due to the @xmath117 constraint and brane - boundary collision , may be viewed as a disadvantage and one may ask whether other solutions with a larger range of validity exist .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case for some of the new solutions to be discussed below .",
    "after reviewing the @xmath3 model at some length , we will now present an entirely new @xmath2 solution .",
    "this proves to be significantly more complicated than the @xmath3 toda model , as we might expect from the fact that the lie group @xmath2 is more complicated in structure than @xmath3 .",
    "we will find that the @xmath2 solutions are fundamentally controlled by two influences , one due to the motion of the m5 brane and the other due to changes in @xmath118 .",
    "this leads to new , characteristic trajectories in the ellipse diagrams .",
    "in particular , the coupling between @xmath27 and @xmath118 allows the m5 brane to undergo two successive displacements in the same direction .",
    "this generalises the behaviour of the old @xmath3 case , and demonstrates that the brane can undergo repetitious displacement behaviour .      to derive the @xmath2 toda model ,",
    "one chooses the axions to satisfy @xmath119 this effectively sets two of the terms in the action to zero for all time , without forcing any of the fields or their derivatives to be _ individually _ zero . to see that this corresponds to an @xmath2 toda model",
    "we impose eq .  , and note that the @xmath27 and @xmath118 equations are now total derivatives @xmath120= \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left[e^{-2\\beta+3\\alpha - n}\\dot{\\chi}\\right]=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these can be immediately integrated to give constants of the motion . inserting these conservation laws back into the remaining equations of motion then yields a closed set of equations in @xmath59 that can again be derived from the particle lagrangian @xmath121 the quantities @xmath122 remain unchanged from the @xmath3 toda model , but the potential is modified to @xmath123 , with @xmath124 this means that the effective particle motion of is now subjected to _ two _ exponential forces . to be a toda model",

    "it transpires that the @xmath149 solution involves a non - elementary integral , and so can not be presented analytically .",
    "however , its behaviour can always be computed numerically . on the other hand , the field @xmath28 takes the simple form @xmath150 subject to the conditions @xmath151    interestingly , the field @xmath28 can reverse field - velocity midway through its evolution , and so `` turn - around '' or `` bounce '' .",
    "this peculiar effect will have important ramifications when we transform the @xmath2 solutions later on , for it will allow the brane field @xmath27 to bounce as well .",
    "there are two distinct @xmath3 models embedded non - trivially in these solutions .",
    "if we take the limit @xmath152 then the early - time behaviour of the fields is formally identical to the solutions eq .   of the previous section",
    "if instead we reverse the temporal sequence by choosing @xmath153 then the early time behaviour is another three - field @xmath3 model involving @xmath118 as the axion .",
    "these two models are _ not _ decoupled as they would be in the @xmath154 toda case , but instead are non - trivially mixed inside the @xmath2 model . only in extreme cases can we discern the underlying @xmath3 components , and so at a general , intermediate time there will not be a clean separation of the effects of the @xmath27 and @xmath118 motions .",
    "indeed , these two embedded behaviours couple and compete with one another , and attempt to drive the expansion powers according to the two conflicting processes @xmath155 in general , this means that neither @xmath134 nor @xmath156 individually succeed in becoming the actual expansion powers that the system adopts at late - time .",
    "however , the system may spend some part of its evolution at _ intermediate _ rolling - radii states where it adopts these powers temporarily .",
    "the true late - time rolling - radii states @xmath157 are in fact determined from a `` combined '' relation given by @xmath158 notice that the final states are computed _ as if _ the system followed an ordinary @xmath3 model with a combined parameter @xmath159 . however , the intermediate behaviour strongly deviates from any such simple @xmath3 evolution , and we should treat eq .   merely as a formal tool for deducing the rolling - radii endpoints of the trajectory .    to see this clearly , we plot the field behaviour on the ellipse as we did in section  [ sec : su2 ] ( see fig .

    "consequently , the @xmath2 solutions can not be trusted asymptotically , as with the previous @xmath3 solutions of section  [ sec : su2 ] .",
    "further investigation of eq .   also reveals that it can never be made smaller than the leading coefficient , which is of order @xmath167 .",
    "this demonstrates that the smallest attainable value of the @xmath39 is given by @xmath168 hence , to achieve @xmath169 the solutions require us to take @xmath170 and allow the brane to leave the orbifold interval . as such",
    ", the @xmath2 model has similar problems to the @xmath3 model .",
    "of course , as long as we are interested in relatively short timescales , and always concentrate on the brane behaviour inside of the interval but away from the boundaries ( and the collision ) then no particular problem is posed .",
    "away from the boundaries the @xmath2 solutions with @xmath170 are reliable for a short time , and the fact that the brane must _ eventually _ leave the interval does not change this fact . hence , there are always regions where all fields are evolving in an @xmath169 regime with the brane inside the interval",
    ".    however , it would obviously be valuable if these regions could be extended to cover the entire displacement profile of the brane , such that the brane moves and comes to rest while remaining inside the interval with @xmath169 throughout .",
    "although this is impossible with the @xmath2 solutions themselves , when we come to symmetry - transform the @xmath2 solutions we will find circumstances under which @xmath171 and @xmath172 simultaneously .",

    "the seven - dimensional symmetry group @xmath173 is a maximal parabolic subgroup of @xmath174 given by @xmath175 where @xmath176 denotes a semidirect product .",
    "the scalar - field space is then the group manifold @xmath177 , but equipped with a nonhomogeneous riemannian metric such that the total symmetry group fills out only @xmath173 and not the whole of @xmath174 .",
    "there are seven , distinct types of transformations @xmath178 that can be applied to the scalar fields , each one controlled by a continuously adjustable real constant @xmath179 .",
    "these are given by    @xmath180    some of these transformations will simply amount to reparameterisations of the existing integration constants in the solutions they are applied to . some , however , change the solutions into new functional forms , which will in turn be completely new solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "in particular , note that @xmath181 represent the @xmath182 group of transformations , which act on @xmath9 as follows @xmath183 here the four constants @xmath184 ( subject to one constraint ) are proportional to @xmath185 , and are better adapted to the @xmath182 symmetry . in particular , they can be considered the four entries of a @xmath186 @xmath182 matrix .",

    "nonetheless , the action on @xmath7 alone is indistinguishable from conventional @xmath7-duality , and so all - told we will dub this a `` generalised '' @xmath7-duality .",
    "these generalised @xmath7-duality transformations can produce exceedingly complicated new behaviours , and can significantly affect any existing time - dependent solutions that they are applied to .",
    "consequently , we can expect to derive new solutions to the equations of motion by transforming the @xmath3 and @xmath2 models using these symmetries . while it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the symmetries do not form a transitive group on @xmath187 , so that we can not use them to build the _ general _ solution to the equations of motion , we can nonetheless make significant progress in this direction .",
    "we now apply the finite symmetries @xmath178 to the @xmath3 model . only @xmath188 have a non - trivial effect , and they modify the system such that it is no longer a simple toda model that can be solved using the toda methodology .",

    "we can arrange for the @xmath27 motion to occur in a @xmath194 region with @xmath171 . to do this",
    ", we simply recognise that at @xmath195 we can always take @xmath196 , and this will decrease the values of the @xmath39 below 1 without requiring @xmath170 .",
    "consequently , there is a tremendous degree of flexibility in the solutions , and cases with @xmath169 and @xmath171 are quite generic .    before leaving this section",
    ", we should also comment on stringy @xmath45 corrections .",
    "these become strong as we probe small length scales at @xmath197 , and so encounter new physics not accounted for in the effective supergravity description . as such",
    ", one must always ensure that @xmath198 to trust any supergravity solution .",
    "we note that this is always possible for certain periods of time by an appropriate choice of integration constants , and so there is no obstruction to finding regimes where @xmath169 and @xmath45 corrections are extremely small .",
    "the transformed @xmath3 solutions thus incorporate all of the @xmath27 behaviour from the @xmath3 model , but now allow it to be compressed inside of the orbifold interval whilst simultaneously suppressing all unwanted corrections .",
    "we now apply the symmetries @xmath178 to the @xmath2 solutions , and so find a further class of new solutions .",
    "one finds in this case that only the action of the @xmath199 transformation can ever lead to new behaviour .",
    "this can be easily understood by noting that all the other transformations leave the @xmath2 truncation conditions eq .",
    "invariant , while @xmath199 allows @xmath200 to become non - zero .",
    "the `` activation '' of this combination takes us outside of the original @xmath2 toda model , and into a new situation that is not itself solvable by toda methods .",
    "nonetheless , the symmetries allow us to access an exact , analytical description of the behaviour when this combination is non - zero .",
    "we will find that the brane can undergo two displacements in opposite directions , and so reverse direction without the presence of any explicit potentials .",
    "we will often call this a `` bouncing '' solution .      these new solutions , although exact , are complicated and difficult to present in an elegant fashion .",
    "one means of presentation is to utilise two time - dependent functions @xmath201 that are implicitly defined via the relations @xmath202 these are built out of the @xmath203 solutions from the old ( untransformed ) @xmath2 model .",

    "the remaining constants , it should be emphasised , are taken from the original @xmath2 model , and we should treat their values as determining an embedding of the old @xmath2 behaviour inside the newly transformed solutions .",
    "indeed , the fields @xmath207 are unaffected by the transformations , and evolve as in the old @xmath2 case in any event .",
    "notice as well that we can not present @xmath149 analytically , due to the fact that the corresponding @xmath2 solution can only be computed numerically .",
    "as such , the transformed @xmath149 solution must also be computed numerically .",
    "however , we emphasise that these numerical computations can be readily carried out with no obstruction , and that the symmetry transformations induce perfectly sensible behaviour for @xmath149 in all cases . in addition , @xmath149 can have no bearing on the time - development of the other fields , as the condition @xmath208 is preserved under the symmetry group eq .  .",
    "this means that @xmath149 never appears in the equations of motion of the other fields , and so can never induce any changes to the brane or remaining axions .",
    "consequently , we will not particularly concern ourselves with @xmath149 from this point on .",
    "having derived these new solutions by applying the symmetries , we must now consider the ramifications for the various fields involved .",
    "in particular , we are most interested in the field @xmath27 and the issue of whether we can now achieve a sensible displacement at weak - coupling . in the original @xmath2 model",
    "the field @xmath27 could undergo two successive displacements in the same direction , but it could not do so whilst entirely within a @xmath169 regime . in the above case , however , the new field @xmath27 is an additive mixture of the old @xmath2 behaviours for @xmath209 .",
    "this creates a significant new level of flexibility , and in the next section we will investigate the consequences for the brane and its displacements .      due to the complexity of the solutions ,",
    "the field behaviour is somewhat difficult to determine by mere inspection .",
    "however , one can verify that the symmetry - transformation does not affect the asymptotic development , and so the same set of states are accessed on the ellipse at early and late time as in the @xmath2 model .",
    "however , the intermediate evolution is substantially , and interestingly , different . in fig .",
    "[ fig : su3trans2 ] we plot some examples on the ellipse .",
    "the particularly interesting feature of these new solutions is the motion of the brane .",
    "specifically , for certain special choices of constants , the brane can `` bounce '' and spontaneously reverse direction midway through its evolution .",
    "moreover , a thorough investigation of the parameter space reveals that it is possible to make @xmath210 whilst @xmath27 is undergoing this bounce strictly inside the orbifold interval .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : su3trans2brane ] .    to see that this behaviour is indeed a consequence of the solutions in eq .",
    ", one can proceed in the following qualitative fashion .",
    "first , we recognise that the effect of the symmetry transformation is to switch - on the combination @xmath200 to a non - zero value .",
    "this then acts as a driving force that modifies the original @xmath2 evolution of @xmath27 .",
    "secondly , we recognise that this `` modification '' , at a practical level , amounts to additively mixing the @xmath2 behaviours of @xmath27 and @xmath28 together ( see eq .  ) .",
    "so not only is @xmath27 affected , but it is affected by a non - trivial mixing together with the behaviour of @xmath28 .",
    "thirdly , the original @xmath2 field @xmath28 can _ already _ be made to reverse direction for particular choices of constants ( see eq .  ) . hence",
    ", once mixed , the transformed @xmath27 solution _ also _ inherits this bouncing behaviour .    as before , this behaviour is subject to @xmath45 corrections . however , the strength of these corrections can always be adjusted such that , when the brane is bouncing , the corrections are extremely small and so under control .",
    "of course , the corrections can not be made arbitrarily small for _ all _ time , but they can always be made arbitrarily small over significant periods of time when the brane is moving . to achieve this one simply tunes @xmath211 , which has the effect of setting @xmath198 in the vicinity of the bounce .",
    "these bouncing solutions richly extend the results of the previous sections .",
    "we now see that the effective supergravity action eq .   admits exact solutions where the brane evolves in a regime with @xmath169 , has small @xmath45 corrections , is strictly between the boundaries , and",
    "can also reverse direction mid - course .",
    "these effects were not at all obvious from the exactly integrable @xmath3 and @xmath2 toda models , and yet can be generated by judiciously applying symmetries of the equations of motion .",
    "we also reiterate that no explicit potential was required to induce these effects ; the reversal is a natural outcome of the non - linearly coupled cosmology .",
    "in the previous section we presented several new classes of cosmological solution to heterotic m - theory , and found that the four - dimensional scale - factor @xmath212 always satisfies @xmath213 . switching to conformal time @xmath214 defined by @xmath215 , this translates into latexmath:[$a\\sim    we always have an expanding , decelerating universe , whilst on the @xmath100 branch we always have a contracting , inflationary universe .",
    "this behaviour is to be expected , for the cosmology we are studying has no explicit potentials and so @xmath217 remains unaffected by the other fields .",
    "we will now consider in more detail the inflationary epoch and the generation of perturbations on the @xmath100 branch .",
    "as with the familiar pbb scenarios , the inflationary period on the @xmath100 branch is characterised by a comoving hubble length @xmath218 that decreases as we take @xmath219 and approach the big bang singularity from below . consequently , a given comoving scale starting inside the hubble radius as @xmath220 automatically becomes larger than the hubble radius as @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , on the @xmath100 branch one can produce super - horizon scale perturbations merely from kinetic - driven inflation , without the use of any potentials .",
    "this is considered an interesting alternative to conventional inflation on the @xmath99 branch , since pbb scenarios do not require special choices of potential or slow - roll conditions .",
    "given this , it is interesting to consider the perturbation spectra of our fields on the @xmath100 branch , and see whether there any useful scale - invariant modes",
    ". not surprisingly , we will be able to utilise the techniques developed in pbb cosmology to aid our calculations .",
    "we will also see that the factor of @xmath222 in the kinetic terms for @xmath19 and @xmath118 , which complicated the classification of the scalar - field manifold ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) has interesting consequences for the spectral indices of the fields .",
    "we will begin by considering perturbations around a special background where the axions @xmath223 have been set to constants , and where the conserved quantity in eq .",
    "has been set to zero . in this case",
    "the brane @xmath27 remains static for all time , and entirely decouples from the equations of motion of @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "the fields @xmath224 then exhibit standard rolling - radii behaviour with unrestricted parameters , and no transitions on the ellipse occur .",
    "although this special `` vacuum '' situation does not incorporate any interesting brane displacements in the background , it proves to be a much simpler situation that can be solved analytically .",
    "later , we will comment on perturbations around more general backgrounds , including the various toda models and their symmetry transforms . in the meantime",
    ", we note that in the simple vacuum case the @xmath19 and @xmath23 perturbations remain coupled to the metric perturbations , and produce adiabatic perturbations with the same steep @xmath225 blue spectra that occurs in pbb cosmology  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fields @xmath226 with constant background values are decoupled from the metric perturbations , and produce isocurvature perturbations @xmath227 with different spectra .    the first - order , gauge - invariant perturbation equations for @xmath228 in conformal time",
    "are given by @xmath229 here a @xmath230 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath214 , and @xmath231 is the comoving wavenumber of the perturbation . in order to solve for these four isocurvature perturbations we will use techniques familiar from the pbb literature , with @xmath27 replacing an axion .",
    "this involves making an appropriate conformal transformation on the metric into each axion s frame so as to eliminate the coupling to @xmath84 , and then solving the resulting perturbation equations in the usual manner ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , before we do this we need to deal with the awkward source terms on the right - hand sides of eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "the presence of the bulk - brane field @xmath27 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    ", rather than a true axion , slightly complicates the situation as we can not simply set @xmath232 as we can with @xmath118 in eq .  .",
    "recall that our theory is only valid when @xmath233 .",
    "instead , we must deal with the source terms by choosing appropriate combinations of perturbations : @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",

    "our conformal factors @xmath239 are explicitly given by @xmath240 these conformal transformations lead to a different scale factor @xmath241 in each frame , depending on each fields coupling to @xmath84 .",
    "as we are considering static axions and bulk brane , @xmath84 behave as simple rolling - radii fields with fixed parameters that lie at one point on the ellipse , eq .",
    ", for all time . that label the initial and final rolling - radii powers , as the fields @xmath84 remain in the same rolling - radii states for all time .",

    "( see , for example , the variety of dilaton - moduli - axion systems discussed in refs .",
    "this change is a direct consequence of the coupling of our fields to @xmath19 , which unlike in pbb cosmology has a factor of @xmath222 in its kinetic term .",
    "this then affects the range of @xmath267 through the ellipse condition .",

    "however , it is certainly true that all of the solutions we have considered will _ asymptotically approach _ the `` vacuum '' scenario . moreover ,",
    "when one applies the constraints on @xmath280 in the various classes of solutions one finds that , in a least one of the asymptotic limits , the rolling - radii regime which leads to @xmath269 producing a scale - invariant spectrum is accessible .",
    "hence , we can always generate a scale - invariant mode in one of the asymptotic limits , even if we can not determine whether such a mode can also be generated at intermediate times .",

    "the only previously known solution to this lagrangian , as described in ref .",

    "we have identified three new solutions in addition to this @xmath3 toda solution .",
    "the first new solution was found by consistently truncating @xmath282 to the different form @xmath285 using the conditions @xmath286 . by switching off these two terms",

    "this @xmath2 model allows for _ double _ displacements of the brane @xmath27 , and the @xmath2 solutions can always be made reliable with @xmath169 over a certain period of time during this double displacement .",
    "however , the brane must leave the compact space in any solution that has reliable @xmath169 regime at some point .",
    "next , we applied to the @xmath3 and @xmath2 models the symmetry transformations derived and discussed in our companion ref .",
    "this enabled us to derive two new and distinct cosmological solutions . the properties of these new solutions",
    "were then discussed at length , and it was found that the reliability of the solutions had been radically affected .",
    "this is ultimately due to the @xmath182 subgroup of symmetries , which acts as a `` generalised '' set of @xmath7-duality transformations given by @xmath288 this is not ordinary @xmath7-duality , as all _ three _ complex fields @xmath289 are affected .",
    "using these symmetries , it was then found in the @xmath3-transformed solutions that the brane can undergo a single displacement entirely within the orbifold interval with @xmath169 throughout .",

    "the equations of motion arising from the reduced lagrangian @xmath294 have been completely solved in this paper .",
    "further , by tuning the sign and magnitude of the @xmath295 contribution generated by the symmetry application , one can modify the overall velocity of the brane so that it comes to rest and reverses direction .",
    "this is a particularly interesting feature arising from the coupling with @xmath118 , whose presence in the kinetic term @xmath296 is due to the need for a gauge - covariant derivative in five dimensions .",
    "this reversing behaviour , which we have occasionally called a `` bouncing '' solution , can also be made to occur entirely within the orbifold interval with @xmath169 throughout .",
    "as such , all of the transformed solutions demonstrate a rich new variety of m5 brane behaviours , and new , trustworthy regions of solution space emerge that had not previously been identified .",
    "in particular , we conjecture that reversing brane solutions will exist in other corners of string theory beyond heterotic m - theory .",
    "one can pin down reasonably clear `` minimum conditions '' for this reversal to occur , as follows .",
    "firstly , at least one modulus should be active , such as the dilaton @xmath23 , whose coupling to the brane kinetic term will induce the brane @xmath27 to undergo a single displacement .",
    "secondly , there should also be an active combination proportional to a cross - coupling between an axion field and @xmath297 .",
    "this second combination can then be adjusted so that the brane turns around at some point during its motion .    as an interesting corollary",
    ", we then considered the isocurvature perturbation spectra produced by the model in an inflationary contracting ( pbb ) phase . in the `` vacuum '' case we found that one of the isocurvature modes  the one associated with the axions @xmath149 and @xmath28  is able to produce a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "furthermore , we found that _ all _ of the solutions considered will asymptotically approach this vacuum case in at least one asymptotic limit , and so a scale - invariant perturbation spectrum can always be generated asymptotically when perturbing around _ any _ of the solutions we have studied .",

    "in this appendix we present certain additional details of the @xmath2 toda model derivation .",
    "we do this because the derivation is rather complicated , particularly the manner in which one must change time - gauges and judiciously redefine constants .    to begin with ,",
    "we know that the vectors @xmath128 are proportional to the two simple root - vectors of @xmath2 .",
    "utilising this fact , we can choose a basis for the space @xmath298 that is adapted to the underlying @xmath2 symmetry , and so consists of vectors @xmath299 satisfying @xmath300 a choice of basis compatible with these conditions is given by @xmath301 we now write the covariant vector @xmath302 as the following sum @xmath303 and insert this time - dependent expansion into the equations of motion to find the evolution of the `` modes '' @xmath304 .",
    "choosing the convenient gauge @xmath305 ( or @xmath306 ) one finds @xmath307 the general solution to these equations is now easy to come by , and takes the form @xmath308 where @xmath309 are constants .",
    "the functions @xmath310 are given by a sum over the collection of weight vectors , of the fundamental @xmath311 and @xmath312 representations of @xmath2 .",
    "concretely , if we define the matrix of vectors @xmath313 then for @xmath314 the functions @xmath315 are given by @xmath316\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the positive constants @xmath317 are @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "the constant vector @xmath320 is a set of arbitrary time - shifts .",
    "the constant vector @xmath321 is restricted to the open weyl chamber , which means it is forced to have positive scalar product with the two simple root - vectors as follows @xmath322 these two conditions guarantee that @xmath323 so that the logarithms in @xmath324 are always well - defined .",
    "lastly , we must also impose the friedmann constraint @xmath325    using the information above , one can arrive at an explicit solution for the fields @xmath59 and the two additional fields @xmath163 that were integrated out . recall that @xmath326 and that @xmath327 then we find @xmath328 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad -\\ln\\left[a_{21}e^{-k_{1}\\tau+\\tau_{1}}+a_{22}e^{(k_{1}-k_{2})\\tau-(\\tau_{1}-\\tau_{2})}+ a_{23}e^{k_{2}\\tau-\\tau_{2 } } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ \\phi & = -\\frac{3}{2}\\ln\\left[a_{11}e^{-k_{2}\\tau+\\tau_{2 } } + a_{12}e^{(k_{2}-k_{1})\\tau-(\\tau_{2}-\\tau_{1})}+a_{13}e^{k_{1}\\tau-\\tau_{1 } } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ z - z_{0 } & = c_{z}\\frac{\\dot{g_{1}}}{g_{1}}= c_{z } \\left [ \\frac { -k_{2}a_{11}e^{-k_{2}\\tau+\\tau_{2}}+(k_{2}-k_{1})a_{12}e^{(k_{2}-k_{1})\\tau-(\\tau_{2}-\\tau_{1 } ) } + k_{1}a_{13}e^{k_{1}\\tau-\\tau_{1 } } } { a_{11}e^{-k_{2}\\tau+\\tau_{2 } } + a_{12}e^{(k_{2}-k_{1})\\tau-(\\tau_{2}-\\tau_{1})}+ a_{13}e^{k_{1}\\tau-\\tau_{1 } } } \\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ \\chi-\\chi_{0 } & =   c_{\\chi}\\frac{\\dot{g_{2}}}{g_{2}}= c_{\\chi}\\left[\\frac{-k_{1}a_{21}e^{-k_{1}\\tau+\\tau_{1 } } + ( k_{1}-k_{2})a_{22}e^{(k_{1}-k_{2})\\tau-(\\tau_{1}-\\tau_{2 } ) } k_{2}a_{23}e^{k_{2}\\tau-\\tau_{2 } } } { a_{21}e^{-k_{1}\\tau+\\tau_{1 } }   + a_{22}e^{(k_{1}-k_{2})\\tau-(\\tau_{1}-\\tau_{2 } ) } + a_{23}e^{k_{2}\\tau-\\tau_{2 } } } \\right ] \\nonumber \\label{eq : toda_sols}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath329 are constants of integration , and @xmath330 we can then deduce the forms of @xmath331 that are compatible with the ancillary conditions eq .   @xmath332 \\\\ \\sigma-\\sigma_{0}&= -2q\\left[2z_{0}\\nu + \\chi_{0}(z - z_{0})^{2 } + \\int \\left[(z - z_{0})^{2}\\right]^{\\centerdot}(\\chi-\\chi_{0})d\\tau \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath333 are two further constants of integration . notice that the integral in the @xmath149 solution is not elementary , and so can not be written as a finite ( potentially nested ) sequence of logs , exponentials and rational functions of @xmath50 .",
    "however , it can sometimes be analytically integrated for fixed choices of the arbitrary constants , and in any event has a sensible definite integral between fixed @xmath50 limits .",
    "in particular , one can compute the @xmath149 behaviour numerically for any given set of starting conditions .",
    "since @xmath335 and @xmath336 we see that the orbifold radius @xmath19 always goes from a state of expansion at early time to a state of contraction at late time .",
    "the same is true of the modulus @xmath23 that measures the orbifold - averaged calabi - yau volume .",
    "these two fields will then have some complicated intermediate transition(s ) that smoothly link these extreme limits . on the other hand , the fields @xmath27 and @xmath118 always asymptote to constants in the limits , although these constants are generally different .",
    "they too will undergo some intermediate  displacement \" consistent with the different constant field values at early and late time .",
    "we now change from logarithmic time @xmath50 to proper time @xmath337 .",
    "since the logarithmic - time gauge is given by @xmath305 , we can find the relation to proper time by integrating the defining relation @xmath338 this gives @xmath339 \\equiv \\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\left|\\frac{t - t_{0}}{t_{0}}\\right|\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath340 is a finite integration constant .",
    "this leads to two disconnected time branches corresponding to the choices @xmath341 and @xmath342 , both of which lead to a well - defined positive argument for the logarithm .",
    "the regime @xmath343 will be referred to as the `` positive - time '' or simply @xmath99 branch , whilst the sector @xmath342 will be dubbed the `` negative - time '' or simply @xmath100 branch .",
    "the physics in the time interval @xmath344 is mapped to these two regions in the following way .",
    "the early time @xmath345 regime with expanding @xmath346 corresponds to @xmath347 on the @xmath99 branch and @xmath348 on the @xmath100 branch , while the late time regime @xmath349 corresponds to @xmath350 on the @xmath99 branch and @xmath347 on the @xmath100 branch .",
    "it should be noted these two time branches in @xmath337 are physically separated by an unavoidable curvature singularity at @xmath98 , despite the fact that in the @xmath50-gauge we had only one physical region .",
    "after this gauge change , typical terms in @xmath324 will then scale as @xmath351 respectively , where @xmath352 and @xmath353    note that @xmath354 can be of either sign depending upon the sign of @xmath355 and so the choice of branch . on the _ positive _ branch we have",
    "@xmath356 so that @xmath357 .",
    "in this gauge the fields @xmath84 scale asymptotically at early - time as @xmath358 where we have defined the two constants @xmath359 the friedmann constraint eq .",
    "then reduces to the familiar ellipse condition @xmath360 moreover , the weyl chamber constraints @xmath361 translate into @xmath362 .",
    "so the positive branch is associated to @xmath107 with the further additional constraint that @xmath363 .",
    "conversely , on the _ negative _ time branch we find the opposite results , since we follow the ellipse trajectories backward .",
    "hence , we find that @xmath364",
    ".    since all the fields involved are scalars , we are now free to substitute @xmath50 in terms of @xmath337 in all the solutions .",
    "these will then be the @xmath73 forms for the solutions . to make these solutions look `` nice '' , however , one must carefully redefine certain constants .",
    "if one defines new timescales @xmath365 via",
    "@xmath366 \\quad,\\quad \\left|\\frac{t_{\\beta}}{t_{0}}\\right|^{\\delta_{\\beta } } = \\frac{a_{22}}{a_{21}}\\exp\\left[(2k_{1}-k_{2})\\tau_{0}-(2\\tau_{1}-\\tau_{2})\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      finally , we have decided to write the solution for @xmath19 so that it scales with respect to @xmath7 at early time rather than the natural choice @xmath368 , and so the ratio @xmath369 has been absorbed into the additive offset @xmath370 .",
    "this brings the @xmath19 solution closer to the old @xmath3 form and simplifies the vector notation , but at the expense of introducing the ratio @xmath369 into the constraints ."
