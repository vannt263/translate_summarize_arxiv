    "majorana modes can naturally exist in topological superconductors ( tscs).@xcite the intrinsic tsc has been predicted to exist in superconducting sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 with @xmath3-wave paring state.@xcite however , this has not yet been experimentally confirmed .",
    "recently , many efforts have been devoted to design artificial tscs.@xcite so far , most studies focus on the effective @xmath3-wave superconductors in hybrid systems with conventional @xmath0-wave superconductors in proximity to strong topological insulators,@xcite semiconductors with strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , @xcite or ferromagnetic atom chains.@xcite some attention has also been paid to the conventional @xmath0-wave superconductors coupled to quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) insulators such as topological insulators with magnetic dopants.@xcite among all the above tscs , multiple spatially overlapping majorana modes , which greatly benefit the transport properties , can only coexist in one - dimensional ( two - dimensional ) tscs belonging to class bdi @xcite ( d @xcite ) with integer topological invariant.@xcite in reality , the one - dimensional tscs in class bdi can easily reduce to the ones indexed by class d with zero or one majorana mode.@xcite as for the two - dimensional tscs in class d , the number of the majorana modes or the chern number is limited upto two.@xcite more majorana modes or larger chern numbers are limited by large chemical potential ( i.e. , very high doping ) and an overall much smaller bulk excitation gap than the proximity - induced superconducting gap.@xcite    in this work , we show that a two - dimensional tsc can be realized in a hybrid system with a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor proximity - coupled to a qah state @xcite due to the rashba soc @xcite and exchange field in single layer graphene .",
    "interestingly , with very low or even zero doping near the dirac points , i.e. , two inequivalent valleys , the tsc from the qah state has a chern number reaching as large as four , hosting four majorana edge modes .",
    "more importantly , these majorana modes are protected by a bulk excitation gap , which can be larger or even one order of magnitude larger than the superconducting gap from the proximity effect .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the case of effective @xmath3-wave superconductors where the excitation gap is always smaller than the superconducting gap.@xcite as the large topologically nontrivial gap has been shown to be probably most important for applications in topological insulators,@xcite topological crystalline insulators,@xcite and qah insulators,@xcite our finding , i.e. , reporting a large bulk excitation gap in the tsc is crucial to the field of tscs and majorana modes .",
    "this paves a way to obtain robust tscs and majorana modes using the qah states .",
    "we also address the experimental feasibility of the tsc from the qah state .",

    "the first term stands for the nearest - neighbor hopping with @xmath9ev @xcite being the hopping energy .",
