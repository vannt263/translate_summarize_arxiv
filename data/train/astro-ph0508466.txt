    "the pierre auger observatory aims at unveiling the secrets of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) through the observation of the extensive air showers ( eas ) they produce in the atmosphere .",
    "it combines four fluorescence detector ( fd ) sites with a ground array to achieve hybrid detection of the eas@xcite .",
    "the fluorescence detectors , however , operate only at night , with limited moon light contamination , affecting the statistics of the hybrid data set . to achieve high exposure ,",
    "the surface array , with an uptime close to 100% , is fundamental .",
    "an auger surface detector ( sd ) station is a 10m@xmath0 base , 1.5 m tall cylindrical rotomolded plastic tank .",
    "it encloses a tyvek^^ liner filled with locally produced purified water ( resistivity : 15m@xmath1 cm ) up to a 1.2 m level .",
    "three 9  photonis xp1805 photomultiplier tubes are used to collect the cherenkov light emitted by particles crossing the tank .",
    "signal is extracted both from the anode and the last dynode , the latter being amplified to achieve a larger final dynamic range extending from a few to about @xmath2 photoelectrons .",
    "all channels are connected to a 5 pole anti - aliasing filter with a cutoff at 20mhz , digitized at 40mhz by 10 bit fadc , a digital trigger is operated by a local cpu .",
    "timing is obtained by a gps motorola unit , and communication to the central data acquisition system ( cdas ) is done via a custom built wireless communication system .",
    "two solar panels charging two 12v batteries provide the 10w used by the electronics .",
    "each detector is therefore independent and can start operating upon installation , independently of other detectors in the array .",
    "more details about the sd can be found in @xcite .",
    "the auger surface array will consist of 1600 of these detectors , on a 3000km@xmath0 triangular grid of 1.5 km spacing . since january 2004",
    ", the array has been in stable operation and has grown at a steady rate of about 9 tanks per week .",
    "figure [ fig : array ] shows the status in june 2005 .",
    "each tank is deployed and its position is verified with differential gps technique .",
    "even if the landscape sometimes forces some displacements from the perfect triangular geometry , 50% of the tanks are at less than 5 m from the theoretical position , and 90% at less than 20 m .",

    "the environment to which an auger surface detector is exposed is somewhat hostile for the electronics . at 1400 m a.s.l . and with clear skies , day - night temperature variations are of the order of 20@xmath3c .",
    "the terrain properties vary on the 3000km@xmath0 of the array , and some detectors have to face high salinity corrosive air , while others face dusty air from sandy ground .",
    "humidity is present both in the ground ( rivers , groundwater ) and in the tank due to condensation .    to monitor the whole array",
    "accurately various sensors are installed in each tank .",
    "this information is sent to the cdas every 6 minutes .",
    "temperature is measured on each pmt base , on the electronics board , and on each battery .",
    "pmt voltage and current are also monitored , as well as solar panel voltages , individual battery voltage , and charge current .",
    "these data are used to detect a wide range of failures , from broken solar panels to discharging batteries , and correlations like unstable pmt behavior related to temperature .",
    "weather stations reporting temperature , pressure , humidity , wind speed and direction are installed at each fluorescence site and in the center of the array , to complete the environmental monitoring .",
    "these data allow extra checks such as the influence of the pressure on the calibration .",
    "the calibration is operated online every minute@xcite , and sent to cdas every 6 minutes for monitoring .",
    "a number of quantities are available to check the behavior of the tank : baseline values , single muon peak signal , single muon average charge , dynode / anode ratio , and pmt stability .",
    "in addition , high statistics histograms of the charge distribution from muons ( 150000 counts ) and average pulse shapes are sent every time a station records an event .",
    "this information allows detailed monitoring of the evolution of the calibration and various cross - checks .",
    "figure [ fig : vem ] shows the evolution of the vem ( vertical equivalent muon , average charge deposited by a vertical and central through going muon ) and its correlation with temperature for a specific detector .",
    "the online calibration takes into account most temperature fluctuations at the local trigger level as reflected in the same figure by the stability of the trigger rate over time@xcite . over the whole array , correlation of the trigger rate with temperature",
    "are -0.04@xmath40.03% per degree for first trigger level ( t1 ) , 0.08@xmath40.05% per degree for the second level trigger ( t2 ) , and 0.2@xmath40.5% per degree for the time over threshold trigger ( tot ) .",
    "the sd array therefore operates with stable trigger threshold even with 20 degrees daily temperature variations .",
    "it is clear from the plots of figure [ fig : vem ] that calibrating the array only once per day would introduce a significant bias in the trigger threshold , of the order of 10% .    .",

    "table [ tab : sde ] shows the fraction of detector in which some monitoring parameters fall outside of the expected range or exhibit large fluctuations .",
    "while this fraction is already small , it is important to remember that most of the detectors have been recently deployed and infancy problems are the major cause of improper functioning . as a reference , out of 96 pmt issues ,",
    "only 2 manifested problems after 18 months of correct behavior .",
    "the remaining 94 showed problems in the first days of operation .",

    "the acquisition is fully automated and no operator is needed for data taking .",
    "a `` watchdog '' restarts the system in case of failure and an ups guarantees operation in case of power cut .",
    "information from the cdas processes are kept to diagnose possible crashes .",
    "simple quantities such as the number of stations in operation and the event rate , and more complex ones such as the rate of physics events are checked daily to validate the data acquisition period . over 2004",
    ", the total on - time of the system has been @xmath594% , including all kinds of dead time ( individual detectors down , general power cuts , software upgrades , etc . ) .",
    "table [ tab : dead ] summarizes the various contributions .",
    "it should be noted that this on - time was obtained while priority was being given to the building of the observatory ( deploying new detectors ) over its operation ( repairing failing ones ) , and with evolving software for the detectors , the communication system , and the cdas .",
    "it seems clear that once the observatory is completed and the software stabilized , an on - time above 95% should be achievable .",
