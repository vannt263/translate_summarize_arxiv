    "the she of light is generally believed as a result of an effective spin - orbital interaction , which describes the mutual influence of the spin ( polarization ) and trajectory of the light beam . in general , the spin - dependent splitting in these physics systems is limited by a fraction of the wavelength , and therefore it is disadvantage for potential application to nano - photonic devices .",

    "due to the reversed spin - dependent splitting , the spin accumulation can be switched by slightly adjusting the incident angle .",
    "the she of light may open new opportunities for manipulating photon spin and developing new generation of all - optical devices as counterpart of recently presented spintronics devices  @xcite . it should be mentioned that the spatial separation of the spin components is very small in the refraction .",

    "@xcite and photon tunneling  @xcite the reversed spin accumulation requires the reversed refractive index gradient . as shown in above , the transverse displacements can be tuned to either a negative , or a positive value , or even zero , by just adjusting the incident angle .",
