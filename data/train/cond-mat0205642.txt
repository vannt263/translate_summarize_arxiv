    "the term polyelectrolyte is employed for the wide field of macromolecules which contain dissociable subunits ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . with respect to different dissociation behavior one can distinguish between strong and weak polyelectrolytes @xcite or between quenched and annealed ones @xcite .",
    "so - called strong polyelectrolytes , polysalts as e.g. na - polystyrene sulfonate , dissociate completely in the total ph range accessible by experiment .",
    "the total charge as well as its specific distribution along the chain is solely imposed by chemistry , i.e. , by polymer synthesis .",
    "that is why such polyelectrolytes are also called quenched . on the other hand ,",
    "weak polyelectrolytes represented by polyacids and polybases dissociate only in a rather limited ph range .",
    "the total charge of the chain is not fixed but it can be tuned by changing the ph of the solution . because of dissociation and recombination of ion pairs along the chain one expects spatial and/or temporal fluctuations in the local degree of dissociation .",
    "such titrating polyelectrolytes exhibit an annealed inhomogeneous charge distribution .",
    "a pronounced charge accumulation appears at chain ends because there are fewer neighbors for the charges to interact with and the penalty in energy is therefore reduced .",
    "although , at the level of scaling laws describing the statistical properties of polymer chains , the local charge distribution has only a weak effect on numerical pre - factors @xcite the extra degree of freedom for the charges leads to new and non trivial features .",
    "the charge inhomogeneity can have a strong impact on processes dominated by end - effects , such as the self - assembly of weakly charged linear micelles @xcite and adsorption on charged surfaces @xcite . for end - grafted weak polyelectrolytes ,",
    "a rather unusual regime has been obtained where the chain stretching ( brush thickness ) depends non - monotonously on salt concentration @xcite and grafting density @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the net charge of a chain as well as its distribution along the chain is not fixed but depends on its local environment .",
    "the dissociation of a low molecular acid ( ha ) in an aqueous medium is given by the equilibrium reaction @xmath1 or more simply by @xmath2 the law of mass action yields the equilibrium constant @xmath3\\,\\left [    \\text{a}^-\\right]}{\\left [ \\text{ha}\\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 $ ] , @xmath6 $ ] are the ( monomolar ) concentrations of dissociated and undissociated acid and dissociated hydrogen , respectively . using the standard notation",

    "in contrast to low - molecular - weight acids , the charged groups of polyacids are linked together along the chain .",
    "therefore , the dissociation of one acid group is correlated in a complex way to the position and the number of other charged groups of the chain resulting in a masking of the intrinsic @xmath13 of a ( polyelectrolyte ) monomer .",
    "the corresponding relation can be written @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the electrostatic free energy of the polyelectrolyte chain and @xmath16 is the chain length . introducing the chemical potential @xmath17 eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkapoly ] ) can be written @xmath18 clearly , the chemical potential has two contributions : ( i ) an entropic one related to the mixing of charged and non - charged groups along the chain and ( ii ) an electrostatic one related to the interaction with charged groups forming the local charge environment of an ionizable site . for good and @xmath0 solvents , the electrostatic contribution @xmath19 is an increasing monotonic function of @xmath9 . for poor solvents , raphael and",
    "joanny @xcite found a non - monotonic variation of @xmath20 , and thus of @xmath21 , with @xmath9 which results in a first order phase transition from a collapsed weakly charged conformation to an extended strongly charged state .",
    "the particular behavior of weak polyelectrolytes has attracted considerable interest in experimental @xcite , theoretical @xcite and simulation @xcite studies . because a usual experimental approach to characterizing weak polyelectrolytes is to perform titration experiments",
    "much effort has been done to understand the titration curves , i.e. , the dependence of the degree of ionization ( or the degree of neutralization in the titration experiment ) on the ph of the solution .",
    "the inhomogeneous charge distribution has been first studied by numerical simulation @xcite . for not too large mean charge densities @xmath22 and screening lengths @xmath23 , a quite good agreement between simulation data and the predictions of a linearized density functional approach has been obtained in the case of rod - like polyelectrolytes @xcite . recently a generalization of the theory to the case of flexible chains has been given by castelnovo _",
    "qualitatively they found the result obtained in our previous simulations : a charge accumulation at chain ends .",
    "however , a quantitative comparison between theory and simulation data was not possible because the chains considered by berghold _ at al . _ @xcite are not in the asymptotic regime where the approach used in theory can be applied . a similar end - effect has been demonstrated in simulations of quenched strongly charged polyelectrolytes with explicit counterions : around the ends the counterion distribution is significantly different from that around the inner part of the chain @xcite . however , although the resulting effective charge looks quite similar to that of an annealed polyelectrolyte a quantitative comparison with the corresponding theoretical predictions is not possible due to some important differences between the two systems .",
    "so the theoretical predictions given by castelnovo _ et al . _ are still waiting for a quantitative verification .    in the present paper",
    "we study the non - uniform charge distribution on annealed weakly charged polyelectrolytes in a @xmath0 solvent by ( semi-)grand canonical monte carlo simulation . to be close to the theoretical model we consider chains where neighboring monomers are bound by harmonic springs .",
    "in addition , charged monomers interact with a debye - hckel potential , the screening length of which is tuned over the range where the theory is valid . in this case",
    "we observe not only qualitative agreement between simulation data and theory , but indeed a quite good quantitative one .",
    "although the theoretical single chain problem and its solution in a restricted parameter range may seem rather academic it is a first step towards a more precise understanding of unusual collective properties of , e.g. , annealed polyelectrolyte brushes and stars .",

    "( [ eq : chargedist_chain ] ) , ( [ eq : bjerrum_resc ] ) we know that , in first order theory , the amplitude of charge inhomogeneity is proportional to the rescaled strength of interaction , i.e. , among others it is proportional to @xmath49 . on the other hand , table [ tab : fitting ]",
    "shows that the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 is monotonously reduced with growing @xmath130 and/or @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the larger screening length and degree of charging , the stronger becomes the correction of the ( straightforward ) first order result .",
    "actually this tendency is in complete agreement with the behavior we obtained for rigid rods without introducing any fitting parameter @xcite .",
    "with growing @xmath130 and @xmath9 the first order theory overestimates the inhomogeneity , but this error is compensated ( at least partially ) by the first correction term .",
    "in this paper we reported ( semi-)grand canonical monte carlo simulations of annealed weakly charged polyelectrolytes . in a fairly wide parameter range , i.e. , not too large mean charge densities @xmath132 and screening lengths in the range @xmath133 we find a quite good quantitative agreement between simulation data and the results of the linearized theory recently proposed by castelnovo _",
    "it would be interesting to have experimental evidence for the accumulation of charge at chain ends we obtain within a region of the order of the screening length . in order to being able to compare simulation data with theory",
    "we have restricted the simulations to weakly charged polyelectrolytes ( @xmath134 ) . however , from previous simulations @xcite it is known that the maximum of the overcharging at chain ends appears close to @xmath135 where the charge density at the ends can become about 50% higher than its mean value @xmath136 . in this case",
    "it should be possible to see experimentally the effect of the charge inhomogeneity on processes dominated by end - effects such as , e.g. , self - assembly of weakly charged micelles @xcite and adsorption on charged surfaces @xcite .",
    "but , such a charge density is clearly outside the range where the first order theory is valid . nonetheless the restricted theory , now for the first time proved by simulation data , is a step towards a more precise understanding of the more complex systems mentioned above .",
