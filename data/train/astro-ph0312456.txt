    "omukai and nishi ( 1998 ) , who did include the treatment of radiative transfer , were able to follow the collapse all the way to stellar densities , although their approach was limited to a spherical geometry . in our numerical simulation , we form a sink particle once the gas density exceeds a value of @xmath113  @xmath18 ( see bcl for details about the numerical implementation ) .",
    "this sink particle approximates a hydrostatic core at the center of the accretion flow , although it has a size that is still much larger than the expected scale of the actual core ( omukai and nishi , 1998 ; ripamonti et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the evolution of the dark matter and gas components is calculated with a version of treesph ( hernquist and katz , 1989 ) , combining the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method with a hierarchical ( tree ) gravity solver ( see bcl for further details ) . here",

    "the global system does not evolve by much , while the runaway collapse of the compact dense core converges rapidly .    in general ,",
    "the mass resolution of an sph simulation is approximately @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the number of neighboring particles within a given sph smoothing kernel , @xmath123 the total number of sph particles , and @xmath124 the total baryonic mass .",
    "to avoid numerical artifacts the jeans mass , @xmath125 , has to be resolved ( bate et al . , 2003 ) ,",
    "and so we require @xmath126 . after the onset of gravitational instability in the large - scale simulation ,",
    "the rapid increase in density naturally would lead to a violation of this criterion .",
    "the resampling technique , however , allows us to follow the collapse to a much higher density due to the improved @xmath127 .",
    "we here briefly summarize the resampling procedure ( see bromm , 2000 , and bromm and loeb , 2003 , for details ) .",
    "every sph particle in the original , unrefined simulation acts as a parent particle @xmath128 , and spawns @xmath129 child particles @xmath130 , where @xmath131 in this paper .",
    "the child particles are distributed according to the sph smoothing kernel @xmath132 , by employing a standard monte - carlo comparison - rejection method . here , @xmath133 is the smoothing length of the parent particle .",
    "the velocity , temperature , h@xmath37 abundance , and free - electron abundance are directly inherited from the parent particle , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 for all @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "finally , each child particle is assigned a mass @xmath138 .",
    "this procedure guarantees the conservation of linear and angular momentum .",
    "energy is also conserved well , although there is a small artificial contribution to the gravitational potential energy due to the discreteness of the resampling . the resampling results in @xmath139 35,500 within the central high - resolution region , and",
    "the mass resolution is now @xmath140 , as compared to @xmath141 in the original simulation .",
    "our technique of refining a coarser , parent simulation , and following the further collapse with increased resolution , is conceptually similar to the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) method which has already been successfully applied to problems in star formation ( e.g. , truelove et al . , 1998 ; abel et al . , 2002 ) , but our approach is one of the first attempts of implementing such a scheme within sph ( see also kitsionas and whitworth , 2002 ; bromm and loeb , 2003 ) .    to study accretion onto the central core , the diffuse gas in the envelope must be followed for a sufficiently long time ( roughly equal to the local free - fall timescale ) .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to introduce a central sink particle at some stage in the evolution .",
    "otherwise , we would have to adopt smaller and smaller timesteps to be able to follow the central collapse , and with limited computer resources the surrounding envelope would not have time to be accreted onto the core .",
    "bcl prescribed sph particles to merge into more massive ones , provided they exceed a pre - determined density threshold . the sink particle technique allows us to study the ongoing accretion process over many dynamical times .",
    "within the hierarchical @xmath20cdm model , the first luminous objects are expected to form out of high-@xmath142 peaks in the random field of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "the early ( linear ) evolution of such a peak , assumed to be isolated and roughly spherical , can be described by the top - hat model ( e.g. , padmanabhan , 1993 ) .",
    "we use the top - hat approximation to specify the initial amplitude of the cdm configuration . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the fate of a high-@xmath142 peak of total mass @xmath143 , corresponding to @xmath144 in baryons , which collapses ( or virializes ) at a redshift @xmath145 .",
    "our simulation is initialized at @xmath146 , by performing the following steps .",
    "the collisionless dm particles are placed on a cubical cartesian grid , and are then perturbed according to a given power spectrum @xmath147 , by applying the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation which also allows to self - consistently assign initial velocities .",
    "the power - law index is set to @xmath148 which approximately describes the spectral behavior on the mass scale of @xmath12 .",
    "to fix the amplitude @xmath112 , we specify the initial variance of the fluctuations @xmath149 the summation is over all contributing modes , where the minimum wavenumber is given by the overall size of the cartesian box , and the maximum wavenumber is set by the nyquist frequency , @xmath150 . here , @xmath151 is the mesh size of the cartesian grid .",
    "choosing @xmath152 at @xmath153 , the rms fluctuation at the moment of collapse is @xmath154\\sigma_{i}\\simeq 1 $ ] .",
    "this choice ensures that substructure develops on a similar timescale as the overall collapse of the background medium .",
    "next , particles within a ( proper ) radius of @xmath155  pc are selected for the simulation .",
    "the resulting number of dm particles is @xmath156 .",
    "finally , the particles are set into rigid rotation and are endowed with a uniform hubble expansion ( see katz , 1991 ) .",
    "angular momentum is added by assuming a spin parameter @xmath157 , close to the mean - value measured in cosmological n - body simulations ( e.g. , jang - condell and hernquist , 2001 ) . here , @xmath108 , @xmath158 , and",
    "@xmath159 are the total angular momentum , binding energy , and mass , respectively .",
    "the spin parameter is a measure of the degree of rotational support , such that the ratio of centrifugal to gravitational acceleration is given by @xmath160 at virialization .",
    "the collisional sph particles ( @xmath161 ) are randomly placed to approximate a uniform initial density .",
    "the sph particles follow the same hubble expansion and rigid rotation as the dm particles .",
    "the initial evolution up to the formation of a pre - stellar clump is very similar to the cases studied by bcl .",
    "the gas dissipatively settles into the center of the cdm minihalo , reaching the characteristic state with density @xmath162  @xmath18 and temperature @xmath99  k. in figure  1 ( _ left panel _ ) , we show the morphology within the central @xmath163  pc , briefly after the first high - density core has formed as a result of gravitational runaway collapse .    to study the formation of a population  iii star",
    ", we have re - simulated the evolution of the central clump with sufficient resolution to follow its collapse up to a limiting density of @xmath164  @xmath18 , at which point opacity effects become important ( see  2 ) , and a sink particle is created .",
    "the right panel in figure  1 shows the gas density on a scale of 0.5  pc .",
    "several features are evident in this image .",
    "first , the central clump does not undergo further sub - fragmentation , and is likely to form a single population  iii star .",
    "second , a companion clump is visible at a distance of @xmath165  pc .",
    "if negative feedback from the first - forming star is ignored , this companion clump would undergo runaway collapse on its own , approximately @xmath166  myr later .",
    "this timescale is comparable to the lifetime of a very massive star ( e.g. , bromm et al .",
    "if the second clump were able to survive the intense radiative heating from its neighbor , it could become a star before the first one explodes as a sn . whether more than one star can form in a low - mass halo",
    "thus crucially depends on the degree of synchronization of clump formation .",
    "finally , the non - axisymmetric disturbance induced by the companion clump , as well as the angular momentum stored in the orbital motion of the binary system , allow the system to overcome the angular momentum barrier for the collapse of the central clump ( see larson , 2002 ) , and to possibly form a wide binary star system .",
    "in figure  2 , we consider the radial structure around the central density maximum , shortly before the accreting sink particle is created .",
    "the overall behavior is similar to previous results ( omukai and nishi , 1998 ; abel et al . , 2002 ; ripamonti et al . ,",
    "the density profile [ panel ( a ) ] consists of a central , flat core , surrounded by a roughly isothermal envelope .",
    "such a configuration is generically predicted for collapsing star forming clumps ( see larson , 2003 ) , and can approximately be described by the larson - penston similarity solution .",
    "three - body reactions have succeeded in converting the central @xmath167 into fully molecular form [ panel ( d ) ] .",
    "notice that the central temperature never drops precipitously due to the boost in h@xmath37 cooling , even though h@xmath37 is now more abundant by a factor of @xmath168 .",
    "the opposite effects of compressional heating and h@xmath37 formation heating balance the enhanced cooling rate , and lead to an almost isothermal collapse in the central region .",
    "next , we address the accretion flow onto the central sink particle by tracing its growth for @xmath3  yr after its initial formation .",
    "this accretion process will determine how massive the star finally gets .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of the basic physics of the accretion , then describe the results from earlier 1d calculations , and finally compare these results to our simulation . in general , star formation typically proceeds from the ` inside - out ' through the accretion of gas onto a central hydrostatic core ( e.g. , larson , 2003 ) .",
    "even though the initial mass of the hydrostatic core in the population  iii case is very similar to that in the population  i / ii case , the accretion process is expected to be rather different . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "the accretion rate simply scales as the sound speed cubed over newton s constant ( or equivalently the ratio of the jeans mass and the free - fall time ) : @xmath169 . a comparison of the temperatures in present - day star forming regions ( @xmath170  k ) with those in primordial ones ( @xmath171  k ) already indicates a difference in the accretion rate of more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "omukai and palla ( 2001 , 2003 ) extended earlier work by stahler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and investigated the spherical accretion problem in considerable detail , going beyond the simple dimensional argument given above .",
    "their computational technique approximates the time evolution by considering a sequence of steady - state accretion flows onto a growing hydrostatic core .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , these authors identified a critical accretion rate , @xmath172  yr@xmath24 , beyond which the protostar can not grow to masses much in excess of a few tens of solar masses .",
    "the critical rate is predicted to be almost independent of mass ( omukai and palla , 2003 ) . for smaller rates ,",
    "however , the accretion is predicted to proceed all the way up to @xmath173 , i.e. , of order the host clump mass .",
    "the physical origin of the critical accretion rate is that for ongoing accretion onto the core , the luminosity must not exceed the eddington value , @xmath174 , if the inner region of the gaseous core is ionized by the central star . in our simulation , we do not resolve the evolution of the fully molecular core to temperatures and densities high enough to completely ionize the gas .",
    "our estimate of the accretion rate , evaluated at the density where the gas becomes fully molecular , is likely to be applicable also at the higher density where the gas becomes fully ionized .",
    "this extrapolation assumes that the inflowing gas will not be diverted into outflows before reaching the central protostar",
    ". it will be important to test this assumption in future work , taking into account the magneto - hydrodynamics of possible bipolar jets .",
    "we now ask whether the growing star is able to settle onto the main sequence ( ms ) , without experiencing a strong radiative feedback on the accretion flow . before the onset of hydrogen burning , the luminosity is approximately given by @xmath175 . here , we have ignored the contribution to the overall luminosity from kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) contraction for simplicity , as we are only aiming at an order - of - magnitude estimate . by setting @xmath176",
    "it follows that @xmath177 where @xmath178 , a typical value for a population  iii ms star ( e.g. , bromm et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "this is the critical accretion rate that must not be exceeded upon reaching the ms .",
    "if it is surpassed , radiation pressure on free electrons will drive a strong wind , thus preventing further accretion .",
    "it is possible to start out with accretion rates that are significantly larger than @xmath179 , because at earlier times the protostellar radius is much larger , @xmath180 , and it only gradually shrinks to the ms value in the course of kh contraction . during the kh phase , the star is in hydrostatic equilibrium , but not yet in thermal equilibrium , which is only achieved on the ms when contraction temporarily stops .",
    "the above condition can only determine whether accretion is capable of incorporating most of the diffuse envelope into the star , or whether it is shut - off by radiation pressure early on .",
    "the precise stellar mass in the latter case can only be determined by a detailed simulation that takes both radiative - transfer and the hydrodynamics into account .",
    "such a fully self - consistent calculation has not yet been achieved in three dimensions , although omukai and palla ( 2003 ) , as well as tan and mckee ( 2003 ) , have treated this demanding problem in zero- and one dimension .",
    "realistic flows are expected to produce a time - dependent accretion rate , and so their outcome depends on whether the accretion rate declines rapidly enough to avoid exceeding the eddington luminosity at some stage during the evolution .",
    "the main caveat concerning the omukai and palla ( 2001 , 2003 ) results involves the geometry of the infall .",
    "a three - dimensional accretion flow of gas with angular momentum will deviate from spherical symmetry , and instead form a flattened rotating configuration such as a disk . in this case",
    ", most of the photons will likely escape along the rotation axis ( where the gas density and the corresponding opacity is low ) whereas mass may flow unimpeded along the disk plane ( see tan and mckee , 2003 ) .    in figure  3",
    ", we show the accretion history .",
    "our time - dependent , 3-dimensional simulation provides the accretion flow around a primordial protostar and shows how the molecular core grows in mass over the first @xmath162  yr after its formation .",
    "the accretion rate is initially very high , @xmath181  yr@xmath24 , and subsequently declines with time in a complex fashion . expressed in terms of the sound speed in population  iii pre - stellar cores , the initial rate is : @xmath182 .",
    "initial accretion rates of a few tens times @xmath183 are commonly encountered in simulations of present - day star formation ( larson , 2003 ) .",

    "the complex accretion history encountered in our simulation , however , can not be accommodated with a single power law . such a multiple power - law behavior has previously been inferred ( abel et al . , 2002 ; omukai and palla , 2003 ) . this earlier inference , though , was indirect , in that it did not follow the actual accretion flow , but instead estimated the accretion from the instantaneous density and velocity profiles at the termination of the 3d simulation of abel et al .",

    "our simulated accretion history at early times is consistent with previous estimates , based on 0d and 1d work , but deviates significantly at later times , at @xmath190  yr . furthermore , the accretion flow is not a simple scale - free process when followed over a sufficiently long time .",

    "our simulations do not take into account any feedback effects from the proto - star on the accretion flow .",
    "to ascertain when these are likely to intervene , we compare our accretion history with the critical threshold derived by omukai and palla ( 2003 ) .",
    "we find that as early as @xmath192  yr after the accretion started , the accretion rate drops below @xmath179 , at which point the stellar mass is @xmath193 .",
    "the accretion rate becomes sub - critical early on , while the protostar still undergoes kh contraction .",
    "thus , according to the model of omukai and palla ( 2003 ) , the star can settle onto the ms without experiencing a strong continuum - driven wind , and accretion can continue during the hydrogen - burning stage .",
    "a conservative upper limit for the final mass of the star is then , @xmath194 , assuming that accretion can not go on for longer than the total lifetime of a very massive star , which is almost independent of stellar mass ( e.g. , bond et al .",

    "in particular , we confirm that the gas is converted into a fully molecular phase due to three - body reactions within the central @xmath0  au ( comprising an initial mass of @xmath195 ) .",

    "_ our hydrodynamic simulation lacks radiative transfer and can not address this question , as the answer depends on whether the accretion from the dust - free envelope is eventually terminated by feedback from the star ( e.g. , omukai and palla , 2001 , 2003 ; ripamonti et al . , 2002 ; omukai and inutsuka , 2002 ; tan and mckee , 2003 ) . the standard mechanism by which accretion may be terminated in metal - rich gas , namely radiation pressure on dust grains ( wolfire and cassinelli , 1987 ) , is obviously not effective for gas with a primordial composition .",
