    "the low - temperature phase does not show any magnetic order and is nonmagnetic .",
    "both phases are insulating .",
    "several competing explanations have been proposed to explain the phase transition observed in livo@xmath0 .",
    "goodenough has argued that the inplane v - v separation in this material is near a critical distance @xmath9 that corresponds to the condition where the bandwidth @xmath10 is approximately equal to the on - site correlation energy @xmath1.@xcite according to his phenomenological theory,@xcite materials that have v - v distances near @xmath9 and @xmath11 exhibit an electronic instability that is manifested by the formation of v@xmath3 trimers below @xmath12 . in his words ,",
    "the high - temperature phase is in the localized - electron regime , whereas the low - temperature phase is in the itinerant - electron regime.@xcite that is , in the contemporary parlance , the material is a mott insulator at temperatures @xmath13 and a band insulator when @xmath14 .",
    "each v@xmath6 ion in livo@xmath0 has two electrons in two @xmath15 orbitals , which give rise to spin @xmath16 per site in the mott phase . in the low - temperature `` goodenough phase '' ,",
    "the formation of v@xmath3 trimers results in a gap between the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals of the trimers .",
    "the two electrons per site then completely fill the bonding manifold , with the material displaying a nonmagnetic behavior in this phase .",
    "the trimerization envisaged by goodenough is different from a peierls distortion . in a peierls distortion ,",
    "kinetic energy is gained by moving the occupied electronic states near the fermi level downwards , and this changes the electronic states only near the fermi level .",
    "by contrast , a goodenough distortion involves the formation of covalent bonds between neighboring metal ions , and this changes the electronic structure of the whole @xmath17 manifold .",
    "furthermore , the goodenough distortion is also dissimilar to a charge disproportionation because the charge of a v ion is transferred neither to a neighboring v nor o ion .",
    "et al . _  and others have proposed an alternative scenario for the phase transition in livo@xmath0 that involves an orbital ordering of the localized v@xmath6 @xmath18 electrons.@xcite since the electrons remain localized in the low - temperature phase , a structural distortion plays a minor role in their picture , and the nature of the insulating gap does not change across the phase transition .",
    "the orbital ordering partitions each v layer into three sublattices , and the strong antiferromagnetic exchange between three sites in a triangle leads to the formation of a @xmath19 spin - singlet state .",
    "this naturally removes the frustration of the antiferromagnetic exchange that is present in the high - temperature phase .",
    "despite having been first synthesized in 1954 , experimental studies on stoichiometric single - crystal livo@xmath0 are relatively scarce because of the difficulty in preparing such samples.@xcite resistivity measurements on polycrystalline samples of this material show an anomaly during the phase transition at @xmath12.@xcite early x - ray diffraction studies showed that there is a discontinuity in volume around @xmath12 .",
    "however , no change in crystal symmetry across the transition temperature @xmath12 was found to be apparent.@xcite furthermore , weak superlattice peaks that correspond to an enlarged unit cell and are suggestive of a v@xmath3 trimer formation have also been observed.@xcite several independent nmr measurements have confirmed the nonmagnetic nature of the low - temperature phase.@xcite pair distribution function analyses of synchrotron data have additionally found evidence for two different v - v distances below @xmath12.@xcite    tian _ et al .",

    "resistivity measurements show that both phases exhibit activated behavior with small gaps of 0.14 and 0.18 ev in the low- and high - temperature phases , respectively .",
    "the small values for the gaps indicate either the presence of li deficiency or that both phases are in the verge of metallicity . in the latter case",
    ", a strongly localized picture may not be appropriate for the two phases .",

    "the experimental results reviewed above give a consistent picture of an insulator - to - insulator transition from a paramagnetic to a trimerized nonmagnetic state in livo@xmath0 as the temperature is lowered .",

    "i was able to stabilize a trimerized supercell corresponding to this wave vector , and it exhibits an insulating gap .",

    "in fact , there is substantial @xmath38 character ( not shown ) in the occupied part of the nominal @xmath15 band , which accounts for the fact that the @xmath38 orbital has the largest occupancy with almost 0.6 electrons .    .",

    "[ fig : fs ] , is rather three - dimensional .",
    "the fermi surface does not exhibit any obvious nesting .",

    "i was able to stabilize both the ferromagnetic and the 120@xmath20 inplane ordering configurations of spins .",
    "the 120@xmath20 ordered phase is 100 mev per v lower in energy compared to the ferromagnetic state , which itself is only 6 mev per v lower than the non - spin - polarized state .",
    "this indicates the presence of a strong antiferromagnetic interaction , especially considering the relatively small values of 0.56 and 1.02 @xmath52 for the calculated spin moments on the v sites in the ferromagnetic and 120@xmath20 ordered phase , respectively .",
    "the calculated spin moments are strongly reduced from the value of 2 @xmath52 expected for the @xmath53 spins due to localized v@xmath6 ( @xmath54 ) electrons .",
    "this reduction of moments is at odds with the results of magnetic susceptibility measurements that show the effective moment to have a value @xmath55 @xmath52,@xcite which is close to the value of @xmath56 = 2.8 @xmath52 due to a localized @xmath53 moment .",
    "this disagreement suggests that the itinerant picture of magnetism given by dft may not be adequate to describe the high - temperature phase of livo@xmath0 .",
    "the calculated dos at the fermi energy gets reduced when a magnetic solution is allowed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "however , an insulating gap does not materialize in either spin configuration , again in contrast to the resistivity measurements that show an activated behavior.@xcite i examined the band structure of the ferromagnetic state , shown in fig .",

    "the fermi level passes through two bands .",

    ", the fermi level crosses the lower section of one nominally @xmath15 band .",
    "however , increasing the exchange splitting and making the @xmath15 manifold fully unoccupied in the spin - minority sector will not make the material insulating because the fermi level would still cross the partially occupied @xmath57 band .",
    "to obtain an insulating gap , the partially occupied @xmath57 band should be shifted above the fermi level . even in",
    "the 120@xmath20 ordered spin configuration , i find that the fermi level crosses through the @xmath57 band .",
    "therefore , it seems necessary to explicitly take into account the effects of the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath1 , which will unfill the less - than - half - filled @xmath57 band .",
    "indeed , a dft+@xmath1 study on a related material navo@xmath0 has found an insulating state when the @xmath57 band is completely empty.@xcite     in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "]    i performed dmft calculations on the whole v @xmath21 manifold to confirm the above - described picture of the high - temperature insulating phase of livo@xmath0 .",
    "it is necessary to treat all the v @xmath21 orbitals within dmft even though the lower @xmath15 and the @xmath57 manifold are completely separated from the upper @xmath15 manifold because the orbital characters of the two @xmath15 manifolds are substantially mixed .",
    "a calculation that only considers the lower three bands would in effect be neglecting the offdiagonal parts of the local hamiltonian and would not realistically describe the electronic interactions present in the material .",
    "i used @xmath58 ev and a range of values between 4 and 6 ev for @xmath1 ( @xmath59 ) for the onsite interactions in my dmft calculations .",
    "i could only obtain a paramagnetic insulating solution for @xmath60 ev .",
    "the existence of the insulating solution seems to be contingent upon a low occupancy of the @xmath38 ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath57 ) orbital .",
    "when @xmath61 ev , the occupancy of the @xmath38 ortibal is large ( albeit reduced from the dft value ) , and the system is metallic because the @xmath38 state shows a finite spectral weight at the fermi level .     in the high - temperature rhombohedral structure ,",
    "as obtained from dmft calculations using @xmath62 and @xmath58 ev . the spectra were obtained by analytic continuation of the local green s function in the imaginary matsubara frequencies to real frequency using the maximum entropy method . ]",
    "the momentum integrated spectral function for the case of @xmath62 and @xmath58 ev is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spec ] to illustrate the electronic structure of the high - temperature paramagnetic mott insulating phase .",
    "the spectra display lower and upper hubbard bands , which correspond to the removal and addition of an electron , respectively .",
    "the spectral weight of the @xmath38 orbital below the gap is very small , consistent with the above discussion .",
    "the peak of the @xmath38 spectral function lies below the peak of the upper hubbard band .",
    "so the insulating state is characterized by a gap between the lower hubbard band and the unoccupied @xmath38 band rather than the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 orbitals , which belong to the lower @xmath15 manifold , show larger spectral weight below the gap . in addition , the @xmath42 and @xmath41 orbitals also show sizable weight in the lower hubbard band .",
    "this shows that the orbitals belonging to both the @xmath15 manifolds remain partially occupied in the insulating state .",
    "the paramagnetic insulating state obtained from dmft calculations is qualitatively consistent with goodenough s suggestion that the high - temperature phase of livo@xmath0 is in the localized - electron regime .",
    "the calculated spectral functions and the orbital occupancies summarized in table [ tab : occup ] give a quantitative description of this mott phase , and it would be interesting to perform spectroscopy experiments to see if these calculations realistically describe its electronic structure .      as mentioned above , livo@xmath0 undergoes a first - order structural phase transition from a paramagnetic insulating to a nonmagnetic insulating phase below 490 k. the signatures of the structural transition are seen in the x - ray and electron diffraction experiments that indicate a tripling of the unit cell .",
    "the crystal structure of the low - temperature phase has not been fully determined .",
    "however , goodenough has suggested that the low - temperature phase is characterized by the formation of v@xmath3 trimers,@xcite and recent pair distribution function analyses show the presence of two distinct v - v distances in the low - temperature phase.@xcite it is not known whether the positions of li and o ions also change during the phase transition .",
    "i calculated the phonon dispersions of the non - spin - polarized high - temperature rhombohedral phase to investigate if it shows any structural instabilities .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pband ] , the phonon dispersions show two branches that are unstable along extended paths in the brillouin zone .",
    "these branches are connected to the two acoustic modes near the zone center that are polarized in the inplane direction .",
    "an inspection of the eigenvectors of these unstable modes shows that the instability involves large inplane displacement of v ions .",
    "additionally , the components of these eigenvectors that correspond to li and o ions also show finite values , but they are smaller than the v component . unlike the v displacement , the li and o components",
    "are mostly polarized in the out - of - plane direction .     in the high - temperature rhombohedral structure .",
    "the point @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "the imaginary frequencies are represented with negative values . ]",
    "the displacement patterns of the two unstable modes differ mainly in two aspects .",
    "first , the inplane v displacements due to these two unstable modes are in orthogonal directions .",
    "second , the two o ions in the primitive unit cell move in the opposite directions along the @xmath65 axis for one mode , while they move in the same direction along the @xmath65 axis for the other mode .",
    "the eigenvectors of the two unstable modes at the vector @xmath66 with respect to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the primitive unit cell are shown in table [ tab : eigdisp ] , and they exemplify the above - discussed characteristics of the unstable modes at other points in the brillouin zone as well .

    "the rhombohedral phase does not display an insulating gap when a magnetic solution is allowed because the spin - majority bands are always partially occupied within dft .",
    "i was able to obtain an insulating paramagnetic solution with reasonable values of the onsite coulomb @xmath1 and hund s rule coupling @xmath22 parameters using dmft calculations .",
    "the non - spin - polarized phonon dispersions of the rhombohedral phase show large instabilities of two modes at the wave vector @xmath2 , which corresponds to the extra peaks observed in the diffraction experiments below the phase transition .",
    "a full relaxation of the supercell corresponding to this instability resulted in a nonmagnetic phase that contains v@xmath3 trimers .",
    "in addition , the li and o ions are also displaced due to this structural instability .",
    "these results support goodenough s suggestion that the high - temperature phase of livo@xmath0 is in the localized - electron regime and the v - v covalency drives the transition to a low - temperature trimerized phase in the itinerant - electron regime .",
