    "drawing a diagram of a knot may be a complicated task , especially when the number of crossings is big .",
    "this paper was born from the observation that one ( small ) step in the process of drawing may be skipped .",
    "it is not really necessary for the underlying curve of the diagram to be closed , i.e. , to begin and to end at the same point .",
    "a curve @xmath2 with over / under - crossing data and distinct endpoints determines a knot in @xmath1 in a canonical way .",
    "indeed , let us connect the endpoints of  @xmath3 by an arc in @xmath0 running under the rest of @xmath3 .",
    "this yields a usual knot diagram in  @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that the knot in @xmath1 represented by this diagram does not depend on the choice of the arc and is entirely determined by @xmath3 .",
    "the actual drawing of the arc in question is unnecessary .",
    "this suggests to consider open \" knot diagrams which differ from the usual ones in that the underlying curve is an interval rather than a circle .",
    "we call such open diagrams _ knotoid diagrams_. they yield a new , sometimes simpler way to present knots and also lead to an elementary but possibly useful improvement of the standard seifert estimate from above for the knot genus .",
    "the study of knotoid diagrams also suggests a notion of a knotoid .",
    "knotoids are defined as equivalence classes of knotoid diagrams modulo the usual reidemeister moves applied away from the endpoints .",
    "we show that knotoids in @xmath0 generalize knots in @xmath1 and introduce and study a semigroup of knotoids in @xmath0 containing the usual semigroup of knots as the center .",
    "we also discuss an extension of several knot invariants to knotoids .",
    "the concept of a knotoid may be viewed as a generalization of the concept of a long knot `` on @xmath4 .",
    "more general mixtures '' formed by closed and open knotted curves on the plane were introduced by s. burckel @xcite in 2007 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section0 ]",
    "we introduce knotoid diagrams and discuss their applications to knots .",
    "we introduce knotoids in section [ section1 ] and study the semigroup of knotoids in sections [ section2][section4 ] .",
    "the properties of this semigroup are formulated in section [ section2 ] and proved in section [ section4 ] , where we use the technique of theta - curves detailed in section [ section3 ] . sections [ section77 ] and [ section67 ] deal with the bracket polynomial of knotoids .",
    "the last two sections are concerned with skein modules of knotoids and with knotoids in  @xmath4 .",

    "let @xmath5 be a surface .",
    "a _ knotoid diagram _ @xmath3 in  @xmath5 is a generic immersion of the interval @xmath6 $ ] in the interior of @xmath5 whose only singularities are transversal double points endowed with over / undercrossing data . the images of @xmath7 and  @xmath8 under this immersion are called the _ leg _ and the _ head _ of @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these two points are distinct from each other and from the double points ; they are called the _",
    "endpoints _ of  @xmath3 .",
    "we orient @xmath3 from the leg to the head .",
    "the double points of @xmath3 are called the _ crossings _ of @xmath3 . by abuse of notation , for a knotoid diagram  @xmath3 in  @xmath5 , we write @xmath9 .",
    "examples of knotoid diagrams in @xmath0 with @xmath10 crossings are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] below .",
    "two knotoid diagrams @xmath11 and @xmath12 in  @xmath5 are ( ambient ) isotopic if there is an isotopy of @xmath5 in itself transforming @xmath11 in @xmath12 . note that an isotopy of a knotoid diagram may displace the endpoints .",
    "we define three _ reidemeister moves _",
    "@xmath13 on knotoid diagrams in  @xmath5 .",
    "the move @xmath14 on a knotoid diagram @xmath9 preserves  @xmath3 outside a closed 2-disk in  @xmath5 disjoint from the endpoints and modifies @xmath3 within this disk as the standard @xmath15-th reidemeister move , for @xmath16 ( pushing a branch of @xmath3 over / under the endpoints is not allowed ) .    we introduce two more moves on knotoid diagrams . the move @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) pulls the strand adjacent to the head or the leg under ( resp .  over ) a transversal strand ,",

    "the theory of knotoid diagrams suggests a new diagrammatic approach to knots . unless explicitly stated to the contrary , by a knot we mean an isotopy class of smooth embeddings of an oriented circle into @xmath20 or , equivalently , into @xmath21 .",

    "we turn @xmath24 into a knot diagram by declaring that @xmath25 passes everywhere under @xmath3 .",
    "the orientation of @xmath3 from the leg to the head defines an orientation of @xmath24 .",
    "the knot in @xmath26 represented by @xmath24 is denoted  @xmath27 ; we say that @xmath3 represents @xmath28 or that @xmath3 is a knotoid diagram of @xmath28 .",
    "the knot  @xmath27 does not depend on the choice of the shortcut @xmath25 because any two shortcuts for @xmath3 are isotopic in the class of embedded arcs in @xmath29 connecting the endpoints of  @xmath3 .",
    "these isotopies induce isotopies and reidemeister moves on the corresponding knot diagrams  @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear that every knot @xmath30 may be represented by a knotoid diagram .",
    "indeed , take a ( usual ) knot diagram of @xmath31 and cut out an underpassing strand .",
    "the strand may contain no crossings , or 1 crossing , or @xmath32 crossings . in all cases",
    "we obtain a knotoid diagram of  @xmath31 .",
    "it is clear that two knotoid diagrams represent isotopic knots if and only if these diagrams may be related by isotopy in  @xmath0 , the reidemeister moves ( away from the endpoints ) , and the moves @xmath33 .",
    "alternatively , one can start with a knotoid diagram @xmath2 and consider the knot diagram obtained from @xmath3 by adjoining a shortcut for @xmath3 passing _ over _",
    "this yields a knot @xmath34 . in this context , the moves @xmath35 become forbidden and @xmath36 allowed .",
    "the diagrammatic approach to knots based on knotoid diagrams extends to oriented links in @xmath1 through the use of multi - knotoid diagrams in  @xmath0 .",
    "since a knotoid diagram @xmath2 fully determines the knot @xmath37 , one should be able to read all invariants of this knot directly from @xmath3 .",
    "we compute here the group @xmath38 from @xmath3 .",
    "similarly to the wirtinger presentation in the theory of knot diagrams , we associate with every knotoid diagram @xmath3 in an oriented surface @xmath5 a _ knotoid group _ @xmath39 . this group is defined by generators and relations .",
    "observe that @xmath3 breaks at its crossings into a disjoint union of embedded overpassing \" segments in @xmath5 .",
    "the generators of @xmath39 are associated with these segments .",
    "( the generator associated with a segment is usually represented by a small arrow crossing the segment from the right to the left . )",
    "we impose on these generators the standard wirtinger relations associated with the crossings of @xmath3 , see @xcite , p. 110 . if @xmath3 has @xmath40 crossings , then we obtain @xmath41 generators and @xmath40 relations .",
    "the resulting group @xmath39 is preserved under isotopy and the moves @xmath42 on @xmath3 . for example , if @xmath3 is a trivial knotoid diagram , then @xmath43 .",
    "[ le4 ] for any knotoid diagram @xmath2 of a knot @xmath44 , @xmath45    it suffices to consider the case where @xmath3 has at least one crossing .",
    "applying @xmath46 to @xmath3 several times , we can transform @xmath3 into a knotoid diagram whose endpoints lie close to each other , i.e. , may be connected by an arc @xmath23 disjoint from the rest of @xmath3 . then @xmath24 is a knot diagram of @xmath47 . the presentation of @xmath39 above differs from the wirtinger presentation of @xmath48 determined by the knot diagram @xmath24 in only one aspect : the segments of  @xmath3 adjacent to the endpoints contribute different generators @xmath49 , @xmath50 to the set of generators of  @xmath39 . in the diagram",
    "these two segments are united and contribute the same generator to the wirtinger presentation .",
    "therefore @xmath48 is the quotient of @xmath39 by the normal subgroup generated by @xmath51 .",

    "a similar method allows one to associate with any knotoid diagram a _ knotoid quandle _ , generalizing the knot quandle due to d.  joyce and s.  matveev .      the crossing number @xmath54 of a knot @xmath55 is defined as the minimal number of crossings in a knot diagram of @xmath31 .",
