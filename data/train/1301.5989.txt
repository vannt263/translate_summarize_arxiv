    "the problem of flexure is one of the now classical problems of the theory of non - linear , incompressible elasticity .",
    "first formulated and solved by rivlin @xcite , it has since been studied extensively in the literature , see for example green and zerna @xcite and ogden @xcite .",
    "there is continuing theoretical interest in this problem , as can be seen , for example , in the recent study of kanner and horgan @xcite .",
    "the physical problem considered is easily visualized : a rectangular specimen is bent by equal and opposite terminal couples applied on the end faces of a rectangular block , while its other faces remain free of traction .",
    "rivlin @xcite shows that if a circular , annular sector is assumed for the deformed configuration , then an elegant solution to the corresponding boundary value problem can be found .",
    "we recall this derivation in sections [ large_plane_strain_bending ] and [ the_stress - free_boundary_conditions ] .",
    "typically , the usual formulation of this boundary value problem implicitly assumes that the terminal moments are specified .",
    "it is shown here that specifying instead the _ bending angle _ through which the block is bent results in a simpler mathematical formulation and solution of the problem .",
    "we show that this solution depends on only one non - dimensional parameter : the product of the aspect ratio of the block and the bending angle , which we denote by @xmath3 . if @xmath3 is assumed small , then the solution at low orders has a particularly simple form .",
    "because @xmath3 is the product of the aspect ratio of the block and the bending angle , the lower - order solutions are applicable in at least two distinct physical regimes : the first corresponds to the bending of bars through an infinitesimal bending angle and the second corresponds to the non - linear bending of thin sheets .",
    "although these two sub - cases are the most important , there are other possibilities : moderately thick blocks could also be considered turned through moderate angles , provided the product @xmath3 is small .    to analyze the problem , _ plane strain _ conditions can be assumed .",
    "hence the technical interpretation of our results is that they describe the bending of planar sections of infinitely wide blocks .",
    "we assume that the plane strain results obtained are also applicable to strips with a finite , out of the plane dimension larger than the block thickness , i.e. that the edge / anticlastic effects are negligible .",
    "this assumption is motivated by observations and measurements for the bending of rubber blocks , see gent and cho @xcite .",
    "of course , this assumption is a limitation of rivlin s solution , because secondary fields are bound to be observed outside of a central area in the bent block , see figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "nonetheless , it must be kept in mind that rivlin s solution is one of the very few _ universal _ solutions , valid in principle for every incompressible isotropic material , whatever the actual dimensions of the block and the amount of bending . for more refined deformations , albeit limited to certain types of geometries , the reader is referred to the advances obtained by shield @xcite .",
    "the other limitation of this solution is that it might bifurcate , see @xcite for an in - depth treatment of this possibility .    given that here , the deformation depends only on the bending angle , the corresponding stress distribution can be easily determined .",
    "the most important functional of this stress distribution is the moment that needs to be applied at the ends of the block to effect the deformation . in sections [ some_approximations_of_the_deformed_configuration ] and [ exact_results_for_the_moment ] ,",
    "we show that the general relation between applied moment and the parameter @xmath3 , the main relation of interest in this problem , can be expressed in a succinct and elegant form .",
    "it is shown that this relation is an odd function in @xmath3 , which agrees with an intuitive expectation that the moment should be an odd function of the angle since the moment required to bend a block by an angle @xmath4 say , is the opposite of the moment required to bend it by an angle @xmath5 .    on expanding the moment in a maclaurin series in @xmath3 ( section [ approximate_results_for_the_moment ] ) , we find that the first - order coefficient is proportional to @xmath0 , the shear modulus of linear elasticity .",
    "the second - order coefficient is identically zero for all elastic materials , because the moment is an odd function in @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that the linearized moment - angle relation is likely to be valid for @xmath3 values beyond the infinitesimal range , and this is verified numerically and experimentally in section [ experimental_results ] .",
    "prior to this , we show in section [ weak_non - linear_elasticity ] that the third - order term in the expansion is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the non - linear coefficient of plane shear waves @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are landau third- and fourth - order elastic constants @xcite . this coefficient has been measured for agar - based gels , based on the measurement of shear wave speeds in transient elastography @xcite , or on the measurement of homogeneous plane strain deformations @xcite .",
    "clearly , the information collected from the bending of a block , such as that provided by a bending stiffness tester @xcite , yields a simple and useful alternative to these protocols .    in section [ experimental_results ] , our main results",
    "are then compared to experimental data obtained by performing a bending experiment on a polyurethane elastomer .",
    "we find that @xmath9 .",
    "the fundamental assumption introduced by rivlin @xcite to model the non - linear flexure of an incompressible block is that a block of length @xmath10 and thickness @xmath11 is deformed under applied terminal moments into a circular , annular sector . for definiteness ,",
    "assume that that the faces @xmath12 are deformed into the inner and outer radii , denoted by @xmath13 , @xmath14 respectively , of the annular sector and the faces @xmath15 are deformed into the faces @xmath16 , where @xmath4 , the bending angle , is a @xmath17 constant .",
    "plane strain conditions are assumed throughout . the _ bending angle _ , @xmath4 ,",
    "is restricted to lie in the range @xmath18 which only allows a block to be bent into at most a circular annulus , see figure [ figure2 ] .    adopting the semi - inverse approach of rivlin @xcite ,",
    "assume that @xmath19 where ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) denote the cartesian and cylindrical polar coordinates of a typical particle before and after deformation , respectively .",
    "incompressibility then yields @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , are constants .    as noted by rivlin @xcite ,",
    "symmetric boundary value problems can be considered without loss of generality and therefore @xmath26 .",
    "the key element in our solution of the bending problem is that the bending angle , @xmath4 , is specified and not the applied moment , as is usually assumed in most treatments , even if this assumption is implicit .",
    "it therefore follows easily that @xmath23 can be _ determined _ as @xmath27 this yields the non - homogeneous deformation field @xmath28 where @xmath25 remains to be determined .",
    "therefore , the inner and outer radii of the deformed curved surfaces are determined by @xmath29 adding and subtracting these equations then yields @xmath30    hereafter we consider the boundary value problem where equal and opposite moments are applied to the ends of the block at @xmath31 .",
    "the other classical boundary value problem of flexure , where one end is held fixed and a moment applied to the free end , is a subregion of the problem considered here with the fixed end described by @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding deformation gradient tensor , @xmath33 , is given by @xmath34 denoting the principal stretches by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "it is now clear that rivlin s solution is a _ plane strain _ deformation , because @xmath38 at all times .    for homogeneous , incompressible , elastic materials ,",
    "the corresponding principal cauchy stresses are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an arbitrary scalar field , @xmath41 is the strain - energy function and the comma subscript denotes partial differentiation with respect to the appropriate principal stretch . the equations of equilibrium determine @xmath40 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "it therefore follows immediately that @xmath44    now define the function @xmath45 as @xmath46 which is assumed to be a convex function .",
    "then @xmath47 where the prime denotes differentiation .",
    "the stress distribution can then be written simply as functions of @xmath48 as @xmath49 the curved surfaces of the bent block are assumed to be free of traction .",
    "this assumption then yields @xmath50 where @xmath51    no assumptions have been made thus far about material symmetry .",
    "only isotropic materials will be considered here . for these materials , @xmath52 , and so yields",
    "@xmath53 there are two obvious solutions to these equations : @xmath54 , which is physically unacceptable , and @xcite @xmath55 which is assumed henceforth .",
    "solving for @xmath14 and substitution into @xmath56 yields a quadratic equation for @xmath57 , with the following unique physically acceptable solution : @xmath58 which completely determines the deformed configuration .",
    "unusually , it is _ independent _ of the form of the strain - energy function ( provided that , which is sufficient for to be satisfied , is also necessary ) .",
    "also note that for isotropic materials , it follows immediately from that @xmath59    substitution of and into yields the following form for the stretches in terms of the non - dimensional parameter @xmath3 : @xmath60 where @xmath3 is the product of the block aspect ratio by the bending angle , @xmath61    finally , the qualitative features of the stress distribution will be determined .",
    "equation @xmath62 yields @xmath63 it follows immediately from these , the assumed convexity of @xmath64 , and that the radial stress has a unique minimum value of @xmath65 at @xmath66 and since the curved surfaces are assumed stress - free , the radial stress is therefore compressive in the interior of the bent block .",
    "convexity also yields that the hoop stress is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath67 , compressive on the inner curved surface and tensile on the outer .",
    "since the deformed configuration is independent of the form of the strain - energy function , asymptotic expansions in @xmath3 are valid for all incompressible elastic materials . expanding and its counterpart for @xmath68 in a maclaurin series in @xmath3 yields @xmath69 , \\qquad r_b = \\dfrac{l}{\\alpha}\\left[1 + \\halft \\epsilon + \\eightt \\epsilon^2 + \\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon^3)\\right].\\ ] ] to the leading order , we have @xmath70 giving a curvature @xmath71 thus infinitesimally thin sheets , strips , and wires are bent into a circular arc whose radius is inversely proportional to the bending angle .",
    "truncating the series after the linear terms in , and thus we are now considering thin , but not infinitesimally thin , sheets , strips , and wires , yields @xmath72 which are again remarkably simple and which tell us that the thickness of the deformed block is still @xmath11 .    retaining the _",
    "terms in the expansions yields that , again , @xmath73 .",
    "the associated stress distribution naturally requires specification of the form of the strain - energy function in order to be determined .",
    "the most important functional of this stress distribution is the moment , @xmath74 , required to bend the block by an angle @xmath4 .",
    "this moment is given by @xmath75 which can be re - written in terms of the parameter @xmath3 defined in as follows : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 have been defined in terms of @xmath3 through . to derive this expression , we made use of @xmath56 , @xmath56 , , @xmath62 , and .",
    "note that in @xcite , the last term of this expression is missing ; note also that the expression of @xmath74 in terms of an integral in @xmath67 can be found in rivlin s original paper @xcite , see also kanner and horgan @xcite .",
    "it follows trivially from @xmath56 and that @xmath74 is an",
    "_ odd _ function of @xmath3 .",
    "we remark that in this paper , @xmath74 is the applied moment per unit width of the block : if the block s width is @xmath79 , then the total applied moment is @xmath80 .",
    "the integral term in surprisingly means that explicit relations between the moment and bending angle in terms of elementary functions are difficult to obtain in general .",
    "progress can be made however for some forms of @xmath81 .",
    "for example , kanner and horgan @xcite compute @xmath74 for the mooney - rivlin material and for the gent @xcite material .",
    "we focus on the following rivlin expansion of the strain - energy density in the principal invariants of the cauchy - green strain tensors @xcite , @xmath82 where the @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are constants to be determined from experiments ( see erkamp et al .",
    "@xcite for example ) , and @xmath85 this strain energy density is readily implemented in most finite element analysis packages .",
    "it includes the neo - hookean and mooney - rivlin materials . in the case of plane strain , such as the bending problem considered here , @xmath86 , so that @xmath81 reduces to @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the infinitesimal shear modulus , and",
    "@xmath89 is the non - linear shear coefficient @xcite .",
    "substitution into the general moment relation then yields the exact , nonlinear relation @xmath90 + \\frac{8}{3 } \\beta \\epsilon.\\ ] ] the last term in this expression shows that @xmath74 grows unbounded with @xmath3 , except in the special mooney - rivlin case for which @xmath91 and where the asymptotic value is @xmath92 @xcite .    in figure [ figure3 ] ,",
    "we plot @xmath93 as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath94 .",
    "a noteworthy feature of this plot is that there is a linear response quite far beyond the origin .",
    "this is explained in the next section .",
    "expanding the general expression for the moment @xmath74 in a maclaurin series in @xmath3 , and noting both that @xmath74 is odd in @xmath3 and , yields    @xmath95\\epsilon +   \\frac{1}{120}\\left[\\widetilde{w}''''(1 ) + 8\\widetilde{w}'''(1 ) - 3\\widetilde{w}''(1)\\right]\\epsilon^3 + \\ldots\\ ] ]    recall that only isotropic , incompressible materials are being considered here . differentiating with respect to @xmath48 and evaluation in the reference configuration yields @xmath96 where the partial derivatives of @xmath81 are evaluated at @xmath97 .",
    "the last of equations ( 6.1.88 ) of ogden @xcite then yields @xmath98 the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath48 can be expressed in the form @xmath99 for some function @xmath100 , say .",
    "it then follows that @xmath101 and @xmath102 , or @xmath103 so for isotropic materials the moment relation can be written in the form @xmath104\\epsilon^3 + \\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon^5),\\ ] ] which explains why the linear regime carries for moderate values of @xmath3 in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "because we are looking at small , but not infinitesimal , elastic effects , we place ourselves in the theory of _ weak non - linear elasticity _ @xcite . there , the strain energy density is expanded in terms of @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the green - lagrange strain tensor ( with eigenvalues @xmath107 ) . for _",
    "incompressible _ solids , ogden @xcite shows that the expansion of @xmath81 up to terms which are of order four or less in the green - lagrange strain involves only three material constants . in the notation of hamilton et al .",
    "@xcite , it is written as @xmath108 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are nonlinear landau elasticity constants .",
    "the appendix shows that _ at the same order of approximation _ in the strains , the rivlin strain energy density coincides with the fourth - order elasticity expansion when @xmath109 conversely , we find that @xmath2 introduced in can be written as @xmath110 in agreement with zabolotzkya et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consequently the general moment-@xmath3 relation for fourth - order elasticity has the form @xmath111 or , in non - dimensional form , @xmath112 we remark that this expansion is in agreement with the maclaurin series derived from the exact expression , see rivlin @xcite .",
    "we also note that _ fourth - order elasticity is necessary and sufficient _ to express the onset of non - linearity present in the coefficient of @xmath113 in : third - order elasticity can not account for all the components of that coefficient , and we checked that fifth - order constants do not appear in it ( these calculations are not reproduced here ) .",
    "finally , we check that the expansion is consistent with classic elastic theory , which tells us that the total flexural moment required to achieve a curvature @xmath114 of a plate with width @xmath79 and thickness @xmath11 is @xmath115 where @xmath116 is young s modulus and @xmath117 is the moment of inertia of cross - sectional area . here",
    "the block is rectangular and @xmath118 .",
    "also , the curvature is @xmath119 , see section [ some_approximations_of_the_deformed_configuration ] .",
    "moreover , it is known that in classic _ plane strain _ theory , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is poisson s ratio . as we are dealing only with incompressible solids , @xmath122 , and",
    "we find that the linear term in , or in ( or the term obtained from a linear expansion in @xmath3 of ) is indeed given by .",
    "we conducted bending experiments on several strips of elastomers , using a tinius olsen bending stiffness tester .",
    "that tester meets the requirements of the astm standard test method e855 @xcite .",
    "we used strips which were about 4.5 mm thick .",
    "the tester imposes a moment at two points of the strip separated by half - an - inch .",
    "hence the aspect ratio of the strips , with respect to the bending experiments , was @xmath123 .",
    "we bent the samples by small , moderate , and large bending angles , but noticed that at large angles , pinching ( and perhaps also wrinkling @xcite ) took place on the inner face of the bent strip .",
    "consequently we only retained the data up to an angle of 60@xmath124 , which gives the following range for the expansion parameter : @xmath125 .    in figure",
    "[ figure4 ] , we show the results of one representative experiment , for a strip of polyurethane elastomer , shore hardness 40a . on the vertical axis ,",
    "the variable is a non - dimensional measure of the moment , @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the maximum bending moment of the tester s pendulum ( see astm standard test method e855 @xcite for details ) ; the actual value of @xmath127 is irrelevant , as we are only interested in measuring the non - dimensional parameter @xmath2 . on the horizontal axis ,",
    "the variable is @xmath3 .",
    "the circles represent the recorded experimental data ( 16 measurements in the 0 - 60@xmath124 degree range for the angle of bending ) .",
    "the straight dashed line corresponds to the fitting with linear elasticity theory ( @xmath128 , equation ) , and the full thick plot corresponds to the fitting with fourth - order elasticity theory .",
    "only one parameter ( @xmath2 ) is to be determined from the cubic relation , which ensures the existence and unicity of the fitting parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we obtained a good agreement when @xmath129 .    _ table 1 .",
