    "cosmological observations  @xcite indicate that more than two thirds of the energy density of the universe is in a component with negative pressure .",
    "candidates for this missing energy , which is causing the universe to accelerate , include a cosmological constant and scalar field models with equation of state @xmath10 , often referred to as quintessence  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the scalar field is either decoupled from cold dark matter ( cdm ) or couples to cdm but not to the baryons ( coupled quintessence )    in order to generate the present day acceleration the scalar field in these models must be evolving slowly and hence have a tiny mass , of order the present day hubble constant , @xmath11 . since the mass of a quintessence field is very small , it can give rise to a new long - range force .",
    "such a force has not been observed and consequently the coupling of the quintessence field to matter must be very small . unfortunately , in effective theories derived from string",
    "theory nearly massless fields couple to matter with gravitational strength and would produce unacceptably large violations of the equivalence principle .",
    "khoury and weltman have proposed a scenario where a scalar field with gravitational strength coupling to matter can evolve on a hubble timescale and generate the present day acceleration while evading all existing tests of gravity @xcite .",
    "the key feature of this scenario is that the scalar field , which is dubbed the chameleon , has a mass which depends on the local background matter density . on earth where the density is high",
    ", the compton wavelength of the field is sufficiently small to satisfy all current tests of gravity , while on cosmological scales , where the density is tiny , the field has a much smaller mass and can drive the present day acceleration @xcite . the field , however , is heavier than in standard quintessence models ( @xmath12 ) . in the solar system , where the density is many orders of magnitude smaller than on earth , the chameleon is essentially a free field and mediates a long range force which could be detected by upcoming satellite experiments  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological history of the chameleon field was studied in ref .",
    "it was shown that there is an attractor solution , analogous to the tracker solution in quintessence models , where the chameleon quickly settles into the minimum of its effective potential , and for a broad class of potentials and initial conditions the chameleon can satisfy all observational constraints .",
    "the evolution of the density perturbations was also investigated .",
    "it was shown that perturbations on scales smaller than the scale of the chameleon feel a larger effective newton s constant which causes them to grow more rapidly .",
    "the length scale of the chameleon ( @xmath13 at present ) is somewhat smaller than the scales probed by large scale structure observations .",
    "there has , however , recently been much interest in the properties of the first generation of dark matter structures to form in the universe , and the possibility that they may leave an observable imprint in the present day dark matter distribution  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the effects of the chameleon on the density perturbations on sub - galactic scales and the properties ( formation epoch and over - density ) of the first gravitationally bound structures to form . in section  [ chamdyn ]",
    "we review the necessary aspects of the chameleon and its dynamics from ref .  @xcite . in section  [ pert ]",
    "we extend the calculations of the evolution of density perturbations in refs .",
    "@xcite to include the effects of the chameleon .",
    "finally in section  [ sscham ] we examine the effect of the chameleon on the formation of small scale structure .",
    "the action describing the chameleon field , @xmath14 , matter and gravity has the general form @xmath15 - \\int { \\rm d}^4 x         { \\cal l}_{\\rm m}(\\chi_{\\rm m}^{({\\rm i } ) } g_{\\mu \\nu}^{({\\rm i } ) } ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath17 are the various matter fields .",
    "the metrics governing the excitations of the matter fields are related to the einstein frame metric @xmath18 via the conformal rescaling @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are dimensionless quantities of order unity  @xcite .",
    "notice that the scalar field couples to all matter species including the baryons . as an example",
    ", this is the case for the radion field describing the interbrane distance in brane world models based on the randall  sundrum model @xcite in which branes are nearby , for which @xmath21 .    by varying the action with respect",
    "to @xmath14 it can be shown  @xcite that the dynamics of @xmath14 are governed by the effective potential @xmath22 where the matter density @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 so that it is independent of @xmath14 and conserved in the einstein frame .",
    "if @xmath25 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath14 and @xmath26 , this potential has a minimum , @xmath27 , which increases with decreasing @xmath23 .",
    "the mass of small fluctuations about @xmath27 increases with increasing @xmath27 so that the chameleon can evade local tests of the equivalence principle and fifth forces , due to the high local density .",
    "fiducial potentials of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 so as to produce the observed present day dark energy density ( and also satisfy local tests of general relativity ) were studied in ref .",
    "assuming for simplicity a single matter component with density @xmath30 and coupling @xmath31 , the field value at the minimum of the effective potential satisfies @xmath32 it was found that for a wide range of initial conditions the chameleon field reaches the attractor solution with @xmath33 before big bang nucleosynthesis and has a cosmological evolution in accordance with all observational constraints .    the presence of a chameleon field can effect the growth of structure in particular on small scales . in the following , we will consider the modifications to the growth factor due to the gravitational effects induced by the chameleon .",

    "consequently the interaction scale of the chameleon field is always much smaller than the horizon @xmath45 , and the evolution of perturbations on super - horizon scales is unaffected by the chameleon .",
    "furthermore the chameleon does not couple to radiation , since it is a traceless fluid , and the evolution of perturbations deep within the radiation dominated epoch is also as in standard cosmology  @xcite .",
    "once @xmath46 ( which for sub - galactic scales happens prior to matter - radiation equality ) , however , the dark matter terms dominate as the source in the poisson equation , eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) , and the coupling of the chameleon to the matter density is now important .",
    "in particular , perturbations in matter will influence perturbations in the chameleon field and vice versa .    on the sub - horizon scales we are interested in we",
    "can neglect the oscillations in the perturbations in the chameleon field , and @xmath47 is also small as the field evolves along the minimum of the effective potential @xcite .",

    "the physical size of the halos post collapse is proportional to @xmath158 and hence the density contrast is proportional to @xmath159 i.e. the earlier halos form the more over - dense they are at later times ( reflecting the higher matter density at the time they form ) . in fig .",

    "we therefore expect that the present day dark matter distribution on small scales would be more clumped than in standard cosmology and this could be detectable via axion detectors or wimp direct and indirect detection experiments ( the survival probability of the first dark matter halos even in standard cosmology is the subject of ongoing studies  @xcite ) . this alone would not provide a ` smoking gun ' for the chameleon , as other modifications of general relativity could also lead to enhanced growth of small scale density perturbations and hence small scale structure .",
