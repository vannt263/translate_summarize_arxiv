    "traditionally , wireless communication systems use a time - division or frequency - division approach to bidirectional communication .",
    "this involves dividing the spectral resources into orthogonal component resulting in half - duplex ( hd ) communication .",
    "recent advances , nevertheless , suggest that full - duplex ( fd ) communication that allows simultaneous transmission and reception of signal over the same radio channel be possible @xcite .",
    "since radio signals that carry information can also be used as a vehicle for transporting energy , the emergence of fd technology brings a new opportunity for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) @xcite .",
    "a practical application of swipt technology is seen in battery - limited devices such as sensor nodes mounted at some inaccessible or difficult - to - access locations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , much interest has turned to fd relaying in which information is sent from a source node to a destination node through an intermediate fd relaying node . in the literature ,",
    "relay aided swipt systems have been largely considered for hd relaying @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors in @xcite considered swipt in fd relaying where only the relay node works in fd mode .",
    "most recently , @xcite considered swipt in fd multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) relay system and used a power splitting ( ps ) relaying approach with fixed transmit power at the source nodes .",
    "however , the transmit power in fd systems affects the self - interference ( si ) and careful optimization is necessary in order to maximize the achievable rate .",
    "in contrast to the existing results , this paper investigates the joint optimization of the transmit power at the source nodes and the two - way relay beamforming matrix for swipt with a fd mimo amplify and forward ( af ) relay employing ps , where the achievable sum - rate is maximized subject to energy harvesting and individual power constraints .    _",
    "notations_we use @xmath0 to represent a complex matrix with dimension of @xmath1 . also , we use @xmath2 to denote the conjugate transpose , while @xmath3 is the trace operation , and @xmath4 denotes the frobenius norm .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 returns the absolute value of a scalar , and @xmath6 denotes that the hermitian matrix @xmath7 is positive semidefinite .",
    "the expectation operator is denoted by @xmath8 we define @xmath9 as the orthogonal projection onto the column space of @xmath10 ; and @xmath11 as the orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal complement of the column space of @xmath12",
    "consider swipt in a three - node relaying network consisting of two sources @xmath13 and @xmath14 wanting to exchange information with the aid of an intermediate mimo af relay @xmath15 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sys ] . in this model , the two source nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the relay @xmath18 are assumed to operate in fd mode .",
    "we also assume that there is no direct link between @xmath16 and @xmath19 so communication between them must be done through @xmath20 both @xmath16 and @xmath17 transmit their messages simultaneously to @xmath21 with transmit power @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .    in the broadcast phase ,",
    "relay @xmath21 employs linear processing with amplification matrix @xmath24 to process the received signals and broadcast the processed signals to the nodes with harvested power @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the source nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are equipped with a pair of transmitter - receiver antennas for signal transmission and reception , respectively .",
    "we denote the numbers of transmit and receive antennas at @xmath21 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "we use @xmath28 and @xmath29 to denote the directional channel vectors between the source node @xmath30 s @xmath31 ) transmit antennas to @xmath21 s receive antennas , respectively , and that between the relay s transmit antenna(s ) to the node @xmath30 s receiver antennas .",
    "the simultaneous transmission and reception of signals at the nodes in fd produces si which if not properly handled inhibits the overall performance of fd systems .",
    "we thus consider using existing si cancellation mechanisms ( e.g. , antenna isolation , digital and analog cancellation , etc . ) to mitigate the si .",
    "due to imperfect channel estimation however , the si can not be completely eliminated @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 as the si channel at the corresponding nodes . for simplicity",
    ", the residual si ( rsi ) channel is modelled as gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath35 , for @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we further assume that @xmath18 is equipped with a ps device which splits the received signal power at the relay such that a @xmath37 portion of the received signal power is fed to the information receiver ( ir ) and the remaining @xmath38 portion of the power is fed to the energy receiver ( er ) at the relay .",
    "when the source nodes transmit their signals to the relay , it is known that the af relay will incur a short delay to perform linear processing .",
    "it is generally assumed that the processing delay at the relay which corresponds to the processing time to implement fd operation is given by a @xmath39 symbol duration , which typically takes integer values @xcite .",
    "the duration of @xmath39 is assumed to be short enough when compared to a time slot which has a larger number of data symbols , and therefore its affect on the achievable rate can be safely neglected @xcite .    at time",

    "traditionally , in conventional hd relaying communications , bidirectional information exchange between @xmath13 and @xmath14 occur in two phases .",
    "in contrast , fd relaying systems reduce the entire operation to only one phase , hence increasing spectral efficiency .",
    "however , fd operation generates si at each node , thus @xmath13 and @xmath14 may not always use their maximum transmit power as it increases the level of rsi , so each node must carefully choose its transmit power .    to ensure continuous information transfer between the two sources ,",
    "the harvested energy at @xmath18 must be above certain useful level , given by a prescribed threshold .",
    "as such , we formulate the following joint relay beamforming , transmit power and receive ps ratio ( @xmath70 ) optimization problem : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the sum - rate of the fd af relay swipt system , @xmath73 is the maximum transmit power at the relay and @xmath74 is the minimum amount of harvested energy required .",
    "we consider single data stream only transmissions at the sources and assume that network coding principle encourages mixing of the data from the sources .",
    "therefore , we can decompose @xmath75 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the transmit beamforming vector and @xmath78 is the receive beamforming vector at the relay .",
    "accordingly , the zeroforcing constraint can then be simplified to @xmath79 or equivalently @xmath80 since in general @xmath81 @xcite .",

    "results obtained in @xcite showed that @xmath78 can be parameterized by @xmath89 as @xmath90 it is worth noting that ( [ pramet ] ) does not completely characterizes @xmath78 as it is also involved in the zf constraint @xmath91 however , this parameterization makes the problem more tractable .",
    "thus , for given value of @xmath92 we can optimize @xmath77 for known transmit powers @xmath22 and @xmath23 and for a fixed ps ratio ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "consequently , we can perform a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) search to find the optimal @xmath94 which guarantees the optimal value for @xmath86      for fixed transmit power ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and given @xmath78 and @xmath77 , the optimal receive ps ratio @xmath93 can be found .",

    "it is worth noting that the left hand side of constraint ( [ rhoc1 ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath93 whereas that of constraint ( [ rhoc2 ] ) is an increasing function of @xmath97 now , the largest @xmath93 satisfying ( [ rhoc1 ] ) to equality is given by @xmath99 on the other hand , the maximal @xmath93 satisfying constraint to equality is given by @xmath100 we investigate whether @xmath101 satisfies the constraint .",

    ".      for fixed values of the receive ps ( @xmath93 ) at the relay and the transmit power ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) at the sources , problem ( [ y6 ] ) can be reformulated as @xmath104 let us proceed to separately optimize @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the next two subsections .      here",

    ", we propose to use the difference of convex programming ( dc ) to find the local optimum point .",
    "therefore , we can express @xmath108 as a difference of two concave functions denoted @xmath110 and @xmath111 , i.e. , @xmath112 where @xmath113 @xmath114 clearly , we notice that @xmath110 is a concave function while @xmath111 is a convex function .",
