    "this is the eleventh paper of a series whose purpose is to obtain cepheid distances to galaxies that have produced supernovae of type ia ( sne  ia ) , thereby calibrating their absolute magnitudes at maximum light .",
    "the hubble diagram for sne  ia shows a dispersion ( read as magnitude residuals about a line of slope @xmath10 ) of less than 0.2 mag when certain second - parameter corrections are applied ( hamuy et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ; tripp 1998 ; phillips et al .",
    "1999 ; saha et al .",
    "1999 ; tripp & branch 1999 ; parodi et al . 2000 ; tammann , sandage & saha 2001 ) , the far - field value of the hubble constant is determined directly from the sne  ia hubble diagram once the mean absolute magnitude of sne  ia at maximum light is calibrated .",
    "clearly the resulting hubble constant is the global value , free from all local velocity anomalies .",
    "this route to @xmath11 through branch - normal sneia ( branch et al .",
    "1993 ; branch 2001 ) is the only method that in a _ single step _ directly bridges the relatively nearby distances from cepheids with distances well beyond those corresponding to recession velocities of @xmath12 .",
    "such large distances are required for the determination of the _ cosmic _ value of @xmath11 , so that the effect of streaming motions is minimized .",
    "magnitude residuals of less than 0.2 mag rms in the hubble diagram show that branch - normal sneia , once they are corrected for variations in decline rate and intrinsic color , are the best known standard candles .",
    "however , before the advent of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , one had to rely on other secondary distance indicators to obtain the luminosity calibration of sneia ( sandage & tammann 1982 ) , since the nearest galaxies that had hosted recorded sneia were beyond the range of ground based cepheid searches . with the use of _ hst",
    "_ , this step of using intermediate secondary distance indicators has been eliminated . as of this eleventh paper in our series , the peak luminosities of nine branch - normal sneia",
    "are now directly tied to cepheids . for these reasons",
    "we claim that the resulting value of @xmath11 is the cleanest and most direct of all the ones using the distance ladder methodology .",
    "the branch normal type ia sn 1998aq was discovered by m. armstrong ( hurst 1998 ) on 1998 april 13 , six days before maximum light ( see  5 ) .",
    "it appeared 18  west and 7  north of the center of ngc 3982 , which is a galaxy in the very busy region of the supergalactic plane in what was originally called the ursa major cloud ( humason et al .",
    "1956 , table  i ) .",
    "the region was later mapped into separate groups by many cartographers .",
    "the most complete mapping has been done by tully ( 1987 ) , who is the leading student of groups .",
    "he also summarized much of the earlier work , principally by de vaucouleurs ( 1975 ) .",
    "later work by nolthenius ( 1993 ) on groups is also particularly important to cite .",
    "what is now called the ursa major cluster is in the midst of the ursa major cloud ( see map 15 of the tully - fisher atlas , 1987 ) . the most convincing mapping of the region , and the separation of the ursa major cluster from the cloud , is by tully et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . following the thesis of verheijen ( 1997 ) .",
    "ngc 3982 lies near the extreme northern border of the cluster as delineated by verheijen and by tully et al .",
    "the galaxy is listed in the rsa ( sandage & tammann 1987 ) as of type sbc(r)ii - iii with a total blue apparent magnitude , corrected for galactic and internal absorption , of @xmath13 .",
    "tully lists the apparent magnitude , similarly corrected by his absorption precepts , as @xmath14 . a color image of this galaxy , created from the the hst @xmath15 and @xmath16 band images presented in this paper ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "membership in the the ursa major cluster is of no importance in calibrating the absolute magnitude at maximum of its daughter supernova , which is the object of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , our determination of the distance to the galaxy in  4 , does , of course , have relevance for comparing the distance to the ursa major cluster summarized by tully et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to be 15.5 mpc from other methods .",
    "this distance , along with their quoted distances of 15.6 mpc for the virgo cluster and 14.5 mpc for the fornax cluster , defines their short distance scale leading to their high value of @xmath17 ( pierce & tully 1988 ) .",
    "our distance to ngc 3982 from cepheids (  4 of this paper ) is 22.1 mpc .",
    "combined with the apparent magnitude at maximum of sn 1998aq and the absolute magnitudes at maximum light from eight previous sne  ia calibrators ( saha et al .",
    "1999 ; parodi et al .",
    "2000 ) leads us again to @xmath18 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "the hst observations of ngc  3982 are set out in  2 .",
    "discovery and photometry of the cepheids is described in  3 .",
    "the p - l relation and the resulting determination of the apparent as well as absorption - corrected distance moduli are in  4 .",
    "discussion of the available photometric data for sn 1998aq and the resulting calibration of its absolute magnitude is in  5 . in ",
    "6 we compare @xmath19 for sn 1998aq with the previously calibrated nine sne  ia , leading to our determination of @xmath11 using the supernova route .",
    "repeated images of a field that contains the entire visible region of the galaxy ngc  3982 were obtained using the wfpc2 ( @xcite ) on the _ hst _ over a 53 day period from 2000 march to may ( hst observing program number 8100 ) .",
    "the visible galaxy fits within the field of view of the wfpc2 , and a composite image including all four chips of the instrument is shown in fig .",
    "observations were made at 12 discrete epochs in @xmath0 passband , and at 5 epochs in the @xmath1 passband over the 53 day window .",
    "each epoch in each filter consists of 2 one - orbit duration exposures taken on successive orbits of the spacecraft .",
    "this allows the removal of cosmic rays by an anti - coincidence technique described by @xcite ( paper v ) .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "all exposures in this table are pairs of exposures on back to back space - craft orbits , each of 2500s duration .    the epochs were spaced strategically over the total duration to provide maximum leverage on detecting and finding periods of cepheid variables over the period range from 10 to 50 days .",
    "it should be remarked that it is highly desirable to keep all the observations at very nearly the same pointing as possible .",
    "we have managed to do this in the previous galaxies studied in this series . due to a combination of a lack of guide stars for this field at some spacecraft roll angles and the pointing constraints posed by the requirements for the solar panels , a large enough window for keeping the pointing orientation unchanged was not available in the present case .",
    "consequently , while the final 11 epochs are all obtained with essentially the same pointing ( to within a few pixels ) , the very first epoch ( @xmath0 filter only ) has a field orientation that is 12 degrees different from the remaining observations .",
    "the procedural details for processing images , combining the sub - exposures for each epoch while removing the bulk of the cosmic rays , as well as performing the photometry with a variant of dophot ( @xcite ) optimized for wfpc2 data has been given in paper  v. a subsequent improvement in deriving aperture corrections was detailed in @xcite ( paper  ix ) .",
    "since the same procedures were followed here , the details are not repeated .      in keeping with the precepts mentioned in paper  v , measurements in any one passband are expressed in the magnitude system defined by @xcite",
    "that is natural to the hst .",
    "specifically we mean the @xmath0 and @xmath1 `` ground system '' magnitudes .",
    "these calibrations were made with `` short '' exposures , which have since been shown to suffer from the effects of anomalous charge transfer in the ccd devices used ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is recognized that the effect of adopting the @xcite calibrations over - estimates the brightness by a few hundredths of a magnitude . in our previous papers of this series",
    ", we made a correction of 0.05 mag to both passbands to account for this effect .",
    "our current understanding of this situation is that the exact correction is procedure dependent ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the charge transfer anomaly has been shown to worsen with time due to exposure to radiation .",
    "thus the exact corrections depend additionally on when a particular data - set was obtained . while @xcite evaluated the appropriate corrections for short exposure data taken in late 1997 , that analysis does not directly predict the corrections appropriate for the @xcite calibration .",
    "the results of the bright star monitoring program indicate that the deterioration from 1994 to 1997 are unlikely to be significant .",
    "nevertheless , the results of future study ( which includes some of the authors of this paper ) could adjust the photometric zero points at the 0.03 mag level .",
    "in this paper we continue to show all @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes on the @xcite system",
    ". transformed magnitudes in @xmath15 and @xmath16 are shown with the 0.05 magnitude corrections , which is consistent with the final numbers shown in the previous papers of this series .",
    "the data can be updated for better corrections as they become available .",
    "the measured magnitudes and reported errors at all available epochs in @xmath0 were used to identify variable stars using the method described by @xcite .",
    "the procedural details specific to the wfpc2 data in this series of papers has been given in paper  v , @xcite ( paper  vi ) and @xcite ( paper  viii ) .",
    "they are not repeated here .",
    "all variable stars that were definitely so identified , are marked in fig .",
    ". however some of the variables are not visible on these charts due to their extreme faintness combined with the variation in the background surface brightness on these images .",
    "the positions of these objects , as they appear in the images identified in the hst archives as @xmath20 and @xmath21 are listed in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "the photometry on the @xcite `` short exposure '' calibration system for the final list of 26 variable stars is presented in table  [ tbl3 ] for each epoch and each filter .",
    "the periods were determined with the @xcite by using only the @xmath0 passband data .",
    "aliasing is not a serious problem for periods between 10 and 55 days because the observing strategy incorporated an optimum timing scheme as before in this series .",
    "the resulting light curves in the @xmath0 passband , together with periods and mean magnitudes ( determined by integrating the light curves , converted to intensities , and then converting the average back to magnitudes , and called the `` phase - weighted intensity average '' in @xcite ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , plotted in the order of descending period .",
    "all of the variable stars identified in this manner have periods and light curves consistent with being cepheids .",
    "there is a range in the quality of the light curves  both in terms of the scatter in the individual points , as well as in the implied shapes .",
    "the object c3-v2 , for instance , has an extremely small amplitude , even though its variability appears quite definite in signal - to - noise terms .",
    "it is possible that this is a blend of two stars , one of which may be a cepheid . thus sorting through the quality of each putative cepheid",
    "is a necessary task , and is described later in this sub - section .    the available data for the variables in @xmath1 were folded with the ephemerides derived above using the @xmath0 data .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "all of the objects detected as variables in @xmath0 were recovered in at least 3 epochs in the @xmath1 observations .",
    "the mean magnitudes in @xmath1 ( integrated as intensities over the cycle ) were obtained from the procedure of @xcite whereby each @xmath1 magnitude at a randomly sampled phase is converted to a mean value @xmath22 using amplitude and phase information from the more complete @xmath0 light curves .",
    "note that each available observation of @xmath1 is used independently to derive a mean magnitude .",
    "hence , the scatter of the individual values about the adopted mean @xmath1 value is an _ external _ measure of the uncertainty in determining @xmath22 .",
    "it is this external measure of the uncertainty that is retained and propagated in the later calculations .",
    "the prescription given in paper  v for assigning the light - curve quality index @xmath23 ( that ranges from 0 to 6 ) was used . in this scheme ,",
    "a grade ( @xmath24 ) is given for the quality of the @xmath0 light curves , with additional points ( @xmath24 ) for the evenness in phase coverage of the five ( or fewer ) @xmath1 observation epochs , and up to three additional points ( @xmath25 ) for the amplitude and phase coherence of the @xmath1 observations compared with the @xmath0 light curve .",
    "hence , a quality index of 6 indicates the best possible light curve set in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a quality index of 2 or less indicates near fatal flaws such as apparent phase incoherence in the two passbands .",
    "this is generally the indication that object confusion by crowding and/or contamination by background is likely .",
    "the weighting scheme puts a lot of weight on how well matched the few @xmath1 observations are to the light curve implied by the @xmath0 data .",
    "this is by design , since if reddening effects are to be deciphered from the cepheid colors , the fidelity of the colors must be established , since color uncertainties dominate the error in the de - reddened distance modulus .",
    "table  [ tbl4 ] lists the characteristics of all 26 putative cepheids mentioned above",
    ". the @xmath0 and @xmath1 instrumental magnitudes of table  [ tbl3 ] have been converted to the johnson @xmath15 and cousins ( cape ) @xmath16 standard photometric system by the color equations used in previous papers of this series , as set out in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of paper  v , based on the transformations of @xcite . in addition , as discussed in the previous sub - section , a value of 0.05 mag has been added to each of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 magnitudes to correct the @xcite scales for the charge - transfer inefficiency problems .",
    "this correction is consistent with that used in all previous papers of this series , except that in the previous papers , the correction was applied at the end , to the distance moduli , and not in the tables corresponding to table  [ tbl4 ] here .",
    "a parallel photometry procedure was carried through by one of us ( aed ) using the hstphot stellar photometry package @xcite .",
    "the images were masked using the data quality images , and pairs of images combined for cosmic ray removal using hstphot s _ crclean _ algorithm , producing eleven f555w and five f814w images ( all 5000s ) at the primary pointing , and a twelfth f555w image ( also 5000s ) at the secondary pointing .",
    "the _ multiphot _ algorithm was used to simultaneously photometer all sixteen images at the primary pointing .",
    "because of the distance to ngc 3982 , it was extremely difficult to locate individual stars for use as psf stars .",
    "instead , the photometry was run twice : the first time using a library psf calculated from tiny tim ( @xcite ) models , and the second time adding a residual ( calculated from the stars found in the first run ) to the psf .",
    "this process was also completed on the single image at the secondary pointing .",
    "to arrive at our final hstphot photometry , we used the @xcite formulae to make cte corrections and calibrate to the standard @xmath26 system , and matched the secondary pointing photometry to the primary pointing , producing instrumental and standard magnitudes for each star at each epoch .",
    "the post - photometry procedure to detect and characterize the cepheids was essentially identical to that used with the dophot photometry results .",
    "the main differences involved the minimum acceptable photometry quality used  the hstphot analysis required that stars be found with @xmath27 and @xmath28 in order to avoid blends and stars for which good photometry was impossible .",
    "we also required that a star have at least 10 such good photometry measurements to be considered in the analysis .",
    "the quality parameters in the hstphot - based analysis range from 0 - 4 ( rather than 0 - 6 ) , but are based on similar criteria ",
    "cleanness of both the f555w and f814w light curves , coherence between the light curves , and phase coverage .    of the 26 variables found by dophot",
    ", 13 were independently discovered from the hstphot analysis .",
    "ten of these 13 common cepheids have hstphot quality parameters of 3 or 4 .",
    "the periods and mean @xmath15 and @xmath16 magnitudes derived from the hstphot measurements alone for these 13 cepheids are given in table  [ tbl5 ] .",
    "the results from the hstphot based procedure are used to estimate the distance modulus in  4.3 , and used as a sanity check for the results from dophot .",
    "as in the previous papers of this series we adopt the p - l relation in @xmath15 from madore & freedman ( 1991 ) as    @xmath29    whose companion relation in @xmath16 is @xmath30 the zero point of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is based on an assumed lmc modulus of 18.50 .",
    "the p - l relations in @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the 26 cepheids in table  [ tbl4 ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ figplr1 ] .",
    "the filled circles show objects with periods greater than 20 days that have a quality index of 3 or higher .",
    "the solid lines show the canonical slopes of the p - l relations in @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the vertical offset for apparent distance moduli @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "these values were chosen to be in visual conformity with the points shown as filled circles ( they are not intended as a formal derivation of distance ) . the expected spread in each of the pass - bands due to the finite width of the instability strip ( @xcite )",
    "is indicated by the flanking dashed lines .",
    "the observed scatter of the data outside these envelope lines is due to the combination of ( 1 ) measuring and systematic errors due to background and contamination , ( 2 ) the random error of photon statistics , ( 3 ) the large effects of the variable extinction evident from the dust lanes seen in the images , and ( 4 ) objects mis - identified as cepheids .",
    "the variables with periods shorter than 20 days can be seen to fall systematically brighter .",
    "this is due to a bias at the faint end because cepheids at short periods that are at the faint end of the intrinsic scatter about the mean p - l relation and fall below the detection limit in brightness do not populate the p - l relation .",
    "this adversely affects the fitting of the p - l relation .",
    "a cut off that rejects objects shorter than 20 days is a sensible precaution in this case , and such a period cut does not introduce a bias of its own .      for a first estimate , using @xmath33 ( @xcite ) along with the very preliminary apparent moduli in @xmath15 and @xmath16 of 32.00 and 31.90 respectively as estimated above yields a dereddened modulus @xmath34 . to explore the presence of differential extinction and to treat the data accordingly , we use the tools developed in paper  v and further developed in subsequent papers of this series .    for each cepheid",
    "we calculate the apparent distance moduli separately in @xmath15 and in @xmath16 from the p - l relations of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and the observed @xmath35 and @xmath36 magnitudes from table  [ tbl4 ] .",
    "these apparent distance moduli , called @xmath37 and @xmath38 in columns ( 7 ) and ( 8) of table  [ tbl4 ] , are calculated by @xmath39 and @xmath40 they are the same as equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of paper  v.    if the differences between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 moduli are due solely to reddening , and if the dependence of the reddening curve on wavelength is the normal standard dependence as in the galaxy , then the true modulus @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ratio of total to selective absorption , @xmath44 .",
    "this is equation ( 8) of paper  v. however , equation ( 5 ) is valid only if the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is due to extinction , not to correlated measuring errors .",
    "the values of @xmath45 are listed in column 9 of table  [ tbl4 ] .",
    "these would be the true moduli , as corrected for normal extinction , assuming that there are no systematic measuring errors .",
    "the total rms uncertainty for each @xmath45 value is listed in column 10 .",
    "this uncertainty includes contributions from the estimated random measuring errors in the mean @xmath15 and @xmath16 magnitudes , ( in columns 4 and 6 ) , as propagated through the de - reddening procedure , as well as the uncertainty associated with the intrinsic width of the p - l relation ( i.e. a given cepheid may not be on the mean ridge - line of the p - l relation ) as well as a ten percent uncertainty in the estimated period .",
    "the de - reddening procedure amplifies the measuring errors .",
    "therefore many cepheids are needed to beat down these large errors ( notice some very large values in column 10 ) in any final value of the modulus .",
    "the values shown in column 10 of table  4 were calculated using equation ( 18 ) of @xcite , and also correspond to @xmath46 as defined in paper  v.    from the data in table  [ tbl4 ] , the unweighted mean de - reddened modulus @xmath47 for all cepheids with periods greater than 20 days with @xmath48 is @xmath49 mag , and the weighted ( by @xmath50 value is also @xmath51 mag .",
    "the average ( unweighted ) _ apparent _ modulus @xmath52 for this sample of cepheids is @xmath53 and the corresponding value for @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "this implies @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where the symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "we mention again that the derived @xmath45 values are only meaningful under the assumption that the differences between @xmath37 and @xmath38 are due to reddening alone , in the absence of appreciable systematic and correlated measuring errors , or when the errors for @xmath58 _ are distributed symmetrically_. if asymmetrical errors in @xmath15 and @xmath16 dominate over differential reddening , the @xmath45 derived via equation ( 5 ) _ will be systematically in error_.    a diagnostic diagram to test for the relative presence of bona - fide differential extinction versus scatter due to measuring errors alone was devised in paper  v , and used in subsequent papers of this series .",
    "we do not repeat its description .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ figdiag ] for the cepheids in ngc  3982 .",
    "the filled circles again show cepheids with periods greater than 20 days and with @xmath48 .",
    "the solid line indicates the reddening vector for the p - l ridge line , if the true ( de - reddened ) distance modulus is @xmath59 which is close to the initial estimate for the distance modulus made above .",
    "the dashed lines show the bounds due to the intrinsic dispersion of the p - l relation as explained in paper  v. the slope of the lines is @xmath60 , in accordance with the reddening law of scheffler ( 1982 ) .",
    "the scatter in fig .",
    "[ figdiag ] does not lie within the reddening track . translating the reddening band in this figure",
    "would not materially reduce the number of points that would spill out of it",
    ". there may be some differential reddening , but there is very significant scatter orthogonal to the reddening track , indicating that the range in @xmath37 and @xmath38 values is driven more by photometry errors rather than by extinction alone .",
    "as mentioned above , and discussed in previous papers of this series , any skewness in the distribution of measurement errors contributes to a systematic error in the de - reddened modulus for the galaxy .      since we have shown that the scatter in observed colors of the cepheids is significantly due to observational errors , we can try to exclude color outliers by selecting out objects whose measured colors are extreme for cepheids . to do this",
    ", we utilize the period - color ( p - c ) relation for cepheids , which follows immediately from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the intrinsic color of a cepheid on the ridge line of the p - l relation . note that the intrinsic scatter in color is small : the delimiting lines shown in fig  [ figplr1 ] map to lines 0.08 mag above and below the line defined above by eqn .",
    "( [ pc1 ] ) .",
    "the ridge line summarized in @xcite from independent data by @xcite , @xcite & @xcite is essentially identical to the above , as shown in @xcite ( paper  x ) .",
    "the observed colors can be reddened by dust , and scatter will be introduced both , by differential extinction as well as measurement errors .    we expect to see some cepheids that are reddened very little because they are on the near side of the disk .",
    "others may have substantial reddening since they are seen through the disk , and possibly through dust lanes .",
    "the rationale for a color - cut is that while bona - fide extinction should not affect the de - reddened distance modulus irrespective of how the data are cut in color , objects with large errors and objects mis - classified as cepheids , which _ do _ affect the modulus , can be identified and rejected .",
    "the p - c relation for the data at hand is shown in fig  [ figpcrel ] .",
    "as before , the filled circles indicate cepheids with @xmath63 and @xmath48 .    a plot of individual de - reddened moduli @xmath45 vs. color deviation @xmath64 from the fiducial pc relation for the data at hand is shown in fig  [ figpcdev ] , again where filled circles indicate cepheids with @xmath63 and @xmath48 .",
    "this diagram graphically demonstrates that the derived distance is a strong function of the measured color , showing again that the data are dominated by measurement errors .",
    "an inspection of this figure indicates that values of @xmath65 less than @xmath66 or greater than @xmath67 are almost certainly outliers : rejecting these and working with the 14 cepheids with @xmath63 and @xmath48 yields a de - reddened modulus @xmath68 .",
    "this cut corresponds to a region delimited by a line 0.2 mag below and a line 0.4 mag above the ridge line of the fidicial pc relation shown in fig  [ figpcrel ] .",
    "a way to arrive at a less arbitrary cut is to try various cuts by color , and choose the one(s ) that produce the p - l relations with the least scatter in both passbands .",
    "following such a path , we arrive at a cut with @xmath69 , which corresponds to a line 0.2 mag below and a line 0.3 mag above the ridge line of the fiducial pc relation .",
    "this cut yields @xmath70 , using the 12 acceptable cepheids that also have @xmath63 and @xmath48 .",
    "we consider here the sample of cepheids found using the hstphot photometry , as described in  3.2 .",
    "recall that 13 cepheids were reported , all in common with the dophot based discoveries .",
    "a different grading scheme with grades from 0 - 4 was used , and assigned independently . using the 10 cepheids which have @xmath71 and grade 3 or better , and computing the de - reddened moduli @xmath45 we find that c1-v2 is a clear outlier ( too large a modulus ) . using the remaining 9 cepheids , we arrive at a mean ( unweighted ) de - reddened distance modulus @xmath72 .",
    "this is within the errors of the similar calculation for dophot based cepheids .",
    "this subsample of 9 cepheids with hstphot photometry gives @xmath73 and @xmath74 , implying @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we are satisfied that the results from hstphot are consistent within the errors with the dophot results , and having used this as a sanity check , proceed with the dophot values .",
    "the various cuts on the dophot sample of cepheids were discussed in  4.2 .",
    "the results do not change significantly within the errors irrespective of the subsample used .",
    "we therefore adopt the most robust cut of all , which is the one with @xmath77 and @xmath48 , which was shown to yield :    @xmath78    and @xmath79    the apparent distance modulus in the @xmath15 band is given by    @xmath80    looking back over the cepheid measurements made in this series of papers , we note that the photometry has been most troublesome in the those galaxies where the disk is inclined to the line of sight .",
    "the 2 farthest galaxies of this study , ngc  4639 and ngc  3982 , presented no photometric inconsistencies .",
    "both these galaxies present face - on disks .",
    "by contrast , it was necessary to examine the data most critically for ngc  4527 and ngc  3627 , which are both closer in distance modulus by at least a magnitude .",
    "however their disks are very inclined , thus presenting a higher column density of stars which may be contributing more severely to contamination and confusion noise .",

    "the absence of nad absorption lines in its spectrum ( ayani & yamaoka 1998 ) may be taken as a hint in this direction .",

    "it seems therefore that sn1998aq indeed suffers very little absorption in its parent galaxy .",

    "their questionable distance for sn1972e in ngc5253 therefore contributes with higher weight .",

    "the difference @xmath164 translates into a reduction of the moduli of the distant sneia by @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "if we correct for this mis - match in color , their value for @xmath127 is reduced by another 2.6 percent .",
    "( 3 ) the calibrating sneia lie in spirals and hence have slower decline rates than the distant sneia which come in all types of galaxies . in the case of freedman et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) the mean difference amounts to @xmath168 .",
    "this value must be multiplied by the wavelength - dependent slope of the @xmath124-luminosity relation to allow a fair comparison between calibrators and distant sneia .",
    "the authors have adopted the rather steep slope of hamuy et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , yet an enlarged sample of sneia gives a significantly smaller slope ( parodi et  al .",
