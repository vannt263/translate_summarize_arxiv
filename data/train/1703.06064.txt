    "this can be understood as a motivation to explore this scenario on the lattice as valid candidate theory of tev scale compositeness .    finally , coming back to the potential impact of lattice input , we show the scan of top partners assuming a lattice calculation input of @xmath103 .",
    "this results in a correlation of the top partner spectrum with @xmath5 , fig .",
    "[ fig : toppartners ] and indicates that an observation of top partners in the near future at the lhc can not only provide an input to a more comprehensive investigation on the lattice , but , more importantly can potentially rule out the model of eqs .   and   directly",
    "the observation of a sm - like higgs and no additional evidence of physics beyond the sm provides no hint towards a more fundamental theory of the tev scale .",
    "non - minimal theories of higgs compositeness have always been attractive solutions to solve this puzzle , but recently they have received particular attention as the possibility of uv - complete models paves the way for applying non - perturbative techniques .",
    "such a programme needs to be informed by the results of the lhc as collider constraints can be understood in terms of the uv - theory s lecs . in this work ,",
    "we provide the latest constraints from higgs - like measurements as well as from searches for additional pseudo nambu - goldstone weak triplets with exotic charges predicted by the scenario of  @xcite .    including constraints from the literature on the exotic states that are relevant for our analysis of lecs of this particular scenario",
    ", we find that the latter is largely unconstrained at this stage in the lhc programme .",
    "extrapolating to @xmath220 , the weak exotics searches are capable of limiting the effective theory s parameter space",
    ". in particular , the increasing precision on the 125 gev higgs couplings ( see e.g.  @xcite ) will allow us to explore the coupling strength deviations in the @xmath221-range , which will provide stringent constraints ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] ) on the model .",
    "direct searches are not constraining on the top partner mass @xmath222 but when combined with lattice determinations the situation may change .",
    "for instance , the prediction of the hypercolor baryon mass @xmath223 , in units of the decay constants @xmath5 , provides directly falsifiable predictions on the top quark partner spectra as shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : toppartners ] . in the longer term ,",
    "the computation of the higgs potential parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 provides first principle constraints on the viability of the model against the higgs mass and higgs decay channel measurements ( cf .",
    "[ fig : abplot ] ) .",
    "in particular the determination of only one of these parameters can exclude the model whereas both parameters are needed to confirm it in this sector .",

    "in this section we briefly review the calculation underpinning the loop - induced decays of the additional neutral scalars in the model .",
    "after diagonalising the top- and bottom mass mixing matrices , the scalar as well as vectorial couplings will be in general non - diagonal in the top and bottom partner spaces ( and not necessarily purely vectorial)w .",
    "this leads to a multi - scale decay amplitude that can be pictorially represented by the sum over feynman diagrams indicated in fig .",

    "this result is familiar from the sm within which top and bottom loop contributions renormalise the tree - level @xmath234 operators .",
    "there is no such interaction in the eft for the non - higgs states and the considered order in chiral perturbation theory due to the symmetry of the underlying uv theory .",
    "however , these symmetries are spurious ( e.g.  leading to @xmath235 obtaining a mass from a coleman - weinberg potential ) and quantum corrections will excite all operators that are allowed by explicitly intact symmetries .",
    "hence , they will also excite the absent operator @xmath236 .",
    "it is interesting to mention another similarity with the @xmath35 triplet scenario of  @xcite here . in this model",
    ", the requirement of custodial invariance identifies the real and complex @xmath35 triplet vacuum expectation value .",
    "this identification is broken at the quantum level signalised by the appearance of additional uv singularities that require the introduction of independent bare quantities  @xcite ( while the renormalised quantities can be identified as input to the renormalisation procedure ) .    from a technical perspective",
    "the problem encountered in the calculation of the decay amplitude is similar . we are forced to introduce a bare operator @xmath236 and supply the underlying uv physics through a renormalisation condition ( as part of a minimal set of eft input parameters ) .",
    "the counter term amplitude in our case can be written as ( using @xmath237 and multiplicative renormalisation of the quantum fields ) turns eq .   into using @xmath238 with the ellipses denoting finite terms",
    "@xmath239 .",
    "to reflect the symmetry breaking pattern that underpins our eft formulation , we need to provide input data to the renormalisation procedure .",
    "this is guided by the eft not allowing the dimension three operator due to the approximate shift symmetry of the nambu - goldstone @xmath235 .",
    "all interactions generated by loops that violate this symmetry ( and eventually creates a mass of @xmath235 ) are higher order in the eft expansion  @xcite .",
    "a suitable renormalisation condition is therefore a vanishing coefficient @xmath240 .",
    "this fixes the renormalisation constant @xmath241 and renders the amplitude uv finite ."
