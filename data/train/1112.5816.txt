    "while the signature of rotation - powered pulsars is their pulsed emission , bulk of the rotational energy is going to power a relativistic outflow of magnetohydrodynamic wind particles with lorentz factors up to @xmath0 . although pulsar winds can not be observed directly , their presence can be inferred through their interaction with the interstellar surroundings .",
    "if the wind reaches a termination shock , a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) is formed .",
    "the term pwn had been originally referred to the shocked emission associated with young and powerful pulsars ( e.g. crab ) where the wind is effectively confined by the magnetic fields of the surrounding supernova remnants and relativistic leptons reach high energy densities which make these nebulae usually luminous synchrotron sources in the radio and x - ray regimes .",
    "a different class of pwne which is associated with older and less powerful pulsars is bow - shock nebulae .",
    "these nebulae are not embedded in supernova remnants but interact directly with the interstellar medium ( ism ) . if the pulsar has a high velocity , the nebula is confined by the ram pressure of the ism and forms the typical bow - shock structure .",
    "the bow - shock size is determined by the balance between the wind and the ism ram pressure . even in this",
    "old and less powerful pulsars , there is a significant fraction of the whole pulsar spin - down power which is going to feed the pulsar wind ( see bucciantini & bandiera 2001 ) .    among all the pulsars with pwne detected ,",
    "psr  b2224 + 65  is one of the most interesting system .",
    "this pulsar has a rotational period and a period derivative of @xmath1  s and @xmath2  s  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this suggests psr  b2224 + 65  has a spin - down age of @xmath4 years .",
    "the spin parameters imply a spin - down luminosity and a surface dipole magnetic field strength of @xmath5  erg  s@xmath3 and @xmath6  g respectively . concerning its distance , while the radio dispersion measure implies a value of 1.86 kpc ( cf .",
    "cordes & lazio 2002 ) , chatterjee & cordes ( 2004 ) found that by modeling the head of the shocked emission in h@xmath7 the pulsar distance could be as close as 1 kpc .    hui & becker ( 2007 ) have examined its x - ray properties with the chandra data taken in october 2000 .",
    "brief results of the same observation have also been reported by wong et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and zavlin & pavlov ( 2004 ) . despite the photon statistics",
    "is limited in this data set , the spectral analysis suggests that the bulk of the x - ray emission from psr  b2224 + 65  is non - thermal .",
    "an independent analysis that includes also the second epoch chandra observations taken in august - october 2006 has confirmed the non - thermal nature of the x - rays detected at the pulsar position ( johnson & wang 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the large frame time ( i.e. 3.2 sec ) of these chandra observations do not allow us to constrain the temporal properties of the pulsar .",
    "therefore , with the existing data , we can not determine whether the bulk of these observed x - rays are originated from the pulsar magnetosphere or from the pwn .",
    "the proper motion of psr  b2224 + 65  is among the largest in the currently known pulsar population with a transverse velocity of @xmath8  km  s@xmath3 ( harrison , lyne & anderson 1993 ) .",
    "its shock interaction with the ism produces the most well - known _ guitar nebula _ as observed in h@xmath7 ( cordes et al .",
    "although no evidence for the x - ray emission can be found in the region of the h@xmath7 nebula , an x - ray jet apparently associated with psr  b2224 + 65  has been detected by chandra ( hui & becker 2007 ; wong et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the most peculiar fact of this jet is that its orientation deviates by @xmath9 from the pulsar s proper motion direction .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is also found to be non - thermal .",
    "kargaltsev & pavlov ( 2008 ) have argued that this jet - like feature may be associated with a nearby point source instead of with psr  b2224 + 65 .",
    "however , this possibility has been ruled out by a recent analysis of the multi - epoch chandra observations .",
    "johnson & wang ( 2010 ) have found that the sharp leading edge have a proper motion consistent with that of the pulsar , which secures the association between the jet and psr  b2224 + 65 .",
    "different pictures have been proposed to explain this x - ray jet ( e.g. bandiera 2008 ; johnson & wang 2010 ) . however , there is still no consensus on its nature .    to further investigate the nature of the x - rays from the position of psr  b2224",
    "+ 65  and its enigmatic jet , a dedicated follow - up observation with improved temporal resolution and photon statistic is needed . in this paper , we present a deep xmm - newton observation in order to study this extreme system in details . in  2 , we describe the details of the xmm - newton observation and the data reduction . in  3 and  4",
    ", we present the results of the x - ray analysis and the search for the @xmath10ray emission from this system respectively .",

    "the data used in this investigation were obtained with the * e*uropean * p*hoton * i*maging * c*amera ( epic ) aboard xmm - newton ( jansen et al .",

    "the pn ccd was operated in small - window mode with a thin filter to block optical stray light .",

    "the mos1/2 ccds were setup to operate in full - window mode with a thin filter in each camera .",
    "the aimpoint of the satellite in this observation is ra=@xmath11 and dec=@xmath12 ( j2000 ) . with the most updated instrumental calibration ,",

    "this provides us with opportunities for an accurate timing analysis .",
    "we then created filtered event files for the energy range 0.5 kev to 10 kev for all epic instruments and selected only those events for which the pattern was between @xmath13 for mos cameras and @xmath14 for the pn camera .",
    "we further cleaned the data by accepting only the good times when sky background was low and removed all events potentially contaminated by bad pixels . after the filtering",

    "x - ray images of the @xmath15 field around psr  b2224 + 65  as obtained by mos1/2 and pn camera are displayed in figure  [ xmm_img ] .",
    "both image have been firstly produced with a binsize of @xmath16 which is subsequently smoothed with a gaussian with a kernel size of @xmath17 .",
    "both the pulsar and the jet can be clearly seen .    for investigating the spatial variation of the x - ray intensity of the jet",

    "the root mean square ( rms ) positional uncertainty is @xmath29 of the optical source in each coordinate based on the astrometric correction with 53 reference sources in guide star catalog 2 ( lasker et al .",

    "the x - ray emission from the pulsar position appears to be slightly elongated for @xmath34 behind proper motion direction as illustrated by the arrow in figure  [ xmm_img ] . in both mos1/2 and pn images",
    ", this putative feature apparently has the same orientation .",
    "however , the elongation of this feature is close to the edge of the spatial resolution of xmm - newton .",

    ", all the epic data are found to be not affected by ccd pileup . for psr  b2224 + 65",
    ", we extracted its source spectrum from circles with a radius of @xmath36 centered at the point source position in both mos1/2 and pn cameras respectively .",

    "we have firstly examined the data obtained from each camera individually and found that all the spectral parameters inferred from different cameras are consistent within @xmath20 uncertainties . in order to tightly constrain the spectral parameters",
    ", we fitted the data obtained from three cameras simultaneously for the individual analysis of psr  b2224 + 65  and its jet . according to the photon statistics , we grouped each spectrum dynamically so as to achieve the same signal - to - noise rate in each dataset .",

    ", we have repeated the maximum - likelihood analysis and the ts map computation . with the contribution from these two serendipitous sources subtracted , the ts value at the position of psr  b2224 + 65  essentially drops to zero and no residual emission can be identified in the ts map .",

    "insets in fig .",
    "[ xmm_img ] ) .",
    "although we can not confirm its extent unambiguously with the existing data , its orientation is interesting and worth discussing .",
    "x - ray tails have been found to be associated with many pulsars ( see kargaltsev & pavlov 2010 for a recent review ) .",
    "the tails are usually oriented in the opposite direction of pulsar motion and behind the bow - shock , therefore it is interpreted as the flow of particles coming out of the ram - pressure dominated pwn . in this scenario , the x - ray emission from psr  b2224 + 65  is originated from the synchrotron radiation from the wind particles accelerated at the termination shock .",
    "this is consistent with the unpulsed non - thermal emission inferred from this observation . for the synchrotron emitting leptons of lorentz factor",
    "@xmath102 distribute as @xmath114 , the observed photon index of @xmath115 from the pulsar location is consistent with the value expected from the fast - cooling scenario , @xmath116 , for the electron index lies within a typical range of @xmath117 ( cheng , taam , & wang 2006 ) .",
    "this putative feature , which has an extent of @xmath34 in epic images , should be resolved by chandra . nevertheless , in reexamining the archival chandra data , its extent can not confirm .",
    "on the other hand , the photon distribution of psr  b2224 + 65  in the merged chandra image is slightly deviated from a point source with the deformation also toward the direction behind the pulsar proper motion .",
    "although the evidence for the extended source can not be conclusive with the existing data , the compact feature suggested by the chandra data can possibly be the portion of the highest surface brightness .",
    "complex structures of bow - shock pwne have been observed in other systems .",
    "for example , xmm - newton observation of a nearby pulsar psr  b1929 + 10 has revealed a long x - ray tail of several arc - minutes ( becker et al .",
    "apart from confirming the detection of this long trail , a follow - up chandra observation has further resolved a brighter but more compact feature with an extent of @xmath118 around the pulsar ( hui & becker 2008 ) . for a further investigation of psr  b2224 + 65 , a dedicated deep chandra observation , which simultaneously provides",
    "a sub - arcsecond spatial resolution and a photon statistic comparable with this xmm - newton observation , is the only way to confirm or refute this suggested feature .",
    "while this compact feature is still questionable , the evidence for the @xmath119 long jet is unambiguous .",
    "although all the x - ray studies suggest its non - thermal nature , its physical origin remains to be obscure .",
    "very recently , a collimated @xmath120 long x - ray feature has been discovered from a radio - quiet @xmath10ray pulsar psr  j0357 + 3205 ( de luca et al .",
    "2011 ) which is very similar to the jet of psr  b2224 + 65 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the observed properties between these two systems .",
    "the spin - down luminosity of psr  j0357 + 3205 , @xmath121  erg / s , is @xmath30 times higher than that of psr  b2224 + 65 , but it is the lowest among all known non - recycled @xmath10ray pulsars .",
    "the low column absorption suggests it is a nearby pulsar with a distance of only a few hundred parsec .",
    "assuming there is no inclination with respect to the sky plane , this suggests the physical extent of the trail associated with psr  j0357 + 3205 at the order of @xmath122  pc which is similar to the case of psr  b2224 + 65 . in both cases , there is no evidence of spectral variation along the feature . for a distance of 500 pc , the x - ray conversion efficiency @xmath123 of its trail in @xmath49",
    "kev is @xmath124 . adopting a distance of 1  kpc for psr  b2224 + 65",
    ", @xmath123 of its jet in the same energy band is found to be @xmath125 which is an order larger than that for psr  j0357 + 3205 .",
    "this might be why the jet of psr  b2224 + 65  can still be detected in spite of its larger distance .    following de luca et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we estimate the highest achievable energy of synchrotron - radiating particles injected by psr  b2224 + 65 .",
    "first , we assume the highest energy of the electrons / positrons can be gained is comparable with maximum potential drop in the magnetosphere , which is @xmath126 for an aligned pulsar ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) . similar to the case of psr  j0357 + 3205 , this results in a maximum lorentz factor of @xmath127 . in the presence of a magnetic field , these particles will radiate synchrotron emission with characteristic frequency of @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the local magnetic field strength in the emission region in units of microgauss .",
    "adopted a typical magnetic field at an order of @xmath130 g , @xmath131 implies a synchrotron photon energy at the order of @xmath132  kev .",
    "one difficulty for the synchrotron scenario is that it requires the lorentz factor of the emitting particles to achieve the same order of @xmath131 so as to produce x - rays at a few kev . on the other hand ,",
    "inverse compton ( ic ) scattering between the relativistic particles and the relic photons appears to be more viable in producing the observed x - rays .",
    "we note that the energy density of the relic photons is at the order of @xmath133  erg  @xmath134 , which is comparable with the magnetic energy density for a field strength of @xmath135 g .",
    "therefore the ic power can not be ignored . in the ic scenario ,",
    "the required lorentz factor to produce @xmath97  kev photons is only at the order of @xmath136 which is much easier to achieve .",
    "the major difficulty for explaining the x - ray jet of psr  b2224 + 65  in the context of pwn comes from its orientation with respect to the pulsar s proper motion .",
    "the jet protrudes from the pulsar and extends toward northwest , which makes an angle of @xmath9 from the proper motion direction of the pulsar ( cf .",
    "[ xmm_img ] ) .",
    "this peculiar orientation makes the bow - shock interpretation questionable as this scenario requires the nebular emission lies in an opposite direction of the pulsar s velocity vector . in view of this difficulty , different explanations for the nature of the jet association with psr  b2224",
    "+ 65  have been proposed , ranging from the magnetically confinement of relativistic particles leaking from the bow - shock ( bandiera 2008 ) to a picture similar to the agn jet outflow ( johnson & wang 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is no consensus on its physical origin yet .",
    "since the extended feature of psr  j0357 + 3205 is akin to that of psr  b2224 + 65 , a comparative analysis between these two systems might provide us a deeper insight on the nature of their jets . while the distance and the proper motion direction of psr  b2224 + 65   are well - constrained , these are the most important parameters to be determined in further investigation of psr  j0357 + 3205 .",
    "these would enable a more reliable estimations of its energetic and most importantly the orientation of the jet with respect to the pulsar s space velocity , which will allow us to ascertain if these two systems have a similar physical origin .",
    "psr  b2224 + 65  is certainly one of the most spectacular neutron stars regarding its motion through space as its transverse velocity , @xmath8  km  s@xmath3 , is among the highest in the currently known pulsar population . on the other hand",
    ", the well measured bow shock with its inclination in the plane of the sky suggests a negligible radial velocity component ( chatterjee & cordes 2004 ) which has been confirmed recently by tetzlaff et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who suggest the origin of psr  b2224 + 65  to lie within the cygnus ob3 association or a small massive cluster nearby .",
    "this origin indicates a small radial velocity of @xmath137  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the proposed kinematic age of @xmath138 myr is consistent with a characteristic pulsar age of @xmath139  myr ( hobbs et al .",

    "the smallest separation @xmath153 between psr  b2224 + 65  and hip 99580 that is found after 15 million monte - carlo runs is @xmath154  pc . between 25  pc and 35  pc distance from the centre of cyg ob9 , ophiuchi , see hoogerwerf et al .",

    "the first part of the distribution of the separations @xmath153 between psr  b2224 + 65  and hip 99580 of these runs is consistent with the hypothesis that both stars once were at the same position @xmath155  myr in the past ( see figure  [ histo ] ) .",
    "although only a small fraction of runs yield small separations @xmath156 between the stars as well as the centre of cyg ob9 the scenario seems likely considering the errors on the parameters involved ( distance @xmath141 , proper motion components @xmath157 and @xmath158 , radial velocity @xmath159 of both stars ) .",

    "2001 and tetzlaff et al .",
    "2010 ) ; however , since psr  b2224 + 65  and hip 99580 are far more distant from the sun than psr  b1929 + 10 and @xmath160 oph ( the error on the distance is larger by about one to two orders of magnitude ) , this is to be expected .    in figure",
    "[ correlation ] , we show the correlations between the astrometric parameters which were used as input for the 2540 runs for which both , psr  b2224 + 65  and the runaway star hip 99580 , were situated between 25  pc and 35  pc from the centre of cyg ob9 . for the runaway star only little correlation between @xmath161 and @xmath159",
    "can be seen and the most probable values of all parameters fall clearly within the error bars . whereas for the pulsar there is a strong correlation between @xmath161 and @xmath159 .",
    "this is expected since an increase in distance ( decrease in @xmath161 ) can be compensated for by a larger radial velocity @xmath159 and vice versa .",
    "if psr  b2224 + 65  and the runaway star hip 99580 were at the same place 0.65  myr ago in cyg ob9 , i.e. once were in the same multiple system , the present distance of psr  b2224 + 65  needs to be @xmath162  kpc .",
    "hence , we can confirm previous findings by chatterjee & codes ( 2004 ) which concludes the pulsar have a distance to the sun of @xmath122  kpc .",

    "however , only a tiny fraction of runs would then yield small separations between hip 99580 and psr  b2224 + 65  making the bss scenario unlikely .",
    "but note that both radial velocities can be correct if the star is a spectroscopic binary , then it would be necessary to determine the systematic radial velocity . ] and turner et al .",

    "penny ( 1996 ) investigated @xmath168 of o - type stars and found that only a small number of very massive stars show such a large @xmath168 .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to assume that it gained its large @xmath168 during the earlier evolution in a binary system .",
    "furthermore , bss runaway stars should be blue stragglers , i.e. they appear younger , hence bluer , than their parent association ( see hoogerwerf et al .",
    "2001 for other examples ) . in figure  [ bluestraggler ]",
    "we show the colour - magnitude diagram of the potential parent association cyg ob9 with the data adopted from garmany & stencel ( 1992 ) . apparently , the association consists of two major groups of different ages , the younger one being @xmath169 myr old .",
    "if hip 99580 originated from cyg ob9 , it is clearly a blue straggler .    assuming an association age of 4  myr",
    ", the progenitor star of the neutron star must have been 3.4  myr old as it exploded .",
    "thus , its mass was @xmath170 ( tinsley 1980 ; maeder & meynet 1989 ; kodama 1997 ) .",
    "for such large masses , formation of black holes is expected rather than neutron stars ( upper limit @xmath171 , heger et al .",
    "however , due to mass transfer during binary evolution , even more massive stars ( @xmath172 ) may eventually produce neutron stars instead of black holes ( heger et al . 2003 ; belczynski & taam 2008 ) .",
    "also , more massive progenitors may also produce larger speeds of the neutron star ( burrows & young 2000 ) which is consistent with the extraordinary speed of psr  b2224 + 65 .",

    "<S> non - detection of any coherent x - ray pulsation disfavors the magnetospheric origin of the x - rays observed from the position of psr  b2224 + 65  and hence suggest that the interpretation of pulsar wind nebula is more viable . </S>",
