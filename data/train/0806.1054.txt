    "the study of spin glasses is an active and controversial area of statistical physics . in particular , the properties of these systems at zero temperature have been intensively studied in the last years . the problem of finding ground states ( gss ) is a very difficult subject because of the quenched disorder and frustration that are present in most realistic spin glass models .",
    "in fact , it has even been shown that finding the gs of a spin glass in a three - dimensional lattice is an np - complete problem @xcite , which means that this challenge is at least as difficult as the hardest problems of practical interest . as a consequence , many different algorithms @xcite have been proposed to solve it , and to assess the efficiency of these algorithms is thus very important . _ genetic algorithms _",
    "@xcite are considered as the most powerful heuristics to reach the gs of spin glass systems @xcite .",
    "after introduction of the triadic crossover by pl @xcite , different improvements have been made to combine genetic algorithms with , for example , _ cluster - exact approximation _",
    "@xcite and _ renormalization _ @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , algorithms based in monte carlo ( mc ) methods , such as _ simulated annealing _ ( sa ) @xcite , _ multicanonical ensemble _ @xcite and _ parallel tempering _ ( pt ) @xcite , have also been used to find gss of spin glasses .",
    "just as genetic algorithms , they are simple to be implemented . however , mc methods are usually considered less efficient than genetic algorithms , because it is often assumed that the presence of a temperature parameter in the algorithm entails a breaking of the ergodicity that can lead to difficulties in the searching of gss of disordered systems .",
    "recently , pt has been used to find the gs ( see , for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and it has been shown @xcite to be more efficient than other mc based algorithms",
    ". however , the issue of the efficiency of the pt algorithm has been very briefly discussed in the literature . in this work",
    ", we tackle this point in a more systematic way by analyzing how this efficiency depends on the different input parameters of the pt . the system to which the algorithm is applied is the edwards - anderson ( ea ) spin glass model @xcite in two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattices , with both bimodal and gaussian distributions of bonds .",
    "the results show that the performance of the pt technique is comparable to more powerful heuristics developed to find the gs of disordered and frustrated systems .",
    "furthermore , we show that the efficiency depends of certain combinations of the parameters .",
    "in particular , we find a heuristic formula that gives the minimum time ( in unit of time of pt algorithm , see below ) that is necessary to find the gs with a fixed probability and for a given lattice size .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the ea model and three different implementations of the pt algorithm . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we determine the values of the algorithm parameters that are needed to find the gs , with a fixed _ average _ probability , for 2d and 3d ea models with bimodal and gaussian bond distributions , for small lattice sizes . using this , we obtain the gs energy for larger sizes and the thermodynamic limit of this quantity . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we study the efficiency of the pt algorithm to find the gs of _ single _ samples .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "we consider the edwards - anderson spin glass model @xcite , which consists of a set of @xmath0 ising spins @xmath1 placed in a square or cubic lattice of linear dimension @xmath2 , with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 indicates a sum over nearest neighbors .",
    "the coupling constants or bonds , @xmath5 s , are independent random variables drawn from a given distribution with mean zero and variance one . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the ea model with two distributions : the bimodal ( eab ) , and the gaussian ( eag ) . in the eab model ,",
    "the bonds take only two values @xmath6 , with equal probability . for relatively large system sizes , and due to the fact that the bonds are independent variables , only configurations with half of the bonds of each sign are statistically significant . to preserve this feature for small sizes",
    ", we explicitly enforce the constraint @xmath7 for systems with an odd number of bonds , we enforce the constraint @xmath8 for the half of the samples and @xmath9 for the other half . in the eag model ,",
    "the bonds are drawn from a gaussian distribution .",
    "one important difference between these two models is that whereas for the eag the gs of the system is unique ( up to a global symmetry ) , the eab has a highly degenerate gs .    in order to implement a pt algorithm @xcite one needs to make @xmath10 replicas of the system ( ensemble ) to be analyzed , each of which is characterized by a temperature parameter @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the basic idea of this algorithm is to simulate independently a hamiltonian dynamics ( standard mc ) for each replica , and to swap periodically the configurations of two randomly chosen temperatures .",
    "the purpose of this swap is to try to avoid that replicas at low temperatures get stuck in local minima .",
    "thus the highest temperature , @xmath13 , is set in the high - temperature phase where relaxation time is expected to be very short and there exists only one minimum in the free energy space .",
    "the lowest temperature , @xmath14 , is set in the low - temperature phase . within this interval",
    "we choose equally spaced temperatures , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "as mentioned above , pt is based on two procedures that are performed alternately . in the first one ,",
    "a standard mc method is used to independently simulate the dynamics of each replica : in each elementary step , the update of a randomly selected spin of the ensemble is attempted with a probability given by the metropolis rule @xcite . in the second procedure ,",
    "a trial exchange of two configurations @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( corresponding to the @xmath18-th and @xmath19-th replicas ) is attempted , and accepted with probability @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 ( we have taken the boltzmann s constant equal to one without loss of generality ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we restrict the replica exchange to the case @xmath23 . the unit of time in this process or pt step ( pts ) consists of a fixed number of elementary steps of standard mc , followed by other fixed number of trials of replica exchange .",
    "the initial configuration of each replica is usually random but , as discussed below , other choices can endow the algorithm with some interesting features .",
    "the running time of our code , @xmath24 ( in seconds ) , can be approximated by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of ptss , @xmath27 is the number of independent runs and @xmath28 is a constant .",
    "depending on the way we combine the number of elementary steps of standard mc and the number of replica exchanges , we define three different variants of the pt algorithm .",
    "the one that we call a algorithm consists of two stages .",
    "the first is simply a sa routine implemented as follows . starting from a random initial condition ,",
    "@xmath29 mc steps ( mcss ) of standard mc are applied to replica 1 ( each mcs consists of @xmath0 elementary steps of standard mc ) .",
    "next , the same is done successively for each replica , but taking the last configuration of replica @xmath18 as the initial condition of replica @xmath30 .",
    "the final configurations obtained are used to initialize a pt algorithm . in the second stage",
    ", we define that a pts consists of @xmath31 cycles , each cycle being one elementary step of standard mc plus one replica exchange .",
    "after @xmath32 ptss , the algorithm stops and its output is the configuration with the smallest energy among all configurations visited by all replicas in the simulation process .    in the second variant , that we call b , the @xmath10 replicas are initialized with a random configuration and the pts consists of @xmath31 elementary steps of standard mc and only one replica exchange .",
    "this definition is usually chosen to reach equilibrium .",
    "after @xmath33 ptss the algorithm stops and the configuration with lowest energy is stored .",
    "finally , a third variant , called c , consists only of the second stage of variant a , but with the initial configurations randomly chosen .",
    "after @xmath34 ptss ( where the pts is defined as in a algorithm ) , the configuration with minimum energy is stored .    to compare the performance of the three variants proposed",
    ", we run each one of them on the same @xmath35 samples of the 2d eab model ( only one run for sample ) .",
    "we choose the values of parameters @xmath36 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in such a way as to ensure that the running time of the three variants is the same . in our case , we have used @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( this choice depends on the particular implementation of each algorithm ) . in order to check whether the final configuration found by each algorithm is really a gs , we compare with the output of an exact branch - and - cut algorithm run on the same samples @xcite . the quantity we choose to compare the efficiency of the variants a , b and c , is the mean probability of finding the gs , @xmath40 , which we estimate as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an estimation of the probability of reaching the gs for the @xmath43-th sample , @xmath44 . in the last equation ,",
    "@xmath45 is the number of times that gs is found for the @xmath43-th sample in @xmath27 independent runs .",
    "note that in this example we use @xmath46 .",
    "therefore for each sample @xmath47 or 1 .",
    "as it is shown in the appendix a , the error associated to @xmath48 becomes small if many samples are considered and only one run is carried out in each one of them ( it is not necessary to consider many runs for sample , i.e. @xmath49 ) .",

    "[ figure1 ] for different values of @xmath2 and @xmath10 ( see appendix a for a detailed calculation of the error bars ) .",
    "it can be seen that the performance of the three variants is very similar for all values of @xmath26 .",
    "however , a exhaustive analysis shows that for @xmath57 , the performance of b and c algorithms is a little better than the one corresponding to a and this behavior is reinforced upon increasing the lattice size [ see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( a ) ] . on the other hand , by comparing the curves for @xmath54 in figs .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we observe that if @xmath10 is increased , the probability @xmath48 for a and b is the same , while for c it is a little larger .",
    "these examples show that the pt algorithm has a complex dependence with @xmath10 .",
    "the above comparison has been performed also for the other studied cases ( 2d eag , 3d eab and 3d eag models ) and the results are very similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the most important feature is that in the large @xmath48 regime , the performance of a is always worse than the other two , which means that its performance could be used as a lower bound for the b and c cases .",
    "for this reason , in the following we only analyze the performance of a. in addition , we show below that variant a presents very interesting scaling properties . to avoid confusions , we keep @xmath37 in the rest of this paper .",

    "the first issue we address is whether it is better to use a large @xmath26 and one run for each sample , or several runs but with a smaller @xmath26 .",
    "the quantity to be studied for this purpose is @xmath61 , which is the sample average of the probability that a gs is found in at least one of the @xmath27 independent runs in the @xmath43-th sample , @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] ( a ) shows the estimate of this quantity , @xmath58 , as a function of @xmath59 for @xmath46 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we use @xmath35 samples of @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "as expected , the performance improves with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "however , when time is rescaled to @xmath60 in order to compare the performances at the same running time [ see eq .",
    "( [ tsec ] ) ] , independently of the number of runs , the curves approximately collapse [ see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "the example shows that increasing the number of ptss , has approximately the same effect as performing independent runs .",
    "this is due to the fact that , if an appropriate set of parameters are chosen , the fractions of phase space explored by the pt algorithm are similar in both cases . as",
    "this is a recurrent feature in all tested problems , in the rest of this article we take @xmath46 .    in the following ,",
    "we first determine the range of temperatures which is _ globally optimal_. although for each particular problem ( eab or eag in either 2d or 3d ) is possible to determine a different optimal set , for simplicity we choose to fix the range of temperatures .",
    "then , we focus on the number of replicas and the time @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the analysis for small size allows us to predict the optimal values of these parameters for larger lattice sizes .",
    "we begin by discussing the criteria for selecting a suitable range of temperature for each studied system .",
    "as mentioned above , it is important that the highest temperature @xmath13 is set in the high - temperature phase : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the critical temperature .",
    "although for the 2d ea models @xmath68 , below @xmath69 the dynamics becomes slow @xcite and the system has very long relaxation times .",
    "then , it is reasonable to expect that the optimal @xmath13 should be @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "as the algorithm is designed to reach the gs , the lowest temperature @xmath14 should be very low ( but not zero because the metropolis rule is not efficient in that case ) .",
    "as in the previous section , we run the algorithm with several different temperature ranges , on @xmath35 different samples per size ( in the following , this number of samples is used for all 2d calculations ) .",
    "@xmath48 for the eab model is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "we find that , if we fix the lowest temperature at @xmath52 , for the case @xmath53 the highest temperature should not be lower than @xmath71 .",
    "on the other hand , if we choose the highest temperature at @xmath51 , the lowest temperature should not be higher than @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , as seen for @xmath54 , both ranges @xmath51 to @xmath52 and @xmath51 to @xmath72 , give similar results .",
    "the conclusion is that the performance of the algorithm depends only weakly on the range of temperatures chosen under the condition that , a ) the largest temperature is outside the region of slow dynamics ( @xmath70 ) , and b ) the lowest temperature is not too high ( say , @xmath73 ) .",
    "this conclusion is also valid for the eag model . as the bounds mentioned are only approximate , to be sure to meet that condition , in the remaining of this subsection we use @xmath51 and @xmath52 for all the simulations .",
    "we now discuss the dependence of probability @xmath48 on parameters @xmath2 , @xmath10 and @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] ( a ) shows the curves of probability for different lattice sizes and number of replicas . as was to be expected , for fixed values of @xmath26 , @xmath48 increases with @xmath10 .",
    "thus , given that the running time is proportional to @xmath74 [ see eq .",
    "( [ tsec ] ) ] , is reasonable to draw the curves as functions of @xmath75 as in fig .",
