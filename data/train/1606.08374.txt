    "equivalence principle is one of the pillars of einstein s general relativity .",
    "the success of general relativity has therefore led , over the years , to many attempts to search for deviation from this principle .",
    "these attempts have so far been unsuccessful and have provided very stringent upper limits on any possible deviation .",
    "one way to interpret a deviation from equivalence principle is to assume that there exist long - range forces with sub - gravitational strengths and the above mentioned upper limits are then reflections on the strength of these new long - range forces .",
    "a very well known early example of such an interpretation is the work of lee and yang  @xcite who obtained a limit @xmath5 on the strength of the long - range force coupled to baryon number .    in this brief note ,",
    "we point out that if the baryon number violating process of neutron to antineutron oscillation  @xcite is observed , regardless of the level at which it is discovered , it will put an upper limit on the deviation of equivalence principle for neutrons and antineutrons .",
    "if this deviation is attributed to the existence of a @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) local symmetry coupled to baryon number with an associated long - range force , we find very stringent limits on the strength of this long - range force ( denoted by @xmath3 ) .",
    "the limits depend on the range of the force .",
    "the most stringent limit arises in the case when the the range of the force is larger than 100 megaparsec ( mpc ) , and is found to be @xmath8 , which is significantly stronger than that derived by lee and yang .",
    "the basic equation that we use in our discussion is the quantum mechanical evolution of two state system for @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the presence of an external field that distinguishes between neutrons and antineutrons : @xmath11 if we start with an initial beam of neutrons , the probability that an antineutron beam will appear after a transit time of @xmath12 is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "this difference could arise from a magnetic field  @xcite or from nuclear forces , for example . in our discussion here , it will owe its origin to departure from equivalence principle and/or new long range forces that distinguish between neutrons and antineutrons .",
    "for a transit time @xmath12 , the condition for observability of @xmath15 oscillation  @xcite is that @xmath16 gev - sec . for transition time of order of one second , which is what realistic experimental setups can achieve with current technology",
    ", this condition would imply @xmath17 gev as a generous upper limit .",
    "thus , the observation of @xmath15 oscillation will impose a constraint on the strength of the forces that are responsible for causing the mass difference .",
    "this constraint was used recently to obtain a limit on possible violation of lorentz invariance  @xcite .    to obtain the limit on the departure from equivalence principle for neutrons and antineutrons ,",
    "all we have to do is to calculate @xmath18 .",
    "we adopt the following parametrization for this purpose .",
    "let us consider a source of gravitational potential of mass @xmath19 which is at a distance @xmath20 from the neutrons in the experiment searching for @xmath15 oscillation .",
    "assuming that the force causing the departure to be long - range , we can parameterize the departure from equivalence principle for neutrons given by the potential @xmath21 and antineutrons by @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the mass of the neutron )",
    ". then we obtain @xmath24 consideration of different astrophysical sources , which will have different @xmath19 and different @xmath20 , we can get different limits on @xmath25 .",
    "below we summarize the different limits by considering the earth , sun and the superclusters . clearly , the validity of the limits will depend on the range of the forces .",
    "we consider a typical supercluster such as virgo which is at a distance of 16.5 mpc and has a mass of @xmath26 kg .",
    "for this we get @xmath27 gev . using the fact that the corresponding @xmath28 gev ( required if @xmath15 oscillation is observed ) , we get the bound @xmath29 this limit on equivalence principle violation is more stringent than any known at the moment for baryons  @xcite . the results of dicke et .",
    "al . and braginsky et al",
    ". are at the level of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent limit from @xmath31 oscillations seems to be comparable to ours  @xcite , @xmath32 .",
    "if the range @xmath33 of the equivalence principle violating effect is @xmath34 km , then the supercluster limits will not apply ( due to the @xmath35 suppression factor for @xmath36 ) , but there should be a limit by considering the effect of the earth . using the mass of the earth as @xmath37 kg and the radius of the earth as @xmath38",
    "km , we estimate that the earth s effect leads to @xmath39 .",
    "gauging baryon number has been considered for a long time as way to understand the conservation of baryon number in the universe  @xcite . in particular , lee and",
    "yang derived a limit on the strength of the effective baryon number force @xmath3 to be at the level of @xmath40 if we parameterize the resulting potential as @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the baryon numbers of the two objects between which the above potential is effective and @xmath33 is the range of the force .",
    "understanding baryon asymmetry of the universe seems to require as one of its ingredients that baryon number be violated .",
    "this has led to a new class of models where local baryon number symmetry is spontaneously broken  @xcite .",
    "similar situation also happens for @xmath2 violation  @xcite .",
    "typically , in these models , one assumes that the corresponding gauge coupling @xmath43 is is of order @xmath44- so that for spontaneously generated vacuum expectation value @xmath45 , the resulting force is short - range and is not relevant in the discussion of violation of equivalence principle at macroscopic distances . in this section , we will adopt a somewhat different point of view where even though the local baryon number symmetry is broken spontaneously at a few hundred gev to tev scale , the associated gauge coupling is very small .",
    "for example , if the gauge coupling is @xmath46 , the range of the force with @xmath47 tev is larger than the earth radius and will in principle affect the equivalence principle between neutron and antineutron .",
    "note that since in our theory , neutron - antineutron oscillation is allowed to occur at an observable rate , we must have feynman diagrams for @xmath48 processes , which give strengths at the quark level of @xmath49 gev@xmath50 . in beyond the standard model scenarios ,",
    "@xmath15 oscillation arises from the six quark operator @xmath51 and its strength in a typical @xmath2 violating theory  @xcite is given by @xmath52 .",
    "thus we can have observable @xmath15 oscillation by choosing the corresponding yukawa couplings @xmath53 and higgs masses @xmath54 appropriately for tev - scale @xmath55 .",
    "important to note that in the theory of the type described in  @xcite , the @xmath48 diagram does not involve gauge couplings .",
    "thus we can take the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , and make the gauge coupling extremely tiny so that it produces corrections to equivalence principle and then check what would be an upper bound on the gauge coupling in this domain of parameters .    following the procedure above ,",
    "we find that the neutron and antineutron experience equal and opposite long - range forces from an astrophysical object .",
    "considering the effect of the earth , we find that the equivalence principle violating parameter @xmath25 is given by @xmath56 requiring that @xmath15 oscillation be observable in the presence of this effect implies that @xmath57 leading to @xmath58 , which means that the corresponding gauge coupling @xmath59 .",
    "this implies a range @xmath60 cm which exceeds the earth radius .",
    "this is already a much stronger bound than any known to date  @xcite .",
    "this bound becomes even stronger , if we apply the same considerations to the sun .",
    "first note that this would require that the gauge coupling be less than @xmath61 . using the mass of the sun which is @xmath62 kg and earth - sun distance @xmath63 cm .",
    ", we get @xmath64 and hence @xmath65 . for consistency with range requirement",
    ", we must take the symmetry breaking scale @xmath66 gev .",
    "coming to the case of virgo supercluster , where mass and distance are already mentioned , applying similar arguments ( if the range of the force @xmath33 is larger than @xmath67 cm ) , we obtain @xmath4 leading to @xmath68 .",
    "clearly to get this kind of range , we must have the symmetry breaking scale to be less than few ev .",
    "such small vev , to be consistent with current limits on the strengths of @xmath15 oscillation will require making some parameters in the model small .",
    "our goal here is not to explore the naturalness of the theory but rather to pursue the phenomenological implications .",
    "we have summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the constraints from long - range baryonic forces that arise from the earth , the sun and superclusters on the strength of the @xmath1 or @xmath2 gauge interaction @xmath3 .     that would result from observation of @xmath15 oscillation in the presence of a long - range baryonic force . here",
    "@xmath69 cm is the radius of the earth , and @xmath20 is the distance between the experiment and the astrophysical source . ]    we point out that if instead of gauged baryon number , we consider a force coupled to gauged @xmath2 , we will get a slightly weaker bound since typical astrophysical objects will contain hydrogen and helium atoms in comparable numbers ; however the hydrogen atom has zero @xmath2 whereas the helium atom has @xmath70 .",
    "the factor weakening the bound will depend on the relative content of these two atoms in the astrophysical object .",
    "in summary , in this brief note we have pointed out that observation of neutron - antineutron oscillation , in addition to providing a key window into physics beyond the standard model and possibly solving the baryon asymmetry problem , can also provide insight into violation of equivalence principle as well as limits on the strength of long - range baryonic gauge forces .",
    "it is important to point out that to obtain the limits discussed above , one has to carry out the search for and observe free neutron oscillation and not a @xmath48 transition in a nucleus , where such tiny effects are masked by the larger nuclear potential difference affecting the neutron and the antineutron .",
    "it may also be worth noting that , if neutron oscillation inside a nucleus is discovered and no @xmath15 oscillation at the same level is found in free neutron oscillation search , that could be evidence for the existence of violation of equivalence principle and/or existence of baryonic long range forces .",
    "these results should provide additional impetus to carry out the search for free neutron oscillation in the laboratory .",
