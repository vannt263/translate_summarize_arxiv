    "for the last 15 years , single - molecule spectroscopy has mainly focused on luminescence studies of fluorescent molecules and semiconductor nanocrystals @xcite . in the last few years , however , ever increasing interest in the properties and applications of metal nanoparticles ( nanospheres , nanorods , etc . , with sizes between 1 and 100  nm )",
    "has stimulated the development of various optical detection schemes for single metal nanoparticles .",
    "two recent articles have reviewed the general far - field optical methods for the detection of single nanoparticles @xcite , and more particularly the absorption and scattering - based methods @xcite .",
    "an attractive characteristic of gold nanoparticles is their high photostability . unlike dyes or semiconductor nanocrystals",
    ", gold particles do not suffer from photobleaching or photoblinking , which makes them appealing labels for biophysicists @xcite .",
    "another strong motivation is the study of original physical properties of metal nanoparticles , that often differ from those of the bulk metal , and to a large extent can be tuned through the size and shape of the nanoparticle .",
    "this sensitivity to size and shape , however , makes studies of ensembles of nanoparticles particularly vulnerable to distributions in sizes , shapes , crystal defects , etc .. isolating a single particle once and for all eliminates inhomogeneous broadening and any implicit averaging inherent to even the most carefully selected ensembles .",
    "only single - particle experiments permit to study a particle s elastic interaction with its specific close environment @xcite , to correlate optical and structural properties @xcite , or to obtain new insight in their linear and nonlinear optical properties @xcite .",
    "the number of available methods for the detection of single metal nanoparticles has grown rapidly in the last few years @xcite .",
    "of all these methods , interferometric detection of the scattered field seems very promising , mainly because the interferometric signal drops as the third power of the particle size only , whereas the direct scattering signal drops as the sixth power , but also for the possibility to detect the full complex response of a nanoparticle @xcite . in all interferometric experiments , the field scattered by a single metal nanoparticle",
    "is mixed with a reference field , but the methods differ in their choices for the reference and scattered field @xcite . using the incident wave itself as a reference , one basically measures absorption @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the reference wave can be the reflection from the substrate on which the particle has been deposited @xcite , or an external reflection in a michelson interferometer @xcite .",
    "the signal wave can be either directly scattered by the particle , or indirectly scattered from a local inhomogeneity of refractive index , for example induced by heat released by the excited particle into its surroundings , as done in the photothermal method @xcite . in a recent work ,",
    "we have used a common - path interferometer to measure the time - resolved response of single gold nanoparticles down to a 10-nm diameter @xcite .",
    "this sensitive technique allowed us to detect acoustic vibrations of single gold nanoparticles .",
    "the present paper presents a more detailed description of our interferometer and its full characterization .    in our common - path interferometer ,",
    "probe and reference arms are spatially overlapped ( in contrast to , for example , michelson and mach - zehnder interferometers @xcite ) .",
    "the interfering waves are distinguished on the basis of both polarization and time , although any single one of these characteristics would in principle suffice .",
    "temporal separations can be created via a relative delay between laser pulses , as done here , or via a small phase shift between two cw beams , as for example in phase - contrast microscopy @xcite , or by counter propagation in a sagnac ring interferometer , as was recently implemented by hwang et al .",
    "@xcite , for the phase - sensitive detection of very weak absorbers .",
    "the first implementation of a common - path interferometer in combination with pulsed laser sources was published by lagasse et al .",
    "@xcite in an optical switching experiment . in this experiment ,",
    "the probe pulse was delayed by means of polarizing beam splitters and mirrors .",
    "patel et al .",
    "@xcite have built a number of logical elements by using the same technique , but with a birefringent fiber as a delay medium .",
    "hurley and wright @xcite constructed a common - path interferometer based on a sagnac interferometer , also using diversion through polarizing beam splitters to split a pulse into probe and reference .",
    "polarization analysis allowed them to separately detect pump - induced changes in reflectivity and phase . using this method ,",
    "the same group were able to image the progression of pump - induced acoustic waves along a surface @xcite .",
    "we also rely on a polarization - induced delay between a probe pulse and a reference pulse , but we use a birefringent crystal as beamsplitter .",
    "the main advantage of this element is its simplicity and ease of alignment , which leads to a high contrast of the interference pattern .",
    "the delay between the interfering wavetrains in combination with a pump - probe configuration allows us to obtain information on ultrafast properties of the nanoparticles , and the high sensitivity and low noise floor enables experiments on single nanoparticles . by choosing the proper configuration for the polarization optics of our interferometer",
    ", we can separate the detection of amplitude and phase changes induced by a single nanoparticle on the probe pulse , and measure the full complex response of the particle . although we used our interferometer only for gold nanoparticles so far",
    ", the method is in principle applicable to any absorbing and/or dispersing nano - object .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] describes the experimental method .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] provides a model description of the setup based on jones algebra . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss a few experiments that were performed with the setup . in particular , we characterize the setup by comparing data to the mathematical model ( subsection  [ secsub : charac ] ) , we perform a noise analysis showing that our setup is detection - limited but very close to the photon - noise limit ( subsection  [ secsub : noise ] ) , and we provide some examples of measurements on single gold nanoparticles ( subsection  [ secsub : gold ] ) .",
    "schematic drawing of the pump - probe common - path interferometer . a pump pulse and a pair of reference and probe pulses are focused on the sample in a microscope .",
    "the reference - probe pulses arise from a single pulse , split in time ( 10  ps delay ) and polarization by a properly oriented birefringent calcite crystal .",
    "the delay between the pump pulse and the reference - probe pair can be scanned with a delay line .",
    "after the microscope , probe and reference are recombined by a second crystal and their interference monitors pump - induced changes in the optical properties of the sample . a quarter - wave plate ( @xmath0 ) and a polarizer ( pol )",
    "are independently rotated to set the working point of the interferometer .",
    "the other details are described in the text.,width=415 ]    we have designed a polarization - based common - path interferometer that uses two birefringent crystals to split and recombine the probe and reference waves @xcite .",
    "a sketch of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . a laser pulse that is initially polarized at 45 degrees from vertical",
    "is split into two orthogonal polarization directions by the first calcite crystal , whose fast optical axis is vertical .",
    "propagation in the thick ( 15  mm ) birefringent crystal delays one of the polarizations by a time longer than the pulse length .",
    "this effectively creates two pulses , a probe and a reference , which are orthogonally polarized and have a mutual delay of 10  ps .",
    "these pulses interact with the sample ( a glass coverslide on which nanoparticles are spincoated ) in the microscope .    behind the microscope , probe and reference",
    "are recombined by a second crystal , identical to the first one but oriented perpendicularly , its fast axis now being horizontal . with an analyzer assembly of a quarter - wave plate and a polarizer , the recombined waves are projected onto the same polarization state and interfere . independently rotating the quarter - wave plate and",
    "the polarizer allows us to tune the relative contributions of the phase and amplitude of the probe and reference waves .",
    "the interference reports on changes of the sample over the time interval between the probe and the reference pulses . in order to generate and accumulate the signal ,",
    "we induce a change of the sample by means of a separate laser pulse , in a pump - probe configuration .",
    "this pump pulse ( from a synchronous second laser source ) is intensity - modulated by an acoustic - optical modulator ( aom ) and travels over a variable delay line , before it is overlapped by a dichroic beam splitter ( bs ) with the probe beam .",
    "dichroic filters efficiently prevent pump light from reaching the detector . by varying the delay between the pump pulse and the pair of probe and reference pulses , we can measure the ultrafast dynamics of our sample .",
    "let us schematically describe the working of the ideal interferometer with proper settings of the analyzer assembly . if the sample does neither modify the phase nor the amplitude of the probe with respect to those of the reference ( e.g. , if the pump laser is switched off , or if there is no particle in the laser focus ) , the polarization state after recombination is again linear , rotated by 45 degrees from the vertical .",
    "if we now switch on the pump laser while a nanoparticle sits in the common focus of the two laser beams , a small change in the phase and/or amplitude of the probe pulse will modify the polarization state after recombination , giving rise to a slightly elliptical and/or rotated linear polarization .",
    "this changes the transmission through the analyzer assembly .",
    "the change in polarization state is thus translated into a change of intensity at the detector , which we can measure with a lock - in amplifier synchronized with the pump s modulation .    with the quarter - wave plate and the polarizer",
    ", we can tune the fraction of the light that reaches the detector .",
    "if the quarter - wave plate has one of its optical axes parallel to the polarization direction of the incoming light , and if the polarizer is perpendicular to the incoming polarization , the detected intensity is minimized , and the interferometer is in a dark fringe . by rotating the polarizer by 90 degrees , we find a bright fringe , where the detected intensity has a maximum .",
    "besides tuning the fraction of probe light that reaches the detector , we can also use the quarter - wave plate and the polarizer to select a working point where either phase or amplitude modifications of the probe field by the sample can be detected , independently from each other .",
    "if quarter - wave plate and polarizer are rotated in such a way that the amplitudes of the interfering fields are equal , but the phases are different , the interference term will only report on phase changes of the probe  assuming small changes to the fields as it is the case with nanoparticles .",
    "conversely , if the polarizer and the quarter - wave plate are tuned so that the amplitudes are different while the phases are the same , the interferometer only senses amplitude changes of the probe , while phase changes remain unnoticed .",
    "the precise orientations of the polarizer and the quarter - wave plate for which the interferometer is either purely amplitude - sensitive or purely phase - sensitive are calculated in section [ sec : model ] using a model based on jones matrices .",
    "key features of our interferometer are the birefringent crystals for temporal beam splitting and recombination .",
    "although they have the disadvantage that the delay between the probe and the reference pulse is fixed , the alignment becomes much easier , since it is not necessary to align the overlap of the spatial paths of the two interferometer arms .",
    "this considerably improves the visibility of the interferometric fringes .",
    "the crystals are 15-mm thick calcite crystals , cut from the same slab to make them as alike as possible . in order to keep the operation of the interferometer stable , we had to actively stabilize the temperature difference between the two crystals .",
    "no special temperature or mechanical stabilization is needed for the other elements in the beam path as they affect probe and reference in exactly the same manner .",
    "if there is a small difference between the optical path lengths through the crystals , either because of a difference in orientation , temperature , or because of a difference in thickness ( the crystals are specified to be equally thick to within 1  @xmath1 m ) , we will have to allow for a static change in the polarization state of the probe beam after recombination . instead of being linear at 45 degrees ,",
    "the recombined beam can be elliptically polarized with a rotated axis , even when the pump is off . a second static effect that must be taken into account",
    "is a residual difference in the transmissions of the vertical and horizontal polarizations by the microscope .",
    "these two effects change the orientations of the quarter - wave plate and the polarizer at the dark fringe , and the settings of the phase - sensitive and amplitude - sensitive working points .",
    "these experimental imperfections , however , can be included into the model of section [ sec : model ] . by measuring them ,",
    "we can determine and compensate for their influence on the response of the interferometer .",
    "the quality of an interferometer can be characterized by its contrast ratio @xmath2 .",
    "it can be shown that the previous effects , if properly compensated for , do not reduce the contrast .",
    "the contrast ratio is in fact limited by other imperfections of the optical elements , such as depolarization by the microscope objectives .    to generate our probe beam ,",
    "we start with the signal beam of an opo ( ape , berlin ) synchronously pumped by a ti : sapphire laser ( coherent mira 900d ) at a repetition rate of 76  mhz .",
    "the signal beam is frequency - doubled in the opo cavity .",
    "the resulting pulses are nearly fourier - limited and are tunable in wavelength between 520 and 650  nm .",
    "the ti : sapphire laser is operated at 800  nm , and pumped by a cw frequency - doubled nd : yag laser ( coherent verdi v10 , 10  w , 532  nm ) .",
    "the laser system can be aligned to produce pulse lengths either in the picosecond or in the femtosecond range .",
    "the pulse lengths ( full width at half maximum of the autocorrelation function ) of the ti : sapphire laser and the opo are approximately 3  ps and 1.5  ps in the picosecond configuration and 120  fs and 250  fs in the femtosecond configuration . unless otherwise indicated , the measurements in this article were carried out in the femtosecond configuration .    a small part of the ti : sapphire laser beam , split off before entering the opo , serves as the pump in the experiment .",
    "the pump beam travels over a variable delay stage to tune its time of arrival with respect to that of the probe - reference pair ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "the pump beam is combined with the probe beam by a dichroic beam splitter before the first crystal .",
    "the pump polarization is kept parallel to one of the optical axes of the crystal , to ensure that this pulse is not split .",
    "after the objectives , the residual pump light is filtered out by optical bandpass filters .",
    "the home - built microscope consists of two objectives , an oil - immersion objective ( na 1.4 ) for excitation and an air - spaced objective ( na 0.95 ) for collection .",
    "the sample is mounted on a piezo - electric stage and can be scanned with 25-nm precision .",
    "commercial gold nanoparticles ( purchased from british biocell international and sigma - aldrich and used without further treatment ) were dispersed in a 10  mg / ml aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol and the resulting suspension was spin - coated onto a clean glass microscope cover slide .",
    "our detector is an analog silicon apd ( hamamatsu c5331 - 11 ) , which is sensitive for signals modulated at frequencies between 4  khz and 100  mhz .",
    "the smallest optical signal that can be detected against electronic noise , called the noise - equivalent power ( nep ) , is specified between 0.5 and 1  @xmath3 .",
    "the detector signal is fed into a lock - in amplifier ( stanford sr844 ) , whose internal clock drives an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) in the pump path at 400  khz . to prevent overload of the lock - in from the 76  mhz signal of the laser pulses , the signal from the detector",
    "is pre - filtered with a passive 12  mhz low - pass filter .",
    "we model our interferometer by representing each element by a jones matrix . in this way",
    ", we obtain analytical expressions for the intensity at the detector and for the measured signal , as functions of the angles of the quarter - wave plate @xmath4 and of the polarizer @xmath5 ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "we calculate the contribution to our signal of real and imaginary changes in the electric field of the probe for each @xmath5 and @xmath4 and calculate for which combination of angles we can measure the real and imaginary changes separately .    from fig .",
    "[ setup ] , we write all elements of the interferometer as jones matrices . matrix multiplication of the elements with the incoming probe field will yield the electric field and subsequently the intensity at the detector .    the input wave is polarized at @xmath6 degrees , @xmath7 , and is split into a horizontally polarized reference wave , which travels in front , and a vertically polarized probe .",
    "the absorption of the pump pulse by the particle triggers a small time - varying modification @xmath8 in the fields transmitted though the microscope .",
    "the modification @xmath9 is complex - valued , allowing for changes in amplitude and phase of the fields .",
    "the temporal zero is the arrival of the pump pulse at the sample .",
    "reference and probe pulses are orthogonally polarized on each other and delayed by 10  ps .",
    "after recombination , the jones matrix associated with the particle can be written as @xmath10 shape and orientation of the particle are _ a priori _ unknown , and a difference in particle response in the horizontal and vertical direction has to be taken into account , and is here indicated with the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "also , the field of the reference pulse might alter the state of the particle , which changes the particle response to the probe pulse from @xmath8 to @xmath13 . including these two effects",
    "would however lead to more parameters than are solvable , so we assume for now that the particle is symmetric for the horizontal and vertical direction ( so either spherical , or spheroid with the two equal axes in the x - y plane ) , and that we are in a linear - response regime , where the state of the particle is not affected by the field of the reference pulse .",
    "we can now write , instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pump1 ] ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the 10-ps difference in the pump - induced modification of the field .",
    "the approximation is exact for @xmath16 as then @xmath17 , and introduces only small errors for working points of the interferometer close to the dark fringe for all other delays @xmath18 .",
    "as was already mentioned in section [ sec : method ] , it is important to consider a difference in optical path length through both crystals and a difference in transmission of probe and reference through the microscope .",
    "the former effect manifests itself as an additional wave plate in the optical path , while the latter can be modelled with a relative decrease in amplitude of one of the two arms . in the model",
    ", we can combine both effects in one matrix @xmath19 , which adds two additional parameters , @xmath20 for the difference in transmission between the two polarizations ( dichroism ) , and @xmath21 for the optical - path difference : @xmath22 the prefactor is introduced for normalization of the bright fringe intensity . @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be determined experimentally , since a change in either of them causes the dark fringe of the interferometer to deviate from its original position @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , by measuring the actual position of the dark fringe , the two calibration parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be calculated .",
    "the jones matrices of a quarter - wave plate @xmath24 and of a polarizer @xmath25 oriented at an arbitrary angle are found by multiplying the jones matrices for the elements at @xmath26  degree @xcite by rotation matrices : @xmath27 @xmath28 the combined action of the elements in eqs .",

    "[ wps_theory]a we see that the interferometer is in the dark fringe if the quarter - wave plate s fast axis and the polarizer s transmission axis are both oriented at @xmath39 degrees . for a first order approximation , we only consider small deviations from the dark fringe : @xmath40 and @xmath41 . using the small - angle approximation , neglecting all higher - order terms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and disregarding the experimental correction parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21",

    "the mie resonance is a collective oscillation of the free electrons in the particle , and manifests itself as a relatively broad nearly - lorentzian peak in the absorption spectrum .",
    "the position and width of the peak depend on the size and shape of the particle , and on its environment @xcite .",
    "if a particle is excited by a short near - infrared laser pulse , first only free electrons are excited . by electron - electron scattering , a thermalized electron gas is quickly formed , which leads to a short but strong increase in the electron pressure @xcite and a broadening of the plasmon resonance @xcite .",
    "the electrons subsequently cool by electron - phonon coupling on a timescale of about 1  ps , hereby heating the lattice . note that this cooling time depends on the intensity of the excitation @xcite .",
    "this sudden heating of the lattice , together with the short peak of electronic fermi pressure immediately after absorption of the light pulse , launches an acoustic vibration in the lattice @xcite , which manifests itself optically as a periodic red shift of the plasmon resonance @xcite .",
    "the period of this radial breathing mode is given in lamb s theory @xcite as a function of the particle size and of the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities of the metal @xcite .",

    "the delay between the pump and the probe - reference pair was tuned such that the pump and the probe arrive at the sample simultaneously . in this way",
    ", we measure the prompt response of the nanoparticle to the excitation , which gives the highest contrast on the real part of the signal ( absorptive response ) .",
    "the wavelength of the probe was tuned to the plasmon resonance of the particles at 532  nm , again to ensure maximum contrast . with a sampling time of 200",
    "ms per pixel , the particles are detected with a signal - to - noise ratio of roughly 7 .",
    "pump and probe power are limited by the maximum permissible absorption in the particle , which results in a detection limit of 10-nm diameter for gold nanoparticles , for reasonable sampling times shorter than one second per pixel .",
    "we measure the time - dependent response of the nanoparticle to excitation with the pump pulse by varying the delay between the pump pulse and the probe - reference pair of pulses .",
    "[ gold]b shows an example of the response of a single 60-nm gold nanoparticle in the laser focus , detected with a bandwidth of 7.8  hz .",
    "the first part of the trace , which is enlarged in the inset , shows two sharp peaks , that occur when the pump is overlapped with the probe and with the reference respectively .",
    "these peaks stem from the change in optical response due to the hot electron gas . from the rise and decay times of the peaks , the electron - electron scattering and electron - phonon coupling times",
    "can be obtained @xcite .",
    "since these processes take place on timescales faster than a picosecond , the width of the peaks is dominated by the pulse length if the measurement is carried out with picosecond pulses , and information on the electronic decay times of the particle is lost .",
    "however , by using shorter pulses , it is possible to resolve these processes .",
    "this is demonstrated in the inset of fig .",

    "[ fullresp]a , the real and imaginary temporal responses of a single particle are shown together . here",
    ", the different spectral origin ( resonance broadening versus red shift ) of the peaks and of the oscillations becomes apparent , since the two peaks have the same sign in both the amplitude and the phase configuration , while the vibrations are exactly out of phase .",
    "figure  [ fullresp]b shows the real and imaginary temporal response of another particle in the same sample . while the amplitude response of this particle is nearly the same as that of the particle in fig  [ fullresp]a , the phase response is rather different .",

    "[ fullresp]a ( gray ) shows a weaker electronic response , while the overall trace is tilted towards the real axis .",
    "these kind of differences between particles can arise from differences in their spectral responses , themselves due to differences in their size , shape or local environment .",
    "further study is needed to precisely correlate the optical and structural properties of the particles , but there is little doubt that single - particle studies of gold nanoparticles will lead to a better understanding of their properties , and to such applications as elasticity and damping sensors at nanometer scales .",
