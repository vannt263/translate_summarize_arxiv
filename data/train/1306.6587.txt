    "our goal is to investigate and explain the mechanisms of water delivery processes in early planetary systems .",
    "existing dynamic studies simulate the behavior and collision statistics of asteroid families during and after the late heavy bombardment in the early solar system ( e.g. , dvorak et al .",
    "2012 ) and assume a certain water content of the asteroids and complete water delivery to the impact target  usually a ( proto)planet . by investigating the impact process itself we will get a more comprehensive description of water delivery starting at an even earlier point in planetary system evolution by answering the question : under which circumstances does water accumulate in or on bodies resulting from asteroid mergers rather than being lost during the impact ?",
    "the impact process can be simulated via a gravitationally bound rubble - pile model where gravitational reaccumulation of fragments governs the formation of ( porous ) bodies after disruptions ( e.g. , richardson et al .",
    "2000 , 2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "another approach is to directly simulate solid state mechanics during an impact .",
    "we follow the latter approach using smooth(ed ) particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) which is a meshless lagrangian particle method and was developed by lucy ( 1977 ) and gingold and monaghan ( 1977 ) for the simulation of compressible flows in astrophysical context . for a detailed description of sph",
    "see , e.g. , monaghan ( 2005 ) or schfer et al .",
    "the method has been extended to solid state mechanics by libersky & petschek ( 1991 ) . additionally , a model for the simulation of brittle failure has been added by benz & asphaug ( 1994 , henceforth referred to as ba94 , and 1995 ) .",
    "impacts involving agglomerates such as protoplanetesimals and comets have been successfully simulated using porosity models as described in schfer , speith & kley ( 2007 ) , jutzi , benz & michel ( 2008 ) and jutzi et al .",
    "also , self gravity has been incorporated successfully .",
    "this makes sph a promising tool for simulating planetary and asteroid dynamics ( cf .",
    "benavidez et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) . while typical grid codes are very well suited to hydrodynamics in protoplanetary discs they are not so well suited to treat elasto - plastic behavior or brittle failure which are important phenomena in collisions of asteroid - like ( cf .",
    "benz & asphaug 1999 , henceforth referred to as ba99 , michel , benz & richardson 2004 ) or moon - sized objects ( jutzi & asphaug 2011 ) .",
    "being a lagrangian particle method , sph is suitable for complex geometries of solid bodies .",
    "the continuum of the solid body is discretized into mass packages which are commonly referenced as particles .",
    "these particles interact by kernel interpolation and exchange momentum and energy ( cf .",
    "schfer 2005 ) . in this first study",
    "we introduce the basis of our parallel sph code and state numerical tests and a first application .",
    "for modeling the solid bodies we use the tillotson ( 1962 ) equation of state ( eos ) as formulated in melosh ( 1989 ) .",
    "there are two domains depending upon the material energy density @xmath0 . in the case of compressed regions ( @xmath1 ) and",
    "@xmath0 lower than the energy of incipient vaporization @xmath2 the eos reads @xmath3\\rho e + a\\mu + b\\mu^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "is linearly interpolated between the pressures obtained via  ( [ eq : pl ] ) and  ( [ eq : ph ] ) , respectively . for a more detailed description see melosh ( 1989 ) .",
    "the theory of continuum mechanics provides the equations for the conservation of mass , momentum and energy which describe the dynamics of a solid body ( cf .",
    "e.g. , schfer , speith & kley 2007 ) .",
    "the conservation of mass is given by the continuity equation which reads in lagrangian representation ( einstein notation ) @xmath19 the equation for the conservation of momentum is @xmath20 with the stress tensor @xmath21 given by the pressure @xmath6 and the deviatoric stress tensor @xmath22 and @xmath23 denoting the kronecker delta .",
    "energy conservation reads @xmath24 with the strain rate tensor @xmath25 given in  ( [ eq : repsdot ] ) .    in order to describe the dynamics of a solid body we have to specify the time evolution of the deviatoric stress tensor @xmath22 .",
    "we use hooke s law and define the time evolution as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the shear modulus .",
    "the last two terms involve the rotation rate tensor @xmath28 and are rotation terms that are needed since the constitutive equations have to be independent from the material frame of reference .",
    "we apply the commonly used jaumann rate form for the rotation terms .",
    "the rotation rate and strain rate tensors are given by @xmath29 this set of equations describes the dynamics of an elastic solid body . in order to model plastic behavior",
    "we follow the approach by ba94 and use the von mises yield criterion where the deviatoric stress is limited depending on the material yield stress @xmath30 .",
    "we implement this by using a transformed deviatoric stress @xmath31 according to @xmath32\\cdot s^{\\alpha \\beta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as basalt is a brittle material we additionally include a damage model for tensile failure . physically , fracture is related to the failure of atomic or molecular bonds . in analogy to the continuum model for solid bodies a continuum model for fragmentation can be derived ( grady & kipp 1980 ) and has been implemented for these simulations following the ansatz for sph by ba94 .",
    "the distribution @xmath33 of flaws activated by a strain level of @xmath34 among the sph particles is given by a weibull distribution with material parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 according to @xmath37 .",
