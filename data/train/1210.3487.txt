    "although certain distortions of edge states will occur as results of the defect or disorder , the total energy current carried by edge magnons does not change in the whole bulk energy gap .",
    "this indicates that the defect or disorder does not open a gap in the magnon spectrum so that the topology of the chiral magnon edge state is robust . according to the energy ranges ,",
    "the topological magnon states have frequencies within @xmath128\\cup [ 2.13 , 2.49]$ ] thz .",
    "applying different external magnetic fields will not change the main properties of magnons , but shift the corresponding dispersion relations , so that the frequency of topological edge magnons can be tuned flexibly with a wide range .",
    "also , when the inter - layer exchange couplings are considered , they only play the role of effective on - site potentials , which just shift the whole bands and leave the main band structural properties unchanged . in addition , the two - dimensional kagome lattice sheet could be obtained by doping with nonmagnetic atoms as we mentioned before so that the inter - layer exchange couplings are ignorable .",
    "therefore , we expect that one can observe the tmi for the thin film of lu@xmath2v@xmath2o@xmath3 in a wide energy range of magnons .",
    "our findings about the tmi could also be applied for other magnetic crystals , including even antiferromagnetic materials where the existence of magnons is possible .",
    "to realize magnonic devices as well as the predicted tmi , the excitation and detection of magnons is the major challenge .",
    "recent years have witnessed a fast development in experimental techniques such as ferromagnetic resonance @xcite , pulse - inductive microwave magnetometer @xcite , time - resolved scanning kerr microscopy @xcite , optical pump - probe techniques @xcite , as well as brillouin light scattering ( bls ) @xcite which takes a special role since it allows the direct measure of dispersions and band structures .",
    "we could observe the topological edge modes by using these techniques to measure the magnon dispersion relation and could also verify the tmi by detecting the magnon transport in the bulk band gap where magnons could be selectively excited by non - thermal optical pulses @xcite or induced by external spin - polarized current @xcite , so that we can avoid the thermal transport from bulk states but extract the one only from edge channels .",
    "we hope our theoretical predictions about tmi could open a new window into the application of nondissipative magnon transport , especially for the novel magnonic device design , which could also shed light on the information technology based on magnonics , and micro - spintronics .",
    "_ note added : _ recently , we have learned of a submission @xcite thanks to its authors , studying the similar topological chiral magnonic edge mode .",
    "differently , their results are based on a linearized landau - lifshitz equation and account for the dipolar interaction instead of the dm one studied here .",

    "<S> in the ferromagnetic insulator with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , we theoretically predict and numerically verify a topological magnon insulator , where the charge - free magnon is topologically protected for transporting along the edge / surface while it is insulating in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral edge states form a connected loop as a @xmath0- or @xmath1-period mbius strip in the spin - wave vector space , showing the nontrivial topology of magnonic bands . using the nonequilibrium green s function method , </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly demonstrate that the one - way chiral edge transport is indeed topologically protected from defects or disorders . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the topological edge state mainly localizes around edges and leaks into the bulk with oscillatory decay . </S>",
    "<S> although the chiral edge magnons and energy current prefer to travel along one edge from the hot region to the cold one , the anomalous transports are identified in the opposite edge , which reversely flow from the cold region to the hot one . </S>",
    "<S> our findings could be validated within wide energy ranges in various magnonic crystals , such as lu@xmath2v@xmath2o@xmath3 . </S>"
