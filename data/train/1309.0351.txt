    "the horizon of black hole is mostly like a one sided membrane .",
    "it allows the passage of particles and radiation only in one direction .",
    "the black hole horizon has a thermodynamic behavior which was first showed by bekenstein@xcite .",
    "he showed that the area of the event horizon is a direct measure of black hole entropy .",
    "later it was found that the four laws of black hole dynamics have a striking similarity with the four laws of thermodynamics .",
    "this similarity led hawking to propose that black hole could emit particles@xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing is another important area of black hole physics@xcite and a number of studies exist in literature on graviational lensing of black holes and naked singularities@xcite .",
    "bekenstein proposed that the black hole area is quantized and each quantum has a value @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the planck length and the spectrum is equally spaced .",
    "bekenstein s idea is that there is a relation between the area spectrum and the quasinormal modes of black holes@xcite .",

    "lower dimensional charged dilaton black hole has a relation to the lower dimensional string theory so it acts as a tool to study the lower dimensional string theory .",
    "the quasinormal modes of a charged dilaton black hole is studied by fernando@xcite and the area spectrum and thermodynamics are also studied@xcite .",
    "mandal et.al@xcite have obtained a one parameter family of black hole solution to classical dilaton system in two dimensions .",
    "this black hole is called msw black hole in this work . following zeng@xcite et .",
    "al we consider an out going wave which makes periodic motion outside the horizon .",
    "the gravitational system is periodic with respect to the euclidean time with a period given by the inverse of hawking temperature .",
    "the frequency of this out going wave is given by this temperature .",
    "thus the adiabatic invariant term can be found out using surface gravity term . using the method of kunstatter@xcite we have found the entropy and area spectrum of the msw black hole .    in this paper",
    "we study the spectroscopy and thermodynamics of msw black hole .",

    "2 we discuss the thermodynamic aspects of 2 + 1 msw black hole . in sction .",
    "3 we discuss the area spectrum of the black hole . finally , conclusion is given in section .",
    "the metric for msw black hole is given by ( @xmath6 system of units ) @xmath7 where u(r ) is given by@xcite @xmath8 this metric has a zero at ( ie the horizon ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cosmological constant , @xmath11 is a constant factor , @xmath12 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "the black hole mass as a function of @xmath13 is @xmath14    ]    the variation of @xmath12 versus @xmath13 is shown in fig.(1 ) for the different values of @xmath11 and it has a parabolic nature .",
    "the entropy @xmath15 of this @xmath4 dimensional black hole can be obtained as @xmath16 here a is the area , since it is a @xmath4 black hole area implies the circumference of the horizon .",
    "since @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of @xmath12 , we can also express the entropy in terms of black hole mass , as @xmath17    ]    fig.(2 ) is a plot between entropy and mass and it shows a parabolic nature .",
    "the black hole temperature can now be obtained since entropy - mass relation is known .",
    "the general expression for temperature t is @xmath18 the heat capacity is given by the general expression @xmath19 eq.(5 ) can be inverted such that we get @xmath13 in terms of @xmath15 as @xmath20 from eq.(7 ) we can find out the temperature t as @xmath21    ]    fig.(3 ) shows variation of entropy with temperature .",
    "entropy increases rapidly as temperature decreases . the specific heat of black hole can be obtained from eq.(8 ) .",
    "the specific heat is obtained as @xmath22 the specific heat is negative as usual and is twice the entropy of the black hole .",
    "the negative heat capacity indicates that the black hole is thermodynamically unstable . for a large number of black holes",
    "heat capacity is negative showing that black holes are thermodynamically unstesble .",
    "in this section we study the spectra of msw black hole using adiabatic invariant method@xcite .",
    "we find the area spectrum by evaluating the adiabatic invariant integral which varies very slowly compared to the external perturbations .",
    "the adiabatic invariant is quantized using bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule .",
    "the first law of black hole thermodynamics says that @xmath23 we utilize the period of the motion of out going wave , which is shown to be related to the vibrational spectrum of the perturbed black hole , to quantize the area of the msw black hole .",
    "it is well known that the gravity system is periodic with respect to the euclidean time in kruskal coordinate .",
    "particles in this periodic gravitating system also own a period which is inverse of hawking temperature . to find out area spectrum by periodicity method we use the klein - gordon equation given by    @xmath24    we define an action @xmath25 such that @xmath26 is related to the action as @xmath27.\\ ] ] adopting the wave equation ansatz for the scalar field we get the solution of wave equation .",
    "we can also obtain the solution from the hamilton - jacobi equation ,    @xmath28    the action @xmath29 can be decomposed into the functions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 and be written as@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy of the emitted particle measured by an observer at infinity .",
    "@xmath34 in the action can be written in near horizon as@xcite @xmath35 where we consider the out going wave near the horizon . in this case , it is obivious that the wave function @xmath26 outside the horizon can be expressed in the form @xmath36\\psi(r_{+})\\ ] ] and @xmath37 is given by @xmath38,\\ ] ] from eq.(18 ) we can find that @xmath26 is periodic with a period @xmath39 the gravitating system is periodic in kruskal coordinate in euclidean time and the moving particle also gets a periodic motion in this periodic gravity .",
    "the period is related inversely to the hawking temperature as @xmath40 and hence , the hawking temperature is given by @xmath41 in the near horizon @xmath42 as @xmath43 , the change in the mass @xmath44 , becomes @xmath45 the adiabatic invariant@xcite is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the surface gravity and is given by @xmath48 from ( 23 ) @xmath49 and using eq.(26 ) , we can have @xmath50 substituting eqs.(28 ) and ( 24 ) in eq.(25 ) and applying bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , we get @xmath51 and @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 thus we see that the circumference spectrum of msw black hole is discrete and the spacing is equidistant . for this system",
    "the circumference spectrum is indepedent of black hole parameters .",
    "since the entropy of this system is related to circumference spectrum , it is also quantized .",
    "the thermodynamics of 2 + 1 dimensional msw black holes are studied and area spectrum is obtained using adiabatic invariant method .",
    "we have obtained the heat capacity , temperature and mass of msw black hole .",
    "( the different quantities are plotted and studied their behavior ) the mass of the black hole is plotted for various values of horizon radius with different parameter @xmath11 and the graph shows that the horizon radius increases quadratically with mass , the same behavior is shown for mass versus entropy .",
    "the variation of temperature with entropy is also plotted and the graph shows that the entropy increases very rapidly with decreasing temperature .",
    "the heat capacity is found to be negative as is the case for most black holes .",
    "this black hole does not show any phase transition .",
    "the period of euclidean time is found out and adiabatic invariant is calculated . using bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule",
    "we have obtained the area spectrum , here the circumference spectrum and is found to be quantized and equally spaced .",
