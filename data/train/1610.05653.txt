    "the creation of an accurate model to identify acoustic reflector positions from room impulse responses ( rirs ) is important for several different research areas in audio signal processing .",
    "for instance , such a model can provide information about the geometry of the listening environment with respect to a listening position , which can be exploited in audio forensics  @xcite , simultaneous localization and mapping @xcite , and spatial audio @xcite .",
    "in addition , model parameters can be utilized to enhance target signals in fields such as automatic speech recognition @xcite , music transcription @xcite , source separation @xcite , audio tracking @xcite , dereverberation @xcite , and microphone array raking , that captures and combines individual reflections constructively  @xcite . beyond all of these",
    ", an acoustic reflection localizer can be combined with image processing to construct a robust hybrid room geometry model @xcite . in particular ,",
    "acoustic information can aid detection of mirrors or windows , which can not be identified by a visual sensor .    during the last decade ,",
    "several approaches have been presented to localize reflectors from rirs , considering a 2d scenario @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors exploited time of arrival ( toa ) knowledge to localize 2d reflectors , using ellipses .",
    "these ellipses have their major axis equal to a specific reflection path , and foci on the respective microphone and source positions , and the common tangent line corresponds to the 2d reflector under investigation .",
    "recently , 3d models have also been investigated . in @xcite ,",
    "the work in @xcite was extended to 3d spaces .",
    "however , it was not yet a full 3d method , instead combining 2d estimations . a different way to extend the work in @xcite",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where we considered the ellipses generated to be 2d projections of ellipsoids .",
    "this improved the accuracy compared to @xcite , but was also not fully 3d .",
    "the 3d reflector localization methods can approximately be categorized into two groups .",
    "the first one is `` image - source reversion ''  @xcite , where the toa is used to revert to the image source location @xcite , which is subsequently used to determine the reflector position .",
    "the second group contains those methods directly localizing the reflector , without estimating other elements about the room acoustic first  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we refer to this group as `` direct localization '' .",
    "the method in @xcite used the image - source reversion approach to localize reflectors in 3d . in @xcite ,",
    "a large number of loudspeaker orientations were needed . in @xcite ,",
    "a least - squares minimization was utilized to fit `` synthetic '' reflections to recorded rirs .",
    "however , it still required a large number of rirs .",
    "the synthetic reflections were obtained in an anechoic room , with a plastic reflector to simulate a wall . in total , 240 loudspeaker positions were used to collect the recordings , leading to 1440 rirs , considering the six - element microphone array employed . since the number of rirs was deemed not enough to train the model , the rirs were additionally interpolated in space , in order to have more directions of arrival ( doas ) .",
    "the main contribution of @xcite was a novel algorithm to label the reflections from a distributed microphone array , where the reflector order would otherwise be ambiguous if compared among different microphone recordings .",
    "the reflector estimation was performed using image - source reversion , by assuming that the toas were known a priori .    in @xcite , we proposed the image source direction and ranging ( isdar ) method .",
    "however , it was an image source locator only , and it did not have the reflector estimation as its final aim .",
    "it was based on the idea of combining toa and doa to localize the image source .",
    "a similar approach was presented in @xcite .",
    "however , the authors utilized arrays of first - order directional microphones , and the signal recorded was steered towards its doa to estimate the reflection toa . instead , in our isdar , an array of omnidirectional microphones is used , and toas are estimated for each single channel by the dynamic programming projected phase - slope algorithm ( dypsa ) @xcite , and then averaged .",
    "this difference between the methods allows the development of more robust algorithms , for the detection and correction of gross errors , during reflection toa estimation .",
    "one of the first attempts to employ , instead , the direct localization approach was proposed in @xcite . exploiting inverse wave field extrapolation",
    ", the authors mapped reflections from a set of receivers to the related reflecting objects .",
    "this method provided an accurate analysis , and it was even able to identify small reflecting objects lying between the main reflector and the microphone array .",
    "however , the microphone array was assumed to be exactly parallel to the reflector . in @xcite ,",
    "reflector positions were estimated by transforming the rir into the frequency domain . in spite of this ,",
    "only two parallel reflectors were localized , assuming the other boundaries completely absorbent .",
    "the method that can be considered as the first one exploiting direct localization through 3d ellipsoids , was presented in @xcite . despite this",
    ", the peaks were not automatically identified to extract toas from rirs .",
    "in addition , the reflector search was computationally expensive , caused mainly by the optimization of its cost function . in our previous work @xcite , a full 3d method was proposed , exploiting direct reconstruction through ellipsoids .",
    "the reflector search was performed utilizing two variants , either the random sample consensus ( ransac ) algorithm  @xcite , or the combination of the cost function used in @xcite and the hough transform .",
    "methods to localize sources that combine toa with time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) can be found in the literature .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors provided an evaluation over several localization methods , exploiting the toa and tdoa probability density functions .",
    "then , they fused together these two densities , improving robustness .",
    "however , with isdar , we combine toa and doa directly , in spherical coordinates .",
    "we have observed various limitations in the reflector localization literature .",
    "there is not a peak - picking algorithm specifically designed to automatically extract reflection toas from recorded multichannel rirs ; although several algorithms  @xcite have been designed for peak - picking from single channel rirs .",
    "some methods assume specific spatial relationships between the microphone array and reflectors  @xcite .",
    "methods may require thousands of rirs recorded in anechoic rooms  @xcite .",
    "the microphones are often considered to be spatially sparse , introducing the problem of labeling echoes @xcite .",
    "there are no proposed ways to aggregate measurements from multiple loudspeakers to improve localization .",
    "finally , classical image - source reversion methods ( e.g. @xcite ) use toas to localize the image source without considering other information carried by the rirs , limiting their robustness .    to address these issues , the contributions of this work are :    * a multichannel version of dypsa @xcite , i.e. clustered dypsa ( c - dypsa ) , to automatically extract reflection toas from compact microphone array rirs ; * the image - source reversion method isdar - lib , created by the fusion of our isdar ( the image - source locator presented in @xcite ) and loudspeaker - image bisection ( lib ) ( a reflector localization algorithm in @xcite ) ; * two further novel variants of isdar - lib , incorporating information from multiple loudspeakers ; * ellipsoid tangent sample consensus ( etsac ) , a direct localization method ( modified from @xcite , by utilizing the new c - dypsa instead of dypsa ) ; * a comparative evaluation of the state - of - the - art and the proposed methods , using synthetic and measured rirs .",
    "the comprehensive comparison presented here is , to our knowledge , the first one that compares reflector localization performance between image - source reversion and direct localization methods .",
    "the study also informs the level of estimation accuracy expected from a real - world dataset  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : background_theory ] introduces the underlying theory supporting the presented methods , and the pre - processors common to every method evaluated .",
    "the state - of - the - art methods selected for the evaluation are described in section [ sec : state - of - the - art methods ] , and the proposed methods in section [ sec : proposes_methods ] . the numerical analysis and results",
    "are reported in section [ sec : exp_eval ] .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] draws the overall conclusions .",
    "a rir is an acoustic signal , carrying information about the environment in which it was recorded .",
    "it is generally considered as being composed of three components @xcite : the direct sound , revealing the position of the sound source ; the early reflections , conveying a sense of the environmental geometry ; and the late diffuse reverberation , indicating the size of the environment , and average absorption  @xcite . from this classical decomposition , and defining the discrete time variable @xmath0 , the rir from source @xmath1 to sensor @xmath2 can be defined as superimposition of dirac deltas , delayed by @xmath3 samples , with @xmath4 enumerating the reflections  @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the direct sound , @xmath7 the early reflections , and @xmath8 is the late reverberation modeled as exponentially decaying gaussian noise ; @xmath9 is the @xmath4-th peak corresponding to the last reflection before the mixing time .",
    "the most prominent early reflections typically have a sizable specular component .",
    "therefore , one way to localize reflectors is to benefit from the notion of image sources @xcite . denoting @xmath10 as a vector containing the three cartesian coordinates of the sound source and @xmath11 as a vector containing the first reflector ( @xmath12 ) plane coefficients ,",
    "the corresponding image source @xmath13 is the virtual sound source , constructed as the point @xmath10 mirrored with respect to @xmath11",
    ".    .3d method categorization . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to evaluate the etsac performance directly together with @xcite and @xcite , images were calculated from the estimated plane .",
    "in particular , having all the @xmath14 from running etsac , where @xmath15 is the index of the loudspeaker combination , and the @xmath16 loudspeaker positions @xmath17 , the @xmath16 images @xmath18 were localized .",
    "then , exploiting equation  ( [ eq : mid - point ] ) , the midpoints @xmath19 were obtained .",
    "this method is named mirrored etsac .",
    "figure [ fig : visualization_ebrief_like ] shows circles to mark reflection positions in the plane of the estimated reflector with a shoebox outline of each room .",
    "the image localization errors for mirrored etsac , calculated as before by equation  ( [ eq : error_images ] ) , are reported in the last row of table [ tab : image_localization_etsac ] .",
    "the fine error results indicate that the images generated via the etsac - estimated reflector are consistently more accurate than those from the other methods in audiobooth , vislab and studio1 . in vml",
    ", we observe an increment on the level of fine errors since all the methods find this dataset challenging , as seen in the high levels of gross error .",
    "the key result here therefore is the reduction in gross error rate , from over two thirds down to one half using mirrored etsac .",
    "the gross error reduction by mirrored etsac however comes with sacrifice in its fine error score in vml .",
    "nevertheless , the w - avg shows an overall improvement in the performance .",
    "in addition , comparing only those cases that both isdar - lib and mirrored etsac successfully resolved ( i.e. , discarding any cases of gross error ) , the fine error average are 248@xmath205 and 160@xmath207 respectively , which confirms the superior performance of mirrored etsac . in spite of this , with a gross error rate of 12.5% across all four datasets , we observe an average error of 22 cm in the image source location , whereas it is 5 cm in the reflector location .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the scale of these localization errors is comparable to the limits of human perception @xcite .      to assess the computational complexity of image - source reversion and direct localization methods , a rough calculation of the number of linear and non - linear operations",
    "is reported , considering isdar - lib and etsac .",
    "isdar - lib needs a total of 21 linear operations and 8 non - linear ones to find the reflector . on the other hand",
    ", etsac employs 83 linear and 9 non - linear operations to generate each of the @xmath21 ellipsoids , plus 93 linear and 2 non - linear operations for each @xmath22-th plane generated .",
    "in addition , etsac uses , in the reflector search step , a sampling method based on ransac , which tests @xmath23 planes before finding the best one . on the other hand , isdar - lib , once it localizes the image source , it estimates the position of the related plane once . as a result ,",
    "isdar - lib had a run time approximately 200 times faster than etsac ( i.e. the run times are 0.011s for isdar - lib , and 2.123s for etsac ) .",
    "we presented four novel reflector localization methods : three image - source reversion ( isdar - lib , mean - isdar - lib , median - isdar - lib ) , and a direct localization ( etsac ) . to automatically extract toas from multichannel rirs ,",
    "the novel c - dypsa was also introduced .",
    "the proposed methods were compared with baselines , to discover the best approach for reflector localization given compact microphone array rirs .",
    "simulations of recording conditions , with background noise and microphone positions displacements , were used to test the methods by varying the room size , absorption coefficient and dnr .",
    "results showed that etsac performed better than the other methods tested , in every condition .",
    "all methods were affected by gross errors for small environments , fine errors increased with the increasing in absorption coefficient . furthermore , mean - isdar - lib and etsac were robust to low dnr conditions",
    ". experiments with recorded rirs were divided into three main tasks .",
    "firstly , the image localization algorithms proposed in @xcite and @xcite were compared to isdar .",
    "results show that the novel isdar provided the best performance . the second part of the experiments compared isdar - lib , with mean - isdar - lib , median - isdar - lib , which are novel image - source reversion methods exploiting multiple loudspeakers , together with our direct localization method etsac .",
    "results show that etsac localized the reflector with an average 5 cm rmse , i.e. , 42% lower than the best alternative method , here tested . in the last experiment , the reflectors estimated through etsac were converted into their corresponding image sources , and compared with the image locators in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this showed the percentage of gross errors dropping drastically from 38% ( multilateration @xcite ) to 13% ( etsac ) . to sum up",
    ", these experiments showed that the direct localization gave better reflector localization accuracy than image - source reversion across the evaluated rir datasets .",
    "results also showed that images then located by mirroring sources in the reflector also benefited from the improved reflector estimation .",
    "however as isdar - lib ran 200 times faster than etsac , it has an advantage for fast processing applications , as well as single - source measurements , which may be useful in tracking .",
    "further improvements may in the future be found by exploring alternative microphone array arrangements over a large set of rooms , optimal beamformer designs for doa estimation , and robust methods for multiple loudspeaker isdar - lib post - processing .",
    "the authors would like to thank dr .",
    "sakari  tervo of aalto university , who has kindly shared the lib code .",
    "we wish also to thank the associate editor and the anonymous reviewers for their contributions to improving this paper .",
