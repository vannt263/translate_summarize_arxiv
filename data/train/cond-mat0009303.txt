    "recently , there has been a growing experimental and theoretical activity directed towards an increased functionality of present day electronic devices .",
    "previously , electrical potentials were used to modify the current , while more recently one became interested in the effects of magnetic field profiles , modulated or not , on the motion of electrons in semiconductor structures .",
    "the latter is usually a heterostructure which contains a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "inhomogeneous magnetic field profiles in the 2deg are created by depositing superconducting or ferromagnetic materials on top of the heterostructure which is then patterned in the desired shape using modern nanolithography.@xcite    these hybrid systems are important from a theoretical and technological point of view , since they open the door to new physics which might result in e.g. new magneto - electronic devices.@xcite an example of such a new device is the hybrid hall effect device @xcite in which the magnetic material provides a local magnetic field which influences locally the electron transport in the underlying 2deg .",
    "the 2deg then acts as a detector@xcite measuring the magnetic state of the magnetic material .",

    "@xcite    when an ( 1d ) inhomogeneous magnetic field is applied across a quasi 1d wire , these magnetic edge states are confined electrically due to the wire confinement potential and they mix with the ordinary edge states.@xcite such a situation was recently realized by nogaret _",
    "et al._,@xcite where the inhomogeneous magnetic profile was arising from a perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic stripe grown on top of the 2deg .",
    "they measured the magneto- and hall resistance as function of a background magnetic field , and observed a sharp resistance resonance effect , which they attributed to the formation and subsequent killing of magnetic edge states .    in the present work",

    "the electron transport in the 2deg is only influenced by the perpendicular component of the magnetic stray field . in absence of any background magnetic field the ferromagnetic stripe is magnetized along the easy axis , i.e. the @xmath8-direction , and the fringe field is situated outside the quasi 1d wire , i.e. in reservoir 1 and 2 .",

    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2 ] . for @xmath51 the magnetic stripe is not magnetized and the spectrum consists only of the potential confined levels .",
    "one single parabola ( and its duplicates due to confinement ) centered around @xmath79 is found which splits into two and its center shifts towards higher @xmath73-values . below the intersection of the",
    "two shifted parabolas landau states are formed .",
    "notice that some levels intersect the fermi energy twice as much as before .",
    "these landau states separate further away from each other for increasing magnetic field . for @xmath80",
    "the spectra are identical to the ones of ( a ) .",
    "the number of conducting channels is given by the number of energy levels intersecting the fermi energy @xmath37 , and hence the current is @xmath81 with @xmath82 , since in absence of any collisions @xmath83 .    nevertheless , the mean free path measured by nogaret _",
    "et al . _ is smaller than the length of the wire @xmath84 and also smaller than the distance between the probes .",
    "thus , scattering will play an important role in electron transport and consequently @xmath85 will be less than 1 . in order to account for this , we will estimate the transmission coefficient for every channel using classical arguments .",
    "since we consider the voltage probes as weakly coupled , they result in a very weak perturbation of the electron - current path , and scattering due to the voltage probes will be neglected .",
    "the only scattering we consider is due to collisions with impurities and other imperfections in the 1d - channel .",
    "the rate at which these collisions occur depends classically on the velocity in the @xmath8-direction , the length of the wire and the scattering time .",
    "the lower the velocity in the @xmath8-direction , the longer it takes to overcome the distance between probe 1 and probe 2 , and the more probable it will be to experience a scattering event . because of this we consider the transmission probability of every channel to be proportional to its velocity @xmath86 and the scattering time @xmath87 , and inversely proportional to the length @xmath88 of the wire , i.e. , @xmath89 so finally , we arrive at the two terminal resistance @xmath90 where @xmath15 runs over all the @xmath37 electron states with positive velocity ( or negative velocity ) at the fermi energy @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is a function of @xmath88 and @xmath87 .    first we will discuss the change of the two - terminal resistance @xmath34 with respect to the situation in absence of the ferromagnetic stripe @xmath93 , which we will call the _ induced _ resistance @xmath94 .",
    "this property was also calculated and discussed by nogaret _",
    "et al._,@xcite and is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : induced - res ] as function of the applied magnetic field @xmath45 for the approach of ref .",
    "( dashed curve ) and ours ( dotted and solid curves ) .",
    "the zero temperature result is shown in the inset .",
    "we notice that at zero temperature , many discontinuous jumps are present .",
    "as we will see further on , their position is very sensitive to the fermi - energy and they disappear at 4.2 k. the energy distribution function @xmath95 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] is not a stepfunction for nonzero temperature and consequently also electrons with energy different from @xmath91 will contribute to the conductivity .",
    "this will smoothen out these oscillations , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : induced - res ] . also the broadening of the energy levels due to",
    "e.g. potential fluctuations will have such a smoothening effect on the resistance curves .",
    "hence , we will only show these smooth curves in the next figures .",
    "the curves ( a ) and ( b ) differ only for @xmath96 . in case ( a )",
    "the resistance for @xmath51 is larger than in the absence of the magnetic stripe . increasing the background magnetic field results in a slight overall increase of the induced resistance . at @xmath97",
    "the induced resistance reaches its maximum , then it decreases rapidly .",
    "the induced resistance in case ( b ) starts at 1 for @xmath51 , increases more rapidly and attains its maximum at a slightly higher @xmath45-value , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "then it decreases rapidly up to @xmath99 .",
    "we again notice oscillations at zero temperature ( see inset ) , but fewer than for case ( a ) . for larger @xmath45-values",
    "the oscillations disappear and the scaled resistance increases ultimately to one .",
    "nogaret _ _ et al.__@xcite obtained theoretically a somewhat similar behaviour , as is indicated by the dashed curve , except for the peak which was situated at a slightly higher value @xmath100 .",
    "they made the assumption that the stripe was already fully magnetized at @xmath51 like in our case ( a ) .",
    "moreover they considered the magnetoresistance for a homogeneous magnetic field profile with magnetic field strength @xmath45 , and considered the effect of the magnetic stripe profile by adding classical trajectories of states which arise due to the presence of the stripe . in order to simplify the problem , they only considered states which do not reach ( classically ) the edge of the sample .",
    "they attributed the initial positive magnetoresistance to _ snake orbits _",
    "( see situation ",
    "@xmath101 \" in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra1](a ) ) which are killed with increasing magnetic field and therefore no longer contribute to the conductivity for larger fields . at @xmath100",
    "all snake orbits have vanished and it is due to this , they inferred , that the resistance reaches its maximum .",
    "however if the magnetic field is larger than @xmath102 , the magnetic field has the same sign over the whole sample but has different strength under the stripe and away from it , and a new type of magnetic edge states , so called _ cycloidlike _ states ( see the states indicated by  @xmath103 \" in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra1](b ) ) , arises , which again enhances conductivity and thus lowers the resistance .",
    "the fact that the influence of the latter orbits vanishes for larger @xmath45-values is due to the decrease of the velocity of these states with decreasing relative difference between the two neighboring magnetic fields .    in case ( a ) ,",
    "when the saturation magnetization is already attained at @xmath51 , we can not attribute the existence of the ( small ) peak to the creation or annihilation of a certain classical state .",
    "[ fig : spectra1 ] shows the energy spectrum and the corresponding classical states at the fermi - energy @xmath104 for ( a ) @xmath51 , ( b ) @xmath105 and ( c ) @xmath106 . from this figure",
    "we see that the enhancement of the resistance is a pure quantum mechanical effect and involves many different types of states with different velocities .",
    "therefore an explanation based on the appearance or disappearance of only snake orbits as done by nogaret _",
    "et al . _ is not possible , at least for small @xmath45 .",
    "the discontinuous behaviour for small @xmath45 ( see the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : induced - res ] ) is due to edge states at the fermi - level whose energy moves through the fermi level and then no longer contribute to the conduction .",
    "they have nonzero velocity and hence this is also reflected in the resistance . for larger @xmath107",
    "the curve coincides with the one of case ( b ) .    in case ( b ) , the initial magnetoresistance can be understood more easily . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the stripe is not yet magnetized and thus there is no effect of the magnetic stripe .",
    "[ fig : spectra2](a ) shows subbands formed due to the quasi 1d confinement ( @xmath108 subbands contribute to the conduction ) .",
    "already for a small applied magnetic field , a relative large magnetic field is induced in the wire due to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic stripe . whereas , for @xmath51 the only confinement was due to the edges of the sample , the magnetic field tends to localize electrons into cyclotron orbits and thus forces them in landau levels , which separate further in energy with increasing magnetic field . as a consequence",
    "less channels will intersect the fermi - level and consequently less channels contribute to electron transport and the resistance increases .",
    "but there is a competing effect due to the presence of the magnetic stripe which tends to lower the induced resistance : new edge states arise ( see the states indicated by  @xmath103 \" and  @xmath109 \" in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectra1 ] and [ fig : spectra2 ] ) which travel in the opposite direction of the normal edge states . in terms of energy spectra , this effect is contained in subbands which contribute twice to the conductivity , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectra1](b , c ) .",
    "it overcomes the previous one at @xmath98 , and the induced resistance decreases .",
    "this effect contributes even for @xmath110 , when the magnetic field has the same sign in the whole wire , and the previously mentioned cycloidlike orbits appear . for increasing magnetic field their influence decreases , although their number with respect to normal edge states increases .",
    "this is due to their velocity , which decreases for increasing @xmath45 for reasons given by nogaret _",
    "et al . _    in the following sections , we will try to reproduce the experimental results obtained by nogaret _ et al .",
    "_ first we will concentrate on the hall resistance , before we focus on the magnetoresistance .",
    "in order to calculate the magneto- and hall resistance we will further simplify the problem , by making the assumption of symmetrical probes . in case of the hall resistance , the two voltage probes , i.e. probe 3 and 4 , are in front of each other as is clear from fig .  [",
    "fig : four - terminal ] , and due to this symmetry the transmission probabilities can be written as @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the hall resistance then attains a very simple form @xmath113 as was already derived in ref .  .",
    "note that there is additionally one parameter @xmath92 and one function @xmath114 which describe the behaviour of the hall resistance . in the absence of any magnetic field @xmath115 , and",
    "consequently the hall resistance reduces to zero .",
    "as the cyclotron radius decreases , electrons will be localized closer to the edge ( in edge states ) and consequently the probability for an electron _ bouncing _ on one edge to be transmitted in a probe on the other side of the wire decreases drastically , i.e. exponentially , with increasing magnetic field , as can be inferred from ref .. consequently @xmath114 will decrease rapidly and ultimately for already a small applied magnetic field the geometrical form factor @xmath116 will be 1 in which case the hall resistance equals the two - terminal resistance @xmath34 .    in order to obtain qualitative agreement with experiment , we follow ref .   and",
    "take the following functional form for @xmath117 $ ] with @xmath45 expressed in tesla . if we take @xmath118 as the functional form of the hall resistance in absence of the magnetic stripe , which we obtained from a linear fit of the experimental result by nogaret",
    "_ et al . _ , we obtain the induced hall resistance @xmath119 as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : induced - hall - res ] for case ( a ) and ( b ) ( dotted and solid curves , respectively ) which is compared with the experimental result ( dashed curve ) .",
    "we notice that the induced hall resistance for @xmath51 approaches 0.5 in both cases ( a ) and ( b ) , and increases rapidly until @xmath120 in case ( a ) and @xmath98 for ( b ) .",

    "almost coincides with the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : induced - res ] , which is due to the exponential form of @xmath114 .    notice that for case ( b ) the peak is very close to the experimental position and the qualitative behaviour of the hall resistance is reproduced , the experimental curve differs quantitatively with the theoretical one only for @xmath122 .",
    "our hall resistance in this magnetic field range is smaller than measured experimentally . from this comparison",
    "it seems that the cycloidlike electron trajectories do not contribute much for large applied magnetic field @xmath45 .",
    "this might be due to a large concentration of scatterers underneath the magnetic stripe edge , which might arise from the fabrication process of the sample .",
    "this would not only result in an increase of the resistance , but would especially hamper / kill the cycloidlike states propagating underneath it .    due to the fact that the hall resistance for large @xmath45 equals the two terminal resistance , it is possible to estimate @xmath92 by comparison of the theoretical curve with the experimental one . in order to obtain reasonable agreement with the experimental curve",
