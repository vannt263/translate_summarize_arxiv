    "there is strong evidence that cluster environments affect the morphology of galaxies @xcite .",
    "some of the processes that have been identified include , ram pressure , starvation , mergers , halo truncation , and galaxy harassment .",
    "while , these mechanisms could act simultaneously , we have neither identified which is the dominant one , nor its time scale .",
    "we are exploring the morphology and distribution of cluster galaxies searching for clues that can help us to identify the process that affects galaxy morphology more strongly . in this work ,",
    "we have been able to separate e / s0/s galaxies comparing with dressler morphologies @xcite on the @xmath0 vs b / t plane .",
    "we have fitted bulge and disk components for 635 galaxies in 18 abell clusters .",
    "we have a trend between the magnitude of the bulge and the b / t .",
    "in addition we identified 12 cluster radio galaxies in our sample . in this work",
    "we have assumed @xmath5 = 73 km / s / mpc , @xmath6 & @xmath7 .",
    "we have used the locos database ( low - redshift cluster optical survey ) @xcite .",
    "the galaxy clusters were observed at kpno with the 0.9 meters telescope in kron - cousins @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands .",
    "the images cover a range of 23.2 x 23.2 minutes and have a scale plate of 0.69/pix @xcite . for this study",
    "we have used @xmath2 band images .",
    "our sample overlaps with 8 clusters where galaxy types have been provided by dressler @xcite .",
    "memberships have been determined for 11 clusters using spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "our final sample contains @xmath10 clusters with redshifts between @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we have cross - matched our sample with faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) data base , and we have found 12 radio galaxies ( rs ) .",
    "we have used galfit package @xcite in conjunction with dgcg ( driver for galfit on cluster galaxies ) @xcite to fit the surface brightness models .",
    "dgcg is a script that allows galfit to work automatically , that is , dgcg deblends or mask undesirable regions on the image , and drives galfit to work on uncontaminated images .",
    "we have modeled the surface brightness distribution of galaxies using a two - component model based on a bulge component and a disk component .",
    "we assume that the bulges are srsics @xcite and the disks are exponential .",
    "the srsic function have the following form : @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are effective radius , surface brightness at effective radius and srsic index respectively ; the @xmath15 parameter forces half to the light to be contained within @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath16 , we have exponential function . and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the total flux of bulge and disk respectively .",
    "using dgcg on locos data base , we have fitted 635 galaxies in @xmath2 band . from this sample ,",
    "172 galaxies are in the classification catalog of dressler @xcite .     vs. b / t plane for 172 galaxies in dressler s catalog .",
    "solid lines separate different morphological types .",
    "the following types are indicated , ellipticals galaxies ( @xmath20 ) , e / s0 galaxies ( @xmath21 ) , s0 galaxies ( @xmath22 ) , s0/s galaxies ( @xmath23 ) , spirals galaxies ( @xmath24 ) and radio galaxies ( ) . ]    . ]",
    "figure [ classellip ] shows @xmath0 vs. b / t plane , where dressler morphologies are shown . we have defined the following regions : elliptical galaxies occupy the region @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 ; s0s are in the region @xmath25 and @xmath27 ; and spirals are in the region @xmath28 and @xmath29 . adopting this scheme , we have classified the rest of the galaxies .",
    "we have recovered the kormendy relation @xcite .",
    "our fitting gives @xmath30 , which is similar to the result by @xcite .",
    "figure [ btbmagrad2 ] shows bulge magnitude vs. b / t for all the galaxies . there is a tendency that brighter bulges are found in galaxies with larger b / t .",
    "since the mean of the total magnitudes of ellipticals , s0s and spirals are @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 mag , respectively ; and the mean of bulge magnitudes of ellipticals , s0s and spirals are @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "we suggest that s0 galaxies are the result of an internal process that transforms the bulges and the disks of spirals galaxies .",
    "we have determined the morphology for the 12 radio sources ( @xmath37 ) in our sample . of these , 3 are cds , 7 are ellipticals and 2 are s0 galaxies .",
    "their bulge magnitudes are between @xmath38 mag and @xmath39 mag .",
    "following ferrarese & merritt relation @xcite , we found that for a @xmath38 mag bulge the associated black hole mass is @xmath40 ; while , cd galaxies have the most massive black holes reaching up to @xmath41",
    "in this work we have propose a new approach to quantify galaxy morphology for cluster galaxies .",
    "since the effects of crowding are important in cluster environment we have developed dgcg , an script that masks and deblends galaxies , allowing galfit to work on uncontaminated regions .",
    "we propose that s0 galaxies are not formed by ram pressure alone .",
    "we have found that radio galaxies in clusters have the most massive black holes ."
