    "a _ map projection _ is a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of positions on the surface of the earth to a flat sheet of paper , a map .",
    "more precisely , a map projection requires a transformation from a set of two independent coordinates on the model of the earth ( the latitude @xmath0 and longitude @xmath1 ) to a set of two independent coordinates on the map ( the cartesian coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , i.e. , a transformation matrix @xmath4 such that @xmath5=t\\left [ \\begin { array}{c } \\phi \\\\ \\lambda\\end { array } \\right]\\!.\\ ] ] however , since we are dealing with partial derivative and fundamental quantities ( to be defined later ) , it is impossible to find such a transformation explicitly .",
    "there are a number of techniques for map projection , yet in all of them distortion occurs in length , angle , shape , area or in a combination of these .",
    "carl friedrich gauss showed that a sphere s surface can not be represented on a map without distortion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a _ terrestrial globe _ is a three dimensional scale model of the earth that does not distort the real shape and the real size of large futures of the earth .",
    "the term _ globe _ is used for those objects that are approximately spherical .",
    "the equation for spherical model of the earth with radius @xmath6 is @xmath7    an oblate _ ellipsoid _ or _ spheroid _ is a quadratic surface obtained by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis ( the axis that passes through the north pole and the south pole ) .",
    "the shape of the earth is appeared to be an oblate ellipsoid ( mean earth ellipsoid ) , and the geodetic latitudes and longitudes of positions on the surface of the earth coming from satellite observations are on this ellipsoid .",
    "the equation for spheroidal model of the earth is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the semimajor axis , and @xmath10 is the semiminor axis of the spheroid of revolution .",
    "the spherical representation of the earth ( terrestrial globe ) must be modified to maintain accurate representation of either shape or size of the spheroidal representation of the earth .",
    "we discuss about these two representations in section [ section4 ] .",
    "there are three major types of map projections :    * 1",
    ". equal - area projections . * these projections",
    "preserve the area ( the size ) between the map and the model of the earth .",
    "in other words , every section of the map keeps a constant ratio to the area of the earth which it represents .",
    "some of these projections are albers with one or two standard parallels ( the conical equal - area ) , the bonne , the azimuthal and lambert cylindrical equal - area which are best applied to a local area of the earth , and some of them are world maps such as the sinusoidal , the mollweide , the parabolic , the hammer - aitoff , the boggs eumorphic , and eckert iv .    * 2 . conformal projections . *",
    "these projections maintain the shape of an area during transformation from the earth to a map .",
    "these projections include the mercator , the lambert conformal with one standard parallel , and the stereographic .",
    "these projections are only applicable to limited areas on the model of the earth for any one map .",
    "since there is no practical use for conformal world maps , conformal world maps are not considered .",
    "* 3 . conventional projections . *",
    "these projections are neither equal - area nor conformal , and they are designed based on some particular applications .",
    "some examples are the simple conic , the gnomonic , the azimuthal equidistant , the miller , the polyconic , the robinson , and the plate carree projections .    in this paper , we only show the derivation of plotting equations on a map for the mercator and lambert cylindrical equal - area for a spherical model of the earth ( section [ section2 ] ) , the albers with one standard parallel and the azimuthal for a spherical model of the earth and the lambert conformal with one standard parallel for a spheroidal model of the earth ( section [ section5 ] ) , the sinusoidal ( section [ section6 ] ) , the simple conic and the plate carree projections ( section [ section7 ] ) . the methods to obtain other projections are similar to these projections , and the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "suppose that a terrestrial glob is covered with infinitesimal circles . in order to show distortions in a map projection",
    ", one may look at the projection of these circles in a map which are ellipses whose axes are the two principal directions along which scale is maximal and minimal at that point on the map . this mathematical contrivance is called _ tissot s",
    "indicatrix_.    usually tissot s indicatrices are placed across a map along the intersections of meridians and parallels to the equator , and they provide a good tool to calculate the magnitude of distortions at those points ( the intersections ) .    in an equal - area projection , tissot s indicatrices change shape ( from circles to ellipses ) , whereas their areas remain the same . in conformal projection , however , the shape of circles preserves , and the area varies . in conventional projection , both shape and size of these circles change . in this paper , we portrayed the mercator , the lambert cylindrical equal - area , the sinusoidal and the plate carree maps with tissot s indicatrices .    in section [ section8 ] , the equations for distortions of length , area and angle are derived , and distortion in length for the albers projection and in length and area for the mercator projection are calculated , @xcite .",
    "in this section , by an elementary method , we show the cylindrical method that mercator used to map from a spherical model of the earth to a flat sheet of paper . also , we give the plotting equations for the lambert cylindrical equal - area projection . then",
    ", in section [ section3 ] , we obtain the gaussian fundamental quantities , and show a routine mathematical way to find plotting equations for different map projections . this section is based mostly on @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be the globe , and @xmath12 be a circular cylinder tangent to @xmath11 along the equator , see fig .",
    "[ cylinder ] .",
    "projecting @xmath11 along the rays passing through the center of @xmath11 onto @xmath12 , and unrolling the cylinder onto a vertical strip in a plane is called _ central cylindrical projection_. clearly , each meridian on the sphere is mapped to a vertical line to the equator , and each parallel of the equator is mapped onto a circle on the cylinder and so a line parallel to the equator on the map .",
    "all methods discussed in this section and other sections are about central projection , i.e. , rays pass through the center of the earth to a cone or cylinder .",
    "methods for those projections that are not central are similar to central projections ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be the width of the map .",
    "the scale of the map along the equator is @xmath14 that is the ratio of size of objects drawn in the map to actual size of the object it represents .",
    "the scale of the map usually is shown by three methods : arithmetical ( e.g. 1:6,000,000 ) , verbal ( e.g. 100 miles to the inch ) or geometrical .    at latitude @xmath0 ,",
    "the parallel to the equator is a circle with circumference @xmath15 , so the scale of the map at this latitude is @xmath16 where the subscript @xmath17 stands for horizontal .",
    "assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in radians , and the origin in the cartesian coordinate system corresponds to the intersection of the greenwich meridian ( @xmath18 ) and the equator ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "then every cylindrical projection is given explicitly by the following equations @xmath20 for instance , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ cylinder ] that a central cylindrical projection is given by @xmath21 where for a map of width @xmath13 , a globe of radius @xmath22 is chosen .    in a globe ,",
    "the arc length between latitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath23 ( in radians ) along a meridian is @xmath24 and the image on the map has the length @xmath25 .",
    "so the overall scale factor of this arc along the meridian when @xmath23 gets closer and closer to @xmath0 is @xmath26 where the subscript @xmath27 stands for vertical .",
    "the goal of mercator was to equate the horizontal scale with vertical scale at latitude @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "thus , from eqs . and , @xmath29 mercator was not be able to solve equation [ conmer ] precisely because logarithms were not invented ! but now , we know that the following is the solution to eq .",

    "[ mer11 ] shows the mercator projection with tissot s indicatrices that do not change their shape ( all of them are circles indicating a conformal projection ) while their size get larger and larger toward the poles .",
    "now if the goal is preserving size rather than shape , then we would make the horizontal and vertical scaling reciprocal , so the stretching in one direction will match shrinking in the other .",
    "thus , from eqs . and , we obtain @xmath33 or @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant . from eqs . and , we can choose @xmath35 in such away that for a given latitude , the map also preserves the shape in that area .",
    "for instance if @xmath19 , then we choose @xmath36 , and so the map near equator is conformal too . hence , the equations for the cylindrical equal - area projection ( one of lambert s maps ) are @xmath37 fig .",
