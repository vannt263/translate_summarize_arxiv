    "it is common practice to study a system s linear stability properties to gain insight into turbulent dynamics .",
    "it is often easier to calculate and analyze linear modes and growth rates than to simulate and analyze nonlinear turbulence .",
    "however , there are several situations in which linear properties can be misleading in understanding turbulent systems .",
    "first , linear studies of magnetically confined plasmas that neglect stable branches of the linear dispersion relation often miss details of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "for example , stable eigenmodes can often impact nonlinear dynamics by providing energy sinks and sometimes energy sources not found on the most unstable linear branch  @xcite .",
    "stable eigenmodes can shift the energy injection and dissipation ranges , making the turbulent dynamics very different from the kolmogorov picture of hydrodynamic turbulence  @xcite .",
    "second , systems with non - normal modes ( non - orthogonal eigenvectors ) display properties that are unexpected from linear calculations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , systems with non - normal modes even make it difficult to predict dynamics when stable eigenmode branches are included in analyses  @xcite .",
    "third , linear stability analysis can miss crucial nonlinear instability effects , which come in several varieties .",
    "the most obvious variety of a nonlinear instability effect is that of subcritical turbulence in which no linear instabilities exist but turbulence is self - sustained given finite - amplitude seed perturbations .",
    "subcritical turbulence is common in hydrodynamics  @xcite . while not as well - known in plasma physics , several cases of subcritical plasma instabilities have been shown in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the second variety of nonlinear instability includes cases in which a particular linear instability is present in a system , but the turbulence is maintained by a nonlinear instability mechanism with different physical origin than the linear instability mechanism .",
    "this has been explored in tokamak edge simulations in which linear ballooning instability drive is overtaken in the saturated phase by a nonlinear drift - wave drive  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is often found that a particular linear instability is enhanced , depressed , and/or modified in the saturated phase by a nonlinear instability with a similar mechanism as the linear instability . in some of these cases",
    "nonlinear wavenumber transfers can increase or cause drive  @xcite , while in other cases zonal flow effects decrease drive  @xcite .    in order to avoid the pitfalls of relying too heavily on linear stability calculations in forming conclusions on turbulence characteristics , it is useful to perform turbulent simulations and diagnose them with energy dynamics analyses . energy dynamics analyses track energy input into turbulent fluctuations and energy dissipation out of them .",
    "they also track conservative energy transfer between different energy types ( e.g. from potential to kinetic energy ) and between different scales , waves , or eigenmodes of a system . in all",
    ", energy dynamics analysis can be used as a post - processing tool to characterize simulation turbulence in order to gain insight into underlying physical processes .    in this study ,",
    "a simulation of a two - fluid braginskii model of turbulence in the large plasma device ( lapd ) is subjected to such an energy dynamics analysis .",
    "this reveals that a nonlinear instability drives and maintains the turbulence in the steady state saturated phase of the simulation .",
    "while a linear resistive drift wave instability resides in the system , the nonlinear drift wave instability dominates when the mean fluctuation amplitude is over a few percent of the equilibrium value .",
    "the primary linear instability is the resistive drift wave which has a positive linear growth rate for low but finite @xmath3 .",
    "however , the saturated state of the simulated turbulence is strongly dominated by flute - like ( @xmath0 ) fluctuations in density and potential .",
    "the flute - like fluctuation spectrum is generated by a nonlinear instability .",
    "the nonlinear instability is identified by its energy growth rate spectrum , which varies significantly from the linear growth rate spectrum . if @xmath2 fluctuations are removed from the simulation ( while retaining zonal flows )",
    ", the saturated turbulent state is qualitatively and quantitatively different and much less consistent with experimental measurement .",
    "a braginskii - based fluid model  @xcite is used to simulate drift wave turbulence in lapd using the bout++ code  @xcite .",
    "the evolved variables in the model are the plasma density , @xmath4 , the electron fluid parallel velocity @xmath5 , the potential vorticity @xmath6 , and the electron temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the ions are assumed cold in the model ( @xmath8 ) , which eliminates ion temperature gradient drive , and sound wave effects are neglected .",
    "details of the simulation code and derivations of the model may be found in previous lapd verification and validation studies  @xcite , although electron temperature fluctuations were not included in those studies .",
    "the equations are developed with bohm normalizations : lengths are normalized to the ion sound gyroradius @xmath9 , times to the ion cyclotron time @xmath10 , velocities to the sound speed @xmath11 , densities to the equilibrium peak density , and electron temperatures and potentials to the equilibrium peak electron temperature .",

    "the simulations use periodic boundary conditions in the axial ( @xmath30 ) direction and dirichlet boundary conditions in the radial ( @xmath27 ) direction for the fluctuating quantities .",

    "these sources suppress the azimuthal averages ( @xmath33 component of the density and temperature fluctuations ) at each time step .",

    "the simulation reproduces these characteristics of experimental measurements with rather good qualitative and quantitative accuracy .",
    "in order to perform an energy dynamics analysis on the simulation , expressions for the energy and energy evolution must be derived from eqs .",
    "[ ni_eq]-[te_eq ] . to start , an expression for the normalized energy of the wave fluctuations in the drift wave model is defined as :    [ energy_eq ] e = _ v ( n^2 + t_e^2 + v_e^2 + n_0 ( _ ) ^2 ) dv .",
    "the @xmath36 contribution is the potential energy due to density fluctuations , @xmath37 is the electron temperature fluctuation potential energy , @xmath38 is the parallel electron kinetic energy , and @xmath39 is the @xmath28 perpendicular kinetic energy .",
    "these energy - like expressions are defined in this way so that they are conserved individually by their respective advective nonlinearities .",

    "the fact that the advective nonlinearities conserve energy means that they can transfer energy between different fourier modes but they can not change the energy of the volume - averaged fluctuations as a whole . only the linear terms can change the total energy of the fluctuations . other possible nonlinearities that do not conserve energy are not included in the model equation set or in the simulations for simplicity of the energy analysis .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient for the simulations to employ an energy conserving finite difference scheme for the advective nonlinearities to reflect this analytic property of the equations .",

    "this has to be a nonlinear effect because the linear eigenmodes are fourier modes in the azimuthal and axial directions and all fields grow at the same rate for an eigenmode .",
    "another property unexpected from linear stability analysis is that most of the potential and perpendicular kinetic energy ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath84 ) is contained in @xmath82 ( @xmath87 ) structures , which are often called flute modes .",

    "the nonconservative linear terms , after all , can only inject , dissipate , or transfer energy at one wavenumber at a time , so it takes @xmath82 fluctuations to nonconservatively inject energy into @xmath82 fluctuations .",
    "note also that the temperature fluctuations work in the same way as the density fluctuations , and one could replace @xmath90 ( the spectral density component ) with @xmath91 ( the spectral temperature component ) in the diagram .",
    "the density and temperature are analogous and work in parallel , however the temperature fluctuations are a few times smaller than the density fluctuations and provide weaker drive because parallel heat conduction strongly dissipates the temperature fluctuations .",

    "despite the fact that the equilibrium temperature gradient is nearly as steep as the density gradient at its steepest point , its free energy is not used efficiently by the waves in the sense that it is largely dissipated before being transferred to the electrostatic potential .",
    "the reason for the difference between the density and temperature responses is the extra dissipation routes for the temperature fluctuations , namely , the parallel heat conduction and electron - ion heat exchange .",
    "one should therefore be careful in assuming that adding free energy sources to an analysis will automatically increase instability drive .",

    "it is obvious that the nonlinear wavenumber transfers must take energy from the injection region to the dissipation region on average , and that is consistent with what was shown in fig .",
    "[ conservative_transfers ] .",
    "this further reveals a picture quite different than what one would expect from the standard picture of plasma turbulence in which energy is injected where the _ linear _ growth rate is positive and dissipated where it is negative .",

    "although the nonlinear flute mode dynamics present a clear case of nonlinear instability , the @xmath125 energy path is not a necessary feature of nonlinear drift wave instabilities , which is clear in tokamak studies of drift wave turbulence  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the periodic axial boundary conditions used in the lapd turbulence simulation are obviously unphysical , and more realistic boundary conditions may change the parallel dynamics disallowing an exact @xmath125 path .",
    "in essence , it is interesting to test the robustness of nonlinear instability in this system . in particular , how important are the idealized flute modes to the nonlinear instability ?",
    "they are after all , not essential to the otherwise similar nonlinear drift - like instabilities in the tokamak edge simulations  @xcite .",
    "now , there are a few ways to eliminate the flute modes in the simulation such as eliminating one of the nonlinearities that is essential to the nonlinear instability process described in fig .",
    "[ nl_instability_diagram ] . however , simply subtracting out the @xmath82 components of the density and potential at each simulation time step retains more of the physics that may be essential to cause nonlinear instability .",
    "the energy dynamics of such a simulation , which are succinctly summarized by the growth rate spectrum , are shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma_no_n0_figs ] .",
    "interestingly , with no @xmath82 fluctuations , the turbulent growth rate spectrum @xmath124 is nearly identical to the linear growth rate spectrum @xmath119 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ gamma_no_n0_figs](a ) .",
    "it is noted that subtracting out the @xmath82 potential component removes the zonal flow ( @xmath126 ) from the system , providing a possible explanation for the large change in behavior of the turbulent growth rate spectrum .",
    "however , this hypothesis is dispelled by the analysis of a simulation in which only the @xmath127 potential components are removed while the zonal flow is left intact .",
    "the growth rate spectrum of this simulation , shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma_no_n0_figs]b , reveals that the zonal flow plays a minimal role in the nonlinear instability dynamics .",
    "the zonal flow simply decreases the growth rates by a small amount , causing no change to the qualitative picture .",
    "components removed is not broadband , but has a clear peak , which is inconsistent with experiment . ]    the flute modes are therefore necessary for a nonlinear instability to overtake the linear instability in driving the turbulence , making this qualitatively different from the tokamak edge studies .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from this result that a 2d simplification using a fixed parallel wavelength like the 2d hasegawa - wakatani model  @xcite does not support a nonlinear instability .",
    "nevertheless , one indication that the nonlinear flute - driven instability is important in reproducing experimentally consistent turbulence is that the turbulence of the simulation with the @xmath82 components removed becomes overly coherent .",
    "this can be seen in the frequency spectrum , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ freq_spectra3 ] compared with the experimental spectra and the spectra of the standard nonlinear - instability - dominated simulation . while the standard simulation with the @xmath82 modes retained compares well with experimental data , the spectrum of the simulation with @xmath82 modes removed does not .",

    "apparently the @xmath82 modes and the nonlinear instability are important for reproducing experimentally relevant turbulence .",

    "the kind of energy analysis used in this study is one way in which detailed physics can be drawn from a turbulence simulation . here",
    ", energy dynamics analysis shows a complex picture of turbulent energy injection , transfer , and dissipation .",
    "such a picture was certainly not evident _ a priori_. other more advanced procedures such as eigenmode decompositions  @xcite or proper orthogonal decompositions ( pod )  @xcite , which are extensions of this procedure , can reveal even more physical processes , especially those involving saturation .    in this study , a partial spectral decomposition and energy dynamics analysis was sufficient to reveal the dominance of a nonlinear instability in driving and maintaining the turbulence .",
    "the nonlinear instability works by driving @xmath0 pressure fluctuations using @xmath0 pressure and potential fluctuations to access the free energy pressure gradients . these @xmath0 pressure fluctuations are _ not _ driven by conservative nonlinear energy transfer from linear drift waves nor by some primary linear flow - driven instability .",
    "the @xmath0 potential fluctuations are driven through the finite @xmath3 adiabatic response in combination with forward and reverse axial wavenumber transfers .",
    "not only does the nonlinear instability require the @xmath128 transfer path to operate , but the simulation requires this to produce experimentally consistent broadband turbulence . in the future , this study will be expanded to include different and more realistic axial boundary conditions  including conducting plate boundaries  to further test the importance of the flute modes in creating broadband turbulence . furthermore , different operating conditions in lapd , including those that produce large mean flows will be simulated and studied to test for the emergence of new dominant instabilities , possibly nonlinear ones .",
    "understanding nonlinear instabilities is important because they can invalidate the use of quasilinear flux estimates and linear mixing length arguments of turbulent transport levels when linear instabilities are insignificant in the turbulent state .",
    "simple rules for when nonlinear instabilities will act or overtake linear ones are needed , and one attempt at such a rule has been made elsewhere for drift wave turbulence  @xcite .",
    "that rule states that nonlinear instabilities will overtake linear instabilities when @xmath129 , which is true for the parameters used in this study",
    ". however , more study of this rule and others is warranted , and will be important as long as linear calculations are used to inform predictions of turbulence .",
    "nevertheless , full nonlinear simulations and energy dynamics analyses are most informative and should be used to obtain details of plasma turbulence mechanisms .",
