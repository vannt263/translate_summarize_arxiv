    "an analysis of all the available data ( short baseline lsnd , reactor and accelerator , long baseline atmospheric , and extraterrestrial length solar ) in terms of neutrino oscillations leads to the conclusion that three independent oscillation lengths are contributing .",
    "this then further requires mixing of at least four light  mass neutrinos .",
    "for a four light  mass neutrino universe , we draw the following model  independent conclusions : + ( i ) the 1 + 3 ( or 3 + 1 ) mass spectrum with a separated mass is disfavored when all the data ( lsnd , reactor , accelerator , solar , and atmospheric ) are considered , leaving a spectrum with two nearly  degenerate pairs as preferred ; + ( ii ) the neutrino mixing matrix elements satisfy @xmath324 if @xmath325  ev@xmath9 , i.e. , the parameters lie near the bugey @xmath6 disappearance limit ; + ( iii ) the relation @xmath326 is inferred from the near  maximal mixing of atmospheric @xmath1 s measured by superk , which together with ( ii ) implies @xmath327 .    based upon the apparent need for more than three light neutrinos , we have presented four - neutrino models with three active neutrinos and one sterile neutrino .",

    "the models predict @xmath328 ( or @xmath26 ) and @xmath265 oscillations in long  baseline experiments with @xmath33  km / gev with amplitudes that are determined by the lsnd oscillation amplitude and @xmath5 scale determined by the oscillation scale of atmospheric neutrinos . for the @xmath27 case",
