    "while @xmath5 and @xmath6 have been determined to a good level of precision  @xcite , the measurement of @xmath7 is still limited by the smallness of the branching ratios involved in the processes used to measure it , and its relative uncertainty varies between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , depending on the method used to combine the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "there are several methods to measure @xmath2 , the ones with the smallest theoretical uncertainties make use of the tree - level dominated @xmath1 decays ( where @xmath10 labels either @xmath11 or @xmath12 mesons )  @xcite .",
