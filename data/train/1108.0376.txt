    "magneto - acousto - electric tomography ( maet ) is based on the measurements of the electrical potential arising when an acoustic wave propagates through conductive medium placed in a constant magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the mechanical motion of the free charges ( ions and/or electrons ) with the magnetic field results in the lorentz force that pushes charges of different signs in opposite directions , thus generating lorentz currents within the tissue .",
    "the goal of this technique coincides with that of the electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) : to reconstruct the conductivity of the tissue from the values of the electric potential measured on the boundary of the object .",
    "eit is a fast , inexpensive , and harmless modality , which is potentially very valuable due to the large contrast in the conductivity between healthy and cancerous tissues  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the reconstruction problems arising in eit are known to be exponentially unstable .",
    "maet is one of the several recently introduced hybrid imaging techniques designed to stabilize the reconstruction of electrical properties of the tissues by coupling together ultrasound waves with other physical phenomena .",
    "perhaps the best known examples of hybrid methods are the thermo - acoustic tomography ( tat )  @xcite and the closely related photo - acoustic modality , pat  @xcite ) . in the latter methods the amount of electromagnetic energy absorbed by the medium is reconstructed from the measurements ( on the surface of the object ) of acoustic waves caused by the thermoacoustic expansion ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another hybrid technique , designed to overcome shortcomings of eit and yield stable reconstruction of the conductivity is acousto - electric impedance tomography ( aeit )  @xcite .",
    "it couples together acoustic waves and electrical currents , through the electroacoustic effect ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "although aeit has been shown , both theoretically and in numerical simulations , to be stable and capable of yielding high - resolution images  @xcite , the feasibility of practical reconstructions is still in question due to the extreme weakness of the acousto - electric effect .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze maet which also aims to reconstruct the conductivity in a stable fashion . in maet",
    "this goal is achieved by combining magnetic field , acoustic excitation and electric measurements , coupled through the lorentz force .",
    "the physical foundations of maet were established in @xcite and  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if the tissue with conductivity @xmath0 moves with velocity @xmath1 within the constant magnetic field @xmath2 , the arising lorentz force will generate lorentz currents @xmath3 whose intensity and direction are given ( approximately ) by the following formula@xmath4    originally  @xcite it was proposed to utilize a focused propagating acoustic pulse to induce electric response from different parts of the object . in  @xcite wavepackets of a certain frequency",
    "were used in a physical experiment to reconstruct the current density in a thin slab of a tissue .",
    "similarly , in  @xcite the use of a perfectly focused acoustic beam was assumed in a theoretical study and in numerical simulations . however , in the above - quoted works accurate mathematical model(s ) of such beams were not presented . moreover ,",
    "the feasibility of focusing a fixed frequency acoustic beam at an arbitrary point inside the body in a fully 3d problem is problematic . in a theoretical study  @xcite the use of plane waves of varying frequencies",
    "was proposed instead of the beams .",
    "this is a more realistic approach ; however , the analysis in that work relies on several crude approximations ( the conductivity is assumed to be close to 1 , and the electric field is approximated by the first non - zero term in the multipole expansion ) .    to summarize , the existing mathematical models of measurements in maet are of approximate nature ; moreover , some of them contradict to others .",
    "for example , it was found in  @xcite that if one uses a pair of electrodes to measure the voltage ( difference of the potentials ) at two points @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the boundary of the body , the result is the integral of the mixed product of three vectors : velocity @xmath7 , magnetic induction @xmath2 and the so - called lead current @xmath8 ( the current that would flow in the body if the difference of potentials were applied at points @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the approximate model in  @xcite implicitly agrees with this conclusion .",
    "however , in  @xcite it is assumed that if the pulse is focused at the point @xmath9 , the measurements will be proportional to the product of the electric potential @xmath10 and conductivity @xmath0 at that point .",
    "this assumption contradicts the previous models ; it also seems to be unrealistic since potential @xmath10 is only defined up to an arbitrary constant , while the measurements are completely determined by the physics of the problem .    in the present paper",
    "we first derive , starting from equation  ( [ e : lorentz ] ) , a rigorous and sufficiently general model of the maet measurements .",
    "next , we show that if a sufficient amount of data is measured , one can reconstruct , almost explicitly and in a stable fashion the conductivity of the tissue . for general domains the reconstruction can be reduced to the solution of the inverse problem of tat followed by the solution of the neumann problem for the laplace equation , and a poisson equation . in the simpler case of a rectangular domain",
    "the reconstruction formulae can be made completely explicit , and the solution is obtained by summing several fourier series . in the latter case the algorithm is fast , i.e. it runs in @xmath11 floating point operations on a @xmath12 grid .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations show that one can stably recover high resolution images of the conductivity of the tissues from maet  measurements even in the presence of a significant noise in the data .",
    "suppose that the object of interest whose conductivity @xmath0 we would like to recover is supported within an open and bounded region @xmath13 with the boundary @xmath14 .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that @xmath0 is smooth in @xmath15 does not approach 0 , and equals 1 in the vicinity of @xmath14 ; the support of @xmath16 lies in some @xmath17 and the distance between @xmath18 and @xmath14 is non - zero .",
    "the object is placed in the magnetic field with a constant magnetic induction  @xmath2 , and an acoustic wave generated by a source lying outside @xmath13 propagates through the object with the velocity @xmath1 .",
    "then the lorentz force will induce lorentz currents in @xmath13 given by equation  ( [ e : lorentz ] ) . throughout the text",
    "we assume that the electrical interactions occur on much faster time scale than the mechanical ones , and so all currents and electric potentials depend on @xmath19 only as a parameter .",
    "in addition to lorentz currents , the arising electrical potential @xmath20 will generate secondary , ohmic currents with intensities given by ohm s law@xmath21 since there are no sinks or sources of electric charges within the tissues , the total current @xmath22 is divergence - free@xmath23 thus@xmath24 since there are no currents through the boundary , the normal component of the total current @xmath22 vanishes : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the exterior normal to @xmath14 at point @xmath27 .",
    "we will assume that the boundary values of the potential @xmath28 can be measured at all points @xmath27 lying on @xmath14 .",
    "more precisely , we will model the measurements by integrating the boundary values with a weight @xmath29 and thus forming measuring functional @xmath30 defined by the formula@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the standard area element .",
    "weight @xmath29 can be a function or a distribution , subject to the restriction @xmath33 in particular , if one chooses to use @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the 2d dirac delta - function , then @xmath30 models the two - point measuring scheme utilized in  @xcite and  @xcite .    in order to understand what kind of information",
    "is encoded in the values of @xmath36 let us consider solution @xmath37 of the following divergence equation @xmath38 ( to ensure the uniqueness of the solution of the above boundary value problem we will require that the integral of @xmath39 over @xmath13 vanishes . )",
    "then @xmath37 equals the electric potential that would be induced in the tissues by injecting currents @xmath40 at the boundary @xmath14 .",
    "let us denote the corresponding currents @xmath41 by @xmath42:@xmath43    let us now apply the second green s identity to functions @xmath20 , @xmath44 , and @xmath0:@xmath45dx=\\int\\limits_{\\partial\\omega}\\sigma\\left [   w_{j}% \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n}u - u\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n}w_{j}\\right ]   da(z ) .",

    "it is clear from equation  ( [ e : vcrossb ] ) that maet measurements recover some information about currents @xmath50 . in order to gain further insight",
    "let us assume that the acoustical properties of the medium , such as speed of sound @xmath51 and density @xmath52 are approximately constant within @xmath13 .",
    "( such approximation usually holds in breast imaging which is one of the most important potential applications of this and similar modalities ) .",
    "then the acoustic pressure @xmath53 within @xmath13 satisfies the wave equation@xmath54 additionally , @xmath53 is the time derivative of the velocity potential @xmath55 ( see , for example  @xcite ) , so that @xmath56 velocity potential @xmath55 also satisfies the wave equation@xmath57 now , by taking into account  ( [ e : velpoten ] ) , equation  ( [ e : vcrossb ] ) can be re - written as@xmath58 further , by noticing that@xmath59 we obtain@xmath60",

    "for example , if at some moment of time @xmath19 velocity potential @xmath55 vanishes on the boundary @xmath14 , then the surface integral in  ( [ e : surfterm ] ) also vanishes:@xmath61 similarly , if boundary @xmath14 is located far away from the support of inhomogeneity of @xmath0 , the surface integral in  ( [ e : surfterm ] ) can be neglected , and we again obtain equation  ( [ e : model ] ) .    equation  ( [ e : surfterm ] ) is our mathematical model of the maet measurements . our goal is to reconstruct from measurements @xmath36 conductivity @xmath0  by varying , if necessary , @xmath2 , @xmath55 , and @xmath29 .",
    "our strategy for solving this problem is outlined in the following sections .",
    "however , some conclusions can be reached just by looking at the equation ( [ e : surfterm ] ) .",
    "for example , one can notice that if three sets of measurements are conducted with magnetic induction pointing respectively in the directions of canonical basis vectors @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , one can easily reconstruct the sum of integrals in the brackets in  ( [ e : surfterm ] ) .",
    "further , if one focuses @xmath55 so that at the moment @xmath65 it becomes the dirac @xmath66-function centered at @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 then one immediately obtains the value of @xmath69 at the point @xmath67 ( such a focusing is theoretically possible as explained in the next section ) .",
    "thus , by moving the focusing point through the object , one can reconstruct the curl of @xmath70 in all of @xmath13 .",
    "our model also explains the observation reported in  @xcite that no signal is obtained when the acoustic wavepacket is passing through the regions of the constant @xmath0 . in such regions",
    "current @xmath70 is a potential vector field and , therefore , the integral in  ( [ e : model ] ) vanishes .",
    "finally , it becomes clear that an accurate image reconstruction is impossible if monochromatic acoustic waves of only a single frequency @xmath71 are used for scanning , no matter how well they are focused . in this case",
    "the spatial component @xmath72 of @xmath73 is a solution of the helmholtz equation@xmath74 and , within @xmath13 it can be approximated by the plane waves in the form @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that the electrical boundary is removed to infinity .",
    "then , measuring @xmath36 given by equation  ( [ e : model ] ) is equivalent to collecting values of the fourier transform of @xmath77 corresponding to the wave vectors @xmath78 lying on the surface of the sphere @xmath76 in the fourier domain .",
    "the spatial frequencies of function @xmath77 with wave vectors that do not lie on this sphere can not be recovered .",
    "the first step toward the reconstruction of the conductivity is to reconstruct currents @xmath50 corresponding to certain choices of @xmath29 .",
    "let us assume that all the measurements are repeated three times , with magnetic induction @xmath2 pointing respectively in the directions of canonical basis vectors @xmath79 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . then , as mentioned above , if @xmath80 , one readily recovers from the measurements @xmath81 the curl of the current at @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath82 . generating such a velocity potential is possible at least theoretically . for example , if one simultaneously propagates plane waves @xmath83 with all possible wave vectors @xmath78 , the combined velocity potential at the moment @xmath65 will add up to the dirac delta - function @xmath84 .",
    "such an arrangement is unlikely to be suitable for a practical implementation : firstly , the sources of sound would have to be removed far from the object to produce a good approximation to plane waves within the object .",
    "secondly , the sources would have to completely surround the object to irradiate it from all possible directions .",
    "finally , all the sources would have to be synchronized .",
    "a variation of this approach is to place small point - like sources in the vicinity of the object . in this case , instead of plane waves , spherical monochromatic waves or propagating spherical fronts would be generated .",
    "these types of waves can also be focused into a delta - function ( some discussion of such focusing and a numerical example can be found in  @xcite ) .      however , a more practical approach is to utilize some realistic measuring configuration ( e.g. one consisting of one or several small sources scanning the boundary sequentially ) , and then to synthesize algorithmically from the realistic data the desired measurements that correspond to the delta - like velocity potential .",
    "such a _ synthetic focusing _ was first introduced in the context of hybrid methods in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown , in applications to aet and to the acoustically modulated optical tomography , that such a synthetic focusing is equivalent to solving the inverse problem of tat .",
    "the latter problem has been studied extensively , and a wide variety of methods is known by now ( we will refer the reader to reviews  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the same technique can be applied to maet , as explained below .",
    "let us consider a spherical propagating front originated at the point @xmath67 .",

    "the choice of the tat inversion method for application in maet will depend , in particular , on the mutual location of the electric boundary @xmath14 and the acoustic source surface @xmath112 .",
    "one can decide to move the electric boundary further away by placing the object in a liquid with conductivity equal to 1 and by submerging the acoustic sources into the liquid , in which case @xmath112 will be inside @xmath14 .",

    "<S> magneto - acousto - electric tomography ( maet ) , also known as the lorentz force or hall effect tomography , is a novel hybrid modality designed to be a high - resolution alternative to the unstable electrical impedance tomography . in the present paper we analyze existing mathematical models of this method , and propose a general procedure for solving the inverse problem associated with maet . </S>",
    "<S> it consists in applying to the data one of the algorithms of thermo - acoustic tomography , followed by solving the neumann problem for the laplace equation and the poisson equation .    for the particular case when the region of interest is a cube , we present an explicit series solution resulting in a fast reconstruction algorithm . as we show , both analytically and numerically </S>",
    "<S> , maet is a stable technique yilelding high - resolution images even in the presence of significant noise in the data .    </S>",
