    "radioactive mirror nuclei @xmath1c and @xmath1o in the ground state are very similar by their structures , a small difference being produced by an additional coulomb repulsion in @xmath1o nucleus as compared to @xmath1c one .",
    "this fact can be used to determine the radius of the very rare isotope @xmath1o not yet measured experimentally .",
    "the idea is to treat both nuclei within one approach under the condition that the experimental radius of @xmath1c is well fitted , as well as the experimental binding energies of these nuclei .",
    "the contribution of the additional coulomb repulsion can be taken into account accurately , and thus the radius of @xmath1o nucleus can be obtained .    in the present paper , we consider the mirror nuclei @xmath1c and @xmath1o as composed from three @xmath0-particles and two extra nucleons ( neutrons in @xmath1c nucleus and protons in @xmath1o one ) . such model",
    "@xcite may have a rather good accuracy as it was shown by calculations of the structure functions of three- and four - cluster nuclei @xcite consisting of @xmath0-particles and two extra nucleons .",
    "for the ground state of both nuclei and some low - lying energy levels ( for which the excitation of an @xmath0-particle can be neglected ) , our five - particle model can be competitive in accuracy with the approaches like @xcite , where one has to deal with all the nucleon degrees of freedom . to solve the five - particle problem",
    ", we exploit the variational method with gaussian bases @xcite widely used to study the bound states of few - particle systems .    in the next section",
    ", the formulation of the hamiltonian is given .",
    "the radii of both nuclei and density distributions are discussed in section 3 . in sections 4 , 5 , and 7",
    ", we present the rest main structure functions of @xmath1c and @xmath1o nuclei ( elastic charge form factors , pair correlation functions , and the momentum distributions of @xmath0-particles and extra nucleons ) .",
    "in section 6 , we study the characteristic features of the ground - state wave functions of both nuclei , where two spatial configurations are revealed .",
    "within our five - particle model , the hamiltonian for @xmath1o nucleus is assumed to have the form : @xmath3 -2 mm @xmath4 where indices @xmath5 and @xmath0 denote a proton and an @xmath0-particle , respectively . in ( 1 ) , @xmath6 are the charges of protons ( in units of elementary charge @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 are the charges of @xmath0-particles ( in the same units ) .    within our model ,",
    "the hamiltonian for @xmath1c nucleus is very similar to ( [ e1 ] ) , but with @xmath9 , since the neutrons have zero charge .",
    "we assume the potentials @xmath10 are the same for both nuclei , as well as the interaction potential between the extra neutrons @xmath11 coincides with @xmath12 due to the charge independence of nuclear forces .",
    "as for the potentials @xmath13 in the case of @xmath1o nucleus and @xmath14 in the case of @xmath1c one , their parameters may be slightly different , because the density distributions of protons and neutrons inside the @xmath0-particle are not identical mainly due to the coulomb repulsion between protons .",
    "we note that the local potential @xmath11 in the singlet state was successfully used in studying the structure of @xmath15he @xcite and @xmath16be @xcite nuclei . the potentials @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as well as the interaction potential between @xmath0-particles @xmath19 are of a generalized type with local and non - local ( separable ) terms .",
    "this type of potentials was first proposed @xcite to simulate the exchange effects between particles in interacting clusters and was successfully used , in particular , in calculations @xcite of multicluster nuclei .",
    "the parameters of the interaction potentials used in this work are given in @xcite , and the calculations within our model with these potentials result in the experimental binding energies of both nuclei under consideration , as well as the experimental charge radius of @xmath1c nucleus .    the ground - state energy and the wave function are calculated with the use of variational method in the gaussian representation @xcite , which proved its high accuracy in calculations of few - particle systems . for the ground @xmath20 state ,",
    "the wave function can be expressed in the form @xmath21where @xmath22 is the symmetrization operator , and the linear coefficients @xmath23 and nonlinear parameters @xmath24 are variational parameters .",
    "the greater the dimension @xmath25 of the basis , the more accurate the result can be obtained .",
    "the linear coefficiens can be found within the galerkin method from the system of linear equations determining the energy of the system : @xmath26the matrix elements in ( [ e3 ] ) are known to have explicit form for potentials like the coulomb potential or the ones having a gaussian expansion .",
    "our potentials @xcite between particles just have the form of a few gaussian functions , including the gaussian form factor in the separable repulsive term .",
    "thus , system ( [ e3 ] ) becomes a system of algebraic equations .",
    "we achieved the necessary high accuracy , by using up to @xmath27 functions of the gaussian basis .",
    "to fix the non - linear variational parameters @xmath24 , we used both the stochastic approach @xcite and regular variational methods .",
    "this enables us to obtain the best accuracy at reasonable values of the dimension @xmath25 .    as a result",
    ", we have the wave functions of the ground state for both nuclei under consideration within the five - particle model .",
    "this enables us to analyze the structure functions of @xmath1c and @xmath1o nuclei . in the next section , the charge density distributions and charge r.m.s",
    "radii are discussed .",
    "the probability density distribution @xmath28 of the @xmath29-th particle in a system of particles with the wave function @xmath30 is known to be @xmath31where @xmath32 is the center of mass of the system .",
    "the probability density distributions are normalized as @xmath33 .    in fig .  1",
    ", we depict the values @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , for the density distributions of extra protons and @xmath0-particles in @xmath1o nucleus .",
    "the profiles very close to those shown in fig .  1 were obtained for @xmath1c nucleus in @xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that extra nucleons in both nuclei move mainly inside the @xmath36c cluster formed by @xmath0-particles . at the same time",
    ", the secondary maximum of curve @xmath37 at @xmath38 fm means that the extra protons in @xmath1o nucleus can be found off the @xmath36c cluster ( with a probability @xmath39 ) .",
    "similarly , the extra neutrons in @xmath1c nucleus can be found off the @xmath36c cluster ( with a probability @xmath40 ) .",
    "two above - mentioned maxima on curve @xmath37 are the consequence of two configurations distinctly present in the nuclei under consideration ( see below ) .     obtained for extra protons ( curve @xmath37 ) and @xmath0-particles ( curve @xmath41 ) in @xmath1o nucleus , title=\"fig : \" ] -2 mm    to find the r.m.s .",
    "radius @xmath42 of the density distribution @xmath28 , one has to calculate the integral @xmath43 . in table  1 ,",
    "the main calculated parameters are given for both nuclei .",
    "in particular , the r.m.s .",
    "radii @xmath44 and @xmath45 obtained for `` pointlike '' extra neutrons and @xmath0-particles in @xmath1c nucleus are seen to be less than the corresponding r.m.s .",
    "radii @xmath46 and @xmath45 for @xmath1o system .",
    "this is explained by the additional coulomb repulsion in @xmath1o nucleus due to the presence of extra protons instead of extra neutrons present in @xmath1c . as a result , the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the mass distribution @xmath47 in @xmath1o is also larger than @xmath47 for @xmath1c . at the same time",
    ", we have @xmath48 for both nuclei ( where @xmath49 for @xmath1c and @xmath50 for @xmath1o ) .",
    "this inequality is directly related to the fact that the extra nucleons are settled mainly inside the @xmath36c cluster ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) .",
    "6.0pt    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to find the charge density distributions of the nuclei with regard for finite sizes of @xmath0-particles and extra protons , we use the helm approximation @xcite . within this approach , the charge density distribution for @xmath1c nucleus , @xmath51is a convolution product of the density distribution @xmath52 for the probability to find an @xmath53-particle inside the @xmath1c nucleus with the charge density distribution @xmath54 of an @xmath0-particle itself .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is calculated within our five - particle model , while @xmath54 follows from the experimental form factor @xcite . in relation ( [ e5 ] ) , we neglect the small contribution of extra neutrons .",
    "we normalize the charge density distribution as @xmath55 , i.e. one has to multiply it by @xmath56 to obtain the necessary dimensional units .    in case of @xmath1o nucleus , instead of ( [ e5 ] )",
    ", we have two following terms in the expression for @xmath57 due to the role of extra protons : @xmath58 ( the coefficients 3/4 and 1/4 are proportional to the charges of three @xmath0-particles and two extra protons , respectively ) .",
    "the charge density distributions for @xmath1c and @xmath1o nuclei are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for comparison , the dashed line presents the density distribution of the probability to find an @xmath0-particle in @xmath1c nucleus ( almost the same distribution could be shown for @xmath1o ) .",
    "we distinctly see a dip near the origin in the probability density distribution of `` poinlike '' @xmath0-particles , but the integration in the convolution product ( [ e5 ] ) , i.e. , the account for a finite size of @xmath0-particles , results in the maximum of the charge density distribution of @xmath1c nucleus near @xmath59 , nothing to say about @xmath1o nucleus , where the contribution of charged extra protons in ( [ e6 ] ) makes the maximum at @xmath59 even more pronounced . since the distributions are normalized to 1 , the charge density distribution of @xmath1o nucleus should be lower than that of @xmath1c one at larger distances important for the calculation of the r.m.s .",
    "charge radii . as a result",
    ", we have the inequality : @xmath60[e7 ] within the helm approximation for the density distributions ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) , the charge radii squared are known to be @xmath61 @xmath62 due to the fact that @xmath63 , i.e. the extra protons move ( on the average ) closer to the center of @xmath1o nucleus than the @xmath0-particles do ( see table 1 ) , and due to the well - known experimental fact that @xmath64 , we again confirm inequality ( [ e7 ] ) . the calculated r.m.s .",
    "charge radii are given in table  1 .",
    "since the errors of the experimental radius of an @xmath0-particle @xcite are of the order of @xmath65 fm , we estimate the accuracy of our result for the charge r.m.s .",
    "radius of @xmath1o to be of the order of @xmath66 fm .",

    "it is obvious that the mass r.m.s .",
    "radius of @xmath1o nucleus is , vice versa , greater than that of @xmath1c nucleus ( see table  1 ) , because both nuclei have very similar mass distribution structures , and @xmath1o nucleus has the lower binding energy and larger relative distances between particles due to the additional coulomb repulsion of extra protons .",
    "c and @xmath1o nuclei ( normalized as @xmath68 ) .",
    "the dashed line depicts the probability density distribution of @xmath0-particles in @xmath1c nucleus , title=\"fig : \" ] -2 mm",
    "the elastic charge form factor @xmath69 can be found by a fourier transformation of the density distribution @xmath57 , @xmath70 in the helm approximation for @xmath57 of @xmath1c nucleus , the convolution product ( [ e5 ] ) for the charge density distribution transforms to a product , and for the charge form factor of @xmath1c one has @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the fourier transform of the probability density distribution of @xmath0-particles in @xmath1c nucleus , and @xmath73 is the form factor of @xmath74he .",
    "the profile of @xmath72 is calculated within our five - particle model , and the form factor of @xmath74he nucleus is taken from the experiment @xcite .",
    "it is clear from expression ( [ e11 ] ) that the elastic charge form factor of @xmath1c nucleus should become zero at that momentum transfer squared @xmath75 where any of two multipliers in ( [ e11 ] ) becomes zero .",
    "the absolute value of the form factor at corresponding values of @xmath76 should have `` dips '' . in fig .  3 , we depict the absolute value of the elastic charge form factor ( [ e11 ] ) ( solid line ) together with both multipliers from the right - hand side of relation ( [ e11 ] ) ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the dip at @xmath77 @xmath78 is intrinsic to @xmath74he nucleus @xcite , and it reveals itself in all the form factors of light nuclei obtained within the @xmath0-particles plus some neutrons model ( see , e.g. , form factors of @xmath79he @xcite or @xmath16be @xcite ) .",
    "the dip at @xmath80 @xmath78 is proper to the form factor @xmath81 in ( [ e11 ] ) .",
    "since its properties are determined by three @xmath0-particles forming the @xmath36c cluster inside the @xmath1c nucleus , it is not surprising that we observe the first dip for the form factor of @xmath36c nucleus @xcite at almost the same @xmath82 @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the @xmath36c cluster in @xmath1c nucleus is only slightly disturbed by two extra neutrons , and just this cluster is responsible for the first dip in the elastic charge form factor of @xmath1c nucleus .",
    "passing to the charge form factor of @xmath1o nucleus , we should consider the contribution of extra protons to the charge density distribution ( [ e6 ] ) of this system . as a result , the elastic form factor , i.e. the fourier transform of the charge density distribution ( [ e6 ] ) , contains two terms : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a fourier transform of the probability density distribution of extra protons in @xmath1o nucleus , and @xmath85 is the charge form factor of the proton itself @xcite .",
    "the rest notations are similar to ones in formula ( [ e11 ] ) .",
    "although the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ e12 ] ) is very similar to expression ( [ e11 ] ) and becomes zero at the same momentum transfer squared @xmath76 as the form factor ( [ e11 ] ) does , the second term in ( [ e12 ] ) ( present due the extra protons ) is a smoothly decreasing function .",
    "thus , the total expression does not become zero , though the first term does . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the absolute value of the elastic charge form factor of @xmath1o nucleus is shown ( solid line 1 ) . in the contrary to the form factor of @xmath1c nucleus ( fig .",
    "3 ) , it has no dips within the presented range of @xmath76 .",

    "more information about the structures of @xmath1c and @xmath1o nuclei can be obtained from the analysis of the pair correlation functions .",
    "the pair correlation function @xmath87 for a pair of particles @xmath29 and @xmath88 can be defined as follows : @xmath89 and it is known to be the density of the probability to find the particles @xmath29 and @xmath88 at a definite distance @xmath90 . the r.m.s .",
    "relative distances squared @xmath91 are directly expressed through the pair correlation functions @xmath92 : @xmath93 the calculated r.m.s . relative distances between particles are given in table  1 for @xmath1c and @xmath1o nuclei . as was mentioned above , due to the additional coulomb repulsion in @xmath1o as compared to @xmath1c nucleus , all the corresponding relative distances in @xmath1o nucleus are greater than those in @xmath1c .",

    "radii @xmath42 are connected with the r.m.s .",
    "relative distances @xmath94 : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the total mass of the system of particles .",
    "thus , the r.m.s .",
    "radii could be calculated with the use of the pair correlation functions and relations ( [ e14 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) .    since the average of a pairwise local potential @xmath97 is expressible directly through the pair correlation function @xmath87 , @xmath98 the variational principle makes the profile of @xmath87 such that it has a maximum , where the potential is attractive , and a minimum in the area of repulsion ( if the role of the kinetic energy is not crucial ) .",
    "the @xmath0-particles have about four times greater mass than extra nucleons , and thus their kinetic energy is essentially smaller than that of nucleons ( see below ) . as a result , the pair correlation function @xmath99 profile is determined mainly by the potential @xmath100 and has a pronounced maximum ( curve 1 in fig .",
    "5 ) near the minimum of the potential attraction . on the other hand , due to the presence of a local repulsion in the same potential near the origin , the profile of @xmath99 has a dip at short distances .",
    "thus , the profile of @xmath99 shows that @xmath0-particles are mainly settled at a definite distances @xmath101 ( see table  1 ) and form a triangle of @xmath36c cluster .",
    "the extra nucleon pair correlation function ( @xmath102 for @xmath1c , as well as @xmath103 for @xmath1o ) , also has a dip at short distances ( see fig .  5 , curve 2 ) due to the presence of a short - range repulsion in our singlet nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath104 has no pronounced dip in the origin , since our model @xcite of generalized potential between a nucleon and an @xmath0-particle contains the local pure attractive potential plus the non - local ( separable ) repulsion of greater radius .",

    "two peaks on the @xmath108 surface are observed at @xmath114 , and only one peak at @xmath118 the rest angles give intermediate results ( see fig .  6 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) .",
    "if it were not the multiplier @xmath119 in ( [ e17 ] ) , the main peak present at all the angles @xmath111 would be settled just at @xmath120 , i.e. the center of mass of @xmath36c cluster and that of the dinucleon one would coincide .",
    "the second peak reveals itself mainly at @xmath114 , and it corresponds to a configuration , where the dinucleon subsystem touches the center of @xmath36c cluster by one of the extra nucleons , and another one is comparatively far from the center of the nucleus ( it is out of @xmath36c cluster ) .",
    "just this configuration makes a contribution to the second maximum of the extra nucleon probability density distribution ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in this configuration , the center of mass of the subsystem of extra nucleons does not coincide with the center of mass of @xmath36c cluster .",
