    "it is well known that for an arbitrary convex solid in three dimensions , the average projected area is one - fourth the surface area .",
    "perhaps less well - known is the story of how this theorem came to be known in the physics community .",
    "karl schwarzschild , a german astronomer primarily famous for his black hole solution to einstein s general relativity , proved the theorem near the turn of the twentieth century . perhaps due to his untimely death at forty - two in 1916 , however , the theorem was not well - known .",
    "so it remained for his son , astronomer martin schwarzschild , to prove the theorem after the second world war , unaware of his father s work ( knapp , personal communication ) .",
    "one can only imagine his surprise to learn from a colleague that his father had already proved it decades earlier !",
    "meanwhile , the result in 2 and 3 dimensions had been well - known in the mathematics community since cauchy s proof in works of 1841 and 1850 .",
    "the result in arbitrary dimension is known as `` cauchy s surface area formula '' for this reason , although he did not prove it for higher dimensions .",
    "but this was done by many others in the years following : minkowski , kubota , and bonnesen all offer proofs ( bonnesen & fenchel 1987 ; see also webster 1994 ) . essentially , the result may be seen as a special case of kubota s theorem ( see klain & rota 1997 , pp . 125 - 128 ; also schneider 1993 , pp .",
    "klain & rota present a so - called `` mean projection formula '' separately from cauchy s surface area formula , and interpret the former as a form of hadwiger s formula for compact convex sets ( cf .",
    "94 , 91 , 125 ) .",
    "the proofs used involve objects such as grassmannian measures and haar probability measures , which may be unfamiliar to many physicists . the proofs in bonnesen & fenchel ( 1987 ) and eggleston ( 1958 )",
    "are very similar to each other , and take a perhaps more elementary approach , but neither offers much intuition on why the formula holds .",
    "schneider ( 1993 ) simply proves a general mean value formula for projections , points out that what he terms kubota s integral recursion ( kubota s theorem in klain & rota ) is a special case , and that a further specialization of the latter offers cauchy s surface area formula .",
    "schneider s approach involves integrating over the group of rotations , as well as so - called mixed volumes and quermassintegrals , and we expect these may also be unfamiliar to many physicists .",
    "santalo s ( 1976 ) discussion is perhaps the most geometric and physically intuitive of the standard references , and that closest to our approach here .",
    "again , though , certain elements of the proof that may not be obvious are asserted without further detail , and not much physical picture is provided to offer intuition as to why the formula holds .",
    "therefore , it is hoped that the present work , while not an original result , will be of use especially to those in the physics community who may have little background in integral geometry or the theory of convex bodies . with this in mind , we spend some words developing a physical picture corresponding to the theorem in 3-@xmath2 , and then generalize this picture to provide an intuitive proof in higher dimensions .",
    "we also discuss applications of the theorem , both in 3-@xmath2 and in higher dimensions .",
    "finally , we provide a simple formula for calculating the ratio of average projected area to surface area in @xmath1 dimensions , and discuss the limiting behavior of this formula , both items unmentioned in the standard references discussed above .",
    "there are two equivalent , convenient ways to imagine average projected area .",
    "consider an arbitrary convex solid in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "now , hold the solid s position fixed , and shine a light beam behind it toward an observer in front of it",
    ". vary the light beam s direction ( and consequently the observer s location , since two points define a line and so the observer must move to see the solid s shadow ) through all possibilities , measure the area of the shadow cast at each , and average ( figure 1 ) .",
    "alternatively , one may hold the light beam ( and observer s ) position fixed and rotate the solid through all possible orientations , keeping its spatial location fixed .",
    "measure the shadows and average ( figure 2 ) .",
    "either method yields the same result  as one would expect , since they correspond to the same process but observed either in the rest frame of the solid or of the observer .",
    "[ f : movingobserver ]        [ f : movingsolid ]",
    "applications of the theorem are many . in astrophysics ,",
    "dust is along the path light takes from distant stars or galaxies to us , and so extinguishes some of the light .",
    "the dust grains are irregularly shaped and oriented , so it is necessary to correct for their average extinction of the incoming light .",
    "this theorem provides the most convenient way to do so .",
    "the next step is complex numerical simulations ; see e.g. draine 2011 .",
    "the theorem also readily allows one to calculate the temperature of dust grains ( or asteroids ) illumined by a star ( assuming the grains or asteroids are convex ) .",
    "the energy received by a dust grain is just proportional to its area as projected onto the light source s : clearly , the grain can not receive energy from any part of its surface not `` visible '' to the illumining star .",
    "however , the particle can radiate energy away proportionally to its surface area . setting energy absorbed per unit time equal to energy radiated per unit time (",
    "i.e. the luminosities @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) determines the equilibrium temperature : @xmath5 @xmath6 is the surface area of the grain , @xmath7 the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath8 the grain temperature , @xmath9 the average projected area of the grain , @xmath10 the star s temperature , @xmath11 the star s radius , @xmath2 the distance between the grain and the star , and @xmath12 the albedo , a measure of how reflective of light the grain is ( the higher @xmath12 , the less energy the grain absorbs ) .",
    "clearly , the ratio @xmath13 , is required to calculate the temperature of the grain .",
    "the average projected area theorem also has more terrestrial applications .",
    "it is a starting point for determining the 3-d shape of micro - particles using a 2-d map of their projected areas ( see vickers & brown 2001 , brown et al .",
    "the theorem has military applications as well : saucier ( 2000 ) uses it in discussion of simulating debris fragments behind armor and characterizing the penetration potential of projectiles .",
    "further , it is a useful approximation when considering particle transport in 3-d ; see glassner 1995 .",
    "the theorem also appears as a step in estimating the sphericity of fruits and of polymer beads in gels ; see e.g. houston 1957 and nussinovitch 2010 . finally , the theorem has applications in ray tracing for computer graphics ( hanrahan 2000 ) .    more speculatively , it is possible that measurements of the ratio of average projected area to surface area might offer insight on the number of dimensions in which we live .",
    "string theory suggests there may be 9 ( supersymmetric theories ) , 10 ( m - theory ) , or 25 spatial dimensions ( bosonic string theory ) ; for reviews , see kiritsis 1998 , polchinski 1998 , or schwarz 2000 .",
    "however , in string theory these extra dimensions are often constrained to be on very small scales  for instance , in kaluza - klein theory , the extra dimension must be smaller than @xmath14 cm ( yagi et al .",
    "2011 ) , and in randall - sundrum models ( 4 spatial dimensions , see randall & sundrum 1999 i and ii ) , constraints are on the order of micro ( @xmath15 ) meters ( kapner et al .",
    "2007 ) . constraining extra spatial dimensions using this theorem",
    "might also be challenging because in string theory , electromagnetic waves propagate through the usual 3 dimensions ; it is only gravitational effects that are hypothesized to propagate in extra dimensions , as this would resolve the so - called hierarchy problem by explaining why gravity is very much weaker than electromagnetism .",
    "thus , it would be necessary to find applications in which the gravitational wave emission or absorption of an object depended on its average projected area .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to give an intuitive , geometric proof of the generalization of this theorem to higher - dimensional convex solids and obtain an expression for @xmath16 in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "a second goal will be to consider and offer intuition for the limiting behavior of this ratio as a function of dimension .",
    "the plan of what follows is thus .",
    "i begin by proving the theorem in 3-d for completeness , though this result may be found be found elsewhere , e.g. in hildebrand 1942 .",
    "we then present a geometric method for computing the ratio of average projected area to surface area as a function of the dimension of the space (  7 ) , provide a table of values , and examine the limit of the ratio as the dimension becomes infinite (  8) .",
    "we conclude by presenting a simple recursion relation for the ratio between two consecutive dimensions and supplying an explicit formula for the ratio in terms of elementary operations .",
    "consider on an arbitrary convex solid an infinitesimal unit of surface area @xmath17 .",
    "define @xmath18 as the unit vector normal to the surface . now consider a sphere of unit radius centered on the solid .",
    "consider an observer at a point on this sphere s surface , and let the observer s location define a hemisphere with its apex at their location .",
    "if the vector @xmath18 points such that it intersects this hemisphere , then the observer will see it . since this hemisphere s position is uncorrelated with the direction of @xmath18 for an arbitrary unit of surface area @xmath17 , on average @xmath18 will point into the observer s hemisphere half the time .",
    "now restrict attention to the case where @xmath18 points into the observer s hemisphere .",
    "consider the projection of @xmath18 along the line of sight from the surface to the observer .",
    "denote the angle between @xmath18 and the line of sight by @xmath19 and note that because we have restricted ourselves to a hemisphere , @xmath20 runs from zero to @xmath21 .",
    "we wish to integrate @xmath22 to find its average value , as @xmath22 gives the projection of @xmath18 onto the line of sight :    @xmath23    notice that this integral is simply the differential projection of the solid s face onto the hemisphere at whose apex the observer sits , normalized by the hemisphere s surface area .    here",
    ", the intuitive picture is that the orientation of the solid s face is changing while the observer s position is held fixed . in this picture , we are in the observer s rest frame . as noted  5 , it is equivalent to consider the solid s face fixed and vary the observer s position with respect to it  i.e . to work in the solid s rest frame .",
    "the only quantity of physical significance is the relative angle between the line of sight and the oriented unit area vector @xmath18 .    recalling the additional factor of @xmath24 because @xmath18 only points into the observer s hemisphere half the time , and integrating over the solid s surface ,",
    "we find    @xmath25    with @xmath26 denoting an integral over the solid s surface and @xmath27 the solid s surface area .",
    "note that , consonant with our comments above , though we derived equation ( [ e:3dfirstint ] ) in the rest frame of the observer , working in the rest frame of the solid will prove more fruitful for generalizing the theorem to higher dimensions . for notice that , in this picture , as the observer s position varies ( at fixed distance from the origin ) , it traces out a hemisphere .",
    "hence we simply require the normalized projection of the solid s face onto this hemisphere .",
    "but since the projection operator is commutative , this is just the projection of the hemisphere onto the solid s face .",
    "this latter is simply a disc bounded by the circle produced where the hemisphere intersects the solids face .",
    "as noted in  6 , considering the rest frame of the solid s face and projecting onto the hemisphere defined by the different possible orientations of an observer at fixed distance from the origin is a fruitful way to calculate the average projected area .",
    "as also noted , this projection is easily evaluated by finding the normalized projection of the hemisphere onto the solid s face .",
    "both points also hold in arbitrary higher dimensions .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "one simply considers the hyperhemisphere generated by varying the observer s orientation ( at fixed distance from the origin ) with respect to the face of the solid under consideration , and calculates the normalized projection of the solid s hypersurface onto it .",
    "this is equal to the normalized projection of the hyperhemisphere onto the hypersurface bounding it .",
    "now , the projection of a hyperhemisphere of dimension @xmath2 onto the bounding hypersurface in @xmath2 dimensions is simply the hypersphere of dimension @xmath28 . hence    @xmath29    with @xmath30 the volume of the unit hypersphere of dimension @xmath28 and @xmath31 its surface area .",
    "the factor of @xmath24 comes from the fact that @xmath18 only points into the observer s hemisphere half the time .",
    "here , we use the observation of the previous section to derive the analog of equation ( [ e:3dsecondeq ] ) for dimensions other than 3 . as equation ( [ e : secproof ] ) shows , the differential average projected area of a @xmath2-dimensional convex solid is just the volume of the unit @xmath28-sphere normalized by double the surface area of the unit @xmath2-hemisphere .",
    "hence we seek the factor @xmath32 relating @xmath33 to @xmath6 , the surface area of the convex solid .",
    "as we will see below , it is just @xmath34 where @xmath30 is the volume of the unit @xmath28-sphere and @xmath35 is the surface area of the unit @xmath2-sphere .",
    "we have    @xmath36    where the second equality is from using equation ( [ e : secproof ] ) for @xmath37 and replacing @xmath38 with @xmath39 . the result is easily verified for 3-d : with @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "now , for a sphere ,    @xmath43    and    @xmath44    ( hypersphere , wolfram ) , where we have defined @xmath45    @xmath46    we can thus see that    @xmath47    equation ( [ e : kd ] ) is easily evaluated ; we provide a table of the first thirty - two values , as well as a plot illustrating the monotonic decrease in @xmath32 . for large @xmath2 , @xmath48 , as we show by a series expansion ( equation ( [ e : kdseries ] ) ) .",
    "this is a suggestive result , as it recalls the theorem in statistics that the standard deviation @xmath49 of a set of measurements falls as @xmath50 for @xmath51 measurements .",
    "one may make this connection explicit by considering @xmath51 identical free particles moving in 3 spatial dimensions and examining the point set defined by the tip of each particle s velocity vector . connecting this",
    "point set results in a 3 dimensional convex solid .",
    "one may now consider the area of a face of this solid . from dimensional analysis",
    ", it must be proportional to the square of the separation between the vectors corresponding to the particles whose coordinates define the face .",
    "this separation is simply @xmath49 , with @xmath49 the standard deviation of the velocity distribution from which the particles were drawn .",
    "thus the area of a face is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "now , there will be of order @xmath51 faces of the solid , so by equipartition arguments , on average the area of one face will be a fraction @xmath53 of the surface area .",
    "therefore we see that @xmath54 .",
    "this gives some intuition for the connection between the fact in statistics that @xmath55 and the fact that , in many dimensions @xmath2 , which one may interpret as describing a many ( @xmath51 ) particle system with @xmath56 , the ratio of average projected area to surface area also falls with @xmath57 .",
    ".ratio of average projected area to surface area ( @xmath32 ) as a function of dimension @xmath2 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : kd ]     with increasing @xmath2 ; to leading order @xmath58 , as equation ( [ e : kdseries ] ) indicates . ]",
    "[ f : kdbig ]    finally , it is interesting to consider the limiting behavior of @xmath32 as @xmath2 tends to infinity .",
    "as might be intuited from the plot , @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "this follows immediately from the series for @xmath32 about @xmath61 , with @xmath62 : @xmath63 this series is accurate to one part in ten thousand for @xmath2 as low as five .",
    "there exists a simple recursion relation for @xmath64 in terms of @xmath32 .",
