    "all correlations vanish , while at zero lag time the cross - correlation vanishes , implying that apparently the particle does not feel the presence of another particle at the beginning due to the mutual cancellation of collective and relative motions .",
    "the entropic force has a finite influence on both correlations .",
    "they are always anti - correlated because the first mode ( collective motion ) always decays faster than the second mode ( relative motion ) due to its less resistance .",
    "in other words , this relative motion dominates the relevance of the displacements of both particles after certain lag time , and the pair interaction behaves like in its second or anticorrelated mode .",

    "we presented a theoretical description that enables to characterize the stochastic motions of a pair of hard spheres in non - adsorbing polymer solutions .",
    "based on a two - layer approximation for the polymer depletion effect , the hydrodynamic mobility tensor is resolved by the boundary integral analysis , which determines the corresponding time evolution of stochastic displacements that are consistent with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",

    "is weakened in a way that higher viscosity slows down the motion significantly and lengthens the hydrodynamic decay time .",
