    "it is a useful and well - known fact that plane partitions in an @xmath0 box , lozenge tilings of a hexagon with side lengths @xmath1 , families of non - intersecting lattice path in such a hexagon , and perfect matchings of a suitable honeycomb graph are all in bijection . in this work",
    "we refine the latter three bijections by establishing signed versions of them for regions that are more general than hexagons .",
    "more specifically , we consider certain subregions of a triangular region @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is an equilateral triangle of side length @xmath3 subdivided by equilateral triangles of side length one .",
    "we view a hexagon with side lengths @xmath4 as the region obtained by removing triangles of side lengths @xmath5 , and @xmath6 at the vertices of @xmath2 , where @xmath7 .",
    "more generally , we consider subregions @xmath8 ( for some @xmath3 ) that arise from @xmath9 by removing upward - pointing triangles , each of them being a union of unit triangles .",
    "we refer to the removed upward - pointing triangles as _ punctures_. the punctures may overlap ( see figure [ fig : triregion - intro ] ) .",
    "we call the resulting subregions of @xmath9 _ triangular subregions_. such a region is said to be _ balanced _ if it contains as many upward - pointing unit triangles as down - pointing pointing unit triangles .",
    "for example , hexagonal subregions are balanced .",
    "lozenge tilings of triangular subregions have been studied in several areas .",
    "for example , they are used in statistical mechanics for modeling bonds in dimers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or in statistical mechanics when studying phase transitions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .     lozenge tilings . ]     lozenge tilings . ]    for an arbitrary triangular region , the bijection between lozenge tilings and plane partitions breaks down . however , there are still bijections between lozenge tilings , perfect matchings , and families of lattice paths . here",
    "we establish a signed version of these bijections .",
    "in particular , we show that , for each balanced triangular region @xmath10 , there is a bijection between the signed perfect matchings and the signed families of non - intersecting lattice paths .",
    "this is achieved via the links to lozenge tilings .",
    "+ _ a perfect matching . _     + _ a family of non - intersecting lattice paths . _",
    "indeed , the perfect matchings determined by any triangular region @xmath10 can be enumerated by the permanent of a zero - one matrix @xmath11 that is the bi - adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph .",
    "this suggests to introduce the sign of a perfect matching such that the signed perfect matchings are enumerated by the determinant of @xmath11 .",
    "we call this sign the _ perfect matching sign _ of the lozenge tiling that corresponds to the perfect matching ( see definition [ def : pm - sign ] ) .    using the theory pioneered by gessel and viennot @xcite , lindstrm @xcite , stembridge @xcite , and krattenthaler @xcite ,",
    "the sets of signed families of non - intersecting lattice paths in @xmath10 can be enumerated by the determinant of a matrix @xmath12 whose entries are binomial coefficients .",
    "we define the sign used in this enumeration as the _ lattice path sign _ of the corresponding lozenge tiling of the region @xmath10 ( see definition [ def : nilp - sign ] ) .",
    "typically , the matrix @xmath12 is much smaller than the matrix @xmath11 .",
    "however , the entries of @xmath12 can be much bigger than one .    in order to compare enumerations of",
    "signed perfect matchings and signed lattice paths we introduce a new combinatorial construction that we call _ resolution of a puncture_. roughly speaking , it replaces a triangular subregion with a fixed lozenge tiling by a larger triangular subregion with a compatible lozenge tiling and one puncture less . carefully analyzing the change of sign under resolutions of punctures and using induction on the number of punctures of a given region , we establish that , for each balanced triangular subregion , the perfect matching sign and the lattice path sign are in fact equivalent , and",
    "thus ( see theorem [ thm : detzn ] ) @xmath13 the proof also reveals instances where the absolute value of @xmath14 is equal to the permanent of @xmath11 .",
    "this includes hexagonal regions , for which the result is well - known .",
    "the results of this paper will be used in forthcoming work @xcite in order to study the so - called weak lefschetz property @xcite of monomial ideals .",
    "the latter is an algebraic property that has important connections to combinatorics .",
    "for example , it has been used for establishing unimodality results and the g - theorem on the face vectors of simplicial polytopes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : trireg ] , we introduce triangular regions and establish a criterion for the tileability of such a region . in section  [ sec : signed ] , we introduce the perfect matching and lattice path signs for a lozenge tiling .",
    "section  [ sec : resolution ] contains our main results .",
    "there we introduce the method of resolving a puncture and use it to prove the equivalence of the two signs .",
    "in this section , we introduce a generalization of hexagonal regions , which we call triangular regions , and we investigate the tileability of such regions .",

    "then the lattice path signs of @xmath54 and the twist of @xmath99 in @xmath54 are the same if and only if the @xmath121-count of @xmath99 is even .        if @xmath253 , then every tiling of @xmath10 induces the same bijection @xmath254 .",
    "thus , all tilings have the same lattice path sign .",
    "since @xmath10 has no floating punctures , @xmath99 has an @xmath121-count of zero .",
    "hence , the claim is true if @xmath255 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath257 , and choose @xmath156 among the floating punctures and the minimal covering regions of two overlapping floating punctures of @xmath10 as the one that covers the upward - pointing unit triangle of @xmath2 with the smallest monomial label .",

    "no other floating punctures are to the lower - right of @xmath156 .",
    "it follows that no edge on the lower - right chain crosses a lattice path , except possibly at the end of the lattice path .    for the resolution of @xmath156 relative to @xmath259 , use the splitting chains described in the previous paragraph , except for the edges that cross the lozenge cycle @xmath99 .",
    "they have to be adjusted since these unit edges disappear when twisting @xmath99 .",
    "we replace each such unit edge by a unit edge in an acceptable direction followed by a unit edge in a preferred direction so that the result has the same starting and end point as the unit edge they replace . note",
    "that this is always possible and that this determines the replacement uniquely .",
    "the new chains meet the requirements on splitting chains .    using these splitting chains",

    "denote by @xmath215 the extension of the cycle @xmath99 in @xmath60 ( see lemma  [ lem : cycle - res ] ) .",
    "since @xmath54 and @xmath259 differ exactly on the cycle @xmath99 and the splitting chains were chosen to be the same except on @xmath99 , it follows that twisting @xmath215 in @xmath191 results in the tiling @xmath264 of @xmath60 .",
    "first , we compare the starting and end points of lattice paths in @xmath10 and @xmath60 .",
    "resolution of the puncture identifies each starting and end point in @xmath10 with one such point in @xmath60 .",
    "we refer to these points as the _ old _ starting and end points in @xmath60 .",
    "note that the end points on the puncture @xmath156 correspond to the end points on the puncture in the southeast corner of @xmath60 .",
    "the starting points in @xmath10 that are on one of the splitting chains used for resolving @xmath156 relative to @xmath54 and @xmath259 are the same .",
    "assume there are @xmath269 such points .",
    "after resolution , each point gives rise to a new starting and end point in @xmath60 .",
    "both are connected by a lattice path that is the same in both resolutions of @xmath156 .",
    "hence , in order to compare the signs of the permutations @xmath267 and @xmath268 on @xmath270 letters , it is enough to compare the lattice paths between the old starting and end points in both resolutions .",
    "retain for these points the original labels used in @xmath10 . using this labeling ,",
    "the lattice paths induce permutations @xmath271 and @xmath272 on @xmath131 letters . again , this is the same process in both resolutions .",
    "it follows that @xmath273    assume now that @xmath156 is a puncture",
    ". then the end points on @xmath156 are indexed by @xmath274 consecutive integers .",
    "since we retain the labels , the same indices label the end points on the puncture in the southeast corner of @xmath60 .",
    "the end points on @xmath156 correspond to the points in @xmath60 whose labels are obtained by multiplying by @xmath275 .",
    "consider now the case , where all edges in the lower - right splitting chain in @xmath10 are in preferred directions .",
    "then the lattice paths induced by @xmath191 connect each point in @xmath60 that corresponds to an end point on @xmath156 to the end point in the southeast corner of @xmath60 with the same index .",
    "thus , @xmath276 .",
    "next , assume that there is exactly one edge in acceptable direction on the lower - right splitting chain of @xmath10 .",
    "if this direction is northeast , then the @xmath274 lattice paths passing through the points in @xmath60 corresponding to the end points on @xmath156 are moved one unit to the north . if the acceptable direction was southwest , then the edge in this direction leads to a shift of these paths by one unit to the south . in either case",
    ", this shift means that the paths in @xmath10 and @xmath60 connect to end points that differ by @xmath274 transpositions , so @xmath277 . more generally ,",
    "if @xmath222 is the number of unit edges on the lower - right splitting chain of @xmath10 that are in acceptable directions , then @xmath278    next , denote by @xmath6 the number of unit edges on the lower - right splitting chain that have to be adjusted when twisting @xmath99 . since each of these edges is replaced by an edge in a preferred and one edge in an acceptable direction , after twisting the lower - right splitting chain in @xmath10",
    "has exactly @xmath279 unit edges in acceptable directions .",
    "it follows as above that @xmath280 since a unit edge on the splitting chain has to be adjusted when twisting if and only if it is shared by two consecutive lozenges in the cycle @xmath99 , the number @xmath6 is even if and only if the puncture @xmath156 is outside @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , as the puncture @xmath156 has been resolved in @xmath60 , we conclude by induction that @xmath191 and @xmath264 have the same lattice path sign if and only if the @xmath121-count of @xmath215 is even .",
    "thus , we get @xmath281        1 .",
    "suppose @xmath156 is inside @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath6 is odd .",
    "hence , the above considerations imply @xmath283 as desired .",
    "2 .   suppose @xmath156 is outside of @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath6 is even , and we conclude @xmath284    finally , it remains to consider the case where @xmath156 is the minimal covering region of two overlapping punctures of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath285 be the triangular region that differs from @xmath10 only by having @xmath156 as a puncture , and let @xmath286 and @xmath287 be the tilings of @xmath285 induced by @xmath54 and @xmath259 , respectively . since we order the end points of lattice paths using monomial labels , it is possible that the indices of the end points on the northeast boundary of @xmath156 in @xmath288 differ from those of the points on the northeast boundary of the overlapping punctures in @xmath10 .",
    "however , the lattice paths induced by @xmath54 and @xmath259 connecting the points on the northeast boundary of @xmath156 to the points on the northeast boundary of the overlapping punctures are the same .",
    "hence the lattice paths sign of @xmath54 and @xmath286 differ in the same ways as the signs of @xmath259 and @xmath287 .",
    "since we have shown our assertion for @xmath286 and @xmath287 , it also follows for @xmath54 and @xmath259 .",
    "[ cor : lpsgn - cycle ] let @xmath61 be a non - empty , balanced triangular region .",
    "then two tilings of @xmath10 have the same lattice path sign if and only if the sum of the @xmath121-counts ( which may count some end points @xmath211 multiple times ) of the difference cycles is even .",
    "suppose two tilings @xmath223 and @xmath224 of @xmath10 have difference cycles @xmath248 .",
    "by lemma  [ lem : lpsgn - cycle ] , @xmath289 if and only if an even number of the @xmath250 have an odd @xmath121-count .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the sum of the @xmath121-counts of @xmath248 being even .",
    "our above results imply that the two signs that we assigned to a given lozenge tiling , the perfect matching sign ( see definition  [ def : pm - sign ] ) and the lattice path sign ( see definition  [ def : nilp - sign ] ) , are the same up to a scaling factor depending only on @xmath10 .",
    "the main result of this section follows now easily .      1 .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath191 be two lozenge tilings of @xmath10 .",

    ", it follows that @xmath292 .",
    "theorem [ thm : detzn ] allows us to move freely between the points of view using lozenge tilings , perfect matchings , and families of non - intersecting lattice paths , as needed .",
    "in particular , it implies that rotating a triangular region by @xmath49 or @xmath146 does not change the enumerations .",
    "thus , for example , the three matrices described in remark  [ rem : rotations ] as well as the matrix given in example  [ exa : z - matrix ] all have the same determinant , up to sign .",
    "we exhibit triangular regions such that all lozenge tilings have the same sign , that is , the signed and the unsigned enumerations are the same .",
    "this is guaranteed to happen if all floating punctures ( see the definition preceding lemma  [ lem : lpsgn - cycle ] ) have an even side length .",
    "[ cor : same - sign ] let @xmath10 be a tileable triangular region , and suppose all floating punctures of @xmath10 have an even side length .",
    "then every lozenge tiling of @xmath10 has the same perfect matching sign as well as the same lattice path sign , and so @xmath293 .",
    "the equality of the perfect matching signs follows from corollary  [ cor : msgn - cycle ] , and the equality of the lattice path signs from corollary  [ cor : lpsgn - cycle ] .",
    "now theorem  [ thm : pm - matrix ] implies @xmath293 .",
    "the above corollary vastly extends ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.2 ) , where hexagons are considered , using a different approach .",
    "this special case was also established independently in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.4 ) , with essentially the same proof as  @xcite .",
    "corollary  [ cor : same - sign ] can also be derived from kasteleyn s theorem on enumerating perfect matchings  @xcite . to see this",
    ", notice that in the case , where all floating punctures have even side lengths , all `` faces '' of the bipartite graph @xmath83 have size congruent to @xmath294 .",
    "we now extend corollary  [ cor : same - sign ] . to this end",
    "we define the _ shadow _ of a puncture to be the region of @xmath10 that is both below the puncture and to the right of the line extending from the upper - right edge of the puncture .",
    "see figure  [ fig : puncture - shadow ] .",
    "[ cor : same - sign - shadow ] let @xmath61 be a balanced triangular region .",
    "if all floating punctures ( and minimal covering regions of overlapping punctures ) with other punctures in their shadows have even side length , then any two lozenge tilings of @xmath10 have the same perfect matching and the same lattice path sign .",
    "thus , @xmath293 .",
    "let @xmath156 be a floating puncture or a minimal covering region with no punctures in its shadow .",
    "then the shadow of @xmath156 is uniquely tileable , and thus the lozenges in the shadow are fixed in each lozenge tiling of @xmath10 .",
    "hence , no cycle of lozenges in any tiling of @xmath10 can contain @xmath156 . using corollary  [ cor : msgn - cycle ] and corollary  [ cor : lpsgn - cycle ]",
    ", we see that @xmath156 does not affect the sign of the tilings of @xmath10 .",
    "now our assumptions imply that all floating punctures ( or minimal covering regions of overlapping punctures ) of @xmath10 that can be contained in a difference cycle of two lozenge tilings of @xmath10 have even side length .",
