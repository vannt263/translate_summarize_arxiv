    "the ground state of such model on a _ kagom _ lattice ( fig .",
    "1 ) is known to have a huge accidental ( that is not related to the symmetry of the hamiltonian ) degeneracy @xcite .",
    "for @xmath2 the minimum of the energy of each triangular plaquette is achieved when the three spins belonging to it form the angles @xmath5 with each other .",
    "in addition to the possibility of a simultaneous rotation of all three spins such arrangement is also characterized by the two - fold discrete degeneracy .",
    "when on going clockwise around the plaquette the spins rotate clockwise ( anticlockwise ) , the plaquette can be ascribed the positive ( negative ) chirality @xmath6 . in the ground state of the antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model with triangular lattice",

    "@xmath3 analogously acquire only three values which differ from each other by @xmath7 .",
    "however , the requirements for the arrangement of chiralities are less rigid than on triangular lattice and accordingly the ground state in addition to the continuous @xmath8 degeneracy ( related with an arbitrary simultaneous rotation of all spins ) is characterized by a well developed discrete degeneracy ( of the same type as in the 3-state antiferromagnetic potts model ) leading to a finite residual entropy per site @xcite .",
    "the accidental degeneracy persists if the interaction function in eq .",

    "this state has the same structure as the ground state of a planar antiferromagnet with triangular lattice ( or , to put it more accurately , can be obtained by the natural truncation of it ) .",

    "is reduced to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possibility of the two phase transitions , one of which is associated with unbinding of vortex pairs [ the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition @xcite ] and the other with proliferation of the ising type domain walls .",
    "the number of the systems with the same degeneracy of the ground state includes , in particular , the antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model with triangular lattice @xcite and the fully frustrated @xmath0 model with square lattice @xcite .    for the case of weak nnn interactin ( @xmath17 )",
    "the energy of a domain wall ( per unit length ) is proportional to @xmath18 and the logarithmical interaction of vortices to @xmath19 .",
    "if domain walls and vortices were completely independent one would then expect the phase transition related with breaking of the discrete symmetry group to take place at lower temperature than the bkt transition .    in the present work we analyse the mutual influence between different classes of topological excitations in the antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model with a _ kagom _ lattice and weak nnn interaction and demostrate that the phase transition related with the domain walls proliferation ( i ) can happen as a separate phase transition only for extremely weak nnn interaction , ( ii ) is not of the ising type and ( iii ) the temperature of this transition is _ not _ proportional to the strength of the nnn interaction as one could naively expect .",
    "we also show that at very low temperatures the free energy of spin waves leads to stabilization of the antiferromagnetic ordering of chiralities even in absence of the nnn interaction .",

    "the role of @xmath3 is played by the phase of the superconducting order parameter , and equivalence with the antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model is achieved when the magnitude of the magnetic field corresponds to half - integer number of superconducting flux quanta per each triangular plaquette .",
    "a superconducting array , which can be described by the same model in absence of the external magnetic field , can be constructed with the help of so - called @xmath24-junctions @xcite .",

    "when crossing the first segment the state to the right of the wall should be obtained from the state to the left by the permutation of a and b , whereas for the second segment the state to the right should be obtained by the permutation of a and c. this introduces the descrepancy of @xmath7 which can be localized on a semi - infinite line terminating at the special point ( for example on the line x - y - z ) . in order to locally minimize the energy x , y and z",

    "such conclusion , implicitely based on the comparison of the energy of an infinite domain wall with the negative entropic contribution to its free energy ( the peierls argument @xcite ) , does not take into account that the presence of an infinite domain wall leads also to supression of the entropy ( because it decreases the possibilities for formation of closed domain wall loops ) and in some cases does not work .    in sec .",
