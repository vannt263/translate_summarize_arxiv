    "the original schwarz method , proposed and analyzed by hermann schwarz in 1870 @xcite , is an iterative method to find the solution of a partial differential equation ( pde ) on a complicated domain which is the union of two overlapping simpler subdomains .",
    "the method solves the equation on each of the two subdomains by using the latest values of the approximate solution as the boundary conditions on the parts of the subdomain boundaries which are inside of the given domain .",
    "the idea of splitting a given problem posed on a large ( and possibly complicated ) domain into several subproblems posed on smaller subdomains and then solving the subdomain problems either sequentially or in parallel is a very appealing idea .",
    "divide - and - conquer \" idea is at the heart of every domain decomposition or schwarz method .",
    "it is well - known that @xcite the domain decomposition strategy can be introduced at the following three different levels : the continuous level for pde analysis as proposed and analyzed by hermann schwarz in 1870 , the discretization level for constructing ( hybrid and composite ) discretization methods , and the algebraic level for solving algebraic systems arising from the numerical approximations of pde problems .",
    "these three levels are often interconnected , and each of them has its own merit to be studied .",
    "most of the recent efforts and attentions have been focused on the algebraic level .",
    "the field of domain decomposition methods has blossomed and undergone intensive and phenomenal development during the last thirty years ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the phenomenal development has largely been driven by the ever increasing demands for fast solvers for solving important and complicated scientific , engineering and industrial application problems which are often governed mathematically by a pde or a system of pdes .",
    "it has also been infused and facilitated by the rapid advances in computer hardware and the emergence of parallel computing technologies .    at the algebraic level , domain decomposition methods or schwarz methods have been well developed and studied for various numerical approximations ( discretizations ) of many types of pde problems including finite element methods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , mixed finite element methods and spectral methods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and discontinuous galerkin methods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . a general abstract framework , backed by an elegant convergence theory ,",
    "was well established many years ago for symmetric and positive definite ( spd ) pde problems and their numerical approximations ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .    despite the tremendous advances in domain decomposition ( schwarz ) methods over the past thirty years , the current framework and convergence theory",
    "are mainly confined to spd problems in hilbert spaces .",
    "because the framework and especially the convergence theory indispensably rely on the spd properties of the underlying problem and the hilbert space structures , they do not apply to genuinely nonsymmetric and/or indefinite problems . as a result ,",
    "the spd framework and theory leave many important and interesting problems uncovered as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this paper attempts to address this important issue in schwarz methods .",
    "the goal of this paper is to introduce a new schwarz framework and theory , based on the well - known idea of space decomposition as in the spd case , for nonsymmetric and indefinite linear systems arising from continuous and discontinuous galerkin approximations of general nonsymmetric and indefinite elliptic partial differential equations under some  minimum \" structure assumptions . unlike the spd framework and theory , our new framework and theory are presented in a variational setting in banach spaces instead of hilbert spaces .",
    "such a general framework allows broader applications of schwarz methods .",
    "both additive schwarz and multiplicative as weel as hybrid schwarz methods are developed .",
    "a comprehensive convergence theory is provided which includes condition number estimates for the additive schwarz preconditioners and hybrid schwarz preconditioners .",
    "the main idea of our nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz framework and theory is to use weak coercivity ( satisfied by the nonsymmetric and indefinite bilinear form ) induced norms to replace the standard bilinear form induced norm in the spd schwarz framework and theory ( see sections [ sec-2][sec-4 ] for a detailed exposition ) . as expected , working with such weak coercivity induced norms and nonsymmetric and indefinite bilinear forms is quite delicate .",
    "it requires new and different technical tools in order to establish our convergence theory .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized in the following way . in section [ sec-2 ] ,",
    "we introduce notation , the functional setting , and the variational problems which we aim to solve .",
    "section 2 also contains some further discussions on the main idea of the paper .",
    "section [ sec-3 ] is devoted to establishing an abstract additive schwarz , multiplicative schwarz , and hybrid schwarz framework for general nonsymmetric and indefinite algebraic problems in a variational setting in general banach spaces . in section [ sec-4 ] ,",
    "we present an abstract convergence theory for the additive and hybrid schwarz methods proposed in section [ sec-3 ] . in section [ sec-5 ] , we present some applications of the proposed nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz framework to discontinuous galerkin approximations of convection - diffusion ( in particular , convection - dominated ) problems .",
    "we also provide extensive 1-d numerical experiments to gauge the performance of the proposed nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz methods .",

    "let @xmath3 be two reflexive banach spaces endowed with the norms @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "let @xmath6 be a real bilinear form defined on the product space @xmath7 and @xmath8 be a real linear functional defined on @xmath9 .",
    "we consider the following variational problem : find @xmath10 such that @xmath11 the well - posedness of the above variational problem has been extensively studied .",

    "\\(b ) as pointed out in @xcite , condition can be replaced by the following more restrictive condition : there exists a constant @xmath15 such that @xmath16 the above condition can be viewed as a _ weak coercivity _ condition for the adjoint bilinear form @xmath17 of @xmath6 .",
    "( c ) weak coercivity condition is often called the _ inf - sup _ or _ babuka  brezzi _",

    "( e ) there are also situations where one prefers to use different norms for the trial space @xmath19 and the test space @xmath9 even if @xmath18 .",
    "theorem [ babuska ] also provides a convenient framework to handle such a situation .      as problem is posed on infinite dimensional spaces @xmath19 and @xmath9 , to solve it numerically , one must approximate @xmath19 and @xmath9 by some finite dimensional spaces @xmath20 . here",

    "in addition , if @xmath23 is not a subspace of @xmath9 one also needs to provide an approximate linear functional @xmath26 for @xmath8 so that @xmath26 is well defined on @xmath23 .",

    "when @xmath37 it is well known that @xcite @xmath36 is symmetric if and only if @xmath24 is symmetric and @xmath36 is positive definite provided that @xmath24 is strongly coercive on @xmath38 . in general , @xmath36 is just an @xmath39 nonsymmetric real matrix if @xmath24 is not symmetric . @xmath36 also can be indefinite ( i.e. , @xmath36 has at least one negative and one positive eigenvalue ) if @xmath24 fails to be coercive .    as is a square linear system , by a well - known algebraic fact we know that has a unique solution @xmath40 provided that the stiffness matrix @xmath36 is nonsingular .",
    "this nonsingular condition on @xmath36 becomes necessary if one wants to be uniquely solvable for _ arbitrary _ vector @xmath41 . for most application problems ( such as boundary value problems for elliptic pdes )",

    "\\(d ) theorem [ discrete_babuska ] focuses on the unique solvability and the stability of the numerical method not on the accuracy of the method .",
    "we like to note that method indeed is an accurate numerical method provided that approximate spaces @xmath22 and @xmath23 are accurate approximations of @xmath19 and @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .      as we briefly explained above , approximating the variational problem by a galerkin method certainly results in solving the linear system .",
    "it is well known that the common dimension @xmath47 of the approximation spaces @xmath22 and @xmath23 has to be sufficiently large in order for the galerkin method to be accurate . as a result",
    ", the size of the linear system ( i.e. , the size of the matrix @xmath36 ) is expected to be very large in applications . moreover ,",

    "consequently , it is not efficient to solve linear system directly using classical iterative methods even if they converge .",
    "furthermore , unlike in the spd case , classical iterative methods often do not converge for general nonsymmetric and indefinite linear system ( cf .",

    "the focus of this paper is exactly what is described above .",
    "our goal is to develop a new schwarz framework and theory , based on the well - known idea of space decomposition , for solving nonsymmetric and indefinite linear system which arises from the galerkin method as an approximation of the variational problem .",
    "as expected , our nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz framework and theory are natural extensions of the well - known spd schwarz framework and theory which were nicely described in @xcite .",
    "for the sake of notational brevity , throughout the remainder of this paper we shall suppress the sub - index @xmath47 in the discrete spaces @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 and in discrete functions @xmath34 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in other words , @xmath19 and @xmath9 are used to denote @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are used to denote @xmath34 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , we shall make an effort below to use the same or similar terminologies , as well as space and norm notation as those in @xcite for the symmetric and positive definite ( spd ) schwarz framework and theory .",
    "we shall also make comments about notation and terminologies which have no spd counterparts and try to make links between the well known spd schwarz framework and theory and our nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz framework and theory .    to motivate , we recall that in the spd schwarz framework and theory @xcite , since @xmath18 and the discrete bilinear form @xmath24 is symmetric and strongly coercive , @xmath62 defines a convenient norm ( which is also equivalent to the @xmath63-norm ) on the space @xmath19 ( as well as on its subspaces ) .",
    "this bilinear form induced norm plays a vital role in the spd schwarz framework and theory .",
    "unfortunately , without the symmetry and strong coercivity assumptions on @xmath24 , @xmath62 is not a norm anymore when @xmath18 .",
    "it is not even well defined if @xmath64 ! to overcome this difficulty , the existing nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz framework and theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which only deal with the case @xmath18 , assume that @xmath24 has a decomposition @xmath65 where @xmath66 is assumed to be symmetric and strongly coercive ( i.e. , it is spd ) and @xmath67 is a perturbation of @xmath66 . in this",
    "setting @xmath66 then induces an equivalent ( to @xmath63 ) norm @xmath68 and one then works with this norm as in the spd case .",
    "unfortunately and understandably , such a setting requires that @xmath67 is a _ small _ perturbation of @xmath66 , which is why the existing nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz framework and theory only apply to  nearly \" spd problems .",
    "hence , it leaves more interesting and more difficult nonsymmetric and indefinite problems unresolved .      to develop a new schwarz framework and theory for general nonsymmetric and indefinite problems ,",
    "our only assumptions on the discrete problem are those stated in the well - posedness theorem [ discrete_babuska ] .",
    "we now restate those assumptions on the discrete bilinear form @xmath24 and its adjoint @xmath46 using the new function and space notation ( i.e. , after suppressing the sub - index @xmath47 ) as follows :    * main assumptions *    * _ continuity _ there exists a positive constant @xmath69 such that @xmath70 , @xmath71 such that @xmath72    [ rem3.1 ] ( a ) since @xmath73 , then the continuity condition is equivalent to @xmath74    \\(b ) assumptions ( ma@xmath75 ) and ( ma@xmath76 ) impose some restrictions on the underlying galerkin method .",
    "but as we noted in remark [ rem2.2 ] , these are some  minimum \" conditions for the galerkin method to be practically useful . from that point of view , ( ma@xmath75 ) and ( ma@xmath76 ) are not restrictions at all .    as it was pointed out in the previous subsection , for a general nonsymmetric and indefinite problem , since the discrete bilinear form @xmath24 is not strongly coercive , then @xmath77 is not a norm anymore .",
    "in fact , @xmath77 may not even be defined if @xmath64 .",
    "so a crucial question is what norms ( if any ) would @xmath24 induce on @xmath19 and @xmath9 which are equivalent to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath24 does induce equivalent norms on both @xmath19 and @xmath9 , and these norms are hidden in the weak coercivity conditions and ! this key observation leads to the main idea of this paper ; that is , we define the following weak coercivity induced norms : @xmath78    assumptions ( ma@xmath75 ) and ( ma@xmath76 ) immediately infer the following norm equivalence result .",
    "since its proof is trivial , we omit it .",
    "[ lem3.1 ] the following inequalities hold : @xmath79    we conclude this subsection by noting that the variational setting laid out so far is a banach space setting .",
    "no hilbert space structure is required for the space @xmath19 and @xmath9 .",
    "this is not only mathematically interesting but also practically valuable because for some pde application problems it is imperative to work in a banach space setting",
    ". we also note that if @xmath18 and @xmath24 is spd ( i.e. , it is symmetric and strongly coercive ) , then @xmath80 .",
    "hence , we recover the standard bilinear form induced norm !      it is well known @xcite that schwarz domain decomposition methods can be presented abstractly in the framework of the space decomposition method . in particular , the physical domain decomposition provides a practical and effective way to construct the required space decomposition and local solvers in the method . to some extent ,",
    "the space decomposition method to the schwarz domain decomposition method is what the lu factorization is to the classical gaussian elimination method .    like in the spd schwarz framework",
    "@xcite ) , there are two essential ingredients in our nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz framework , namely , ( i ) _ construction of a pair of  compatible \" space decompositions for @xmath19 and @xmath9 _ and ( ii ) _ construction of a local solver ( or local discrete bilinear form ) on each pair of local spaces_. however , there is an obvious and crucial difference between the spd schwarz framework and our nonsymmetric and indefinite schwarz framework . when @xmath64 , our framework requires space decompositions for both spaces @xmath19 and @xmath9 , and these two space decompositions must be chosen compatibly in the sense to be described below",
    "let @xmath81 be two sets of reflexive banach spaces with norms @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are used to denote the so - called _ coarse spaces _ in the domain decomposition context . for @xmath86 ,",

    "@xcite ) , @xmath88 is often used to denote both the prolongation operator from @xmath89 to @xmath19 and its matrix representation .",
    "such a choice of notation is due to the fact that the matrix representation of the _ not - explicitly - defined _ restriction operator @xmath90 from @xmath19 to @xmath89 is always chosen to be the transpose of the matrix representation of the prolongation operator . as expected , such a dual role notation may be confusing to some readers . to avoid such a potential confusion",
    "we use different notations for operators and their matrix representations throughout this paper .",
    "we also like to note that in the construction of all schwarz methods the restriction operators / matrices are not  primary \" operators / matrices but  derivative \" operators / matrices in the sense that they are not chosen independently .",
    "instead , they are determined by the prolongation operators / matrices .",
    "one often first defines the matrix representation of the ( desired ) restriction operator as the transpose of the the matrix representation of the prolongation operator and then defines the restriction operator to be the unique linear operator which has the chosen matrix representation ( under the same bases in which the prolongation matrix is obtained ) .",
    "this will also be the approach adopted in this paper for defining our restriction operators ( see definition [ def3.2 ] ) .",
    "clearly , such a definition of the restriction operators is not only abstract but also depends on the choices of the bases of the underlying function spaces .",
    "however , its simplicity and convenience at the matrix level , which are what really matter in practice , make the definition appealing and favorable so far .",

    "depend on the number of subdomains @xmath252 . particularly in * test 2 *",
    ", we see an example that exhibits approximate linear dependence",
    ". see figure [ fig6.1 ] .",
    "4 .   for @xmath406 we do not observe such a strong dependence on the number of subdomains @xmath252 .",
    "5 .   in these tests",
    "@xmath406 is greater than @xmath191 ; thus , we can not rely upon this as an indicator for convergence of the multiplicative schwarz iterative method .",
    "@xmath410 is not a unique metric in judging the convergence of gmres after preconditioning with @xmath411 and @xmath412 .",
    "for instance , in * test 4 * @xmath405 decreases while the number of iterations necessary for gmres increases as @xmath252 increases .",
    "this is opposite of the behavior that is observed in the previous tests .",
    "our numerical experiments verify that @xmath410 is not a unique metric for the convergence of gmres .",
    "therefore , we must rely on other metrics to predict the convergence behavior of gmres .",
    "the following theorem is used in @xcite to test convergence of gmres after schwarz preconditioning in the indefinite case :    [ thm6.1 ] consider the linear system @xmath413 where @xmath414 and @xmath415 .",
    "if the symmetric part of @xmath36 is positive definite , then after @xmath416 step of gmres , the norm of the residual @xmath417 is bounded by @xmath418 where @xmath419 is the minimal eigenvalue of the symmetric part of @xmath36 and @xmath420 is the operator norm of @xmath36 given by @xmath421    unfortunately , this theorem can not be applied in our case because we are not guaranteed that @xmath411 and @xmath412 have positive definite symmetric part ( i.e. , @xmath419 ) . in the tests",
    "previously done , we find that these operators can be indefinite ( i.e. , @xmath422 ) .",
    "another result that could be of help in this area is the following theorem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    [ thm6.2 ]",
    "consider the linear system @xmath413 where @xmath414 and @xmath415 .",
    "further suppose that @xmath36 is diagonalizable . then after @xmath416 steps of gmres , the residual @xmath423 satisfies @xmath424 where @xmath19 is a nonsingular matrix of eigenvectors of @xmath36 and @xmath425 denotes the spectrum of @xmath36 .",
    "the above theorem says that the spread of the spectrum is a metric to judge the performance of gmres with gmres performing better when the spectrum of @xmath36 is clustered . with this theorem in mind ,",
    "let us examine the spectrum of the matrix @xmath36 and @xmath411 for @xmath404 obtained in * test 2 * and * test 4*.    note that in figure [ fig6.2](a ) and figure [ fig6.3](a ) the spectrum has a large spread which is consistent with the fact that gmres performed poorly on the original system without preconditioning .",
    "we also see that after preconditioning , the spectrum of @xmath411 is clustered which corresponds to improved performance of gmres after preconditioning with @xmath411 .",
    "lastly , we note that as the number of subdomains @xmath252 increases , the spread of the spectrum of @xmath411 increases .",
    "this corresponds to a decreased performance in gmres after preconditioning with @xmath411 as @xmath252 increases .",
    "this result leads us to believe that to accurately judge the behavior of gmres after preconditioning one needs to analyze the spectrum of the preconditioned system .",
    "similarly , we find that to accurately predict the performance of the multiplicative schwarz iterative method one needs to analyze the spectral radius of @xmath426 .",
    "another property of @xmath405 that is of interest is its dependence on the fine mesh parameter @xmath427 and the coarse mesh parameter @xmath428 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath429 using two - level non - overlapping domain decomposition for an ipdg approximation of the equation with @xmath430 and @xmath431 .",
    "this work uses the existing framework that is laid down for the symmetric and positive definite case .",
    "we would like to test our new framework to see if this dependence on @xmath428 and @xmath427 is still true .",
    "for this reason in * test 1 - 4 * we have calculated @xmath405 with @xmath432 and @xmath433 when @xmath434 .",
    "we also calculated @xmath405 with @xmath435 and @xmath436 when @xmath437 . from table [ table 5.5 ] and table [ table5.6 ]",
    "it seems that we can not expect @xmath429 but instead we might expect the dependence to be one of the type @xmath438 where @xmath439 and @xmath440 are positive real numbers with @xmath441 or some other more complicated dependence on @xmath428 and @xmath427 .",
