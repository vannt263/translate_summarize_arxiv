    "studies of external galaxies , in particular , recent studies of the large and small magellanic clouds , indicate large populations of shells and supershells , which dominate the structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( staveley - smith et  al .",
    "1997 ; kim et  al .",
    "1998 ) . by injecting large quantities of energy into the ism",
    ", these shells reshape galaxies on size scales of tens to hundreds of parsecs and trigger new star formation . in our own galaxy , surveys have found many small shells and `` worms '' , ( eg . heiles 1979 , 1984 ; koo , heiles , & reach 1992 ( khr ) ) but the number of large supershells and chimneys which have been identified is still relatively small ( normandeau , taylor , & dewdney 1996 ; heiles 1998 ) .",
    "these exceptionally large structures are most often identified as dramatic voids in the galactic neutral hydrogen , observed with the hi  line at 1420 mhz .",
    "unfortunately , in the inner galaxy , where they are most likely to occur , they prove difficult to detect due to distance ambiguities . as a result ,",
    "our knowledge of how dramatically the galaxy has been shaped by shells is limited .",
    "these hi  voids range in size from tens of parsecs to kiloparsecs , and are found with a variety of morphologies from nearly spherical to chimney - like .",
    "the dominant paradigm suggests that these structures are caused by the combined pressures of stellar winds and sequential supernovae ( sne ) in ob associations ( heiles 1984 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested , however , that the largest of these structures , with energies in excess of @xmath5 ergs , may be caused by impacts of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) with the galactic disk ( cf .",
    "heiles 1984 for a discussion of both formation methods ) , or more recently , that they are the remnants of hypernovae and/or gamma ray bursts ( loeb & perna 1998 ) .",
    "younger supershells are often associated with some ionized emission in the shell interior in the form of hot x - ray emitting gas , or an h@xmath6 emitting inter - rim ( points et  al .",
    "for the oldest supershells it is likely that the hot x - ray emitting medium has diffused and the massive stars of the ob association have expired , leaving only a evacuated region in the galactic hi . for the largest , and therefore the oldest , of these shells , expansion can exceed the scale height of the hilayer of the galaxy .",
    "such expansion will elongate along the axis perpendicular to the galactic plane , as predicted by theories of expansion into a stratified medium ( eg .",
    "kompaneets 1960 ) . in this case",
    "we expect to see chimneys where the polar regions of the shell become rayleigh - taylor unstable and break through into the galactic halo , providing a source of ionized hydrogen and thermal support for the halo .",
    "the galactic plane near @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9  ( lsr ) is a dynamic place , with very dramatic brightness temperature fluctuations over relatively small scales , and the edge of the carina arm .",
    "positive velocities in this direction are beyond the solar circle , corresponding to a unique distance . as a result",
    ", it is somewhat easier to unravel the galactic structure in this region than it is in the inner galaxy .",
    "the @xmath7 line - of - sight is tangent to the carina spiral arm .",
    "the region between @xmath10 and @xmath7 and @xmath11 @xmath9  and @xmath12 @xmath9  is in between spiral arms , with the carina arm towards greater longitudes and the perseus arm towards lesser longitudes or higher velocities . in the hi  and",
    "co longitude - velocity ( _ l - v _ ) diagram the carina arms forms a loop with the apex at @xmath7 , @xmath13 @xmath9 . towards greater longitudes the carina arm is seen to extend along @xmath14 @xmath9  to @xmath15 and beyond ( grabelsky et  al .",
    "1987 ) . at lesser longitudes the vela supernova remnant dominates radio continuum and x - ray emission towards @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper we report on the discovery of two large galactic hi  shells near the carina tangent .",
    "one , gsh 277 + 0 + 36 , is centered at a galactic longitude of @xmath17 , latitude of @xmath18 and velocity @xmath19 @xmath9with an angular diameter of 5.5 .",
    "the second , smaller shell , gsh 279 + 0 + 59 is centered on @xmath7 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath9  with an angular diameter of 2.7 .",
    "we will explore the possibility that the shells are interarm voids as previously suggested ( grabelsky et  al .",
    "1987 ) , and present arguments in favor of a shell interpretation . in section  [ sec :",
    "obs ] we describe the observations and analysis . in sections  [ subsec : sh1-morph ] and [ subsec : sh1-props ] we discuss the morphology and physical properties of gsh 277 + 0 + 36 . in section  [ subsec : sh2 ]",
    "we discuss the morphology and properties of gsh 279 + 0 + 59 . in section  [ subsec :",
    "otherwaves ] we compare the hi  emission with other wavebands , including far - infrared , 2.4 ghz continuum , and co. finally , in section  [ sec : disc ] we discuss possible formation methods .",
    "the observations were made as part of the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) , a large project to map the @xmath021-cm continuum and hispectral line in the fourth quadrant of the galactic plane with high angular and velocity resolution ( dickey et  al .",
    "1999 ; mcclure - griffiths et  al .",
    "the sgps makes use of high spatial resolution data from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) near narrabri , australia , and zero spacing information from the parkes 64 m radio telescope near parkes , nsw .",
    "the final project will provide a complete hi  and continuum data set of @xmath22  and @xmath23 at an angular resolution of 1 , and with velocity resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , we have extended the single dish coverage to @xmath25 in order to study large scale structures which protrude from the galactic plane .    the observations on 1998 december 15 and 16 covered the galactic longitude 253  to 358 , with galactic latitude coverage of @xmath26 .",
    "between 1999 june 18 and 21 1999 we extended the coverage to @xmath27 .",
    "we finished the extensions to @xmath28  during observations spanning 1999 september 18 - 27 .",
    "the data presented here were obtained during three observing sessions using the multibeam receiver package on the parkes telescope .",
    "the multibeam system is a thirteen beam focal plane array at @xmath021-cm .",
    "it is comprised of thirteen independent feeds , each with dual , cryogenically cooled , orthogonal , linear polarization receivers ( staveley - smith et  al .",
    "the beams are arranged on a hexagonal grid with a 29.1 separation between adjacent feeds .",
    "the array was designed to optimize dish illumination , as a result the array undersamples the focal plane ( at @xmath29-cm the beam fwhp is 14.4 .",
    "in addition , the feeds have low system temperatures ( @xmath30 k ) which , in these data , resulted in a mean rms noise of @xmath31 k in each channel .",
    "the multibeam correlator is capable of operating in several modes .",
    "there is a wide band mode as used by the hipass and zoa surveys ( staveley - smith et  al .",
    "1996 ) , as well as a new narrow band mode which operates with 2048 channels spread across an 8 mhz band ( haynes et  al .",
    "1998 ) . for this survey",
    "we operate in the latter mode in order to match the channel width ( @xmath32 @xmath9 ) of the atca data . due to computing limitations in the correlator",
    ", the narrow band mode is only operated on the inner seven beams of the multibeam system .",
    "our observing strategy at parkes was to use the multibeam receiver to map `` on - the - fly '' . in this technique ,",
    "the telescope was driven at a rate of about @xmath33 writing samples every 5 s. in order to maximize the sky coverage , and reduce redundant samples , the receiver platform was continuously rotated at an angle of @xmath34 to the scan direction as the telescope was scanned through three degrees of galactic latitude at a constant longitude .",
    "this resulted in parallel tracks with an angular separation of 9.5 . because the 9.5 spacing is worse than nyquist sampling , interleaved scans are necessary .",
    "the resultant map has parallel tracks spaced 4.7 apart . in the scan direction ,",
    "samples are 7.2 apart . in order to reduce the effects of gain variations between feeds",
    ", care was taken to ensure that independent feeds were responsible for adjacent tracks .    in order to reduce the effects of system temperature vs.  elevation variations we observed so as to maintain a nearly constant zenith angle ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we were unable to scan at a zenith angle of less than the @xmath36 without overtaxing the azimuth drives on the telescope .",
    "the iau standard regions s6 and s9 , were observed at similar zenith angles as the rest of the observations for the day .",
    "frequency switching was carried out during the observations in order to allow for rigorous off - line calibration .",
    "the spectra were centered on 1419 mhz and 1422.125 mhz , with 10 s integration times .",
    "each sample was divided by the previous frequency switched cycle to remove the front - end gain vs.frequency shape .",
    "the bandpass shape was then fitted with a series of fourier components and the data were divided by the determined shape .",
    "absolute brightness temperature calibration of the hiline data was performed using the standard regions s6 and s9 with standard line temperatures given in williams ( 1973 ) .",
    "the integral over part of the line was used to determine a calibration scale factor , @xmath37 , for each polarization on each beam .",
    "the brightness temperature was therefore calculated according to : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a smoothed version of the frequency switched , or reference , spectrum which has been corrected for the bandpass shape , @xmath40 is the mean of the reference signal over the spectrum , and @xmath41 is the average system temperature as computed on the standard calibration regions",
    ". the calibrated and lsr velocity corrected data were imported into aips using a modified version of otfuv , mbfuv , and gridded using of the task sdgrd .",
    "we used a exponential sampling function with a base of 14 , and a hphw of 5 . for this aspect of the project",
    "the continuum level was subtracted from the data using off - line channels on both sides of the line .",
    "all data were then exported to the miriad package and regridded onto a common grid of galactic coordinates .",
    "miriad and the karma package ( gooch 1995 ) were used for analysis and visualization .",
    "we here report on two large hi  voids apparent in our data , in the outer galaxy near longitude @xmath42 .",
    "these voids appear to lie along the edge of the carina arm at a galactocentric radius of @xmath43 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : lv.ps ] is a longitude - velocity ( _ l - v _ ) cut at galactic latitude @xmath44 which shows the two voids . upon careful examination of the kerr ( 1981 , 1986 ) _ l - v _ diagrams it is clear that the two voids are also apparent in the latitude averaged sample , and were identified as low density regions by kerr ( 1969 ) .",
    "below we explore the physical properties of the voids , determine that they are hi  shells , and hypothesize as to their origins .",
    "the first void is at @xmath45 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "this void is extremely dramatic with brightness temperatures on the order of 3 k in the center , whereas the brightness temperatures at the edges are on the order of 50 k. in addition , the void is apparent over a large range of velocities from @xmath46 @xmath9  to @xmath47 @xmath9 .",
    "figure [ fig : chan.ps ] shows a grey - scale representation of the channel maps over the velocity range of both holes .",
    "every second velocity channel is displayed for @xmath48 @xmath9  @xmath49 @xmath9 .",
    "there are several noteworthy features related to this void .",
    "the first is the development of the shell around @xmath50 @xmath9  at @xmath51 and @xmath44 .",
    "this feature starts as a small ring of emission and quickly grows in successive velocity channels to form the large void with brightened edges in the center of the maps .",
    "second , there is another shell - like structure at lower latitudes , centered on @xmath52 and @xmath53 from @xmath54 @xmath9  to @xmath55 @xmath9 .",
    "this shell appears to join with the larger , more prominent void by @xmath56 @xmath9 , forming one large shell .",
    "third , the shell is not entirely closed at the top and bottom .",
    "there are several filamentary extensions which extend both above and below the shell .",
    "fourth , around @xmath57 @xmath9  the back cap of the largest shell becomes visible as the strong emission in the channel maps .",
    "the full shell has an angular diameter of @xmath58 in longitude and @xmath59 in latitude , with extensions to @xmath60 .    using a standard rotation model for the galaxy ( fich , blitz and stark 1989 ) we determine a kinematic distance to the shell based on the center velocity of @xmath61 ( see figure  [ fig : profile1.ps ] ) , and a galactocentric radius of @xmath62 .",
    "using this distance we determine that the shell has a radius @xmath63 , classifying it among the largest shells , or `` supershells '' in our galaxy ( heiles 1984 ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting morphological features of the shell are the apparent break - outs in galactic latitude which extend beyond our latitude coverage to at least @xmath25 , or @xmath64 kpc at the distance of the shell .",
    "figures [ fig : chan.ps ] and [ fig : slice1.ps ] clearly show several channels to upper latitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : slice1.ps ] is a composite of three orthogonal slices through the data cube at the position marked by the cross . at the bottom",
    "l - v _ cut , the latitude - longitude ( _ l - b _ ) cut with the marked position is in the center , and to the right is the latitude - velocity ( _ b - v _ ) slice .",
    "there are at least two northern channels to the halo visible in the plane of the sky , at least two along the line of sight , and at least one complete southern channel , plus a possible second southern channel .",
    "the second southern channel may be capped as part of the low latitude shell structure noted above .",
    "it also appears that the shell is slightly inclined with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the southern chimneys are particularly visible in the early channels ( 19 @xmath65 @xmath9 ) , whereas the northern chimneys are more dominant in the later channels .",
    "this effect is also visible in the _ b - v _ slice in figure [ fig : slice1.ps ] .",
    "the extended latitude morphology strongly suggests that the supershell has in fact exceeded the scale height of the galaxy and is producing a `` chimney '' into the halo .",
    "the shell s several small channels to the upper layers are much more reminiscent of galactic `` worms '' ( khr 1992 ) , than of the large `` cone '' , or `` mushroom '' shapes detected by normandeau et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) and mashchencko et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , respectively .",
    "in fact , khr catalogued two galactic worm candidates which may be associated with the chimney edges .",
    "gw 274.7 + 2.7 at @xmath66 @xmath9  @xmath67 @xmath9 , is coincident with the northwestern chimney edge as marked in figure  [ fig : worms ] .",
    "gw 281.5 + 1.5 is given with uncertain velocities @xmath68 @xmath9  @xmath69 @xmath9 , but is coincident with a feature associated with the northeastern chimney edge at @xmath70 @xmath9   @xmath71 @xmath9 . because of the large difference in velocities it is unclear whether these structures are the same .",
    "we do not see , however , any strong hi  features at the position of gw 281.5 + 1.5 in the velocity range given by khr .",
    "additionally , khr noted that the hii  regions rcw 45 and rcw 46 lie at the base of gw 281.5 + 1.5 , placing them in the eastern edge of the shell , and rcw 42 in the western edge .      in order to better understand the nature of this object we need to know some of its physical properties such as mass , expansion velocity , and energy requirements .",
    "there are several ways to estimate the amount of mass swept up by an expanding shell . in this discussion",
    ", we will explore two of those methods and compare them with the empirical result of heiles ( 1984 ) .",
    "the first method is to calculate the column density through the center of the shell , covering the velocities which include the void as well as the shell s front and back caps . using this method we calculated the column density over the range @xmath72 @xmath9  @xmath73 @xmath9  and used the average in the center as a representative number for the shell .",
    "we determine an average column density through the shell center of @xmath74 .",
    "this value is comparable to other galactic and extragalactic supershells ( heiles 1998 ) .",
    "if we assume that the radius of the shell along the line - of - sight is approximately equal to the radius in the plane of the sky , then we find that the density of the ambient medium prior to formation must have been @xmath75 .",
    "this value is slightly high for the outer galaxy , but not unreasonable . using these values , and a factor of 1.4 to account for helium , we determine that the swept up mass of the shell is @xmath76 .",
    "an alternative way to estimate the swept - up mass is to use column densities calculated along the shell edges , rather than through the center of the shell . in this case",
    ", one determines the column density through the edges of the shell over the range of velocities where the edges are brightened , and subtracts a baseline column density which is assumed to be representative of the area into which the shell expanded .",
    "we calculated the average column density excess along the eastern and western sides of the shell .",
    "for the baseline number we used a mid - plane position far enough away from the shell to be independent of the shell walls .",
    "we determined that the mass of these to be @xmath77 . assuming that these comprise roughly half of the total shell mass",
    ", we find that the swept up mass of the shell must be @xmath78 , which is about a factor of two smaller than the previous estimate .",
    "both mass estimate methods contain possible sources of error . in the first method",
    "we assume that the galactic gas at the velocities including the shell contributes very little to the overall column density through the shell . because the brightness temperature in the void is of the order @xmath79 k , this is a reasonable assumption",
    ", however we are still likely to over estimate the mass .",
    "the largest source of error with the edge method is in calculating the baseline . on the size scale of a large supershell , density fluctuations attributed to large scale galactic structure",
    "can dramatically influence baseline estimates .",
    "also , exactly determining the area of the shell edge is very subjective , and in this case we may have underestimated the mass . on the whole , this method is less reliable than mass estimates from the center column density .",
    "it is likely , then , that our mass lies somewhere between the two estimates .",
    "neither estimate takes the mass of the chimney walls into account .",
    "comparing these mass estimates with the masses of shells listed in heiles ( 1979 ) catalog of hi  shells , we find that this supershell is in the top 25% of the most massive shells in the galaxy .",
    "using heiles ( 1979 ) empirical equation for shell masses based on the radius of the shell : @xmath80 , we find a mass of @xmath81 for a shell of this size , which severely underestimates the column density masses by as much as 70 - 85% .",
    "since our masses were determined in a similar manner to heiles ( 1979 ) , the severe departure from the global shell characteristics is surprising .",
    "the shell appears to be extremely massive for its size .",
    "another important shell characteristic is the expansion velocity .",
    "this value can help determine the required creation energy and the age .",
    "we estimated the expansion velocity of this shell in two ways .",
    "first , we made a velocity profile through the center of the shell , which is compared with the galactic rotation curve along that line - of - sight in figure [ fig : profile1.ps ] .",
    "the large trough between @xmath82 @xmath9  and @xmath83 @xmath9  is the shell . using the peaks at either velocity extreme of the shell we estimate a full velocity width of @xmath84 @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to separate the spatial information from the true velocity information .",
    "however , the velocity gradient for this line of sight is @xmath85 , which corresponds to a velocity spread due to the spatial extent of only @xmath86 @xmath9  for a spherical shell .",
    "we therefore assume that to first order the expansion velocity is half of the full velocity width , giving @xmath87 @xmath9 .",
    "we also made use of the tool _ kshell _ in the karma visualization package to estimate the expansion velocity .",
    "_ kshell _ computes an average brightness temperature on annuli about a user defined center .",
    "a shell will appear as a half ellipse in the resultant radius - velocity ( _ r - v _ ) diagram .",
    "figure [ fig : rv1.ps ] is the _ r - v _ diagram for gsh 277 + 0 + 36 .",
    "using the _ r - v _ diagram we can validate our center , since incorrectly choosing the center will result in a double ellipse .",
    "we then determine @xmath88 @xmath9 , half of the ellipse width .",
    "the close agreement between the r - v diagram expansion velocity , which is essentially an average of all velocity profiles through the shell , and the single velocity profile through the shell center is comforting .",
    "finally , we must consider the possibility that the shell is not expanding , but simply a quiescent hole or empty region in the hi . in this case",
    "the velocity spread through the center would translate to a line - of - sight depth of 4 kpc , while the diameter in the plane of the sky is only 610 pc .    using the expansion velocity and shell size",
    ", we can calculate the expansion energy the shell , @xmath89 .",
    "the expansion energy is defined as the required amount of energy instantaneously deposited at the center of the shell to account for the shell s present size and rate of expansion .",
    "based on chevalier s ( 1974 ) calculations for supernova remnant expansion , heiles ( 1979 ) gives a formula for the expansion energy of a shell of radius , @xmath90 expanding with a velocity of @xmath91 into a medium with ambient density , @xmath92 : @xmath93 where @xmath92 is in @xmath94 , @xmath90 is in pc , and @xmath91 is in @xmath9 . using @xmath95 , as calculated above , we find that the expansion energy is @xmath96 ergs .",
    "there is no evidence in the channel maps ( figure  [ fig : chan.ps ] ) that the shell has been significantly sheared by the effects of differential rotation .",
    "we can use this fact , the size of the shell , and its expansion velocity to place limits of the age of the supershell . from the fact that the shell does not show dramatic deformation , we estimate that its age is less than @xmath97 myr ( tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) .",
    "we also calculate an upper limit on the shell s age of @xmath98 myr using its present rate of expansion and size . given the uncertainties involved in determining the shell s expansion velocity and whether or not it may have stalled , we estimate an age in the range 15 - 25 myr . it is noted , however , that this age is very small for an object this large .",
    "examining the _ l - v _ diagram in figure [ fig : lv.ps ] it is clear that there are two shells which share a common line - of - sight . in figure",
    "[ fig : chan.ps ] one can see this second shell develop around @xmath99 @xmath9at @xmath7 , @xmath44 .",
    "this shell is much less pronounced than shell 1 , with only a factor of 4 or 5 difference between the rim and the center of the void .",
    "the effects of limb brightening are not nearly as noticeable , except on the back edge as seen in the _ l - v _ diagram . following the iau naming convention",
    ", we name the shell , which is centered on @xmath100 , @xmath101  and @xmath102 @xmath9 , gsh 280 + 0 + 59 . using the center velocity we determine a kinematic distance of @xmath103 kpc , and a galactocentric radius of @xmath104 kpc . given its angular diameter of 2.6 , we calculate a physical radius , @xmath105 pc .",
    "figure  [ fig : slice2.ps ] shows three orthogonal slices ( _ l - v , l - b , b - v _ ) through the cube .",
    "though it is not clear in the channel maps , it is quite apparent in the _ b - v _ slice , that this shell is also breaking out of the disk .",
    "there is one cone - like chimney to the north , and a jet - like structure to the south of the shell .",
    "these are both most easily seen in the _ b - v _ slice .",
    "there is is no apparent cap to the chimney which indicates that it extends to at least 1.4 kpc , far exceeding the hi  scale height .    in order to determine the mass of the shell , we calculated the column density through the center as described above .",
    "because the shell edges are much less noticeable than in shell 1 , we were unable to accurately determine an area over which to calculate the column density .",
    "for the averaged center column density we find @xmath106 . again , assuming that the radius along the line - of - sight is comparable to the radius in the plane of the sky , we find that the ambient density must have been @xmath107 .",
    "this value agrees quite well with expected values for the outer galaxy . finally , we calculate a swept - up mass of @xmath108 .",
    "gsh 280 + 0 + 59 shell also appears to be expanding , though with a smaller velocity than shell 1 .",
    "r - v _ diagram in figure  [ fig : rv2.ps ] clearly shows the characteristic half ellipsoidal void for shell 2 . as with gsh 277 + 0 + 36 , the velocity gradient is @xmath109 , so we assume that the expansion velocity is approximately half of the full velocity width .",
    "using figure  [ fig : rv2.ps ] we determine an expansion velocity of @xmath110 @xmath9 .",
    "the shell is more clearly seen in the velocity profile ( figure  [ fig : profile2.ps ] ) , which lends the result of @xmath111 @xmath9 . using equation  [ eq : energy ] to estimate the expansion energy , we find @xmath112 ergs , placing this shell in the range of moderate energies , easily achievable from the combined effects of stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "the two shells appear to be interconnected around @xmath113 @xmath9 . though the morphology supports the case that the two shells are associated , it is unclear whether the association is physical . on the morphological side of the argument , one notices in figures  [ fig : lv.ps ] and [ fig : slice2.ps ] that the wall which separates the two shells is brightest in the longitude region where they overlap ( @xmath114 ) , and both shells appear more compressed in that range of longitudes than they do on the non - interacting side .",
    "this is consistent with expansion slowed by interaction of the two high density walls . physically speaking , though",
    ", it is improbable that the shells could be associated shells if located at the exact distances implied by their central velocities , as it would imply line - of - sight extents on the order of kiloparsecs .",
    "however , the errors for the shell distances are quite large , so that the shell centers may be brought closer together , to within only 1.2 kpc . in this case , a slight elongation of the shells along the line - of - sight could overlap the shells . alternately ,",
    "if one or both of the shells has a systemic velocity which deviates slightly from its local standard of rest , the shells could also overlap .",
    "both possibilities are conceivable , since the shells are presumably undergoing exaggerated expansion away from the carina arm , and the more massive shell could impart a slight systemic velocity on the other shell .",
    "related to the latter argument , it is logical to expect shell 2 to be older than shell 1 , and hence able to receive a small kick from shell 1 as it expanded .",
    "the expansion velocity for shell 2 is smaller , and its edges are much less brightened , implying an older age . finally ,",
    "because both shells trace the edge of the carina arm , it would seem likely that they are associated .",
    "the physical properties for both shells are given in table  [ tab : props ] .",
    "error estimates for the distances are based on our ability to estimate the center velocity of the shell and random hi  cloud motions .",
    "since both shells are against the carina arm it is likely that the shells are asymmetric in velocity .",
    "we assume that the center velocities are accurate to within @xmath115 which accounts for an estimated error of 7 @xmath9  in determining the center velocity and @xmath116 for random cloud motions ( dickey 1997 ) .",
    "we have obtained publicly available 2.4 ghz continuum ( duncan et  al .",
    "1995 ) , x - ray ( snowden et  al .  1995 ) and far - infrared data ( wheelock et  al .",
    "1994 ) on this region for comparison with the hi  data .",
    "we also obtained co data from grabelsky et  al .",
    "the primary correlation amongst all bands is a lack of emission in the region 270  @xmath117 285 .",

    "using data on the co ( @xmath118 ) transition from dame et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , we have calculated the co column density map for the range of velocities of shell 1 .",
    "the co column density contours are overlaid on the @xmath119 @xmath9  hi  image in figure  [ fig : co1.ps ] .",
    "there are several patches of co emission which lie on the edge of the shell , and no detectable emission in the shell interior . for a shell created by either stellar winds , or an hvc impact , it is reasonable to expect molecular clouds and stellar formation in the compressed gas along the shell shock front .",
    "the most distinct co feature is a molecular cloud is at @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 @xmath9  as given in table 2 of grabelsky et  al .",
    "in addition , the lack of co emission in the shell interior may be as significant as the clouds seen on the edge , indicating that the region is devoid of cold , dense gas .",
    "figure  [ fig:2.4ghz ] is a map of shell 1 at @xmath123 @xmath9  with 2.4 ghz continuum contours overlaid .",

    "lies snr g279.0 + 1.1 ( woermann & jonas 1988 ; duncan et  al .",
    "woermann & jonas ( 1988 ) noted the coincidental position of the strong hi feature at @xmath123 @xmath9  and the brighter limb of the snr . using the @xmath124 relationship they determined a distance to the snr of @xmath79 kpc .",
    "they concluded that the snr could not be associated with the hi  feature , as that would place the snr at @xmath125 kpc and result in a very large physical snr diameter ( @xmath126 pc ) .",
    "because the @xmath124 relationship is highly uncertain , we attempted to find a kinematic distance to the remnant .",
    "we searched the snr for associated absorption features and morphological matches between the hi  and continuum .",
    "we were unable , however to find any such features , and therefore can not conclusively say whether or not there is an association between the the snr and the supershell .",
    "we also explored x - ray maps at 1/4 kev , 3/4 kev , and 1.5 kev from snowden et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) . in the case",
    "that the shell was young we might expect to see anti - correlated x - rays from the hot interior gas .",
    "the 1/4 kev map unfortunately has a large instrumental discontinuity through the center of the shell , making it difficult to determine any characteristics .",
    "however , 1/4 kev x - rays are absorbed by relatively small neutral column densities .",
    "given that the column density to these shells is @xmath127 , we would not expect to see 1/4 kev x - rays .",
    "x - rays at 3/4 kev begin to be significantly absorped at column densities of @xmath128 , therefore we would expect the 3/4 kev map to show significant attenuation if there were emission from the shell interior . neither the 3/4 kev map , nor 1.5 kev map shows any distinct anti - correlation with the hicolumn density map .",
    "figure  [ fig:100micron ] is an _ iras _ 5  resolution map of 100 @xmath129 m emission in the region with hi  column density contours overlaid .",
    "as we would expect , there is good correlation between the hi  column density and the 100 @xmath129 m dust emission on the left rim of the shell .",
    "in addition , there is little emission throughout the shell interior . the wispy , fine scale structure in the shell",
    "interior traces the outflow directions well .",
    "the decrease in hi as well as co emission , in the region @xmath130 and 15 @xmath9  @xmath131 @xmath9  was previously noted and identified as an interarm region between the carina and external spiral arms ( kerr et  al .",
    "1969 ; grabelsky et  al .",
    "1987 ) . in the case",
    "that this void is an interarm region its decrease in brightness temperature from arm to interarm by more than a factor 16 would make it the most pronounced arm edge in the galaxy by more than 50% ( grabelsky et  al .",
    "previous data , however , had either poor angular resolution , or averaged over galactic latitude so that the shell - like morphology of the void was not apparent .",
    "we now have the resolution and sensitivity necessary to discern the shell edges .",
    "it appears that the void is not simply an interarm region , but in fact , a galactic supershell .",
    "the shell edges curve around to partially close the shell at the top and bottom .",
    "in addition , the shell appears limb brightened on all edges , suggesting gas compression due to the shell s expansion . both of these traits , as well as the observed expansion ,",
    "are inconsistent with an interarm interpretation .",
    "the bowl shape of the velocity profile through the center of the shell ( figure  [ fig : profile1.ps ] ) is indicative of a shell , as well . finally , there are breakouts , where the shell appears to be blowing gas up into the galactic halo .",
    "all of the morphological evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the gas has been displaced , both parallel to and out of the plane .",
    "based on the size , energy requirements , and positions of these shells we explore possible formation methods .",
    "gsh 277 + 0 + 36 is difficult to understand because of its large energy requirements , relatively large size and mass , and unusual position adjacent to the carina tangent . as suggested by many authors ( heiles 1984 , rand & van der hulst 1993 ) it is difficult to envisage a shell with expansion energies in excess of @xmath5 ergs created by the combined effects of sne and stellar winds . in this particular case",
    "if we use 15 myr as an upper limit to the age , assume sne with energies of @xmath132 ergs , then we would expect a supernova rate on the order of one every @xmath133 yrs in the progenitor ob association , which is about four times higher than suggested by tomisaka & ikeuchi ( 1986 ) .",
    "for the galaxy as a whole , the supernova rate is about one every fifty to a hundred years ( cappellaro et  al .",
    "1999 ) , or @xmath134 .",
    "gsh 277 + 0 + 36 supershell would require a supernova rate of the same order as the galactic rate .",
    "it is not reasonable to expect the supernova rate in an interarm region of the outer galaxy to be as high as the rate for the galaxy as whole ( unless there is a star cluster in the interarm region , which might be possible if a molecular cloud survives the arm / interarm transition ) .",
    "a search of ob association catalogs reveals no associations in the neighborhood of either gsh 277 + 0 + 36 or gsh 280 + 0 + 59 ( humphreys 1978 ; melnik & efremor 1995 ) .",
    "however , the majority of ob associations listed in these catalogs are restricted to a 3  kpc radius from the sun , so it is unlikely that an ob association at the distance of gsh 277 + 0 + 36 would have been catalogued . finally , as mentioned above ,",
    "the only known snr in the region is g279.0 + 1.1 ( duncan et  al .  1992 ) , for which there is no conclusive association with the shell . for a large majority of supershells ,",
    "however , no ob associations or supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been associated .",
    "the estimate of the initial hi  number density in the region of @xmath135 is also inconsistent with values expected for interarm regions .",
    "it would seem that there has been mass influx to boost the number density of the ambient medium . on the basis of all these difficulties with formation theory as a result of stellar winds and supernovae in an interarm region ,",
    "we are forced to question whether the supershell may have formed differently .",
    "one can think of two possible alternative explanations .",
    "first , that the shell was formed as a result of a high velocity cloud ( hvc ) impact .",
    "second , that the shell actually formed in the edge of the carina spiral arm then expanded into and widened the interarm region .",
    "we first consider the possibility that the shell was formed by the impact of a hvc with the galactic disk .",
    "this possibility has been suggested by numerous authors as an alternative way to reach the high energy requirements of supershells ( tenorio - tagle 1980 ; heiles 1984 ; tenorio - tagle et  al .",
    "several hvc - galactic disk collisions have been hypothesized in external galaxies .",
    "the most thoroughly explored of these is the large supershell in ngc 4631 ( rand & van der hulst 1993 ; rand & stone 1996 ) , which is believed to have been formed with an input energy on the order of @xmath136 ergs .",
    "the extremely large energy demands of this shell required an alternative explanation to sne and stellar winds . another argument in favor of cloud - disk collisions is that they can occur at any place in the galaxy , and hence overcome the problem of large stellar population dependent shells . in the case of gsh 277 + 0 + 36 , which is located in a region of low stellar population density",
    ", a cloud - disk collision seems reasonable .",
    "a cloud - disk collision could also result in a deposition of cloud mass in the region , resulting in the anomalously high ambient density calculated .",
    "however , one does not necessarily expect the morphology of an hvc - disk impact to resemble the morphology of gsh 277 + 0 + 36 .",
    "though models show a spherical shock developing for hvcs travelling at low enough velocities , the nearly closed edges combined with multiple channel - like extensions is inconsistent with models ( tenorio - tagle et  al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "an alternative , and perhaps more plausible , explanation is that the shell was formed at the edge of the carina spiral arm , and therefore widened the interarm region to appear as though the shell actually formed in between spiral arms . in this scenario , it is not impossible to imagine stellar populations dense enough in the spiral arm to provide the @xmath137 supernova producing ob stars required to make the shell .",
    "in addition , the intertwining shells that make up gsh 277 + 0 + 36 indicate that there may have been more than one wave of star formation . in which case , it is much more likely that there would have been enough energy to create this shell with supernovae and stellar winds . furthermore , if the shell did form in the edge of the spiral arm the energy requirements would be decreased .",
    "the chevalier ( 1974 ) expansion energy equation assumes expansion into a relatively uniform medium .",
    "however , a shell expanding into a lower density region can attain a larger radius and expansion velocity than one expanding into a constant , higher density region .",
    "if the ambient medium density dropped by a factor of @xmath138 at the edge of the arm , then shell expansion would be accentuated in the direction of the interarm region by as much as 15% .",
    "the shell would also not decelerate as quickly , resulting in a larger measured expansion velocity .",
    "these two factors lead to a calculated expansion energy which may be as much as a factor of two higher than the actual energy required to create this shell .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the energy would still fall within the calculated errors .",
    "in conclusion , we have found two large hi shells in the outer galaxy .",
    "the first and most dramatic , gsh 277 + 0 + 36 , can be classified as a supershell on the basis of its large size and expansion energy .",
    "prior interpretation of this large void as an interarm region now seems inappropriate on the basis of the supershell s chimney and shell - like morphology .",
    "the supershell most probably exists in the region between spiral arms , though it was not necessarily formed there .",
    "the strong arm - interam contrast previously noticed has undoubtedly been enhanced by the supershell edges .",
    "we find evidence for molecular clouds along the supershell s edges , indicating that star formation may have been initiated by the supershell s expansion . because of the shell s unusual position between spiral arms , and its large formation energy requirements we have considered several formation theories for this shell .",
    "we have considered the conventional formation method of stellar winds and supernovae , an hvc collision with the galactic disk , and finally we have raised the possibility that the shell formed in the carina arm and expanded into the interarm region .",
    "we believe that the latter is the most likely scenario , as it decreases the energy requirements and is consistent with theories of galactic structure which predict higher star formation rates and therefore higher supernova rates in the spiral arms .",
    "the second shell , gsh 280 + 0 + 59 , though smaller than the first shell , is large by galactic standards with @xmath139 pc .",
    "it also appears to have blown out of the galactic plane .",
    "while there is no definitive interaction between the two shells , it is possible that they may be interacting if one has a systemic velocity which departs from its local of standard of rest by @xmath97 @xmath9 .",
    "they appear , however , to be distinct shells which presumably formed independently .",
    "the energy requirements for the smaller shell are much more reasonable , indicating that the shell could have been created by @xmath97 supernovae , or equivalent stellar winds , over several million years .",
    "the effects of these shells on their local ism is dramatic .",
    "regardless of whether they are associated and whether or not gsh 277 + 0 + 36 formed in the carina arm , they have significantly reshaped the large scale structure of the galaxy in that region on the timescale of millions of years . because other galaxies are so dramatically influenced by shells , supershells , and chimneys ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the milky way has been similarly influenced .",
    "however , the catalogued shells and chimneys have not revealed the level of influence on the structure of the milky way as those seen in the large and small magellenic clouds .",
    "in addition , the relatively few chimneys seen can not support the halo .",
    "we expect , therefore , that there are many more supershells and chimneys to be detected as we probe deeper into the galaxy with the southern galactic plane survey .",
    "it is imperative to understanding the structure of the galaxy that we have a complete catalog of supershells and chimneys , particularly in the inner galaxy .",
