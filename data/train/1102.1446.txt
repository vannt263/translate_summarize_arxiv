    "averaged over large scales in disk galaxies , the relationship between the mean surface density of star formation , @xmath0 , and the mean gaseous surface density , @xmath7 , is observed to be superlinear , both in the local universe and at higher redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior reflects the increased efficiency ( or shorter timescale ) of star formation under conditions of higher mean gas density , which is correlated with higher @xmath7 .",
    "starburst regions within the central @xmath11 of galaxies , commonly observed as dust - enshrouded lirgs and ulirgs in which the ism is predominantly molecular , represent the extreme of this behavior , with @xmath12 and the star formation ( or gas conversion ) timescale @xmath13 a factor of 10 or more below @xmath14 in lower-@xmath7 regions of galaxies . although earlier observations based on global averages suggested a simple power - law relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath0 , these global relations have considerable scatter about the mean .",
    "more recently , evidence has emerged that the star formation regime within galactic centers at very high @xmath15 is distinct from the star formation regime that prevails in the main disks of galaxies at lower @xmath16 . within the main disk ,",
    "another change in the star formation regime appears to occur from `` mid - disk '' to `` outer - disk . '' typically ,",
    "both galactic center and mid - disk regions are primarily molecular , whereas outer disks are primarily atomic .",
    "figure ( [ fig1 ] ) provides a schematic , dividing the disk into different star - forming regimes .    in main - disk regions",
    "where @xmath16 , high - resolution observations have found that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath17 , the mean surface density of molecular gas , with a timescale @xmath18 @xcite . the value @xmath19 that defines the upper limit for `` main disks '' is characteristic of the surface density @xmath20 of individual giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , as observed in the milky way and local group @xcite .",
    "the relation @xmath21 for @xmath22 is consistent with the idea that spatially - isolated gmcs have an approximately constant specific star formation rate ; this rate , and the value of @xmath23 , may be controlled by internal feedback processes within gmcs ( e.g. @xcite ) , although this is not yet completely understood . over a typical gmc lifetime of @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 of the gas",
    "must be converted to stars in order to yield @xmath26 within main - disk regions .",
    "although there are uncertainties arising from limited resolution and calibration of the co - to - h@xmath27 conversion ( see section 4 ) , the relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath0 in galactic center regions with @xmath15 appears considerably steeper than linear . presumably , this is because the molecular gas in galactic center regions with @xmath15 is at higher mean ( volume ) density than the molecular gas in main - disk gmcs having `` standard '' surface density @xmath29 .",
    "molecular gas dominates mid - disk regions , but is a small fraction of the total in outer disks , where @xmath7 and the disk s stellar density @xmath30 are lower @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently advanced a theory to explain the star - forming behavior and balance of phases in the main regions of disks at @xmath16 , based on the requirement that the diffuse gas must be in both thermal and dynamical equilibrium . in this theory ,",
    "star - forming gravitationally - bound clouds are assumed to have internal pressures much larger than their surroundings , consistent with local gmc observations .",
    "thus , they are effectively isolated , and over their lifetimes are assumed to maintain a mean internal specific star formation rate consistent with the empirical main - disk value @xmath31 .",
    "in equilibrium , individual gravitationally - bound clouds form and disperse at equal rates , with neutral ism gas cycling between the diffuse and gravitationally - bound components .",
    "in outer - disk regions ( typically @xmath32 , although this varies with @xmath30 ) , the equilibrium fraction of gas in star - forming bound clouds is just enough that the heating provided by the resulting stellar uv balances the cooling of the surrounding diffuse ; here , @xmath33 . in mid - disk regions ( typically @xmath34 ) ,",
    "the interstellar medium becomes predominantly molecular ( by mass ) because the heating provided by star formation would be insufficient to balance cooling in high - density warm atomic gas ( which is compressed by the vertical disk gravity ) ; here @xmath35 .",
    "the model of @xcite assumes that most of the volume is filled by non - star - forming atomic gas , and thus is inapplicable to the starburst regime in galactic centers where @xmath15 and gas is mostly molecular .    where @xmath7 is very high ,",
    "the conditions throughout the ism resemble those in the interior of locally - observed gmcs , but are even more extreme in terms of the mean densities , the abundance of very high density gas , and the ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath36 to the thermal speed @xmath37 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "supersonic turbulence is known to be a dominant process controlling star formation regulation within gmcs , so it is expected to be important in starburst regions as well .",
    "main - disk gmcs are relatively isolated entities , in the sense that their internal dynamical timescales are short compared to the orbital , epicyclic and vertical oscillation times in the galactic potential ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively ) . in galactic center regions",
    ", however , the gravitational potential is deeper , such that @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are all substantially higher , with timescales @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the galactic environment may also significantly impact the development of star formation .",
    "turbulence in the ism both inhibits and encourages star formation . for regions large compared to the energy ( and momentum ) injection scale , turbulence provides an effective pressure that opposes gravity . in the ism , this helps to regulate the mean density averaged over the disk thickness @xmath45 , and therefore the large - scale self - gravitational timescale @xmath46 . here",
    ", the gas disk semi - thickness @xmath47 varies with turbulent velocity dispersion as @xmath48 or @xmath49 depending on whether stellar or gas gravity dominates the vertical potential gradients . in either case , larger turbulent velocities raise @xmath47 and @xmath50 for the ism disk , while larger stellar and gas densities lower @xmath47 and @xmath51 . on scales smaller than the turbulent injection ,",
    "supersonic compression creates local overdense regions @xmath52 that potentially can collapse more rapidly than the larger - scale regions containing them since @xmath53 .",
    "however , turbulent rarefactions and shear also destroy overdensities . because @xmath54 depends on density",
    ", turbulence will disperse the moderate - density structures before self - gravity can concentrate them further , while allowing the highest - density regions ( amounting to a small fraction of the mass ) to collapse and form stars .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest that the fraction of mass in turbulent systems that collapses to form stars will be relatively insensitive to the velocity dispersion ( @xcite ; see also section 5 ) , so that the overall star formation rate is primarily governed by the gravitational time on large scales , @xmath51 .",
    "since massive stars energize the ism , raising the velocity dispersion and @xmath55 , the associated feedback loop may allow star formation rates to be self - regulated .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the process of self - regulation via turbulent driving , for application to understanding what controls star formation rates in starburst disks . for molecule - dominated regions ,",
    "cooling times are short , so it is the injection of momentum , rather than energy , that is essential in defining the dynamical state of the disk .",
    "thus , we begin in section 2 by considering the implications of maintaining force balance in the vertical direction , which imposes a requirement on the input momentum flux associated with star formation feedback .",
    "we show that for disks where supernovae dominate the feedback , the star formation rate is expected to vary as @xmath56 . at very high surface density in optically - thick disks , radiation pressure can exceed the turbulent pressure driven by supernovae , which leads to @xmath57 . in section 3 , we compare our prediction for @xmath0 vs. @xmath7 in turbulence - dominated disks to the results of numerical simulations , for which feedback is explicitly implemented in local vertically - resolved models of self - gravitating , rotating disks .",
    "section 4 compares the prediction for @xmath0 vs. @xmath7 to observations of galaxies in the regime where the turbulence - dominated model is expected to apply .",
    "both the numerical simulations and the observations are consistent with the simple analytic model . in section 5 , we connect to models relating star formation rates to @xmath58 , and discuss how the mean internal properties ( including velocity dispersion and disk thickness ) of turbulence - dominated , feedback - regulated disks are expected to depend on @xmath7 and the parameters that characterize the star formation feedback .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with a brief summary and discussion .",
    "consider a region of a galactic disk with gas surface density @xmath7 , residing within a bulge of uniform density @xmath59 , such that the gas - disk gravitational potential is @xmath60 and the bulge potential is @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that the gas disk s internal structure is similar to that of a gmc , in that it is highly inhomogeneous ( due to supersonic turbulence ) but most of the gas concentrations are transient .",
    "the disk is thus taken to consist primarily of `` diffuse '' gas , in the sense that only a small fraction of the mass at any time lies in bound clumps having gravitational potential large compared to the mean midplane value in the disk . with an effectively plane - parallel distribution of mean gas density",
    ", the mean gravitational potential depends only on the distance from the midplane @xmath62 . the time - averaged , horizontally - averaged vertical momentum equation ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "may then be vertically integrated , yielding the result that the total momentum flux through the disk must be equal to the total vertical weight of the overlying gas .    at the midplane ,",
    "the weight includes a self - gravitational term , @xmath63 where we have used @xmath64 and @xmath65 for a slab ; and a term arising from the external bulge potential ) for a stellar bulge differs from the corresponding equation for a stellar disk in @xcite by a factor @xmath66 . ] , @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the mean ( area - weighted ) density of the gas at height @xmath62 , and @xmath8 is the midplane value .",
    "the value of the numerical coefficient @xmath69 is insensitive to the exact vertical distribution of the gas , equaling @xmath70 for a gaussian ( when @xmath61 dominates ) and @xmath71 for a @xmath72 distribution ( when @xmath60 dominates ) ; @xmath73 within @xmath74 for these distributions .",
    "note that the self - gravitational weight is independent of the midplane gas density , whereas the weight in the external bulge potential is proportional to @xmath75 .",

    "the thermal and turbulent terms can be combined as a single midplane kinetic pressure @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the observed velocity dispersion for a face - on disk .",
    "note that @xmath84 corresponds to a volume - weighted mean pressure , and @xmath85 corresponds to a mass - weighted average of thermal speeds of different components : if @xmath86 and @xmath87 for mass and volume with @xmath88 , then @xmath89 . for molecule - dominated regions , the rms thermal speed @xmath90 if @xmath91 , whereas observed velocity dispersions are at least several @xmath92 so that @xmath93 . for convenience",
    ", we shall use @xmath94 to denote the rms value @xmath95 .",
    "the momentum flux difference also contains magnetic terms , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denotes the difference between midplane values and values at the surface of the neutral - gas disk .",
    "numerical simulations of highly - supersonic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) have shown that the magnetic energy is typically smaller than the turbulent energy by a factor @xmath98 , so that @xmath99 ; this is also consistent with observations @xcite . since the magnetic scale height @xmath100 is typically large compared to the semi - thickness @xmath101 of the neutral - gas layer in galactic disks , the ratio @xmath102 , so that the resulting magnetic contribution to the momentum flux difference will be small ( @xmath103 \\rho_0 \\langle v_z^2\\rangle$ ] ) .",
    "cosmic rays and radiation may also contribute to the momentum flux difference , with respective terms @xmath104 and @xmath105 . including all terms",
    ", the total momentum flux corresponds to an effective midplane pressure @xmath106 .    by equating @xmath107 with the total weight ( the sum of equations [ gas_weight ] and [ bulgeweight ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath108 here , @xmath109 characterizes the contribution to vertical support from non - kinetic compared to kinetic terms .",
    "the term @xmath110 represents the contribution to the gas disk s weight from the external bulge potential compared to the gas disk s self - gravitational weight .",
    "since the midplane gas density is given by @xmath111 , the vertical equilibrium equation ( [ pmid_eq ] ) is a quadratic in @xmath112 that can be solved to obtain @xmath113^{1/2 } } ,   \\label{chi_def}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 depends only on large - scale properties of the system .",
    "note that @xmath115 is approximately equal to the ratio of scale heights for a disk - only potential compared to a bulge - only potential , so that @xmath116 if the gas disk dominates vertical gravity and @xmath117 if the bulge dominates vertical gravity .    equation ( [ chi_def ] ) can also be rearranged to yield @xmath118 ; when @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",

    "also , note that the bulge potential generally dominates orbital motion ( even if the gas potential dominates vertical motion ) , with a factor @xmath137 for the stellar vs. gas contributions to @xmath138 .",
    "if star formation is self - regulated via momentum inputs , we expect the turbulent portion of the vertical momentum flux through the disk , @xmath139 , to be comparable to the total vertical momentum per unit time per unit area that is injected in the gas by feedback from star formation . for isotropic momentum",
    "@xmath140 injected per massive star near the midplane , averaging over spherical shells yields a vertical component injected on each side of the disk of @xmath141 .",
    "we shall therefore adopt the relation @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the total mass in stars formed per massive star .",
    "the ratio @xmath144 is simply the mean radial momentum injected in the ism per unit mass of stars formed .",
    "we have introduced a factor @xmath145 to parameterize the dependence on the details of turbulent injection and dissipation .",
    "the value of @xmath145 is expected to vary between 1 ( for strong dissipation ) and 2 ( for weak dissipation ; this is the limit for a stream of particles that is injected vertically and conserves energy as the particles fall back to the midplane ) .",
    "the kinetic momentum injected in the ism per massive star can have contributions from a number of sources , including expanding regions , stellar winds , and supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if star clusters are born in sufficiently optically - thick regions with deep gravitational potential wells , radiation pressure also becomes important in accelerating the residual gas to high velocities @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimates the momentum injected by an expanding region for a given source of ionizing luminosity and ambient density within a gmc , finding a ratio of momentum - to - mass @xmath146 for clouds of mass @xmath147 . using the results of @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath148 for @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 the mass , radius , and integrated star - forming efficiency of a gmc , so that gmcs with escape speeds @xmath152 or @xmath153 would have @xmath154 .",
    "radiation pressure is most important when gas is concentrated near a central stellar cluster and the efficiency is high ( see appendix a ) , so that the value of @xmath144 will be comparable to the escape speed from the ( super)cluster that forms  up to @xmath155 for the most extreme clusters .",
    "although radiation and ionized - gas momentum inputs are important for destroying individual gravitationally - bound gmcs ( thereby limiting star formation ) , supernovae are likely the most important feedback mechanism for driving turbulence in the ism as a whole @xcite . for supernova energy of @xmath156 and ambient density @xmath157 ,",
    "the momentum injection per event is @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "if multiple supernovae combine to drive a single expanding shell , stellar winds contribute as well , but this increases the total energy ( and momentum , which is approximately linear in the input energy ) per unit mass by less than @xmath159 @xcite . for a @xcite imf , the total mass in stars per high mass star ( @xmath160 ) is @xmath161 ,",
    "so we shall adopt @xmath162 from supernovae as our fiducial numerical value",
    ".    under the assumption that cosmic rays are accelerated by supernova blast waves and diffuse vertically out of the disk , the momentum flux contribution from cosmic rays will be proportional to that from supernovae , with @xmath163 here , @xmath164 is the efficiency of cosmic ray production per supernova of energy @xmath165 , and we have assumed that the cosmic ray fluid streams at speed @xmath166 .",
    "the mean free path of cosmic rays , @xmath167 , is likely comparable the magnetic scale height @xmath100 @xcite .",

    "the surface density of star formation is @xmath192 as noted above , disks that are marginally gravitationally unstable ( @xmath193 ) have @xmath194 .",
    "thus , turbulence - controlled , self - regulated star formation in galactic centers is expected to follow a scaling relation @xmath56 .    at very high surface densities such that @xmath195 ( and assuming @xmath196 ) , the star formation rate in the radiation - pressure - dominated regime is @xmath197 which is linear rather than quadratic in the gas surface density",
    ".    equation ( [ sigma_sfr_turb ] ) would apply to galactic center regions experiencing all but the most extreme starburst activity , with a transition to the radiation - dominated regime of equation ( [ sigma_sfr_rad ] ) at @xmath198 , corresponding to a gas surface density @xmath199 the self - regulated turbulent galactic - center regime of equation ( [ sigma_sfr_turb ] ) connects with the `` mid - disk '' regime , where internal gmc processes control star formation ( see section 1 ) , at lower surface densities . setting equation ( [ sigma_sfr_turb ] ) equal to @xmath200 with @xmath201 comparable to the empirical mid - disk value @xmath202 @xcite and assuming @xmath196 , the nominal transition to the mid - disk regime is at @xmath203 physically , this transition occurs because at low surface densities , the energy input from star formation is insufficient to prevent `` diffuse '' molecular gas from becoming concentrated in individual gravitationally - bound gmcs .",
    "to initiate a numerical study of star formation under high surface density conditions , we begin with a very simple computational model , which nevertheless includes sufficient ingredients that we are able to investigate self - regulation of star formation in turbulence - dominated disks . our simulation domain represents a local region within a starburst disk , which we resolve both vertically and horizontally .",
    "the domain is rotating with the disk , so we include centrifugal and coriolis forces ; we assume a solid - body rotation curve , so there is no large - scale rotational shear within the domain .",
    "we assume that the gas cools efficiently to maintain an approximately constant ( low ) temperature , so we adopt an isothermal equation of state with sound speed @xmath204 .",
    "for this first study , we neglect magnetic fields .",
    "thus , the dynamical equations we solve are : @xmath205 @xmath206 and @xmath207 ( e.g. @xcite , taking dimensionless shear parameter @xmath208 ) . for a spherical bulge , the vertical gravitational field is given by @xmath209 .",
    "we integrate the dynamical equations using a version of the _ athena _ code @xcite , which employs a single - step , directionally - unsplit godunov scheme @xcite to obtain conservative , second - order accurate solutions .",
    "the poisson equation is solved using the fourier transform method of @xcite , suitable for disk problems that are treated as having open boundary conditions in the vertical ( @xmath210 ) direction and periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions .",

    "as figure ( [ fig2 ] ) shows , the structure is highly inhomogeneous due to the dominance of turbulence , which shocks and compresses the gas .",
    "effects of recent star formation events are seen as dense circular regions ; these drive expanding shells , which are also evident .",
    "although structure is irregular and highly dynamic , gas is preferentially concentrated toward the midplane due to gravity ; this is where star formation events take place , in the densest gas .",

    "the numerical results are consistent with the prediction given in equation ( [ sigma_sfr_turb ] ) for momentum - controlled , self - regulated disk star formation .",
    "we note that both turbulence and small - scale self - gravity are crucial in determining the star formation rate in these simulations .",
    "for all of the models , our adopted @xmath221 exceeds the midplane value of the density for a purely thermally supported slab ( with the adopted value @xmath226 ) , so no star formation would take place without localized gravitational collapse . on the other hand , if we had not imposed a high threshold density and had simply _ assumed _ a star formation rate equal to @xmath245 for our adopted @xmath220 and @xmath246 ( see section 5 ) , we would have obtained the same scaling with surface density @xmath56 as found with our simulations ( and as predicted by equation [ [ sigma_sfr_turb ] ] ) , but a much larger coefficient : @xmath247 . for the value @xmath248 used in the present simulations ,",
    "this would yield a factor of @xmath249 larger @xmath0 than equation ( [ sigma_sfr_turb ] ) ; lower @xmath220 would yield even larger @xmath0 .",

    "the gravitational force on the shell , including that of the central cluster and its own self - gravity , is @xmath422 .",
    "the net acceleration of the shell is therefore @xmath423\\equiv   \\frac{(\\psi{\\varepsilon_{\\rm gmc}}-1 ) } { 2}\\frac { g{m_{\\rm gmc}}}{r^2 }   \\label{cluster_eom}\\ ] ] for @xmath424 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , this implies that there is a minimum value of @xmath425 for the pressure associated with reprocessed radiation to disrupt the cloud ; the shell can only become unbound if @xmath426 .",
    "equation ( [ cluster_eom ] ) can be integrated to obtain the asymptotic speed @xmath427^{1/2}$ ] of the shell , assuming its initial radius is @xmath412 .",
    "the resulting ratio of the momentum in the shell divided by the total mass in stars formed , representing @xmath144 for a radiation - driven shell , is @xmath428 . for any given value of @xmath429 ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the maximum momentum - to - mass ratio is obtained when @xmath430^{-1 }   \\equiv \\varepsilon_{max}$ ] . using @xmath431 @xcite for young , luminous clusters that fully sample the @xcite imf and @xmath432 for warm , dusty shells , this yields @xmath433 , @xmath434 , and @xmath435_{\\rm rad}= 0.4 ( g { m_{\\rm gmc}}/r_{cl})^{1/2}=   30 { { \\;\\rm km\\ ; s^{-1}}}({m_{\\rm gmc}}/10 ^ 6{{\\;\\rm\\,m_\\odot}})^{1/2}(r_{cl}/{{\\;\\rm\\,pc}})^{-1/2 } $ ]",
    "this is comparable to the velocity dispersion of the cluster itself , which even for the most massive clusters in starbursts does not exceed @xmath436 and is typically much lower .",
    "in addition to diffuse ( reprocessed ) radiation , streaming radiation ( dominated by uv ) from the star cluster also imparts momentum to the expanding gas cloud ( or shell ) where it is first absorbed . the maximum force from this streaming radiation",
    "is @xmath437 , such that the maximum contribution to @xmath438 is @xmath439 .",
    "thus , allowing for both reprocessed and direct stellar radiation , the value of @xmath144 from radiation - driven expanding shells is smaller than the momentum - per - stellar mass injected to the disk by radiative supernovae shells , @xmath440 .",
    "potentially , large - scale instabilities in the disk can lead to gaseous supercloud formation . how would a supercloud evolve if it is able to form ? for a spherical , uniform - density cloud of mass @xmath352 and radius @xmath353 that forms stars at a rate @xmath441 , producing a luminosity @xmath442 and a supernova rate @xmath443 , the ratio of the outward force ( due to the combined momentum input from supernovae and reprocessed radiation pressure to @xmath144 that is small compared to the contribution @xmath444 from supernovae , and thus may be neglected . ] ) to the inward force ( due to gravity ) is @xmath445.\\ ] ] the contribution to @xmath446 from supernovae declines @xmath447 as @xmath353 decreases , whereas the contribution to @xmath446 from radiation increases @xmath448 .",
    "thus , radiation forces become increasingly important as the cloud shrinks ; eventually , if @xmath446 becomes @xmath449 , inward contraction will be halted .",
    "if the star formation efficiency is sufficient , the cloud will ultimately be destroyed , with a substantial fraction of its mass once again becoming unbound ( cf . @xcite and the discussion in appendix a ) .",
    "the masses of clouds that form via gravitational instability in disks with @xmath450 are typically @xmath451 ( e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath452 for @xmath453 the gas velocity dispersion . letting @xmath454 , @xmath455 , and assuming @xmath456",

    "the force ratio has a minimum at @xmath459 , where its value is @xmath460 .",
    "taken at face value , this suggests that only disks with a sufficiently low surface density @xmath7 will form contracting superclouds , since only if @xmath461 is sufficiently small can @xmath446 be @xmath462 . with @xmath463 , @xmath464 for @xmath465 , corresponding to @xmath466 .",

    "of course , given the highly idealized assumptions adopted , the particular value obtained from this simple estimate should not be taken too seriously .",
    "physically , however , it is reasonable to expect higher-@xmath7 disks that are increasingly radiation - pressure supported to be less subject to gravitational instability , because of their stiff equation of state : if @xmath469 and @xmath470 , the internal radiation pressure in a supercloud would vary as @xmath471 .",

    "<S> star formation rates in the centers of disk galaxies often vastly exceed those at larger radii , whether measured by the surface density of star formation @xmath0 , by the star formation rate per unit gas mass , @xmath1 , or even by total output . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> supernovae are the largest contributor to the momentum flux , and turbulence provides the main pressure support for the predominantly - molecular ism . if the momentum feedback per stellar mass formed is @xmath2 , the predicted star formation rate is @xmath3 in regions where gas dominates the vertical gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this prediction with numerical simulations of vertically - resolved disks that model star formation including feedback , finding good agreement for gas surface densities in the range @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare to a compilation of star formation rates and gas contents from local and high - redshift galaxies ( both mergers and normal galaxies ) , finding good agreement provided that the conversion factor @xmath5 from integrated co emission to @xmath6 surface density decreases weakly as @xmath7 and @xmath0 increase . </S>",
    "<S> star formation rates in dense , turbulent gas are also expected to depend on the gravitational free - fall time at the corresponding mean ism density @xmath8 ; if the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is @xmath9 , the turbulent velocity dispersion driven by feedback is expected to be @xmath10 , relatively independent of @xmath7 or @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> turbulence - regulated starbursts ( controlled by kinetic momentum feedback ) are part of the larger scheme of self - regulation ; primarily - atomic low-@xmath7 outer disks may have star formation regulated by uv heating feedback , whereas regions at extremely high @xmath7 may be regulated by feedback of stellar radiation that is reprocessed into trapped ir . </S>"
