    "we consider the dynamics of a viscous incompressible thin fluid film on the outer surface of a horizontal circular cylinder that is rotating around its axis in the presence of a gravitational field .",
    "the coating flow is generated by viscous forces due to the cylinder s surface motion relative to the fluid .",
