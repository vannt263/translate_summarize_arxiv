    "the star detector at rhic  @xcite is a large acceptance spectrometer with a very broad physics program , including precision measurements of a wide variety of strange particles .",
    "the star experimental configuration during the early years of rhic operation is shown in figure [ setup ] .",
    "for the first year of rhic running , the active detectors are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite , the central trigger barrel ( ctb ) , and the ring imaging cerenkov counter ( rich ) .",
    "the solenoidal magnet has a maximum field strength of 0.5 tesla but for the first year is run at 0.25 tesla .",
    "for operation in the second year , star will install the silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) , two forward tpcs ( ftpc ) , a time - of - flight ( tof ) patch , and 26 modules of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) , comprising 22% of the full barrel emc which will be completed by 2003 .",
    "details on the acceptance of the various detector components relevant for strange particle reconstruction are given in the following section .",
    "rhic began operations for physics in the summer of 2000 . together with the other rhic experiments , star observed collisions immediately .",
    "the quality of track reconstruction in the tpc is high and efforts to understand and quantify the tracking efficiency are underway .",
    "the performance of the star tpc is illustrated in figure  [ tpcperformance ] .",
    "the left panel shows the specific ionization ( truncated mean de / dx ) in the tpc for au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev , as a function of track momentum .",
    "the curves are the bethe - bloch parameterization of de / dx .",
    "the bands for pions , kaons , protons , deuterons and electrons are visible .",
    "the relative de / dx resolution is approaching the design goal of 8% .",
    "the left panel shows the momentum resolution of the tpc as a function of momentum for charged tracks from cosmic rays that have been independently reconstructed in the upper and lower halves of the tpc in a 0.5 tesla magnetic field .",
    "the solid curve labelled `` cdr '' is the design goal , with the difference from measurement due in large part to known instrumental effects that have since been rectified .",
    "the response of the star trigger detectors ( zdc and ctb ) to au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev is shown in figure  [ startrigger ] , under the condition that both zdc signals are above a threshold .",
    "the vertical axis is the summed pulse height of all ctb slats and horizontal axis is the summed pulse height of the two zdcs .",
    "the zdc measures forward - going neutrons ( @xmath1 mrad ) and its response contains contributions from both nuclear collisions and mutual coulomb dissociation  @xcite ( the latter process does not generate tracks at mid - rapidity and is not visible in the figure ) . for nuclear collisions",
    ", low zdc response corresponds to a low number of spectator neutrons , which can occur for both very peripheral and very central collisions , whereas the ctb signal increases monotonically with increasing multiplicity at mid - rapidity .",
    "thus , the most central nuclear collisions correspond to low zdc and high ctb response ( corresponding to high multiplicity at mid - rapidity ) .",
    "the trigger inefficiency for central collisions due to the coincidence condition applied to the zdcs was measured to be much less than 1% .",
    "the rich is a proximity - focusing ring imaging cerenkov counter for identifying charged hadrons at high momentum within an acceptance of 10 msr at y@xmath2=0 , and was developed as a joint project with the alice collaboration .",
    "rings with the expected photon yields have been observed in the rich for au+au collisions .    in summary ,",
    "the star detector for the first year of rhic operation is performing extremely well , and we expect many physics results from this first round of data taking .",
    "by virtue of its large tracking acceptance and the ability to perform particle identification over a wide kinematic range , star is well suited to measuring a variety of strange particles .",
    "table [ parts ] lists the strange particles and resonances that are accessible to star and which have been studied in monte - carlo simulations .",
    "based on the result of these simulations we discuss the expected reconstruction performance of the star detector for various strange particle measurements .",
