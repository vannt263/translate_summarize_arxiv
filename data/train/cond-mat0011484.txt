    "the dynamics of the system is assumed to be dominated by two - particle collisions , modeled by their asymptotic states : a collision is characterized by the velocities before and after the contact , and the contact is assumed to be instantaneous . in the simplest model",
    ", one describes inelastic collisions by normal restitution @xmath0 only . however , surface roughness is important @xcite , since it allows for an exchange of translational and rotational energy .",
    "here we briefly sketch a study of a model where a coulomb friction law with coefficient @xmath2 and a tangential restitution coefficient @xmath7 account for tangential inelasticity and friction @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the model , then we describe a mf theory for the driven granular gas of rough spheres , and finally , we compare analytical results and numerical simulations . in the conclusions we discuss possible future refinements of the computational scheme .",
    "-0.5 cm we consider @xmath8 @xmath9-dimensional spheres of mass @xmath10 and diameter @xmath11 interacting via a hard - core potential , confined on a @xmath12-dimensional ( 2d ) layer of linear size @xmath13 , with periodic boundary conditions . inelasticity and roughness are described by a normal restitution @xmath0 , a coulomb friction law with friction @xmath2 , and a tangential restitution @xmath7 which depends on @xmath0 , @xmath2 and the collision angle @xmath14 for sliding contacts and on a maximum tangential restitution @xmath1 for sticking contacts , when the tangential elasticity becomes important .",
    "when two particles @xmath15 and @xmath12 collide , their velocities after collision depend on the velocities before collision through a collision matrix whose elements depend on @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 .",
    "thus we calculate the momentum change using a model that is consistent with experimental measurements @xcite . from the momentum conservation laws for linear and angular direction , energy conservation , and coulomb s law",
    "we get the change of linear momentum of particle @xmath15 as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the change of the normal component of the relative velocity depends on the normal restitution @xmath0 , which is a tunable parameter , while the change of the tangential component of the relative velocity depends on by the tangential restitution coefficient @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the coefficient of maximum tangential restitution , @xmath17.the quantity @xmath18 is determined using coulomb s law such that for solid spheres @xmath19 with the collision angle @xmath20 @xcite . here ,",
    "we simplified the tangential contacts in the sense that exclusively coulomb - type interactions , i.e. @xmath21 is limited by @xmath22 , or sticking contacts with the maximum tangential restitution @xmath1 are allowed @xcite .",
    "-0.5 cm we start from the results of huthmann and zippelius @xcite for a freely cooling gas of infinitely rough particles . here",
    "we apply their mf theory to the case of a driven gas of rough particles , which is the most common experimental situation @xcite .",
    "the mf kinetic theory of huthmann and zippelius is formulated for a gas of rough particles with _ constant _ tangential restitution @xmath7 , corresponding to the limit @xmath23 in our model .",
    "it is based on a pseudo  liouville  operator formalism and on the assumption of a homogeneous state , with a gaussian probability distribution of translational and rotational energies .",
    "the main outcome of this approach is a set of coupled evolution equations for the translational and rotational temperatures @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite . here , we write down and solve the mf equations for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for a granular gas of rough particles in which the translational velocities are subjected to a random uncorrelated gaussian driving of variance @xmath26 .",

    "the used simplifying approach ( @xmath51 ) ignores the fluctuations of @xmath7 due to its dependence on the rotational degree of freedom , and we expect that it is correct only in some trivial limiting cases .",
    "nevertheless , this simple approximation allows us to realize that for @xmath52 , corresponding to many experiments , simulations fit well with the modified mf theory , as we will se below .",

    "for negative @xmath1 , agreement with mf is observed for the translational temperature , while the rotational temperature shows deviations from scaling in the transient phase , although the equilibrium value fits well with mf , for @xmath63 .",

    "we obtain for @xmath1 near to unity significant deviations from mean field theory , while for negative @xmath1 the agreement with mean field theory is very good .",
