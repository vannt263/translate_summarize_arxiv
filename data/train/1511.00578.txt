    "equation ( 20 ) provides a _ necessary _ condition for broadband transparency , since it ensures transparency at resonance @xmath82 .",

    "the parameter @xmath91 entering in eq.(22 ) can be taken arbitrarily , and its inverse @xmath92 basically determines the characteristic length of nonlinear interaction .",
    "for such a profile of @xmath10 , exact solution for the optical bloch equations ( 11 ) can be obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite , and the transparency at special values of the amplitudes @xmath93 satisfying the area condition ( 20 ) can be explained in term of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite . assuming a medium length @xmath6 such that @xmath94 , the nonlinear correction @xmath72 to the transmission coefficient @xmath95 can be obtained in a closed form and reads explicitly @xmath96 where we have set @xmath97 @xmath98 is the area ( defined by eq.(19 ) with @xmath99 ) , and @xmath100 is the gamma function . from eq.(23 )",
    "the spectral transmittance @xmath101 for the signal wave can be calculated , which reads @xmath102 where @xmath103 is given by eq.(24 ) .",
    "note that broadband transparency @xmath104 is obtained provided that @xmath105 with @xmath81 integer , according to eq.(20 ) .",
    "once the normalized spatial profile @xmath106 of the qpm grating is designed according to @xmath107 , from eqs.(7 ) and ( 12 ) it follows that the transparency condition @xmath105 is met for special values of the pump amplitude @xmath41 . in terms of the intensity @xmath108 of the strong pump wave ,",
    "the transparency condition is satisfied provided that @xmath109 , where @xmath81 is an integer number and @xmath110 is the transparency pump intensity given by @xmath111 for a pump intensity @xmath112 , the nonlinear medium is broadband transparent , i.e. no sfg wave is generated at the output of the crystal for any arbitrarily broadband incident signal pulse .",
    "in fact , once the area condition ( 20 ) is satisfied the transparency bandwidth is in principle infinite according to eq.(25 ) . in practice , however , deviations of the profile of the effective susceptibility from the ideal sech shape or pump intensity deviations from the transparency value result in the appearance of a spectral region around the phase matching condition where the transmittance is not unitary . for example , if the pump intensity @xmath113 is close to but slightly detuned from the transparency value @xmath110 , according to eq.(25 ) transparency is not observed in a spectral region with a bandwidth @xmath114 determined by the condition @xmath115 , i.e. by the group velocity mismatch and interaction length @xmath116 [ see eq.(24 ) ] .",

    "this is shown by curves 1,3 , and 5 in fig.2(a ) , where the spectral transmittance shows a dip near the wavelength of perfect phase matching .",
    "the central wavelength of the dip and its width are determined by the phase matching condition in the nonlinear interaction , i.e. by the qpm grating period , the decay length @xmath152 of the qpm grating , and the material dispersion . as the ratio @xmath153 is an integer number ( curves 2 and 4 in fig.2 ) , there is no sfg wave , i.e. the medium in transparent for the signal wave according to the theoretical analysis .",

    "<S> suppression of wave scattering and the realization of transparency effects in engineered optical media and surfaces have attracted great attention in the past recent years . in this work the problem of transparency is considered for optical wave propagation in a nonlinear dielectric medium with second - order @xmath0 susceptibility . because of nonlinear interaction , a reference signal wave at carrier frequency @xmath1 can exchange power , thus being amplified or attenuated , when phase matching conditions are satisfied and frequency conversion takes place . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , rather generally the medium is not transparent to the signal wave because of scattering in the frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that broadband transparency , corresponding to the full absence of frequency conversion in spite of phase matching , can be observed for the signal wave in the process of sum frequency generation whenever the effective susceptibility @xmath0 along the nonlinear medium is tailored following a suitable spatial apodization profile and the power level of the pump wave is properly tuned . while broadband transparency is observed under such conditions , the nonlinear medium is not invisible owing to an additional effective dispersion for the signal wave introduced by the nonlinear interaction . </S>"
