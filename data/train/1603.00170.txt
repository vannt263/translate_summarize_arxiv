    "the tail was seen to point away from the sun and hence the notion of radiation pressure was born . with the advent of coherent light sources , many groups began to make heavy use of optical forces experimentally .",

    ", it is also possible to change the material of the particles to be trapped , thereby reducing the difficulties associated with trapping submicron particles .",
    "for example , higher index particles , such as gold nanoparticles @xcite are excellent candidates for nanoscale trapping but have associated problems with heat generation . other high index particles such as nanodiamonds @xcite and titania particles @xcite are also easier to trap ; however , biologically - relevant materials typically have low refractive indices , thereby negating the trapping advantages associated with higher index particles .    in this article",
    ", we discuss a nanostructured , evanescent optical trapping device based on the combination of a slot waveguide with a micro - nanofiber ( mnf ) @xcite .",
    "mnfs are extremely versatile due to their compact size , enabling them to be integrated noninvasively into many systems , such as optical tweezers @xcite and cold atom clouds @xcite .",
    "when light propagates through an mnf , a significant portion of the electric field exists outside the waveguide as an evanescent component , allowing for easy interaction between the guided light field and the surrounding medium .",
    "we work with a nanostructured mnf with an overall waist of 1.4 @xmath0 m guiding light with a wavelength of 980 nm .",
    "previously , unmodified mnfs have been used for various experimental configurations such as ( i ) optical trapping of dielectric particles @xcite , ( ii ) cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) using single quantum emitters @xcite , ( iii ) light coupling in and out of whispering gallery resonators @xcite , and ( iv ) trapping and probing cold atomic systems @xcite or atomic vapors @xcite .",
    "more recently , mnfs have been modified to increase their versatility across a range of fields , through , for example , the incorporation of snom tips @xcite or extraordinary transmission apertures @xcite .",

    "laser powers of 250 - 300 mw provided stable trapping against a constant fluid flow .",
    "the high refractive index contrast between the si slot and the surrounding water , along with the small slot separation ( @xmath1100 nm ) , produced a quasi - te mode with a large field discontinuity across the boundary that was used for trapping .",

    "the field within the slot can be up to 1.7 times higher than the field at the outer fiber surfaces although variations in the stof dimensions can drastically alter this .",
    "the origin is taken to be at the center of the slot . ]",
    "the slotted tapered optical fiber ( stof ) used in this work is a device which exploits the overlapping evanescent fields of a slot waveguide - like structure to further enhance its trapping ability , both for atoms @xcite and submicron particle trapping .",
    "we sought to create an entirely fiber - based trapping device using evanescent fields to localize particles with a high degree of control in regimes inaccessible to standard mnfs .",
    "a nanoscale slot is introduced at the waist of an mnf using focused ion beam ( fib ) milling , thereby creating a slot waveguide - like region where the optical forces are greatly enhanced .",
    "this provides three dimensional confinement within a small trapping volume , while also providing the potential for one dimensional position control of the trapped particles along the slot through the use of a sliding standing wave , i.e. a particle conveyor belt @xcite . here",
    ", we demonstrate trapping of 200 nm silica particles using a stof . we also show how light transmitted through the fiber pigtails either side of the stof can be analyzed to determine the trap characteristics .",
    "finite element method ( fem ) and finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) simulations are used to simulate the stof modes and these are subsequently used to model the forces acting on the particles using perturbative and energy density methods .",
    "commercial optical fibers guide light in what is known as the weakly - guided regime , wherein the refractive index contrast between the core of the fiber and the surrounding cladding is quite low ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "most of the light is contained within an area defined by the mode field diameter , which is much smaller than the fiber s total cross - sectional area .",
    "when an optical fiber is tapered over a heat source such that its diameter is close to , or below , the wavelength of the guided light , the distinction between the core and cladding region is no longer valid .",
    "the surrounding medium ( in our case , water ) becomes the new cladding and the original cladding is now viewed as the core material .",
    "these mnfs operate in the strongly guided regime as the refractive index contrast becomes high . the evanescent fields produced in mnfs",
    "extend far when compared to the waveguide dimensions into the surrounding medium and can interact with particles located at several 100s of nm from the fiber s surface .",
    "we work with optical fibers which have been tapered using a heat - and - pull method so that the waist diameter is typically of the order of the wavelength @xcite.we used a hydrogen - oxygen flame mixed in a 2:1 ratio to provide a clean - burning source .",
    "the untapered optical fiber is stripped of its outer acrylic layer and clamped to the stages then placed into the flame .",
    "the stages pull both sides of the fiber away from the flame , causing the fiber , which is now in a molten state , to taper . by controlling the speed of the stages",
    ", the length of the pull , and the flame size , mnfs with specified diameters can be produced .",
    "the mnfs were fabricated from single - mode optical fiber in the 9801600 nm regime .",
    "slotted tapered optical fibers , or stofs , are nanostructured mnfs which have had a section of their waist removed .",
    "the slotted tapered optical fibers were created using a three step process which involved the initial mnf fabrication process using standard heat - and - pull techniques , an indium tin oxide ( ito ) sputter coating process , and finally a focused ion beam milling process to introduce a slot to the mnf .",
    "a 5 nm layer of ito is necessary to provide sufficient charge mitigation at the mnf surface as an uncoated mnf would be subject to large dielectric charging effects during the fib process , thereby making the subsequent etching of submicron features impossible .",
    "this new technique enables us to write high resolution structures directly onto the mnf in a transmission - preserving , three - step process .",
    "the stof geometry is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .          as expected ,",
    "the electric fields of a stof differ greatly from those of a typical tapered fiber .",
    "due to the physical asymmetry introduced to the mnf at the slot region , the polarization of the guided light plays a larger role in the field distribution . to maximize the field at the slot , the polarization must be perpendicular to the walls of the slotted region .",
    "this removes the continuity requirement of the electric field at the dielectric boundary , thereby allowing a large portion of the field to exist outside of the waveguide ( see fig.[fig : fig1](d ) ) .",
    "the strength of the field at the slotted region depends on a number of parameters : the diameter , the slot width , the polarization and the wavelength of the guided light .",
    "we chose a 1.4 @xmath0 m fiber waist with a slot width of 300 nm .",
    "in general , the field strength increases with decreasing slot size , but , since we have an additional requirement that the stof opening must be large enough to facilitate the entry of submicron particles , the slot width used was the minimal possible while still being practical for particle trapping . when the slot region is excited by the fundamental mode of an mnf , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) inset ( i ) , a fundamental type mode is excited in either section , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) inset ( ii ) .",
    "slot waveguides can exhibit symmetric or anti - symmetric modes depending on the phase difference between the upper and lower sections .",
    "the fundamental mode of an mnf has an approximately uniform phase front , so we neglect the possibility of anti - symmetric modes in the following discussion .      optical trapping forces are typically divided into two categories in optical trapping experiments . in the dipole approximation ,",
    "where @xmath3k a \\ll 1 $ ] where @xmath4 is the wave number ( i.e. @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 is the radius of the particle , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the refractive indices of the particle and medium , respectively , the force can be decomposed into the gradient force ( @xmath9 ) and the scattering force ( @xmath10 ) @xcite , where @xmath11 is the real component of the polarizability of the particle , * e * is the electric field , and _ i_(*r * ) is the optical intensity .",
    "this formalism is not necessarily accurate for all particle sizes , but gives a qualitative and intuitive picture of how the local electric fields affect particles placed within them .    for the case of unidirectional excitation of a stof waveguide , the gradient force , which seeks to pull particles towards regions of high intensity , draws particles towards the walls at the center of the slot , while the scattering force propels particles in the direction of propagation of the trapping laser field . to produce a trap with longitudinal confinement ,",
    "a standing wave is necessary .",
    "this provides an extra degree of confinement for the particles , as well as increasing the overall trap efficiency due to the cancellation of the scattering force components , thereby improving the axial trapping strength .",
    "a more in - depth analysis of the trap is made using a combination of fdtd / fem models and various optical trapping models .",
    "we introduced a low density nanoparticle solution between the water immersion 63x lens and the stof , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the low density solution was used to prevent large numbers of particles occluding the slot .",
    "we used a particle solution of approximately @xmath12 particles / ml , equivalent to an average particle occupancy of @xmath1 1 over the volume of the slot .",
    "fluorescent nanoparticles were used to increase visibility of the system and we collected data visually , using a high sensitivity , fluorescence camera .",
    "transmission and fluorescence data were also collected through the fiber using either a photodiode ( for transmission ) or a single photon counting module ( for fluorescence ) .",
    "polarization preparation of light in an mnf is often a source of contention as temperature and pressure variations ( i.e. stresses and strains ) along the fiber can cause the polarization to rotate , leading to little correlation between the input and output polarization states .",
    "because of this behavior , polarization measurement methods , such as the observation of rayleigh scattering along the fiber waist , need to be used @xcite . in our experiment , we counter - propagated 980 nm light from a ti : sapphire laser through the stof to provide a 3-dimensional trapping potential .",
    "the standing wave pattern that was set up within the wave guiding structure extended to the evanescent field , which then interacted with nearby particles to produce a periodic potential within the cavity section of the stof .",
    "two half - wave plates placed in the path of the two beams gave us fine control over the input polarization states . by monitoring the output at opposite ends of the stof",
    ", we obtained an estimate for the polarization at the slot .",
    "however , by directly monitoring the slot region using a 63x water immersion objective lens , we were better able to determine the polarization state at the stof region via the intensity of the scattered light . when the light was polarized perpendicular to the plane of the slot i.e. along the _",
    "y_-axis , scattering was further enhanced due to the increased fraction of light contained within the small region .",
    "the slot is viewed in the _",
    "yz_-plane where the full slot opening is observed to ensure that the maximum scattering is at the correct polarization state .",
    "a thorough calculation of the electric fields , using both fdtd and fem methods , provided us with reliable estimates for the optical forces in the stof system .",
    "the optical fields of the device were calculated both in the presence of , and without , the particles to be trapped .",
    "optical forces on small particles are often described using the dipole approximation , where the size of the particle must be much less than the wavelength of the trapping beams . for 200 nm particles",
    "this criterion is not quite satisfied . to this end",
    ", we sought to make a comparison between the dipole gradient and scattering forces , and the more standard methods of force calculation for medium - sized particles .",
    "the total optical force in mid - sized optical trapping systems , @xmath13 , is often calculated using a surface integral of the dot product of the maxwell stress tensor , * t * , with the surface normal , * n * , such that @xmath14    here , @xmath15 is the unit area element .",
    "while this is an accurate method , it can be somewhat difficult to implement when the boundary of the system is ill - defined due to the mesh shape and/or the step size of the fem / fdtd method used . as an alternative , we used an equivalent form derived from the minkowski formalism for calculating the force ; this method relies on the gradient of the electric permittivity , a value which can be easily extracted from the optical force calculation @xcite , such that the force is given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath18 is the relative permittivity , * e * is the electric field and @xmath19 is the unit volume element . accepted values of the refractive indices of silica and polystyrene at a wavelength of 980 nm were used in all calculations .",
    "the effect of the 5 nm layer of indium tin oxide was ignored due to its negligible influence on the mnf modes .",
    "force measurements using data from the fdtd and fem methods give almost identical results for the trapping forces within the slot except near the slot walls where a maximum discrepancy of 7.6% was found .",
    "we assume this discrepancy to be associated with the dynamic meshing of the fem . to achieve similar resolution near the boundaries of the slot walls in an fdtd calculation , a significant increase in computation time would be required .",
    "the dipole approximation for the force calculation proved unreliable in regions where the local gradient was insignificant , but became more accurate as this gradient increased .",
    "this method could be improved by considering the particle as a distributed dipole , but this treatment is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "fdtd images of the optical fields of the stof are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , and a comparison of the trapping forces for different particle locations inside the slot are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . considering the close agreement between the fdtd and fem simulations , we chose to largely model the system using the fdtd method due to the reduced memory requirements and regular grid pattern .",
    "the dipole approximation ,    @xmath20    was also used to provide a contrast to the force calculation using the minkowski formalism .",

    "[ fig : fig3](c ) .",
    "the trapping forces along the directions which run parallel to the stof wall ( along the _ x_- and _ z_-axes ) are considered to have normal restoring forces , but the trap which runs perpendicularly ( along the _",

    "instead , we determined the gradient of the force in this direction , indicated by @xmath22 in table [ tab : trapstiff ] .",
