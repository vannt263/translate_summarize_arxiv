    "the dynamic synergy between observation , theory , and experiment developed over many years around the field of @xmath3-ray astronomy has as its ultimate goal observations of specifc radionuclides informing our understanding of stellar explosions and the theoretical models that predict nucleosynthesis .",
    "of the radioactive species observed so far , the most long lived , @xmath9al and @xmath10fe ( with half - lives @xmath11 and @xmath12 yr , respectively ) , are in reasonably good agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "observations of those in the iron group , @xmath13ni ( @xmath14 d and @xmath15 hr , respectively ) and their decay products @xmath13co ( @xmath16 d and @xmath17d , respectively ) , are used in many ways to constrain our current models of the core collapse explosion mechanism .",
    "the radionuclide @xmath0ti ( @xmath18 yr ) , made in the same explosive environment but in much lower amounts compared to the very abundant nickle isotopes @xcite , is hoped to one day serve as an even more sensitive diagnostic and a valuable probe of the conditions extant in some of the deepest layers to be ejected .",
    "observationally most of the attention has focused on the detection of the 68 , 78 , and 1157 kev @xmath3-rays from the @xmath0ti @xmath19 @xmath0sc @xmath19 @xmath0ca decay chain ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the 1157 kev @xmath3-ray has been observed directly from a point source in cassiopeia a ( cas a ; iyudin et  al . 1994 ) .",
    "this was later confirmed by observation of the low - energy @xmath0sc @xmath3-rays using the @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite observatories . using values for the distance , age , and @xmath3-flux of cas a",
    ", the amount of @xmath0ti ejected was found to be 1.6@xmath22 @xmath2310@xmath24 m@xmath25 @xcite , in agreement with earlier observations using cgro @xcite .",
    "although the presence of @xmath0ti is currently below detection limits in sn1987a in the nearby large magellanic cloud , its light curve is theorized to now be powered by the decay of @xmath0ti .",
    "the yield of @xmath0ti in sn1987a has been estimated from its light curve to be @xmath26 , a factor of 3 greater than predicted by models @xcite . a third @xmath0ti source ( of lower significance compared to the one in casa )",
    "has been observed in the vela region @xcite but the existence of a co - located young supernova ( sn ) remnant has not been confirmed .",
    "while the mass of @xmath0ti observed in sn remnants appears to be underproduced by past models , the number of observed sources of @xmath0ti in all - sky surveys appears to be less than expected from estimates of the galactic sn rate and the known @xmath0ti half life , leading some to question whether @xmath0ti - producing sne are exceptional @xcite .",
    "theoretically , @xmath0ti production is traditionally ascribed to regions experiencing a strong `` @xmath6rich freeze out '' , where material initially in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) at relatively low density is cooled so rapidly that free @xmath6particles do not have time to reassemble , through inefficient @xmath27body reactions that span the mass gaps at a=5 and a=8 , back into the iron group .",
    "a likely scenario is material in or near the silicon shell as it experiences shock wave passage during a core collapse sn event . assuming the material cools adiabatically over a hydrodynamic timescale ( @xmath28 ) , where @xmath29 is a scaling parameter ( here unity ) and @xmath30 is the initial ( peak ) density in g @xmath31 , initial conditions that would result in a final @xmath2-particle mass fraction of @xmath32 1% would require temperatures high enough to ensure nse ( @xmath33 ) and an initial density @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this translates to a radiation entropy greater than unity ( section 3.2 ) .    in models of massive stars",
    "the @xmath6rich freeze out dominates the solar production of several species , including @xmath0ca ( made as ti ) , @xmath35sc , @xmath36fe ( made as ni ) , and @xmath37ni , while still others seem to require a sizable component to account for their solar abundances , including @xmath38cr , @xmath39co , @xmath40ni , and @xmath41zn @xcite .",
    "although @xmath42ni is the dominant species produced in both nse and the @xmath6rich freez out over a wide range ( @xmath43 ) of neutron excess @xcite , the solar abundance of @xmath42fe is dominated by production in explosive silicon burning in massive stars and by a large contribution from sne ia @xcite .    in order to address one aspect of the model uncertainties associated with the theoretical predictions of @xmath0ti in sne , we focus on exploring the nuclear data uncertainties of two key reaction rates .",
    "experimentally we address the @xmath1ca(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath0ti cross section where the existing experimental results are inconsistent and theoretical estimates are complicated by the suppression of @xmath44 @xmath45 gamma transitions in self - conjugate ( @xmath46 = @xmath47 ) nuclei @xcite .",
    "this cross section has been measured in the past using several techniques .",
    "@xcite used in - beam @xmath3-ray spectroscopy to measure the capture of @xmath2-particles on a metallic calcium target in the center - of - mass energy range @xmath48 mev . in that work the excitation function for the 1083 kev first excited state transition in @xmath0ti was determined and the resonance strengths were developed .",
    "@xcite determined the integral cross section in the range @xmath49 mev by bombarding a he gas target with a @xmath1ca beam and collecting the recoiling @xmath0ti in a catcher foil .",
    "accelerator mass spectroscopy was then used to determine the ratio of @xmath0ti / ti from the known content of ti in the catcher foil . recently",
    ", a slightly broader energy range of @xmath50 mev was explored using the dragon recoil mass spectrometer @xcite in inverse kinematics .",
    "they developed individual resonances whose sum was used to determine a reaction rate for @xmath51 . yet despite these often heroic expenditures of time , toil , and treasure , in the temperature range of astrophysical interest there still exists a factor of 3 or more difference between the experimentally determined reaction rates .    in this work",
    ", we develop the cross section for @xmath1ca(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath0ti by two separate methods as a check on systematic uncertainties .",
    "first we used in - beam @xmath3-ray spectroscopy to measure a thick target yield of the @xmath1ca(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath0ti reaction .",
    "we then determined the number of @xmath0ti nuclei produced by counting low - energy @xmath3-rays from the decay of @xmath0ti in an irradiated target .",
    "special attention was devoted to checking the internal consistency of the measurements and to establishing realistic uncertainties in developing the stellar reaction rate from a combination of experimental and theoretical cross sections .",
    "we have made a similar evaluation of the stellar reaction rate for the dominant destruction reaction , @xmath0ti(@xmath2,@xmath7)@xmath8v , based on the original experimental work of @xcite and the theoretical cross section work of @xcite .",
    "our results are presented in four parts . in section 2",
    ", we describe our experimental efforts .",
    "section 3 then discusses the development of stellar reaction rates , and an expose of the past and present experimental and theory efforts for the two rates in question . in section 4 , we present nucleosynthesis results for the production of @xmath0ti and @xmath52ni reported in previous surveys of massive star evolution .",
    "we then carry out a sensitivity survey of @xmath0ti to variations in the principle production and destruction rates using more recent sn models .",
    "in section 5 we provide a discussion and conclusions .",
    "the @xmath1ca(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath0ti reaction was measured at the lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) center for accelerator mass spectroscopy ( cams ) using a 10 mv fn tandem van de graaff accelerator . to calibrate the beam energy a silicon detector was placed in a low current beam and the measured energy",

    "thermonuclear reaction rates are obtained through integration of the energy - dependent cross section weighted by a maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) particle distribution @xcite . for reaction @xmath108 @xmath109 where @xmath110 is avagadro s number , @xmath111 is the reduced mass of the target and incident projectile in atomic mass units , @xmath112 is an index representing bound states in the target and product nuclei ( @xmath113 for the ground state , 1 for first excited , etc . ) , and @xmath114 is the relative velocity of the @xmath2-particle ( @xmath115 ) and the target ( @xmath116 ) in cm s@xmath117 . the cross section @xmath118 is expressed in barns , @xmath119 is the center of mass energy of the @xmath2-particle and the target in mev , @xmath120 is the temperature in billions of degrees kelvin , and the reaction rate has units of @xmath121 mole@xmath117 s@xmath117 .",
    "there are two important issues regarding the cross section @xmath118 used in the integration and its relation to the experimental cross section .",
    "first , when computing _ astrophysically relevant _ reaction rates , the cross section has to be the one for a thermally excited target nucleus in the plasma .",
    "only such a stellar cross section allows application of detailed balance to derive the reverse rate @xcite .",
    "laboratory cross sections are measured with the target nucleus in the ground state only and the correction , or stellar enhancement factor , has to be calculated from theory .",
    "for the @xmath1ca(@xmath122)@xmath0ti and @xmath0ti(@xmath123)@xmath8v reactions the correction factors are unity over the entire temperature range of interest @xcite .",
    "therefore the cross section @xmath118 is identical to the cross section @xmath92 appearing in eq .",
    "[ theoryyield ] .",
    "second , the question arises as to how well the reaction rate is constrained by the experimental cross section data . in the rare case of a thick target yield measurement that completely samples the relevant stellar temperature range , a direct calculation of the thermonuclear reaction rate",
    "can be obtained by introducing a simple change of variable and combining eq.s [ theoryyield ] and [ eq : reacrate ] @xcite .",
    "more often limitations of the experimental apparatus and/or beam time allotment restricts the measurement of cross section data to a fairly narrow energy range . to produce a reaction rate spanning a realistic temperature range for stellar synthesis , one often has to supplement the experimental results with theory cross section values to perform the integration in eq .",
    "[ eq : reacrate ] .",
    "the integrand exhibits a maximum contributing most to the reaction rate due to the folding of the energy - dependences of the cross section and the mb distribution .",
    "conventionally , the location and width of this gamow peak are estimated by multiplying a coulomb barrier penetration factor with the high - energy tail of the mb distribution or by considering a gaussian approximation to it ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is applicable for capture reactions only as long as the @xmath3-width is larger than the charged particle width @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath2 width is changing rapidly with energy due to the coulomb barrier , this prerequisite may only be fulfilled at very low projectile energies which effectively shifts the gamow window to lower energies than expected from the standard approximation formula .",
    "figure [ fig : gamowca40ag ] confirms this by showing the `` true '' gamow window at @xmath124 and @xmath125 in comparison to the peaks obtained from the standard formula and its approximation for the @xmath1ca(@xmath122)@xmath0ti and @xmath0ti(@xmath123)@xmath8v reactions . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : gamow2exp ] compares the energy range spanned by our experimental data with the true gamow window for stellar temperatures @xmath126 .",
    "the width of the window is defined such that filling the `` window '' with experimental data would determine the reaction rate to 10% accuracy .",
    "the minimum temperature at which an experiment can fully inform the reaction rate is the overlap of the full width of the window and the range of experimental data ( shaded region ) . for the astrophysical processes considered here",
    ", the most relevant temperature range is between @xmath127 ( section 3.4 ) . a less severe situation exists for the @xmath0ti(@xmath123)@xmath8v ( figure [ fig : gamow2expb ] ) . from these figures",
    "it is evident that the limited range of experimental data collected in these two experiments do not contribute significantly to the rates in the important temperature range and that the supplemental theory cross sections at lower energies will dominate both of the rates and their uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , the data can be used to test the non - smoker predictions at higher energies .      to obtain a `` semi - experimental '' astrophysical rate for @xmath1ca(@xmath122)@xmath0ti",
    ", we normalized the non - smoker cross section by a factor of 1.71 to agree with our measured thick target yield at 5.36 mev ( figure [ thickyield ] ) .",
    "the data at this energy were chosen because the experimental result was confirmed by two independent techniques .",
    "although the errors on the experimental thick target yield are small , during the calcuation of the reaction rate we have to assign an uncertainty which is similar to the uncertainty on the theory cross section . therefore we will perform our astrophysical studies with an assigned factor of 2 uncertainty on this rate .",
    "this also accounts for a potentially different energy - dependence of the theoretical cross section , and fits well with the general factor of @xmath128 accuracy expected for global predictions of low - energy @xmath2-capture reactions on self - conjugate nuclei @xcite .",

    "the range of variation in the theory rates is also large , that of @xcite being of the order of the largest experimental results , the smallest is clearly that of @xcite .",
    "most unfortunately , the rate generated from this published fit differs from the tabulated non - smoker rate ( crosses ) by factors of 2 ( high and low ) on both ends of the important temperature range .",
    "@xcite fit this rate to an accuracy of 0.92 over the temperature range @xmath135 .",
    "in general fits to charged particle rates have larger deviations than those for neutron - induced reactions .",
    "most often a quote of low accuracy pertains to deviation at the lowest temperature points of the fit . based on arguments related to the nuclear level density and its impact on the applicability of the statistical model , @xcite",
    "suggest that the lower limit of applicability for this dominant production rate is @xmath136 , well below the important temperature range in this study . to be fair",
    "the statistical result itself could well be in error by a factor of 2 or more due to the uncertainty in the global @xmath137nucleus optical potential , and the fit does agree at @xmath138 , which is close to the midway point of @xmath0ti production in several of the scenarios studied in the next section .",
    "we have re - fit this rate ( dotted line in the inset ) , and observe that over the important temperature range it now differs from the non - smoker rate by no more that 12% ( typically better than 5% ) .",

    "these translate to higher entropies ( approaching 50 at @xmath210 , @xmath211 g @xmath31 ) , but the temperature is dropping so fast that nse ( needed to make @xmath42ni ) will be increasingly hard to achieve . for these peak conditions , assuming @xmath212 and our recommended principal production and destruction rates , the final @xmath2 , @xmath0ti , and @xmath52ni mass fractions are @xmath213 , @xmath214 , 0.38 , 0.03 , and 0.08 respectively , leading to npf s @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 .",

    "@xmath189 is straight forward to understand . in general",
    ", the value of @xmath189 tends to steer the net nuclear flows along pathways that are either proton - rich ( @xmath218 ) or neutron - rich ( @xmath219 ) . since @xmath0ti and @xmath42ni both have @xmath220",
    ", expansions of material that deviate far from this will reflect a drop in the abundance of each , although for @xmath42ni , which is made in nse , the change will be less dramatic , especially for proton - rich conditions @xcite . for all three points ( casa 1 - 3 ) the principle production rate affecting @xmath0ti for all values of @xmath189 explored is @xmath1ca(@xmath122)@xmath0ti .",
    "differences in @xmath184 across the range of @xmath189 surveyed are therefore driven principally by the reactions affecting the production of @xmath1ca and the destruction of @xmath0ti .",
    "for @xmath221 the dominant sequence of reactions producing @xmath1ca are @xmath2-capture reactions on self - conjugate nuclei up to @xmath222ar followed by @xmath222ar(@xmath123)@xmath223k(@xmath160)@xmath1ca , operating principally between @xmath224 .",
    "this is also true for @xmath218 , but proton - induced ( @xmath160 ) and ( @xmath225 ) flows provide additional pathways to build up @xmath226ca at the expense of @xmath1ca .",
    "proton - capture reactions also compete strongly with @xmath0ti(@xmath123)@xmath8v to accelerate the depletion of @xmath0ti over the same temperature range . for @xmath227 proton - induced reactions that produce @xmath1ca and destroy @xmath0ti",
    "are suppressed due to the lower free proton abundance , the ones affecting production win out .    as mentioned above , the error bars on each point represent the variation in @xmath184 due to the many choices of @xmath1ca(@xmath122)@xmath0ti reaction rate we considered . for point casa-3",
    "this amounted to roughly 20% deviations from our  recommended result  , most often bracketed by our @xmath228 upper and lower error bar .",
    "considering only the rates from other efforts , the variation would have been + 20% and -10% from our recommended value .",
    "the variation is asymetric due to the relative ratios of the various production rates versus ours which was used to anchor the central point ( see inset of figure [ ca40ag_rates ] ) . if instead of the factor of 2 errors we assumed for the supplemental theory cross section we had used the errors suggested by our off - line counting data ( figure [ thickyield ] ) ,",
    "the variation would have been of order 2% .",
    "the choice of @xmath0ti(@xmath123)@xmath8v destruction rate exhibits a larger sensitivity ( @xmath229% ) to overall @xmath0ti synthesis than the entire spread in the experimental @xmath1ca(@xmath122)@xmath0ti production rates .",
    "taken together , the potential uncertainty over the allowed @xmath189 range in @xmath0ti synthesis encompassed by the possible choices of production and destruction rate is roughly a factor of 3 .",
    "interestingly , the dot - short - dash lines in figure [ casa_npf ] show @xmath0ti synthesis considering the use of the original published fits @xcite for both @xmath1ca(@xmath122)@xmath0ti and @xmath0ti(@xmath123)@xmath8v , in very close agreement ( @xmath230 ) with what resulted using our  recommended  rates .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath231 , the original fit to the production rate ( figure [ ca40ag_rates ] ) made _ on average _ ( more above @xmath232 , less below ) very nearly the same amount of @xmath0ti as our  recommended rate  , while the destruction rate ( figure [ ti44ap_rates ] ) was nearly identical for @xmath233 .",
    "our higher production rate below @xmath232 accounted for the uniformly higher production .",
    "again , this is the same level of variation from our recommended rate that would have occurred if we had considered only our offline counting error ( table [ thickyield ] ) .",
    "this would also be the result obtained using the default bdat reaction rate library provided with the torch reaction network code ( timmes 2010 , private communication ) , since it utilizes the same ( original ) fits to the relevant hauser - feshbach theory rates @xcite and @xmath157 reaction rate @xcite .",
    "figure [ 2dex_npf ] shows our results for points 2dexpl @xmath183 ( table [ nuc_survey ] ) drawn from conditions in a rotating two - dimensional sn explosion model .",
    "these have the same peak temperature albeit at higher peak density , as the points drawn from the casa model , and sample the same regions as depicted in @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath185 , and @xmath186 are very similar to those from the model for casa ( i.e. production compared to solar iron ) , but @xmath184 is much smaller for all scenarios .",
    "it is similar however to that seen in the massive star surveys ( p@xmath234 , figure [ sn2_npf_sol ] ) .",
    "the final @xmath2-particle mass fractions across the @xmath189 range illustrated were roughly 0.10 , 0.07 , and 0.06 for points 4 - 6 , respectively ( table [ nuc_survey ] ) .    according to @xcite points 2dmhd @xmath235",
    "represent conditions in a model for a rotating two - dimensional mhd star .",
    "point 7 is located in the `` chasm '' of @xmath0ti production , while point 8 is in the region defined by them as incomplete silicon burning . both experience",
    "much higher peak densities ( at identical peak temperatures ) than points from the previous two models , and consequently they have very low entropies and very short hydrodynamic time scales .",
    "results assuming our  recommended  production and destruction rates are shown in table [ nuc_survey ] .",
    "as before @xmath185 and @xmath186 are very similar to our previous results reflecting a near constant production of @xmath187ni with respect to solar iron ( for a given @xmath189 ) over the entire range of expansion timescales surveyed . however , @xmath184 was virtually non - existent , with ( @xmath205ti ) @xmath236 ( often much less ) for any @xmath189 in either expansion .",
    "considering point 7 , whose peak conditions reside in the `` chasm '' of @xmath0ti production noted in @xcite , our  recommended  reaction rates would slightly lessen ( by 4% ) the `` depth '' of the chasm compared to the reaction rates they used .",
    "the explanation for the drop in @xmath184 stems from the lower entropy ( higher peak density ) for each point in these rotating two - dimensional explosion model expansions versus those from the model for casa ( see table [ nuc_survey ] ) .",
    "similarly , for all three casa points , the lower entropy expansions translated into a lower @xmath184 ( figure [ casa_npf ] ) . at lower entropy material merges very quickly into the iron group at the expense of the @xmath2-particle abundance which at late times was so low ( @xmath237% ) in the two - dimensional explosion model expansions that few were available to make @xmath1ca at appreciable levels , with @xmath0ti being consequently even lower .    from the track of the rotating two - dimensional explosion model we chose conditions ( points 2dexpl @xmath183 ) that had identical peak densities , and hence a constant expansion timescale ( 0.14 s ) .",
    "for this factor of 2.6 overall change in entropy and for the specific case of @xmath238 , the final @xmath42ni mass fractions were 0.74 , 0.77 , and 0.77 for points 2dexpl @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "for the casa model , with a factor of 1.5 range in entropy ( that included a factor of 2 range of dynamic time - scale ) the @xmath42ni mass fractions were 0.64 , 0.62 , and 0.52 for points casa 1 - 3 , respectively .",
    "the salient point for @xmath0ti synthesis again is that the higher entropy expansions made less @xmath42ni and had more @xmath2-particles , especially at late times , that enabled the production of @xmath1ca and @xmath0ti ( table [ nuc_survey ] ) .",
    "since p@xmath208 is a ratio of ti to fe , it grows as a function of increasing entropy .",
    "we illustrate all these points graphically in figure [ 3panel_msfvst9 ] where we show the evolution of select mass fractions versus temperature for the three expansions in our survey with identical peak temperatures ( points 2 , 5 , and 8) that all started with an initial composition with @xmath239 .",
    "for each expansion both @xmath1ca and @xmath0ti achieve an nse abundance not very different from their final freeze out values , but both are effectively destroyed for @xmath240 .",
    "thereafter they are reassembled at a rate determined largely by the @xmath2-particle abundance , which is affected by the peak density ( entropy ) .",
    "it is clear that a more robust @xmath2-rich freeze out is more conducive to @xmath0ti synthesis and that reaction rates clearly matter .",
    "we also note for all conditions shown in figure [ 3panel_msfvst9 ] the freeze - out of the @xmath0ti abundance near @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath8v abundance does increase as the temperature declines , but the @xmath0ti abundance changes by less than a few percent ( the increase is due predominantly to the decay of radioactive @xmath8cr ) . at this @xmath189 and for @xmath241",
    "the dominant destruction rate for @xmath0ti is @xmath0ti(@xmath123)@xmath8v , below 1.0 it switches to @xmath0ti(@xmath160)@xmath35v .",

    "the species in the iron group are not much affected , @xmath245ni are slightly higher than unity , all others show lower production factors .",
    "the reason is that for a longer expansion timescale , the material experiences higher temperatures for a longer duration .",
    "those made dominantly in nse ( the iron group seen here ) are slightly altered due to @xmath2-particle reactions on them , which are ultimately provided by photo - disintegration and operation of the @xmath157-reaction .",

    "an off - line activation measurement using the target from the @xmath102 = 5.36 mev irradiation showed good agreement with the in - beam measurement .",

    "we then carried out a sensitivity survey of @xmath0ti nucleosynthesis in adiabatic expansions from eight peak temperature and density combinations drawn from conditions in three recent stellar explosion models @xcite .",
    "for each expansion we survey a range of initial compositions ( @xmath252 ) .",

    "the total range of sensitivity is a factor of 1.5 ( 36% ) when considering all of the production rates available .",
    "we also find that the uncertainties associated with the dominant destruction rate , @xmath0ti(@xmath123)@xmath8v , have roughly double the impact on @xmath0ti synthesis ( @xmath255 , or 70% ) than that exhibited by the entire range of production rates .",
    "we suggest the use of our re - evaluation of the only available experimental reaction rate @xcite and strongly suggest consideration of its attendant larger uncertainty ( @xmath256 ) .",
