    "the employing of non - hermitian operators for the description of experimentally observable data goes back to the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . a steady interest to non - hermitian hamiltonians became enormous after it has been discovered that complex hamiltonians possessing so - called @xmath1-symmetry ( the product of parity and time reversal ) can have a real spectrum ( like self - adjoint operators ) @xcite .",
