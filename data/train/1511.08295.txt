    "it is well known that most phenomena in pure @xmath2 gauge theories do not depend on the representations of the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "it is considered that both the fundamental and adjoint representations are equally valid representations of the non - abelian gauge fields and differences specific to representations are in general considered unphysical .",
    "the preference to a particular representation arises when the gauge fields are coupled to the matter fields . in the presence of the matter fields the two representations of the gauge fields are not equivalent . in quantum field theories such as the quantum chromodynamics @xmath3 and the electroweak @xmath4 theory , which describe the strong and electro - weak forces of nature respectively , the matter fields are in the fundamental representations .",
    "the gauge invariance of these theories requires that the gauge fields also be in the fundamental representation .",
    "given that there is a clear preference to the fundamental representation of the gauge fields , the physics aspects specific to this representation can play important role in these theories .",
    "one of the important physics issue which arises in the fundamental representation is the @xmath0 symmetry . at finite temperatures the gauge fields are periodic along the temporal direction @xcite .",
    "this boundary condition requires that in the temporal direction the gauge transformations are periodic up to a factor @xmath5 , which is an element of the center ( @xmath6 ) of the gauge group @xmath2 .",
    "a gauge transformation which is periodic upto a phase factor @xmath5 ( in the temporal direction ) non - trivially transforms the polyakov loop @xmath7 , which is the trace of a path ordered product of exponentials of the temporal gauge field @xmath8 along the shortest temporal loop .",
    "the polyakov loop picks up the element @xmath5 as a phase factor , i.e @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "all possible gauge transformations of the polyakov loop then form the @xmath0 symmetry group .",
    "this symmetry plays an important role in the finite temperature confinement - deconfinement transition in pure @xmath2 gauge theories . in the deconfined phase the polyakov loop acquires a non - zero expectation value which leads to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry . on the other hand in the confined phase it has zero expectation value .",
    "this property of the polyakov loop across the confinement - deconfinement transition makes it an ideal candidate for an order parameter for this transition@xcite .    even though the above non - periodic gauge transformations preserve the boundary conditions of the gauge fields they do not preserve the temporal boundary condition of the matter fields in the fundamental representation . after a gauge transformation for which @xmath10(@xmath11 is the identity element of @xmath0 ) bosonic(fermionic ) matter fields are no more periodic(anti - periodic ) .",
    "these gauge transformations therefore can not act on the matter fields .",
    "however it still makes sense to consider these @xmath0 gauge transformations by restricting their actions only to the gauge fields .",
    "these transformations , which are not like the conventional gauge transformations acting both on the gauge and the matter fields , will not leave the action of the full theory invariant .",
    "however a given gauge field configuration as well as it s @xmath0 transformations are both valid configurations and will contribute to the partition function of the full theory .",
    "their individual contribution to the partition function will decide the relative ",
    "boltzmann \" probability of these two configurations in a thermal ensemble .",
    "even though the classical action does not have the @xmath0 symmetry ultimately the fluctuations of the fields will decide if the @xmath0 symmetry is relevant in presence of matter fields . here by @xmath0 symmetry we imply that the gauge transformations are acting only on the gauge fields .",
    "the higgs fields can be gauge transformed only when the gauge transformations correspond to the identity of @xmath0 .",
    "the issue of @xmath0 symmetry in the presence of fundamental matter fields has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath12 perturbative effective potential for the polyakov loop has meta - stable states with negative entropy @xcite in the presence of fermions . in these studies , however , only the zero mode of the polyakov loop is coupled to the matter fields .",
    "higher modes of the polyakov loop , which actually give rise to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry , may resolve the problem of negative entropy .",
    "subsequent studies using effective models @xcite and lattice qcd studies @xcite have shown that the presence of fermions acts as an external effective field on the polyakov loop thereby breaking the @xmath0 symmetry explicitly .",
    "although there have been a lot of non - perturbative studies on the confinement - deconfinement transition of @xmath2 gauge theories coupled to fundamental bosonic fields @xcite but very few have addressed the issue of the @xmath0 symmetry in these theories . in this work",
    "we carry out non - perturbative study of the @xmath0 symmetry in the presence of bosonic matter fields in the fundamental representation .",
    "more efforts are needed to address the issues related to the @xmath0 symmetry in the presence of matter fields such as the thermodynamic properties of meta - stable states , strength of the symmetry breaking field etc . through higher order corrections to the effective potential and by non - perturbative monte carlo simulations .    to study the @xmath0 symmetry we focus mainly on the properties of the polyakov loop as it is most sensitive to this symmetry .",
    "we compute the distribution of the polyakov loop using the monte carlo simulations of the partition function .",
    "we have carried out simulations for the cases of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the distribution of the polyakov loop is found to be similar to the distribution of the magnetization in the @xmath15state potts model ( which has @xmath0 symmetry ) in the presence of the external field .",
    "the external field causes asymmetry in the distributions of the magnetization which otherwise has the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the larger the external field is larger is the asymmetry in the distribution of the magnetization . in the present case",
    "the asymmetry of the polyakov loop distribution is found to vary with the higgs condensate .",
    "it is observed that the distribution has large(small ) asymmetry when the condensate is large(small ) .",
    "these results suggest that the external field for the polyakov loop ( the @xmath0 symmetry ) depends on the higgs field .",
    "it is never expected that the external field vanish as long as there is interaction between the gauge and the higgs fields .",
    "surprisingly it is found that for a suitable choice of external parameters , when the system is in the higgs symmetric phase , the polyakov loop distribution exhibits the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the simulation results also show that the different @xmath0 states in the deconfined phase have the same free energy .",
    "this implies the vanishing of the effective external field .",
    "this occurs while there is non - zero interaction ( correlation ) between the gauge and the higgs fields . in this case",
    "the nature of the confinement - deconfinement transition is almost same as in the pure gauge case .",
    "apart from affecting the confinement - deconfinement transition the @xmath0 restoration in the theory will lead to presence of domain walls and strings defects ( @xmath16 ) at very high temperatures in the deconfined phase .",
    "previously the effective potential calculations have shown that the @xmath0 symmetry is restored only in the limit of infinitely heavy higgs mass , that is basically when the higgs field decouples from the gauge fields .",
    "in contrast in our non - perturbative studies the @xmath0 symmetry is realized even when the higgs has finite mass and its interaction with the gauge fields is non - zero .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate this symmetry in the presence of fundamental fermion fields in view of its restoration in the presence of the higgs field .",
    "we mention here that conventionally symmetry restoration means that the distribution of the order parameter ( the polyakov loop in the present context ) is symmetrically peaked around zero . in the present context by symmetry restoration",
    "we imply that the full theory exhibits the corresponding symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following in section - ii",
    "we discuss the @xmath0 symmetry in @xmath1higgs theories . in section - iii we present our numerical simulations and results . in section - iv",
    "we present our discussions and conclusions .",
    "the modified action which describes the interaction of the gauge fields and the higgs field @xmath39 is given by , @xmath40 the @xmath39 field is a @xmath41 column matrix with complex elements .",
    "@xmath42,@xmath43 are the bare mass and the self - interaction strength of the @xmath39 field respectively . the covariant derivative @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 .",
    "being a bosonic field , @xmath39 satisfies periodic boundary condition in the temporal direction , i.e @xmath46 . under a gauge transformation",
    "@xmath29 the @xmath39 field transforms as , @xmath47 it is obvious that @xmath48 is periodic only when the gauge transformations are periodic .",
    "therefore the gauge transformations which are not periodic are not allowed to act on the matter fields .",
    "thus @xmath0 group is not a symmetry of the classical action ( eq.6 ) .",
    "however the actual manifestation of the @xmath0 symmetry can be seen only after the fluctuations of the gauge and matter fields are included as fluctuations play dominant role in these theories .",
    "the change in the action due @xmath0 transformation acting only on the gauge fields can be compensated by fluctuations of the higgs field .",
    "this leads to the complete realization / restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry . in the following",
    "we describe the numerical monte carlo simulations and results .",
    "in the monte carlo simulations of @xmath49 model , the @xmath50dimensional euclidean space is replaced by a discrete lattice .",
    "the lattice sites are represented by @xmath51 where @xmath52 s are integers .",
    "the gauge field @xmath53 is replaced by the link variables @xmath54 ) , where @xmath55 is the lattice constant / spacing .",
    "the link variable @xmath56 lives on the link between the sites @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a unit vector in the @xmath60th direction .",
    "the higgs field @xmath61 lives on the lattice site @xmath57 .",
    "the discretized lattice action is given by ,    @xmath62 + { 1 \\over 2 } \\left(\\phi^\\dag_n\\phi_n\\right )   + \\lambda\\left({1 \\over 2 } \\left(\\phi^\\dag_n\\phi_n\\right ) -1\\right)^2\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 is the product of links in an elementary square @xmath64 on the lattice .",
    "the @xmath39 field and other parameters are all dimensionless in the discretized action @xcite .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath65 at a spatial site @xmath52 is trace of the path ordered product of all temporal link variables on the temporal loop going through @xmath52 . a @xmath0 rotation can be carried out by multiplying all temporal links on a fixed temporal slice of the lattice by an element of the @xmath0 group .",
    "this operation leaves all terms of the above action invariant except the @xmath66 dependent term .",
    "this term is solely responsible for the explicit breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry .    in the simulations an initial configuration of @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "is selected .",
    "this initial configuration is then repeatedly updated to generate a monte carlo history . in an update a new configuration",
    "is generated from an old one according to the boltzmann probability factor @xmath69 and the principle of detailed balance .",
    "these conditions are implemented using pseudo heat - bath algorithm for the @xmath39 field @xcite and the standard heat - bath algorithm for the link variables @xmath70 s @xcite . apart from updating procedure over relaxation methods",
    "are also used to reduce the autocorrelations between adjacent configurations along the monte carlo trajectory @xcite .",
    "the simulations are carried out for different values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the coupling @xmath72 controls the nature of the higgs transition .",
    "the transition is first oder(crossover ) for small(large ) values of @xmath72 . for a fixed @xmath73 the parameter @xmath66 plays the role of the transition parameter for the higgs transition . for high @xmath74",
    "the system is found to be in the higgs phase with a non - zero higgs condensate . with decrease in @xmath66",
    "the condensate starts to melt and at the critical point @xmath75 the system undergoes transition to the higgs symmetric phase . for @xmath76 the higgs condensate vanishes . for our purpose it suffices to fix the coupling @xmath72 and study the @xmath0 symmetry at various values of @xmath66 . given a ( @xmath72,@xmath77 small(large ) @xmath21 corresponds to the confinement(deconfinement ) phase .",
    "the confinement - deconfinement transition takes place at the critical point @xmath78 @xcite . to study the @xmath0 symmetry at different @xmath66 we compute the polyakov loop distribution and simulate confinement - deconfinement transition",
    "we also compute various observables which are sensitive to the @xmath0 symmetry . in fig.1a",
    "we show the polyakov loop distribution(@xmath79 ) in the deconfined phase for @xmath13 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the explicit breaking of @xmath82 symmetry is clearly seen in the distribution @xmath79 .",
    "the local maximum here corresponds to the meta - stable state of the system . for @xmath83",
    "the polyakov loop is complex .",
    "for better illustration we show the distribution of phase of the polyakov loop @xmath84 instead of @xmath79 on the complex plain .",
    "in fig.1b we show @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath14 .",
    "the peak at @xmath87 clearly dominates the other two local maxima as a result of the @xmath88 explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "it has been observed that the asymmetry in the above distributions increases when @xmath66 is increased further . beyond some value of @xmath66 ( which depends on @xmath72 and @xmath89 ) the local maxima(the meta - stable states ) disappear .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is supposed to be there only when @xmath90 as the matter and gauge fields decouple .",
    "surprisingly it is found in our simulations that in the higgs symmetric phase ( @xmath91 ) the distributions of the polyakov loop exhibit the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this is evident in the distribution @xmath92 of the polyakov loop for @xmath13 shown in fig.2a .",
    "similarly the distribution @xmath84 for @xmath14 shows the @xmath88 symmetry . for small @xmath66 the higgs correlation length can become shorter than the lattice spacing",
    ", i.e @xmath67 and @xmath93 are not correlated . with the product @xmath94 having no preferential orientation with respect to @xmath56 the @xmath66 term in eq.(8 ) can not affect the @xmath0 symmetry . though this is plausible but",
    "our simulations suggest that this is not the reason for the @xmath0 realization / restoration .",
    "the @xmath66 term was found to be non - zero finite .",
    "the product @xmath95 tend to align with @xmath56 . when a @xmath0 rotation ( @xmath96 ) is carried out on any configuration from the thermal ensemble the resulting configuration",
    "is found to be out of equilibrium .",
    "this is because the new configuration has far higher action ( eq.(8 ) ) then any configuration in the thermal ensemble .",
    "interestingly this cost in the action can be compensated by varying the @xmath39 field , i.e @xmath97 , coupled with the gauge rotation of the links .",
    "@xmath48 can be obtained by monte carlo updates of @xmath39 , though it is not clear how @xmath39 and @xmath48 are related .",
    "we observed that the symmetry @xmath98 is there only in the higgs symmetric phase ( @xmath76 ) and when the number of lattice points in the temporal direction is @xmath99 .    to see the @xmath0 symmetry in the polyakov loop distribution",
    ", the tunneling between the different @xmath0 sectors has to be high .",
    "the tunneling rate decreases away from the transition point and also for larger lattice size . for these cases even for a reasonably large statistics",
    "it is unlikely that the population of the different polyakov loop sectors will be found same .",
    "for example , for @xmath100 and @xmath101 lattice we do not see any tunneling between the different @xmath82 sectors up to @xmath102 statistics .",
    "however the histogram of the polyakov loop in the two sectors are in perfect agreement when one distribution is @xmath82 rotated as is seen clearly in fig.3a .",
    "apart from the polyakov loop distributions we also compute the free energy of the different polyakov loop sectors . in fig.3b we show the average value of the gauge action vs @xmath21 for the two @xmath82 states(called @xmath103ve and @xmath104ve ) for @xmath13 .",
    "the gauge action for the @xmath103ve(@xmath104ve ) sector is calculated by taking the average over configurations for which the polyakov loop is @xmath103ve(@xmath104ve ) .",
    "the gauge actions for the two @xmath82 states are identical for all @xmath21 .",
    "the free energy of each of these states can now be computed by integrating the gauge action @xmath105 in @xmath21@xcite .",
    "since the gauge action are identical , the free energy will be same for the two polyakov loop sectors .",
    "the confinement - deconfinement transition for @xmath13 for small @xmath66 has been investigated previously @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that the average value of the polyakov loop does have critical behavior and found to be in the universality class of the ising model . in this study for the first time we carry out the finite size scaling analysis of the binder cumulant @xcite . in fig.4a",
    "the binder cumulant @xcite around transition point is shown for different spatial volumes .",
    "the value of the binder cumulant at the crossing point corresponds to the universality class of the @xmath106d ising model .",
    "further the scaling of the binder cumulant , shown in fig.4b , gives a value for the critical exponent @xmath107 which is also consistent with the same universality class .",
    "these results clearly show that the confinement - deconfinement transition is second order even for finite but small @xmath66 .",
    "conventionally it is thought that the confinement - deconfinement transition is true second order only for @xmath90 .",
    "we believe that the origin of this second order confinement - deconfinement transition at @xmath108 is because the fluctuations respect the @xmath82 symmetry .",
    "the realization of the @xmath82 symmetry and the critical behavior of the polyakov loop for finite @xmath66 suggests that there should be a line of second order confinement - deconfinement transitions starting from @xmath90 line on the phase diagram .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 symmetry in @xmath1higgs theories for @xmath109 using numerical monte carlo simulations .",
    "the presence of the higgs fields explicitly breaks the @xmath0 symmetry which is reflected in the asymmetry in the polyakov loop distribution . the strength of the explicit symmetry breaking varies with the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath66 . on the other hand , given a @xmath110 the strength does not vary much with the confinement - deconfinement transition parameter @xmath21 . the patterns of explicit symmetry breaking observed in @xmath13 and @xmath14 are very similar .",
    "this suggests that this pattern will continue to hold for higher @xmath89 .",
    "the explicit breaking of @xmath0 symmetry has clear pattern along any trajectory on @xmath111 plane of decreasing @xmath66 and the higgs condensate .",
    "it has been observed that for large values of these variables the explicit symmetry breaking is so large that @xmath79 and @xmath84 have only one peak in deconfined phases .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is maximally broken in this case .",
    "further down as @xmath66 and the higgs condensate decrease multiple peaks in the distributions do appear in the deconfined phase .",
    "for some other trajectories on the @xmath111 plane , in the higgs phase region , it is possible that only one of these two situations may arise .",
    "as the trajectory crosses the higgs transition point @xmath112 the explicit symmetry breaking drops sharply .",
    "close to the transition point in the higgs symmetric phase @xmath79 and @xmath84 peaks are almost degenerate .",
    "it will be important to see the effect of @xmath113 ( number of lattice points in temporal direction ) on this small but finite explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "it is possible that the explicit symmetry breaking vanishes in all of the higgs symmetric phase in the infinite volume limit .",
    "conventionally it is expected that the explicit symmetry breaking will vanish only when @xmath66 is zero . in our simulations",
    "( with @xmath114 ) it is found that the explicit symmetry breaking vanishes in the higgs symmetric phase away from the transition point .",
    "the value of @xmath66 for which the symmetry restored in the theory occurs depends on @xmath72 . for larger @xmath72",
    "the the restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry occurs at a higher value of @xmath66 .",
    "this suggests that for a given @xmath21 a line divides the @xmath111 plane into @xmath0 symmetric and @xmath0 broken regions . in the @xmath0 symmetric region",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken for @xmath115 which leads to @xmath89 degenerate states .",
    "all physical observables such as the gauge action , the kinetic term etc . are found to be same for all the @xmath0 states . as a consequence",
    "the free energies of the different @xmath0 states are the same .",
    "our results clearly indicate that the higgs condensate plays role of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking field .",
    "however more work is needed to relate the higgs condensate to the effective field for the @xmath0 symmetry . in this work",
    "we have used the higgs transition point to infer the values of the higgs condensate . since the higgs field is not gauge invariant",
    "the higgs condensate is not well defined .",
    "we plan to calculate the higgs condensate by appropriately choosing a gauge which will make the higgs condensate well defined and find out the connection between the higgs condensate and the explicit symmetry field for @xmath0 .",
    "the realization of @xmath0 symmetry at non - zero @xmath66 is in contradiction with effective potential calculations which show that the @xmath0 symmetry will be restored only when the higgs mass is infinite . in these calculations",
    "only the zero mode of the polyakov loop is coupled to the matter fields .",
    "we expect that taking care of the higher modes of the polyakov loop will reduce the discrepancy between the non - perturbative and analytic approaches .",
    "the restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry in the higgs symmetric phase has important implications for the phase diagrams of @xmath1higgs theories . for @xmath13",
    "previously the confinement - deconfinement transition was thought to be a crossover for non - zero @xmath66 .",
    "our results show that there will be a line of second order confinement - deconfinement transitions in the @xmath116 plane extending from the point @xmath117 . since the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken at high temperatures in the higgs symmetric phase with vanishing condensate it will lead to rich structures in this phase .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry will lead to time independent topological defects solutions such as domain walls , strings etc .",
    "these defects can form even when the @xmath0 symmetry is mildly broken but they are not time independent and are short lived .",
    "we mention here that the restoration of @xmath0 symmetry may be possible in the case of gauge fields coupled to fundamental fermions as well . in this case @xmath118 ( which couples to the @xmath8 field ) may play the role similar to the higgs field in restoring the @xmath0 symmetry .",
