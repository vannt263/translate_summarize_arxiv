    "+ hades consists of a 6-coil toroidal magnet centered on the beam axis and six identical detection sections located between the coils and covering polar angles from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . in the measurement presented here ,",
    "the six sectors comprised a gaseous ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , four planes of multi - wire drift chambers ( mdcs ) for track reconstruction and two time - of - flight walls ( tof and tofino ) , supplemented at forward polar angles with pre - shower chambers .",
    "for each sector , the tof and tofino / pre - shower detectors are combined to a multiplicity and electron trigger array ( meta ) . + a @xmath17ar beam of @xmath18 particles / s was incident on a four - fold segmented kcl target with a total thickness corresponding to @xmath19 interaction length .",
    "a fast diamond start detector located upstream of the target was used to determine the interaction time .",
    "the data readout was started by a first - level trigger ( lvl1 ) decision , requiring an observed charged - particle multiplicity @xmath20 in the tof / tofino detectors , accepting approximately 35% of the nuclear reaction cross section .",
    "this centrality selection translates into an average participants number @xmath21= 38.5@xmath22 , as described in @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of k@xmath23 decays requires a clean and unambiguous pion identification within the high multiplicity track ensemble of each event .",
    "charged particles fire wires in the mdcs in front and behind the magnetic field and one or more hits in the meta detector . in the so - called cluster finder software",
    "@xcite track - segments are formed using the information from the two pairs of mdc planes . in the track - segment fitting procedures",
    "possible trajectories through the two track segments and the meta hits are calculated . for a detailed description of the tracking procedure see @xcite .",
    "after proper correlation of track segments and meta hit points , particle momenta were calculated with a runge kutta integration of the trajectory in the magnetic field .",
    "the graphical cuts utilized to select the @xmath24 sample on the base of the @xmath25 versus momentum distributions are the same as shown in @xcite .",
    "this selection allows to extract a high purity pion sample .",
    "muons from pion decays ( @xmath26 m ) inside the hades spectrometer constitute only a small fraction of the tracks and are mostly misidentified as pions due to their small mass difference .",
    "hence , the effective losses are in the order of few percent only , as shown in @xcite .",
    "+ the efficiency of the mdc - @xmath25 cut and the purity of the selected sample have been extracted from experimental data , selecting particles fully reconstructed in the spectrometer and identified by the meta as a reference and then verified using simulations , applying to the simulated tracks the same selection criteria as for the real data .",

    "while these values are rather independent of particle momentum for @xmath28 mesons , a significant reduction of the purity is observed for @xmath29 with momenta p@xmath30mev / c due to contamination by misidentified protons .",
    "however , the @xmath11 reconstruction is only very weakly affected by the purity of the high momentum @xmath31 sample .",
    "the acceptance of the hades spectrometer and the efficiency of the @xmath24 reconstruction were determined by a full - scale geant3 @xcite simulation . a sample of pions generated with a flat distribution in rapidity ( @xmath32 ) and transverse mass ( 0 @xmath33 mev / c@xmath34 ) was propagated through the whole spectrometer yielding the geometrical acceptance from registered detector hits .",

    "is chosen to ease the comparison with a boltzmann distribution .",
    "a fit according to @xmath37 has been applied to the @xmath38 distribution in two adjacent @xmath39 intervals .",
    "the pions mainly stem from the decay of the @xmath40 resonance and are produced at different stages of the collision with varying hardness as time proceeds .",

    "+ it is very interesting to notice that the iqmd simulation assuming a repulsive potential agrees rather well with the experimental data for all the rapidity bins .",
    "the calculations without the potential , on the other hand , overestimate the experimental data , especially in the low transverse momentum regime ( @xmath123 400 mev / c ) , as is clearly visible in the ratio plots .",
    "this behavior is slightly more evident at mid - rapidity but persists with the same trend for the whole rapidity range .",
    "+ we note that the @xmath12 spectra exhibit the most sensitive dependence on the k@xmath2-nucleus potential .",
    "the rapidity distribution is sensitive to variations of the quantity @xmath100 as well , but this effect is less pronounced and the conclusions drawn on the potential strength are strongly dependent upon the normalization of the simulated to experimental data .",
    "hence the accurate study of the @xmath12 spectra delivers a new more powerful tool to extract quantitative information .",
    "rapidity and transverse momentum spectra of @xmath10 and k@xmath1 mesons produced in ar+kcl collisions at 1.756 a gev and measured with hades have been investigated . for the first time in this energy regime ,",
    "k@xmath1 spectra have been measured with high statistics and precision in almost the full phase space and , in particular , down to low momenta ( @xmath124 50 mev / c ) .",
    "+ the @xmath10 data have been shown and compared quantitatively to iqmd calculations , using an absolute normalization based on the selection of the impact parameter @xmath45 fm in the simulations and a centrality selection on the experimental data corresponding to the most central 35% of the total cross section .",
    "the @xmath28 rapidity density distribution shows a quantitative agreement with the iqmd model within 15% .",
    "+ for k@xmath1 mesons the transverse mass and the rapidity density distribution are compared to previously published k@xmath5 data and agree well with them , both in shape and yield .",
    "the comparison of the k@xmath1 rapidity distribution with iqmd calculations does not seem to be solid enough to extract reliable information about the potential , since the normalization is not certain and the calculations corresponding to different values of the potential deliver curves with the same shape .",
    "the k@xmath1 p@xmath51 distributions have been found to be a better observable and have been compared to calculations by the iqmd model assuming different strengths of the k@xmath2-nuclear medium potential .",
    "this comparison supports the existence of a rather strong repulsive potential of about 40 mev .",
    "these data are now available for further studies via the available transport models .",
