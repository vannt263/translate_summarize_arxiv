    "the eulerian - lagrangian formulation of the ( inviscid ) euler dynamics in terms of advected weber - clebsch potentials @xcite was extended by constantin @xcite to cover the ( viscous ) navier - stokes dynamics .",
    "ohkitani and constantin ( oc ) @xcite then performed numerical studies of this formulation of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "they concluded that the diffusive lagrangian map becomes noninvertible under time evolution and requires resetting for its calculation .",
    "they proposed the observed sharp increase of the frequency of resettings as a new diagnostic of vortex reconnection .",
    "we were able to recently complement these results , using an approach that is based on a generalized set of equations of motion for the weber - clebsch potentials that turned out to depend on a parameter @xmath2 which has the unit of time for the navier - stokes case @xcite ( the mhd case is different , see below section [ sec : mpsec ] ) .",
    "the oc formulation is the ( singular ) @xmath3 limit case of our generalized formulation . using direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the viscous taylor - green vortex @xcite we found that for @xmath4 the navier - stokes dynamics was well reproduced at small enough reynolds numbers _ without _ resetting .",
    "however , performing resettings allowed computation at much higher reynolds number .",
    "the aim of the present article is to extend these results to different flows , both in the navier - stokes case and in magnetohydrodynamics , and thereby obtain a new diagnostic for _ magnetic _ reconnection .",
    "our main conclusion is that intense reconnection of magnetic field lines is indeed captured in our new generalized formulation as a sharp increase of the frequency of resettings .",
    "here follows a summary of our principal results .",
    "we first derive new generalized equations of motion for the weber - clebsch potentials that describe both the navier - stokes and mhd dynamics . performing dns of the boratav , pelz and zabusky flow @xcite , that was previously used by ohkitani and constantin @xcite",
    ", we first check that our generalized formalism captures the intense navier - stokes vortex reconnection of this flow .",
    "we demonstrate the reconnection of vortices is actually occurring at the instant of intense activity in the enstrophy , near the lows of the determinant that trigger the resettings .",
    "we then study the correlation of magnetic reconnection with increase of resetting frequency by performing dns of several prototypical mhd flows : the @xmath0d arnold , beltrami and childress ( abc ) flow @xcite and the orszag - tang vortex in @xmath1d @xcite and @xmath0d @xcite .",
    "let us consider a @xmath0d vector field @xmath5 depending on time and ( @xmath0-dimensional ) space , with coordinates @xmath6 .",
    "assume @xmath5 satisfies an evolution equation of the kind : @xmath7 where greek indices @xmath8 denote vector field components running from @xmath9 to @xmath0 , @xmath10 is a given @xmath0d velocity field and we have used the convective derivative defined by @xmath11    in the following sections , two different cases will be considered . in section [ sec : ns case ] ( navier - stokes case ) the vector field @xmath5 will correspond to the velocity field @xmath10 , whereas in section [ sec : mhd case ] ( mhd case ) it will correspond to the magnetic vector potential @xmath12 .    let us first recall that performing a change from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates on the weber transformation @xcite leads to a description of the euler equations as a system of three coupled active vector equations in a form that generalizes the clebsch variable representation @xcite .    our starting point will be to apply this classical weber - clebsch representation to the field @xmath5 :    @xmath13    where each element of the @xmath0 pairs of weber - clebsch potentials @xmath14 is a scalar function .    performing a variation on the weber - clebsch representation ( [ eq : wc_z ] ) yields the relation @xmath15 where the symbol @xmath16 stands for any ( spatial or temporal ) partial derivative .",
    "taking into account the identity , it is straightforward to derive from ( [ eq : delta(clebsch transformation ) ] ) the following explicit expression for the convective derivative of the vector field @xmath5 :    @xmath17      following steps that are similar to those presented in our previous paper @xcite , we now derive a system of equations of motion for the weber - clebsch potentials ( [ eq : wc_z ] ) that is equivalent to the original equation ( [ eq : z ] ) . if we use the rhs of equation ( [ eq : z ] ) to replace the lhs of our general identity ( [ eq : dt(clebsch transformation ) ] ) , the resulting relation can be solved for the time derivative of the potentials : @xmath18\\\\ \\label{eq : evolution_tilde clebsch_mu } \\frac{d\\mu^i}{d t } & = & \\kappa \\triangle \\mu^i + \\widetilde{m}^i[\\lambda,\\mu]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 obey the linear equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 $ ] is an arbitrary scalar related to the non - unique separation of a gradient part in eq.([eq : dt(clebsch transformation ) ] ) : @xmath23    the `` divergence - less gauge '' ( [ eq : divergence ] ) allows one to express @xmath24 in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as the solution of the linear equation @xmath27 thus there is no need to solve equation ( [ eq : evolution_phi ] ) for the field @xmath24 , since this equation is identically satisfied when @xmath24 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lap_phi ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : linear system tilde l m ] ) above is a system of @xmath0 linear equations for the @xmath28 unknowns @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath29 there is a simple solution to ( [ eq : linear system tilde l m ] ) : @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the evolution equations ( [ eq : evolution_tilde clebsch_lambda ] ) and ( [ eq : evolution_tilde clebsch_mu ] ) represent simple advection .",
    "the linear system ( [ eq : linear system tilde l m ] ) is underdetermined ( @xmath0 equations for @xmath28 unknowns ) . in order to find a solution to the system we need to impose extra conditions .",
    "since @xmath19 appear in the equations on an equal footing , it is natural to supplement the system by a requirement of minimum norm , namely that @xmath31 be the smallest possible ( this is the so - called general moore - penrose approach @xcite , see also our previous paper @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq : b ] ) can be written as @xmath61 which is indeed of the general form ( [ eq : z ] ) with @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "spatially periodic fields can be generated from the weber - clebsch representation ( [ eq : wc_z ] ) by setting @xmath65 and assuming that @xmath66 and the other fields @xmath25 and @xmath24 appearing in ( [ eq : wc_z ] ) are periodic .",
    "indeed , any given periodic field @xmath5 can be represented in this way by setting @xmath67 note that the time independent non - periodic part of @xmath26 of the form given in ( [ eq : mu def ] ) is such that the _ gradients _ of @xmath26 are periodic . it is easy to check that this representation is consistent with the generalized equations of motions ( [ eq : new_alg l],[eq : new_alg m ] ) .",

    ". equations ( [ eq : resetting mu ] ) , ( [ eq : resetting lambda ] ) and ( [ eq : resetting phi ] ) are used not only to initialize the weber - clebsch potentials at the start of the calculation but also to _ reset _ them to the current value of the field @xmath68 , obtained from ( [ eq : wc_z ] ) and ( [ eq : lap_phi ] ) , whenever the minimum of the determinant of the matrix ( [ eq : mat ] ) falls below a given threshold @xmath69    it is possible to capture reconnection events using resettings .",
    "the rationale for this approach is that reconnection events are associated to localized , intense and increasingly fast activity which will drive the potentials to a ( unphysical ) singularity in a finite time .",
    "one way to detect this singularity is via the alignment of the gradients of the potentials , which leads to the vanishing of @xmath70 at the point(s ) where this intense activity or ` anomalous diffusion ' is taking place .",
    "now , the time scale of this singularity is much smaller than the time scale of the reconnection process itself",
    "@xcite , so when @xmath70 goes below the given threshold and a resetting of the potentials is performed , the anomalous diffusion starts taking place again , more intensely as we approach the fastest reconnection period , driving the new ( reset ) potentials to a new finite - time singularity , in a time scale that decreases as we approach this period",
    ". therefore , successive resettings will be more and more frequent near the period of fastest reconnection , and that is what we observe in the numerical simulations .",
    "this procedure will be used to capture reconnection events in particular flows in both the navier - stokes case ( @xmath71 , section [ sec : ns ] ) and the mhd case ( @xmath72 , sections [ sec:2dot ] and [ sec:3dot ] ) .",
    "ohkitani and constantin ( oc ) @xcite used a flow that initially consists of two orthogonally placed vortex tubes that was previously introduced in boratav , pelz and zabusky ( bpz ) @xcite to study in detail vortex reconnection .",
    "our previous numerical study of the generalized weber - clebsch description of navier - stokes dynamics @xcite was performed using the taylor - green vortex , a flow in which vorticity layers are formed in the early stage , followed by their rolling - up by kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite .",
    "it can be argued @xcite that cut - and - connect type reconnections are much more pronounced in the bpz flow than in the taylor - green flow . in this section",
    "we present comparisons , performed on the bpz flow , of our @xmath73 generalized algorithm with direct navier - stokes simulations and with oc original approach .",
    "the potentials are integrated with resettings in resolution @xmath74 for a reynolds number of @xmath75 , which is the one used by bpz and oc .    the bpz initial data is explicitly given in @xcite .      in order to characterize the precision of the @xmath73 weber - clebsch algorithm",
    ", we now compare the velocity field @xmath76 obtained from ( [ eq : wc_z ] ) and ( [ eq : lap_phi ] ) , by evolving the weber - clebsch potentials using ( [ eq : new_alg l])([eq : explicit g ] ) , with the velocity field obtained independently by direct navier - stokes evolution from the bpz initial data .",
    "more precisely , we compare the associated kinetic enstrophy @xmath77 where the kinetic energy spectrum @xmath78 is defined by averaging the fourier transform @xmath79 of the velocity field ( [ eq : wc_z ] ) on spherical shells of width @xmath80 , @xmath81    , width=302 ]    , width=302 ]    figure [ enstrophybpz ] shows that the kinetic enstrophy is well resolved , independently of the choice of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we study the influence of the parameter @xmath2 on the temporal distribution of the intervals @xmath82 between resetting times @xmath83 , at fixed value of the resetting threshold @xmath84 . using the same reynolds number and resolution that was used to create fig .",

    "we also show the corresponding @xmath85 for a replica of the simulation performed by oc , that is in excellent agreement with our general case .",
    "we see that , independently of @xmath2 , there are sharp minima in @xmath85 during the periods of maximum enstrophy ( see fig .",
    "[ enstrophybpz ] ) . inspection of figure [ figurarecon ] demonstrates that the deepest minimum corresponds in fact to the time when reconnection is taking place .",
    "the main tubes in the left and right figures are isosurfaces of vorticity corresponding to @xmath86 of the maximum vorticity , which is attained inside each of the main tubes .",
    "figure [ figuradet ] ( left ) shows that the spatial region where the determinant @xmath70 goes below the threshold before each resetting corresponds to a small , localized neighborhood between the main interacting vortices .",
    "this region is seen in the right figure as a bridge connecting the two vortices : this bridge is an isosurface of vorticity corresponding to @xmath87 of the maximum vorticity , which is attained inside the bridge .",
    "the main tubes correspond to isosurfaces of @xmath88 of the maximum vorticity .",
    "note that this behavior of the determinant @xmath89 is also true for any value of @xmath2 ( data not shown ) , confirming in this way the original rationale for the study of reconnection with the aid of resettings .",

    "the magnetic potential @xmath72 is obtained in terms of the weber - clebsch potentials from ( [ eq : wc_z ] ) and ( [ eq : lap_phi ] ) , and the weber - clebsch potentials are evolved using equations ( [ eq : new_alg l])([eq : explicit g ] ) .",
    "we treat the evolution of the velocity field in two different ways : ( i ) as a kinematic dynamo ( abc flow , section [ sec : abc ] ) , where the velocity is kept constant in time ; ( ii ) using the full mhd equations ( orszag - tang @xmath1d and @xmath0d , sections [ sec:2dot ] and [ sec:3dot ] ) , where the velocity field is evolved using the momentum equation ( [ eq : momentum ] ) .",

    "resettings will be performed with a resetting threshold @xmath84 .",
    "we have checked that @xmath95 and @xmath96 give results that vary only slightly ( figures not shown ) .",

    "we have shown that the generalized weber - clebsch evolution equations allow to study reconnection events for both navier - stokes and mhd dynamics .",
    "we have checked for the navier - stokes bpz flow that reconnection events can be viewed as periods of fast and localized changes in the geometry of the weber - clebsch potentials , leading to more and more frequent resetting of the potentials .",
    "we have applied the new generalized weber - clebsch evolution equations to the study of magnetic reconnection in mhd .",
    "taking as examples both the @xmath1d and @xmath0d orszag - tang vortices , we show a correlation of the reconnection events ( associated to periods of high magnetic dissipation ) with the periods of fast changes in the geometry of the weber - clebsch potentials , leading to frequent resettings of the potentials .    however ,",
    "unlike the case of bpz reconnection , in this case the frequency of resettings does not have a sharp peak but a smeared one .",
    "notice that , in the navier - stokes case , the corresponding frequency of resettings for the taylor - green vortex has also a mild peak .",
    "@xcite one can argue that the 2d and 3d orszag - tang flows are more similar to taylor - green than to bpz .",
    "indeed , both orszag - tang and taylor - green have initial conditions with just a few fourier modes , therefore they are extended spatially , whereas the bpz initial condition is spatially localized ( two orthogonal vortex tubes ) .",
    "this wide spatial extent of the vorticity in both orszag - tang and taylor - green vortices , as opposed to the localized extent of bpz , might be the reason for the mildness in the shape of the minimum of the time between resettings . in both spatially extended cases",
    "one expects reconnection events to happen in relatively distant places at similar times , as opposed to the bpz very localized cut - and - connect type of reconnection . in terms of the singularities of the weber - clebsch potentials and",
    "associated resetting , we should observe ( to be studied in detail in future work ) that the set of points where @xmath70 goes below the threshold consists of an extended region , as opposed to bpz where we have confirmed that these points belong to a very localized region in space .",
    "consequently , the widely distributed events that lead to resetting in orszag - tang and taylor - green configurations would tend to be less correlated in time , leading to the smearing of the minimum of the curve for the time between resettings , which would otherwise be very sharp if the events were more localized and therefore more correlated in time .",
