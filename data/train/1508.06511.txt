    "the smallest value of @xmath16 for which @xmath17 holds is called the determinantal complexity of @xmath5 and denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the permanent polynomial : @xmath19    valiant postulated that the determinantal complexity of @xmath8 is not polynomially bounded - i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "this is one of the most important conjectures in complexity theory .",
    "so far the best known lower bound on @xmath21 is @xmath22 , known from @xcite , @xcite .",

    "valiant s postulate implies that if @xmath8 is projection of the determinant polynomial @xmath29 then @xmath16 is @xmath30 .",
    "we refer to the expository article by von - zur gathen on valiant s result @xcite .",
    "we define the notion of read-@xmath0 projection of determinant , which is a natural restriction of the notion of projection of determinant .",
    "let @xmath31 be a set of variables and let @xmath28 be a field .",
    "we say that a matrix @xmath32 is a _",

    "note that only a multilinear polynomial can be expressible as a read - once determinant .",
    "the following upper bound on determinantal complexity , proved in section 2 , is one of the motivations for studying this model .",

    "ryser s formula for the permanent expresses the permanent polynomial @xmath8 as a read-@xmath43 projection of determinant .",
    "in contrast , it follows from theorem [ dc - rod ] that valiant s hypothesis implies the following : @xmath44 for a read-@xmath45 matrix @xmath3 of _ any size_. so the expressibility question is more relevant in the context of read-@xmath0 determinant model rather than the size lower bound question . in this paper",

    "we prove theorem [ perm - not - rod ] in section 3 as a consequence of non - expressibility of elementary symmetric polynomials as read - once determinants .",
    "our interest in this model also stems from the following reason .",
    "most of the existing lower - bound techniques for various models , including monotone circuits , depth-3 circuits , non - commutative abps etc , are not sensitive to the coefficients of the monomials of the polynomial for which the lower - bound is proved .",
    "for example , the monotone circuit lower - bound for permanent polynomial by jerrum and snir @xcite , carries over to any polynomial with same monomial set as permanent .",
    "the same applies to nisan s rank argument @xcite or the various lower bound results based on the partial derivative techniques ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    on the other hand , for proving lower bounds on the determinantal complexity of the permanent , one must use some properties of the permanent polynomial which are not shared by the determinant polynomial .",
    "a natural question is whether there are models more restrictive than determinantal complexity ( so that proving lower bounds may be easier ) and which are coefficient - sensitive .",
    "read-@xmath0 determinants appear to be a good choice for such a model . in light of the above discussion and to formally distinguish the complexity of a polynomial and that of its monomial set , we have the following definition .    for @xmath49 $ ] , we denote by _",
