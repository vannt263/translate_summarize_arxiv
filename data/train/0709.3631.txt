    "the above hamiltonian , besides belonging to an integrable model , is distinguished by its @xmath11-invariance .",
    "namely , one has the following representation @xmath12 in terms of the matrices @xmath13which obey the familiar @xmath11-commutation relations@xmath14=[2s^{z}]_{q}\\ .",

    "it is therefore not clear whether ( [ h ] ) constitutes a well - defined quantum integrable system or is even diagonalizable .",
    "nevertheless , numerical computations show that the hamiltonian possesses real spectrum for @xmath21 .",
    "this raises the questions whether the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is related to a hermitian hamiltonian via introducing a different inner product or performing a similarity transformation .    in our previous work we established for the two cases    1 .",
    "@xmath22 and 2 .",
    "@xmath23(here @xmath24 is the number of sites )    that the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is quasi - hermitian ( see e.g. sgh92,most04 ) .",
    "that is , we proved by explicit construction that there exists a _ positive , hermitian and invertible _",
    "operator @xmath25 such that@xmath26this enabled us to introduce a new inner product @xmath27with respect to which the hamilton operator becomes hermitian,@xmath28hence , we rigorously established that ( [ h ] ) does indeed give rise to a well - defined quantum system .",
    "there is , however , an important difference between the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) : for @xmath22 one has first to carry out a reduction of the state space @xmath29 employing what is known as `` quantum group reduction '' @xcite in the literature in order to remove non - trivial jordan blocks of the hamiltonian . for @xmath30 such a reduction proved to be unnecessary .    in both cases , ( i ) and ( ii ) , we found in @xcite explicit algebraic expressions for @xmath31 utilising concepts related to @xmath32-symmetry ( see e.g. @xcite for recent reviews ) and the quantum analogue of schur - weyl duality @xcite .",
    "in fact , we established not only quasi - hermiticity of the hamiltonian but of an associated representation of the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath33 which is _ _",
    "_ _ obtained from @xmath34generators @xmath35  satisfying the commutation relations@xmath36again there is a representation @xmath37 in terms of pauli matrices by mapping @xmath38 , where the @xmath39 s are defined in terms of the local hamiltonians@xmath40 in @xcite we constructed a quasi - hermiticity operator @xmath31 such that @xmath41thus , we obtained a self - adjoint representation of the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath33 with respect to the inner product ( [ etaprod ] ) .",
    "we briefly review these results in section 2 of this paper .",
    "this is one of the few examples of a non - hermitian hamiltonian where quasi - hermiticity has been proved by an _",
    "explicit _ and _ exact _ construction of the operator @xmath31 .",
    "the new result in the present article is an entirely independent approach ( which does neither use @xmath32-symmetry nor quasi - hermiticity ) to arrive at the same self - adjoint representation of the temperley - lieb algebra for the case ( ii ) , i.e. when @xmath30 .",
    "namely , we will define for each fixed spin sector @xmath42 ( here @xmath43 is the number of down spins ) a positive functional @xmath44over the temperley - lieb algebra using only its graphical representation in terms of kauffman diagrams @xcite .",
    "we then employ a well - kown tool from the representation theory of @xmath45-algebras , the gelfand - naimark - segal ( gns ) construction , which provides us with an inner product @xmath46 in terms of the functional @xmath47 and an associated hilbert space @xmath48 .",
    "the gns construction is such that the temperley - lieb algebra generators @xmath49 act as self - adjoint operators over @xmath48 , thus giving rise to a hermitian hamiltonian @xmath50 .",
    "the main conjecture of this article is that the two self - adjoint representations , one induced by @xmath31 and the other by the functionals @xmath51 are unitarily equivalent .",
    "that is , there exists for each @xmath52 an isomorphism @xmath53 satisfying@xmath54and the identity@xmath55the left - hand side of the last equality can be computed by purely graphical means .",
    "this provides us with a novel , efficient formalism to investigate the spectrum , eigenvectors and , in the long term , correlation functions of the quantum group invariant xxz hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , this is also a new representation theoretic result for the temperley - lieb algebra which ( to the best of the author s knowledge ) appears not to be contained in the extensive literature on this subject , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the extension of this graphical calculus to the root of unity case , where a reduction of the state space needs to be carried out first , is still an open problem .",
    "in order that the reader can fully appreciate the main conjecture of this article we briefly review the results obtained for the quasi - hermiticty operator @xmath31 in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "we recall the following definitions from @xcite.@xmath56    .",
    "[ parity , time and spin - reversal ] .",
    "@xmath57 _ then we define the linear operator _ @xmath58 _ _",
    "on _ _ @xmath8 _ _ by setting__@xmath59_in contrast , the operator _ @xmath60 _ _  acts on the basis vectors as the identity , _ _ @xmath61__but is defined to be antilinear , such that _ _ @xmath62__thus , any matrix _ _ @xmath63 _ _  ( such as the hamiltonian _ _ @xmath64 _ _ ) is transformed into its complex conjugate under the adjoint action of _ _",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath65 _ finally , we introduce the ( linear ) spin - reversal operator _ @xmath66 _ _  by setting__@xmath67one now easily computes the transformation properties of the quantum group and temperley - lieb generators under the adjoint action of the involutions @xmath68 .",
    "they are summarised in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     again an illustrative example of how to obtain the above values might be helpful .",
    "let us consider the matrix element @xmath69 .",
    "the kauffman diagram is obtained by flipping the one for @xmath70 at the horizontal axis and then connecting it with the one for @xmath71 from above,@xmath72{scalarproduct610.eps}\\ .\\]]obviously , we have @xmath73 . adding the orientation @xmath74 on the top and bottom of the diagram we see that there are no unoriented lines or arcs , @xmath75 , and that we have two anti - clockwise oriented cups , @xmath76 .",
    "hence , @xmath77    the reader might wonder why we picked out this particular basis among other choices .",
    "the above basis vectors transform particularly simple under the action of the temperley - lieb algebra : the only coefficients which occur in the expansion are 0 , @xmath78 and powers of @xmath79 .",
    "it is in this basis that @xmath31 takes its simplest form and which is most suitable for the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "in this article we have presented a conjecture for a new construction of a self - adjoint representation of the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath33 with deformation parameter @xmath80 .",
    "clearly , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath81 this section of the unit circle shrinks to the point @xmath82 where the hamiltonian is hermitian and its algebraic structure drastically simplifies .    nevertheless , this construction is significant as it provides a practical advantage in computing the quasi - hermiticity operator @xmath31 for finite lattice size and , as for now , is the simplest starting point for the computation of the square root @xmath83 .",
    "the latter is needed to obtain the hamiltonian@xmath84which is hermitian with respect to the original scalar product on the state space .",
    "this hamiltonian might look very different form the initial hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) and there is a priori no reason to expect that it will have only nearest neighbour bulk interaction as the similarity transformation is highly nonlocal .",
    "preliminary computations for the case when @xmath85 , not discussed in @xcite , show that ( [ littleh ] ) indeed contains nonlocal bulk interactions .",
    "namely consider the non - hermitian hamiltonian@xmath86 , \\quad 0<g<1 ,   \\label{hg}\\]]then one can show for small @xmath87 its spectral equivalence with the hermitian hamiltonian@xmath88 ,   \\label{hg}\\]]where @xmath89 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators at lattice site @xmath90 . the hopping probability between a site @xmath90 and its @xmath7 neighbour is encoded in the real coefficients @xmath91 .",
    "up to order @xmath92 one finds that the nonvanishing contributions are@xmath93a more detailed discussion of this model , which warrants an investigation in its own right , will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the close investigation of the regime ( ii ) , @xmath94 might shed light on how to perform similar gns constructions for other sections of the unit circle .",
    "such a purely algebraic formulation is desirable in order to apply the results to a wider range of temperley - lieb type models , see e.g.kulish and references therein . for instance , by showing the more restrictive identity @xmath95 for the temperley - lieb algebra generators the results immediately generalize also to transfer matrices .",
    "namely , it easily follows from the results presented in @xcite and this article that we have constructed a unitary representation of the hecke algebra@xmath96the latter form the basic building blocks for transfer matrices , as for instance the ( non - symmetric ) double row transfer matrices considered in connection with lattice systems associated to logarithmic minimal models in @xcite . with regard to these applications",
    "it is natural to ask if the change of the inner product will effect the description in terms of logarithmic conformal field theory when @xmath81 and how this connects to possibly non - local interactions in the bulk .",
    "it is planned to address these questions in future work .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that we discussed in this article the problem of a non - hermitian quantum hamiltonian in the language of @xmath97-algebras .",
    "instead of using the concepts of quasi - hermiticity or @xmath32-symmetry we have considered an associated @xmath45-algebra of the given quantum mechanical system and investigated the existence of positive linear functionals .",
    "the latter have then be used to construct via the gns approach an inner product with respect to which the hamiltonian in question is hermitian .",
    "the formulation of quantum mechanics in the language of @xmath98-algebras is not new , but the novel aspect in this article is the presentation of an explicit example where this formulation can be connected with quasi - hermiticity and @xmath32-symmetry .",
