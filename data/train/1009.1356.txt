    "in the last decade many young ( @xmath2100myr ) stars have been identified in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "most of them belong to different moving groups , in which stars share common age and motion through the galaxy ( for review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . up to now nine",
    "such kinematic assemblages have been revealed within 150pc of our solar system with ages ranging from 8myr to 70myr @xcite , most situated in the southern hemisphere far from known star forming regions .",
    "however , tracing back their space trajectories shows that the birthplace of some of them may have been close to the nearest sites of massive star formation , the sco - cen region @xcite .",
    "young moving groups are rich in debris discs , which implies very active planetesimal formation around these stars @xcite .",
    "since the epochs of several key events in the early solar system ( e.g. formation of terrestrial planets , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) overlap well with the age of these groups , discs around the members are favourable and so present nearby and well - dated sites for investigations of planet formation and evolution .",
    "the members are also ideal targets when one would like to detect sub - stellar objects via direct imaging , since giant gas planets are thought to fade significantly during their evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "most of the known young stellar kinematic groups occupy a large area on the sky ( up to thousands of square degrees ) , which makes the identification of members very difficult .",
    "however , by combining astrometric data with radial velocity information and by applying relevant age diagnostic methods , one can search for additional members of known groups or reveal new kinematic assemblages . using this approach ,",
    "recent studies revealed more than 300 young stars belonging to nine kinematic groups in the vicinity of our sun @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that the census of these groups is far from complete , because of the lack of necessary kinematic information  particularly the radial velocities and the trigonometric distances  for most of the stars .",
    "for example , comparing the list of members of the @xmath0pic moving group with expectations based on the typical stellar mass function , @xcite estimated that about 60 m - type members remain undiscovered in our neighbourhood .",
    "the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) is a large scale spectroscopic survey with the aim of measuring radial velocities and atmospheric parameters for up to a several hundred thousand stars in the southern sky , using the uk schmidt telescope of the anglo - australian observatory equipped with the 6df multi - object spectrograph .",
    "the project has already resulted in two data releases @xcite and observed well over 300,000 stars away from the plane of the milky way ( @xmath3 ) and with apparent magnitudes @xmath4 .",
    "detailed comparisons with external sets revealed that the velocities are accurate to 1 - 2 km  s@xmath5 , while the errors of the stellar parameters are in the order of 400 k in temperature , 0.5 dex in gravity , and 0.2 dex in metallicity , all errors changing significantly across the temperature range of the stars @xcite .",
    "proper motion data in the catalogue have been taken from tycho-2 for the brighter stars , then ucac2 , usno - b and ppmx for the non - tycho stars .",
    "in order to capitalise on the potential of the rave survey in the census of young moving groups we used the 2008 august 30 internal release of the rave catalogue ( with almost 250,000 entries ) to search for new members of three young assemblages , the @xmath1cha association , the @xmath0pic moving group and the tucana - horologium association . each of the selected kinematic groups is younger than 40myr . from the location in the h - r diagram and from the lithium equivalent widths of the members @xcite derived an age of 12@xmath6myr for the @xmath0pic moving group ( bpmg ) .",
    "estimates based on dynamical back - tracing models of bpmg members , in good accordance with the previous value , yielded an age of @xmath712myr @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite derived a somewhat higher age , 21@xmath89myr , from lithium depletion in the group .",
    "for the slightly older tucana - horologium association ( tha ) the age estimates ranges between 10myr and 40myr @xcite , at present the mostly approved value is 30myr @xcite . the @xmath1cha association may be the youngest among the three selected assemblages .",
    "its age estimates range between 3myr and 15myr @xcite , most cases below 7myr .",
    "we used strict criteria to select potential candidates and then the rave - based list was supplemented by some additional stars taken primarily from the hipparcos catalogue ( sect .",

    "the rave sample was examined in the u , v , w , x , y , z space , defined by the heliocentric space motion ( u , v , w ) and the physical space coordinates centred on the sun ( x , y , z ) .",
    "the computation of these parameters for a star requires knowledge of its coordinates , proper motion , radial velocity and distance .",
    "while coordinates ( right ascension , declination ) , proper motion ( in right ascension and in declination ) and radial velocity information could be taken from the rave catalogue , for most of the rave stars no trigonometric distances were available .",
    "therefore , the u , v , w , x , y , z values were calculated for a range of distances , between 5pc and 120pc with a resolution of 1pc , to check whether any distance resulted in a coordinate which coincided with the region of a specific association in this 6-dimension space . in those cases where a rave star has a trigonometric parallax , measured by hipparcos @xcite",
    ", we used that value in the computations .",
    "the search was limited for those stars whose proper motion measurement fullfils the following criteria 1 ) @xmath9mas yr@xmath5 ; 2 ) @xmath105 .    the characteristic space motion ( u@xmath11 , v@xmath11 , w@xmath11 ) of the groups were taken from @xcite .",
    "we selected those objects from the rave catalogue , where @xmath12 < 4$]km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the chosen limit corresponds to the internal dispersion of the known members of the groups , while the distance resulting the minimum value was adopted as the kinematic distance to the object . for the @xmath0 pic moving group ( hereafter bpmg ) , @xcite found a correlation between the u component of the galactic space motion and the x space coordinate that was taken into account by calculating the u@xmath11 value as a function of x , using their eq.4 .",
    "we searched for bpmg candidate members within 80pc of the sun . for @xmath1cha ( eca ) and tuc - hor ( tha )",
    "candidates the search was limited to a region defined by the known members of the groups @xcite . using this method we compiled an initial list of stars , that includes 3 eca , 803 bpmg and 62 tha candidate members .",
    "the initial lists were further evaluated and filtered : 1 ) placing our candidates in the colour - magnitude diagrams of the specific kinematic groups ; and 2 ) by searching for x - ray counterparts in the _ rosat _ catalogues @xcite .",
    "we selected only those targets whose fractional x - ray luminosities ( l@xmath13/l@xmath14 ) and position in the colour - magnitude diagram were consistent with the similar properties of the known members ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a  d ) .",
    "our procedure finally resulted in 2 , 9 and 7 candidate members of the @xmath1cha , bpmg and tha groups , respectively . by searching the literature we revealed that ten of our candidates ( 1 @xmath1cha , 4 bpmg and 5 tha stars ) are already known members .",
    "moreover , one of our tha candidate , j042110.3 - 243221 ( hd27679 ) , has already assigned to the columba moving group by @xcite , while one of the bpmg candidate ( tyc 7558 - 655 - 1 ) has an ambiguous assignment in the literature .",
    "@xcite identified tyc 7558 - 655 - 1 as a possible member of the columba group , on the other hand @xcite proposed that this star likely belongs to the bpmg .",
    "we omitted these known / ambiguous members from the further observations and analyis .",
    "thus , we finally selected six rave candidates ( 1 @xmath1cha , 4 bpmg and 1 tha stars ) for further investigations .",
    "these rave - based candidate list was supplemented by one additional star , j19560294 - 3207186 , that is the comoving pair of one of new candidate object ( tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 ) .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue was also searched for additional candidates members .",
    "similarly to the rave sample , the hipparcos stars were also examined in the u , v , w , x , y , z space . here",
    "the radial velocity data are lacking for a significant fraction of stars , therefore the u , v , w values were calculated for a range of radial velocities ( radial velocity values were varied between @xmath1550 km  s@xmath5 and + 50 km  s@xmath5 with a resolution of 0.5 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "for those stars where radial velocity data were available in the literature @xcite we used the measured value in the computation .",
    "the search was limited to stars with spectral type later than f8 . in the selection of candidate stars we applied almost identical criteria as in the case of rave objects .",
    "the only change in the method was related to those stars where all six parameters are available , thus u , v , w , x , y , z could be computed without any assumption , where we utilized a weaker criterion concerning to the x - ray luminosity of the object : we retained those candidates too where the upper limit of the x - ray luminosity was consistent with the similar property of the known members .",
    "using this method in the bpmg we could recover  with the exception of hip10679  all known members that are quoted in hipparcos ( and has spectral type f8 or later ) .",
    "we note that hip10679 composes a binary system with hip10680 and the latter object has been successfully recovered by our method .",
    "moreover , hip10679 could be also recovered when we applied the more accurate trigonometric parallax of hip10680 for this star as well .",
    "three new candidate stars , hd37144 , hd160305 and hd190102 , have been revealed",
    ". for hd37144 and hd190102 radial velocity data and lithium equivalent widths measured in the framework of the sacy survey @xcite have already been available .",
    "although the kinematic parameters fullfiled our criteria , the low values of the lithium equivalent widths did not confirm their membership .",
    "based on similar considerations , @xcite also rejected hd190102 as a member of bpmg . for hd160305",
    "no radial velocity or lithium data were found in the literature , thus this object was added to the list of candidates .",
    "for tha and eca we recovered all known members included in the hipparcos catalogue . as a result of our search we revealed one new tha candidate , hd25402 , for which radial velocity was available in the catalogue of @xcite . since its computed kinematic parameters correspond well to the characteristic values of tha we added this candidate to our list .",

    "however , according to the ucac3 catalogue @xcite , the proper motion of the proposed companion ( ccdm j04005 - 4145b , @xmath44mas , @xmath45mas ) deviates from the proper motion of hd25402 ( @xmath46mas , @xmath47mas ) , implying that a physical connection between these stars is unlikely . based on the current data we assign this star to the tha .",
    "we searched for new members of three young kinematic assemblages ( @xmath0pic moving group , @xmath1cha and tucana - horologium associations ) by combining radial velocity data from the rave survey with other astrometric information .",
    "we used strict selection criteria to filter out false candidates by requiring consistency with the colour - magnitude relationship and x - ray properties of the known members .",
    "in addition to recovering 10 known members of the three groups , we identified seven late - type ( k , m ) new candidates .",
    "this list was supplemented by two additional member candidates , hd25402 and hd160305 , that were selected from the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "utilizing our new high - resolution spectroscopic observations we found further pieces of evidence for the membership of our targets . as a result , we identified two new members ( 1 bpmg , 1 tha ) and seven likely members ( 1 eca , 5 bpmg , 1 tha ) of the groups .",
    "all stars , except tyc 7443 - 1102 - 1 and j19560294 - 3207186 , two likely bpmg members identified by @xcite , are new discoveries .",
    "these results demonstrate the potential of the rave survey in improving the census of young moving groups . using the same methods the searches can be extended for other moving groups as well",
    ". moreover , the final version of the rave catalogue will contain data for approximately three times more stars , offering a great opportunity for further steps towards a full census of young kinematic groups in the galactic neighbourhood .",
