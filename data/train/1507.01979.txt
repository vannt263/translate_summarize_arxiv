    "regardless of whether it is elastic or inelastic  implies symmetry breaking between the upper and lower portions of the unit cell along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "such breaking could be induced if some mn@xmath13 are antiferromagnetically aligned along @xmath9 ( which would double the magnetic unit cell ) , but both our work and theirs indicates that this is highly improbable .",
    "an alternative situation that would break the symmetry is the local population of mn@xmath0 in only one of the two interstitial voids of a unit cell , which removes the @xmath86 reflection condition .",
    "this latter possibility , where interstitial atoms do not necessarily occur in pairs in a given unit cell , was introduced earlier in the discussion of rietveld refinements ( section iii a ) .",
    "sb samples ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath6 ) ; container scattering has been subtracted from the data , which was collected at @xmath89@xmath90kev at a sample - to - detector distance of @xmath89@xmath91 cm .",
    "( b ) simulated diffraction patterns of mn@xmath47sb structures built from an infinite number of infinitely - wide discrete layers .",
    "when layers with a singly occupied mn@xmath0 site per unit cell are preferentially stacked adjacent to layers with mn@xmath0 in the same site , the correlated disorder gives rise to a diffuse feature that is consistent with the experimentally observed scattering in regards to both position ( in @xmath18 ) and relative intensity .",
    "cartoon models of the different structures giving rise to the simulated scattering are shown as four layer fragments ; mn@xmath13 ( pink ) , sb ( gray ) , mn@xmath0 ( blue ) . , width=316 ]    close examination of our x - ray scattering data reveals a weak diffuse component on top of the systematically absent ( 001 ) reflection that is suggestive of correlated structural disorder . in figure",
    "[ fig : diffuse]a we present the low-@xmath18 region of x - ray diffraction patterns for three mn@xmath1sb samples ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath6 ) , from which the container scattering has been subtracted .",
    "scattering intensities have been normalized to the most intense peak in the x - ray diffraction pattern of mn@xmath1sb [ _ i.e. _  the ( 101 ) reflection ] .",
    "the intensity of the diffuse signal increases with @xmath50 , and the maxima of the diffuse features are all observed at lower @xmath18 ( larger @xmath15-spacing ) than the center of the ( 001 ) reflection on the basis of the @xmath9 lattice constant . a shift of diffuse scattering maxima away from the associated bragg positions",
    "is commonly observed in situations of local structural dilation or contraction.@xcite    a series of simulations are presented in figure [ fig : diffuse]b that offer support to the hypothesis that the diffuse signal at low @xmath18 arises from correlated structural disorder associated with `` unpaired '' mn@xmath0 , that is , occupation of just one of the interstitial sites in a unit cell .",
    "diffraction patterns were generated with the diffax software@xcite  which explicitly computes the incoherent intensity contribution to a given @xmath92 reflection  for structures comprising random and correlated stacking variations of discrete layers .",
    "all simulations were conducted on the basis of the mn@xmath47sb stoichiometry and cell dimensions .    as a control diffax simulation ,",
    "a single - layer mn@xmath1sb model containing partially occupied mn@xmath0 in both of the interstitial sites was considered .",
    "this model is designated `` all mn@xmath0 paired '' in figure [ fig : diffuse]b , and it results in no noticeable scattering intensity at the ( 001 ) position .",
    "models containing unpaired mn@xmath0 were constructed with three distinct layer types : ( 1 ) a layer without any interstitial atoms , ( 2 ) a layer with a fully occupied interstitial atom in the lower interstitial void , and ( 3 ) a layer with a fully occupied interstitial atom in the upper interstitial void .",
    "two types of disorder were modeled for structures incorporating layers with singly occupied interstitial voids , namely random disorder and correlated disorder , as labeled in figure [ fig : diffuse ] . for the model containing layers with unpaired mn@xmath0 stacked in a completely random assortment ,",
    "no resolved diffuse intensity is generated at the ( 001 ) reflection .",
    "the rise in intensity at low @xmath18 is the result of the diffuse scattering from completely incoherent contributions , which emanate from ( 000 ) . on the other hand , for an unpaired mn@xmath0 model",
    "in which there is preferential stacking of the layers  correlated disorder  a well resolved diffuse signal near the ( 001 ) is generated .",
    "more specifically , the preferential stacking modeled here corresponds to an increased probability that a layer containing a single mn@xmath0 in one of the interstitial voids will neighbor layers that also contain mn@xmath0 in the same site .",
    "although this simulation represents a rather coarse example of one type of correlated disorder that could be present in mn@xmath1sb , it offers strong support for the presence of some degree of clustering associated with the interstitial atoms . as noted for the experimentally observed diffuse signal , the maximum of the diffuse component in the simulated pattern is also shifted to lower @xmath18 than the center of the ( 001 ) reflection .",
    "a single - crystal x - ray diffuse scattering study would be better suited to elucidating the origin of this observation .",
    "while these observations and simulations soundly establish the existence of short - range structural order , the specific nature of clustering in mn@xmath1sb remains an open question .",
    "consideration of the many plausible local arrangements is beyond the scope of the present work ; it is easily conceivable that a variety of short range - ordered motifs coexist .",
    "it is important to stress that although the presence of some unpaired mn@xmath0 is a requisite for generating nuclear scattering intensity near the ( 001 ) reflection , this does not imply the absence of local regions with pairs of interstitials .",
    "indeed , this type of diversity is represented in the dft supercells .",
    "a comparison of the relative supercell stabilities does not suggest an obvious penalty for interstitial proximity ( pairing ) , but because of their relatively small sizes and construction by stochastic population of the interstitial sites it would be conjecture to suggest an energetic preference for any particular type of clustering .    in summary ,",
    "the observation of a diffuse signal consistent with the symmetry - forbidden ( 001 ) reflection suggests that the diffuse magnetic component observed by taylor _",
    "et al . _",
    "by inelastic neutron scattering is rooted in short - range structural order .",
    "this explanation is further supported by our density functional studies , which challenge previous notions@xcite that mn@xmath0 induces a significant reduction in neighboring mn@xmath13 moments .",
    "analysis of x - ray total scattering data collected on polycrystalline powders of mn@xmath1sb ( @xmath2 ) reveals signatures of structural relaxation associated with the accommodation of interstitial atoms .",
    "in particular , the trigonal bipyramidal site of mn@xmath0 is better described by longer equatorial mn@xmath0sb distances than reflected by the crystallographic unit cell .",
    "density functional relaxation of large supercells for compositions close to @xmath4 , @xmath93 , and @xmath6 , provides excellent structural descriptions of the short - range disorder induced by mn@xmath0 , evidenced by improved fits to the experimental pdfs .",
    "relaxation has a pronounced effect on the calculated moment of mn@xmath0 , which aligns antiparallel to mn@xmath13 , but our results suggest that mn@xmath0 has effectively no influence on the moments of mn@xmath13 in proximity to interstitials .",
    "the observation of a diffuse signal near the ( 001 ) reflection position , which is systematically absent when mn@xmath0 is distributed completely randomly , indicates that some degree of _ correlated _ disorder exists in mn@xmath1sb .",
