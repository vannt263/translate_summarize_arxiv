    "<S> numerical evidences of this many - body transition were reported for spins models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the localized phase could persist at infinite temperature for strong enough disorder  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this lack of thermalization is expected to have consequences in the time evolution of the von neumann entropy of one halve of the system . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the infinite time entropy saturates with the size of the system in the absence of interactions  @xcite . intuitively , localization prevents the system to explore a significant part of the available states in the microcanonical ensemble .    </S>",

    "<S> it has been argued that the proportionality constant is small to allow thermalization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one may also think that a logarithmic growth is rather slow for an usual thermal state . here , we show that long - range interactions produce a faster , power law , evolution of the entropy in a localized system . </S>",

    "<S> regarding nearest - neighbors hopping , they conclude the existence of a many - body localized phase for coulomb and dipolar interactions in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by their numerical data in the dipolar case . </S>",
    "<S> we will present results which also indicates a many - body localized phase for both types of interactions at high energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of entropy has been analyzed for models with ising- and xxz - like long - range interactions , but without disorder  @xcite . in those cases , </S>",
    "<S> entanglement growth is usually due to pseudo - particles carrying information between far apart regions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that , even in the case of delocalized excitations , entropy spread could be faster than pseudo - particle propagation as reported by huse  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pseudo - particles can not be the responsible of entropy growth when localization takes place . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is remarkable that we find a fast spread in many - body localized system </S>",

    "<S> indeed , the localization length , which can be obtained from the decay of the correlations , is the same for all the cases @xmath24 . as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , our numerical simulations support the existence of a many - body localized phase for long - range interactions for @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> .      we study the regime in which all the eigenstates of the non - interacting system are strongly localized , with localization length similar to the lattice spacing , @xmath24 . </S>",

    "<S> we analyze the time evolution of two far away particle in an initial disentangled state : @xmath40 . </S>",

    "<S> our analysis is similar to the one performed for local interactions in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which the corrections to the relevant energies are @xmath59 with @xmath60 real numbers . in this case , the dephasing time increases exponentially with the distance between particles . </S>",
    "<S> we see that long - range interactions produce a much quicker dephasing and then , faster entropy growth .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate time evolution of a particle in the left halve of the system , in a state @xmath61 , which interacts with many other far apart localized particles at the right halve , which are in states @xmath62 for @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> the energy of @xmath68 is up to first order @xmath69 . using similar arguments as for the evolution of two particles : @xmath70 again , only the analogous to dipole - dipole interaction entangles the particle at left with the rest of the system , but now this particle interacts with many other . </S>",
    "<S> a estimation of the dephasing time can be obtained by taking an uniform distribution of particles on the right halve . </S>",
    "<S> then , the summation of the dipole - dipole interactions can be performed as an integral . for a large system </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a rough estimation of the dephasing time as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the distance between particle at left and the first particle at right .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we can understand the general evolution starting from a disentangled state @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> as the strongly localized regime is considered , this state can be approximated as a slater determinant in which each electron is in a superposition of a few nearby localized single - particle eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> after a time @xmath74 , each particle closer to the right halve than a distance @xmath75 , which is of the order of @xmath76 , is effectively entangled . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the entropy of the left halve of the system is proportional to the number of particles entangled with the right halve , we deduce : @xmath77 this formula has been obtained by analyzing the most relevant time scales in which dephasing occurs . </S>",

    "<S> the re - scaled entropy of small system is underestimated at large times due to finite size corrections . the data for sizes @xmath17 and @xmath82 are not compatible for the first time at @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> finite size effects are relevant after that time for the curve @xmath82 . at early times , the evolution of entropy , @xmath79 , is not due to many - body effects . </S>",
    "<S> it is because of diffusion at small distances and does not depend on the size of the system . </S>",
