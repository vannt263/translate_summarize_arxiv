    "<S> the recombination term @xmath86_{\\rm rec}= -n\\sum_qw^{++}_{kq}\\rho_w(x , k)\\rho_w(x , q)$ ] also becomes small in this range , because the number of fermions becomes small .    from the above arguments , using the fact that the distribution over fermion momentum is of the maxwell - boltzmann form , we obtain a standard generation - recombination equation for the spatially - averaged fermion density @xmath90 , @xmath91 here , @xmath92 </S>",

    "<S> the mean density @xmath90 can not follow this decrease , so that the density of fermions becomes higher than the thermal density . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath79 become important . </S>",
    "<S> they impose a bottleneck on the recombination in one - dimensional systems @xcite , because for fermions to recombine they first have to come close to each other . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the usually studied reaction - diffusion systems , in the present case the bottleneck arises not because of the decrease of the density , but , in the first place , because of the falloff of the diffusion coefficient .    </S>",
    "<S> once the recombination becomes limited by diffusion , the change of the fermion density becomes even slower than in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : n ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we stop decreasing @xmath88 where thermal generation can be disregarded , it will take time @xmath113 for the density to become @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> if we then make @xmath115 , the system will be in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> thus the overall time to find a global minimum of the optimization problem will be @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not our goal .    </S>",
    "<S> the density @xmath117 where there occurs the crossover to diffusion - limited recombination gives an approximate solution of the qa . </S>",
    "<S> it is this solution that we are interested in . </S>",
    "<S> as we show , it can be reached in time that is independent of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> one can estimate @xmath118 by setting equal the rates @xmath119 calculated for the recombination and diffusion processes . for the recombination </S>",
    "<S> , one can use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : generation_recombination ] ) written for the local density @xmath79 . for the diffusion , one can use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) where the mean inter - particle distance @xmath120 is chosen as a scale on which the density fluctuates . an alternative way of estimating @xmath118 for a time - dependent diffusion coefficient is described in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> iv of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the result reads @xmath121 where @xmath122 .    </S>",
    "<S> equations ( [ eq : nonthermal ] ) - ( [ eq : n_star ] ) relate the crossover value of @xmath123 to the value @xmath104 where thermal equilibrium is broken . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to write them for the scaled distances from the critical value @xmath28 , which are given by @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath126    equations ( [ eq : nonthermal ] ) , ( [ eq : n ] ) , and ( [ eq : x_variables ] ) express the crossover density @xmath118 in terms of the speed of the change of the control parameter @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> unexpectedly , the dependence of @xmath118 on @xmath30 is nonmonotonic , see fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to minimize @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal value @xmath128 is    @xmath129    where @xmath130 is the value of @xmath131 where @xmath118 is minimal ; @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal speed @xmath133 is related to this value of @xmath134 by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : nonthermal ] ) , @xmath135    the above analysis applies for @xmath136 and @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the optimal speed of the algorithm is somewhat smaller than @xmath133 , and the value of @xmath118 that can be reached is slightly higher than @xmath138 , see fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , eq .  ( [ eq : x _ * ] ) gives the characteristic scaling of the minimal @xmath118 and the optimal velocity with the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that @xmath138 is extremely small for weak coupling , @xmath10 , and low temperatures , @xmath139 , and it rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath140 and @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the optimal speed @xmath133 is independent of the size of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to compare the optimal speed with the speed @xmath142 that would lead to the same density @xmath143 due to the kibble - zurek mechanism of creation of excitations in the absence of coupling to the environment . from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : kzm ] ) and ( [ eq : v_opt ] ) , @xmath144 therefore the time it takes to reach the approximate solution ( [ eq : x _ * ] ) in a closed quantum system is much larger than in our case .    . </S>",
    "<S> the black line shows the nonequilibrium density @xmath90 for @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath30=@xmath133=2.85 @xmath147 10@xmath148 , see eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the blue point marks the crossover value @xmath149 . for @xmath150 spatial correlations become strong and the theory is inapplicable . in ( b ) , the red , blue , green and black lines show the scaled density @xmath151 vs. the scaled qa rate @xmath152 for @xmath153 , respectively [ parameter @xmath154 is defined in ( [ eq : x_variables ] ) ] . the minimal density @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed sections of the lines refer to the regions where the asymptotic theory does not apply.,width=336 ]    it is instructive also to compare @xmath133 with the speed of annealing based on the classical glauber dynamics @xcite . in this dynamics , for low temperatures , @xmath139 , excitations in the ising spin chain </S>",
    "<S> are eliminated through diffusion of kinks . </S>",
    "<S> if the transition rate for a kink to move to a neighboring site is @xmath155 and the initial density of the kinks is @xmath156 , the time @xmath157 to reach density @xmath158 is @xmath159 @xcite . in terms of our model , the uncertainty relation imposes a limitation @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the ratio of the times to reach @xmath138 via classical and quantum diffusion is very large , @xmath161 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate that quantum diffusion near the critical point provides an important mechanism of the speedup of qa . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bottleneck of qa in an open system can be imposed by the sharp slowing down of the diffusion near the critical region . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover to slow excitation recombination is accompanied by the onset of significant spatial fluctuations of the excitation density even in the absence of disorder . at the crossover , </S>",
    "<S> the distance to the critical value of the transverse field and the residual density of excitations non - monotonically depend on the quantum annealing rate . </S>",
    "<S> their minimum provides the optimal value of the rate . </S>",
    "<S> this value scales with the coupling constant and temperature as @xmath162 , the optimal excitation density is @xmath163 , and the distance to the critical value of the transverse field is @xmath164 .    </S>",
    "<S> for our simple but nontrivial example of qa , attaining the approximate solution @xcite via the quantum - diffusion mediated process is faster than via classical diffusion or the closed - system qa . </S>",
    "<S> one might expect that , in higher - dimensional systems , quantum diffusion over extended states could provide a route to finding approximate solutions in the presence of disorder .    </S>",
