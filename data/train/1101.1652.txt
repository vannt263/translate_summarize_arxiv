    "the tauola package @xcite for the simulation of @xmath0-lepton decays and photos @xcite for the simulation of qed radiative corrections in decays , are computing projects with a rather long history . written and maintained by well - defined ( main ) authors , they nonetheless migrated into a wide range of applications where they became ingredients of complicated simulation chains . as a consequence ,",
    "a large number of different versions are presently in use .",
    "those modifications , especially in case of tauola , are valuable from the physics point of view , often did not found the place in the distributed versions of the program .",
    "even if from the algorithmic point of view , versions differ only in details , they incorporate many specific results from distinct @xmath0-lepton measurements or phenomenological projects .",
    "such versions were mainly maintained ( and will remain so ) by the experiments taking precision data on @xmath0 leptons .",
    "interesting from the physics point of view changes are expected to be developped in fortran .",
    "that is why , significant part of the tauola should remain in fortran for the forthcoming several years .",
    "however many new applications were developed recently , often requiring a program interface to other packages ( e.g. generating events for lhc , lc , belle or babar physics processes ) .",
    "fortunately , co - existence with c++ is not a problem , at least not from the software point of view .",
    "the programs structure , prepared for the convenience of fortran users , was presented during previous @xmath0 conferences , and we will not repeat it here .",
    "this time , let us concentrate on new interfaces for applications based on hepmc @xcite event record .",
    "we will also report on progress in implementation ( re - implementation ) of techniques useful for fits .",
    "analyses of high precision , high statistic data from belle and babar are expected to progress from these solutions .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows : section 2 is devoted to new interfaces of tauola and photos to hepmc applications of c++ , where genuine weak and transverse spin effects can be taken into account as well .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the discussion of optional weights in tauola and their use for fits to data at the level of comparison with raw data .",
    "progress on the work on new currents for hardonic decays which can be confronted with ( tuned to ) data using such optional weights enabling simultaneous control of all experimental effects is mentioned too . in section 4",
    "we present some new results for photos monte carlo for radiative corrections in decays .",
    "section 5 is devoted to mc - tester , the program which can be used for semi - automatic comparisons of simulation samples originating from different programs .",
    "because of the limited space of the contribution , and sizable amount of other physically interesting results , some of them will be excluded from conference proceedings",
    ". they will find place in future works , possibly with collaborators mentioned in the abstract .",
    "for these works , the present paper may serve as an announcement .",
    "in the development of packages such as tauola or photos , questions of tests and appriopriate relations to users applications are essential for their usefulness .",
    "in fact , user applications may be much larger in size and human effort , than the programs discussed here .",
    "good example of such ` user applications ' are complete environments to simulate physics process and control detector response at the same time .",
    "distributions of final state particles distributions are not always of direct interest",
    ". often properties of intermediate states such as spin state of @xmath0-lepton , coupling constants or masses of intermedate heavy particles are of prime interest . as a consequence",
    "it is useful that such intermediate state properties are under direct control of the experimental user and can be manipulated to understand detector responses .",
    "our programs worked well with fortran applications where hepevt event record was used .",
    "now , for the c++ hepmc @xcite case , interfaces had to be re - written , both for tauola @xcite and photos @xcite .",
    "the interfaces are gradually enriched and for example for the photos improved kernel , is already available for the general use , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite . a complete ( not longitudinal only ) spin correlations are available for @xmath1 decay in tauola interface now .",
    "they are based on electroweak corrections taken from refs .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ relations ] for the scheme of programs communications .",
    "the size of the electroweak effects on longitudinal @xmath0 polarization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : poldown ] .",
    "such modular organization opens ways for efficient algorithms to understand detector systematics , but at the same time responsability to control software precision must be shared by the user .",
    "for that purpose automatization of tests mc - tester was prepared  @xcite .",
    "new functionalities were introduced into the testing package @xcite . in particular",
    ", it works now with the hepmc event record , the standard of c++ programs and the spectrum of available tests is enriched .",

    "physics of @xmath0 lepton decays requires sophisticated strategies for the confrontation of phenomenological models with experimental data . on one hand",
    "high statistics experimental samples are collected , and the obtained precision is high , on the other hand , there is a significant cross - contamination between distinct @xmath0 decay channels . starting from a certain precision level",
    "all channels need to be analyzed simultaneously .",
    "change of parametrization for one channel contribution to the background may be important for the fit of another one .",
    "this situation leads to a complex configuation where a multitude of parameters ( and models ) needs to be simultaneously confronted with a multitude of observables .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the models used to obtain distributions in the fits may require refinements or even substantial rebuilds as a consequence of comparison with the data .",
    "the topic was covered in detail in the @xmath0 section of ref .",
    "@xcite earlier this year .    from the statistical point of view",
    "it is best to resolve such system in one automated step using for example a method such as @xcite .",
    "this can be of course very dangerous from the point of view of systematic error control .",
    "but we will not elaborate on this point any further . from the technical point it is necessary , to calculate for each generated event ( for each present in it : decay of @xmath2 and @xmath3 separately ) alternative weights ; the ratios of matrix element squared obtained with new currents provided by the user , and",
    "the one actually used in generation . then the vector of weights can be obtained and used in fits .",
    "we have checked that such a solution not only can be easily installed into tauola as a stand - alone generator but it can also be incorporated into the simulation frameworks of belle and babar collaborations rather easily .",
    "the scheme as given in fig .",

    "a dedicated patch is being prepared , to be later installed into users software environments .",
    "thanks to exponentation properties and factorization , the bulk of the final state qed bremsstrahlung can be described in a universal way .",
    "howevers , the kinematical configurations caused by qed bremsstrahlung are affecting in an important way signal / background separation .",
    "it may affect selection criteria and background contaminations in quite complex and unexpected ways .",
    "in many applications , not only in @xmath0 decays , such bremsstrahlung corrections are generated with the help of the photos monte carlo .",
    "that is why it is of importance to review the precision of this program as documented in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the c++ applications ,",
    "the first version of the program is also available now , it is documented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in c++ applications ,",
    "the complete first order matrix element for the two body decays of the @xmath4 into pair of charged leptons @xcite is now available .",
    "kernels with complete matrix elements , for the decays of scalar @xmath5 mesons into a pair of scalars @xcite , for @xmath6 and for @xmath7 @xcite are available for tests or specially oriented decay particles frames",
    ". it will be rather easy now to integrate nlo kernels into the main version of the program , because of better control of decay particle rest frame than in the fortran interface .    in all of these cases the universal kernel of photos",
    "is replaced with the one matching exact first order matrix element . in this way terms",
    "necessary for nlo / nll precision level are implemented .",
    "a discussion relevant for control of program systematic uncetainty in @xmath8 decay can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the algorithm covers the full multiphoton phase - space and becomes exact in the soft limit .",
    "this is rather unusual for nll compatible algorithms .",
    "one should not forget that photos generates weight - one events too , and does not require any phase space ordering .",
    "there is a full phase space overlap between the one where hard matrix element is used and the one for iterative photon emissions .",
    "all interference effects ( between consecutive emissions and emissions from distinct charged lines ) are implemented with the help of internal weights .",
    "the results of all tests of photos with a nlo kernel confirm sub - permille precision level .",
    "this is very encouraging , and points to the possible extension of the approach outside of qed ( scalar qed ) . in particular to the domain of qcd or",
    "if phenomenological lagrangians for interactions of photons need to be applied . for that work",

    "generated events have to be stored in event records : be it of fortran or c++ . default distributions consist of all possible invariant masses which are automatically generated and stored for each found decay channel of the particle under test .",
