    "quantum operations are given by normal completely positive maps transforming the observables of the output system into observables of the input system , with the condition that each quantum operation is upper bounded by a unital completely positive map .",
    "a quantum supermap is then a higher - order linear map that transforms quantum operations into quantum operations .",
    "the theory of quantum supermaps has proven to be a powerful tool for the treatment of many advanced topics in quantum information theory @xcite , including in particular the optimal cloning and the optimal learning of unitary transformations @xcite and quantum measurements @xcite .",
    "moreoever , quantum supermaps are interesting for the foundations of quantum mechanics as they are the possible dynamics in a toy model of non - causal theory @xcite .",
    "a particular type of quantum supermaps has been considered by zyczkowski @xcite , who used them to construct a theory with a state space that has a quartic relation between the number of distinguishable states and the number of parameters needed to specify a state .",
    "quantum supermaps also attracted interest in the mathematical physics literature , as they suggested the study of a general class of completely positive maps between convex subsets of the state space @xcite .",
    "originally , the definition and the main theorems on quantum supermaps were presented by dariano , perinotti , and one of the authors in the context of full matrix algebras describing finite dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",
    "an extension of the theory that includes both classical and quantum systems has been exposed informally in @xcite , still in the finite dimensional setting . however , a rigorous definition and characterization of quantum supermaps in infinite dimension and for arbitrary von neumann algebras is still lacking",
    ". this problem will be the main focus of the present paper .    before presenting our results",
    ", we briefly review the definition and characterization of supermaps for full matrix algebras .",
    "quantum supermaps are defined axiomatically as linear completely positive maps transforming quantum operations into quantum operations ( see @xcite for the physical motivation of linearity and complete positivity ) .",
    "a quantum supermap is _ deterministic _ if it transforms quantum channels ( i.e.  unital completely positive maps , see e.g.  @xcite ) into quantum channels .",
    "references @xcite proved the following dilation theorem for deterministic supermaps : denoting by @xmath0 and @xmath1 the @xmath2-algebras of linear operators on the finite dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and writing @xmath5 for the set of completely positive maps sending @xmath0 into @xmath1 , we have that any deterministic supermap @xmath6 transforming quantum operations in @xmath7 to quantum operations in @xmath8 has the following form : @xmath9 ( a ) = v_1^\\ast \\left[({\\mathcal{e}}\\otimes { \\mathcal{i}}_{{\\mathcal{v}}_1 } ) ( v_2^\\ast ( a\\otimes i_{{\\mathcal{v}}_2 } ) v_2 ) \\right ] v_1 \\quad \\forall a\\in { \\mathcal{l } ( { \\mathcal{h}}_2 ) } \\ ] ] for all @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two ancillary finite dimensional hilbert spaces , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are isometries , @xmath15 is the identity map on @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the identity operator on @xmath12 . in the schrdinger ( or predual ) picture",
    ", this result shows that the most general way to transform a quantum operation is achieved by connecting the corresponding device in a quantum circuit consisting in the following sequence of operations :    1 .",
    "apply an invertible transformation ( corresponding to the isometry @xmath18 ) , which transforms the system @xmath19 into the composite system @xmath20 ; 2 .   use the input device on system @xmath21 , thus transforming it into system @xmath22 ;",
    "in the schrdinger picture the action of the device will correspond to a set of predual quantum operations @xmath23 transforming states on @xmath21 into states on @xmath22 ; 3 .   apply an invertible transformation ( corresponding to the isometry @xmath24 ) , which transforms the composite system @xmath25 into the composite system @xmath26 ; 4 .   discard system @xmath12 ( mathematically , take the partial trace over @xmath12 ) .",
    "in this paper we will extend eq .   and the other results of @xcite to the case where the input spaces @xmath27 of the quantum operations are replaced by arbitrary separable von neumann algebras and the outputs @xmath28",
    "also are allowed to be infinite dimensional .",
    "the usefulness of this extension for applications is twofold : on the one hand , it removes the restriction to finite dimensional quantum systems and provides the natural generalization of quantum supermaps to the infinite dimensional case ; on the other hand , replacing the input algebras @xmath27 with generic separable von neumann algebras , it allows us to include transformations of quantum measuring devices , which are described in the schrdinger picture by maps from the algebra of bounded operators on the hilbert space of the measured system to the commutative algebra of functions on the outcome space .",
    "the supermaps defined in this paper are thus able to describe tasks like ` measuring a measurement ' @xcite , where one tries to measure properties of a quantum measuring device by inserting it in a suitable circuit .    in trying to extend eq .   to the infinite dimensional setting , one encounters two key differences with respect to the finite dimensional case .",
    "the first difference concerns the domain of definition of quantum supermaps .",
    "clearly , the natural domain for a quantum supermap is the linear space spanned by quantum operations .",
    "however , while in finite dimensions quantum operations in @xmath29 span the whole set of linear maps from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , in infinite dimension they only span the _ proper _ subset @xmath30 of weak*-continuous completely bounded linear maps , which is even smaller than the set of bounded linear maps from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "the second key difference concerns the necessary and sufficient conditions needed for the proof of the dilation theorem .",
    "indeed , not every deterministic quantum supermap admits a dilation of the form of eq .   in the infinite dimensional case .",
    "we will prove that such a dilation exists if and only if the deterministic supermap @xmath6 is _ normal _ , in a suitable sense that will be defined later . under the normality hypothesis",
    ", a natural algebraic construction leads to our dilation theorem ( theorem [ teo .",
    "centr . ] ) for deterministic supermaps , which is the main result of the paper .",
    "this result can be compared with analogous results in the theory of operator spaces @xcite , which , however , though being more general , are much less specialized than ours and imply it only in trivial cases ( see remark [ rem : opspa2 ] in section [ sez .",
    "stine ] for a brief discussion ) .",
    "our second result is a radon - nikodym theorem for probabilistic supermaps , namely supermaps that are dominated by deterministic supermaps .",
    "the class of probabilistic supermaps is particularly interesting for physical applications , as such maps naturally appear in the description of quantum circuits that are designed to test properties of physical devices @xcite .",
    "higher - order quantum measurements are indeed described by _",
    "quantum superinstruments _ , which are the generalization of the quantum instruments of davies and lewis @xcite .",
    "the third main result of the paper then will be the proof of a dilation theorem for quantum superinstruments , in analogy with ozawa s dilation theorem for ordinary instruments @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sez .",
    "] we fix the elementary definitions and notations , and state or recall some basic facts needed in the rest of the paper . in particular , in section [ sez .",

    "section [ sez .",

    "the dilation theorem for quantum superinstruments is finally applied in section [ subsect : measmeas ] to show how every abstract superinstrument describing a measurement on a quantum measuring device can be realized in a circuit .",

    "@xmath972_\\ast   ( \\rho )   =   [ { \\mathcal{j}}_{b\\,\\ast } ( { \\mathcal{e}}\\otimes { \\mathcal{i}}_{\\mathcal{v}})_\\ast](v\\rho v^\\ast ) = \\sum_{i\\in x } { \\mathcal{j}}_{i , b \\,\\ast } [ ( { \\mathcal{e}}\\otimes { \\mathcal{i}}_{\\mathcal{v}})_\\ast ( v\\rho v^\\ast)_i ] \\ , , \\ ] ] holding for all states @xmath1008 , we then see that the most general measurement on a quantum measuring device can be implemented by    1 .   applying an invertible dynamics ( the isometry @xmath861 that transforms the input system @xmath19 into the composite system @xmath862 , where @xmath370 is an ancillary system ; 2 .   performing the given measurement @xmath142 on @xmath21 , thus obtaining the outcome @xmath991 ; 3 .   conditionally to the outcome @xmath864 , performing a quantum measurement ( the predual instrument @xmath1009 ) , thus obtaining an outcome in @xmath927 and transforming the ancillary system @xmath370 into the classical system described by the commutative algebra @xmath1010 .    if we assume that the set @xmath927 also is countable , then the instrument @xmath1011 is completely specified by its action on singleton sets , that is , by the countable set of quantum operations @xmath1012 . in this case , if for all @xmath991 we define @xmath1013 then the map @xmath1014 is a normalized povm on the product set @xmath1015 and with values in @xmath853 .",
    "note that , in terms of the povm @xmath1016 , we can express each @xmath1017 as @xmath1018 or , equivalently , @xmath1019 in other words , the step ( 3 ) in the measurement process can be interpreted as a quantum measurement with outcome @xmath1020 , where only the classical information concerning the index @xmath1021 is encoded in a physical system available for future experiments , whereas the information concerning index @xmath1022 becomes unavailable after being read out by the experimenter .",
