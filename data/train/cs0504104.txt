    "node @xmath76 is a 1-point cluster .",
    "all other distances are defined by shortest - path lengths in @xmath73 .",
    "first , we show that , for @xmath69 , will end up with the facility at @xmath75 . indeed ,",
    "will first remove all but one facility from each cluster . without loss of generality ,",
    "let those remaining facilities be located at the nodes of @xmath73 , and from now on we will think of @xmath84 as the weight of each node in layer @xmath49 .",
    "at the next step , we break ties so that will remove the facility from @xmath76 .",
    "we claim that in any subsequent step @xmath85 , if @xmath49 is the first layer that has a facility , then has a facility on each node of @xmath74 in layers @xmath86 . to prove it ,",

    "if a node @xmath15 in layer @xmath49 has a facility then , by the invariant , this facility serves all the nodes in the subtree @xmath87 of @xmath74 rooted at @xmath15 , plus possibly @xmath76 ( if @xmath15 has the last facility in layer @xmath49 . )",
    "what facility will be removed by at this step ?",
    "the cost of removing any facility from layers @xmath86 is at least @xmath88 .",
    "if we remove the facility from @xmath15 , all the nodes served by @xmath15 can switch to the parent of @xmath15 , so the increase in cost is bounded by the total weight of @xmath87 ( possibly plus one , if @xmath15 serves @xmath76 . )",
    "@xmath87 has @xmath89 nodes in each layer @xmath90 .",
    "so the total weight of @xmath87 is @xmath91 where the inequality above follows from @xmath92 . thus removing @xmath15 increases the cost by at most @xmath93 ,",
    "so will remove @xmath15 or some other node from layer @xmath49 in this step , as claimed . therefore , overall , after @xmath94 steps , will be left with the facility at @xmath75 .    by the previous paragraph",
    ", the cardinality ( total weight ) of @xmath16 is @xmath95 , so @xmath96 .",
    "the optimal cost is @xmath97 while the cost of is @xmath98 where in the last step we estimate the sum by the first term .",
    "thus the ratio is @xmath99 .    in the argument above we considered only the case @xmath69 .",
    "more generally , one might characterize the performance ratio of the algorithm as a function of both @xmath68 and @xmath0 .",
    "any lower bound for @xmath69 implies a lower bound for larger @xmath0 by simply taking @xmath0 ( widely separated ) copies of the metric space .",
    "therefore we obtain :    the approximation ratio of algorithm   in metric spaces is not better than @xmath70 .",
    "we have shown an @xmath2 upper bound and an @xmath100 lower bound on the approximation ratio of for @xmath0-medians in metric spaces .",
    "next we make some observations about what it might take to improve our bounds .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath69 .      in the upper bound proof in section  [ sec : the upper bound ] we show that the incremental cost of when removing @xmath50 from @xmath51 to obtain @xmath52 is at most @xmath101 , where @xmath76 denotes the optimal @xmath79-median .",
    "the proof ( inequalities ( [ eqn : ub1 ] ) through ( [ eqn : ub3 ] ) ) does nt use any information about the structure of @xmath51 : it shows that for _ any _ set @xmath38 of size @xmath49 , @xmath102 next we describe a set @xmath38 of size @xmath49 in a metric space for which this latter bound is tight .",
    "the metric space is defined by the following weighted graph :        the space has points @xmath76 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , where the points @xmath105 have weights @xmath106 , for some large integer @xmath106 .",
    "( in other words , each @xmath105 represents a cluster of @xmath106 points at distance @xmath71 from each other . )",
    "all other points have weight @xmath79 .",
    "point @xmath76 is connected to each @xmath105 by an edge of length @xmath79 .",
    "each @xmath105 is connected to @xmath107 by an edge of length @xmath79 , and to each @xmath108 , for @xmath109 , by an edge of length @xmath110 .",
    "the distances are measured along the edges of this graph .    for @xmath69 ,",
    "the optimal cost is @xmath111 .",
    "now consider @xmath112 .",
    "removing any @xmath113 increases the cost by @xmath114 .",
    "thus , for this example , inequality ( [ eqn : general inequality ] ) is tight , up to a constant factor of about 2 .",
    "of course , would not produce the particular set @xmath38 assumed above for @xmath51 .",
    "also , this example only shows a _ single iteration _ where the incremental cost matches the upper bound ( [ eqn : general inequality ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , the example demonstrates that to improve the upper bound it is necessary to consider some information about the structure of @xmath51 ( due to the previous steps of ) .",
    "fix a metric space @xmath3 with @xmath68 points , where @xmath68 is a large integer .",
    "let @xmath76 be the @xmath79-median of @xmath16 , and assume ( by scaling ) that its cost is @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath116 be the unit ball around @xmath76 , that is , the set of points at distance at most @xmath79 from @xmath76 .",
    "note that @xmath117 .    for @xmath118 ,",
    "define @xmath119 to be the points @xmath12 such that @xmath120 , and such that there is a time when @xmath15 is used by as a facility for some point in @xmath116 .",
    "thus @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "also , for @xmath123 , let @xmath124 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the maximum index for which @xmath125 .",
    "define @xmath126 to be the time step when is about to remove the last facility from @xmath127 , and for @xmath128 let @xmath129 be the number of points served by @xmath130 at time @xmath131 .",
    "( the value of @xmath132 is not critical ; any constant @xmath133 will work , with some minor modifications . )",
    "we first argue that @xmath137 can not happen for more than four consecutive values of @xmath138 .",
    "indeed , @xmath139 .",
    "assume , towards a contradiction , that @xmath140 and that @xmath141 . then at step @xmath142 , deletes the last facility @xmath143 , its cost to serve @xmath76 increases by at least 4 and its cost to serve @xmath116 increases by more than @xmath144 .",
    "let @xmath145 be such that @xmath146 . by lemma  [ lemma : main ]",
    ", deleting a facility @xmath147 at time @xmath142 would increase the cost by at most @xmath148 , hence less than the cost of deleting @xmath149 at time @xmath142  contradicting the definition of .",
    "now , consider any @xmath150 .",

    "suppose @xmath157 .",
    "since @xmath158 , the facilities in @xmath159 serve at most @xmath129 clients . therefore , at step @xmath85 , deleting _ all _ facilities in @xmath159 and serving their clients using a remaining facility from @xmath160 would have increased the cost by @xmath161 , by the triangle inequality .",
    "so there exists a facility @xmath162 in @xmath159 whose deletion at step @xmath85 would have increased the cost by @xmath163 . since at time",

    "the intuition is that for this sum to be bounded by a constant , the cardinalities @xmath168 must rapidly decrease ( except for some small number of abnormalities ) and @xmath77 can not be too large . to get a good estimate ,",
    "let @xmath169 , for @xmath170 .",
    "then , @xmath171 where the next - to - last inequality holds because @xmath172 for all @xmath173 .",
    "( here , again , we use the fact that at most four consecutive @xmath174 s can be zero . )",

    "we have @xmath177 .",
    "therefore @xmath178 for all except at most @xmath179 @xmath165 s .",
    "so there are @xmath180 and @xmath181 such that @xmath178 for all @xmath182 . for those @xmath165 s we get @xmath183 let @xmath184 .",
    "then @xmath185 is maximized when all @xmath186 are equal to @xmath187 , and therefore @xmath188 thus @xmath189 , and we obtain @xmath190 , completing the proof .",
    "note that assumption of the lemma holds for the metric space used in section  [ sec : the lower bound ] .",
    "there , each set @xmath119 , for @xmath191 , consists of the nodes in @xmath74 at level @xmath165 , and @xmath192 is the total weight of level @xmath165 so , indeed , @xmath193 .",
    "the lemma suggests that in order to improve the lower bound , one would need to design an example where at every time @xmath142 , the facilities serving nodes at distance at most @xmath165 from @xmath76 are distributed more or less uniformly across the remaining facilities ."
