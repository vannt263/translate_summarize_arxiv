    "insight into the physical properties of jets in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is dependent on identifying the emission mechanism responsible for the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "this is an unsolved problem , where no theoretical model has yet managed to explain the full range of observed parameters for the smoothly broken power - law shape of the spectra .",
    "in particular , it is well known that synchrotron emission can not explain the hard low - energy slopes of many bursts @xcite , while the majority of grb spectra are significantly wider than expected for the simplest cases of thermal emission from the jet photosphere . from observations with",
    "there is growing evidence that emission from the jet photosphere is important in at least some bursts , although it is usually seen to co - exist with a dominant non - thermal component @xcite .    due to the difficulties in discriminating between different emission models , observations of grb spectra which are close to pure planck functions are very important .",
    "there have previously been a few grbs with such spectra observed by batse @xcite as well as one observed by gbm @xcite . for these bursts",
    ", however , the redshifts and radiative efficiencies are unknown , leading to uncertainties in the absolute values of outflow parameters derived from the spectral fits . here",
    "we present observations of grb  101219b , the first grb with a spectrum that is well described by a planck function that also has a detected afterglow and a known redshift .",
    "the prompt emission of was observed by both burst alert telescope ( bat ) and gbm @xcite , and the afterglow was detected from x - rays to optical energies by several observatories @xcite .",
    "the optical signature of an accompanying supernova ( sn ) was also detected @xcite and the redshift was determined to be 0.55 .",
    "an analysis of the sn spectrum by @xcite showed it to be a broad - line type ic , with properties similar to sn  1998bw , the archetypal grb - sn @xcite .",
    "in addition , the xrt spectra of the early afterglow revealed the presence of a highly significant bb component @xcite .",
    "such a component has also been found in a small number of other grbs and the origin has been attributed variously to the sn shock breakout , emission from the cocoon surrounding the jet , or late emission from the jet itself @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows : we present the spectral analysis of the gamma - ray observations in section [ gammaobs ] , estimate the radiative efficiency from the xrt observations in section [ effic ] and derive the outflow parameters in section [ fireball ] .",
    "we discuss our results in section [ discussion ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat universe with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "error bars correspond to 1 sigma unless otherwise stated .",
    "in the analysis of the prompt phase of we focus on the data from gbm @xcite , which has a stronger signal as well as a wider energy range than the bat . we do check the bat data for consistency though .",
    "is a relatively weak burst with a fluence of @xmath6 in the @xmath7  kev energy band and duration @xmath8  s ( @xcite ) .",
    "the light curve of the nai detectors ( @xmath9  kev ) is dominated by a single peak , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] .    for the spectral analysis we use the nai  3 , 6 and 7 detectors , which all have angles with respect to the burst of .",
    "there is no signal in the bgo detectors ( 200 kev - 40 mev ) or in the large area telescope ( lat , 30  mev - 300  gev ) .",
    "the fits were performed using xspec  v12.8.1 and pgstat statistics . to select time intervals for the spectral analysis we binned the light curve using the bayesian blocks technique ( as implemented in astroml , @xcite ) , which resulted in two time intervals , shown in fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] .",
    "grbs are typically well described by the so - called band function @xcite , which is a smoothly broken power law characterized by a peak energy ( @xmath10 ) and power - law indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 below and above the peak , respectively .",
    "the results from fitting with a band function are listed in table  [ fitparams ] .",
    "the fits show that @xmath11 is very hard , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the first and second interval , respectively , and close to the rayleigh - jeans value of 1 .",
    "for comparison , the median value of @xmath11 for long grbs in the gbm catalog is @xmath15 @xcite and synchrotron emission in the slow - cooling regime has @xmath16 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , this burst also has an unusually low @xmath10 ( @xmath17  kev in the first time interval ) , which is at the lowest 10th percentile of constrained @xmath18 for gbm bursts @xcite , and even more exceptional when considering the low redshift .",
    "motivated by these unusual spectral properties we attempt to fit the data with a bb model , which we find provides a good fit to the spectra .",
    "the fit to the first time interval is shown in fig",
    ".  [ spectrum ] and the best - fit parameters are presented in table [ fitparams ] . the temperature of the bb is seen to decrease between the two time intervals .    in order to test the hypothesis",
    "that the spectrum of this burst , which has rather poor signal - to - noise , could still be consistent with slow - cooling synchrotron emission we use xspec to simulate @xmath19 spectra with @xmath20 and @xmath12 and @xmath10 taken from the fit to the first interval .",
    "the simulations are based on the background spectrum , response files and exposure time of the real data , and uses poisson statistics to create synthetic spectra .",
    "fitting these spectra with a band function gives best - fit values of @xmath21 in only six cases , corresponding to a probability of @xmath22 of obtaining such a hard value of @xmath11 by chance .",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath20 can thus be rejected with very high confidence .    even for the case",
    "when the prompt emission is completely dominated by the jet photosphere the observed spectrum is not expected to be a pure planck function .",
    "geometric effects are expected to broaden the spectrum , with the hardest @xmath11 values of @xmath23 being obtained in the case of a wide jet viewed along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "in addition , we expect some broadening due to time - evolution of the spectrum during the @xmath24  s time intervals from which the spectra were extracted ( it is not possible to obtain good constraints on spectral parameters on a shorter time scale for this burst ) .",
    "a comparison of the band and bb fits can be used to constrain the amount of broadening in grb  101219b .",
    "while @xmath11 is close to the value expected for a pure bb , @xmath25 is harder than the exponential cutoff of a bb . in line with this ,",
    "a fit with a cutoff power - law model over - predicts the data at low energies as it needs to compensate for the somewhat harder high - energy slope .",
    "the flux derived from the bb fit to the first time interval is approximately @xmath26 of the flux derived from the band fit , which places an upper limit on the amount of broadening .",
    "as already mentioned , some of this will be accounted for by geometric effects and temporal evolution , but a small contribution from non - thermal emission , such as comptonization of the bb , is also possible .    for consistency",
    "we also analyzed the bat data of the burst .",
    "spectra were created using standard bat software ( heasoft 6.15 and batgrbproduct ) .",
    "the results of the joint spectral fits are fully consistent with those presented above .",
    "we note , however , that the bat spectra on their own are adequately fit with a simple power law ( @xmath27 in the first time interval ) .",
    "this is due to the combination of a weak signal and the limited band pass ( @xmath28  kev ) , which means that the power law simply provides an average of the spectrum covering the spectral peak .",
    "the radiative efficiency is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the isotropic energy emitted in gamma rays and @xmath31 is the kinetic energy of the jet .",
    "a measurement of @xmath32 is needed in order to calculate the absolute values of fireball parameters from the bb properties ( see section [ fireball ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath31 can be derived from x - ray afterglow observations , as described by @xcite .",
    "we obtained the x - ray afterglow light curve and spectra for from the xrt repository @xcite .",
    "fitting the count rate light curve using the method of @xcite yields three power - law segments with temporal decay indices of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 with two breaks at @xmath36  ks and @xmath37  ks .",
    "these segments can be identified as late prompt emission , a shallow phase with continuous energy injection and the normal decay due to the decelerating fireball .",
    "no jet break is detected .",
    "a flare around 300 - 600  s was modeled by a gaussian .",
    "the light curve and the fit are shown in fig .",
    "[ xrtlc ] .",
    "we estimate @xmath31 from the normal decay phase , assuming typical values for the fraction of energy in electrons and magnetic fields ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and neglecting inverse compton emission .",
    "we first determined the intrinsic column density , @xmath40 , by fitting the full spectrum during the normal decay ( i.e.  after 58  ks ) with a power law modified by intrinsic and galactic absorption ( with the galactic absorption fixed at @xmath41 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath42 , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "we then fit the model with @xmath40 fixed at this value to the spectrum at 58  ks and use the fit results together with equation ( 5 ) in @xcite to derive @xmath31 . assuming slow - cooling synchrotron emission with an electron spectral index @xmath43 ,",
    "the observed spectrum is consistent with being above the synchrotron cooling frequency .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath44  ergs . with @xmath45  ergs ( over @xmath7  kev in the rest frame of the burst )",
    "this corresponds to a relatively low efficiency of @xmath46 .",
    "this value of @xmath32 is associated with systematic uncertainties from our assumptions , in particular regarding the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "although the values of @xmath48 reported in the literature span many orders of magnitude , we note that our estimate of @xmath31 is only weakly dependent on this parameter . as an example , assuming a much lower value of @xmath49 ( the median value found by @xcite for @xmath50 and a constant density medium ) gives @xmath51 , i.e.  only slightly lower than our estimate above .",
    "the dependence on @xmath47 is stronger , but measurements of this parameter have a rather narrow distribution , with @xmath52 of grbs falling in the range @xmath53 @xcite , in line with theoretical simulations @xcite . increasing our value of @xmath47 to 0.3 at the high end of this distribution gives @xmath54 , which gives an estimate of the uncertainty from this parameter .",
    "a limit on a jet break can be obtained from the last time when such a break could be present without being detectable ( see @xcite ) . for this time",
    "is @xmath55  days .",
    "assuming an ambient number density of @xmath56 and @xmath32 and @xmath30 from above , this corresponds to a limit on the jet opening angle of @xmath57 and a collimation corrected energy @xmath58  ergs .",
    "the observed temperature and flux of the bb , together with @xmath32 and @xmath59 , can be used to calculate the properties of the outflow in the standard fireball scenario .",
    "following @xcite we calculate the lorentz factor ( @xmath60 ) , the radius where the fireball starts accelerating ( @xmath61 ) , the saturation radius ( @xmath62 , where the acceleration stops ) and the radius of the photosphere ( @xmath63 ) . in the calculations we assume that there is no dissipation below the photosphere and that @xmath60 is much larger than the inverse of the opening angle of the jet .",
    "the results for the two intervals are presented in table  [ partable ] .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in these results is the radiative efficiency , as already discussed above .",
    "another uncertainty is the contribution of non - thermal emission to the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "a very conservative limit on this can be obtained by comparing the fluxes from the band and bb fits , as described in section [ gammaobs ] .",
    "taking the difference of these fluxes to be non - thermal emission would reduce the values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 by about a factor of two , while at the same time increasing the values of @xmath63 and @xmath60 by about @xmath64 , as compared to the values presented in table  [ fitparams ] .",

    "as noted in section  [ intro ] there is growing evidence for photospheric emission in the prompt phase of grbs , but very few examples where the spectra are close to pure bbs .",
    "it is clear that special conditions are required in order to obtain such spectra .",
    "first , a fairly wide jet viewed close to the line of sight is needed in order to avoid significant geometric broadening .",
    "this is in line with the limit on the jet opening angle from section [ effic ] .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the low - energy slope of is harder than predicted for a spherically symmetric wind ( see section [ gammaobs ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the emission arises from a small patch within a clumpy jet , invalidating the assumption of a steady flow that is spherically symmetric inside @xmath79 .",
    "an additional requirement for having a narrow spectrum is the lack of significant dissipation of energy in the jet .",
    "the outflow parameters in table  [ fitparams ] provide important information about the jet .",
    "it is particularly interesting to relate the base of the jet to the size of the presumed compact remnant . in the first time interval @xmath80  cm , which corresponds to ten times the event horizon for a @xmath81 maximally spinning black hole ( or a @xmath82 non - spinning one ) .",
    "this mass range is close to the expected values for the generally assumed massive progenitor star , and suggests that the jet is launched from close to the black hole and then has an unobstructed path through the star .",
    "the latter requires a highly asymmetric explosion , in line with the observationally and theoretically well - established view that sn explosions are asymmetric .",
    "the only other grb for which absolute values of the outflow parameters have been calculated is the highly energetic grb  090902b , where @xcite found @xmath83  cm , i.e. significantly larger than for grb  101219b . that the conditions in this burst are different from is also clear from the fact that the spectral shape is broader , most likely indicating subphotospheric dissipation",
    ".      belongs to a small group of bursts in which a highly significant bb component has been detected in xrt data of the early afterglow @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite fit four time intervals between @xmath84 and @xmath85  s after the gbm trigger ( around the time of the flare in the light curve , see fig .",
    "[ xrtlc ] ) using a model comprising a power law and a bb , modified by absorption ( see their table 5 for the full fit results ) .",
    "the bb has an initial rest - frame temperature of @xmath86  kev and then decreases with time .    in order to investigate any possible connection between the bb in the prompt emission and the bb in the early afterglow we plot in fig .",
    "[ ktpars ] the evolution of the bb temperature as a function of time for the two datasets . the temporal evolution of the temperature in the xrt data is well described by a power law ( shown by the dashed line , with decay index @xmath87 ) , but the extrapolation of this fit to early times is clearly inconsistent with the gbm data .",
    "a broken power - law model also fails to connect the two data sets . in fig .",
    "[ ktpars ] we also plot the parameter @xmath88 , which is related to the effective transverse size of the photosphere .",
    "this parameter is also seen to evolve differently during the two phases .",
    "the lack of a smooth connection between the observed properties of the bb in the two data sets , together with the fact that the bb flux actually increases at late times @xcite , rules out the scenario that the late emission is due to high latitude emission from the jet after the central engine has died .",
    "we therefore explore the scenario that the late emission is due to late central engine activity , and calculate the outflow parameters from the low - energy bb as described in section [ fireball ] .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath60 and @xmath89 are shown in fig .",
    "[ ktpars ] for two scenarios : ( i ) all the late emission is prompt emission and ( ii ) the bb is the prompt emission from the jet , while the power - law component arises in a different region where the jet has started interacting with the circumstellar medium .",
    "the two scenarios produce comparable results .",
    "we see that at late times the jet has a low @xmath60 in the range @xmath90 . in order for such a slow jet to still produce a narrow bb spectrum the jet has to be very wide ( @xmath91 , consistent with the limit of @xmath92 from section [ effic ] ) or , alternatively",
    ", the emission could originate from a small patch within a clumpy jet .    as already discussed by @xcite ,",
    "there are also other possibilities for the origin of the low - energy bb .",
    "in particular , they find that emission from a cocoon surrounding the jet can explain the main features of the emission , while shock breakout from a sn is disfavored from the large inferred radius ( @xmath93  cm , much larger than the @xmath94  cm expected from the presumed wolf - rayet progenitor ) . while breakout through a thick wind could accommodate the large radius in the sn scenario , the spectrum is in this case expected to be flat in @xmath95 @xcite , contrary to what is observed for grb  101219b ."
