    "a typical nerve fiber is coated in myelin ( the myelin sheath consists of a single schwann cell which is wrapped about @xmath0 around the nerve fiber ) with spatially periodic gaps , the nodes of ranvier .",
    "roughly the myelin sheath increases the membrane resistance by a factor of about @xmath0 and decreases the membrane capacitance by a factor of about @xmath0 .",
    "typically , the width of the node of ranvier is about @xmath1 , the distance between nodes ( the length of myelin sheath ) is about @xmath2 that is close to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the nerve fiber diameter .",

    "diffusive coupling corresponds to axial currents between nodes and allows propagation of changes in the transmembrane potential ( action potential ) in the spatial variable .",
    "nerve fibers behave as intrinsic spatially discrete systems .",
    "the biological reason for such discrete structure : propagation of action potential along myelinated fibre is faster compare to that in nonmyelinated because of its saltatory propagation between nodes ( speed in a myelinated fibre is around@xmath5 and in a nonmyelinated fiber is @xmath6 ) . for further details of the model , physical parameters and equivalent electric circuit",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the idea that noise can play a positive role and benefit neural function is relatively new .",
    "just 60 years ago it was commonly accepted that the noise is destructive to neural encoding @xcite .",
    "today it is well established that noise plays constructive role in the nerve system @xcite .",
    "this new paradigm was initiated by research on stochastic resonance phenomena .",
    "it was shown that the stochastic resonance improves the transfer of information @xcite .    in this letter , we accomplish two goals .",
    "first , we propose and study the deterministic scheme for modelling of noise in a nerve fiber .",
    "this scheme involves dynamical fluctuations of electric characteristics of the membrane together with their negative feedback control depending on the noise intensity .",
    "then , to ensure ergodicity property of the dynamics , we combine this dynamical feedback control with a stochastic perturbation .",
    "in contrast to the random noise model ( see ) our scheme operates with the only white noise process that indirectly affect initial dynamics . while we do not claim that our scheme to model noise in a nerve fibre is better than standard additive stochastic current perturbation ( the langevin type equations ) , we state our approach as different .",
    "we consider a lattice of diffusively coupled nagumo cells described , in absence of noise , by the equations , @xmath7 is a spacial index , where @xmath8 has a bistable character , _ _ for example @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the standard @xmath13 point discretization of the laplacian ( discrete laplacian ) , and @xmath14 is a coefficient of the diffusive coupling . in addition",
    "we define `` potential '' @xmath15 by the differential equation , @xmath16 . in these equations variable @xmath17 corresponds to a transmembrane electric potential , @xmath18 corresponds to the membrane conductance , @xmath19 is the threshold potential . besides modelling of the action potential propagation along a nerve fibre ,",
    "this lattice system is important in another different areas of research @xcite .    in cases where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is bounded",
    ", we consider this set with respect to boundary conditions , for example of the neumann type . for",

    "hereafter we accept short notations : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and so on . with these definitions ,",

    "we accept the following conditions , @xmath33",
    "to model the influence of noise on deterministic system ( [ eq : n ] ) , it is widely accepted in the literature that the noise is implemented in ( [ eq : n ] ) by the additive stochastic currents , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the set of independent standard generalized gaussian @xmath36-correlated processes completely characterized by the first two cumulants , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; @xmath39 means averaging over all realizations of the random perturbations .",

    "this is an important relation that connects the noise intensity to configurational ensemble averages and thus can be considered as the definition of the noise intensity . in what follows",

    "namely , in the case of a cubic nonlinearity of @xmath65 , the general form of @xmath15 is double - well .",
