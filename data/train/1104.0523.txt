    "the study of the gaugino sector of supersymmetry is a complex and important endeavour , which appears well suited to a linear collider of sufficient energy and luminosity .",
    "the main observables of interest are the masses of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states and their production cross sections , including those with polarised beams .",
    "@xmath3 collisions offer two independent techniques for determining the mass of supersymmetric particles .",
    "these are the analysis of the energy spectrum of the sm particle produced in association with a lighter supersymmetric state in the two - body decays and the study of the pair production cross section near threshold .",
    "these techniques have already been extensively studied for lower centre - of - mass energies , @xmath4 , between 0.35 to 0.5  tev  @xcite . in this note , we analyse the gaugino pair production and derive the statistical accuracy on their masses using both techniques and including the effects of initial state radiation ( isr ) , beamstrahlung ( bs ) and parton energy resolution for multi - tev @xmath3 collisions .",
    "we follow the evolution of these accuracies for fully hadronic final states from pure signal samples to realistic inclusive susy samples and validate the results obtained at generator level with analyses performed on fully simulated and reconstructed events .",
    "the study provides us with requirements on parton energy resolution which are complementary to those obtained from other processes , such as heavy susy higgs decays , since the kinematics of decays of gaugino pairs with large missing energy into pairs of escaping neutralinos does not benefit from the kinematic fits , which are instead applicable to processes where the full beam energy is deposited in the detector .",
    "the estimated mass accuracies can be compared in a next step to those required for the reconstruction of the gut scale susy parameters  @xcite and the determination of the lightest neutralino contribution to the dark matter relic density in the universe  @xcite .",
    "this comparison will provide us with well - motivated quantitative requirements on parton energy resolution in susy events .",
    "this study considers two scenarios in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) model , which offer different experimental challenges .",
    "their parameters are given in table  [ tab : modelpar ] .",
    "the first ( model i ) , adopted as a benchmark point for the clic cdr studies  @xcite , has the lightest neutralino at 340  gev and the chargino and heavier neutralinos with masses in the range 640 to 917  gev ( see table  [ tab : mass ] and the left panel of figure[fig : spectra ] ) . at @xmath4",
    "= 3  tev all the gauginos are observables .",
    "the relatively low masses and the 3  tev centre - of - mass energy make cross sections sizable but the beamstrahlung effects more significant ( see table  [ tab : modelpar ] ) . in the second ( model ii  )",
    "the lightest neutralino has a mass of 554  gev , while the other neutralinos and the charginos have masses in the range from 1064 to 1414  gev ( see table  [ tab : mass ] and the right panel of figure[fig : spectra ] )  @xcite . at 3  tev ,",
    "most gauginos are close to threshold for pair production and cross sections are small .",
    "this minimises the beamstrahlung effects , since the production cross section drops significantly when the beams lose energy due to radiation .",
    "the cross sections are given in table  [ tab : xsec ] and figure  [ fig : xsec ] .",
    ".parameters of the two cmssm models adopted in this study [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : scan ]    we compute the cross section @xmath5 at various @xmath4 values for a set of closely spaced masses and obtain the derivative @xmath6 of the change of the cross section at each energy per unit of mass change .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig : sens ] , which indicate that the maximum of the sensitivity to the mass is achieved near threshold . the number of scan points and the share of the statistics among them is optimised by studying the mass uncertainty obtained from the fit for different assumptions .",
    "we find that it is preferable to concentrate the luminosity in a small number of scan points .",
    "for example , the statistical accuracy on the mass of the @xmath7 in the model  i varies from @xmath80.85  gev , obtained for a four - point scan ( 1310@xmath91950  gev ) , to @xmath80.45  gev , when the luminosity is split between just two points , one of which at the peak of the sensitivity ( @xmath4=1350  gev ) and the second close to threshold ( @xmath4=1310  gev ) .",
    "this confirms the findings of  @xcite for lower sparticle masses and different luminosity spectrum .",
    "finally , we consider the option of operating the collider with polarised beams .",
    "results are summarised in table  [ tab : scan ] . in all cases , except the @xmath10 , the mass accuracies obtained with a dedicated threshold scan improve on those resulting from the kinematic edge analysis at 3  tev by factors of 2 or more .",
    "the use of polarised beam further improves these accuracies , effectively compensating for the loss of sensitivity due to isr and bs .",
    "the determination of chargino and neutralino masses in high - mass susy scenarios with two - body decays into @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons provides us with a mean to quantify the effect of radiation , by isr and beamstrahlung , and parton energy resolution on the accuracy achievable in supersymmetric particle mass measurements at a multi - tev @xmath3 linear collider . in our analysis",
    "both fits to boson energy spectra and threshold scans are considered for fully hadronic final states .",
    "results from generator - level quantities are validated using fully simulated and reconstructed events in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 final states .",
    "not accounting for reconstruction efficiencies , estimated to be @xmath1660% in four jet final states , the mass of charginos and neutralinos can be determined from the kinematic edges of the boson energy in inclusive susy event samples to a relative accuracy in the range 0.3% to 1.0% ( 0.6% - 1.0% ) in absence of radiation and energy resolution effects to 0.8% to 1.7% ( 1.1% - 2.0% ) accounting for isr , bs and realistic energy resolution for the benchmark with particle masses in the range 600 - 900  gev ( @xmath171000  gev ) , respectively , with 2  ab@xmath18 of integrated luminosity at @xmath4 = 3  tev .",
    "the relative increase of the statistical uncertainty of the mass measurement is larger for the model  i which has the sparticles masses far way from pair the production thresholds .",
    "however , in absolute terms the larger production cross sections in this model yield better statistical accuracy in the mass determination . by adopting the criterion that the degradation to the mass measurement statistical accuracy from the parton energy resolution should not exceed that induced by isr and bs",
    ", we derive the requirement of a relative energy resolution for jets , @xmath190.05 .",
    "if the accelerator can operate at energies below the nominal @xmath4 ( down to @xmath4=1310  gev for model  i and @xmath4=2200  gev for model  ii ) with comparable performance to collect about one third of the statistics at centre - of - mass energies close to the kinematic thresholds for sparticle pair production , the mass accuracies from these threshold scans improves by factors of 2 or more compared to those obtained from study of the kinematic edges at the maximum @xmath4 energy .",
    "the availability of polarised beam in the scan further improves these accuracies , effectively compensating for the loss of sensitivity due to the effect of isr and beamstrahlung .",
