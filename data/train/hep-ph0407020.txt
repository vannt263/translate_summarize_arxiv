    "the literature abounds in reviews of experimental techniques for detection of cosmic ray air showers  @xcite , as well as overviews of the physics of cosmic ray propagation and possible astrophysical and exotic origins  @xcite .",
    "this review follows a somewhat different path , focusing exclusively on cosmic ray phenomenology from the top of the atmosphere to the earth s surface .",
    "the topics covered are viewed from the perspective of particle physics , and the reader is assumed only to possess a basic background in this field .",
    "we hope this article can provide a sort of bridge for high energy physicists interested in exploring some of the challenges facing upcoming ground- and space  based cosmic ray observatories .      for primary energy @xmath5  gev",
    "the observed cosmic ray flux can be described by a series of power laws with the flux falling about three orders of magnitude for each decade increase in energy . in the decade centered at",

    "the spectrum steepens further to @xmath9 above @xmath10 and then flattens to @xmath7 at @xmath11 forming a feature known as `` the ankle ''  @xcite . within the statistical uncertainty of existing data , which is large for @xmath12  gev ,",
    "the tail of the spectrum is consistent with a simple extrapolation at that slope to the highest energies . thus far , for earth - based accelerators , the record holder for collisions with the highest energy per nucleon is the tevatron , which countercirculates protons and antiprotons with @xmath13  tev .",
    "this center - of - mass energy corresponds closely to that at the knee .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , now under construction at cern , will collide protons with protons at @xmath14  tev .",
    "this impressive energy is still about a factor of 50 smaller than the center - of - mass energy of the highest energy cosmic ray so far observed , assuming @xmath15 .    for primary cosmic ray energies above @xmath16",
    "gev , the flux becomes so low that direct detection of the primary using devices in or above the upper atmosphere is , for all practical purposes , impossible .",
    "fortunately , in such cases the primary particle has enough energy to initiate a particle cascade in the atmosphere large enough that the products are detectable at ground .",
    "there are several techniques which can be employed in detecting these extensive air showers ( eas ) , ranging from sampling of particles in the cascade to measurements of fluorescence , erenkov or radio emissions produced by the shower .",
    "the most commonly used detection method involves sampling the shower front at a given altitude using an array of sensors spread over a large area .",
    "sensors , such as plastic scintillators or erenkov detectors are used to infer the particle density and the relative arrival times of the shower front at different locations ; from this , one can estimate the energy and direction of the primary cosmic ray .",
    "the spacing between stations determines the energy threshold for a vertical shower .",
    "the muon content is usually sought either by exploiting the signal timing in the surface sensors or by employing dedicated detectors which are shielded from the electromagnetic shower component .",
    "inferring the primary energy from energy deposits at the ground is not completely straightforward , and involves proper modeling of both the detector response and the physics of the first few cascade generations .",
    "this second point is particularly subtle and will be the main subject of sec .",
    "[ hadronic ] .",
    "another highly successful air shower detection method involves measurement of the longitudinal development of the cascade by sensing the fluorescence light produced via interactions of the charged particles in the atmosphere .",
    "as an extensive air shower develops , it dissipates much of its energy by exciting and ionizing air molecules along its path .",
    "excited nitrogen molecules fluoresce producing radiation in the 300 - 400 nm ultraviolet range , to which the atmosphere is quite transparent . under favorable atmospheric conditions eas",
    "can be detected at distances as large as 20  km , about 2 attenuation lengths in a standard desert atmosphere at ground level , though observations can only be made on clear moonless nights , yielding a duty cycle of about 10% .",
    "the shower development appears as a rapidly moving spot of light whose angular motion depends on both the distance and the orientation of the shower axis .",
    "the integrated light signal is proportional to the total energy deposited in the atmosphere .",
    "systematic errors can arise from a variety of sources , including uncertainties in the nitrogen fluorescence induced by the particle beam  @xcite , as well as uncertainties in the atmospheric conditions at the time the fluorescence measurements are taken  @xcite .",
    "the first measurements of ultra high energy cosmic rays were carried out by linsley at volcano ranch ( @xmath17n , @xmath18w ) in the late 1950 s  @xcite using an array of scintillation counters .",
    "more recent experiments using surface detection techniques include haverah park in england ( @xmath19n , @xmath20w )  @xcite , yakutsk in russia ( @xmath21n , @xmath22e )  @xcite , the sydney university giant airshower recorder ( sugar ) in australia ( @xmath23s , @xmath24e )  @xcite , and the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) , about 100  km west of tokyo ( @xmath25n , @xmath26e )  @xcite .",

    "[ t ]    in recent years , a somewhat confused picture _ vis    vis _ the energy spectrum and arrival direction distribution has been emerging . since 1998 , the agasa collaboration has consistently reported  @xcite a continuation of the spectrum beyond the expected greisen ",
    "zatsepin  kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite , which should arise at about @xmath38  gev if cosmic ray sources are at cosmological distances .",
    "this theoretical feature of the spectrum is mainly a consequence of interactions of the primary cosmic ray with the microwave background radiation .",
    "in contrast , the most recent results from hires  @xcite describe a spectrum which is consistent with the expected gzk feature .",
    "the discrepancy between the 2 estimated fluxes is shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "several analyses were done in trying to understand this difference . in particular , since the quoted systematic errors in the energy estimate are in the neighbourhood of 30% , it was argued  @xcite that if the agasa collaboration overestimates their energies by 30% and the hires collaboration underestimates them by about the same amount , then the two spectra can be brought into reasonable agreement within statistical errors .",
    "although there seems to be a remarkable agreement among experiments on predictions about isotropy on large scale structure  @xcite , this is certainly not the case when considering the two - point correlation function on a small angular scale .",
    "the agasa collaboration reports observations of event clusters which have a chance probability smaller than 1% to arise from a random distribution  @xcite .",
    "far from confirming the agasa results , the recent analysis reported by the hires collaboration showed that their data are consistent with no clustering among the highest energy events  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of such clusters would be a tremendous breakthrough for the field , but the case for them is not yet proved .",
    "special care must be taken when computing the statistical significance in such an analysis .",
    "in particular , it is important to define the search procedure _ a priori _ in order to ensure one does not inadvertently perform `` trials '' by studying the data before deciding upon the cuts .",
    "very recently , with the aim of avoiding accidental bias on the number of trials performed in selecting the angular bin , the original claim of the agasa collaboration  @xcite was re - examined considering only those events observed after the original claim  @xcite .",
    "this study showed that the evidence for clustering in the agasa data set is weaker than was previously supposed , and is consistent with the hypothesis of isotropically distributed arrival directions .",
    "the confusing experimental situation regarding the gzk feature and the small - scale clustering in the distribution of arrival direction should be resolved in the near future by the pao , which will provide not only a data set of unprecedented size , but also the machinery for controlling some of the more problematic systematic uncertainties . as we will discuss in this review , however ,",
    "the task of identifying primary species is more challenging .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ hadronic ] , we describe the phenomenology of hadronic interactions with the goal of providing an overview of the main systematic uncertainties hindering the determination of the primary energy from observations at the ground . in the following section , we discuss the electromagnetic processes responsible for generating the great majority of particles in the shower .",
    "armed with these two principal shower ingredients , we then discuss observables that are accessible to experiment .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ discrimination ] , we describe how these observables are used to infer the primary composition . in sec .",
    "[ nus ] we summarize properties of neutrino interactions and discuss observables in the deeply penetrating showers they produce .",
    "since the expected rate of such events is very low , any enhancement of the cross section due to physics beyond the electroweak scale should be evident in this channel . at the end",
    "we allow ourselves to venture into speculative territory and discuss the experimental signatures of neutrino interactions in scenarios with tev - scale gravity . before getting underway ,",
    "we first briefly summarize the main features of the atmospheric `` calorimeter . ''      unlike man - made calorimeters , the atmosphere is a calorimeter whose properties vary in a predictable way with altitude , and in a relatively unpredictable way with time . beginning with the easier of the two variations ,",
    "we note that the density and pressure depend strongly on the height , while the temperature does not change by more than about 30% over the range 0100  km above sea level .",
    "therefore we can get a reasonable impression of the density variation by assuming an isothermal atmosphere , in which case the density @xmath39 , where @xmath40  kg / m@xmath36 and @xmath41  km is known as the scale - height of the atmosphere , @xmath42 being the ideal gas constant , @xmath43 the average molecular weight of air , @xmath44 the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath45  k. of course , reading out such a natural calorimeter is complicated by the effects of varying aerosol and molecular attenuation and scattering .    the quantity that most intuitively describes the varying density of the atmospheric medium is the vertical atmospheric depth , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the height . however , the quantity most relevant in air shower simulations is the slant depth , @xmath48 , which defines the actual amount of air traversed by the shower .",
    "the variation of the slant depth with zenith angle is shown in fig .",

    "the atmospheric medium is endowed with a magnetic field . in general , the geomagnetic field is described by 3 parameters , its strength @xmath52 its inclination @xmath53 and its declination @xmath54 .",
    "the inclination is defined as the angle between the local horizontal plane and the @xmath55-field .",
    "the declination is defined as the angle between the horizontal component of the field @xmath56 ( i.e. , perpendicular to the arrival direction of the air shower ) and the geographical north ( direction of the local meridian ) .",
    "the angle @xmath57 is positive when @xmath55 points downward and @xmath54 is positive when @xmath56 is inclined towards the east .",
    "uncertainties in hadronic interactions at ultra high energies constitute one of the most problematic sources of systematic error in analysis of air showers .",
    "this section will explain the two principal schools of thought for extrapolating collider data to ultra high energies .",
    "we start with a general description of @xmath58 collisions within the eikonal model .",
    "next , we consider the specific case of hadronic interactions in the atmosphere , and discuss the most widely used monte carlo codes .",
    "finally , we study the potential of present and future accelerators to produce data valuable for understanding extensive air shower physics .",
    "particular emphasis is placed on measurements of interaction processes at extreme forward directions and the cross sections for diffractive interactions .",
    "soft multiparticle production with small transverse momenta with respect to the collision axis is a dominant feature of most hadronic events at center - of - mass energies @xmath60 ( see _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) . despite the fact that strict calculations based on ordinary qcd perturbation theory are not feasible , there are some phenomenological models that successfully take into account the main properties of the soft diffractive processes .",
    "these models , inspired by @xmath61 qcd expansion are also supplemented with generally accepted theoretical principles like duality , unitarity , regge behavior , and parton structure .",
    "the interactions are no longer described by single particle exchange , but by highly complicated modes known as reggeons .",
    "up to about 50  gev , the slow growth of the cross section with @xmath62 is driven by a dominant contribution of a special reggeon , the pomeron .    at higher energies , semihard interactions arising from the hard scattering of partons that carry only a very small fraction of the momenta of their parent hadrons",
    "can compete successfully with soft processes  @xcite .",

    "however , it is easily seen using geometrical arguments that the rapid growth of the gluon density at low @xmath84 would eventually require corrections to the evolution equations  @xcite .    the high energy minijet cross section is then determined by the small-@xmath84 behavior of the parton distributions or , rather , by that of the dominant gluon distribution ( via the lower limits of the @xmath66 , @xmath67 integrations ) @xmath108 a nave estimate of the @xmath109 behavior at high energies can be obtained via extrapolation of @xmath110 to small @xmath84 in eq .",

    "the evolution of an extensive air shower is dominated by electromagnetic processes .",
    "the interaction of a baryonic cosmic ray with an air nucleus high in the atmosphere leads to a cascade of secondary mesons and nucleons .",

    "the density of atmospheric target nucleons is @xmath207  @xmath208 and so even for relatively low energies , say @xmath209  tev , the probability of decay before interaction falls below 10% .",
    "ultimately , the electromagnetic cascade dissipates around 90% of the primary particle s energy , and hence the total number of electromagnetic particles is very nearly proportional to the shower energy  @xcite .    by the time",

    "it is worth mentioning that these figures dramatically change for the case of very inclined showers . for a primary zenith angle ,",
    "@xmath213 the electromagnetic component becomes attenuated exponentially with atmospheric depth , being almost completely absorbed at ground level .",
    "we remind the reader that the vertical atmosphere is @xmath214 g/@xmath215 , and is about 36 times deeper for completely horizontal showers ( see fig .  [ slantdepth ] ) . as a result ,",
    "most of the energy at ground level from an inclined shower is carried by muons .",
    "in contrast to hadronic collisions , the electromagnetic interactions of shower particles can be calculated very accurately from quantum electrodynamics .",
    "electromagnetic interactions are thus not a major source of systematic errors in shower simulations .",
    "the first comprehensive treatment of electromagnetic showers was elaborated by rossi and greissen  @xcite .",
    "this treatment was recently cast in a more pedagogical form by gaisser  @xcite , which we summarize in the subsequent paragraphs .",
    "the generation of the electromagnetic component is driven by electron bremsstrahlung and pair production  @xcite .",
    "eventually the average energy per particle drops below a critical energy , @xmath216 , at which point ionization takes over from bremsstrahlung and pair production as the dominant energy loss mechanism .",
    "the @xmath90 energy loss rate due to bremsstrahlung radiation is nearly proportional to their energy , whereas the ionization loss rate varies only logarithmically with the @xmath90 energy .",
    "though several different definitions of the critical energy appear in the literature  @xcite , throughout this review we take the critical energy to be that at which the ionization loss per radiation lenght is equal to the electron energy , yielding @xmath217  86  mev  @xcite .",

    "the changeover from radiation losses to ionization losses depopulates the shower .",
    "one can thus categorize the shower development in three phases : the growth phase , in which all the particles have energy @xmath221 ; the shower maximum , @xmath222 ; and the shower tail , where the particles only lose energy , get absorbed or decay .",
    "the relevant quantities participating in the development of the electromagnetic cascade are the probability for an electron of energy @xmath223 to radiate a photon of energy @xmath224 and the probability for a photon to produce a pair @xmath225 in which one of the particles ( hereafter @xmath226 ) has energy @xmath227 .",
    "these probabilities are determined by the properties of the air and the cross sections of the two processes .    in the energy range of interest ,",
    "the impact parameter of the electron or photon is larger than an atomic radius , so the nuclear field is screened by its electron cloud . in the case of complete screening ,",
    "where the momentum transfer is small , the cross section for bremsstrahlung can be approximated by  @xcite @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the effective mass number of the air , @xmath230 is a constant , and @xmath231 is avogadro s number . in the infrared limit ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath232 ) this approximation is inaccurate at the level of about 2.5% , which is small compared to typical experimental errors associated with cosmic air shower detectors .",
    "of course , the approximation fails as @xmath233 , when nuclear screening becomes incomplete , and as @xmath234 , at which point the lpm and dielectric suppression effects become important , as we discuss below .    using similar approximations , the cross section for pair production",
    "can be written as  @xcite @xmath235 the similarities between this expression and eq .",

    "( [ p_pp ] ) , @xmath241 as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ p_b ] ) , the total probability for bremsstrahlung radiation is logarithmically divergent .",
    "however , this infrared divergence is eliminated by the interference of bremsstrahlung amplitudes from multiple scattering centers .",
    "this collective effect of the electric potential of several atoms is known as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect  @xcite . of course , the lpm suppression of the cross section results in an effective increase of the mean free path of electrons and photons .",
    "this effectively retards the development of the electromagnetic component of the shower .",
    "it is natural to introduce an energy scale , @xmath242 , at which the inelasticity is low enough that the lpm effect becomes significant  @xcite . below @xmath242 ,",
    "the energy loss rate due to bremsstrahlung is roughly @xmath243    with this in mind , we now identify the constant @xmath244  g cm@xmath133 with the radiation length in air , defined as the mean distance over which a high - energy electron loses @xmath245 of its energy , or equivalently @xmath246 of the mean free path for pair production by a high - energy photon  @xcite .    the experimental confirmation of the lpm effect at stanford linear accelerator center ( slac )",
    "@xcite has motivated new analyses of its consequences in cosmic ray physics  @xcite .",
    "the most evident signatures of the lpm effect on shower development are a shift in the position of the shower maximum @xmath222 and larger fluctuations in the shower development .",
    "[ t ]    when considering the lpm effect in the development of air showers produced by ultra high energy cosmic rays , one has to keep in mind that the suppression in the cross sections is strongly dependent on the atmospheric depth .",
    "since the upper atmosphere is very thin the lpm effect becomes noticeable only for photons and electrons with energies above @xmath247  gev . for baryonic primaries the lpm effect",
    "does not become important until the primary energy exceeds @xmath248gev .",
    "this is because the electromagnetic shower does not commence until after a significant fraction of the primary energy has been dissipated through hadronic interactions . to give a visual impression of how the lpm effect slows down the initial growth of high energy photon - induced showers ,",
    "we show the average longitudinal shower development of @xmath33  gev proton and @xmath211-ray showers ( generated using aires 2.6.0  @xcite ) with and without the lpm effect in fig .",
    "[ lpm ] .    at energies at which the lpm effect is important ( _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath249 ) , @xmath211-ray showers will have already commenced in the geomagnetic field at almost all latitudes .",
    "this reduces the energies of the primaries that reach the atmosphere , and thereby compensates the tendency of the lpm effect to retard the shower development . the first description of photon interactions in the geomagnetic field dates back at least as far as 1966  @xcite , with a punctuated revival of activity in the early 1980 s  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a rekindling of interest in the topic has led to refined calculations  @xcite .",
    "primary photons with energies above @xmath33  gev convert into @xmath250 pairs , which in turn emit synchrotron photons .",
    "regardless of the primary energy , the spectrum of the resulting photon `` preshower '' entering the upper atmosphere extends over several decades below the primary photon energy , and is peaked at energies below @xmath33  gev  @xcite .",
    "the geomagnetic cooling thus switches on at about the same energy at which the lpm effect does , and thereby preempts the lpm - related observables which would otherwise be evident .",
    "recent simulations  @xcite which include photon preshowering indicate that above @xmath251  gev this effect tends to accelerate the shower development , shifting the @xmath222 to a smaller value than previous calculation suggested  @xcite , and into a range consistent with @xmath222 typical of a proton primary .",
    "[ t ]    the relevant parameter to determine both conversion probability and synchrotron emission is @xmath252 , where @xmath223 is the @xmath211-ray energy and @xmath253 the transverse magnetic field .",
    "this leads to a large directional and geographical dependence of shower observables .",
    "thus , each experiment has its own preferred direction for identifying primary gamma rays .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ map ] shows a map of the photon conversion probability in the geomagnetic field for all incident directions evaluated at the location of the hires experiment ( @xmath254  g , @xmath255 and @xmath256 )  @xcite .",

    "note that this conversion - free region shrinks rapidly with increasing primary energy .",
    "a similar evaluation for the southern site of the pierre auger observatory ( @xmath257  g , @xmath258 , and @xmath259 ) can be found in  @xcite .",
    "most of the general features of an electromagnetic cascade can be understood in terms of the toy model due to heitler  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the shower is imagined to develop exclusively via bremsstrahlung and pair production , each of which results in the conversion of one particle into two .",
    "as was previously discussed , these physical processes are characterized by an interaction length @xmath230 .",
    "one can thus imagine the shower as a particle tree with branches that bifurcate every @xmath230 , until they fall below a critical energy , @xmath216 , at which point energy loss processes dominate .",
    "up to @xmath216 , the number of particles grows geometrically , so that after @xmath260 branchings , the total number of particles in the shower is @xmath261 . at the depth of shower maximum @xmath222 ,",
    "all particles are at the critical energy , @xmath216 , and the energy of the primary particle , @xmath262 , is split among all the @xmath263 particles . putting this together , we get : @xmath264 in real life , the combination of the lpm and geomagnetic effects introduces large fluctuations in the value of @xmath222 for photon showers .",
    "the prediction of this toy model roughly lies within the range of these fluctuations .",
    "even baryon - induced showers are dominated by electromagnetic processes , so this toy model is still enlightening for such cases . in particular , for proton showers , eq .",
    "( [ heitler ] ) tells us that the @xmath222 scales logarithmically with primary energy , while @xmath265 scales linearly .",
    "moreover , to extend this discussion to heavy nuclei , we can apply the superposition principle as a reasonable first approximation . in this approximation , we pretend that the nucleus comprises unbound nucleons , such that the point of first interaction of one nucleon is independent of all the others .",

    "while the heitler model is very useful for imparting a first intuition regarding global shower properties , the details of shower evolution are far too complex to be fully described by a simple analytical model .",
    "full monte carlo simulation of interaction and transport of each individual particle is required for precise modeling of the shower development . at present two",

    "asymmetry is introduced because of both unequal attenuation of the electromagnetic components arriving at the ground earlier than and later than the core  @xcite , and geometrical effects which also reduce the early compared to the late flux  @xcite .",
    "moreover , deflections on the geomagnetic field become important for showers inclined by more than about @xmath286    in the framework of cascade theory , any effect coming from the influence of the atmosphere should be accounted as a function of the slant depth @xmath280  @xcite .",

    "second , the muon has a much smaller cross section for radiation and pair production than the electron , and so the muonic component of eas develops differently than does the electromagnetic component .",
    "the smaller multiple scattering suffered by muons leads to earlier arrival times at the ground for muons than for the electromagnetic component .",
    "the ratio of electrons to muons depends strongly on the distance from the core ; for example , the @xmath212 to @xmath298 ratio for a @xmath210  gev vertical proton shower varies from 17 to 1 at 200  m from the core to 1 to 1 at 2000  m. the ratio between the electromagnetic and muonic shower components behaves somewhat differently in the case of inclined showers . for zenith angles greater than @xmath299 , the @xmath212/@xmath298 ratio remains roughly constant at a given distance from the core .",
    "as the zenith angle grows beyond @xmath34 , this ratio decreases , until at @xmath300 , it is 400 times smaller than for a vertical shower .",
    "another difference between inclined and vertical showers is that the average muon energy at ground changes dramatically . for horizontal showers , the lower",
    "energy muons are filtered out by a combination of energy loss mechanisms and the finite muon lifetime : for vertical showers , the average muon energy is 1  gev , while for horizontal showers it is about 2 orders of magnitude greater .",
    "the muon densities obtained in shower simulations using sibyll 2.1 fall more rapidly with lateral distance to the shower core than those obtained using qgsjet 01 . this can be understood as a manifestation of the enhanced leading particle effect in sibyll , which can be traced to the relative hardness of the electromagnetic form factor profile function .",
    "the curvature of the distribution @xmath301 is measurably different in the two cases , and , with sufficient statistics , could possibly serve as a discriminator between hadronic interaction models , provided the primary species can be determined from some independent observable(s )  @xcite .",
    "high energy muons lose energy through @xmath250 pair production , muon - nucleus interaction , bremsstrahlung , and knock - on electron ( @xmath54-ray ) production  @xcite .",
    "the first three processes are discrete in the sense that they are characterized by high inelasticity and a large mean free path . on the other hand , because of its short mean free path and its small inelasticity , knock - on electron production can be considered a continuous process .",
    "the muon bremsstrahlung cross section is suppressed by a factor of @xmath302 with respect to electron bremsstrahlung , see eq .",
    "( [ brem ] ) .",
    "since the radiation length for air is about @xmath303 , and the vertical atmospheric depth is 1000  g / cm@xmath32 , muon bremsstrahlung is of negligible importance for vertical air shower development .",
    "energy loss due to muon - nucleus interactions is somewhat smaller than muon bremsstrahlung . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sergio ] , energy loss by pair production is slightly more important than bremsstrahlung at about 1  gev , and becomes increasingly dominant with energy . finally , knock - on electrons have a very small mean free path ( see fig .",
    "[ sergio ] ) , but also a very small inelasticity , so that this contribution to the energy loss is comparable to that from the hard processes .",
    "[ t ]    in addition to muon production through charged pion decay , photons can directly generate muon pairs , or produce hadron pairs which in turn decay to muons . in the case of direct pair production",
    ", the large muon mass leads to a higher threshold for this process than for electron pair production .",
    "furthermore , qed predicts that @xmath305 production is suppressed by a factor @xmath306 compared the bethe - heitler cross section .",
    "the cross section for hadron production by photons is much less certain , since it involves the _ hadronic structure _ of the photon .",
    "this has been measured at hera for photon energies corresponding to @xmath307  gev  @xcite .",
    "this energy is still well below the energies of the highest energy cosmic rays , but nonetheless , these data do constrain the extrapolation of the cross sections to high energies . to give an idea of the rates , at 100  gev the cross section for @xmath308 is @xmath309  650  mb , _",
    "i.e. _ much larger than the cross sections for hadronic interaction ( @xmath309 1.4 mb ) or for muon pair production ( @xmath309 0.015 mb ) .",
    "now we consider the lateral distribution of the muon component of an extensive air shower . unlike the electrons and photons , muons are relatively unaffected by multiple coulomb scattering , and so their lateral distribution function ( ldf ) retains some information about the parent pion trajectories . in",
    "what follows , we first discuss a parameterization characterizing the muon ldf which is motivated only by the muon genealogy .",
    "after that , we add to the discussion the effect of the geomagnetic field on the evolution of the lateral distribution .",
    "one of the earliest parameterizations of the muon ldf in vertical showers was empirically derived by greisen  @xcite .",
    "this ldf was inspired by the nkg parametrization , and is factorized into two terms , @xmath310 where @xmath311 gives the normalization as a function of depth @xmath280 , @xmath312 is a structure function describing the lateral shape of the shower , and @xmath313  m is analogous to the molire radius .",
    "later , vernov and collaborators proposed a semi - analytical form of the structure function  @xcite , @xmath314 with @xmath315 and @xmath316  m. similar approaches were also suggested by hillas group at the university of leeds  @xcite and by the sugar collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the slopes from eqs .",
    "( [ sf1 ] ) and ( [ sf2 ] ) are in very good agreement with each other at intermediate distance , but eq .  ( [ sf2 ] ) predicts a distribution which is flatter close to the shower core and more strongly damped at large distances .",
    "these ldfs have been used to fit experimental data .",
    "however , neither function reproduces the whole radial range of an extensive air shower .",
    "this is a consequence of neglecting the shower age in formulating the structure functions .",
    "very recently , the kascade collaboration has used an nkg formula to fit muon density distributions  @xcite .",
    "the fits were performed close to the shower core ( @xmath317  m ) with non - conventional values of @xmath318 and age parameter , @xmath319 .",
    "one expects there to be a dependence of the ldf parameters on the shower age .",
    "however , in contrast to electrons , muons in an air shower are less attenuated and little affected by coulomb scattering , so the dependence of the ldf on the shower age is not the same as that exhibited by the electromagnetic component .",
    "the lateral growth of the shower is largely determined by the direction of emission of the parent particle and hence increases while the shower propagates downward .",
    "two approaches for including shower age - dependence in the muon structure function have been discussed in the literature  @xcite . here , we consider the more recent treatment , in which a vernov - like approach is used taking a slope dependence on atmospheric depth , @xmath320 with @xmath319 as given in eq .",
    "( [ age2 ] ) .",
    "it is easily seen  @xcite that , if the parent particles are created with a @xmath321 distribution , @xmath322 , then the vernov distribution at ground level has a value of @xmath323 given by @xmath324 where @xmath325 is the mean transverse momentum , @xmath326 the mean energy of muons and @xmath327 the mean height of muon production .",
    "these approximate expressions can serve to calculate the variation with depth of the parameters characterizing the lateral spread .",
    "the ratio @xmath328 can be considered constant while the shower develops  @xcite and the variation of @xmath323 with altitude is determined only by the dependence of @xmath327 on depth , @xmath280 .",
    "muons are produced in every pion generation and their energy distribution follows that of their parents .",
    "there are three phenomena contributing to the behavior of @xmath327 as a function of @xmath280 .",
    "the first is simply the dependence of the atmospheric density on height and temperature . for an isothermal atmosphere of scale @xmath329 one",
    "obtains @xmath330 .",
    "the second phenomenon is the `` pionization '' process : the competition between pion production and decay .",
    "the last contribution to the behavior of @xmath327 is associated with systematics induced by hadronic interaction models . in",
    "what follows , we leave aside the issue of systematic errors and as an example adopt qgsjet 98 as the hadronic interaction model .",

    "fits to the vernov - like distribution are overlaid on the simulation results , indicating validity of the parametrization  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the total number of muons @xmath335 from the fits agrees quite well with the corresponding values predicted by the monte carlo simulation , even though the fits are performed at core distances @xmath336",
    "m.    muons can travel long distances without interacting with the medium , and consequently the ground density profiles are significantly modified by the earth s magnetic field .",
    "the global shower observables , like longitudinal and lateral distributions , are not affected by the geomagnetic field for zenith angles @xmath287  @xcite . however , for the case of very inclined showers , which are dominated by muons , the density at ground is rendered quite asymmetric by the geomagnetic field . in the remainder of this section",
    "we describe these effects quantitatively  @xcite .",
    "consider a highly relativistic muon of energy @xmath337 and transverse momentum @xmath321 that travels a distance @xmath338 to reach ground .",
    "this muon suffers a deviation @xmath275 from the shower axis given by @xmath339 now , it is easily seen that if the energy spectrum of muons is taken as @xmath340 , the muon density is given by  @xcite @xmath341    to take into account the effect of the geomagnetic field , define a cartesian coordinate , @xmath342 in the plane transverse to the shower axis , with @xmath343 aligned to @xmath344 .",
    "the circular symmetry of the shower is distorted depending on @xmath344 , the distance traveled by the muons , and their energy distribution .",
    "for very large zenith angles the pattern results in two lobes on each side of the shower axis , one for the negatively and one for the positively charged muon components . the magnetic deviation @xmath345 experienced by muons of different charges is  @xcite @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the electron charge . combining this with eq .",

    "this occurs because the sm particles live on the brane , so that the relevant phase space for bh decay into these fields is governed by the 4-dimensional projection of the horizon area of the @xmath373-dimensional bh , and by the hawking temperature which is common to bulk and brane .",
    "modulo some grey body factors  @xcite , the dominance of the sm radiation is a result of the much larger number of degrees of freedom .",
    "[ t ]    the choice of a lower limit of integration in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) requires additional explanation .",
    "this limit determines the minimum mass for bhs that will be included in the calculation .",
    "the semiclassical description outlined above is only reliable when the energy of the emitted particle is small compared to the bh mass , because it is only under this condition that both the gravitational field of the brane and the back reaction of the metric during the emission process can be safely neglected  @xcite .",
    "since the total number of particles emitted by the bh is roughly equal to its entropy , @xmath374 the criterion we employ is to assume that the bh has an entropy @xmath375 for @xmath376 and @xmath377 , one finds @xmath378 so that most of the decay process can be well described within the semiclassical approximation .",
    "moreover , the string cross section derived  @xcite from the virasoro - shapiro amplitude is expected to be considerably larger than that given in eq .",
    "( [ hoopsigma ] ) , and so it may be reasonable even to take @xmath379 as low as 1 , for which @xmath380  @xcite .",
    "although the bh production cross section , @xmath381 , is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than qcd cross sections , @xmath382 one of the most startling prdictions of tev - scale gravity theories is that at the lhc , bh events could be filtered out of the qcd background , both in @xmath58  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) as well as in pbpb  @xcite collisions . at energies of interest , however , the cosmic ray luminosity , @xmath383 cm@xmath133 s@xmath384 is about 50 orders of magnitude smaller than the lhc luminosity , thus making it futile to hunt for bhs in baryonic cosmic rays . on the other hand , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ bh ] , although greatly reduced by the cross section for bh production , neutrino interaction lengths are still far larger than the earth s atmospheric depth .",
    "neutrinos therefore would produce bhs with roughly equal probability at any point in the atmosphere . as a result",
    ", the light descendants of the bh may initiate low - altitude , quasi - horizontal showers at rates significantly higher than sm predictions . because of these considerations the atmosphere provides a buffer against contamination by mismeasured baryons ( for which the electromagnetic channel is filtered out ) allowing a good characterization of bh - induced showers when @xmath385  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a similar technique to that employed in discriminating between photon and hadron showers can be applied to isolate bh mediated showers from neutrino sm events  @xcite .",
    "specifically , if an anomalously large quasi - horizontal deep shower rate is found , it may be ascribed to either an enhancement of the incoming neutrino flux , or an enhancement in the neutrino - nucleon cross section .",
    "however , these two possibilities may be distinguished by separately binning events which arrive at very small angles to the horizontal , the so - called `` earth - skimming '' events . an enhanced flux will increase both quasi - horizontal and earth - skimming event rates , whereas a large bh cross section suppresses the latter , because the hadronic decay products of bh evaporation do not escape the earth s crust .    in summary ,",
    "the signal for ultra high energy neutrinos is quasi - horizontal giant air showers initiated deep in the atmosphere : showers with large electromagnetic components , curved fronts , and signals well spread over time .",
    "these shower characteristics are easily differentiated from eas initiated by baryons or photons . the low target density for neutrino interactions provided by the atmosphere",
    "must be compensated by monitoring large areas at the earth s surface . in particular",
    ", the pao will have an acceptance exceeding 1  km@xmath36 of water for @xmath386  gev , and thus will be able to search for extraterrestrial sources of ultra high energy neutrinos .",
    "moreover , this observatory holds great promise for probing physics beyond the sm .",
    "an optimist might even imagine the discovery of microscopic bhs , the telltale signature of the universe s unseen dimensions .",
    "in this article , we have reviewed the general properties and techniques for modelling air showers initiated by ultra high energy particles interacting in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the incidence of a single high energy particle on the upper atmosphere gives rise to a roughly conical cascade of particles which reaches the earth in the form of a giant `` saucer '' traveling at nearly the speed of light .",
    "the number of secondaries in the cascade readily increases through subsequent generations of particle interactions . because of the prompt decay of neutral pions , about 30% of the energy in each generation",
    "is transferred to an electromagnetic cascade .",
    "roughly speaking , at @xmath210  gev , baryons and charged pions have interaction lengths of the order of @xmath387 increasing to about @xmath388 at @xmath389  gev .",
    "additionally , below @xmath33  gev , photons , electrons , and positrons have mean interaction lengths of @xmath390 whereas above this critical energy the competing lpm and geomagnetic effects lead to interaction lengths between @xmath391 .",
    "altogether , the atmosphere acts as a natural colorimeter with variable density , providing a vertical thickness of 26 radiation lengths and about 15 interaction lengths .",
    "amusingly , this is not too different from the number of radiation and interaction lengths at the lhc detectors .",
    "radiation lengths deep , and the hadron calorimeter constitutes 11 interaction lengths . ]",
    "the number of muons does not increase linearly with energy , because of the previously mentioned pionization process : at higher energy more generations are required to cool the pions to the point where they are likely to decay before interaction .",
    "production of extra generations results in a larger fraction of the energy being lost to the electromagnetic cascade , and hence a smaller fraction of the original energy being delivered to the @xmath392 .",
    "ultimately , about 90% of the primary particle s energy is dissipated in the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "the remaining energy is carried by hadrons , as well as muons and neutrinos produced in @xmath392 decays .    by the time they reach the ground ,",
    "relatively vertical showers have evolved fronts with a curvature radius of a few km , and far from the shower core their constituent particles are well spread over time , typically of the order of a few microseconds . for such a shower both the muon component and a large portion of the electromagnetic component survive to reach the ground , and their lateral distributions can be accurately parametrized .",
    "although the lateral distribution function depends on the experiment , surface measurements of both gamma and baryon  induced showers can be fitted with nkg - like formulae . from this distribution",
    "the primary energy can be determined .    for inclined showers the electromagnetic component",
    "is absorbed long before reaching the ground , as it has passed through the equivalent of several vertical atmospheres : 2 at a zenith angle of @xmath34 , 3 at @xmath393 , and 6 at @xmath372 . in these showers ,",
    "only high energy muons created in the first few generations of particles survive past 2 equivalent vertical atmospheres .",
    "the rate of energy attenuation for muons is much smaller than it is for electrons , thus the shape of the resulting shower front is very flat ( with curvature radius above @xmath394 ) , and its time extension is very short ( less than @xmath395 ) .",
    "the damping of the electromagnetic component of the shower provides a means to search for both photon and neutrino primaries .",
    "in particular quasi - horizontal showers with electromagnetic components at the ground would suggest a deeply penetrating primary , such as the elusive ultra high energy neutrino .    as we have seen",
    ", the chief uncertainty in shower modelling arises from lack of definitive knowledge about the nature of hadronic interactions .",
    "this is because the center - of - mass energies involved in cosmic ray collisions are orders of magnitude beyond that achievable in present and foreseeable future experiments .",
    "moreover , man - made accelerators are designed to probe qcd physics in the high tranverse momentum region , and air shower physics is driven by interactions in the very forward direction .",
    "the analysis of extensive air showers then requires the extrapolation of hadronic interaction models more than 2 orders of magnitude in center - of - mass energy beyond the highest accelerator energies ( @xmath396  tev ) to date .",
    "in fact , the required extrapolation is much greater than this because air showers involve nuclei as well as single hadrons both as targets and projectiles .",
    "efforts towards improving our understanding of soft and semi - hard processes are clearly required .",
    "the muon content of the shower tail is quite sensitive to the unknown details of hadronic physics at ultra high energies .",
    "this implies that attempts to extract composition information from measurements of muon content at ground level tend to be systematics dominated .",
    "there are , however , complimentary methods for uncovering the primary species which are less dependent on knowledge of the hadronic physics .",
    "one well - established method involves using fluorescence telescopes to determine the energy dependence of the depth of shower maximum , the so - called elongation rate , which is sensitive to the evolution of the primary composition with energy .",
    "unfortunately , fluorescence detection has its own set of systematic uncertainties associated with the knowledge of atmospheric properties as a function of time .",
    "future hybrid experiments , such as the pao , will record events with simultaneous observation of particles reaching the ground and the shower profile in the atmosphere , and thus provide a new arsenal of data for controlling the systematic errors .",
    "furthermore , the giant aperture of the array will generate an extensive air shower sample of unprecedented size , ushering in a golden age of cosmic ray physics .",

    "<S> the properties of cosmic rays with energies above @xmath0  gev have to be deduced from the spacetime structure and particle content of the air showers which they initiate . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the phenomenology of these giant air showers . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the hadronic interaction models used to extrapolate results from collider data to ultra high energies , and discuss the prospects for insights into forward physics at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe the main electromagnetic processes that govern the longitudinal shower evolution , as well as the lateral spread of particles . </S>",
    "<S> armed with these two principal shower ingredients and motivation from the underlying physics , we provide an overview of some of the different methods proposed to distinguish primary species . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of neutrino interactions and the potential of forthcoming experiments to isolate deeply penetrating showers from baryonic cascades are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we finally venture into a _ terra incognita _ endowed with tev - scale gravity and explore anomalous neutrino - induced showers . </S>"
