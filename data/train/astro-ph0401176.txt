    "in non - magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , a white dwarf primary star is accreting material , via an accretion disc , from a low mass quasi - main sequence secondary star .",
    "the disc instability theory predicts a limit cycle behavior when the mass input rate from the secondary is low : mass gradually accumulates in the disc at low optical brightness ( quiescence ) , then rapidly accretes onto the white dwarf during outburst when the disc is hot and bright in the optical and in the uv ( see a recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "this is widely accepted as the underlying cause of the dwarf nova phenomenon that is seen in the majority of cvs .",
    "in contrast , the mass input rate may be high enough in some cvs for the accretion disc to achieve a steady state .",
    "this is thought to be the explanation for nova - like systems , which resemble dwarf novae in outburst at all times .",
    "simple models suggest that the boundary layer between the primary and the accretion disc should be extremely luminous , emitting up to half the accretion energy .",
    "since most of this is expected to be in x - rays @xcite , x - ray observations have become an essential tool for the study of accretion discs in cvs .",
    "it was discovered early on that dwarf novae in quiescence were moderately bright hard ( 210 kev ) x - ray sources . in outburst , however , the hard component generally became weaker , and sometimes bright soft ( @xmath11 kev ) emission was observed . combining extensive _ einstein _  x - ray data on cvs with theoretical considerations , @xcite linked this to the optical depth in the boundary layer . for low accretion rates ( appropriate for dwarf novae in quiescence ) , the boundary layer is hot ( kt@xmath210 kev ) and optically thin , cooling via hard x - ray bremsstrahlung emission , while for high accretion rates ( dwarf novae in outburst and nova - like systems ) , it becomes optical thick , emitting a blackbody - like spectrum with kt@xmath21050 ev .",
    "optically thin , outer regions of the boundary layer can explain the residual hard x - ray emission .",
    "the recent x - ray , euv , and optical observations of ss  cygni through an outburst @xcite are a recent confirmation of this basic picture .",
    "timing observations of eclipsing systems are invaluable as a method for determining the source of the x - ray emission .",
    "observations of high inclination dwarf novae in quiescence have shown evidence for a compact x - ray source that is eclipsed with the white dwarf @xcite , although the x - ray emission in oy  car  may be from a polar region rather than from an equatorial boundary layer @xcite .",
    "however , the soft x - ray emission from the dwarf nova oy  car  in superoutburst was found to be uneclipsed @xcite .",
    "based on a comparison with lower inclination ( non - eclipsing ) systems , they advocated a two - component origin for the soft x - ray emission from dwarf novae in outbursts : a compact region , presumably the boundary layer , and an extended region , possibly due to the scattering of emission from the former in an accretion disc corona or a wind .",
    "@xcite argued that the white dwarf photosphere and the boundary layer are hidden from our view at all orbital phases in oy  car  in superoutburst , due to the thickened rim of the accretion disc .",
    "later observations of oy  car  in superoutbursts confirm the lack of eclipse and strengthen the scattering interpretation @xcite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _  provides several key advantages in the study of eclipsing cvs , such as the high effective area of the epic instruments both at low and high energies .",
    "we have chosen the nova - like system , ux  uma , as our target for this study , which avoids the logistical complication of scheduling an observation at short notice during an outburst of a dwarf nova .",
    "ux  uma  is the brightest eclipsing nova - like system in the optical and in the x - rays , and has been well studied in ultraviolet in recent years . from uv data ,",
    "@xcite claimed the detection of a white dwarf eclipse , which however has been brought into question by @xcite .",
    "a _ rosat _  pspc observation by @xcite showed no soft x - ray eclipse .",
    ".log of xmm - newton observation 0084190201 of ux  uma . [ cols=\"<,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we have seen in sect .  [ sec : globspec ] how the entire 0.210 .",
    "kev epic spectrum can be adequately fitted with a two component model .",
    "considerable uncertainties remain in the model parameters , and the low energy part of the spectrum can also be described by more complex models ( e.g. , partial covering or partial ionisation ) but this simple and plausible spectral fitting serves to motivate the choice of bandpasses for the light curve extraction .",
    "we have thus extracted the light curves of ux  uma  from the three epic cameras in the energy bands 0.32.0 kev and 3.010 kev .",
    "we then folded each of the 6 light curves on the orbital period , using the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "the folded light curves from the three cameras were then averaged to produce a single folded light curve per energy range .",
    "these are shown in figure[epicfold ] .",
    "the light curves , particularly in the hard band , show considerable variability , often in the form of flare - like events lasting several hundered seconds .",
    "these are not averaged out in the folded light curve because the observation covered only a few cycles .",
    "we confirm the _ rosat _  result @xcite that no eclipse is seen in ux  uma  in the soft x - rays ( @xmath12.0 kev ) .",
    "however , there does appear to be an eclipse in the hard ( @xmath33 kev ) band , at phase 0.0 as defined by optical / uv eclipse . according to @xcite , the white dwarf eclipse width ( mid - ingress to mid - egress )",
    "is 0.053@xmath40.001 cycles , while totality ( 2nd to 3rd contact ) is a little over 0.04 cycles . to investigate the significance of a hard x - ray eclipse with an assumed duration similar to that of the uv eclipse , we have re - folded the data in 25 bins per cycle , with one of the bins centred on the nominal phase 0.0 using the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "the `` eclipse '' bin , ( corresponding to the two lowest points in figure[epicfold ] ) has a count rate of 2.5@xmath41.7 @xmath5 ctss@xmath6 ( the error from propagation of counting errors ) , while the other 24 bins have 34.4@xmath48.5 @xmath5 ctss@xmath6 ( where the error is derived from the standard deviation of these bins , to take into account source variability - see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we thus appear to have detected an eclipse at the 3.8 @xmath7 level .",
    "the hard x - ray eclipse thus appears real , but we are unable to place tight constraints on the parameters",
    ". we can reproduce the eclipse shape with a wide range of parameters ( e.g. , a mid - eclipse phase of 0.00.01 , a mid - eclipse flux between 020% of out - of - eclipse flux , an eclipse width of 0.040.06 cycles , and eclipse transitions of less than @xmath20.01 cycles ) .",
    "the combination of the spectral and timing results strongly suggests that there are ( at least ) two components in the x - ray emission from ux  uma .",
    "the soft component is unabsorbed and uneclipsed and therefore must originate from an extended region .",
    "the hard component , which we have newly discovered , is heavily absorbed and eclipsed .    the soft component in ux  uma  probably has the same origin as that of oy  car  in superoutburst @xcite , and perhaps that of dq  her @xcite .",
    "that is , the likely origin is scattering of centrally generated x - rays in an extended region .",
    "the prominence of the resonance component of the o vii triplet in the rgs spectrum ( figure[rgsspec ] ) supports this interpretation .",
    "@xcite make a strong case that the scattering medium is the accretion disc wind in the case of oy  car  in superoutburst",
    ". this may well be the case in ux  uma , since the system is known to have a strong wind @xcite .",
    "although we have not been able to confirm this by resolving the x - ray lines , our upper limits for their widths ( fwhm of 2000  3000 kms@xmath6 ) are consistent with the fuv line widths ( fwhm @xmath81800 kms@xmath6 ; froning et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the inferred luminosity of the hard component is @xmath9 ergss@xmath6 in the 0.210 kev band for a distance of 345 pc @xcite .",
    "this value is similar to those found for the residual hard x - ray emission component in non - eclipsing dwarf novae in outburst .",
    "@xcite infer a bolometric luminosity of @xmath10 ergss@xmath6 for z  cam in outburst from _ asca _  data ( where there is an additional softer component , which we would not see in ux  uma  due to the absorber ) , while the hard x - ray component of ss cyg in outburst reaches a minimum at about @xmath11 ergss@xmath6 in 320 kev in the _ rxte _  data @xcite .",
    "in all three systems , the existing spectra can be fitted with a single temperature thermal model with kt in the 510 kev range .",
    "these similarities both in luminosity and in temperature suggest that the hard x - ray component that we have discovered in ux  uma  is the same as the hard x - ray emission seen in dwarf novae in outburst .",
    "the detection of a hard x - ray eclipse allows us to rule out an extended origin for this emission , such as was suggested ( for ss cyg in outburst ) by @xcite .",
    "if the emission is coming from a compact region close to the white dwarf , the most natural source at this position would be the boundary layer . at first sight",
    ", this may seem an odd suggestion , since the boundary layer is normally thought of as a source of soft x - rays , and in an eclipsing system , is hidden behind the disc rim .",
    "however , uv observations suggest that a disc rim can supply a column density of @xmath12 @xmath13 in oy car @xcite , and that the absorber in ux  uma  appears to result in deeper absorption in the uv than that seen in oy  car  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our spectral fits suggest a column of this order of magnitude .",
    "pending more detailed analysis , we suggest that the same material can be responsible for both x - ray and uv absorptions .",
    "crucially , such a column is sufficient to extinguish a soft x - ray source , but will not significantly affect x - rays above 5 kev .",
    "thus these x - rays may well be coming from the more tenuous parts of the boundary layer @xcite .",
    "we require more sensitive hard x - ray observations of ux  uma  ( such as a longer observation with _ xmm - newton _ ) to use the eclipse light curves to constrain the nature of the hard x - ray emission in these systems . at the same time",
    ", better quality spectra of the soft component are required to study the kinematics of the soft x - ray scattering region in ux  uma .",
