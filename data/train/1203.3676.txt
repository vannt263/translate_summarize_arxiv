    "laser stabilization techniques and studies in laser physics often require the generation of frequency shifted radiation that is otherwise coherent with light from a master laser source , as do many experiments in atomic or molecular physics  particularly those which address hyperfine atomic structure @xcite .",
    "this is typically achieved with an acousto - optic ( aom ) @xcite or electro - optic modulator ( eom ) @xcite , or via current modulation of a semiconductor laser @xcite .",
    "it is usually necessary to separate the frequency - shifted radiation from the unshifted carrier wave . while trivial with an aom , carrier extraction is less straightforward when the modulation frequency merits use of an eom , and several techniques have been developed for this purpose @xcite .",
    "established methods generally operate by separating light according to its wavelength , and have two major drawbacks .",
    "firstly , interferometric methods require sophisticated and costly apparatus to stabilize a resonant cavity or other optical path with sub - wavelength accuracy @xcite and a vibration - free environment is essential .",
    "secondly , wavelength - dependent techniques are inappropriate if rapid changes in modulation frequency are to be accommodated . indeed , many schemes are only able to operate at a single modulation frequency @xcite .    with electro - optic modulation ,",
    "the sidebands may in principle be at least partially separated from the carrier using polarization techniques , as they do not necessarily share its polarization state , but the temperature - dependent birefringence of the modulator necessitates continuous adjustments if carrier extinction is to be maintained . here",
    "we present a scheme in which this birefringence is actively compensated by a liquid crystal cell , allowing carrier suppression to be maintained at over 28  db , albeit at the expense of a 6.5  db attenuation of the desired sideband .",
    "our simple and economical approach avoids wavelength - scale optical path stabilization and can function continuously irrespective of changes in modulation frequency .",
    "most electro - optic modulators affect only a single linear polarization component of the incident light field @xcite .",
    "we consider an eom which , driven at a frequency @xmath0 , achieves a modulation depth @xmath1 @xcite for the modulated polarization component of incident light with a frequency @xmath2 .",
    "if the incident beam is linearly polarized @xcite with ( real ) amplitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the modulated and unmodulated directions respectively , then the phase - modulated output may be written @xmath5 decomposing the modulated polarization into the resulting frequency components using the jacobi - anger identity yields @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath8th order bessel function of the first kind ; the first term represents the carrier wave and the remaining terms represent the sidebands . if the carrier wave is removed by a polarizer aligned so that its transmission axis is orthogonal to the polarization plane of the emerging carrier , then the transmitted sidebands will be @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angle between the polarizer s transmission axis and the modulated direction .",
    "the fraction of the incident power emerging in each of the first - order ( @xmath11 ) sidebands is therefore @xmath12 ^{2}\\ } } .\\ ] ] this is maximized ( for modulation depth @xmath1 ) when @xmath13 .",
    "the system then retains a proportion of the sideband power that would be available without carrier removal equal to @xmath14 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ powerplot ] .    the crystals upon which electro - optic modulators are usually based exhibit substantial birefringence , which introduces a phase difference between the polarization components in the modulated and unmodulated directions @xcite , changing the polarization from linear to elliptical and thereby reducing the attenuation of the carrier wave by the polarizing filter .",
    "additional polarization optics must therefore be introduced to counteract this effect .",
    "a suitable passive set - up , using a half - wave plate and a quarter - wave plate , is shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram](a ) .",
    "however , since the birefringence of the crystal changes with temperature , long - term stability requires either precise temperature stabilization or feedback control of the extra polarization components .    to achieve this",
    ", we use an e7 liquid crystal cell @xcite as a voltage - controlled wave plate , similar to that discussed in @xcite . the arrangement for this",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram](b ) .",
    "such cells can readily be produced via the method detailed in @xcite and are also available commercially @xcite .",
    "the liquid crystal shows a birefringence which depends upon the amplitude of an ac voltage applied across it ; we use a 1  khz sine wave , and find that the phase difference between the two polarizations can be varied ( approximately linearly , as apparent in fig .  [ errsig ] ) by several cycles as the peak - to - peak voltage is increased from 1.2  v to 2.6  v. we do not see any modulation of the birefringence at the frequency of the ac signal .",
    "we generate an error signal by using a quarter - wave plate and polarizing beam splitter to direct opposite circular polarization components onto the pair of photodiodes in fig .",
    "[ diagram](b ) , as in the popular spectroscopy arrangement of hnsch and couillaud @xcite .",
    "this is fed back to the liquid crystal cell through a servo controller that determines the amplitude of the ac modulation @xcite . with the axes of the quarter - wave plate making angles of @xmath15 with the axes of the polarizing beam splitter , the two photodiode signals are @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 represents the photodiode sensitivity and @xmath18 is the net birefringent phase difference introduced by the eom and the liquid crystal cell .",
    "thus the error signal is given by @xmath19 which has a finite gradient and takes a value of zero at @xmath20 , as required for locking of @xmath18 to zero .",
    "the linearly polarized sidebands are divided equally between the two photodiodes and hence do not contribute to the error signal .",
    "both systems shown in fig .  [ diagram ] were constructed and their outputs were observed using an optical spectrum analyser . figs .  [ spectra ] and [ logspec ]",
    "show spectra of the light produced without ( a ) and with ( b ) active carrier removal ( we used a modulation depth of @xmath21  radians ) .",
    "similar results could be obtained over short periods with the passive arrangement of fig .",
    "[ diagram](a ) , giving instantaneous carrier extinction levels in excess of 30 db ( consistent with the performance of the polarizing beam splitters ) , but variations in birefringence within the eom caused the carrier transmission to increase to over 2% after only five minutes of operation . with the active stabilization of fig .",
    "[ diagram](b ) , the carrier could be suppressed indefinitely , and we recorded a time - averaged carrier wave suppression over a period of 2.5 hours of 28.8 db [ 20 ] .",
    "[ logspec ] shows that the sideband powers were attenuated by 6.5 db , in good agreement with equation ( 4 ) .",
    "experimental values of carrier transmission and error signal , @xmath22 , are plotted against the peak to peak voltage applied to the liquid crystal cell ( @xmath23 ) in fig .",
    "[ errsig ] .",
    "the behavior of the error signal is consistent with that expected theoretically , with @xmath22 crossing zero at the minimum of carrier transmission and the variation of the signal with @xmath23 being approximately sinusoidal between 1.2  v and 2.6  v.    there is a small but systematic difference in magnitude between the positive and negative going parts of the error signal , not predicted by equation ( 6 ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to etalon effects in the ( uncoated ) liquid crystal cell , with reflections at the glass  liquid crystal interfaces causing the transmission to vary slightly with changes in the optical path length of the cell .",
    "although the lock point of the birefringence compensation is independent of @xmath1 , changes in modulation depth would require realignment of the polarizing beam splitter ( or in our case the half - wave plate ) on the output branch in order to maintain the condition @xmath24 .",
    "a signal could be generated to control this by splitting the beam on the monitoring branch ( before the quarter - wave plate ) and creating a new branch as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram](b ) . with @xmath18",
    "locked to zero and the modulated polarization component making an angle of @xmath15 with the axes of the polarizing beam splitter , the signal produced by the photodiode , @xmath25 , could be normalised to give : @xmath26}{k a^{2 } } = \\frac{1}{2 } +   \\cos{\\vartheta } \\sin{\\vartheta } j_{0}(m )   .\\ ] ] this gives a measure of @xmath27 that could be used to adjust the radio frequency power with which the eom is supplied , in order to maintain a constant modulation depth .",
    "alternatively it could be used to control a motorized wave plate or other additional polarizing components that would allow adjustment of the system to cope with changes in modulation depth .",
    "we have demonstrated a method for removing the carrier wave from an electro - optically phase - modulated spectrum that is unaffected by changes in modulation frequency and both easier to implement and more robust than most existing schemes .",
    "it achieves these advantages at the expense of a substantial loss ( @xmath2875% at low modulation index ) in total power , making it useful when spectral purity is more important than absolute power . using a hnsch - couillaud stabilization method ,",
    "we have demonstrated carrier suppression of over 28 db , limited mainly by the extinction ratio of the polarizing beam splitters , which can be maintained for a number of hours . we have suggested a scheme by which any changes in modulation depth , which determines the polarizer alignment , could be monitored and actively compensated .",
