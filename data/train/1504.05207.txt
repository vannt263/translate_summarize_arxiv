    "in 1979 , su , schrieffer and heeger ( ssh ) introduced a simple microscopic model of polyacetylene with a modulation of the electronic hopping as a result of distortions of the carbon bonds @xcite .",
    "it has since gained a much wider relevance due to the fact that it supports topological excitations ( solitons ) with fractional charge @xcite , and its relation to one - dimensional topological insulators @xcite in the bdi class @xcite . as a model for correlated electrons ,",
    "the case of a half - filled band has attracted particular interest , because it supports a peierls and ( in the presence of coulomb interaction ) a mott insulating phase .",
    "if the lattice is treated quantum mechanically , the model constitutes a rich and complex many - body problem .    in the adiabatic limit ( or at the mean - field level ) , a dimerized peierls state results at @xmath1 for any nonzero electron - phonon coupling @xcite . although a classical treatment of the lattice ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) appears justified for polyacetylene given the large oscillator mass @xcite , quantum fluctuations of the lattice cause a significant reduction of the dimerization @xcite and affect the low - lying excitations @xcite .",
    "quite surprisingly , numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite results for the ssh model without electron - electron interaction suggest that lattice fluctuations do not destroy the peierls state , in contrast to the spinless ssh model @xcite or holstein models @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the peierls state does become unstable with respect to quantum fluctuations if additional coulomb repulsion between electrons is taken into account , as appropriate for polyacetylene @xcite .",
    "in fact , the single - particle gap found experimentally has been argued to be predominantly a result of electronic correlations , with only a small component from the dimerization of the lattice @xcite .",
    "a finite phonon frequency may also crucially affect the balance between interactions @xcite .",

    "the momentum dependence of the phonon dispersion and the interaction make numerical studies of the ssh model more challenging than for models with a holstein interaction @xcite .",

    ", some of the recent numerical work has focused on a simplified model with optical phonons and a different interaction term @xcite . while theory suggests that the low - energy physics depends solely on the phonon frequency at @xmath3 @xcite ,",
