    "we consider the two - user gaussian multi - input multi - output broadcast channel with confidential messages ( mimo - bcc ) , where the transmitter sends two confidential messages to receivers  and  , respectively , while keeping each of them secret to the unintended receiver . by letting @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 denote the number of antennas at the transmitter , receiver  , and receiver  , respectively ,",
    "the corresponding channel outputs are given by    @xmath3    where @xmath4 denotes the observations at the receiver and , respectively , at time instant @xmath5 ; @xmath6 are the associated channel matrices ; @xmath7 are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) additive white gaussian noises @xmath8 ; the input vector @xmath9 is subject to the average power constraint @xmath10 furthermore , as in @xcite , we assume any arbitrary stationary fading process such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are mutually independent and change from an instant to another one in an independent manner . note that the channel at hand boils down to the conventional gaussian mimo wiretap channel where the transmitter wishes to send one message to the intended receiver while keeping it secret to the other one , namely , the eavesdropper .",
    "the secrecy capacity region of the two - user mimo gaussian bcc with perfect channel state information at transmitter  ( csit)and receivers has been characterized in @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "as a special case , the gaussian mimo wiretap channel has been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the secrecy capacity of the mimo gaussian wiretap channel with general  ( imperfect ) csi at the transmitter remains open . since",
    "a complete characterization of the capacity region in this case is very difficult  ( if not impossible ) , a number of contributions have focused on the so - called secrecy degrees of freedom  ( sdof ) , by capturing the behavior in high signal - to - noise  ( snr ) regime  ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "references @xcite investigated the compound models where channel uncertainty at the encoder is modeled as a set of finite channel states , while @xcite investigated the scenario where the transmitter knows some temporal structure of the block - fading processes .",
    "a fundamental observation is that unless two channels enjoy asymmetric statistical properties , the perfect secrecy can not be guaranteed under a general csit assumption . in other words , if the statistics of the underlying channels seen by both receivers are symmetrical , additional side information  ( not necessarily instantaneous csit ) is essential to ensure a positive sdof , by introducing some asymmetry at the encoder . as a matter of fact",
    ", this reveals one of the major limitations of the wiretap model whose performance strongly depends on the quality of the channel state information at the transmitter side .",
    "evidently , theoretically addressing csi issues is of fundamental impact for secrecy systems .",
    "recently , in the context of multi - antenna broadcast channel , the pioneering work  @xcite showed that completely outdated channel state information at the transmitter is still very useful and increases the degrees of freedom of the multi - user channel .",
    "motivated by this exciting result , the new assumption , commonly referred to as delayed csit , has since been applied to several multi - user settings , including the mimo broadcast channel , x channel , and interference channel  @xcite .",
    "non - trivial gain of degrees of freedom have been shown in all these settings with delayed csit .",
    "the main idea behind the utility of delayed csit can be best described with the term `` retrospective interference alignment '' introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "that is , the knowledge of causal channel state is used to align the interference between users into a spatial / temporal subspace with a reduced dimension at each receiver .    in this paper , we study the impact of delayed csit on the secrecy degrees of freedom in a mimo broadcast channel . in our setting ,",
    "delayed csi of a given receiver is available both at the transmitter and the other receiver and @xmath13 for every @xmath14 . ] , whereas each receiver knows its own instantaneous channel .",
    "such a scenario is of practical interest since the receivers may send their channel states to the transmitter via delayed feedback links that may be overheard by the other receivers .",
    "we first characterize the optimal sdof of the gaussian mimo wiretap channel with delayed csit .",
    "it is shown that delayed csit can significantly improve the sdof , provided that the number of transmit antennas is larger than that of receive antennas , i.e. , @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", we prove that a simple artificial noise alignment ( ana ) scheme achieves the optimal sdof . the proposed scheme sends the confidential symbols embedded by the artificial noise in such a way that the artificial noise is aligned in a subspace at the legitimate receiver while it fills the full signal space at the eavesdropper .",
    "the case of partial knowledge where the transmitter has delayed csi only on the legitimate channel is also investigated . in this case , we show that a strictly smaller sdof is achieved compared to the case with delayed csit on both channels .",
    "then , we consider the two - user gaussian mimo - bcc and characterize the optimal sdof region .",
    "the achievability follows from an artificial noise alignment scheme adapted to convey two confidential messages .",
    "the proposed scheme can be seen as a non - trivial extension of the maddah - ali  tse  ( mat ) scheme .",
    "a simple comparison with the mat scheme enables us to quantify the resource overhead , or equivalently the dof loss , to be paid to guarantee the confidentiality of messages .",
    "although delayed csit is found beneficial for a large range of transmit antennas analogy to the conclusions drawn for other network systems without secrecy constraints @xcite , we remark that the lack of perfect csit significantly degrades the performance of the secrecy systems .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : preliminaries ] introduces the assumptions and some useful lemmas while section  [ section : mainresults ] summarizes our main results on the optimal sdof .",

    "same steps can be applied to obtain .",

    ", we have @xmath71    let @xmath72 be the @xmath73 non - zero singular values of @xmath69 .",
    "then , we have that @xmath74 since the non - zero singular values do not depend on @xmath70 and thus do not vanish with @xmath70 either .",
    "in this section , we highlight our main results on the optimal sdof of the gaussian mimo wiretap channel and then on the more general gaussian mimo broadcast channel with confidential messages .",
    "we shall interpret the results through comparisons and numerical evaluations .",
    "[ thm : sdof ] in presence of delayed csit on both the legitimate channel and the eavesdropper channel , the optimal sdof of the gaussian mimo wiretap channel with @xmath75 antennas at the transmitter , the legitimate receiver , the eavesdropper , respectively , is given by @xmath76    in the wiretap setting , it is not always reasonable to assume any csi on the eavesdropper channel at the transmitter side . in this case , we may consider delayed csit only on the legitimate channel and without csit on the eavesdropper channel",
    ". with this asymmetric csi assumption , hereafter referred to as delayed partial csit , we can show that a strictly positive yet smaller sdof than delayed csit on both channels is still achievable for a wide range of number of antennas .",
    "[ thm : asymmetric ] in presence of delayed partial csit , either on the legitimate channel or the eavesdropper channel , the following sdof is achievable for mimo gaussian wiretap channel for @xmath77 @xmath78    note that it is the best known achievable sdof in this setting , although the converse is yet to be proved .    in order to quantify the benefit of delayed csit , we summarize the sdof with perfect , delayed and without csit in table [ table : sdof ] and provide an example with @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdof ] .",
    "we remark that delayed csit is beneficial only when the number of transmit antennas is larger than the number of receive antennas , i.e. , @xmath80 , since the sdof is @xmath81 for @xmath82 with perfect , delayed , and without csit . as the number @xmath0 of transmit antennas increases , the sdof grows until @xmath83 for perfect and delayed csit while it does not increase with @xmath0 without csit .",
    "it appears that with both perfect and delayed csit , we can not exploit any gain for @xmath0 beyond @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , we remark that delayed csit only on the legitimate channel incurs a non - negligible loss compared to delayed csit on both channels .",
    "this is because the transmitter without csi on the eavesdropper channel can not access to the signal overheard by the eavesdropper , which reduces the signal dimension to be exploited by the legitimate receiver .",
    ".comparison of the sdof under different csit assumptions for @xmath85 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : length2 ]    the corner points can be achieved by the ana scheme described in section [ section : proof - wiretap ] . here",
    ", we provide a strategy achieving the sum sdof point .",
    "in fact , the ana scheme for the mimo wiretap channel in section [ section : proof - wiretap ] can be suitably modified to convey two confidential messages .",

    "the observations are given by    @xmath106    first , we examine the mutual information between @xmath94 and @xmath107 : @xmath108 where in ( [ eq : structure2 ] ) the first term is due to the block - triangular structure of @xmath109 and the second term follows because the rank corresponds to the rank of the identity matrix ; ( [ chooseb ] ) follows by choosing @xmath110 given in ( [ matrixb ] ) where we replace @xmath100 with @xmath111 .    next , in order to examine the leakage of @xmath94 to receiver  , we write @xmath112 where follows from the markov chain @xmath113 ; is due to another markov chain @xmath114 ; in we notice that two block columns of @xmath115 is block - triangular and the second term follows by keeping only linearly independent block rows ; the last equality is obtained by setting @xmath116 given in . as a result ,",
