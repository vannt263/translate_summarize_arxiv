    "this paper is about _ leaky dynamical systems _ or dynamical systems with _",
    "a generic setup consists of a triple @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the phase space of a map or flow denoted by @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is an open set .",
    "we refer to @xmath4 as a _ closed system _ and @xmath5 as the hole through which mass is allowed to escape from the system .",
    "more precisely , we follow trajectories in @xmath1 until they enter @xmath5 . once a point enters @xmath5 , it leaves the system forever , i.e. we stop considering it .    holes can be large or small .",
    "small holes are often used to model small ( unintended ) leaks in physical systems ; proximity of normalized surviving distributions to the physical measure of the closed system is a form of stability .",
    "more generally , the study of @xmath0 can be viewed as the study of dynamics on _ non - invariant domains_. as an example of why such studies are relevant , consider the following .",
    "it is well known that attractors are important because they capture the large - time behavior of dynamical systems , but invariant sets that are not attracting can substantially impact the qualitative behavior of a system as well : let @xmath6 be such a set , and @xmath7 a neighborhood of @xmath8",
    ". then we may regard @xmath9 as the hole .",
    "slow escape rates from such holes are known to impact the speed of correlation decay of the closed system .",
    "escape dynamics have been studied by many authors .",
    "we refer the reader to the part - review article @xcite , which contains many references , and will mention explicitly works that are closer to the present paper as we go along .",
    "most previous works have focused on specific systems , such as anosov diffeomorphisms , interval and billiard maps . in this paper",
    ", we seek a general understanding for as large a class of dynamical systems as we can .",
    "specifically , we seek to relate escape rate to a dynamical invariant called _ pressure _ , which roughly speaking measures the discrepancy between metric entropy and sum of positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "we now proceed to a discussion of what this paper is about .    *",
    "setting and questions *    we begin with the simpler setting of a compact riemannian manifold @xmath1 without boundary and a diffeomorphism @xmath2 which is at least @xmath10 for some @xmath11 . in order to include applications to systems such as billiards , which are very important examples of dynamical systems of physical origin",
    ", we also allow @xmath1 to be the union of a ( possibly open ) riemannian manifold and a singularity set @xmath12 , and @xmath2 to be piecewise smooth .",
    "precise conditions on @xmath12 and the behavior of @xmath2 near it will be introduced in section 2 .",
    "riemannian measure on @xmath1 ( or @xmath13 ) is denoted by @xmath14 throughout . unless otherwise stated , the hole @xmath5 is an arbitrary open set in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a reference measure on @xmath1 .",
    "we think of @xmath15 as the initial distribution of mass in the phase space before any escape takes place , and take the view that initial distributions related to @xmath14 are of particular physical interest .",
    "notice that @xmath15 need not be @xmath2-invariant . indeed one can interpret the situation as follows : the escape of mass can begin before or after the closed system @xmath16 reaches a steady state . in the first case , @xmath15 is usually not invariant , and we assume it has a density with respect to @xmath14 . in the second case ,",
    "we take @xmath15 to be an srb measure , which may be singular with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "a basic quantity of interest is the _ escape rate _ ,",
    "defined to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 when the limit exists . here",
    "@xmath19 is the set of points which has not escaped by time @xmath20 . in general , the limit in ( [ eq : escape def ] ) may not exist , and we write @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the quantity on the right hand side .",
    "notice that while @xmath25 depends on @xmath15 , all initial distributions uniformly equivalent to @xmath15 have the same escape rate , i.e. if @xmath26 is a function with @xmath27 for some @xmath28 , then @xmath29 , and the same is true for @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ".    for an @xmath2-invariant borel probability measure @xmath30 on @xmath1 , the _ pressure _ of @xmath30 , denoted @xmath31 , is defined to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the metric entropy of @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents counted with multiplicity .",
    "we will write @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a collection of invariant measures .",

    "let @xmath42 denote the set of @xmath2-invariant borel probability measures supported on @xmath41 , and let @xmath43 be the subset of @xmath44 consisting of ergodic measures .",
    "assuming @xmath25 is well defined , we say @xmath25 satisfies a _ variational principle _ if @xmath45 of interest also is whether the supremum in @xmath46 is attained , i.e. if there is a measure @xmath47 for which @xmath48 . obviously , one can also ask if @xmath49 for some @xmath30 without mentioning any variational principles .",
    "the ideas in the last paragraph were suggested by a number of previously known results some of which are recalled below , but let us first summarize the questions to be addressed .    this paper seeks to address for as large a class of dynamical systems as possible the following three questions for natural initial distributions @xmath15 :    _ _    * * ( escape rate ) * is the escape rate @xmath50 well defined ? * * ( formula for escape rate ) * is @xmath51 for some @xmath52 ? + the same question can be posed for @xmath53 and @xmath54 . * * ( variational principle ) *  does @xmath25 satisfy a variational principle ?",
