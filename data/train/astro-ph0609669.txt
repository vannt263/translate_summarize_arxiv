    "the vast majority ( perhaps all ) of stars are formed in a clustered fashion . however , only a very small percentage of older stars are found in bound clusters .",
    "these two observations highlight the importance of clusters in the star - formation process and the significance of cluster disruption .",
    "the process of cluster disruption begins soon after , or concurrent with , cluster formation .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath3 of stars formed in embedded clusters end up in bound clusters after @xmath4  yr .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that at least 20% , but perhaps all , star formation in the merging antennae galaxies is taking place in clusters , the majority of which are likely to become unbound .",
    "the case is similar in m51 , with @xmath5 of all young ( @xmath6  myr ) clusters likely to be destroyed within the first 10s of myr of their lives @xcite . on longer timescales , @xcite and",
    "@xcite noted a clear lack of older ( @xmath7  few gyr ) open clusters in the solar neighbourhood and @xcite found a strong absence of older clusters in m51 , m33 , smc , and the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the lack of old open clusters in the solar neighbourhood is even more striking when compared with the lmc , which contains a significant number of ` blue globular clusters ' with ages well in excess of a gyr ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this difference can be understood either as a difference in the formation history of clusters or as a difference in the disruption timescales .",
    "this later scenario was suggested by @xcite , who directly compared the age distribution of galactic open clusters and the smc cluster population .",
    "he noted that there are @xmath8 times more clusters with an age of 1 gyr in the smc as compared to the solar neighbourhood ( when normalising both populations to an age of @xmath9  yr ) and concluded that disruption mechanisms must be less efficient in the smc .",
    "much theoretical work has gone into the later scenario , with both analytic and numerical models of cluster evolution predicting a strong influence of the galactic tidal field on the dissolution of star clusters ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "only recently has there been a large push to understand cluster disruption from an observational standpoint in various external potentials , making explicit comparison with models @xcite .",
    "we direct the reader to the review by larsen in these proceedings for a historical look at the observations and theory of cluster disruption .      while cluster disruption is a gradual process with several different disruptive agents at work",
    "simultaneously , one can distinguish three general phases of cluster mass loss and disruption .",
    "as we will see , a large fraction of clusters gets destroyed during the _ primary _ phase .",
    "the main phases and corresponding typical timescales of cluster disruption are : _",
    "i ) infant mortality _ ( @xmath0  yr ) , _ ii ) stellar evolution _",
    "( @xmath1  yr ) and _ iii ) tidal relaxation _ ( @xmath2  yr ) . during all three phases",
    "there are additional tidal external perturbations from e.g. giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , the galactic disc and spiral arms that heat the cluster and speed up the process of disruption .",
    "however , these external perturbations operate on longer timescales for cluster populations and so are most important in phase iii . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] we schematically illustrate the three phases of disruption and the involved time - scales .",
    "note that the number of disruptive agents decreases in time .    in this review",
    "we will focus on the physics and observations of phase i as well as on recent population studies aimed at understanding phases ii and iii on a statistical basis .",
    "for a recent review on the physics of phases ii and iii , we refer the reader to @xcite .        before proceeding , it is worthwhile to consider our definition of a cluster",
    ". @xcite defines a cluster to be a _ gravitationally bound _",
    "stellar association which will survive for 1020 crossing times .",
    "this definition implies that the stars provide enough gravitational potential to bind the cluster and ignores the role of gas in the early evolution of clusters . in this review",
    ", we will define a cluster as a collection of gas and stars which was _ initially gravitationally bound_. the reason for this definition will become evident in section  [ infantmortality ]",
    "recent studies on the populations of young star clusters in m51 @xcite and the antennae galaxies @xcite have shown a large excess of star clusters with ages less than @xmath1010  myr with respect to what would be expected assuming a constant cluster formation rate .",
    "the fact that open clusters in the solar neighbourhood display a similar trend @xcite has led to the conclusion that this is a physical effect and not simply that we are observing these galaxies at a special time in their star - formation history .",
    "if one adopts this view , then we are forced to conclude that the majority ( between 60 - 90% ) of star clusters become unbound when the remaining gas ( i.e. gas that is left - over from the star formation process ) is expelled .",
    "these clusters will survive less than a few crossing times .",
    "suppose that a star cluster is formed out of a sphere of gas with an efficiency @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "further suppose that the gas and stars are initially in virial equilibrium .",
    "if we define the virial parameter as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the kinetic energy and @xmath15 the potential energy , virial equilibrium implies @xmath16 .",
    "finally , suppose that the remaining gas is removed on a timescale faster than the crossing time of stars in the cluster .",
    "in such a scenario the cluster is left in a super - virial state after the gas removal , with @xmath17 , and the star cluster will expand since the binding energy is too low for the stellar velocities",
    ". the expanding cluster will reach virial equilibrium after a few crossing times , but only after a ( possibly large ) fraction of the stars have escaped .",
    "this process has been shown to remove a significant amount of the stellar mass of a cluster , and if @xmath18 the entire cluster will become unbound on a timescale of 10s of myr @xcite .",
    "rapid gas removal of the type discussed above leaves distinct observables . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the surface brightness profiles of three young clusters ( left panels ) as well as two results of @xmath19-body simulations ( right panels ) of clusters including the effects of rapid gas removal .",
    "all three young clusters show an excess of light at large radii with respect to the best fitting eff  @xcite or @xcite profiles .",
    "this is in good agreement with the predictions of the simulations , in which an unbound halo of stars is removed ( although still appearing to be associated with the cluster for 10s of myr ) due to the rapid change of the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "such excess light at large radii has also been found in young clusters in the antennae galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that for values of @xmath11 of 0.1 and 0.6 , clusters will lose 75% and 10% of the stellar mass respectively within the first @xmath20  myr of their lives .",
    "thus we see that this is an extremely efficient way to rapidly disperse stars from young clusters into the field .",
    "this mechanism provides a natural explanation for the observed diffuse uv light in the field of starburst galaxies @xcite and supports the scenario of these authors that this light is due to rapidly dispersing young clusters .",
    "whether or not a cluster survives this phase , and hence more than 1020 crossing times , is largely dependent on the star - formation efficiency of the gmc core in which the cluster formed .",
    "thus , two clusters with exactly the same parameters ( radius , mass , metallicity , external potential field , etc ) may experience two radically different evolutionary paths if their star - formation efficiencies are different . @xcite",
    "have used the internal dynamical properties of young clusters in order to estimate their @xmath11-values .",
    "no clear trend of @xmath11 on cluster ( stellar ) mass or radius was found .",
    "-body simulations which include the rapid removal of gas which was left over from a non-100% star - formation efficiency ( right ) .",
    "the solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) lines are the best fitting eff  @xcite and king  @xcite profiles respectively .",
    "note the excess of light at large radii with respect to the best fitting eff profile in both the observations and models .",
    "this excess light is due to an unbound expanding halo of stars caused by the rapid ejection of the remaining gas after the cluster forms .",
    "_ hence , excess light at large radii strongly implies that these clusters are not in dynamical equilibrium . _ for details of the modeling and observations see @xcite and @xcite.,height=340 ]      even if a cluster survives the gas removal phase , this phase can significantly effect the observed properties of the cluster .",
    "hence , deducing the initial properties of a cluster from its current state is not trivial . @xcite",
    "have noted the strong effect of residual gas removal on inferring the initial stellar mass of a cluster , while @xcite have refined the mass loss estimates and shown that measurements of the current radii of young clusters may not reflect the initial nor the final value .",
    "additionally , @xcite show that this effect can mimic stellar imf variations in young clusters .",
    "the clusters that have survived the gas removal phase are subject to disruption phases ii and iii (   [ subsec : phases ] ) as well as tidal effects .",
    "disruption due to these effects can be studied on individual clusters , of which the recent observations of the dissolving globular clusters palomar 5 @xcite are probably the most spectacular example . however ,",
    "much can be learned by approaching this problem from a cluster population point of view .",
    "suppose that clusters are formed continuously with a constant cluster formation rate ( a constraint which we can relax later ) .",
    "also , we will assume that we know the cluster initial mass function ( here taken to be a power law of the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( e.g.  @xcite ) and that clusters can be detected down to a known magnitude limit .",
    "finally , we will assume that the disruption time of a cluster depends on the cluster mass , such that more massive clusters survive longer ( on average ) than lower mass clusters .",
    "for this final assumption we will adopt a function of the form :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the disruption time of a @xmath25 cluster and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the beauty of this formulation is that it only has two variables , @xmath24 and @xmath27 , and as we will see , provides extremely good fits to observations .",
    "the formulation provided above , when combined with the given assumptions , allows for the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath27 to be found from age and mass distributions of clusters . the first survey using this technique",
    "was carried out by @xcite on cluster populations in m51 , m33 , the smc , and the solar neighbourhood .",
    "they made a _ sudden disruption _",
    "assumption , meaning that the cluster is in the sample with its initial mass until , when it is disrupted .",
    "the somewhat surprising result from this study was that , while @xmath27 had more or less the same value in all environments studied ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath24 varied by over two orders of magnitude , with values of @xmath29  myr in the central regions of m51 to @xmath30  gyr in the smc .    the simple _ sudden disruption _",
    "assumption was improved in a more recent model by @xcite , where a gradual loss of cluster mass was implemented .",
    "they assumed that the cluster mass decreases exponentially with a time - scale that decreases as the cluster mass decreases .",
    "this is done by saying that the mass loss per unit time ( ) relates to  as :    @xmath31    with @xmath32 from eq .",
    "[ eq : ihavebeentypingthisequationtoomuchinmylife ] .",
    "this very simple analytical description for cluster mass loss shows remarkably good agreement when compared to the mass loss following from the detailed @xmath19-body simulations of @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ dm_lamers ] we show a direct comparison of @xmath33 from the @xmath19-body simulations of clusters with different density profiles and on different orbits ( left ) and the above mentioned analytical model of @xcite ( right ) .    in both graphs the time is normalised to  and only the mass loss due to stars escaping the cluster is shown , i.e. mass loss due to stellar evolution ( sev ) is not shown .",
    "in addition , there is a coupling between the two types of mass loss : if stars loose mass , the cluster will expand and more stars are pushed over the tidal boundary .",
    "the simulations of @xcite considered sev , therefore , their  results shown in fig .  [ dm_lamers ] do include tidal induced by sev .",

    "this method has two distinct advantages over the earlier formulations .",

    "the first comes from @xcite who find that in the antennae galaxies the number of clusters decreases in time ( @xmath36 ) as @xmath37 , independent of cluster mass .",
    "this may be explained if the disruption timescale @xmath24 due to tidal field effects ( e.g. phase ii & iii ) is greater than or similar to the maximum age in the sample .",
    "the cluster disruption due to tidal effects would not yet be present in the @xcite sample , instead the decrease in cluster numbers would be the result of infant mortality and the fading of clusters .",
    "studies of infant mortality in m51 also suggest that the effect is mass independent @xcite .",
    "in fact , if infant mortality was not ( mostly ) independent of cluster mass we would expect the embedded cluster mass function to be significantly different from the optically selected cluster mass function .    in fig .",
