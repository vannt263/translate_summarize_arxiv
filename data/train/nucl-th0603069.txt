    "self - consistent mean - field methods are one of the standard microscopic approaches in nuclear structure theory @xcite . at present , they are the only available microscopic method that can be systematically applied on a large scale for medium and heavy nuclei . the full model space of occupied states can be used , which removes any distinction between core and valence particles and the need for effective charges .",
    "this allows the use of a universal effective interaction , universal in the sense that it can be applied for all nuclei throughout the periodic chart .    despite its successes ,",
    "the self - consistent mean - field method has a number of well - known limitations . from a conceptual point of view",
    ", the mean - field approach is designed to describe mainly ground - state properties , and gives very limited access to excited states .",
    "this is in contrast to the microscopic methods that are available for light nuclei , like the no - core shell model and the shell - model monte - carlo , which also describe excitation spectra . a systematic way to resolve these problems",
    "is offered by symmetry restoration and configuration mixing .",
    "several groups now develop methods going beyond a mean - field approach based on the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , either with non - relativistic skyrme @xcite or gogny @xcite interactions , or with relativistic lagrangians @xcite , see also @xcite and references given therein .",
    "the aim is to obtain a global description of ground states , including collective correlations which can not be included in a mean - field approach , even at the effective interaction level , and of excited states of all nuclei in a single , unified method .",
    "an introduction to the method that we develop along these lines can be found in ref .",
    "first applications have demonstrated that such a method permits to describe the energies of low - lying collective excitations and electric transition probabilities , in - band and out - of - bands .",
    "however , in many cases it has also been found that whenever states can be grouped into rotational bands , the spectra obtained with the gcm are too spread and that the excitation energies are too high .",
    "for spherical nuclei , in particular those close to doubly - magic ones , the low - energy collective spectra are only qualitatively in agreement with the data .",
    "this feature is well illustrated by a detailed study of the quadrupole and octupole modes of nuclei around @xmath0pb in ref .",
    "@xcite : the excitation energies of the first @xmath1 and @xmath2 states are overestimated by more than 1  mev . on the other hand , the energies of giant resonances were found to be more realistic , as was also shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "the origin of this problem is not obvious and it can not be expected to be unique .",
    "a possible source of error could be the inadequacies of effective interactions to describe spectra .",
    "it is certainly an appealing feature of the projected gcm that the same effective interaction can be used to generate the mean - field states and to perform their mixing .",
    "however , existing interactions are still far from describing all nuclei with a similar high quality  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have been adjusted exclusively at the level of the mean - field approximation and on ground state properties , with at most constraints on the values of global parameters , like the effective masses or the compressibility , deduced from the systematics of excited states .",
    "there is no guarantee that such effective interactions will correctly predict spectra , although , up to now , gcm results are encouraging , and , in most cases , in good qualitative agreement with available data .",
    "another source of uncertainty of the gcm comes from the choice of the variational space in which the configuration mixing is performed .",
    "it is usually constructed by introducing constraints on one or a few collective variables related to the shape of the nuclear density in the mean - field equations .",
    "such a choice may be more appropriate to describe the properties of ground states than those of excited states , for which additional degrees of freedom might have to be included .",
    "up to now , these problems have not been addressed in a systematic way , with the exception of the detailed study of @xmath0pb and its isotopes mentioned above but which did not include the restoration of rotational symmetry . rather than to repeat the same kind of analysis as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will adopt here another strategy .",
    "we will first compare results obtained with the same effective interaction using either the gcm or the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the rpa is an alternative microscopic method to calculate collective excitations , relying also on the existence of a nuclear mean field .",
    "the rpa is very well adapted to the description of collective excitations in spherical nuclei .",
    "this will enable us to separate the problems related to the effective interactions from those related to the method .",
    "we will make this comparison for two sn isotopes , the doubly magic @xmath3sn and @xmath4sn , performing the gcm and rpa calculations under conditions as close as possible .",
    "we will see that the results differ in a manner that raises questions about the degrees of freedom that are explicitly included in the gcm",
    ". however , significant differences between both methods can not be easily eliminated and the comparison between both models can not be fully conclusive .",
    "one therefore needs a view on the problem from another perspective .",
    "exactly solvable models constitute a very fruitful ground for the test of and comparison between many - body methods .",
    "they also permit to explore new developments at a very limited cost . for this purpose , we need a model where collective variables similar to deformations can be introduced and where a discretized version of the gcm can be defined in a way similar to that of the realistic applications . the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , has the required properties .",
    "depending upon the strength of the interaction , two different kinds of solutions are obtained at the hartree - fock ( hf ) level  @xcite : `` spherical '' ones at low values of the strength , and `` deformed '' ones beyond a critical strength .",
    "the second part of the paper is devoted to a detailed discussion of the lmg model .",
    "our beyond mean - field method has already been presented in details and applied to a large number of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "let us here summarize those of its features which are essential for a critical comparison with the rpa .",
    "the starting point of the method is a set of constrained mean - field calculations , with the axial quadrupole moment as a constraining operator .",
    "the wave functions obtained for a discrete set of quadrupole moments are projected on good particle numbers and on angular momentum . for each value of the angular momentum ,",
    "the projected wave functions are mixed with respect to the quadrupole moment by the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , leading for each angular momentum to a collective wave function spread over a range of deformations .",
    "the same effective interactions , the skyrme sly4 @xcite in the mean - field ( particle - hole ) channel and a density - dependent zero - range force @xcite in the pairing ( particle - particle ) channel with a strength of @xmath5  mev  @xmath6 are used for the construction of the mean - field wave functions and for the calculation of the gcm matrix elements .",
    "the bcs subspace is limited to an energy range of 5  mev above and below the fermi level .",
    "pairing correlations are a necessary ingredient of a gcm calculation : the hartree - fock slater determinants corresponding to two deformations , for which the number of occupied single - particle states of a given symmetry is different , are orthogonal .",
    "this feature makes a gcm calculation numerically unstable .",
    "the problem is cured by the partial occupation of single - particle levels due to pairing . as bcs pairing correlations",
    "collapse whenever the density of single - particle levels around the fermi surface is low , we use the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method to ensure that pairing correlations are present for all values of the quadrupole moment .     projected energy curves as a function of the quadrupole moment for @xmath3sn . the particle - number projected mean - field deformation energy",
    "is represented by a solid line , while dotted , dashed and dash - dotted lines correspond to projected mean - field energies for , 2 , and 4 , respectively.,width=264 ]      let us first compare gcm and rpa predictions for the first excited @xmath2 state in a doubly magic nucleus , @xmath3sn , which has already been extensively studied by the rpa  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ e_sn132 ] , the mean - field energy curve is shown together with the to 4 projected energy curves as a function of the quadrupole moment . as usual , the projected states are labelled by the deformation of the mean - field state which is projected .",
    "the topography of the projected curves is typical for nuclei which have a well defined spherical mean - field ground state  @xcite .",
    "after projection , there are two nearly degenerate minima corresponding to two slightly deformed mean - field configurations , oblate and prolate .",
    "the energy gain is moderate , of the order of 2  mev , with a marginal extra gain of 210 kev due to configuration mixing .",
    "the collective gcm wave functions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ wf_sn132 ] for and 2 .    in table",
    "[ be2_132 ] , we compare the energies and @xmath7 values obtained in projected gcm and rpa calculations based on the same effective interaction  @xcite with the experimental data  @xcite . the excitation energy of the @xmath2 state is overestimated by both methods . within the rpa framework",
    ", one can show that , for sn isotopes , the inclusion of phonon couplings decreases the excitation energy of the @xmath2 state and reduces the @xmath7 transition probability , although this decrease is less pronounced in @xmath3sn than in lighter isotopes @xcite .",
    "note also that the energy centroid of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance is predicted correctly by the gcm at 12.45  mev , close to the value given by the empirical systematics @xmath8 @xmath9 mev .",
    "we have performed a similar calculation for @xmath4sn for which neutron pairing correlations are present in the ground state and for all deformations .",
    "results are compared in table  [ be2_120 ] with a rpa calculation  @xcite and with experiment  @xcite .",
    "again , we find a discrepancy between the rpa and gcm predictions for the excitation energy of the low - lying @xmath2 state , whose energy is significantly larger in the gcm calculation than in rpa .",
    "the @xmath7 value obtained within gcm is closer to the experimental value than the rpa value .",
    "this result is consistent with our findings for other systems that transition moments are in most cases much better described than excitation energies , and suggests that also for nuclei that are spherical at the mean - field level the geometrical properties of excited states are better described by the gcm than their excitation energies .",
    "this may be related to the fact that the components of the @xmath2 states corresponding to two - quasi - particle excitations breaking time reversal invariance are completely missing from the gcm model space and that these components have a larger contribution to energies than to transition probabilities .    lcc method & energy ( mev ) & b(e2@xmath10 ) + gcm & 5.69 & 630 + particle - hole rpa & 5.13 & 1370 + experiment & 4.04 & 1100@xmath11300 +    lcc method & energy ( mev ) & b(e2@xmath10 )   + gcm & 2.40 & 1350 + quasiparticle rpa & 1.44 & 440 + experiment & 1.17 & 2020@xmath1140 +     collective gcm wave functions for the ground state and the first @xmath2 state of @xmath3sn.,width=302 ]    since neither rpa nor gcm do satisfactorily reproduce the experimental energies and transition probabilities for both sn isotopes , it is tempting to conclude that the skyrme effective interaction is not fully adequate to describe low energy excitations in this mass region .",
    "besides this problem of interaction , a direct comparison between rpa and gcm results shows a discrepancy and a suspicion that the gcm variational subspace as defined in actual applications is not as rich as the rpa one , in particular , at small deformations , where two - quasi - particle excitations breaking time - reversal invariance are not included in our gcm .",
    "unfortunately , there are several differences between both calculations , which might affect their comparison , some of them being hard to eliminate .    in both cases ,",
    "the same effective interaction is used in the mean - field channel .",
    "however , since @xmath3sn is a doubly - magic nucleus , there are no pairing correlations in the spherical ground state with either a bcs or a bogoliubov treatment of pairing .",
    "therefore , there is no pairing at all in an rpa approach , in contrast to the gcm .",
    "as soon as the quadrupole deformation of the constrained mean - field state is sufficiently large ( in this case , 500 @xmath12 ) , pairing correlations are present also in the bcs method .",
    "as already mentioned above , the gcm requires generating wave functions which vary smoothly along the collective path , which is enforced using of the ln prescription ; hence , in our gcm pairing correlations are present in all states , even in the spherical mean - field configuration of @xmath3sn .",
    "another difference between the rpa calculation of @xcite and our gcm calculation is that the coulomb and the spin - orbit residual interactions are not included in the rpa , but are always present in the gcm .",
    "the effect of these terms has been very recently studied by terasaki _",
    "et al._@xcite and pru _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the coulomb residual interaction raises the @xmath2 excitation energy by 200 to 300  kev .",
    "some recent studies have also pointed out that the rpa has shortcomings which are usually forgotten . as shown by johnson and stetcu",
    ", the qrpa does not restore symmetries exactly @xcite .",
    "moreover , in some cases , the rpa predicts poorly the ground state correlation energies @xcite , the excitation energies @xcite and @xmath7 values @xcite",
    ".    still , it seems clear that the gcm overestimates excitation energies in spherical nuclei close to magicity . on the other hand ,",
    "since it looks difficult to remove all the differences between gcm and rpa calculations , the use of a model that can be exactly solved seems to be the most appropriate way to deepen the present analysis .",
    "lipkin , meshkov , and glick introduced an exactly solvable model @xcite , usually called `` lipkin model '' or `` lmg model '' in the literature , that has been widely used to test methods of approximation for the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "the model consists of @xmath13 fermions distributed in two @xmath13-fold degenerate shells separated by an energy @xmath14 . in their original paper ,",
    "two different hamiltonians were proposed .",
    "the one which is the most usually studied contains a monopole - monopole interaction and is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the interaction strength and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are quasi - spin operators @xcite @xmath19 with the algebra @xmath20 = 2 \\hat{j}_{0 } , \\qquad [ \\hat{j}_{0},\\hat{j}_{\\pm } ] = \\pm \\hat{j}_{\\pm } .\\ ] ] the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 create a particle in the upper or lower shells , respectively , where @xmath23 labels the @xmath13 degenerate levels within the shells .",
    "the operator @xmath24 measures half of the difference between the number of particles in the upper and the lower levels .",

    "as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , the interaction does not mix states which have different eigenvalues of @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the hamiltonian matrix splits into blocks , which are multiplets in @xmath31 of order @xmath32 .",
    "the multiplets separate further into blocks of size of @xmath31 and @xmath33 corresponding to the two values for the signature .    to understand the connection between the lmg model and realistic nuclear models , it is interesting to identify the structure of its eigenstates  @xcite . in the limit of vanishing interaction strength",
    ", the exact ground state corresponds to an independent particle state with all the lower single - particle levels occupied , while the exact first excited state is given by a 1p-1h excitation on top of the ground state , the second excited state by 2p-2h excitations , etc .    as the hamiltonian does not mix states which different @xmath31 values , the exact wave functions are linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath17 within a multiplet of given @xmath31 @xcite .",

    "replacing one of the mesh points by a point close to the extrema of the wave functions of the first and second excited state for @xmath55 equal to zero , the discretized gcm results become very close to the exact values for the three first states and for low interaction strengths . for the first excited state , which has a node at the origin ,",

    "the calculations are performed with 7 and 9 points in @xmath37 , and 1 or 3 points in @xmath38 . for the mesh in @xmath37",
    "we choose equidistant points in the interval ( ) . since the mesh in @xmath38 is symmetric and is always a mesh point , there is in practice one active point in @xmath38 .",
    "all discretizations give accurate results for the ground state . with a mesh in @xmath37 only , the energies of the first excited state are inaccurate , for all interaction strengths with 7 points , and below @xmath55 equal to 0.4 for a 9 point discretization .",
    "the second excited state is slightly better described although the accuracy is still limited for small interaction strengths . adding points in @xmath38 to the calculation with 7 points in @xmath37",
    "corrects the behavior near the origin and leads to very accurate results for the ground state and the second excited state .",
    "the energy of the first excited state is also improved although there still remains a small discrepancy for small interaction strengths .",

    "the dashed and dash - dotted lines correspond to gcm calculations with the same choices of points as in figure  [ e_gcm1 ] . , height=302 ]",
    "the rpa permits to determine excited states but also correlation energies in the ground state .",
    "the correlations that are given by eqn .",
    "( [ e_corpa ] ) are very accurate and makes the rpa ground state energies very close to the exact values up to interaction strength equal to 0.9 . beyond this value ,",

    "the gcm and rpa results for the excitation energies of the first two excited states are compared to the exact values in fig .",
    "[ e_excit ] .",
    "it is the accuracy of this energy difference which is the most interesting in usual applications of the gcm .",
    "the use of a mesh adjusted for an intermediate interaction strength ( ) and on the ground state gives values for the energies of the second excited state close to the exact ones when the interaction strength is large but it fails for weak interactions .",
    "the situation is even worse for the first excited state which does not have the same symmetry as the ground state . in this case , results are close to the exact ones only beyond @xmath55 equal to 0.75 , the error being as large as 60@xmath72 for @xmath55 close to zero .",
    "the results are by far better when the mesh is adapted for low-@xmath55 values , as discussed above .",
    "then , even for a small number of mesh points , the exact results for both excited states are correctly reproduced by a discretized gcm calculation .",
    "the rpa results have a very different behavior .",
    "they reproduce the exact results quite well for small interaction strengths .",
    "the first excited state becomes inaccurate above @xmath55 equal to 0.7 ; the second one deteriorates more quickly and is worse than the blind gcm discretization above @xmath55 around 0.5 .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed possible causes of the inaccuracy on energies of excited states that are predicted in gcm calculations .",
    "the study of sn isotopes has shown that part of the overestimation of excitation energies can be due to the effective interaction : rpa results obtained with the same skyrme interaction for ( @xmath3sn ) are also in disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "although it is not easy to perform fully equivalent rpa and gcm calculations , it seems clear that the gcm fails to reproduce rpa results for spherical nuclei and that at least part of the energy overestimation obtained in previous works is due to the way we use the gcm .",
    "the use of a schematic model does not allow to draw final conclusions on the origin of the problems encountered in realistic gcm applications , but it can give some hints on it . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", we have analyzed for the first time the application of the discretized gcm to the lmg model . to summarize our results",
    ", one can say first that the discretized version of the gcm works remarkably well and permits to reproduce the exact results with a very limited number of points . of course , the dimension of the lmg model is very limited but nearly exact results are obtained for the three first states using only approximately @xmath73 of the total number of independent vectors of the lmg space .",
    "a second result is that correlations in the ground state are better described than correlations in excited state .",
    "we have also seen that results are closer for the second excited state which has the same symmetry as the ground state than for the first one .",
    "the fact that an appropriate choice of a small number of discretization points permit to obtain excellent results , better than the rpa , seems to be an artefact of the lmg model , hard to transpose on realistic cases . on the other hand , it seems encouraging that the excited states are well described by the gcm when the collectivity due to the generator coordinate is large . finally , the introduction of a second generator coordinate , conjugate to the first one , also improves the gcm results and seem to make them more independent on the way the discretization is performed .",
    "how to transpose the lmg results on realistic cases is not trivial .",
    "the fact that the lmg mean - field states break all symmetries of the interaction certainly reinforces the assumption that to break more symmetries of the nuclear hamiltonian will improve the gcm description of excited states , in particular by introducing states breaking time reversal invariance .",
    "this could be done in several ways .",
    "the most sophisticate one would be to introduce collective variables conjugate to the deformation modes of the nucleus , as in the adiabatic time - dependent hf formalism of villars @xcite , goeke and reinhard @xcite , or of baranger and vnroni @xcite .",
    "a more economic way to proceed along similar lines is to introduce a few states breaking time - reversal invariance which are guessed to enlarge strongly the variational space : cranking constraint or specific two - quasi - particle excitations .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
