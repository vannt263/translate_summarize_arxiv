    "classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) are roughly solar - mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars that are accreting gas from their circumstellar disks . the extent and mass of dust in disks have been determined from ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and imaging ( see review by * ? ? ?",

    "these models predict that cttss as a group should show both co emission and absorption , while herbig ae / be stars should show co in emission .",
    "using high spectral resolution observations , @xcite showed that the co overtone emission from the probable herbig ae / be star wl 16 arises in the inner disk , confirming the prediction of @xcite .",
    "@xcite find the same result for the herbig ae / be star 1548c27 .",

    ", @xcite find that co fundamental emission near 4.6 - 4.9 @xmath8 m is common among cttss .",
    "they suggest that overtone emission has not been detected at the observed co temperatures ( 1100  1300 k ) , mainly because the overtone bands have much lower transition rates .",
    "however , co is not expected to be the dominant gas constituent in the disks around cttss , and it is the major component of the gas , h@xmath0 , that we seek to probe here .",
    "previous observations of h@xmath0 have not provided a clear picture of the gas in the disk .",

    "analysis of on - source ir h@xmath0 emission lines to date has been limited because typically only one or two lines are observed .",

    "in contrast , over 140 h@xmath0 lines from 19 different upper levels are detected in the fuv spectrum of tw hya .",
    "the excitation of h@xmath0 can be determined from relative line strengths in this rich spectrum either by measuring self - absorption in low excitation members of individual fluorescent progressions or by using an assumed ly@xmath10 profile to reconstruct initial level populations in various pumping transitions .    in this paper",

    "tw hya is one of the oldest known stars still in the ctts phase , and its mass accretion rate of about @xmath11 yr@xmath12 is lower than the mass accretion rate of most of the 12 myr old cttss that are found in taurus @xcite . from pms",

    "the twa is located at a distance of approximately 56 pc @xcite , compared with 140 pc for taurus .",
    "consequently , tw hya is by far the brightest known ctts in the uv and in x - rays .",
    "most of the uv radiation from tw hya is presumably produced at the accretion shock .",
    "the disk is viewed face - on ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which prevents signficant keplerian broadening in the h@xmath0 line profiles .",
    "the disk mass is roughly @xmath17 @xmath14 @xcite and extends more than 225 au from the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "based on estimates of the stellar mass , radius , and rotation period of tw hya , @xcite calculate that the disk at 6 @xmath18 corotates with the stellar surface . in the @xcite model , the disk is truncated at corotation .",

    "figure 1 shows a schematic model of tw hya and its disk .",
    "since the mass accretion rate of cttss can vary , we calculate the mass accretion rate at the epoch when we observed tw hya .",
    "we then proceed to estimate the extinction using absorption against  emission and the sed of the nuv continuum that is produced in an accretion shock .",
    "the observations discussed in this paper were described in paper i and are listed in table 1 .",
    "the strong excess blue and uv emission from cttss can be modelled as emission from shocks at accretion footpoints on the star , which leads to estimates of the mass accretion rate .",
    "we estimate the accretion rate of tw hya by following the method of @xcite , who modelled observed blue spectra with the sum of a photospheric template and emission from a slab of hot isothermal hydrogen to crudely simulate emission from the accretion shock .",
    "we use the hst / stis spectrum of the k7 weak - lined tts v819 tau ( see table 1 ) , spanning 11006000  , as a non - accreting template for the photospheric emission from tw hya . for v819 tau",
    "we adopt a visual extinction of @xmath19 , which is the average of values determined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then use the interstellar extinction law of @xcite to remove the effects of extinction from the observed spectrum of v819 tau .",
    "the nuv and fuv emission from v819 tau is much fainter than that of tw hya , and is not significant in this analysis .",
    "the spectrum of the model slab is determined by the slab temperature @xmath20 , density @xmath21 , thickness @xmath22 , extinction @xmath23 towards the slab , and a slab surface area parameter @xmath24 , as described in @xcite .",
    "the slab surface area parameter @xmath24 corresponds to the fraction of the stellar surface area covered by accretion - related emission , and is calculated from the scale factor applied to the slab spectrum .",
    "the scaling factor between the non - accreting template star and tw hya is another free parameter .",
    "we find the best - fit model parameters by fitting the synthetic slab spectrum plus the scaled template spectrum to the nuv and optical spectrum of tw hya , minimizing @xmath25 using the _ amoeba _ function in idl , which is based on the downhill simplex minimization method .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the slab are @xmath26 , @xmath27 k , @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 km , @xmath31 , and a template scaling factor of 1.18 .    figure 2 shows our fit to the optical spectrum of tw hya , after subtracting the scaled template spectrum of v819 tau .",
    "the accretion continuum calculated in this model is consistent with the observed nuv continuum .",
    "however , the observed continuum flux rises shortward of 1700  , which could result from ( i ) an h@xmath0 dissociation continuum produced by electron collisions @xcite , ( ii ) h@xmath0 fluorescence pumped by the fuv continuum , or ( iii ) by a hot accretion or activity component .",
    "the sed of the fuv continuum is similar to the continuum observed in hh2 , which is probably produced by h@xmath0 dissociation @xcite .",
    "however , the fuv continuum of tw hya appears smooth and does not show strong h@xmath0 emission lines at 1054   and 1101  , which are detected towards hh2 .",
    "assuming that half of the potential energy of the accreting gas is converted into hydrogen continuum emission@xmath32 , then the mass accretion rate of tw hya can be estimated by @xmath33 where @xmath34 erg @xmath35 s@xmath12 is the slab flux integrated over all wavelengths .",
    "the leading factor of 1.25 , derived by @xcite for a magnetospheric accretion geometry , replaces the factor of 2 from a spherical accretion geometry .",
    "we adopt @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the mass and radius of tw hya @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the stellar mass , radius , and distance are all of order 20% .",
    "we calculate an accretion rate onto the star of @xmath38 @xmath14 yr@xmath12 , which is consistent with the accretion rate of @xmath39 @xmath14 yr@xmath12 estimated by @xcite using a similar method , and is larger than the accretion rate of @xmath40 @xmath14 yr@xmath12 estimated by @xcite using an analysis of the h@xmath10 line .      in this section",
    ", we argue that the extinction to tw hya is negligible by measuring the hydrogen column density directly from the shape of the observed  line , and then using an ism extinction law to infer the dust extinction . this argument does not necessarily imply that the extinction towards the warm h@xmath0 is negligible , because some dust could be mixed with the warm h@xmath0 , leading to extinction of h@xmath0 fluxes without any extinction of the stellar or accretion emission .",
    "we will discuss this possibility in  5 .",
    "figure 3 shows the observed  profile , which is likely produced in an accretion column , contains a dark , broad absorption feature that extends from + 200  to -500 .",
    "the absorption is produced by in the wind and in interstellar and circumstellar material . because circumstellar and interstellar absorption are indistinguishable in our data , we model these two features with a single absorption feature .",
    "all uv spectra of cttss show similar wind absorption in mg ii @xcite , so the star must be occulted by the outflow , regardless of inclination angle .    in the following analysis ,",
    "we fit two gaussian emission profiles and either one or two voigt absorption profiles to the observed  profile .",
    "the intrinsic emission profile is assumed to be a double - gaussian profile , and the parameters of the gaussians are allowed to vary to best fit the observed profile when combined with the absorption .",
    "based on the widely separated wind and interstellar absorption features observed in the  1302   ,  1334   , and  2795    lines , the interstellar and wind absorption components towards tw hya must be centered at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . for the interstellar component",
    "we assume a doppler parameter of @xmath43 , which corresponds to a temperature of 7000  k that is typical of the local ( warm ) ism @xcite . an interstellar column density",
    "is then determined by fitting the absorption longward of line center , where any wind absorption should be negligible .",
    "the wind absorption extends to a velocity of at least -500 , and likely has a large doppler parameter due to velocity gradients along our line of sight .",
    "given these assumptions , the interstellar neutral hydrogen column density in our line of sight is @xmath1@xmath44 ( fig .",
    "the upper limit of the column density in the wind is @xmath45@xmath46 for doppler parameters @xmath47    in a more conservative test to find the upper limit to the hydrogen column density , we fit the  absorption with a single component , effectively combining any interstellar and wind absorption .",
    "we vary the central wavelength of the absorption and set a low doppler parameter parameter , so that the damping wings generate the width of the absorption profile .",
    "figure 4 shows that the maximum possible column density consistent with the data is @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "the conservative upper limit of the hydrogen column density towards tw hya is therefore @xmath48h@xmath50 .",
    "in the only previous measurement of @xmath51 ( ) to tw hya , @xcite used x - ray spectral energy distributions from _ rosat _ and _ asca _ to estimate higher column densities of @xmath48@xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "however , the x - ray analyses are highly reliant on the accuracy of plasma codes .",
    "@xcite estimate the hydrogen column density by assuming solar abundances and using a two - temperature emission measure rather than a differential emission measure distribution",
    ". however , in their analysis of the _ chandra _ x - ray spectrum of tw hya , @xcite found that the abundances show an inverse - fip effect .",
    "we further note that the sensitivity and flux calibration of _ rosat _ and _ asca _ are relatively poor at soft energies , where absorption from ionization is measured .",
    "figure 4 shows that the absorption calculated for the  line for @xmath48@xmath54 is signficantly broader than the observed absorption profile .",
    "our comparison of the calculated transmission function with the observed  profile provides a much simpler and more direct test of hydrogen column density than the x - ray analyses .",
    "the discrepancy between the uv and x - ray measurements of n(h ) could in principle be due to a variable circumstellar absorber , which @xcite invoked to explain the order of magnitude discrepancy in calculations of n(h ) from _ asca _ and _ rosat_. however , the many ultraviolet observations of tw hya by _ iue _ , _ hst_/stis , and _ fuse _ , which are widely spaced in time , show no evidence for large fluctuations in extinction .",
    "we estimate an h@xmath0 column density in our line of sight to tw hya with _ fuse _ , as the bandpass contains many h@xmath0 transitions from low rotational levels of the ground electronic state , which are often seen in absorption due to the ism at temperatures typically @xmath55 k @xcite . h@xmath0 absorption lines from @xmath56 can in principle be observed against o vi emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the profiles are noisy ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , but we estimate an upper limit of @xmath48h@xmath57 by calculating the transmission percentage for a range of temperatures and column densities , meaning the molecular fraction of h towards tw hya is very low .",
    "when we convert total hydrogen column density , @xmath51()+@xmath58h@xmath59h ) , to a reddening using the interstellar relationship of @xcite , @xmath60 we find that the reddening toward tw hya is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a dimensionless parameter that ranges between 2.56 , depending on the size distribution of dust grains .",
    "significant deviations from the assumed dust - to - gas ratio can occur in star - forming regions such as @xmath63 oph , in which the dust grains are likely larger than they are in the ism .",
    "however , the low molecular fraction towards tw hya is consistent with a low extinction @xcite , and is not consistent with material found towards star - forming regions .",
    "we conclude that this relationship provides a reasonable estimate of the extinction along our sightline to tw hya .",
    "even if the dust - to - gas ratio along the line of sight to tw hya were for some reason enhanced by an order of magnitude , then dust extinction would reduce the brightness of tw hya by a factor of 2 and have only a 20% effect on the relative fluxes between 1200   and 1650  .",
    "inspection of the nuv continuum ( fig .",
    "6 ) confirms the small extinction to tw hya .",
    "if we assume that the nuv continuum is produced in an isothermal slab , as modelled in  2.1 , then it can be well fitted with a hydrogen continuum only for extinctions @xmath64 . as noted in  2.1 , an accretion continuum best fits the nuv continuum for @xmath26 .",
    "in paper i , we measured a total line emission flux of @xmath65 erg s@xmath12 @xmath35 by summing 146 h@xmath0 emission lines in the 19 progressions ( the set of _ r _ and _ p _ transitions from a common upper level ) listed in table 2 .",

    "@xcite discovered in their analysis of _",
    "hst_/stis  observations of mira b that h@xmath0 fluxes weaken towards short wavelengths because of increasing h@xmath0 line opacities .",
    "this occurs because shorter wavelength lines are transitions to low energy levels , which are more populated than higher levels .",
    "figure 7 demonstrates that the same effect occurs in the h@xmath0 fluorescence sequences detected towards tw hya . in most sequences , fluxes in many h@xmath0 emission lines at short wavelengths",
    "are weaker than predicted from theoretical branching ratios because of significant absorption in the same transitions .",
    "transitions from levels with low excitation energies , such as = 0 , = 1 , have significant optical depth below 1300   , but this does not happen for transitions from levels with large excitation energies such as = 4 , = 18 ( see fig .",

    "we compute h@xmath0 opacities by modelling h@xmath0 fluorescence in a 1d isothermal plane - parallel atmosphere of h@xmath0 irradiated by  photons .",
    "we assume complete frequency and angular redistribution when photons scatter in the slab .",
    "forty - one wavelength grid points across each h@xmath0 line profile track differences in escape probability across the line profile because because a photon that scatters into the wings of a line escapes from a slab more easily than a photon at line center .",

    "quickly de - excites to the ground electronic state through one of the many available routes , or dissociates with a probability @xmath67 [ listed in table 2 , calculated by @xcite ] .",
    "depending on the optical depth of h@xmath0 in the lower level of the downward transition , the resulting photon may be temporarily absorbed by another h@xmath0 molecule or may emerge from either side of the slab at an angle @xmath68 with respect to the normal . in our simple model ,",
    "h@xmath0 line photons created fluorescently in the slab either escape , are converted to another h@xmath0 line in the same progression , or dissociate an h@xmath0 molecule .",

    "in  3 and  4 , we described in detail results for a dust - free thick disk geometry , which may not represent the true morphology of warm gas around the star . in this section",
    ", we explore the same parameter space for a thin disk geometry , shown schematically in figure 8 , and a cloud geometry , which approximates h@xmath0 emission from a cloud in our line of sight to the star .",
    "the computed h@xmath0 fluxes depend on the angle at which  photons enter the disk , the exit angle of h@xmath0 photons , and the extinction either within the disk or in the ism .",

    "the calculated column density of h@xmath0 and its physical interpretation , however , do depend on the assumed geometry . in what follows ,",
    "the column density represents the amount of h@xmath0 in a line of sight normal to the disk surface , regardless of the path length the photons traverse through the disk .      a thin disk ( see fig .",
    "8) is characterized here as a disk for which the filling factor of h@xmath0 around the  source is dominated by the surface layers of the disk , rather than by the inner edge of the disk .",
    "we approximate this geometry with a model in which the incident photons enter a plane - parallel slab at a large angle with respect to the disk normal and are reprocessed into h@xmath0 photons that emerge normal to the slab . because   photons enter the slab at a large angle , the radiation is reprocessed into h@xmath0 emission at a shallow depth , and the emerging h@xmath0 photons see a smaller optical depth in this geometry than in the thick disk geometry .",
    "for the thin disk geometry , with incident photons entering the disk at @xmath115 , the best - fit parameters are @xmath79 k , @xmath45h@xmath0)=20.0 , but with an unacceptable @xmath116 , for fits to h@xmath0 line fluxes . for fits of the reconstructed to the observed  line , the confidence contours move to smaller column densities by a factor of @xmath117 .",
    "as the angle of incidence asymptotically approaches 90@xmath118 , the  photons are converted into h@xmath0 photons close to the disk surface .",
    "since the optical depth traversed by the emitted h@xmath0 photons is negligible , the relative line fluxes with each progression differ from predicted branching ratios only because of extinction , which we find to be unlikely ( see  2.2 and  5.3 ) .",
    "we next consider a geometry in which the h@xmath0 is located between us and the source of  photons . in this geometry",
    ", the escaping photons must travel through a greater optical depth of h@xmath0 than they would in the other geometries that we considered . as a result , the acceptable contours for fits to h@xmath0 line fluxes move towards smaller column densities relative to the thick or thin disk geometries . even in this very different geometry ,",
    "the confidence contours for the  reconstruction fitting do not move much in parameter space , and they restrict the gas temperature to 20003000  k. the best - fit parameters in fitting h@xmath0 fluxes for this geometry are @xmath78 k , @xmath45h@xmath0)=17.8 , with @xmath119 . the transmission geometry is probably not realistic for tw hya , but it can be used to set limits on the column of warm h@xmath0 between us and the source of  emission .",
    "the absence of any observed h@xmath0 absorption in the  profile ( fig .",
    "3 ) allows us to place a limit on the column density in this level of @xmath120 and a total column density of warm h@xmath0 of @xmath48h@xmath121 .",
    "thus , the detected h@xmath0 fluorescence does not occur in our line of sight to tw hya .      in  2",
    ", we presented evidence that the dust extinction along our line of sight to the  emission source is negligible .",
    "extinction of h@xmath0 emission could occur within the disk if dust is mixed with the warm gas , although @xcite found that small dust grains are underabundant within 5 au of the star .",
    "we assume an interstellar extinction law from @xcite , for grains typical of the interstellar medium ( @xmath122 ) .    for each h@xmath0 progression , the average depth @xmath123 of the initial absorption depends on the opacity of the lower level of h@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "17 and table 2 ) . if a  photon is , on average , absorbed close to the disk surface , then the h@xmath0 lines excited by that photon will not be significantly attenuated by any disk extinction .",
    "thus , the extinction varies for the different progressions . in figure 16",
    ", @xmath23 represents the extinction through half of the slab ( not the extinction through the entire slab or the extinction from the star to the observer ) , which is equal to the largest possible average extinction of h@xmath0 emission when  photons are absorbed uniformly throughout the slab .",
    "disk extinction attenuates both the incident  emission and the outgoing h@xmath0 emission , but not the observed  emission , and thus increases the already large filling factor . in the context of our model , significant disk extinction can be ruled out because the computed filling factors would be much larger than unity .",
    "interstellar extinction affects the fluxes smoothly across the wavelength region , and does not significantly impact the derived filling factor because it attenuates both the observed  emission and the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "if we consider only extinction and ignore opacity in the h@xmath0 lines , then from fitting h@xmath0 line fluxes we obtain a minimum @xmath124 at @xmath23=1.3 , which is significantly larger than the @xmath125 for the best - fitting models .      based on these results , and the results presented in figs",
    "15 - 16 and table 5 , we adopt the thick disk geometry ( geometry 2 in table 5 ) as the preferred geometry to describe the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the thick disk geometry is physically plausible and produces reasonably good fits with self - consistent results , although certain other geometries can produce lower values of @xmath25 in fits to h@xmath0 fluxes or in the  fits .",
    "some of those geometries ( e.g. , geomteries 7 and 8 from table 5 ) represent morphologies that are difficult to reconcile with our previous conclusion that the h@xmath0 emission occurs in a disk . in other geometries ( e.g. , geometries 1 and 11 from table 5 )",
    ", contours from the h@xmath0 flux fitting do not overlap with the contours from the  fitting as well as they do for the thick disk geometry , i.e. the joint probability is lower ( see fig . 11 ) .",
    "we caution the reader that the thick disk geometry is best only in the context of our restricted set of models .",
    "warm h@xmath0 in the tw hya star - disk system could in principle have a morphology not considered here .",
    "figures 11 and 13 , and table 5 , compare results from our analysis of individual h@xmath0 line fluxes with our results from the  profile reconstruction . based on the overlap region of acceptable models for both the individual h@xmath0 line fluxes and the reconstructed  profile , we conclude that a column density of @xmath48h@xmath2 is heated to a temperature of @xmath126  k , with a filling factor of @xmath127 around tw hya ( @xmath128 error bars ) . table 2 lists the percentage @xmath96 of h@xmath0 that dissociates from the upper level , the h@xmath0 dissociation rate in terms of mass ( @xmath129 ) , and the total flux for each progression ( @xmath130 ) for our best - fit model of @xmath48h@xmath81 and @xmath79  k. the notion of a single temperature is a simplistic assumption , but it is sufficient to reproduce our data .",
    "the temperature derived here is warmer than the @xmath131 k temperatures seen in the fundamental co emission by @xcite .    the mass column corresponding to @xmath48h@xmath0)=18.5 is @xmath132 g @xmath35 , which is about @xmath133 times smaller than the mass column predicted to be within 1 au by @xcite",
    "this suggests that h@xmath0 fluorescence probably occurs in a very shallow surface layer of the disk , which could be a warm , extended disk atmosphere .",
    "the  fluorescence process can not be used to detect cold h@xmath0 , which most likely represents the bulk of the mass in the disk .    in our models",
    ", we assume that h@xmath0 gas is thermalized , so that relative level populations depend only on temperature .",
    "this is reasonable because the gas density at the disk surface should be between @xmath134  @xmath29 @xcite , which is far larger than the critical density of @xmath135=@xmath136  @xmath29 at which collisions typically dominate over quadrupole radiative de - excitation . below the critical density , collisions can not repopulate excited h@xmath0 levels as fast as they radiatively deexcite .",

    "this conclusion confirms the assumption of thermally excited h@xmath0 gas used by @xcite and @xcite to model h@xmath0 fluorescence .",
    "figure 13 shows that the filling factor of the h@xmath0 around the  emitting region is @xmath127 .",
    "this factor represents the solid angle of the sky subtended by h@xmath0 as seen from the source of  photons near tw hya , although other geometrical effects may contribute .",
