    "instabilities caused by differential rotation of a magnetized gas may play an important role in enhancing transport processes in various astrophysical bodies and laboratory experiments .",
    "it is well known since the classical papers by velikhov @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite that a differentially rotating flow with a negative angular velocity gradient and a weak magnetic field is unstable to the magnetorotational instability .",
    "this instability has been analyzed in detail in the astrophysical context ( see @xcite ) because it can be responsible for transport of the angular momentum in various objects ranging from accretion disks to galaxies . in accretion disks ,",
    "this instability is also well studied by numerical simulations in both linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "simulations of this instability in accretion disks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) show that the generated turbulence can enhance substantially the angular momentum transport .",
    "astrophysical applications of the magnetorotational instability rise great interest in trying to study this instability in laboratory @xcite .",
    "the experiments , however , are complicated because very large rotation rates should be achieved .",
    "recently , hollerbach and rdiger @xcite argued that the rotation rate can be substantially decreased adding an azimuthal field .",
    "it is known since the paper by tayler @xcite that an azimuthal field produce a strong destabilizing effect and , as a result of this additional destabilization , the critical reynolds number in experiment can be reduced .    on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetorotational instability is not the only instability that operates in differentially rotating magnetized flows .",
    "for example , even a weak axial dependence of the angular velocity can result in a double diffusive instability that is often called the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that many previous stability analyses have adopted the boussinesq approximation , and have therefore neglected the effect of compressibility .",
    "this is allowed if the magnetic field strength is essentially subthermal , and the sound speed is much greater than the alfvn velocity , @xmath8 but often this can not be realized in real astrophysical conditions and in many numerical simulations .",
    "an attempt to consider the effect of compressibility on the magnetorotational instability was undertaken by blaes and balbus @xcite in the context of astrophysical disks .",
    "the authors considered a very simplified case of the wavevector parallel to the rotation axis and a vanishing radial magnetic field . as a result",
    ", the most interesting physics has been lost in this study since only the standard magnetorotational instability operates in this simple geometry .    in this paper , we show that a new instability different from the standard magnetorotational instability may occur in a compressible differentially rotating magnetized flow .",
    "this instability appears for any differential rotation and may occurs if the magnetic field has non - vanishing radial and azimuthal components .",
    "the instability can arise even in a sufficiently strong magnetic field that suppresses the magnetorotational instability .",
    "stability analysis done in this paper will hopefully prove to be a useful guide understand various numerical simulations that explore the nonlinear development of instabilities and their effects on the resulting turbulent state of rotating magnetized flows .",
    "we work in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath4 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) with the unit vectors ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the equations of compressible mhd read @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 our notation is as follows : @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the density and fluid velocity , respectively ; @xmath21 is the gas pressure ; @xmath22 is gravity that can be important in astrophysical applications ; @xmath23 is the magnetic field , @xmath24 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath25 is the adiabatic index . for the sake of simplicity , the flow is assumed to be isothermal .",
    "the basic state on which the stability analysis is performed is assumed to be quasi - stationary with the angular velocity @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "generally , a quasi - stationary basic state can not be achieved for any differentially rotating magnetic configuration , therefore we discuss in more detail when this assumption can be satisfied .",
    "we assume that gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the basic state , then @xmath28 generally , a geometry of the magnetic field can be rather complex , and our study is primerily addressed such complex magnetic configurations where the radial and azimuthal field components are presented .",
    "the presence of a radial magnetic field and differential rotation in the basic state can lead to the development of the azimuthal field .",
    "nevertheless , the basic state can be considered in some cases as quasi - stationary despite the development of the toroidal field .",
    "for example , if the magnetic reynolds number is large ( @xmath24 is small ) , then one can obtain from eq .",
    "( 4 ) that the azimuthal field grows approximately linearly with time , @xmath29 where @xmath3 , and @xmath30 is the azimuthal field at @xmath31 . as long as the second term on the r.h.s . is small compared to the first one , and @xmath32 stretching of the azimuthal field does not affect significantly the basic state ; @xmath33 is the characteristic timescale of generation of @xmath2 . as a result",
    ", the basic state can be treated as quasi - stationary during the time @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath35 , then steady - state can be maintained during a relatively long time before the generated azimuthal field begins to influence the basic state .",
    "we will show that the growth time of instability can be shorter than @xmath33 in many cases of interest .",
    "if the magnetic reynolds number is moderate , then stretching of the azimuthal field from @xmath1 by differential rotation can be compensated by ohmic dissipation , and the basic state can be quasi - stationary as well . then , we have from eq .",
    "( 4 ) the following condition of steady - state @xmath36_{\\varphi } = \\eta [ \\nabla \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\vec{b})]_{\\varphi},\\ ] ] or @xmath37 the generated toroidal field is typicaly stronger than the radial field by a factor of the order of the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "this simple model applies only in the case of moderate reynolds number since the generation of a very strong toroidal field could lead to instabilities of the basic state caused , for example , by magnetic buoyancy or reconnection . note that a quasi - stationary basic state with non - vanishing radial and azimuthal field components can be achieved in other models as well .",
    "for example , if the angular velocity depends on both the @xmath4- and @xmath10-coordinates , then changes in @xmath2 caused by stretching from the radial and vertical field components due to radial and verical shear , respectively , can balance each other in such a way that @xmath2 will be steady - state .",
    "in fact , there is no principle difference for instability which mechanism is responsible for maintaining a quasi - stationary basic configuration .",
    "the only important point for our model is the pesence of the magnetic field with non - vanishing radial and azimuthal components , but such magnetic configurations are rather common in astrophysics ( galactic and accretion disks , stellar radiative zones , oceans of accreting neutron stars , etc . )",
    "we consider the stability of axisymmetric short wavelength perturbations with the spacetime dependence @xmath38 .",
    "where @xmath39 is the wavevector , @xmath40 .",
    "small perturbations will be indicated by subscript 1 , while unperturbed quantities will have no subscript .",
    "then , to the lowest order in @xmath41 the linearized mhd - equations read @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 we neglect ohmic dissipation in the induction equation because the inverse ohmic decay timescale is small for many cases of interest in astrophysics .",
    "generally , the dispersion relation for eqs.(11)-(15 ) is rather complicated and , in this paper , we consider only a particular case when the wavevector of perturbations is perpendicular to @xmath23 , @xmath47 .",
    "this case , being mathematically much simpler , illustrates very well the main qualitative features of the new magnetic shear - driven instability . besides",
    ", the standard magnetorotational instability does not operate in this case because its growth rate is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the difference between instabilities is seen most clearly if @xmath49 .    in the case",
    "@xmath49 , eqs .",
    "( 11)-(15 ) may be combined after some algebra into a fifth - order dispersion relation , @xmath50 where we denote @xmath51 this equation describes five non - trivial modes that exist in a rotating magnetized flow if @xmath52 .    in the non - magnetic case , @xmath53 , eq .  ( 16 ) yields @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the frequency of sound waves .",
    "the solution is @xmath56 instability arises only if the well - known rayleigh criterion is fulfilled , @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", the inertial mode is unstable which corresponds to the upper sign .",
    "the sound mode that corresponds to the lower sign is always stable .",
    "to have an idea about the properties of dispersion equation ( 16 ) , we can consider a particular case of flow with @xmath58 .",
    "then , @xmath59 and we have from eq .",
    "( 16 ) @xmath60 the solutions of this equation are @xmath61 where @xmath62 at least , one of the roots has a positive real part ( instability ) if @xmath63 .",
    "the latter condition is equivalent @xmath64 that is the criterion of instability in this simple case .",
    "it is clear from this simple example that the quantity @xmath65 plays a crucial role for stability of magnetized compressible flows .",
    "the conditions under which eq .  ( 16 ) has unstable solutions can be obtained by making use of the routh - hurwitz theorem ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of the dispersion equation of a fifth order , the routh - hurwitz criteria are written , for example , in @xcite . according to these criteria , eq .",
    "( 16 ) has unstable solutions if one of the following inequalities is fulfilled @xmath66 these inequalities yield the criterion of instability @xmath67 apart from differential rotation , this criterion requires non - vanishing radial and azimuthal field components .",
    "the vertical component of @xmath23 is unimportant for criterion ( 23 ) , and the instability may occur even in a plane parallel magnetic field with components only in radius and azimuth .",
    "the direction of @xmath23 and the sign of @xmath6 are insignificant , and the instability may occur for both the inward and outward decreasing angular velocity .",
    "note that this is in contrast with the magnetorotational instability that can arise only if @xmath68 .",
    "another important difference is that the magnetorotational instability is suppressed by a sufficiently strong field , whereas the instability given by eq .  (",
    "23 ) can arise even in a very strong field .    to calculate the growth rate in the general case it is convenient to introduce dimensionless quantities @xmath69 ( we assume that @xmath70 ) .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 do not depend on the wavevector .",
    "then , eq .  ( 16 ) becomes @xmath73 this equation was solved numerically for different @xmath74 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 by computing the eigenvalues of the matrix whose characteristic polynomial is given by eq .",
    "( 16 ) ( see @xcite , for details ) .    in fig .  1",
    ", we plot the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath75 on @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the solid lines show the growth rate and frequency for complex conjugate roots , and the dashed line for a real root .",
    "as mentioned , there should be no instability in the incompressible limit because all the considered perturbations are stable with respect to the standard magnetorotational instability .",
    "our calculations , however , clearly indicate that some roots have a positive real part and , hence , there should exist a new shear - driven instability in the compressible flow with @xmath80 .",
    "there are two pairs of unstable complex conjugate roots and one real stable root with negative re @xmath75 . in the considered domain of parameters , i m",
    "@xmath75 for complex roots is typically @xmath81 times greater than re @xmath75 except the region of not very large @xmath82 where they are of the same order of magnitude ( but still i m @xmath83 re @xmath75 ) .",
    "one pair of unstable roots has a very small growth rate @xmath84 , but another one grows much faster .",
    "for these roots , the growth rate is @xmath85 and varies very slowly with the wavelength of perturbations .",
    "note that calculations for other values of the parameters show that typically re @xmath86 if @xmath87 , but re @xmath75 becomes smaller if @xmath88 .",
    "this is qualitatively clear because the case @xmath88 corresponds to the incompressible limit when the considered instability is substantially suppressed .    in fig .  2",
    ", we plot the dependence of re @xmath75 on @xmath76 for the case @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we do not plot i m @xmath75 because this dependence does not differ much from what is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the change of sign alters qualitatively the behavior of roots .",
    "if @xmath72 is negative then all oscillatory modes are stable ( re @xmath92 ) but the real mode becomes unstable .",
    "this conclusion is completely consistent with our analytical consideration of eq .",
    "it is worth mentioning that calculations for other @xmath74 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 also indicate that this sort of behavior is rather general , and the non - oscillatory mode is typically unstable for negative @xmath72 whereas the oscillatory modes are unstable for positive @xmath72 . like the previous case ,",
    "the growth rate weakly depends on the wavelength except the region @xmath93 where this dependence is stronger .",
    "the characteristic value of the growth rate is larger for negative @xmath72 and reaches @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "note that this is typical also for other values of @xmath74 and @xmath71 and that a non - oscillatory mode ( negative @xmath72 ) grows faster than oscillatory modes ( positive @xmath72 ) for the same @xmath96 .",
    "on @xmath97 for @xmath77 , @xmath98 , and @xmath79 .",
    "solids lines show the growth rate and frequency of complex roots , and the dashed line corresponds to the real root.,width=340 ]     for @xmath89 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to complex and real roots , respectively.,width=340 ]    fig .",
    "3 illustrates the behavior of roots as functions of the parameter @xmath72 for fixed value of @xmath76 .",
    "it is seen that re @xmath75 vanishes for both oscillatory and non - oscillatory modes when @xmath72 goes to zero . since @xmath100",
    ", the instability occurs only if @xmath101 in complete agreement with the criterion ( 13 ) . as usual ,",
    "the real root is positive ( instability ) at @xmath102 whereas the oscillatory roots have positive real parts at @xmath103 .",
    "for the same @xmath96 , the growth rate is larger for negative @xmath72 .",
    "on @xmath104 for @xmath89 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to complex and real roots , respectively.,width=340 ]",
    "to summarize then , we have considered the instability caused by differential rotation of compressible magnetized gas . to illustrate the main qualitative features of the instability associated to compressibility and shear",
    ", we analyzed a particular case of perturbations with the wavevector @xmath107 perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath23 . in this case , the standard magnetorotational instability , well - studied in incompressible fluids ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , does not occur because its growth rate is proportional to @xmath108 .",
    "nevertheless , even perturbations with @xmath52 turn out to be instable if the necessary condition of the new instability , @xmath109 , is satisfied .    in our stability analysis",
    ", we assume that the basic state is quasi - stationary .",
    "this assumption can be fulfilled in many cases of astrophysical interest despite the development of the azimuthal field from the radial one due to differential rotation .",
    "for instance , if the magnetic reynolds number is large then the timescale of generation of the toroidal field is @xmath110 if @xmath111 .",
    "instability can be considered in a quasi - stationary approximation if its growth time is shorter than @xmath33 . as it is seen from eq .",
    "( 21 ) , the growth rate of instability in the case of a strong compressibility can be roughly estimated as @xmath65 .",
    "then , the condition of quasi - stationarity reads @xmath112 , or @xmath113 since the l.h.s . of this equation",
    "is proportional to @xmath114 but the r.h.s .",
    "does not depend on @xmath114 , there always exists the range of @xmath114 for which eq .",
    "( 26 ) can be satisfied and the basic state is quasi - stationary .",
    "the considered instability is related basically to shear and compressibility of a magnetized gas . in the incompressible limit that corresponds to @xmath115 or @xmath116",
    ", we have from eq .  ( 16 ) @xmath117 and the instability disappears .",
    "this is a principle difference to other well - known instabilities caused by differential rotation such as the rayleigh or magnetorotational instabilities .",
    "note that an attempt to consider instability associated to compressibility of differentially rotating magnetized gas has been undertaken by blaes & balbus @xcite .",
    "these authors , however , analyzed only the unperturbed configuration where the magnetic field has vertical or azimuthal components , but such configurations are stable in accordance to our criterion ( 23 ) .",
    "the properties of the considered instability are very much different from those of other instabilities which can occur in cylindrical magnetized flows .",
    "the necessary condition of the new instability ( 23 ) can be satisfied for both outward increasing and decreasing @xmath118 , whereas the magnetorotational instability occurs only if @xmath118 decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "the found instability operates only if the basic magnetic configuration is relatively complex with non - vanishing radial and azimuthal field components while the standard magnetorotational instability can arise also if both these components are vanishing and only @xmath119",
    ".    this new instability can be either oscillatory or non - oscillatory , depending on the sign of @xmath72 , whereas the standard magnetorotational instability is always non - oscillatory . typically , the considered instability is non - oscillatory if @xmath102 and oscillatory if @xmath120 .",
    "one more important difference is associated with the dependence on the magnetic field strength . a sufficiently strong magnetic field",
    ", satisfying the inequality @xmath121 , completely suppresses the standard magnetorotational instability . on the contrary",
    ", the instability discovered in our study can not be suppressed even in very strong magnetic fields as it is seen from the criterion ( 23 ) .",
    "all this comparison allows us to claim that our analysis demonstrates the presence of the new instability in compressible cylindrical flow",
    ".    the growth rate of the newly found instability can be rather large and reach @xmath122 . basically , the growth rate is larger for non - oscillatory modes which are unstable if @xmath123 .",
    "the growth rate depends on compressibility , being smaller for a low compressibility .",
    "the incompressible limit ( boussinesq approximation ) corresponds to @xmath8 , and the considered instability is inefficient in this limit because of a low growth rate .",
    "however , in the case of a strong field with @xmath124 when the boussinesq approximation does not apply , the instability can be much more efficient than the magnetorotational instability .",
