    "in the study of the two - dimensional quantum field theories and statistical models , the conformal field theories ( cft ) @xcite have provided both theoretical frameworks and powerful tools .",
    "this applies to off - critical models , not to mention critical ones .",
    "various off - critical quantities can be related to those of cfts .",
    "the two - body scattering amplitude ( @xmath4-matrix ) of a perturbed cft @xcite can reproduce the central charge and identify the perturbing field using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite and provide a proof that most integrable quantum field theories are cfts perturbed by some relevant operator along which the theory extends away from criticality .",
    "two - dimensional lattice models with boltzmann weights satisyfing the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) also show these properties .",
    "for example , the order parameters such as local height probabilities ( lhp ) of the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models can generate critical exponents like the central charges of minimal cfts @xcite and are related to the characters of the cfts @xcite .",
    "such relations between critical and off - critical theories in the presence of boundary are main question investigated in this paper .",
    "there have been many interesting progresses in the quantum field theory in the space - time with boundary . in paricular ,",
    "existence of the boundary in @xmath5 dimensions changes conserved quantities , symmetries and integrability and requires new formulations for both cfts and integrable off - critical models . to maintain infinite dimensional conformal symmetries",
    ", the cfts should introduce new quantities , the conformal boundary states , which have one - to - one correspondence with conformal boundary conditions ( cbc ) @xcite .",
    "off - critical models which can be represented by a symbolic action @xmath6 can maintain the integrability if one choose the perturbing fields carefully .",
    "for example , it is shown in @xcite that the minimal cfts perturbed by the least relevant bulk and boundary primary fields can be integrable .",
    "once the integrability is implemented , we need new quantities called the boundary reflection amplitudes ( @xmath7-matrices ) which are the probability amplitudes for a particle to scatter off from the boundary .",
    "the boundary ybe and bootstrap arguments can determine these amplitudes completley with a given @xmath4-matrix , the bulk scattering amplitude , as an input @xcite .",
    "as the bulk tba based on the @xmath4-matrix give the cft data underlying in the perturbed cfts such as central charges , the @xmath7-matrix can be used to find the information on the boundary conditions .",
    "this is our main question investigated in this paper .",
    "tba analysis with the boundary should be a natural method for this purpose .",
    "recently , tba for the perturbed minimal cfts with certain bcs has been used to find the boundary entropies and corresponding cbcs @xcite . with certain @xmath7-matrices ,",
    "the cbcs flow into each other which are consistent with independent study based on the roaming tba @xcite .",
    "this result seems very interesting since it can provide a general method to understand the relations of the @xmath7-matrix and cfts data in ( [ pbcft ] ) . in this paper , we generalize this result on the minimal models to general coset cfts @xcite which include the superconformal series and @xmath8 parafermionic algebras @xcite .",
    "the minimal cfts are only the first of many infinite series of these cfts .",
    "one can obtain a variety of off - critical integrable models associated with these cfts which include many interesting ones .",
    "these questions are not merely of academic interests .",
    "they can be directly related to physical quantities measurable in experiment .",
    "recent progress have shown that these theoretical tools can be very efficient for quantitative understanding of non - perturbative aspects of boundary problems .",
    "for example , boundary cfts @xcite have been applied to multi - channel kondo models @xcite and integrable field theories to transport phenomena in quantum impurity problems @xcite .",
    "the boundary entropies associated with cbcs are one of main physical quantities in these computations at uv and ir fixed points .",
    "our methods for the general coset theories with certain limits are used to understand the flows between the cbcs quantitatively .",
    "our results will be of use to estabilish the boundary tba method to compute the boundary entropy and to understand boundary behaviours in the intermediate boundary scale for a wide class of integrable models including the multi - channel kondo model .",
    "this paper is orgarnized as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we define the general cfts and associated lattice models .",
    "we derive the boundary entropies for the cbcs of these cfts following standard procedure .",
    "the boundary perturbations of these cfts are understood in terms of massless scattering matrices in sect.3 .",
    "these @xmath4-matrices are used to compute the boundary entropies using the tba . in sect.4 , we compute the flows of the boundary entropies using an independent analysis , namely , boundary roaming tba . the boundary roaming tba of super cfts are obtained by analytic continuation of that of the supersymmetric sinh - gordon ( sshg ) model . similar analysis is proposed for the parafermionic models .",
    "numerical analysis shows that the results are consistent with those obtained from the boundary cfts and rsos tba .",
    "we conclude with some discussions in sect.5 .",
