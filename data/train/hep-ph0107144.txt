    "detailed studies of the top quark are among the major projects of a future lepton pair collider",
    ". of particular interest is the production of top quark pairs close to threshold , where the top quark velocity @xmath3 is small and the usual perturbative expansion in terms of the strong coupling breaks down due to coulomb singularities .",
    "the large top quark width @xmath4  gev prohibits the production of toponium states and leads to a cross section that rises smoothly when top pair production becomes kinematically allowed .",
    "furthermore , the large decay rate , @xmath5 , serves as an infrared cutoff , allowing the use of perturbative methods for the description of the non - relativistic top - antitop dynamics to a high degree of precision  @xcite .    in the past numerous studies",
    "have been carried out to assess the feasibility and precision for extracting various top quark properties from a threshold run@xcite .",
    "recently , next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd corrections to the total cross section were calculated using the concept of effective field theories@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the corrections were found to be as large as the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections . from the residual scale dependence in the nnlo result ,",
    "the normalization of the cross section was estimated to have @xmath6 uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that top quark short - distance mass parameters can be determined with a precision of @xmath7  mev or better from the shape of the cross section , if so - called threshold mass parameters are employed@xcite .",
    "however , the large nnlo qcd corrections to the normalization of the cross section seemed to jeopardize competitive measurements of the top width , strong top coupling  @xcite , or the top yukawa coupling in the case of a light higgs .",
    "moreover , the large nnlo corrections seemed to indicate that , despite the perturbative nature of the @xmath8 system , high precision computations are not feasible .",
    "a common feature of all the nnlo qcd calculations is that the running from the hard scale @xmath9 down to the non - relativistic scales which govern the dynamics of the top - antitop system was not taken into account . in other words , at nnlo potentially large qcd logarithms of ratios of the hard scale and the non - relativistic scales @xmath10 and @xmath11 were treated perturbatively . from weak decays of @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons , it is known that a consistent summation of logarithms between @xmath14 and the low - energy hadronic scales can significantly change the magnitude of wilson coefficients and the corresponding physical predictions ( see for e.g. ref .",

    "the summation of logarithms can be performed using renormalization group equations in the framework of `` velocity nrqcd '' ( vnrqcd)@xcite , an effective theory for heavy quark pairs .",
    "the logarithmic corrections treated in this work are at nnll order and fully include the known nnlo qcd corrections from refs .",
    "a complete summation requires knowledge of the wilson coefficients for potentials and non - relativistic production currents at this order . for the nnll potentials the required wilson coefficients have been calculated in refs .",
    "the ll running of subleading @xmath8 production currents is also required and is given below . for the leading production current the wilson coefficient is known at nll  @xcite and nnlo  @xcite . for this current only partial nnll results are known and an estimate is made for the uncertainty this induces in our result .",
    "the combination of known nnll results significantly reduces the size and scale dependence of previous nnlo qcd predictions  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we do not treat electroweak effects consistently at the same level as the qcd corrections , as implied by the counting @xmath20 used in this paper .",
    "this would require the inclusion of non - factorizable corrections as well as the single- and non - resonant background contributions , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "here we only include the top quark width through an imaginary mass term , which can implemented by the replacement  @xcite , @xmath21 into a calculation for stable quarks .",
    "for the total cross section this represents a consistent next - to - leading order treatment of electroweak effects  @xcite .",

    "fixed order calculations have limited validity when processes involve widely separated scales .    for non - relativistic top",
    "quarks the running spans an even larger range of energies than the above example , @xmath70 down to @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , at the order that anomalous dimensions depend directly on the @xmath11 energy scale ( nnlo ) , it is not too surprising that renormalization group improved perturbation theory is necessary to compute the @xmath72 cross - section . since @xmath73 ,",

    "renormalization group improved perturbation theory distinguishes the @xmath76 s that appear at each order .",
    "we note that in our nnll order results , the summation of logarithms which involve the @xmath11 scale do tend to numerically dominate .",
    "for our calculation we will employ vnrqcd  @xcite , an effective field theory which describes the non - relativistic dynamics of heavy quark pairs , where the non - relativistic scales @xmath80 ( momentum ) and @xmath81 ( energy ) are larger than the hadronization scale @xmath82 , @xmath83 being the heavy quark mass .",
    "this effective theory contains a consistent power counting in @xmath3 , so that a given feynman diagram contributes to a single order in the @xmath3 expansion .",
    "it also accounts for the fact that the momentum ( soft ) and the energy ( ultrasoft ) scales are correlated through the heavy quark equations of motions .",
    "finally , vnrqcd allows for the summation of logarithms of ratios of the hard scale @xmath83 and the non - relativistic scales using a velocity renormalization group .",
    "the most important momentum regions for heavy quark processes are those with ( energy , momentum ) that are hard @xmath84 , soft @xmath85 , potential @xmath86 , and ultrasoft @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "the effective theory is formulated by including only those quark and gluonic degrees of freedom which can become on - shell for scales below @xmath83 .",
    "the on - shell degrees of freedom are gluons and massless quarks with soft and ultrasoft energies and momenta , and heavy quarks with potential energies and momenta .",
    "all off - shell effects such as those from hard quarks and gluons , potential gluons , and soft quarks are accounted for by on - shell matching of vnrqcd to full qcd at the hard scale .    only ultrasoft energies and momenta are treated as continuous variables , and ultrasoft momenta are separated from larger momenta by employing the multipole expansion .",
    "soft energies and momenta appear as discrete indices for potential quarks and soft gluons and must be summed over , similar to the velocity index @xmath88 for the static quark in hqet  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the first few terms that are bilinear in the quark field @xmath89 are @xmath90 where @xmath83 is the pole mass , and there is a similar equation for the anti - quark field @xmath91 .",
    "sums over soft and potential energies and momenta in combination with ultrasoft integrations in loop integrals can be rewritten as continuous loop integrals of soft and potential energies and momenta .",
    "the vnrqcd lagrangian also contains operators that describe potential - type 4-quark interactions ( fig .",

    "loop integrals are regularized with dimensional regularization in @xmath92 dimensions using the @xmath93 subtraction scheme .    0.5 cm",
    "the crucial feature of vnrqcd is that the dimensionful @xmath93 subtraction scale for loop integrations over soft and potential momenta is @xmath94 , whereas for loop integrations with ultrasoft momenta it is @xmath95 . within dimensional",

    "the correlation between @xmath94 and @xmath95 is an inherent property of vnrqcd , since the energy and momentum scales are related through the quark equations of motion . for nrqed",
    "this correlation is necessary to reproduce through running the @xmath101 , @xmath102 contributions in lamb shifts , hyperfine splittings and the corrections to the ortho- and para - positronium decay widths  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group equations for wilson coefficients are determined in the canonical way with the exception that they are formulated in terms of the subtraction velocity @xmath1 .",
    "lowering @xmath1 to a scale @xmath103 of order the quark velocity sums all logarithms of the soft and ultrasoft scales into the wilson coefficients of the vnrqcd operators . at nnll order",

    "the @xmath8 state is predominantly coulombic , so @xmath104@xmath105 .",
