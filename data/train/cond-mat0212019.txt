    "the electron coherence in mesoscopic superconducting systems is one of the important topics of solid state physics . the low energy transport in these systems is essentially influenced by the andreev reflection @xcite , a unique process specific for normal metal / superconductor interfaces .",
    "the phase coherence between incoming electrons and andreev reflected holes persists in the diffusive normal metal at a mesoscopic length scale and results in strong interference effects on the probability of andreev reflection @xcite .",
    "these effects become prominent at sufficiently low temperatures where the thermal broadening is negligible .",
    "one of the remarkable experimental manifestations is the zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) giazotto , klapwijk , kastalsky , nguyen , wees , nitta , bakker , xiong , magnee , kutch , poirier .",
    "a calculation of tunneling conductance in a normal metal ( n ) / superconductor ( s ) junction is an interesting theoretical problem since quantum interference effects due to andreev reflection are expected .    for a clean ns contact in the presence of the interface potential barrier",
    "the conductance was calculated by blonder , tinkham and klapwijk @xcite ( btk ) in terms of the corresponding transmission coefficients on the basis of the solution of the bogoljubov - de gennes equations . from the general set of boundary conditions connecting the quasiclassical green s functions on both sides of the interface for arbitrary transmission probabilities , zaitsev @xcite derived the expression for the conductance similar to that by btk .",
    "the btk method @xcite is confined to ballistic systems .",
    "the generalization of this method to systems with impurities has been performed by several authors ( see the review beenakker1 ) . in a number of papers",
    "the transmission coefficients were directly calculated by numerical methods @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to apply such methods to most of relevant experimental situations .",
    "another approach , the so - called random matrix theory , was employed by beenakker @xmath1 @xmath2 , where the total transmission coefficients are expressed in terms of those through the normal part of the system and the normal / superconductor interface separately @xcite . within this theory ,",
    "the zbcp observed in experiments is understood as a resonance phenomenon related to reflectionless tunneling @xcite .",
    "the scattering matrix approach was later generalized to finite voltage and temperature.@xcite    on the other hand , a quasiclassical green s function calculation based on nonequilibrium superconductivity theories @xcite is much more powerful and convenient for the actual calculations @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the impurity scattering is included in the self - consistent born approximation and the weak localization effects are neglected . in the theory of tunneling conductance developed by volkov",
    ", zaitsev and klapwijk ( vzk ) by solving the usadel equations @xcite , the origin of the zbcp observed in several experiments was clarified to be due to the enhancement of the pair amplitude in the diffusive normal metal by the proximity effect volkov .",
    "vzk applied the kupriyanov and lukichev ( kl ) boundary condition for the keldysh - nambu green s function @xcite .",
    "the kl boundary condition is valid for the atomically sharp interface barrier dividing two diffusive metals . as shown by lambert _",
    "et al_. @xcite , this condition is exact in two limits of either high or low barrier transparency , with small corrections in the intermediate transparency range . by applying the vzk theory ,",

    "_ et al_. belzig ) .    the generalization of the kl boundary conditions for an arbitrary connector between diffusive metals was provided by nazarov within the so - called `` generalized circuit theory '' @xcite . in this theory , the mesoscopic system is presented as a network of nodes and connectors .",
    "a connector is characterized by a set of transmission coefficients and can present anything from a ballistic point contact to a tunnel junction .",
    "a conservation law of matrix current holds in each node .",
    "the method to derive the relation between matrix current and green s functions puts the results of ref.@xcite to the framework of landauer - bttiker scattering formalism .",
    "the boundary condition for keldysh - nambu green s function was derived in @xcite for an arbitrary connector including various situations from ballistic point contact to diffusive contact .",
    "actually , this boundary condition is very general since the btk theory is reproduced in the ballistic limit while in the diffusive limit with a low transmissivity of the interface , the kl boundary condition is reproduced .",
    "although a number of papers were published on charge transport in mesoscopic ns junctions , as far as we know , almost all of them are either based on the kl boundary conditions or on the btk model .",
    "however in the actual junctions , transparency of the junction is not necessarily small and impurity scattering in the dn is important .",
    "therefore , an interesting and important theoretical problem is the calculation of the tunneling conductance in normal metal / conventional superconductor junctions using the boundary condition from ref.@xcite since both the ballistic ( btk theory ) and diffusive ( vzk theory ) cases can be covered simultaneously . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the tunneling conductance in diffusive normal metal / insulator / conventional superconductor ( dn / i / s ) junctions for various parameters such as the height of the insulating barrier at the interface , resistance @xmath3 in dn and the thouless energy @xmath4 in dn .",

    "the zbcp becomes prominent for @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in such a case , with a further increase of @xmath13",
    "the zbcp changes into a zero bias conductance dip ( zbcd ) . in the low transparent limit ,",
    "the line shapes of @xmath14 are qualitatively the same as those obtained by vzk theory @xcite .",
    "when the transparency of the junction is almost unity , @xmath5 always exhibits a zbcd except for the special case of @xmath15 , i.e. the btk limit .",
    "the measure of the proximity effect , @xmath16 , is mainly determined by @xmath13 and @xmath4 , where @xmath17 is the resistance from the insulating barrier .",
    "the proximity effect enhances ( reduces ) the magnitude of @xmath14 for junctions with low ( high ) transparency .",
    "\\4 . even for junctions between conventional @xmath18-wave superconductors",
    ", we can expect a wide variety of line shapes of the tunneling conductance , a zbcp , zbcd , @xmath0-shaped structure , and a rounded bottom structure .",

    "the sizes of the ballistic and scattering zones in the current flow direction are much shorter than the coherence length .",

    "recently , this theory has been revisited to account for diffusive transport in the normal metal in ref.@xcite , where an extension of the circuit theory was provided for unconventional superconductor junctions .",
    "a general relation was derived for matrix current , @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , which is available for unconventional superconductor junctions with mabs .",
    "an elaborated example demonstrated the interplay of mabs and proximity effect in a @xmath129-wave junction .",
    "it is actually quite interesting to apply this novel circuit theory to the actual calculation of @xmath9 as in the present paper .",
    "such a direction of study is important in order to analyze recent tunneling experiments where mesoscopic interference effects were observed in high - t@xmath220 junction systems hiromi .",
    "we will present the obtained results in the near future golubov2 .    in the present study ,",
    "we have focused on n / s junctions .",
    "the extension of nazarov s circuit theory to long diffusive s / n / s junctions has been performed by bezuglyi _ et al _ @xcite . in s / n / s junctions , the mechanism of multiple andreev reflections produces the subharmonic gap structures on i - v curves @xcite and the situation becomes much more complex as compared to n / s junctions .",
    "moreover , in s / n / s junctions with unconventional superconductors , mabs lead to the anomalous current - phase relation and temperature dependence of the josephson current @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem is an extension of the circuit theory to s / n / s junctions with unconventional superconductors .",
