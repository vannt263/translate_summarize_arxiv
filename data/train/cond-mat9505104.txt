    "the zero - temperature properties of a number of two - dimensional heisenberg spin models displaying order - disorder quantum phase transitions have recently attracted much attention .",
    "most efforts were connected with the square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnets with frustrating second @xmath6 and third @xmath7 nearest - neighbor bonds @xcite as well as with the two - layer quantum heisenberg models @xcite .",
    "the mentioned models present concrete realizations of the quantum order - disorder transition considered by chakravarty , halperin , and nelson @xcite using a macroscopical approach based on the quantum non - linear @xmath8 model in @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "notice that in the @xmath10 models the destruction of the nel state is a result of both the frustration and zero - point spin fluctuations , whereas the two - layer antiferromagnet can be turned through an order - disorder transition by varying the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the planes .",
    "the latter model constitutes an ideal system where the zero - point spin fluctuations destroy the classical nel state .",
    "less studied are the @xmath11 heisenberg antiferromagnets with random ferromagnetic exchange bonds @xcite which are currently considered as an appropriate model of the copper - oxygen sheets of lightly doped insulating high-@xmath12 superconductors .",
    "the idea comes from aharony and co - workers @xcite who suggested that the holes introduced into the @xmath13 layers are localized at individual oxygen sites .",
    "the coupling between the copper and oxygen spins results in an effective ferromagnetic coupling between the copper spins situated near an oxygen .    in this paper",
    "we study a quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet with two kinds of nearest - neighbor exchange couplings , regularly distributed on the square lattice , fig.1 .",
    "the relevance of the model is twofold .",
    "first , it combines the features of the @xmath10 and two - layer models in displaying the mentioned two mechanisms of destruction of the nel phase and , on the other hand , the model can be considered as a prototype of some more realistic antiferromagnetic models containing ferromagnetic bonds .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath14 where the sums run over the nearest - neighbor @xmath15 and @xmath6 bonds , respectively . in what follows we frequently use the notations @xmath16 . in the antiferromagnetic region @xmath5 , singh , gelfand , and huse @xcite",
    "have found for eq.([ham ] ) a critical point @xmath17 separating the classical nel ordered and a finite - gap quantum paramagnetic phases , using series expansions around the dimer hamiltonian @xmath18 , .",
    "they also argued that the critical exponents are consistent with those of the @xmath19 classical heisenberg model . in this study",
    "we analyze the zero - temperature phase diagram of the model in the range @xmath2 both analytically , reducing the problem to an interacting bose gas , and numerically , throughout exact diagonalization of small clusters . for ferromagnetic exchange bonds , at @xmath20 for classical spins",
    ", we found another critical point , dividing the nel phase from a helicoidal magnetic phase , fig.1 .",
    "the latter phase reduces to a three - sublattice nel state in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "the classical helicoidal phase is described by the equations @xmath22 where the classical spins @xmath23 and @xmath24 belong to the sublattice @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are perpendicular unit vectors in the spin space ; @xmath29 runs over the sites of the sublattice @xmath25 .",
    "the pitch vector @xmath30 and the phase @xmath31 are determined through the relations @xmath32 the angle @xmath31 can be chosen as an order - parameter of the continuous classical transition .",
    "below we concentrate on an analysis of the role of quantum spin fluctuations in the nel phase of eq.([ham ] ) . to this end , in the next section we follow a method overcoming the problems of the standard spin - wave theory ( swt ) connected to logarithmic divergences at the classical transition points .",
    "then we construct spin - wave series for the ground - state energy and on - site magnetization , and discuss the changes in the phase diagram implied by the interaction . in the last section we present exact diagonalization ( ed ) data for small clusters and compare them with the theory .",
    "we proceed with a short discussion of the results implied by the linear spin - wave theory ( lswt ) .",
    "lswt predicts the existence of a region around the classical transition point @xmath33 , where the magnetic states are completely melt by the zero - point spin fluctuations , fig.2 . in this approximation",
    ", the spin - liquid phase exists for arbitrary @xmath34 due to the logarithmic divergence at @xmath35 in the integral @xmath36 defining the reduction of the on - site magnetization @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath39 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath40 can be regarded as an aftereffect of the classical `` soft lines '' at the critical point in the low - energy magnon dispersion function @xmath41 due to the continuous character of the classical transition , one could expect the same behavior when the interaction is switched on .",
    "a consideration valid in the large-@xmath42 limit , and based on an appropriate quantum nonlinear @xmath8 model on the critical line @xcite , predicts the existence of a disordered spin - liquid phase in an exponentially small region around the critical line .",
    "there are some indications that the spin - liquid phase survives for arbitrary @xmath42 up to the extreme quantum limit @xmath43 @xcite . in our case , however , the structure of the quasiparticle spectrum ( i.e. , the number of goldstone modes ) is changed , so that the problem requires a special study @xcite of the helicoidal phase , wich is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "lswt also qualitatively predicts the transition to a finite - gap quantum paramagnetic state in the antiferromagnetic , @xmath5 , region of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "however , the estimate @xmath44 considerably exceeds the series estimate @xmath45 .",
    "the situation is analogous to the one in two - layer antiferromagnets @xcite , i.e. , swt is not successful because of the enhanced longitudinal spin fluctuations .",
    "one of the purposes of the present study , using also exact diagonalization data , is to see to what extent swt can be trust in approaching the quantum paramagnetic phase .",
    "our model has the advantage of permitting exact diagonalization studies for large enough clusters .      as mentioned above , the standard spin - wave series are divergent at the classical transition point @xmath33 . for example , the first - order correction to the on - site magnetization @xmath46 is expressed through the following divergent integrals @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "since in the swt formalism the on - site magnetization is a two - boson operator , it is clear that the divergences in the first - order correction @xmath46 come from two - boson interaction terms . a straightforward way to improve",
    "the situation is to use a normal - ordered operator form for the interaction .",
    "this approach leads to renormalization of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum and to some resumed swt series starting now from an appropriate mean - field theory ( mft ) . instead of @xmath50 , the new series are , however , governed by a formal small parameter @xmath51 introduced in front of the quartic dyson - maleev normal - ordered boson interaction .",
    "therefore , the quality of the series should be controlled through another method . in our study",
    "we present exact diagonalization data for small clusters .",
    "let us briefly describe the procedure leading to the spin - wave series .",
    "swt requires three subsequent transformations . through a standard dyson - maleev bosonization scheme",
    ", the original spin hamiltonian transforms into equivalent boson hamiltonian . in the usual swt",
    "the two - boson terms scaling with @xmath34 constitute the free - boson hamiltonian @xmath52 which fixes the @xmath50 series .",
    "as it was mentioned above , in our case more convenient is to diagonalize the quadratic part of the hamiltonian by means of a generalized bogoliubov transformation , also touching on the anharmonic terms @xcite .",
    "the new quadratic hamiltonian @xmath52 can be obtained in the following way .",
    "first , we subsequently do the fourier and quasiparticle bogoliubov transformations , the latter being defined through the relations @xmath53 where the dyson - maleev interaction @xmath54 is in a normal - ordered operator form ( see appendix a ) .",
    "then @xmath55 is the mean - field ground - state energy and @xmath52 is a quadratic free - particle hamiltonian , containing also contributions from the operator ordering of the quartic interaction term .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath52 , which in terms of quasiparticle operators reads @xmath56 , \\label{hoo}\\ ] ] requires @xmath57 . in principle",
    ", the condition @xmath57 leads to some integral equations for @xmath58 and @xmath59 studied in the general case by obukhov @xcite . recently",
    ", similar method has been applied to the @xmath60 model @xcite .",
    "note that the so - defined mean - field theory can also be regarded as a result of the variational equations @xmath61 ( under the constraint @xmath62 ) , defining the generalized bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the quality of the discussed perturbation scheme mainly depends on the quasiparticle interaction strength playing the role of a physical small parameter .",
    "particularly , the latter is expected to increase near the critical points .",
    "the model hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) represents a convenient system to check the theory due to the existing two critical points and a numerical - series estimate @xcite for the order - disorder transition point .",
    "the above program is straightforward for eq.([ham ] ) and leads to a renormalization of the bare coupling @xmath63 .",
    "the implicit equation for the factor @xmath64 reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 the renormalization factor @xmath67 defines ( up to an irrelevant phase factor ) the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath68 @xmath69 notice that one can not choose the phase factor so as to make both @xmath58 and @xmath59 real functions .",
    "the quasiparticle excitation spectrum reads @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a numerical factor analogous to oguchi s correction @xcite , @xmath72 .",
    "the ground - state energy @xmath55 and on - site magnetization @xmath73 in this approximation are @xmath74 @xmath75 we will see below that the mean - field estimate for the ground - state energy @xmath55 is in agreement with ed in a large region of the phase diagram .",
    "the on - site magnetization @xmath73 vanishes at @xmath76 , i.e. , there is a shift of the classical transition point towards the helicoidal phase .",
    "this phenomenon is known as `` villain s order from disorder''@xcite .",
    "the transition to quantum paramagnetic state in mft is located at @xmath77 , which is approximately twice larger than the series estimate .",
    "below we show that the second - order correction to this result improves the estimate .",
    "now we proceed with a calculation of the second - order @xmath78 corrections to @xmath55 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is easy to see that the first - order corrections both to @xmath55 and @xmath73 identically vanish for the normal - ordered interaction @xmath54 .",
    "the second - order correction to @xmath55 has the standard form ( appendix b ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the quasiparticle energies eq.([ek ] ) .",
    "the expression for the second - order correction to the on - site magnetization consists of two parts ( see appendix b ) @xmath81 where @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84 \\nonumber \\\\         & + & v^{(8)}(3412)\\left [ \\frac{u_1 ^ 2x_1}{e_1}v^{(6)}(1234)+ \\frac{u_4 ^ 2x_4}{e_4}v^{(3)}(1234)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the last equations the sums run over the vectors @xmath85 from the magnetic brillouin zone ; @xmath86 is the kronecker function .",
    "the explicit expressions for the vertex functions @xmath87 , @xmath88 are given in appendix a. a straightforward task is to show that the above @xmath89 integrals defining @xmath90 and @xmath91 are convergent , using the vertex expansions near @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath89 integrals written above were calculated using a standard gaussian method for a set of lattices with up to @xmath94 cells ( each containing 4 points ) and then the results were extrapolated to @xmath95 .",
    "starting from the @xmath96-cell lattice the results change monotonously and ensure the precision presented in tables 1 , 2 .",
    "for the pure @xmath97 heisenberg model , the series for the ground - state energy @xmath98 and on - site magnetization @xmath99 read @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 . the estimates for @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "are in accord with previous large@xmath103 @xcite and numerical @xcite series results .",
    "the above series show that in the pure model the second - order @xmath78 corrections are numerically small ( i.e. , the effective quasiparticle interaction is weak ) which means that the theory is self - consistent up to this order . as a matter of fact",
    ", the corrections @xmath90 do not exceed @xmath104 of the mft values in the whole range @xmath105 where the on - site magnetization @xmath99 is positive .",
    "notice that the second - order correction @xmath90 becomes negative @xcite for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , table 1 .",
    "the second - order correction to the on - site magnetization @xmath91 is less than @xmath108 as compared to @xmath73 in the interval @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath91 is negative for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , table 2 .    in fig.3",
    "we show the swt results for the ground - state energy of eq.([ham ] ) compared with ed data .",
    "the ed data are slightly size dependent , so that , for sake of clarity , we present only the results for a cluster with @xmath112 spins . in the parameter range @xmath113 we find excellent agreement with ed data",
    ". remember that @xmath45 is the numerical - series estimate for the order - disorder critical point @xcite , and @xmath35 is the lswt estimate for the second critical point of eq.([ham ] ) . for @xmath114 and",
    "@xmath115 one observes an increasing discrepancy with ed data . at the same time , the theory implies very small corrections to the zeroth - order energy @xmath55 in the whole range @xmath116 .",
    "analogous behavior of the swt series has recently been indicated by chubukov and morr @xcite in the two - layer heisenberg antiferromagnet when approaching the quantum paramagnetic phase .",
    "it was argued , using an appropriate bosonization scheme @xcite , that the spin - wave description fails due to the enhanced longitudinal spin fluctuations near the quantum paramagnetic phase . near the classical transition point @xmath33 , where the melting of the nel state is a result both of the frustration and zero - point spin fluctuations ,",
    "the discussed discrepancy is less pronounced .    as a whole , the second - order correction to the on - site magnetization @xmath91 , fig .",
    "4 , improves the estimates for the helicoidal @xmath117 and paramagnetic @xmath118 critical points .",
    "however , the estimate for @xmath119 is still twice larger than the numerical - series result @xmath120 . at the same time , for instance at @xmath121 , the correction @xmath91 is less than @xmath122 from the mean - field value @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "4 we also present extrapolated ed data for the on - site magnetization deduced from the antiferromagnetic structure factor @xmath123 using the cluster set @xmath124 and the extrapolation ansatz @xmath125 .",
    "the ed estimate @xmath126 at @xmath127 is smaller ( but in agreement with other ed data using also the @xmath128 cluster @xcite ) than the swt and numerical - series results mentioned above .",
    "the above discrepancy probably indicates the importance of the next - order term in the extrapolation ansatz @xcite .",
    "notice that our ed estimate @xmath129 is in reasonable agreement with the numerical - series result @xmath17 .",
    "the swt result @xmath130 , fig .",
    "4 , also exceeds the estimate obtained through an exact diagonalization of small clusters with @xmath131 and @xmath132 spins .",
    "the ed data predict a phase - transition point @xmath133 which is close to the classical result @xmath33 . here",
    "the situation is analogous to the one in the @xmath60 model containing frustrating diagonal bonds .",
    "for this model , both lswt and the recent ed data@xcite predict a complete melting of the nel phase at @xmath134 , whereas an inclusion of the spin - wave interaction changes the estimate at least up to the classical transition point @xmath135@xcite .",
    "there is a smaller swt estimate @xmath136 based on the standard large - s expansion @xcite , however it comes from large negative corrections @xmath91 reducing the effect of the diverging @xmath46 term , eq.([m1 ] ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied the influence of quantum spin fluctuations on the zero - temperature phase diagram of a @xmath0 square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet with two kinds of nearest - neighbor exchange bonds .",
    "the phase diagram is found to contain a helicoidal magnetic phase and a finite - gap quantum paramagnetic phase , both of them being separated through continuous transitions from the classical nel phase .",
    "we constructed an appropriate spin - wave expansion and used exact - diagonalization data to find the changes of the phase diagram implied by the zero - point spin fluctuations .",
    "the latter approach reveals in particular the limits of the spin - wave description coming from the enhanced longitudinal spin fluctuations near the phase boundaries . the disagreement with ed data is strongly revealed in approaching the quantum - paramagnetic - phase boundary . in a forthcoming paper @xcite we present , in particular , ed - based analysis concerning the finite - gap quantum paramagnetic phase .",
