    "the intrinsic luminosity and color distributions of red clump k giants is determined by the evolution of stars from the main sequence and the initial mass function , is fairly narrow ( @xmath35 mag ) and should not change with distance .",
    "we use the wavelength - independent effect of distance on apparent magnitude ( the 1/d@xmath36 change in flux ) , together with the wavelength - dependent effect of extinction , to determine the average extinction per unit distance , and thus the absolute ratio of extinctions , @xmath8 .    in figure [ jjk284 ] , the apparent j magnitudes of the field stars near @xmath3  284 are plotted against their @xmath37 colors .",

    "distance spreads the distribution vertically in the figure ; extinction moves a statistically uniform sample of stars vertically and horizontally by an amount proportional to distance , provided that the dust per unit distance is approximately constant .",
    "we note that the dwarf and giant sequences are not parallel  this is expected if the distribution of dwarfs is affected not only by interstellar reddening at faint @xmath4 but also by the addition of intrinsically faint , numerous cool dwarfs .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of giants , by contrast , are dominated by the red clump giants of early k type , with fairly narrow color and luminosity distributions .",
    "there are no intrinsically faint local stars to be added to the giant sequence at faint @xmath4 ; instead , we have a population of intrinsically similar beacons , spread along the line of sight .",
    "the distinct red clump feature is discussed and exploited to probe galactic structure by @xcite , and further used by @xcite to calculate the amount of extinction along certain galactic lines of sight .",
    "the 859 points redward of the giants in figure  [ jjk284 ] are probably mostly intrinsically red asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "we perform a 4-variable minimization to fit the curved red giant branch star locus and determine the amount of extinction per unit distance .",
    "the curve can be written parametrically as a function of distance @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the average extinction per unit distance in the @xmath4 band , assumed constant for a given line of sight .",

    "the range in fit coefficients is larger than the numerically calculated sigma for each fit , and we use that larger range as our quoted uncertainty .",
    "the uncertainty in the extinction per unit distance @xmath43 is larger than in the ratio @xmath47 , because it depends on assuming the absolute @xmath4 and @xmath6 magnitudes of the red clump .",

    "the extinction of the more distant cloud is so high towards the rcw  49 giant h2 region that few red clump giants are seen beyond it ( see figure  [ jjk284 ] ) .",
    "if that cloud is associated with rcw  49 , as seems reasonable , then we can estimate the distance to be 5@xmath191  kpc , independently of any other distance measurement .",
    "finally , it is more difficult to fit the giant branch towards @xmath3  42 because of greater contamination by agb stars and the bulge red giants at magnitudes fainter than @xmath62 , but we find the same ratios of @xmath63 within uncertainties .",

    "a small number of highly evolved ( agb ) stars can also fall in the excluded region because of absorption bands in their atmospheres .",
    "we calculated fits using several different algorithms , and used the differences in results to estimate our uncertainties ; the simplest fit performed was a linear regression weighted by uncertainties in both axes .",

    "an alternative method for measuring the color excess ratios due to interstellar extinction that is not dependent on the intrinsic stellar color distribution is described by @xcite .",
    "the method consists of comparing a selection of stars presumed to be mostly behind an extincting cloud with a selection of stars not extinguished by the cloud ( `` off - cloud '' ) .",

    "this suggests an almost universal extinction law in the infrared . even towards the massive star - forming region rcw  49",
    "the extinction is very similar to that observed in the `` field '' regions .",
    "it is useful to estimate the extent to which the [ 8.0 ] irac band is affected by the silicate feature that peaks at 9.7@xmath1 m .",
    "most stars emit the peak of their emission far shortward of the irac wavelengths , and their emission in the rayleigh - jeans limit weights the filter response towards shorter effective wavelengths .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "science center - provided isophotal wavelength is 7.735@xmath1 m , at which the silicate opacity is @xmath3210% of that at 9.7@xmath1 m ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the iso spectra of heavily obscured objects in @xcite show",
    "8@xmath1 m fluxes that seem little affected by silicate absorption . nevertheless , the filter is broad , and silicate absorption in the diffuse ism appears consistent with a fwhm of 2.3@xmath1 m , possibly wider in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "convolution of the irac filter profile with a source emitting a rayleigh - jeans spectrum and with a gaussian absorption feature at 9.7@xmath1 m shows that the silicate feature could have as much as a 20% effect on the filter flux .",
    "studies of individual objects ( especially those with circumstellar dust ) could show more variation in the [ 8.0 ] extinction with source spectral shape than the average ism results presented here .",
    "the effect of the silicate feature on the [ 5.8 ] irac band is negligible .",
    "the ratio of polarization to extinction is an important diagnostic of the nature of grains .",
    "consider aligned grains of a particular type of material . at a particular wavelength ,",
    "both extinction and polarization are integrals of similar optical constants over the size distribution of the grains . both polarizations and extinctions at both 4 and 8@xmath1",
    "m have been measured in two molecular clouds : gl2591 and the bn object in orion ( see martin & whittet 1990 for observations and references . )",
    "because of atmospheric opacity , there are no measurements between these wavelengths . in gl2591 , @xmath91(4 @xmath1m)/@xmath91(8@xmath1 m ) @xmath142.5 ; in bn , @xmath91(4@xmath1m)/@xmath91(8@xmath1 m ) @xmath142.0 .",
    "the silicate strengths are also similar ; @xmath91(10@xmath1m)/@xmath91(8@xmath1 m ) is @xmath143.7 for gl2591 and 4.3 for bn . equation ( 4 )",
    "shows that our measured extinction ratio @xmath92 1.32 , significantly below the 4@xmath1m/8@xmath1 m polarization ratio of either object .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the polarization outside of the ice band is similar for these two clouds but differs significantly from our measured wavelength dependence of extinction , suggesting that _ the grains providing the 8 @xmath1 m extinction are different from the silicates at 10@xmath1 m and those providing 4@xmath1 m extinction _",
    "( carbonaceous ? ) , and that _ they are not as well aligned_.",
    "the alternative to this conclusion is that the dust within orion bn and gl2591 has a wavelength dependence of extinction significantly different from the dust observed by glimpse .",
    "we have measured the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction in the 1.258.0@xmath1 m region by combining glimpse and 2mass observations .",
    "the values calculated for two very different directions in the galactic plane are remarkably similar . even near the giant region",
    "rcw  49 , extinction is not significantly different .",
    "it may be possible to study variations of extinction with galactic longitude using the entire glimpse survey , expected to be complete by early in the year 2005 .",
    "since the values of @xmath17 in the galactic plane are somewhat higher than at higher galactic latitude , there may be differences in the extinction at irac wavelengths as well .",
    "the similar derived behavior of the extinction along several different sightlines suggests that our relative extinction values @xmath0}/a_k$ ] may be generally applicable .",
    "our average extinction measurements may be used to correct glimpse and other irac data in the galactic plane .",
    "these values are provided in table  [ tab ] , and the simple formula of equation  [ fit ] provides an analytical fit of simple functional form .",
