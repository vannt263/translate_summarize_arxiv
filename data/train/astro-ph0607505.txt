    "@xcite recently reviewed the excitation of pulsations in certain low - mass stars by so - called `` fe - bump instability '' .",
    "this instability is caused by a significant contribution to stellar opacity from m - shell electrons in iron - group elements at temperatures around 200000k @xcite .",
    "it provides the driving mechanism for radial pulsations in certain extreme helium stars @xcite and p - mode oscillations in hot subdwarf b stars ( ec14026 variables : after prototype ec140262647 @xmath0 v361hya ) @xcite .",
    "the fe - bump opacity mechanism is effective in these stars because of an increase in the contrast between opacity due to iron - group elements and opacity from other sources . in the case of extreme helium stars ,",
    "the background hydrogen opacity is suppressed . in the case of ec14026 stars",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that , for radial and non - radial p - mode oscillations , the observed boundaries of the instability strip can be explained only by increasing the iron abundance ( @xmath1 ) without increasing the heavy element abundance ( @xmath2 ) as a whole .",
    "it was already well known that radiative forces act differentially on the ions in the stellar envelope such that substantial chemical gradients are established over a diffusion time scale @xmath3y @xcite .",
    "the consequent levitation and accumulation of iron in layers at around 200000k @xcite enhances the fe - bump opacity sufficiently to excite pulsations in about 10% of sdb stars within the ec14026 instability zone @xcite .",
    "the discovery of oscillations with periods of a few hours in many cool sdb stars ( pg1716 variables : after pg1716 + 426 ) has presented a challenge to stellar pulsation theory @xcite . while the radiatively - driven diffusion of iron can still operate in these stars , p - modes",
    "were reported to be stable in the chemically stratified models @xcite . on the other hand , non - radial g - modes of high radial order ( @xmath4 ) and high spherical degree ( @xmath5 )",
    "were found to be unstable , but only in models of stars cooler than those in which variability has been detected @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that , for homogeneous models of blue horizontal branch stars , non - radial g - modes of high radial order ( @xmath4 ) and low spherical degree ( @xmath6 ) could be excited even without any enhancement of the iron abundance , but only in a narrow range of effective temperature around 18000k .",
    "the width of the g - mode instability strip and the number of excited modes increases substantially with increasing iron abundance , but @xcite were unable to obtain unstable g - modes for @xmath7k .",
    "even these modes were only obtained with iron enhanced by a factor of twenty over a base metallicity @xmath8 and for @xmath9 . this theoretical g - mode",
    "blue edge is some 5000 k cooler than the hottest known pg1716 variables , balloon 090100001 and hs0702 + 6043 , which have @xmath10k @xcite .",
    "efforts to reduce this difference by varying the helium and iron abundances , and the overall metallicity , were unsuccessful .",
    "subsequently the authors have considered what other mechanisms might contribute to the instability of g - modes in pg1716 stars .",
    "this paper describes the surprising results that the explanation lies in the atomic physics used to compute the stellar opacities ( section 2 ) and that the theoretical blue - edge can be reconciled with observation by considering the individual rles of other iron - group elements including nickel ( section 3 ) .",
    "the consequences for theoretical models of stellar interiors and the atomic processes to be found therein are briefly considered ( section 4 ) , before conclusions are drawn ( section 5 ) .",
    ".assumed fraction of iron - group elements within the heavy element fraction @xmath11 : opal = @xcite , op = s92 of @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "as previously @xcite , we have assumed that the pg1716 variables are extreme horizontal branch stars and have constructed series of `` zero - age '' horizontal - branch ( zahb ) models having a helium - burning core with a mass of @xmath12 and with a hydrogen - rich envelope with mass @xmath13 ranging from @xmath14 to 0.034 .",
    "here we have considered only the case of @xmath15 .",
    "the surface layers are characterized by mass fractions of hydrogen @xmath16 and base metallicity @xmath8 . with iron and nickel enhanced by the pairs of @xmath17 given above .",
    "@xcite discuss variations with @xmath18 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , varying @xmath12 has no effect on the stability of g - modes .",
    "they also found the only significant effect of evolution is that g - modes cease to be excited when the core becomes radiative at the end of core he - burning .",
    "of course pulsation periods @xmath19 increase with radius @xmath20 . since @xmath21 or surface gravity @xmath22 , normal horizontal - branch evolution produces a period increase of @xmath23 dex in all modes .",
    "the high - temperature end of this zahb sequence corresponds with the locus of the short - period ec14026 variables .",
    "pg1716 variables are to be found at lower temperatures , with @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the lower limit probably does not represent a formal red edge ; horizontal branch stars at these temperatures are very scarce .",
    "we have tested the stability of each of our horizontal - branch models for _ non - radial _ p- and g - modes with spherical degree @xmath25 .",
    "the frequency range considered is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the angular frequency of pulsation normalized by @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the gravitational constant .",
    "[ g_normal ] compares the results for op and opal with normal composition . with op ,",
    "unstable modes are obtained even for @xmath30 . in general , the number and the temperature range of unstable modes is increased with op opacities .",
    "[ g_fe10ni10 ] compares the results for op and opal with @xmath31 . for modes with @xmath9 , g - modes",
    "are excited up to @xmath32 in op models , but only to @xmath33 in opal models .",
    "although less likely to be observable , they are excited up to @xmath34 for op models with @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the position of the models on the hr diagram hardly changes with the choice of opacity table .",
    "table  [ t_blueedge ] compares the theoretical blue - edge of the g - mode instability strip for different enhancements of iron and nickel , for op and opal models and for the three most observable modes , @xmath36 and 3 .",
    "it is clear that the use of op opacities combined with the inclusion of excess nickel can shift the theoretical blue - edge of the g - mode instability strip significantly closer to the observed blue edge .",
    "this prompts us to believe that @xcite correctly identified the oscillations in pg1716 variables as opacity - driven g - modes , and that the discrepancy in the predicted and observed blue edges can be solved by invoking more accurate atomic physics in the calculation of stellar opacity , as well as considering atomic species other than iron .",
    "the basic elements of this solution are that ( i ) the opacity peaks due to iron and nickel occur at a higher temperature in op than in opal , ( ii ) the op nickel peak occurs at a higher temperature than the op iron peak , ( iii ) at these temperatures nickel is a more efficient absorber than iron ( per ion ) , and ( iv ) radiative acceleration will force it to accumulate in the ni - bump region in exactly the same way as iron .",
    "it should , perhaps , have been no surprise that the introduction of op opacities would shift the instability blue edge .",
    "a more modest shift in the blue edge for high - order g - modes in slowly pulsating b stars was obtained by @xcite . since then",
    ", extensive work on the contribution of inner - shell electrons to the op calculations , has brought the op opacities into `` much closer agreement with those from opal '' @xcite .    directed at obtaining good atomic data for very large numbers of atomic transitions , opal uses single - configuration wavefunctions with one - electron orbitals @xcite .",
    "op originally obtained most of its atomic data using the r - matrix method to evaluate multi - electron wavefunctions , resulting in more accurate atomic data , but for fewer and simpler transitions @xcite .",
    "prompted by substantial differences between the first op results and opal , primarily at high temperature and densities , the introduction of configuration - interaction codes enabled op to include many more bound states and radiative transition probabilities , as well as auto - ionization probabilities and photo - ionization cross - sections @xcite .",
    "for many astrophysical situations , op and opal opacities appear to be in closer agreement with one another ( @xmath37 ) @xcite than with observation .",
    "for example , helioseismology results currently require an increase of @xmath38 in opacity below the base of the solar convective zone @xcite . while the results presented here do not directly suggest a solution to the solar opacity problem , they _ do _ indicate that improvements in the treatment of atomic processes used in the calculation of stellar opacities can still have substantial consequences for calculations of pulsation stability .",
    "these are especially important when amplified by radiatively - driven diffusion of elements into layers of high specific opacity , as in the outer layers of many early - type stars . in turn",
    ", these will impact on elemental stratification , on stellar radii , on boundaries of pulsational stability , and on pulsation periods derived for use in asteroseismology .",
    "we have analyzed the stability of models of hot zero - age horizontal - branch stars to nonradial g - mode oscillations .",
    "we have tested and confirmed the hypothesis that elements other than iron can raise the temperature of the so - called `` fe - bump '' in opacity at around 200000k . in doing",
    "so we have discovered that , within this `` fe - bump '' , recently updated op opacity tables provide more opacity at significantly higher temperatures than the opal tables .",
    "the higher temperature fe- and ni - bumps in the op tables have been combined with a tenfold enhancement of both nickel and iron abundances in the driving zone .",
    "this provides sufficient opacity at the right temperatures to shift the theoretical g - mode blue - edge to within 1000k of the observed blue - edge for pg1716 stars .",
    "given the approximate nature of our own calculations and the likely remaining uncertainties in the atomic physics , we conclude that , by modifying the driving mechanism identified by @xcite , the discrepany in the predicted and observed blue edges for pg1716 variables can be solved .",
    "in reaching this conclusion , we have demonstrated that g - mode pulsations in pg1716 stars provide a critical test of stellar opacity , substantially preferring the updated op calculations to opal .",
    "future work should include an investigation of the use of op opacities in models for ec14026 variables and op radiative accelerations in self - consistent models of chemical diffusion in extreme horizontal - branch stars , as well as the influence of important opacity providers other than iron and nickel ( e.g. chromium , manganese , vanadium ) .",
    "detailed work for asteroseismological analyses will need to consider a wide range of additional physics , including the effects of evolution and time - dependent diffusion theory and core mass on predicted periods .",
    "travel support for this collaborative project was provided through pparc grant ppa / g / s/2002/00546 .",
    "this work has made extensive use of of the op and opal webservers .",
