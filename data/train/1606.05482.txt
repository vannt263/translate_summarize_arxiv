    "<S> intensity gradients observed for high aspect ratio devices are undetectable when using these highly conductive electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> flat lights on polymer substrates are found to be resilient to repeated and flexural strains .    </S>",
    "<S> * keywords : graphene , transparent electrodes , flexible , foldable , functionalised graphene , light - emitting devices , optoelectronics *    displays and screens are some of the most important devices within the field of optoelectronics . </S>",
    "<S> large - area displays are ubiquitous in advertising , ambient lighting , television , computer screens and almost every device with an interface for its control . </S>",
    "<S> current research is focused on making these devices suitable for the next generation of flexible and foldable optoelectronics . in particular , foldable displays and lighting systems </S>",
    "<S> would allow expandable screens for smart phones and electronic paper , wearable optoelectronics , rollable or collapsible wallpaper lights , and biocompatible light sources for medical devices . </S>",
    "<S> to date , alternating current electroluminescent ( acel ) technology uniquely enables the realization of flat , large - area ( @xmath2 1m@xmath3 ) and flexible light sources@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> acel devices have good contrast and uniform brightness </S>",
    "<S> . they can display images with high resolution when employing nano - patterned electrodes and they can withstand mechanical shocks as well as a wide range of temperatures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> presently , the maximum size of acel lighting panels is still limited to less than a square meter under practical operational conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the visible gradient of brightness which develops across a panel induced by the high sheet resistance ( typically larger than 100@xmath4 ) of the transparent electrode materials@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> highly resistive electrodes also require a high operational voltage and frequency , leading to increased power consumption and accelerated device degradation@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ( pedot : pss ) is a transparent and conductive polymer widely used by the printed electronics industry owing to its high mechanical flexibility . </S>",
    "<S> however , pedot : pss has a high sheet resistance of 850@xmath4 for an optical transparency of 90%@xcite , an unwanted blue tinge@xcite and limited environmental stability@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when exposed to relative humidity of just 40% , the uptake of water by the hygroscopic pss leads to the development of shear lips when the films are deformed , greatly increasing the sheet resistance@xcite . moreover , the absorption of water combined with the acidity of pss is a well - known cause of degradation in device components@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> atomically thin conductors such as graphene possess many attractive properties for transparent electrodes , which overcome some of the limitations of pedot : pss . </S>",
    "<S> single layer graphene only absorbs @xmath2 2.3% of visible light and it is highly flexible@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sheet resistance of this single layer of carbon atoms exceeds 1k@xmath4 in its pristine form@xcite , making it unsuitable for large - area acel devices . </S>",
    "<S> meshes of metallic nanowires are an emergent technology characterized by lower resistivity than pedot : pss and graphene . </S>",
    "<S> however , these nanowires have several problems : the nanowire dimensions have to be accurately control to avoid failure due to mechanical stresses@xcite ; they suffer from optical haze due to different size and spacing from this nanowires @xcite ; lack electrical stability due to current - induced@xcite and electromigration - induced structural damaged @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) meshes have been employed in acel devices@xcite , but their high resistivity ( 5k@xmath4 ) prevents their use in large - area devices . </S>",
    "<S> the search for a low resistance , transparent , flexible and stable material is still ongoing . </S>",
    "<S> this long - sought material would take lighting technology from the rigid confines of a glass bulb or an electronic semiconductor chip to emerging flexible substrates such as textile fibres@xcite and paper technologies .    in this work we present the use of the outstanding transparent conductor fecl@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> intercalated few - layer graphene ( fecl@xmath5-flg)@xcite for highly uniform , flexible and foldable acel devices . </S>",
    "<S> fecl@xmath5-flg has a sheet resistance as low as 20@xmath4 and an optical transparency of 77% when using cvd - grown graphene@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is highly stable against 100% humidity and temperature up to 150^o^c @xcite , and was shown to be a promising material for work function matched transparent electrodes in photovoltaic and organic light emitting devices@xcite and photodetectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the performance of this emerging material against the widely - used conductive polymer pedot : pss and other graphene electrodes such as single - layer graphene ( slg ) and flg . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental findings demonstrate that fecl@xmath5-flg - based acel devices display up to 49% higher electroluminescent intensity at low operational voltage ( from 40v to 180v ) compared to devices embedding pristine flg . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to acel devices employing alternative electrode materials , the use of fecl@xmath5-flg transparent electrodes does not show any measurable gradient of the intensity of the emitted light in flat panels 4 cm long and 0.8 mm wide , owing to the low sheet resistance of fecl@xmath5-flg@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is in stark contrast to the experimentally measured 70% reduction in the intensity of the emitted light measured in acel devices embedding flg electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate the performance of this outstanding transparent electrode in flexible and foldable lighting devices fabricated on polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) . </S>",
    "<S> these flexible acel devices are both highly flexible , durable and foldable , showing no degradation in performance under flexural strains beyond the common requirements of wearable electronics applications and over more than 1000 bending cycles . </S>",
    "<S> our results pave the way for the next generation of energy efficient , flexible , high performance and large - area optoelectronics based on highly transparent and conductive electrodes .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1a shows a schematic of the inner structure of the studied acel devices . </S>",
    "<S> state - of - the - art graphene - based transparent electrode materials are employed and their performance compared to that of commercial pedot : pss . </S>",
    "<S> these materials are ( 1 ) high quality pristine single- and ( 2 ) few - layer graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition and ( 3 ) fecl@xmath5-intercalated few - layer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> all graphene materials were transferred from cu or ni to glass microscope slides via a standard pmma - assisted wet etching technique ( see experimental section ) . </S>",
    "<S> intercalation of flg with fecl@xmath5 was carried out in vacuum ( 2@xmath6 mbar ) positioning the anhydrous fecl@xmath5 powder and the few - layer graphene substrate in different temperature zones inside a glass tube . </S>",
    "<S> the flg and the powder are heated for 7.5 hours at @xmath7c and @xmath8c , respectively , with a rate of @xmath9c / min during the warming and cooling of the two zones . </S>",
    "<S> the intercalation of fecl@xmath5 and the doping of graphene are characterized analysing the up shift of the g - peak in the raman spectra of graphene ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> layers of light - emitting phosphor material ( doped zinc sulphide ) , dielectric ( barium titanate , batio@xmath5 ) and bottom electrode ( silver paste ) were deposited onto the transparent electrode by spin coating and dried in air at 120^o^c on a hot plate . </S>",
    "<S> the top and bottom electrodes were contacted as shown in figure 1a . in order to accurately examine </S>",
    "<S> the decay in emitted light intensity without the use of impractically large display panels , we designed electrodes with two different aspect ratios ( length : width of 4:1 and 30:1 ) and direct electrical contact at only one end of the transparent conductor ( i.e. with no bus - bar around the perimeter ) . </S>",
    "<S> the thicknesses of the phosphor and dielectric layers were calibrated to the supplier specifications of 30@xmath10 m and 25@xmath10 m respectively ( see cross section image in figure 1a ) . upon applying an ac voltage ( 681 hz and @xmath11 ) </S>",
    "<S> the flat panels emit a bright light , as shown in figure 1b . in total , we have characterized at least 4 different acel devices for each transparent electrode material .    </S>",
    "<S> the average emission spectra in acel devices with fecl@xmath5-flg and pristine flg for @xmath12 are reported in figure 2a . </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent that the devices with fecl@xmath5-flg electrodes display a significantly enhanced brightness compared to the case of pristine flg , reaching up to a 49% increase at the spectral peak ( @xmath2 500 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the emission spectra and total emitted light intensity of acel devices with fecl@xmath5-flg is also found to be stable in time , with no detectable change over a period of 4 months when storing the device in ambient conditions ( see supplementary information ) . in both cases , the emission spectra have a very similar shape stemming from the flat optical transmittance of fecl@xmath5-flg and pristine flg in the emission range of the phosphor layer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we fit the spectra of each acel device with the superposition of the four known gaussian emission bands ( @xmath13438 nm , 464 nm , 497 and 525 nm ) corresponding to the intraband transitions originating from sulphur vacancy states and a variety of surface states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> broadening of these peaks is mainly determined by variations in the size @xcite and crystalline phase @xcite of phosphor particles . </S>",
    "<S> the average intensity for fecl@xmath5-flg electrodes was found to be systematically higher ( see supporting information ) than that of pristine flg electrodes at any given wavelength and for any applied voltage in the range @xmath14 , see figure 2b . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected since the sheet resistance of fecl@xmath5-flg is approximately ten times lower than that of flg , leading to a higher average voltage across the electrode .    in figure 2c the light intensity at the emission peak ( @xmath2 500 nm ) for devices embedding flg and fecl@xmath5-flg electrodes </S>",
    "<S> is plotted as a function of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the bias dependence of the average light intensity is well described by the relationship between acel brightness ( @xmath16 ) and voltage ( @xmath17)@xcite : @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are empirical constants . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent agreement between experimental data and the fit to this alfrey - taylor relation demonstrates that the light emission is governed by a mott - schottky - type barrier , as previously reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pronounced gain in the average brightness measured in acel flat panels embedding fecl@xmath5-flg transparent electrodes is also apparent to the naked eye when biasing the devices with the same @xmath15 , see figure 2d .    to directly test the brightness gradient introduced by the different transparent electrode materials , we fabricated devices with high aspect ratios ( length : width , 30:1 ) with fecl@xmath5-flg , pristine flg , slg and pedot : pss transparent electrodes . in this geometry </S>",
    "<S> the non - uniform intensity of the emitted light brought about by the voltage drop along the transparent electrodes is readily accessible . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows the normalized intensity of the emitted light collected at spots of 5 mm diameter along the length of the device . </S>",
    "<S> this brightness was normalised to that of the point closest to where the transparent electrode is contacted . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements show that all of the transparent electrode materials , with the exception of fecl@xmath5-flg , display a sizeable drop of emitted light intensity moving away from the point where the external @xmath15 is applied . </S>",
    "<S> single layer graphene electrodes display the most dramatic drop in intensity , that is up to @xmath2 70% reduction at 27 mm from the contact . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , fecl@xmath5-flg does not display any measurable intensity gradient under the same experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed this surprising finding in all 11 studied acel devices ( see supporting information ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed spatial dependence of the light intensity for the different transparent electrode materials correlates well with their intrinsic resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the most resistive transparent electrodes studied in this work are single layer graphene ( @xmath2 1k@xmath21/@xmath22 ) and this material gives the largest light intensity gradient in acel devices </S>",
    "<S> . electrodes of fecl@xmath5-flg with just @xmath2 20@xmath21/@xmath22 produce no measurable light intensity gradient since these electrodes exhibit a negligible voltage drop over the studied length scales ultimately leading to a uniform light intensity across the whole surface of the devices .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , to demonstrate the capability of fecl@xmath5-flg as a flexible and foldable electrode , we study the performance of fecl@xmath5-flg based acel devices fabricated on a plastic substrate when subjected to a range of bending and strain conditions . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4a shows a sequence of pictures taken under the same conditions of exposure time and diaphragm for a representative device undergoing a folding cycle with a radius down to less than 3 mm and a light emitting area of @xmath2 4cm@xmath3 ( see supplementary video information ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent to the eye that the intensity of the emitted light does not change during the entire folding cycle . </S>",
    "<S> this is quantitatively presented in the plot of figure 4b , where we show the measured intensity of the emitted light to be independent of the flexural strain in the fecl@xmath5-flg electrode . </S>",
    "<S> the strain is defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total thickness of the device , @xmath26 is the thickness of the substrate and @xmath27 is the radius of curvature , see supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> the same graph also shows the corresponding values of radius of curvature on the upper x - axis . in our experiment , the curvature radius is purposefully varied in the range @xmath28 mm since an electronic device wrapped as a wristband would have @xmath29 mm ( based on an average adult thickness ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the light intensity was also found to be unchanged after performing more than 1000 bending cycles of the device around a tube with 7 mm radius , as shown in the inset of figure 4c . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the performance of a pedot : pss - based device under the same conditions is also shown . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that fecl@xmath5-flg is as flexible and durable to mechanical cycles as pedot : pss , known to be a highly flexible and resilient conductor . </S>",
    "<S> however , pedot : pss lacks environmental stability whereas previous experiments have shown that fecl@xmath5-flg can withstand high relative humidity of 100% at room temperature for at least 25 days@xcite . unlike pedot : pss , fecl@xmath5-flg has flat optical absorption and there are no known compatibility issues between fecl@xmath5-flg and other commonly used optoelectronic materials . </S>",
    "<S> a summary of properties of emerging transparent electrode materials and state - of - the - art systems used by the industry is presented in table 1 which demonstrates the outstanding features of fecl@xmath5-flg .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have conducted a systematic study of the light emission in electroluminescent devices with a range of graphene - based transparent electrodes and compared their performance to that of pedot : pss which is one of the most widely used conductive polymers in printed electronics . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments demonstrate that the implementation of fecl@xmath5-flg transparent electrodes in acel devices results in a dramatic enhancement of the intensity of the emitted light up to 49% at low operational voltage ( from 40v to 180v ) compared to devices embedding pristine few - layer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we show that owing to the intrinsic low electrical resistivity characterizing fecl@xmath5-flg , there is no detectable reduction of the emitted light intensity moving away from the contacts . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast to all the other studied materials , which display a sizable light intensity reduction - up to a 70% decrease for single layer graphene electrodes 4 cm long and 0.8 cm wide . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that acel devices embedding fecl@xmath5-flg electrodes are mechanically flexible and most importantly foldable . </S>",
    "<S> no change in the intensity of the emitted light is detected even after more than 1000 bending cycles with bending radius of just 7 mm . </S>",
