    "the next generation cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will be constituted of three types of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes : small- , medium- and large - sized telescopes .",
    "the array will be dedicated to the observation of the high energy gamma - ray sky with unprecedented sensitivity  @xcite over a broad range of energies ( 0.01tev@xmath1100tev ) .",
    "this instrument will enable astronomers and astro - particle physicists to refine models of gamma - ray sources and underlying non - thermal mechanism at work , to study the origin and the composition of the cosmic rays up to the knee region , question the nature of the dark matter , etc .",
    "these kind of telescopes detect cherenkov light emitted along developing showers in the atmosphere nearly uniformly illuminating the ground over an area of about 50000m@xmath0 .",
    "shower maxima of a gamma - ray induced electromagnetic shower occur at altitudes comprised between @xmath27 km and @xmath212 km , for a primary energy ranging from @xmath2100gev to @xmath2100tev .",
    "the photon density on the ground depends on the energy of the gamma ray , its incidence direction and the distance from the resulting shower axis .",
    "the displacement of the image centroid in the telescope camera is a function of the angular distance of the shower core , defined by shower impact distance and altitude of the shower and is typically about 1.5 for an energy of 1tev and an impact parameter of 150 m , and 3 to 3.5 for energies around 100tev with an impact parameter of 300 m .",
    "as very high energy showers penetrate deeply in the atmosphere and generate a large amount of light , they can be observed at a relatively large distance from the main light pool already with relatively small reflectors translating into the necessity of a deployment of telescopes with large field - of - view for the exploration of very high energy showers . in general , the required telescope field - of view in order to record contained shower images ranges between 3 and 10 depending on the energy range of interest .",
    "a promising design for wide field observations is the davies - cotton telescope  @xcite .",
    "its advantage is a point - spread function enabling a larger field - of - view than a parabolic design .",
    "the schwarzschild - coud design ( e.g.  @xcite ) is not considered further , as it presents technical and cost challenges compared to a conservative cta proposal using a prime optics design ( see also the comments in section  [ sct : winstoncone ] ) .",
    "it is demonstrated that once the field - of - view of the camera pixels and of the whole instrument together with the photo - sensor technology is fixed by means of physics arguments , only one parameter is left free .",
    "this parameter can be fixed as well , relating the worst optical resolution in the field - of - view , i.e.at the edge of the field - of - view , with the size of a pixel . having a reasonable cost model at hand",
    ", even the most cost - efficient single telescope or telescope design operating in an array can be derived .    knowing the anticipated angular size of a pixel from physics constraints , a requirement on the point - spread function of the telescope can be determined .",
    "if the point - spread function is identified by the root - mean - square of the light distribution , requiring a pixel diameter four times the root - mean - square ensures that most of the light from a point source at infinity is concentrated in a single pixel at the edge of the field - of - view .",
    "if simulations show that such a containment is not necessary in terms of angular resolution of the shower origin or background suppression , also a smaller value like twice the root - mean - square can be considered , c.f .",
    "if this requirement is not optimized or not met , either the physics outcome is worsened or the camera has more pixels than necessary and will not be cost - efficient .",
    "the cta array layout will consist of large size telescopes ( lst , primary mirror diameter @xmath224 m ) in the center , and successively surrounded with an increasing number of medium - sized ( mst , @xmath212 m ) and small - sized ( sst , @xmath26 m ) telescopes in order to instrument a ground surface area comprised between 4km@xmath0 and 10km@xmath0 .",
    "telescope spacings , sizes and field - of - views reflect the energy range to be explored by a certain type of telescope",
    ". the lst sub - array will be primarily focusing on the observation of the high energy gamma - ray sky with great precision below about 100gev , the inter - telescope spacing will be small , about 60 m and the single telescope field - of - view limited to about 34 .",
    "the sst sub - array will conversely be optimized for multi - tev observations , up to around 100tev allowing for large spacing of up to 300m500 m with relatively modest reflector size .",
    "the camera pixel field - of - view of these different telescope types will span between about 0.080.1 ( lst ) up to 0.20.3 ( sst ) , linked to the different shower intensity with its intrinsic fluctuations and the concurrent necessity of keeping the number of camera pixels reasonably low .",
    "consequently , this study will focus on reflector diameters in the range of a meter to about 30 m and on pixel field - of - views in the range between @xmath20.08 and @xmath20.3 . and is extended to off - axis angles of the incoming light up to more than 5 .    in the following ,",
    "first a description is derived for the relations between the existing design parameters of a cherenkov telescopes , e.g.focal length and reflector diameter .",
    "then , by including a semi - analytical treatment for the optical quality of a generalized davies - cotton reflector , this description becomes applicable for the design of real telescopes . at the end , the influence of the variation of the parameters on the optimized design is discussed .",
    "the light collection is one of the most important parameter of a cherenkov telescope and can be improved by , e.g. , an increase of the photo - detection efficiency of the photo - sensors or a rescaling of the system , i.e. , a corresponding rescaling of the reflective area and photo - sensor size . as current technology ( photo - multiplier tubes , hybrid photo - detectors or silicon photo - multipliers ) only offer a limited choice of photo - sensor sizes , the cherenkov telescope design parameter phase space is reduced .",
    "given a particular photo - sensor type , the addition of a light concentrator in front of the photo - sensor is the only way to increase the light collection efficiency .    in the following",
    ", it will be shown that the relationship between the characteristic parameters of an optimal telescope design ( pixel field - of - view and linear size , reflector diameter and focal distance ) is fully constrained , once the technological requirement ( photo - sensor size and the light - guide material ) and the physics requirements ( the pixel angular size and the field - of - view ) are frozen .",
    "this result is obtained by imposing restrictions on the value of the point - spread function at the edge of the field - of - view in order to keep adequate image quality and thus analysis potential .",
    "the theorem of liouville states that the maximum concentration theoretically achievable is defined by maintaining the phase space , i.e.the product of solid angle , defined by the incoming light rays directions , light ray momentum squared and the surface area crossed by the light rays .",
    "the theorem of liouville is applicable to the case of a winston cone with entrance area @xmath3 placed in front of a photo - detector of area @xmath4 , corresponding to the exit area of the cone .",
    "@xmath3 is defined provided @xmath4 , the solid angle @xmath5 defined by the light rays entering the cone and the solid angle @xmath6 defined by the light rays leaving the cone .",
    "winston has shown in  @xcite that the maximum concentration factor for a rotationally symmetric light concentrator is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the refractive index of the media in front of and inside the optical system with @xmath8@xmath101 in air .",
    "@xmath11  corresponds to the maximum angle at which a light ray enters the system related to the solid angle @xmath5",
    ".    if the system is not axisymmetric or the angular acceptance of the photo detector is smaller than @xmath12 ( as assumed in eq .  [",
    "eqn : concentration ] ) , @xmath13 has to be adapted accordingly .    besides the increase of the light collection area ,",
    "the use of cones enables a partial screening of the night - sky light pollution corresponding to @xmath11 being larger than the angle of light rays coming from the edge of the reflector .",
    "simulations  @xcite and recent concentration efficiency measurements  @xcite of solid cones ( @xmath9@xmath101.4 ) designed for the fact camera  @xcite demonstrated that their shape is nearly ideal , that the concentration factor reaches a value close to @xmath13 and the geometric loss is only of the order of a few percent excluding absorption loss . in the case of hollow cones ,",
    "fresnel reflection losses have to be considered at the surface of the photo - sensor .",
    "if the camera is sealed with a protective window , which is usually the case , also losses at the window surface need to be taken into account . by choosing a material for the cones and the protective window with a similar refractive index than the material of the photo - sensor light entrance , these losses can be omitted .",
    "combined with the almost perfect reflectivity of solid cones due to total reflection ( limited only by the surface roughness ) , solid cone usually outperform hollow cone .",
    "the concentration factor achieved with the winston cones is fundamentally similar to the size reduction of the focal plane in a schwarzschild - coud design and linked to the conservation of the space - momentum phase space according to the liouville theorem : the conversion of the spatial into momentum phase space , by means of winston cones or secondary optics . while cones reduce the acceptance of the incoming light rays from a large area at the entrance to a large angular acceptance and small area at the cone exit , the secondary mirror optics leads to a similar spatial compression and angular widening of the light rays at the photo - sensor and thus a reduced plate - scale . while cones are non - imaging devices , the secondary optics is imaging .",
    "hence , in the schwarzschild - coud design , it is possible to attain excellent optical resolution , in terms of cherenkov telescope requirements , with a field - of - view as large as 15 .",
    "both designs enable compression of the photo sensitive area by factors larger than ten w.r.t .",
    "their primary optics design .      in the case of a cherenkov telescope ,",
    "the light entering the cone comes from a reflector visible under a maximum angle @xmath11   defined from the focal plane center ] .",
    "the opening angle of the light at the entry of the cone is therefore well defined by the properties of the optical system , i.e.by the diameter of the reflector @xmath14 and the focal length @xmath15 , @xmath16 . @xmath17    combining this with eq .",
    "[ eqn : concentration ] yields @xmath18 for instance , taking the fact values , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we obtain the theoretically maximal achievable concentration factor @xmath21 , i.e.the linear size of the entrance area can ideally be larger than four times the linear photo - sensor size .",
    "in addition , the optical system defines the zoom factor or plate - scale , i.e.the field - of - view corresponding to a physical area in the focal plane .",
    "the correspondence between the angular size @xmath22 and the linear size @xmath23 on the focal plane is @xmath24 or in the limit of small @xmath22 , @xmath25    cameras in cherenkov telescopes are pixelized due to the use of photo - detectors . to increase the light collection efficiency further , and to maintain symmetry ,",
    "these pixels are usually aligned on a hexagonal grid , i.e.in closed package geometry . in recent years",
    ", magic has exploited the photon arrival time extracted from the measured pulse and demonstrated significant improvements in the sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "the technique , taking into account the change of the arrival time between neighboring pixels , performs best , if all neighbors are at an identical distance from the central pixel .",
    "consequently , the ideal shape of a pixel is hexagonal .",
    "the distance @xmath23 on the camera surface is the distance between two parallel sides of a hexagon , its area is @xmath26 combining with eq .",
    "[ eqn : baseformula ] , the plate - scale formula eq .",
    "[ eqn : platescale ] and eq .",

    "[ eqn : derivedformula ] ( @xmath29 for @xmath301 ) as @xmath31 it is immediately apparent that the focal length @xmath15 of the system is a direct consequence of the pixel field - of - view and the reflector diameter , if the properties of the photon detector and the material of the cones are known . for typical cherenkov telescopes , @xmath32 is between unity and two .",
    "below unity the resolution becomes too coarse and above two , not only the number of pixels and hence the price of a camera becomes too high , but also the camera holding structure becomes mechanically complex and hence disproportionally expensive .",
    "this constraint on @xmath32 applied to eq .",
    "[ eqn : focallength ] yields @xmath33    precisely the choice of @xmath15 and @xmath14 defines the optical quality of a mirror system . at the same time",
    ", the size of a single pixel defines a natural constraint on the optical quality of a system , i.e. , @xmath32 should be chosen such that the point - spread function at the edge of the camera is within a limit well defined by the pixel s field - of - view .",
    "the light collection area is important for a cherenkov telescope and typical reflector sizes range from a few to ten or twenty meters .",
    "however , with the current technology , it is not possible to produce large mirrors with the requested quality at a reasonable cost .",
    "furthermore , optical systems compiled from a single mirror suffer large aberration effects at large off - axis angles , while a wide field - of - view is necessary for the observation of multi - tev showers up to large impact parameters , as well as for extended sources .",
    "therefore , segmented mirrors are in use .",
    "the layout providing the best optical quality for segments of identical focal length is the so - called davies - cotton layout  @xcite , where the single spherical mirrors are located on a sphere with radius @xmath15 and focused to a point at @xmath34 .    the relevant quantity which influences the on - axis and off - axis optical quality is the focal ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the optical quality improves with larger values .",
    "this scale invariance statement is true only as long as the optical quality of a single mirror can be neglected against the optical quality of the whole system , which is generally the case at the edge of the camera .    to be able to constrain the optical point - spread function , a relation between the tessellation , the focal ratio and the resulting point - spread function is needed for a given maximum inclination angle of the light , i.e.at the edge of the field - of - view of the camera .          in  [ appendix : a ] , a formalism describing the point - spread function of an ideal davies - cotton reflector , i.e.a reflector with infinite tessellation is presented .",
    "the point - spread function is described by the root - mean - square of the light distribution . with the help of ray - tracing simulation , a reasonably good description of a real tessellated davies - cotton reflector",
    "is derived from this analytical approach in  [ appendix : b ] . including the correction factor which describes the deviation of the analytical approach from the simulations , a good description of the point - spread function",
    "is obtained .",
    "it is shown that the point - spread function @xmath35 of an ideal davies - cotton can be expanded into a polynomial in @xmath36 .",

    "[ fig : coefficients ] .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , it is required that the point - spread function is small compared to the pixel field - of - view at the edge of the field - of - view , so that the light of a point source is well contained in one pixel . defining the ratio @xmath45 between both , this requirement can be expressed as @xmath46 combined with eq .",

    "@xmath53    if a real camera housing is significantly larger than the photo sensitive area itself , a correction factor should be included .",
    "now the effective light collection area of the optical system can be deduced as @xmath54    if real setups should be compared , like e.g.davies-cotton and schwarzschild - coud , also other sources of light - losses must be included , such as geometrical efficiency of the cones ( light - loss at the edge of the mirror ) , total mirror reflectivity , cone transmission or reflection losses , or photo detection efficiency .      the relation given in eq .",
    "[ eqn : result ] includes several parameters which are subject to change . for simplicity , a standard setup has been defined to which altered setups are compared .",
    "silicon photo - detectors are a recent and very promising technology .",
    "therefore , a silicon photo - detector with a sensitive area of 36mm@xmath0 is chosen as a benchmark device .",
    "such devices are already commercially available with acceptable properties .",
    "although their sensitive area is still rather small compared to photo - multipliers , by increasing their light - collection with solid light concentrators , their light - collection area becomes reasonably large .",
    "such light - concentrators still maintain a reasonable weight and length in term of absorption .",
    "typical plexiglas materials have a refractive indices of the order of @xmath9=1.4 and are used hereafter as a reference .",
    "as the light - collection area of a telescopes scales directly with the photo - sensitive area , the most obvious use of small photo sensors is a small telescope sensitive mostly to high energetic showers . at high energies ,",
    "the collection area of a telescope array is of prime importance due to rapidly decreasing fluxes . due to the bright light - pool of high energy showers , telescopes with relatively small reflectors",
    "can be operated with large spacing of , e.g. , 400 m or more , c.f .  @xcite . since such spacings demand a large camera field - of - view , a field - of - view of 9 diameter",
    "is chosen as a reference .",
    "a typical reflector for a cherenkov telescope with davies - cotton layout enables the manufacturing of a primary reflector tessellated into spherical mirror of identical focal lengths . from the scaling with the tessellation number as derived in [ eq : realdc ]",
    ", it can be concluded that a layout with only three mirrors on the diagonal ( @xmath42=3 ) has still a significantly worse optical quality than a reflector with five mirrors on the diagonal .",
    "although the point - spread function at the center of the camera is clearly dominated by the mirror size , the relative influence almost vanishes at higher off - axis angles . since the solution with @xmath42=3 still shows a degradation of more than 10% compared to the solution with @xmath42=5 even at the highest simulated off - axis angles , it is discarded .",
    "on the other hand , a further increase of the tessellation number ( individual mirror size over primary reflector diameter ) does not significantly improve the optical quality .",
    "consequently , choosing @xmath42=5 is a good compromise and already close to the optimum achievable .",
    "comparable results were obtained in  @xcite although using a third order approximation overestimating the optical quality .",
    "it must be noted that the simulation does not take the point - spread function of the individual mirrors nor any possible misalignment into account which must be added quadratically to the result .",
    "however , for the solutions discussed here this can be neglected , c.f .",
    "in general , alignment errors can be kept minimal and individual mirrors can be machined with a point - spread function small compared to the point - spread function at the edge of the camera .    on average ,",
    "all davies - cotton designs with a reasonable @xmath32 have a root - mean - square of the light distribution in the tangential direction about two times larger than in the sagittal direction .",
    "ideally , the sagittal root - mean - square at the edge of the camera should fit a fourth of the pixel s field - of - view .",
    "this ensures that in the sagittal direction 95% of the light is contained within one pixel diameter and roughly 68% in the tangential direction .",
    "however , since the point - spread function is not gaussian and has long tails in tangential direction exact numbers for the light content might slightly differ .    for convenience ,",

    "this short time spread is not a problem for the observation of showers with a small size telescope as it is still small compared to the cherenkov light flash duration . for medium and large size telescopes ,",
    "a slightly different mirror arrangement should be chosen if time spread matters . by a mirror arrangement ,",
    "intermediate between a spherical ( davies - cotton ) and a parabolic design , the time spread can considerably be improved , maintaining the point - spread function almost completely .",
    "while the point - spread function is dominated by the majority of the mirrors , i.e. outermost mirrors , the time spread is dominated by the ones with the largest @xmath77 mirrors , i.e. innermost mirrors .",

    "for physics reason , the field - of - view is supposed to be between 9 and 12 ( leading to a reasonable @xmath32 between 1.5 and 1.8 assuming an optical quality of 4 and a tessellation number of 5 ) . requiring a pixel field - of - view in the order of 0.26 , possible solutions could be solid cones with a 36mm@xmath0 g - apd or hollow cones with a 60mm@xmath0 g - apd , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : cta ] .",
    "the manufacturing of 60mm@xmath0 g - apds is under discussion with hamamatsu .",
    "a rough estimate shows that a solid cone for such a device would be about three times longer than for a 9mm@xmath0 as used in fact .",
    "considering the transmission loss of 10% in the fact cones  @xcite , which is a very conservative estimate , such cones would have a loss in the order of 35% .",
    "since solid cones avoid the loss from fresnel reflection at the sealing surface and the g - apd surface , the real light loss would only be around 27% assuming that the hollow cone has a reflectivity of 100% which in reality is not true .    keeping the pixel field - of - view constant ,",
    "the gain in reflective area corresponds to the refractive index of the cone material squared . in the case of a refractive index of typical poly(methyl methacrylate ) pmma of 1.4 this is a gain of @xmath10100% reflective area , which outperforms the transmission loss significantly .    assuming that the manufacturing of a 36mm@xmath0 g - apd would be as easy as of a 60mm@xmath0 g - apd",
    ", one can compare a solution with a 36mm@xmath0 g - apd and a solid cone and a 60mm@xmath0 hollow cone ( assuming perfect reflectivity ) . in this case",
    ", the transmission loss of the solid cone is around 13% compared to 8% fresnel loss for the hollow cone . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution with the hollow cone yields a 15% smaller reflective area ( same pixel field - of - view ) or 27% more pixels ( same reflective area ) .",
    "assuming further that the price of the camera scales with the price of each channels , a reduction of the number of channels by almost 30% reduces the costs for the camera significantly .",
    "since the costs are also dominated by the price for the photo - detectors , and the price of g - apds , in the first order , scales with the sensitive area , it can be estimated that the price for the 36mm@xmath0 g - apds would be almost a factor of two lower than for the larger ones . in figure",
    "[ fig : cta ] possibly solutions for mst and lst designs are shown using g - apds and solid cones . on both cases",

    "this was achieved by a description of the optical performance of davies - cotton reflectors and introduction of the effect of light - concentrators . in particular",
    ", this study provides an analytical description of the optical performance of a tessellated davies - cotton reflector precise enough to enable performance studies without the need for dedicated simulations .    by including the effect of the light - collector into the system of equations , the available phase space of design parameters",
    "is reduced to a single parameter , once the photon detector has been chosen and either the pixel field - of - view or the camera field - of - view has been fixed by physics constraints . while the choice of photo sensor is usually defined by the availability on the market ,",
    "constraints on the camera field - of - view are a result of the physics targets .",
    "if these two parameters are fixed , the whole available phase space of possible solution can now be scanned by changing a single input parameter .",
    "it can , for example , be convenient to scan a reasonable range of the focal ratio @xmath32 and derive all other parameters accordingly . from the result ,",
    "the most cost efficient solution , or the one performing best in sense of physics targets can be chosen .    for the cherenkov telescope array ,",
    "several design options were presented .",
    "it could be shown that for the small size telescope , considering a camera field - of - view of 9 to 12 , a four meter reflector is enough if 36mm@xmath0 senors are topped with solid cones to achieve a pixel field - of - view in the order or 0.25 to 0.3 at reasonable @xmath32 .",
    "an alternative solution are hollow cones with correspondingly larger sensor area , which is disfavored because of the costs dominated by the sensor . an example plot which easily allows to determine reasonable options from the available phase space",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conclusion ] .",
    "the reflector diameter can easily be re - scaled linearly with the photo sensor size and the refractive index of the cone material .    for the medium size and large size telescopes , the most reasonable solution using small sensors would be the summation of three and seven , respectively . equipped with different sum - stages",
    ", these modules could be applied in any telescopes .",
    "larger silicon based sensors , expected soon on the marked , would allow a single - channel / single - sensor solution .",
    "using several small sensors in one channel has the advantage that the application of solid cones is possible in terms of weight and transmission and costs for photo sensors can be kept low due to their at least two times higher compression ratio .",
    "the davies - cotton design @xcite is known to be promising for wide field prime - focus telescopes and was studied earlier analytically  @xcite and through simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , the parametrizations are moderately accurate and non existing for tessellated reflectors .    here , parametrizations are provided , accurate at the percent level up to 12 field - of - view , for the ideal ( non - constructable ) davies - cotton telescope and accurate to a few percent for a realistic davies - cotton telescope with arbitrary tessellation of the reflector .      the major issue of the design of a telescope is the reflector and its optical performance .",
    "since design parameters like the field - of - view of a single pixel or the field - of - view of the whole camera are closely related to the reflectors optical performance , it is important to understand the relation between the reflector design and its performance .",
    "unfortunately , neither spherical nor parabolic mirrors can provide both , good optical point spread function for on - axis and inclined rays , at the same time , because the distance between any point on the mirror surface to the focal point does not match the local focal length defined by the local radius of curvature .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a spherical mirror , also the shape of the mirror surface is not ideal compared to a parabolic mirror .",
    "the parabolic shape ensures that parallel rays from infinity are well focused into a single point ( due to the definition of a parabolic surface ) while in the spherical case this is not the case .",
    "that means that in both cases rays hitting the mirror far off its center have their focal point not at the focal plane . in the case of a spherical mirror",
    "they also miss the focal point ( _ aberration _ ) .",
    "consequently , the ideal mirror would be a combination of two properties : a mirror surface which is shaped such that it has the right focal distance at any point , but at the same time any point is correctly oriented , so that focal distance and direction are correct .",
    "since local normal vector and local curvature can not be disentangled such a mirror can only be a theoretical construction .",
    "tessellating the reflector into individual mirrors , this behavior can be approximated , as shown by davies and cotton , if the reflector is built from several spherical mirrors which are placed on a sphere around the focal point . in this case , the reflector can have the correct focal distance locally and , at the same time , the mirror elements can be oriented such that they correctly focus to the focal point .",
    "apart from an improved optical performance for inclined rays , the production of several small and identical mirrors is also much more cost efficient than the production of a single large mirror .    since any optical system can always be linearly scaled , in the following a scale factor is chosen such that the reflector diameter corresponds to unity , which is identical to defining @xmath16 with @xmath15 being the focal length and @xmath14 the diameter of the mirror .",
