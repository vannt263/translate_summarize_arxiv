    "in this work we present a theoretical and experimental study of low - frequency voltage noise in @xmath1m - thick films of amorphous silicon ( a - si : h ) under the condition that electric current flows perpendicularly to the plane of the films .",
    "this phenomenon is associated with resistance fluctuations , which , in the presence of current , manifest themselves as voltage noise .",
    "the spectrum of this noise is close to @xmath0 , where @xmath2 is the frequency .",
    "our motivation for this work is two - fold . on the one hand , we describe a new microscopic mechanism of @xmath0 noise , which should be present in a variety of systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the particular material studied , a - si : h , is very important technologically because of its applications in various photo - voltaic devices ( such as e.g. solar cells and thin - film transistors ) .",
    "the technological importance of a - si : h represents the further advantage , that this material has been heavily studied in the past , and , therefore , its microscopic characteristics , which we need as input to our theory , are reasonably well known@xcite .    among many existing proposals aimed at the general description of @xmath0 noise ,",
    "perhaps , the most successful one is the model of an ensemble of two - state systems having a broad distribution of activation energies ( bdae)@xcite . the bdae model gives a reasonable explanation for the generic nature of spectral shapes close to @xmath0 and , furthermore , ( after dutta , dimon and horn@xcite ) predicts the temperature dependence of the small deviations from that shape .",
    "it is the experimental observation of those small deviations in a variety of systems@xcite that constitutes the strongest evidence for the adequacy of the bdae model .",
    "however , this model as such does not represent a full theoretical description of the noise , because it does not address the origin of the two - state systems and the mechanism by which they couple to the resistance fluctuations . as a result , the absolute intensity of the @xmath0 noise remains an adjustable parameter .    in principle , it is not obvious at all that a universal mechanism should underlie every occurrence of @xmath0 noise in the systems , that seem to obey the bdae description .",
    "however , the unsatisfactory reality is that there are no examples ( at least , we are not aware of any ) , when a microscopic mechanism of the @xmath0 noise has been worked out in full detail for one `` bdae '' system , and , at the same time , the results of the calculation based on that mechanism have agreed with experiment .",
    "here `` full detail '' means : ( i ) the identification of microscopic fluctuators with their activation energies and activation rates ; ( ii ) identification of the mechanism that couples those fluctuators to the resistance noise ; and ( iii ) a first principles calculation of the absolute noise intensity .",
    "such a `` full detail '' treatment was recently given by us for a - si : h in ref .",
    "this treatment , however , included many material - specific details , not all of which were crucially important for the understanding the noise mechanism . in this work ,",
    "we describe the same experimental setting as in ref .",
    "@xcite but do so in a more intuitive way by replacing some detailed calculations with simple estimates .",
    "it turns out that the outcome of such a description is not much different from that of the full calculation .",
    "we study an @xmath3 film of , where @xmath4 denotes an electron doped layer , and @xmath5 an undoped layer .",
    "the thickness of each of the @xmath4-layers is 40  nm , while the thickness of the @xmath5-layer is .",
    "the area of the film is @xmath6 .",
    "the film was grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) .",
    "it was subsequently thermally annealed and , afterwards , kept protected from light .",
    "the setup of our noise experiments was the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we observed voltage noise spectra at frequencies @xmath7hz and temperatures @xmath8k in the presence of electric current flowing perpendicularly to the plane of the film .",
    "the film itself was thus sandwiched between highly conductive contact layers .",
    "the voltages applied were small enough to correspond to the linear part of the film s i - v characteristic .",
    "the experiments were performed without illumination of the film .",
    "the previous studies of @xmath0 noise in the films of a - si : h@xcite illustrate the general situation described in section  [ introduction ] : although a large body of diverse phenomenological information about the noise has been collected , the problem of identifying the origin of the noise has remained open .    in this work",
    "we focus only on one out of many possible situations that have been studied experimentally : perpendicular current , no illumination , undoped main resistivity layer , annealed sample . in that case , it was shown experimentally@xcite that ( i ) the statistics of noise is gaussian and ( ii ) the temperature dependence of the spectral slope ( parametrizing the small deviations from the exact @xmath0 dependence ) agrees well with the bdae model .",
    "it was evident since the early studies@xcite , that the timescales of activation for the electron escape from deep defects in a - si : h correspond well to the frequency range where the noise was observed .",
    "the problem was that , even though the energies of the defect levels have a relatively broad distribution , the fermi factor limits the noise to the levels , which are located in the thermal window around the chemical potential@xcite .",
    "this thermal window is not broad enough to give a spectral shape close to @xmath0 .",
    "if , nevertheless , one insists on computing the noise intensity associated with the fluctuations of the defect occupation numbers , then there are still two general scenarios : the resistance fluctuations can be due to the fluctuations of either the number of free carriers or their mobility .",
    "the fluctuations of the number of free carriers can be produced by the random emission and capture of free electrons by deep defects .",
    "this possibility was investigated by verleg and dijkhuis@xcite ( albeit on the basis of a very simple model ) .",
    "they came to conclusion that the noise intensity due to this mechanism would be several orders of magnitude smaller than the one observed , and , furthermore , the timescale of such a noise would be controlled by the fast capture times rather than the slow emission times , which shifts the characteristic noise frequency away from the observation range .",
    "later , a more detailed theoretical investigation of this type of noise has supported the conclusion of a low noise intensity@xcite .",
    "a simple realization of mobility fluctuations could be related to the change of the defect cross - sections .",
    "this scenario , however , has the problem that the relative concentration of deep defects is too small to affect the transport of free carriers .",
    "the mobility of free carriers is controlled mainly by the elastic scattering from the short - range inhomogeneities of the amorphous lattice structure .",
    "other mechanisms of the @xmath0 noise in a - si : h have also been proposed , including thermally activated chemical processes@xcite , generation - recombination processes with various degrees of sophistication@xcite , and , finally , resistance networks near percolation threshold@xcite ( in the context of coplanar currents ) .",
    "although , in principle , each of these proposals can be viable , none of them has been tested conclusively so far .",
    "in the following , we shall revive the old idea that the noise is caused by the fluctuations of the defect occupation numbers .",
    "that idea , however , is complemented by a novel noise mechanism , which involves long - range potential fluctuations induced by fluctuations of the defect charges .",
    "these potential fluctuations then cause the fluctuations of the local densities of conduction electrons , which , in turn , lead to the observed resistance fluctuations .",
    "it is important to realize that the above mechanism should certainly be present in the material studied .",
    "its theoretical description is quite straightforward and , at the same time , gives the value of integrated noise intensity without adjustable parameters .",
    "therefore , if such a theory produces the noise intensity comparable with the one observed in experiment , then it is quite unlikely that another noise mechanisms contributes to the experimental spectrum on the top of the one just described .",
    "our theoretical description also contains a new , though very simple , idea that the distribution of the fluctuation rates of defect charges comes not just from the distribution of the energy levels of electrons bound to the defects , but also from the distribution of the activation barriers , which electrons have to overcome to escape from the defects . unlike the former distribution",
    ", the later one is not truncated by the fermi factor@xcite and thus can underlie the spectral shape close to @xmath0 .    in the rest of this paper , our theory is exposed in sections  [ q - of - interest]-[evaluation ] followed by comparison with experiments ( section  [ comparison ] ) and conclusions(section[conclusions ] ) .",
    "central to our treatment is section  [ relation ] , which contains the description of the noise mechanism .",
    "the voltage noise spectrum can be expressed as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the applied voltage , and @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the voltage fluctuation , @xmath13 is the average resistance of the film , and @xmath14 is the equilibrium resistance fluctuation .",
    "the second equality in eq.([cv1 ] ) follows from the assumption of constant current @xmath15 flowing through the film , i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the assumption of constant current is granted , because ( i ) the current noise of external origin is suppressed by a very large resistance connected in series with the film ; and ( ii ) the current noise of `` internal '' origin manifests itself at the equilibrium johnson - nyquist noise@xcite , which was measured independently with zero applied voltage and then subtracted from the spectrum taken with non - zero voltage .",
    "the link between the resistance noise and the voltage noise has also been established experimentally by observing that @xmath18 defined as the difference between the spectra at zero applied voltage and non - zero applied voltage is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "in the following , we consider a somewhat idealized problem of resistance noise coming from a resistivity layer of thickness @xmath20 and volume @xmath21 having uniform material characteristics . because of the band bending , most of the resistance of our actual film originates from the center of the intrinsic layer . the effective thickness of that central layer is@xcite @xmath22 m .    the density of states of undoped a - si : h is characterized by a band gap of @xmath23  ev between the mobility edges @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the valence and conduction bands , respectively .",
    "the defect states , which play an important role in the noise mechanism , are located deep inside the band gap . because of the proximity of the n - layers , the chemical potential @xmath1 is significantly closer to @xmath25 than to @xmath24 .",
    "( from the measurements of the conductivity activation energy , we estimate that @xmath26  ev . ) as a result , the number of electrons in the conduction band is much greater than the number of holes in the valence band , i.e. conduction electrons are the primary carriers of electric current",
    ".    one parameter , which is particularly important for the rest of this work , is @xmath27 , the screening radius of deep defects . in order to estimate it",
    ", we first note that the conventional mechanism of screening by conduction electrons is not operational in our film , because , at the temperatures of experiment , their concentration ( @xmath28 ) is much smaller than the concentration of deep defects ( @xmath29 .",
    "instead , we identify two screening mechanisms : ( i ) by contact layers and ( ii ) by other deep defects . the effective screening radius due to both screening mechanisms was estimated in ref.@xcite as 0.2  @xmath1 m .    in order to simplify the theoretical description",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath30 , i.e. , in this sense , we consider three - dimensional `` bulk '' limit . in our film , @xmath31 .",
    "however , the noise intensity computed with the actual values of @xmath27 and @xmath20 differs from the outcome of the bulk limit calculation only by factor of two@xcite .",
    "we also assume that the film is still thin enough , so that an electron emitted from a deep defect is much more likely to escape into the contact layers than to be captured by another deep defect .",
    "this means that the charges of different deep defects fluctuate independently .",
    "such an assumption is well applicable to the experiments with transverse currents@xcite , because , in these experiments , the contact layers spread over the entire film surface , which means that any defect in the resistivity layer is no more than half of the film thickness away from the contacts .",
    "however , the same assumption is not applicable to the experiments with co - planar currents@xcite , where the distance to contacts is of the order of the in - plane dimensions of the films .",
    "now we describe the fluctuations of the resistivity within the resistivity layer .",
    "these fluctuations arise as a consequence of the fluctuations of the screened coulomb potential @xmath32 created by deep charged defects , known as dangling bonds : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the fluctuation of the @xmath5th defect charge with respect to its average value , @xmath35 the position the defect , @xmath27 the screening radius , and the dielectric constant .",
    "the defects involved may be located outside of the resistivity layer .",
    "when the potential @xmath32 fluctuates , the mobility edge tracks it , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electron charge . since the chemical potential @xmath1 does not shift with @xmath38 , the density of conduction electrons , @xmath39 , re - equilibrates following @xmath40 on the timescale of electron drift from the center of the @xmath5-layer to the @xmath4-layers .",
    "because of the strong band bending inside the @xmath5-layer@xcite , the drift takes less than @xmath41s , i.e. the re - equilibration is effectively instantaneous on the timescales of the noise studied the fluctuating quasi - equilibrium density of the conduction electrons is then proportional to @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "finally , the fluctuating local resistivity @xmath44 , which is is inversely proportional to @xmath39 , can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a proportionality coefficient .",
    "assuming for a moment [ and proving later ] that @xmath47 we expand @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 , the fluctuation of the total resistance ( derived in the appendix ) is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the space inside the resistivity layer ( limited by @xmath54 along the @xmath55-axis and by the edges of the film in the @xmath56-plane ) . substituting @xmath57 and @xmath14 given by eq.([dr ] ) into eq.([cv1 ] ) , and then using eq.([drho1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath58 given eq.([phi ] ) , the correlation function of potential fluctuations can be written as @xmath59 \\label{phiphitr}\\ ] ]    equation ( [ cvphi ] ) should have a very broad range of applicability .",
    "all the material - specific details affect only the evaluation of @xmath60 .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we have performed this evaluation taking into account numerous microscopic characteristics of a - si : h .",
    "below , however , we present a cruder estimate , which is more intuitive and yet reasonably accurate .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath60 in eq.([phiphitr ] ) comes from the correlators of charge fluctuations @xmath61 . for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , because , as discussed in section  [ band ] , the charge fluctuations of different defects are independent of each other .",
    "the non - zero contribution comes from the correlators with @xmath64 , which can be expressed as @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the fluctuation rate of the @xmath5th defect .",
    "the correlator is characterized by a single exponent , because every defect is assumed to have only two states neutral or charged ( with charge either @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) .",
    "the potential fluctuations are induced mainly by the defects , which we call  thermally active \" or simply  active . \"",
    "these active defects have binding energies @xmath69 in the thermal window @xmath70 around the chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "their concentration is , therefore , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the density of defect states around the chemical potential .",
    "it can be estimated as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the total concentration of deep defects , and @xmath75 is the half - width of the distribution of their binding energies .",
    "we have found that in our film@xcite @xmath76 , and @xmath77  ev .    in comparison with the rest of the defects ,",
    "the thermally active ones have the largest amplitude of charge fluctuations .",
    "the absolute value of their charge has roughly the same probability to be 0 or @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , its mean value is @xmath78 , and the mean squared amplitude of fluctuations is @xmath79    now we estimate @xmath60 by taking the average over the spatial distribution of active defects ( assumed to be random ) and over the distribution of their relaxation times ( inverse fluctuation rates ) @xmath80 . for this estimate",
    "we use the following _ ansatz _ : @xmath81 \\   \\int \\hbox{exp } \\left(-{t \\over \\tau } \\right ) \\",

    "in order to escape from a deep defect , an electron should reach the mobility edge @xmath25 . however , the activation barriers @xmath92 ( indicated in fig.[fig1 ] ) can vary as a result of the _ medium - range _ disorder of the amorphous structure ( on a length scale of @xmath93 nm ) .",
    "the activation time of a thermally active defect should then read @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the prefactor of the order of @xmath96  s @xcite .",

    "these were the only two adjustable parameters in our treatment .",
    "we have found that @xmath100  ev ( 0.27 ev above @xmath101 ) , while @xmath102  ev    such an adjustment , however , does not compromise the experimental tests of the theory .",
    "the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 affect the spectral shape but not the integrated noise intensity .",
    "therefore , if the theory predicts a too small noise prefactor , the adjustment of these two parameters only redistributes the spectral intensity in the range of observations but can not make the theoretical spectra agree with the experimental ones . in the next section , we shall proceed with an estimate of the prefactor in front of the ( approximate ) @xmath0 spectral dependence , which is independent of the assumption of the gaussian shape of @xmath103 , but instead relies only on the crude value of @xmath104  ev . since @xmath99 is a characteristics of the energy landscape in a - si : h , one can hardly expect that it has a much different value .",
    "we shall also estimate the integrated noise intensity , which does not depend on the value of @xmath99 at all .",
    "although the idea that the activation barriers should be distributed is very simple , it has not been exploited previously .",
    "one issue here is whether the barriers are long enough or high enough to ensure that the activation processes dominate the tunneling under the potential landscape . given that not much is reliably known about the random potential landscape on the scale of @xmath93 nm , it is only obvious that the relatively high temperatures of experiment favor the activation processes . from our crude theoretical estimates ,",
    "the activation over a barrier , which is 0.3  ev high and 3.5  nm , long starts dominating the tunneling under the same barrier at @xmath105 . for smaller barrier heights or higher temperatures ,",
    "the critical length of the barrier becomes smaller .",
    "however , our main argument in favor of the existence of the distribution of activation barriers is purely empirical :    the mechanism we describe remains perfectly valid , if one assumes that the activation barriers are not distributed at all , i.e. there exists only one activation barrier for all defects : @xmath106 , and , therefore , @xmath107 . in that case",
    ", the theoretical spectral intensity predicted by our treatment would significantly exceed the experimental one in the higher frequency part of the observed spectrum at @xmath105 .",
    "one would then have to explain , how another noise mechanism _ suppresses _ the spectral intensity due to the present one  a task , which seems to be extremely difficult if not impossible .",
    "substituting eq.([cvtau ] ) into eq.([sv ] ) and also using eq.([tau ] ) to switch from integration over @xmath108 to integration over @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath109    since the proximity to the @xmath0 spectral shape results only from the fact that the distribution @xmath103 is much broader than @xmath110 , we obtain the prefactor in front of the @xmath0 dependence by substituting the constant value @xmath111 into eq.([sv1 ] ) , which gives @xmath112 the above estimate can not be applicable to all frequencies , because eq.([peb1 ] ) explicitly violates the normalization condition",
    ". nevertheless , expression ( [ sv2 ] ) constitutes a good approximation in a broad frequency domain around the frequency corresponding to the maximum of the probability distribution @xmath103 .",
    "one can also obtain the integrated noise intensity ( of course , not from the approximation ( [ sv2 ] ) but from eq.([sv1 ] ) ) : @xmath113 if the estimate ( [ d ] ) for @xmath72 is substituted into eqs.([sv1],[sv2 ] ) , then the `` bulk limit '' results obtained from a more accurate description and reported in ref.@xcite can be recovered .",
    "the remarkable fact about expressions ( [ sv2],[svint ] ) is that , even though the noise mechanism rests on the fluctuations of the number of conduction electrons , the resulting spectrum is independent of their equilibrium concentration .",
    "furthermore , the distinct feature of eq.([sv2 ] ) is that the noise prefactor does not depend on temperature .",
    "this should be contrasted with the popular empirical law due to hooge@xcite , according to which the noise prefactor is inversely proportional to the number of ( thermally activated ) carriers and thus decreases exponentially as temperature increases .",
    "as far as the defect characteristics are concerned , then the noise intensity depends only on one of them , namely , @xmath72 , the density of the defect states at the chemical potential .",
    "this dependence is , in fact , weaker than the simple proportionality to @xmath72 , and may even exhibit the opposite trend , because deep defects in undoped a - si : h screen each other , and therefore , the screening radius @xmath27 decreases with the increase of @xmath72 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we present the comparison between the theoretical ( eq.([svint ] ) ) and the experimental values of the integrated noise intensity ( obtained with the numbers given above ) .",
    "since the window of experimental observation does not extend over the infinite range of frequencies , we employed the following extrapolation procedure , which entailed large but quantifiable uncertainties . first , we obtained the lower ends of the error bars by integrating the experimental noise spectra only in the frequency range of the actual experimental observations .",
    "then , the upper ends were obtained by making the power law extrapolations of the spectra beyond the frequency range of observation ( up to @xmath121  hz for small frequencies and @xmath122  hz for large frequencies ) , and then adding the integrals over the extrapolated tails to the lower end values of the error bars .",
