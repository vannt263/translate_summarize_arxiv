    "<S> heat capacity measurements at low temperatures indicate residual structural instability at @xmath4 that extends well into the orthorhombic phase . </S>",
    "<S> the instability is ferroelastic in nature , with density functional theory ( dft ) calculations showing negligible coupling to electronic states near the fermi level . </S>",

    "<S> quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) generate a seemingly inexhaustible supply of new phases of matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although of great interest , the multiple competing phases typically found near a qcp obscure the fundamental critical behavior and consequently a general understanding of such phase transitions has remained elusive and no concept as powerful as the universality of classical continuous phase transitions has emerged . hence , new examples of qcps are highly prized as a means of probing the general organizing principles of qcps . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is rather surprising , given the immense body of work devoted to the study of structural phase transitions at finite temperature , that little attention has been given to the concept of a structural quantum critical point ( sqcp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of previous work on qcps involving structural degrees of freedom has been focused on an incipient ferroelectric state ( _ e.g. _ refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ) for example , the quantum zero point motion in srtio@xmath5 acts to prevent the complete softening of the relevant optic phonon mode resulting in a quantum paraelectric on the verge of ferroelectricity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , interest in sqcps has risen . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , scf@xmath5 has been discussed as an example of an sqcp in an ionic insulator @xcite . on the other hand , in metallic systems , </S>",
    "<S> there have been several studies of a family of rameika phase stannides where a structural phase transition with concomitant changes in the fermi surface can be tuned to an sqcp @xcite . here , we approach the problem of an sqcp from the perspective of a structural phase transition where elastic instabilities are primarily responsible for the lowering of symmetry and electronic degrees of freedom are unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> this type of transition is similar to the nematic transition , as found , for example in the fe - based superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity being that the point group symmetry is lowered without a change in translational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the two cases are nevertheless distinct , as in the fe - based superconductors , the nematic transition is strongly coupled to electronic states near the fermi level , whereas the elastic transition studied here is in the opposite decoupled limit .    </S>",
    "<S> elastic qcps , where the quantum zero point motion of the atoms destroys an elastically ordered state , have been the subject of recent theoretical study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , examples where electronic degrees of freedom are uninvolved have , to the best of our knowledge , eluded study thus far . to remedy this , </S>",

    "<S> the continuous nature of the orthorhombic - monoclinic phase transition is evidenced by : a smooth evolution of the monoclinic distortion @xcite ; a gradual softening of the @xmath10 elastic constant @xcite ; a progressive softening of a transverse acoustic phonon mode @xcite ; and a continuous change in the linear thermal expansion coefficient @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , no signature of the structural phase transition is visible in resistivity measurements @xcite , suggesting that the electronic degrees of freedom are of little consequence . </S>",
    "<S> finally , among the different members of the @xmath9cu@xmath6 family , the absence of unpaired @xmath11electrons in lacu@xmath6 eliminates complications due to a magnetic ground state .    in this letter </S>",

    "<S> our electronic structure calculations indicate that the latter is the case in lacu@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon softening calculated by dft is in line with the softening of the transverse acoustic mode observed in cecu@xmath6 and lacu@xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is continuous and originates from a zone center elastic instability , and may thus be termed ferroelastic , although we have not observed switching in the low - t phase and therefore formally it is coelastic @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> similar to the prior calculations @xcite , the cu @xmath39-bands are occupied and are located from approximately -5 @xmath40 to -1.7 @xmath40 with respect to @xmath41 and therefore do not play a role in the low energy physics , which instead depends on an electronic structure derived mainly from cu and la @xmath42states . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface is derived from five bands that cross @xmath41 and is similar in both two phases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated plasma frequencies(@xmath43 ) for the orthorhombic phase are 3.00 @xmath40 , 3.03 @xmath40 and 3.61 @xmath40 along @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level density of states is very similar between the two phases : @xmath44 = 3.52 @xmath45 and 3.37 @xmath45 per formula unit for the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases , respectively .        </S>",
    "<S> thus the electronic structure of orthorhombic and monoclinic lacu@xmath6 are very similar to each other in all respects , including the electronic structure near @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the phase transition is not driven electronically , @xmath46 by an instability of the fermi surface such as a density wave , as there is no substantial reconstruction of the electronic structure associated with the transition . </S>",
    "<S> it also implies that the structural transition does not couple strongly to electrons at the fermi energy , meaning that only weak effects in transport and other electronic properties may be expected . </S>",
    "<S> together the unstable transverse acoustic branch along @xmath36 and the decoupled electronic degrees of freedom are consistent with a ferroelastic ground state in lacu@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the variations of the transition temperature upon substitution on the la and cu site are consistent with the characterization of the transition as a ferroelastic transition driven by size effects , specifically , substitution of a larger atom on the cu site behaves similar to the substitution of a smaller atom on the la site @xcite , making a connection between the instability and size mismatch , as opposed to chemical pressure , band - width , @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> having determined that the structural transition is elastic in origin and that the electronic degrees of freedom are unimportant , we now examine the thermodynamic properties with heat capacity measurements . typically at a qcp , the energy scale associated with the critical fluctuations vanishes resulting in an enhanced heat capacity as the qcp is approached  the softening of the transverse acoustic mode discussed above plays this role here . </S>",
    "<S> as anticipated , a larger heat capacity is observed at the putative qcp in lacu@xmath0au@xmath13  ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> the relation , @xmath48 was utilized to parametrize the low temperature heat capacity for each composition , where the coefficients , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , represent the electronic and phonon contributions , respectively @xcite . as shown in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ heat_capacity](b , c ) , @xmath50 reaches a maximum value at @xmath4 , while @xmath49 remains essentially independent of au - composition . </S>",
    "<S> the modest increase in the phonon heat capacity at @xmath4 is in line with the softening of the acoustic mode along @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the softening of a single acoustic mode is a small contribution to @xmath50 which contains contributions from all thermally accessible phonon modes . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath50 is elevated for compositions larger than @xmath4 , that is the orthorhombic region of the phase diagram directly adjacent to the qcp . </S>",
    "<S> measurements which directly probe the unstable acoustic mode would be particularly useful to further illuminate this issue .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the ( ca@xmath1sr@xmath51)@xmath5rh@xmath52sn@xmath53 @xcite and the ( ca@xmath1sr@xmath51)@xmath5ir@xmath52sn@xmath53 @xcite series have been identified as systems that can be tuned to a displacive sqcp by application of physical or chemical pressure . in an intriguing analogy with many unconventional superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams of these systems comprise a dome of superconductivity peaked near an sqcp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the structural phase transition in these systems occurs with an abrupt change in the fermi surface associated with a charge density wave @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , there is a clear distinction with the qcp in lacu@xmath0au@xmath1 where there is no expectation ( or evidence ) that electronic degrees of freedom play an important role or are affected in a significant way . </S>",
    "<S> also , an elastic qcp is associated with an instability of a acoustic mode rather than an optic mode as in the case of displacive sqcp . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there are some similarities , for example , the phonon specific heat is enhanced near the sqcp in lacu@xmath0au@xmath1 and somewhat more dramatically in the stannides mentioned above @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations indicate that the elastic qcp studied here is fundamentally different from the displacive sqcp and the lacu@xmath0au@xmath13  series appears to be an ideal candidate system to further probe an elastic qcp without the complications of competing electronic phases .    in conclusion </S>",

    "<S> = 0.3 was constructed from the results of x - ray and neutron diffraction measurements . the low - temperature phonon contribution to the heat capacity rises at the critical composition , indicating residual instability of the orthorhombic structure at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these observations indicate that the suppression of the monoclinic phase with au - substitution in lacu@xmath0au@xmath1 likely results in a qcp . </S>",
    "<S> dft calculations support the idea that the qcp in lacu@xmath0au@xmath1 arises from an elastic instability with no significant involvement of electronic degrees of freedom . </S>",
