    "x - ray pulsars , typically , have hard spectra and a broad range of observed spin periods ( 2  ms  3  hr ) .",
    "there is , however , a group of at least 5 x - ray pulsars ( 4u  0142@xmath961 , 1e  1048.1@xmath105937 , 1rxs  j170849@xmath1040091 , 1e  1841@xmath10045 , 1e  2259@xmath9586 ) that have characteristics similar to one another , but distinct from those known to be accreting binary pulsars",
    ". the existence of this class of pulsars , dubbed the ` anomalous x - ray pulsars ' ( axps ) , was first identified as such 6 years ago @xcite .",
    "axp characteristics include : ( i ) predominantly constant x - ray luminosities of order @xmath11 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath13 ; ( ii ) relatively soft , two - component x - ray spectra ( blackbody @xmath14 0.5 kev ; power - law photon indices @xmath11",
    "2.5@xmath104 ) ; ( iii ) small galactic scale height ( @xmath15 56 pc ) ;",
    "( iv ) association of 2 out of 5 ( 1e  1841@xmath10045 , 1e  2259@xmath9586 ) with young ( @xmath11 10@xmath16 year ) supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite ; ( v ) pulse periods within a narrow range ( 5  12 s ) ; ( vi ) rapid , nearly constant spin - down rates ( @xmath17 s s@xmath13 ) ; and ( vii ) no clear evidence for a binary companion filling its roche lobe ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "1e  2259 + 586  was discovered by gregory & fahlman ( 1980 ) and lies along the line of sight of an x - ray and radio bright galactic supernova remnant g109.1 - 1.0  ( ctb 109 ) @xcite .",
    "there is no accurate distance measurement for the snr ; @xcite and @xcite have estimated distances of 4.1 and 5.6  kpc , respectively , using the surface brightness - diameter relation in different wave bands .",
    "the x - ray properties of 1e  2259 + 586  ( and the associated snr g109.1 - 1.0 ) have been investigated using _",
    "bepposax _ , _ rosat _ , _ bbxrt _ , and _ asca _  @xcite .",
    "the pulsar spectrum has often been described as an absorbed powerlaw ( pl ) with a photon spectral index of @xmath18 and a blackbody ( bb ) component with a characteristic temperature of @xmath1@xmath19  kev with galactic absorption column density of @xmath3=@xmath20  @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the best previous position for 1e  2259 + 586  was @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( j2000 ) with a @xmath24 confidence error radius of @xmath25 established by @xcite using _ rosat _  hri observations .",
    "they found no optical counterpart with the keck , down to limiting magnitudes of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite set an upper limit with the vla to the 1.5  ghz flux of @xmath28 .",
    "we present here an analysis of our _ chandra _  observation of the source . in ",
    "[ sec : obsresults ] we describe the observations and present imaging , timing and spectral results .",
    "the analysis and derivation of a new precise position of @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( j2000 ) with a @xmath31 confidence error radius of @xmath32 , together with the k - band identification of 1e  2259 + 586 is discussed in the companion paper by @xcite .",
    "1e  2259 + 586  was observed on 11 january 2000 using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "data were collected sequentially in two different observing modes : timed exposure ( te ) mode ( 19 ks ) and continuous clocking ( cc ) mode ( 12 ks ) .",
    "data obtained in te mode allow for two - dimensional imaging .",
    "accurate spectroscopy of the bright pulsating target is limited due to pulse pile up .",
    "pulse - phased spectroscopy is further limited by the 3.24  s time resolution . in cc mode",
    "the amount of pileup is negligible due to its 2.85 ms time resolution , allowing for both accurate time integrated and phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "furthermore , one can exploit the one - dimensional image to search for extension of the central source .",
    "the source was positioned on the nominal target position of acis - s3 , a back illuminated ccd on the spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) with good charge transfer efficiency and spectral resolution @xcite .",
    "in addition to s3 , four front illuminated ccds were active ( i2 , i3 , s2 and s4 , see also figure  [ fig : chanimage ] ) .",
    "the focal plane operating temperature was @xmath33  c.    standard processing of the data was performed by the _ chandra _   x - ray center .",
    "the data were filtered to exclude events with _ asca _",
    "grades 1 , 5 , and 7 , hot pixels , bad columns , and events on ccd node boundaries .",
    "we removed the serial clocking noise streaks from s4 using the _ destreak _ program .",
    "we examined the processed data and found no times with bad aspect .",
    "the s3 light curve was inspected in a region offset from the axp to identify periods of high background rates : we removed segments where the background exceeded a @xmath34 threshold about the mean .",
    "the resulting useful observing times are 15600  s and 9000  s for te and cc mode data , respectively .",
    "searching for extended emission in the vicinity of 1e  2259 + 586  was difficult .",
    "one must account for numerous contributions to the observed flux .",
    "these contributions include not only the bright source itself and the instrumental background , but also the snr , stars in the field , and diffuse emission from the galactic plane .",
    "one must also account for the possibility of a dust scattering halo and/or an x - ray nebula .    to avoid issues related to the effects of pileup in the te mode data",
    ", we first utilized the one dimensional image from the cc mode .",
    "we generated a time - integrated image ( @xmath5 kev ) minus any point sources other than 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "we then subtracted an average count rate intended to remove instrumental and cosmic diffuse x - ray background , as measured by s3 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "next , we constructed what will be referred to as the `` pulsed '' image .",
    "we took the observed pulse profile , normalized it to a mean of zero and convolved it with the event list of s3 .",
    "each count recorded on s3 was assigned a phase .",
    "events with a phase near pulse maximum , regardless of their position on the chip , received a positive weight and likewise , those near pulse minimum , a negative weight . in doing so",
    ", we remove all emission components in our image that do not vary in phase ( i.e. , everything except the central pulsar ) .",
    "note that the time delay for photons scattered by the interstellar dust is on average minutes , much longer than the pulsar period .    to improve statistics , we folded the one - dimensional images about the common centroid and accumulated `` quasi - radial '' profiles .",
    "the time - integrated ( cc@xmath35 ) and pulsed ( cc@xmath36 ) profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : radprof ] . we find that the pulsed radial profile is consistent with the marx ( * ? ? ? * v3.01 ) derived point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "next , we collapsed the te mode observation to mimic the 1-d cc image ( figure  [ fig : radprof ] , te ) .",
    "we find that the te profile completely overlaps the cc@xmath35 profile beyond @xmath37 , marking the radius beyond which the effects of pile - up are negligible . in both profiles",
    "we find excess emission beyond @xmath37 which is likely due to the combination of the underlying snr , a dust - scattering halo and potentially an x - ray plerion .",
    "we conclude that the majority of the 1e  2259 + 586  x - ray flux is contained within a radius of @xmath38 .",
    "inspection of the spectra extracted from s3 in five annuli , centered on the pulsar position , and with inner and outer radii of @xmath39 , indicates the presence of continuum radiation in the vicinity of the pulsar .",
    "detailed modeling of the angular and spectral distribution is underway for an accurate accounting of the light , to establish the relative contributions from the snr , dust scattered light from the pulsar , and any possible plerionic emission .",
    "this work will be presented elsewhere .",
    "high resolution timing with acis is only possible using cc - mode data . the cc mode event times denote when the event was read out of the frame store , not when it was detected .",
    "we corrected for this effect by assuming that all photons were originally detected at the nominal target position .",
    "we removed the variable time delay due to spacecraft dither and telescope flexure using the acis cc mode absolute time corrector .",
    "the event arrival times were then corrected to the solar system barycenter using _ axbary _ which utilizes the jpl planetary ephemeris de-200 .",
    "the data were divided into ten @xmath40  s intervals and individual pulse profiles were derived using epoch folding .",
    "these ten profiles were compared to the pulse profile using all the data and the relative phases were fit with a linear function .",
    "the resulting pulse period of @xmath41  s is referred to epoch mjd 51555.0 .",
    "this period is consistent with the spin history of the source @xcite .",
    "the pulse profile is shown in figure  [ fig : foldevents]a ; the 0.5@xmath107.0 kev background subtracted peak - to - peak pulse fraction , as defined in @xcite , is @xmath42 .",
    "previously , @xcite have established limits as to the existence of a binary companion .",
    "they concluded that a putative companion must be a white dwarf or a he - burning star with @xmath43 ( for a companion star filling its roche lobe ) .",
    "we have also searched for evidence of binarity . binning the data in 50 s intervals ,",
    "a total of 177 pulse profiles were cross - correlated to the average pulse profile , and pulse phase offsets were determined .",
    "we then searched for the sinusoidal signature of a circular binary orbit , for periods ranging from 100 to @xmath44  s using the method described by @xcite .",
    "we found no evidence for binarity and set a @xmath31 confidence limit of @xmath45  lt - ms for orbital periods in the range from 170 to 5000  s ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "we use cc mode data to obtain an x - ray spectrum .",
    "we assume that the cc and te spectral responses are identical . to test this assumption ,",
    "we compared low count rate data from a particular region in both cc and te mode and found reasonable agreement .",
    "we define the source by selecting an interval @xmath46 pixels ( @xmath47 ) ( see also  [ sec : extended ] ) around the peak flux along the collapsed cc mode axis .",
    "the background was determined using two adjacent segments 12 pixels wide for a total area 1.5 times the source area ; the background flux provides @xmath48 of the total flux in the source region . source and background spectra and response files",
    "were generated using the ciao ( v2.1.1 ) tools _ dmextract _ , _ mkrmf _ , and _",
    "mkarf_. the extraction was performed in pulse invariant ( pi ) space ( _ i.e. _ , after the instrument gains were applied ) .",
    "the spectrum was grouped into bins that contained at least 25 events .",
    "all spectral fits were limited to the @xmath5  kev band and use xspecv11.01 @xcite , the photo - electric absorption coefficients of @xcite , and abundances of @xcite .",
    "we fit the data to a pl+bb model ( @xmath49 ) ; the fit is significantly improved ( @xmath50 ) by ignoring the 1.9 - 2.1 kev band , which contains the iridium - edge structure in the telescope response .",
    "the best fit pl+bb parameters are @xmath51 , @xmath1@xmath52  kev , and @xmath3@xmath53 , consistent with the same model results of @xcite . assuming a source distance of 4  kpc , the 2 - 10 kev unabsorbed flux and x - ray luminosity are @xmath54  ergs  s@xmath13  @xmath21 and @xmath55  ergs  s@xmath13 respectively .",
    "the pl component contributes @xmath56 of the total 2 - 10 kev unabsorbed flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : avespec ] shows the data , the best - fit model , and the residuals .",
    "we have also investigated single component pl , bb , and bremsstrahlung ( bs ) models and a combined pl+bs model and found that they are all statistically unacceptable at @xmath57 and @xmath58 confidence levels , respectively .",
    "we have searched for spectral lines .",
    "features that appear below @xmath59  kev and in the ir edge , are likely due to uncertainty in the spectral response .",
    "to set upper limits , we examined two small deviations at 0.7 and 5.0  kev .",
    "the addition of a line , modeled by a gaussian with an intrinsic width of 40 ev at 5.0 kev to the pl+bb model , results in an f statistic of 3.3 ; the @xmath60 confidence upper limit on the line flux is @xmath61  ergs  @xmath21  s@xmath13 .",
    "similarly , including a `` line '' at 0.7 kev gives an f statistic of 1.3 .",
    "we conclude that there are no significant line features .",
    "we fit the data from each of the ten pulse phase bins ( figure [ fig : foldevents ] ) with a pl+bb model parameters free to obtain their best fit values and with @xmath3  constrained to be identical at each phase .",
    "the fitting gave a column density of @xmath62 ( and is identical to the time averaged value found in ",
    "[ sec : axpspec1 ] ) . for the remaining fits , @xmath3",
    "is constrained to be identical at each phase ( i.e. , linked ) .",
    "we next fit all phase bins with @xmath1  constrained to be identical at each phase and allow @xmath63 and the normalizations to vary .",
    "the decrease in @xmath64 was not significant indicating the fits were statistically equivalent .",
    "however , there were significant variations in @xmath63 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the fits were repeated with @xmath63 constrained with respect to phase and with @xmath1  and normalizations allowed to vary .",
    "again this resulted in a statistically equivalent fit but with significant variations of @xmath1  ( @xmath66  kev ) .",
    "the evolution of spectral parameters is shown as a function of pulse phase in figures  [ fig : foldevents]b and [ fig : foldevents]c .",
    "we fit the spectra with @xmath1  and @xmath63 constrained to be identical at each phase with only the normalizations free to vary with phase and find that the fits are not statistically equivalent .",
    "these results indicate that there is marginal ( @xmath67 ) evidence for evolution in either @xmath63 , @xmath1 or some combination thereof with phase , but we are unable to determine which .",
    "finally , we impose an additional constraint where the ratio of the pl and bb model normalizations ( pl@xmath68 , bb@xmath69 ) are constant .",
    "our fits show no statistical improvement in complicating the model by allowing the normalizations to be independent .",
    "fit statistics for the models discussed are given in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we have observed the anomalous x - ray pulsar , 1e  2259 + 586  with _ chandra _  and determined a new , precise position of the source of @xmath70 , @xmath30 ( j2000 ) with a @xmath31 confidence error radius of @xmath32 .",
    "we report in the accompanying paper @xcite the details of the derivation , which led to the identification of a near infrared ( nir ) counterpart at the _ chandra _  position .",
    "this is the second axp counterpart to be found in nir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we find that of the spectral models we have considered , the pl@xmath9bb one is statistically preferred for the pulsar spectrum . in addition , the superb _ chandra _  spatial resolution allows us to determine that there is emission extending up to @xmath8 from the pulsar , but we are unable to determine its precise origin - whether from the supernova remnant , and/or a dust scattering halo , and/or a plerion .",
