    "a fundamental question is _ well - posedness _ : which initial values give rise to unique nonnegative solutions that depend continuously on the data ?",

    "what conditions are they stable , do they attract all bounded solutions , and what is the rate of convergence ?",
    "since energy decreases along solutions , we expect that steady states should correspond to critical points of the energy , that solutions should converge to steady states , and that minimizers of the energy should be asymptotically stable",

    "there also has been some progress on thin film equations with @xmath19 , where the metric is just the standard optimal transportation distance  @xcite .",
    "thin - film equations with @xmath34 have proved resistant to this approach , because the geometry of the relevant wasserstein distance with mobility is not well understood , and the thin film energy is not geodesically convex  @xcite .",
