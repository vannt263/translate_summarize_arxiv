    "electron scattering by the simplest polyatomic ion h@xmath2 is of fundamental importance in plasma physics because @xmath0 ions are dominant in many hydrogen - containing plasmas , including astrophysically - relevant plasmas in particular .",
    "for quantum theory , the electron - h@xmath2 interaction is important because the process involves the simplest polyatomic ion that can be studied from first principles without adjustable parameters . in the long history of research on recombination of @xmath0 with an electron",
    "there have been numerous exciting , contradictory and sometimes unaccepted results .",
    "we mention here only a few recent reviews devoted to h@xmath2 recombination at low temperatures ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a successful theory of @xmath0 recombination with electrons at scattering energies below 1 ev was developed relatively recently when the jahn - teller non - born - oppenheimer coupling was included into theory @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the recombination rate constant in different storage ring experiments have also converged to the same value recently , after it became understood that the internal rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the h@xmath2 ion influence the recombination rate @xcite .",
    "the theoretical developments and improvements in storage ring experiments have resulted in a reconciliation of theory and experiment for the binary electron - h@xmath2 recombination process",
    ".    however , the @xmath0 and @xmath3 recombination experiments carried out in afterglow plasmas @xcite have repeatedly given rate coefficients very different from the ones obtained in the aforementioned storage ring experiments and the theoretical calculations . until now ,",
    "the plasma studies have not been fully understood and , as a result , they have been frequently rejected because they do not mesh with the present understanding of the binary dr process ( see , e.g. , the very recent review discussing this subject @xcite ) .",
    "however , the experimental plasma results are reproducible and they demand an understanding and an integration into the full picture of h@xmath2 recombination with electrons .",
    "the present work discusses and , we hope , clarifies some aspects of this complex problem .",
    "the plasma measurements are usually carried out in a he / ar/@xmath4 gas mixture ( see the review by plasil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) or in a pure @xmath4 gas @xcite .",
    "the main question is how to `` reconcile '' @xcite the rate constant ( including its dependence on experimental conditions ) observed in an @xmath0 dominated plasma with actual theory and with data from the storage ring experiments @xcite .",
    "the plasma experiments are typically carried out with helium buffer gas at pressures in the range 502000 pa .",
    "it has been generally accepted that such pressures are too small to produce appreciable ternary helium - assisted recombination of h@xmath2 .",
    "the fact that the neutral - stabilized recombination can sometimes play a role was predicted many years ago by bates and khare @xcite and confirmed for some ions ( but not for @xmath0 ) by experiments @xcite .",
    "the typical value for the three - body recombination rate coefficient @xmath5 with helium as an ambient gas obtained in experiment and estimated theoretically @xcite is of order of @xmath6 at 300  k. thus , at pressures of 1300  pa , the corresponding apparent binary recombination rate coefficient is smaller than @xmath7 , which would therefore be negligible in comparison with the now - accepted binary h@xmath8 recombination rate coefficient @xcite .",
    "this would also be negligible in comparison with the binary rate coefficients ( about @xmath9 at 300  k ) for the majority of molecular ions .",
    "this is the reason why the ternary recombination of @xmath0 had previously been neglected in falp ( flowing afterglow ) and sa ( stationary afterglow ) experiments carried out at 502000 pa .    in our recent study",
    "@xcite we have shown that at 260  k a significant fraction of the h@xmath2 + e@xmath10 collisions leads to formation of long - lived ( up to tens of picoseconds ) rotationally - excited neutral rydberg molecules @xmath1 .",
    "the formation of long - lived @xmath1 and collisions of @xmath1 with helium atoms can influence the overall process of recombination of the @xmath0 dominated afterglow plasma . by measuring the helium pressure dependence of the @xmath0 recombination rate coefficient we have found that at 260  k the ternary recombination rate is comparable with the binary rate , already at pressures of several hundred pa .",
    "the observed ternary recombination of @xmath0 ions is more efficient by a factor of 100 than the ternary recombination rate predicted by bates and khare @xcite .",
    "this suggests that ternary recombination of @xmath0 ions is associated with intrinsic features of the interaction between @xmath0 and electrons at low collision energies @xcite .",
    "the recombination process described by bates @xcite is a ternary process of a different nature .",
    "this study presents a further extension of our measurements to a broader range of temperatures and it extracts the temperature dependence of the binary and ternary recombination rate coefficients of @xmath0 ions . before presenting these new results and their interpretation , some of us ( the prague group ) wish to provide a few comments concerning the plasma experiments made in prague in recent years .",
    "previously , we have studied the @xmath0 recombination in decaying plasmas formed from a he / ar/@xmath4 gas mixture using several afterglow experiments based on several modifications of flowing and stationary afterglow apparatuses ( falp @xcite , aisa  advanced integrated stationary afterglow @xcite , tdt - crds  test discharge tube with cavity ring - down spectroscopy @xcite ) .",
    "we have systematically investigated the dependence of the recombination process on hydrogen partial pressure . initially",
    "( in 2000 ) , our intention was to explain the influence of the internal excitation of @xmath0 ions formed in a sequence of ion - molecule reactions on the measured recombination rate coefficient .",
    "experimental conditions were such that the plasma was decaying for a long time ( up to 60 ms ) , so the internal excitation was quenched in collisions with he and @xmath4 . as a rule",
    ", we skip the first 10 ms of the decay process considering it as a formation time . at low @xmath4 densities ,",
    "@xmath11 < 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ ] , and helium pressures of 100300  pa , we have observed a decrease of the recombination rate coefficient from @xmath12@xmath13s@xmath14 to @xmath15@xmath13s@xmath14 when the @xmath4 density was decreased from @xmath16 to @xmath17 . at high hydrogen densities , @xmath11 > 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ ] , the measured recombination rate coefficient was independent of @xmath11 $ ]",
    ". we will consider this again below when discuss equilibrium conditions for recombining h@xmath2 plasma .",
    "a similar dependence on @xmath18 density was observed in a d@xmath2-dominated afterglow plasma ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in our early experimental publications @xcite",
    ", we derived the recombination rate coefficient from experimental measurements assuming that the process is strictly binary ( h@xmath2 + e@xmath10 ) at the low - pressure limit .",
    "the assumption was based on the then - existing level of knowledge about h@xmath2 recombination ( see the recent and older reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , we soon realized that the observed dependence on hydrogen density is coupled to the multistep character of the recombination process in a plasma .",
    "the theory of binary dissociative recombination of h@xmath2 is more immediately applicable to the storage ring experiments .",
    "therefore we denoted the plasma recombination rate constant as an effective deionization rate constant @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "later experiments using absorption spectroscopy for ion density measurements and for the identification of the recombining ions ( tdt - crds ) @xcite did not clarify the mechanism of recombination in an afterglow plasma .",
    "the interpretation of data from storage ring @xcite experiments and from afterglow @xcite experiments was at this point not reconciled @xcite .",
    "we stress here one principal difference between the two types of experiments : in a storage ring experiment , the recombining ions and electrons have a small adjustable relative velocity ; the measured cross - section corresponds to the binary electron - ion recombination process . in a plasma experiment",
    "an ambient gas must be used .",
    "typically , the pressure of the ambient gas in the afterglow experiments is 502000 pa .",
    "the ions and electrons in afterglow plasma undergo multiple collisions with neutral particles ( he and @xmath4 in the experiments discussed here ) prior to their mutual collisions ; these are collisions at low energy ( around @xmath20 ) . in a storage ring ,",
    "collisions of h@xmath2 with neutral particles are also possible , but when an ion collides with a background gas molecule or atom , it is removed from the beam and does not contribute any further to the observable recombination events @xcite .",
    "plasma experiments measure the thermally averaged rate constant .",
    "it means that the afterglow plasma should ideally be in thermal equilibrium with respect to all degrees of freedom , in particular with respect to the rotational , vibrational and nuclear spin states of h@xmath2 .",
    "molecular hydrogen present in the recombining plasma equilibrates the ortho / para - h@xmath2 ratio and should make the `` kinetic '' temperature of ions and electrons to coincide with the he temperature @xcite .",
    "an internal excitation of @xmath0 ions obtained in the process of h@xmath2 formation @xcite is also quenched in collisions with he atoms , but the population of the lowest energy levels ( lowest ortho and para - states ) is governed by collisions with h@xmath21 .",
    "one has to have in mind that proton transfer reactions ( from @xmath22 or @xmath23 to @xmath4 ) producing @xmath0 occur at nearly the rate of elastic collisions , but the rate coefficients for reactions between @xmath0 and @xmath4 , which change ortho-@xmath0 to para-@xmath0 and vice versa ( `` state changing collisions '' ) are a factor of 510 smaller , @xmath24 ( see refs .",
    "if recombination of @xmath0 is sensitive to the nuclear spin state of @xmath0 then recombination drives the @xmath0 ions out of ortho / para thermal equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , the `` state - changing collisions '' with @xmath4 shift the ortho / para @xmath0 distribution towards the thermal equilibrium . in this case ,",
    "thermal equilibrium means a population of rotational states corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium at the given temperature .",
    "note that we have already demonstrated that in a plasma at 260  k the recombination of ortho and para-@xmath0 ions is very different @xcite .",
    "the recombination frequency ( number of events per unit time ) is @xmath25 and the `` state changing frequency '' is @xmath26 $ ]",

    "n_{\\rm e}$ ] .",
    "if values typical for falp experiments ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) are used in this inequality , we obtain the condition on the hydrogen density : @xmath11 > 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ ] .",
    "this is an important density value for the interpretation of data in the plasma experiments ( see also the definition of the rate coefficient in plasma as it is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "it is presumably not accidental that the density @xmath31@xmath32 is the same as the density at which the measured effective @xmath0 recombination rate coefficient changes its character .",
    "we have in mind that at temperatures below 300 k @xmath33 and @xmath19 are dependent on rotational excitation ( ortho and para states ) of @xmath4 and @xmath0 than also the condition for thermal equilibrium is more complex .",
    "we will come to this point again later .    because a recombining plasma contains neutral molecules and atoms ,",
    "collisions between ions and electrons are perturbed by the neutral particles , which can influence the observed effective plasma recombination rate .",
    "the perturbation could be significant if in a electron - ion collision a long - lived highly excited intermediate neutral molecule is formed ( see the discussion in refs .",
    "if the third particle is an atom from the buffer gas , the probability of such a collision is proportional to its pressure and , as a consequence , the apparent recombination rate coefficient will be pressure dependent .",
    "similar phenomena are well known from studies of ion - molecule association reactions , which can have a binary ( e.g. radiative association ) and/or three - body character depending on the lifetime of the complex .",
    "the rate of these processes can depend on pressure and temperature ( e.g. associative reactions , see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "third - body perturbation of h@xmath2 binary recombination in a plasma was already mentioned in our recent study @xcite . in the present study , we show further experimental evidence for the phenomenon and further aspects of the theoretical interpretation , in conjunction with numerical calculation .    the rest of the article is organized in as follows .",
    "first , we briefly describe the experiments in section [ sec : exps ] .",
    "then we present new experimental results in section [ sec : exp_res ] , where we interpret the observed dependencies of the apparent binary recombination rate coefficients ( @xmath19 ) on hydrogen and helium pressure , and from that analysis , derive the binary and ternary recombination rate coefficients .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : theory ] we introduce our theoretical description of ternary recombination of an h@xmath2 plasma , present our calculation of the lifetimes of the long - lived neutral molecules @xmath1 formed in the electron - ion collisions , and estimate the rate coefficient for the ternary channel of h@xmath2 recombination .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "for measurements of pressure and temperature dependences of the @xmath0 recombination rate we have built the cryo - falp apparatus , designed to operate in the range 77300 k and at helium pressures adjustable from @xmath34 to @xmath35 pa .",

    "there is a qualitative difference between measured and calculated values of the ternary rate coefficient : the experimental rate constant decreases with temperature , the theoretical one continues to grow .",
    "it is possible that at low temperature ortho and para - h@xmath2 ion are not in thermal equilibrium in this afterglow plasma because of the very different binary rate constants @xmath170 that have been predicted for low temperatures .",

    "<S> we study binary and the recently discovered process of ternary he - assisted recombination of @xmath0 ions with electrons in a low temperature afterglow plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments are carried out over a broad range of pressures and temperatures of an afterglow plasma in a helium buffer gas . </S>",
    "<S> binary and he - assisted ternary recombination are observed and the corresponding recombination rate coefficients are extracted for temperatures from 77  k to 330  k. we describe the observed ternary recombination as a two - step mechanism : first , a rotationally - excited long - lived neutral molecule @xmath1 is formed in electron-@xmath0 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> second , the @xmath1 molecule collides with a helium atom that leads to the formation of a very long - lived rydberg state with high orbital momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we present calculations of the lifetimes of @xmath1 and of the ternary recombination rate coefficients for para and ortho-@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations show a large difference between the ternary recombination rate coefficients of ortho and para-@xmath0 at temperatures below 300  k. the measured binary and ternary rate coefficients are in reasonable agreement with the calculated values . </S>"
