    "the discovery in recent years of many isolated neutron stars ( nss ) at the centers of supernova remnants ( snrs ) confirms the long - held notion that these ultra - dense stellar remnants are born in supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "most of these nss are identified as pulsars , whose emission derives either from rotational energy loss , as for the rapidly spinning pulsars in the crab ( @xmath14  ms ) and vela ( @xmath15  ms ) remnants , or from magnetic field decay , as posited for the slower ( @xmath16  s ) anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and related objects ( see mereghetti 2000 for a review ) .",
    "however , the nature of a small but growing collection of young ( @xmath17  yrs ) nss in snrs remains a mystery .",
    "these so - called compact central objects ( ccos ) are seemingly isolated nss , distinguished by their steady flux , predominantly thermal emission , lack of optical or radio counterparts , and absence of a surrounding pulsar wind nebula ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the six firm examples of ccos are the central x - ray sources discovered in cas  a @xcite , pup  a @xcite , g347.3@xmath180.5 @xcite , pks  120951/52 @xcite , g266.21.2 @xcite , and kes  79 @xcite .",
    "their luminosities range over @xmath19 erg  s@xmath1 , typical of the younger pulsars ; however their spectra are best characterized as hot blackbody emission of @xmath20  kev , rather than by power - law models .",
    "this is significantly hotter than radio pulsars or other radio - quiet nss ( rqnss ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but similar to the thermal component of the more luminous axps / sgrs .",
    "distinct from the rest , psr  j12105226 in pks  120951/52 is a @xmath21  ms pulsar @xcite that displays large deviations in its spin - down rate , a softer spectrum of @xmath22  kev , and cyclotron resonance lines @xcite .",
    "these properties suggest that psr  j12105226 is variously a wide - binary system , a strongly glitching ns , or an accretor from fall - back material @xcite .",
    "is the recently discovered cco in supernova remnant kes  79 ( g33.6@xmath230.1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the distance to this unresolved _ chandra _  source is estimated as @xmath24  kpc , derived from and oh absorption studies @xcite and updated using the galactic rotation curves of @xcite .",
    "its x - ray luminosity all but rules out any late - type star , and the spectral slope ( photon index @xmath25 ; @xcite ) nominally eliminates an agn origin .",
    "the steady flux disfavors an accreting binary origin for the x - ray emission , and the absence of a wind nebula argues against an energetic rotation - powered pulsar . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of 105  ms pulsations from the cco associated with , with an upper limit on the period derivative , and we consider possible interpretations of its timing and spectral properties .",
    "we leave the analysis of the snr to a subsequent paper .",
    "the central source in  was observed twice with the _ newton x - ray multi - mirror mission _ ( _ xmm - newton _ ) on 2004 october 18 and 23 .",
    "we analyze data from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ; @xcite ) , which consists of three ccd imagers , epic  pn and two epic  moss .",
    "these detectors are sensitive to x - rays in the nominal @xmath26  kev range .",
    "the epic  pn was operated in `` small window '' mode with a @xmath27 field - of - view ( fov ) and 5.7  ms time resolution that allows a search for even the most rapidly rotating pulsar .",
    "the target was placed at the default epic  pn focal plane location for a point source .",
    "the epic  mos data were obtained in `` full frame '' mode with a @xmath28 diameter fov to image the diffuse supernova remnant emission and its environment .",
    "the time resolution in this mode is 2.7  s. for all three cameras the medium density filter was used .",
    "we processed the data with science analysis system version sas 6.0.0 ( 20040318_1831 ) , and screened the photon event lists using the standard filter criteria .",
    "both observations were uncontaminated by flare events and provided 30.5  ks of good epic  pn exposure time during each epoch . after taking into account the ccd readout dead - time ( 29% ) , this translates to 21.6  ks of live - time per observation in `` small window '' mode .",
    "each epic  mos provided nearly 31  ks of good exposure time per observation with no dead - time . in all cases ,",
    "the source count rates were too low for pile - up effects to be significant .",
    "photon arrival times were converted to the solar system barycenter using the _ chandra _  derived source coordinates , @xmath29 ( j2000.0 ) , which we determined from the latest aspect analysis .",
    "figure  [ imageplot ] shows the exposure - corrected epic  mos image of  incorporating data from both _ xmm - newton _  observations , centered on .",
    "the new data closely matches the earlier _ chandra _  image presented in sun et al .",

    "this requires care in choosing the source and background regions . in the following analysis we choose a small source aperture @xmath30 in diameter centered on  to minimize background contamination from the snr",
    "this region encloses @xmath31 of the source flux .",
    "an annular background region would be contaminated by the increased snr emission to the northwest of the pulsar .",
    "this is particularly troublesome for the spectral analysis since the soft source spectrum overlaps that of the thermal emission from the snr . instead",
    ", background counts were accumulated from a relatively uniform , @xmath30 diameter region centered at coordinates @xmath32 ( j2000.0 ) , which is just to the southeast of the source .",
    "arrival times of photons in the energy range @xmath33  kev were extracted from the source region and searched for a pulsed signal using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .",
    "a highly significant signal is detected in the october  18 time series at @xmath34  ms using a @xmath35-bin transform .",
    "no higher harmonics were found .",
    "we constructed a periodogram centered on this signal using the @xmath36 ( rayleigh ) test @xcite and localized the pulsed emission to @xmath37  ms with a peak statistic of @xmath38 , after refining the energy range to an optimal @xmath39  kev energy band .",

    "the differences in @xmath36 and @xmath45 between the two observations are suggestive of a real change , but not large enough to be considered reliable at this stage . according to the prescription of @xcite , the two values of @xmath36 are inconsistent at approximately the @xmath46 level . if there is real variability of the pulse shape , it has important implications for the origin of the emission .",

    "we were not able to identify the correct period derivative unambiguously from the multiplicity of possible solutions .",
    "for an upper limit on the period derivative of @xmath0  s  s@xmath1 we can constrain the spin - down power of  to @xmath50  ergs  s@xmath1 , the inferred magnetic field to @xmath51  g , and the characteristic age to @xmath52  kyr , parameters that are typical of a rotation - powered pulsar with a normal magnetic field strength .",

    "pspc observation obtained on 1991 september 28 . given the background rates at the pulsar position , even if  were 100% pulsed , the effective pulsed fraction in the _ rosat _  observation would be no greater than @xmath59 .",
    "however , the data are not sensitive enough to reveal it .",
    "similarly , in two available _ asca _",
    "observations , one a dedicated 37  ks observation of , and the other a short ( 9  ks ) galactic ridge survey field observation , the expected pulsar signal is masked by snr emission because of the @xmath60 mirror resolution .",
    "source and background spectra from each data set were accumulated in apertures described in  2 . for each observation ,",
    "data from the two epic mos cameras ( mos1+mos2 ) were combined and analyzed as a single data set . after verifying that there were no",
    "emission - line features detectable , all spectra were grouped into bins containing a minimum of 40 counts ( including background ) .",
    "epic  pn and epic  mos spectra pairs from each observation were fitted simultaneously using the xspec package , with the normalization for each data free to vary independently .",
    "this allowed for differences in the overall flux calibration , apparent at the @xmath61 level .",
    "some instrumental variation is possibly due to the effects of the distinct pixel size and mirror point - spread function on measuring the diffuse snr emission over the source and background regions .",

    "its flux is found to be steady , but large variations of its period derivative may imply a wide binary system ( @xmath183  yr ) , frequent large glitches , or accretion from fall - back material @xcite . in any case , its wildly varying spin - down age is inconsistent with the remnant age of @xmath184  kyr .",
    "the x - ray spectrum shows broad absorption features at @xmath185 and @xmath186  kev @xcite and possibly at @xmath187 and @xmath188  kev when fitted with a thermal blackbody continuum model of @xmath189  kev and hard tail of @xmath190  kev @xcite .",

    "the inferred upper limit on its spin - down power is consistent with the absence of a bright pulsar wind nebula . from the age discrepancy between the pulsar and snr , it is possible that the initial spin - down power of  is sub - critical ( @xmath191 ) ; this may prove to be a defining property of the ccos .",
    "what is clearly distinctive about is its hot thermal emission and relatively high luminosity ( for its age and @xmath11 ) .",
    "these factors , along with the large pulse modulation , suggest a rotating hot spot , but the area and luminosity of this spot are greater by an order - of - magnitude than can be explained by existing theories of isolated neutron stars .",
    "accretion of fall - back material from a fossil disk in the propeller regime remains an option .",
    "an alternative interpretation is a low - luminosity axp , but the inferred magnetic field and rotation period are smaller than expected in this scenario .",
    "the x - rays from the pulsar are not easily produced in the context of the magnetar theory as the inferred @xmath192 field is insufficient to power the observed emission over the implied age of the ns .",
    "these unexplained x - ray properties of  may be symptomatic of the entire class of ccos , and may require intensive observational and theoretical efforts to understand .",
    "a radio detection would demonstrate cleanly that  is a rotation - powered pulsar , but the absence of radio pulsations would be inconclusive .",
    "frequent x - ray monitoring will test for evidence of accretion torques and/or glitches , and establish whether the x - ray flux and pulse profile are variable . by analogy with other isolated neutron stars that have broad x - ray absorption features ,",
