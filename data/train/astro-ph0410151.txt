    "star matter at supra ",
    "nuclear densities provide a firm upper limit on the mass for each eos .",
    "the stiffer the eos , the higher the mass limit . neutron stars with masses well above @xmath7 can not exist for so ",
    "called soft equations of state , in which matter at high densities is relatively compressible ( e.g. , due to meson condensation or a transition between the hadron and quark  gluon phases ; cf .",
    "therefore , measuring a high mass for even one neutron star would imply the firm rejection of many proposed soft eoss ( e.g.  see discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "neutron star masses of more than @xmath8 are excluded assuming ( among other things ) that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity and that the velocity of sound is less than the velocity of light ( @xcite ) . therefore , a lower limit on the mass of the compact object of 3 @xmath9 or more implies a black hole compact object .",
    "the most accurately measured neutron star masses we have are from precise radio timing measurements of double neutron",
    " star binaries .",
    "these empirical masses cluster around @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is close to the mass of 1.32 @xmath9 predicted from theoretical model calculations of type ib supernovae ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , these double neutron star binaries are formed in high  mass x  ray binaries and due to the short life of the massive companion only a limited amount of matter can be accreted .",
    "in contrast , in low  mass x",
    " ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , the rapid rotation and low magnetic field of the neutron stars are considered evidence for much larger amounts of accreted matter ( see @xcite for a review ) . indeed , from binary evolution models , lmxbs could accrete up to 0.7@xmath11 ( e.g.  ) .",
    "if so , the masses of their neutron stars could be @xmath12 .",
    "most of the constraints from timing observations of the successors of these lmxb primaries , the millisecond radio pulsars , are weak ( @xcite ) , as the almost purely circular orbits of these systems often prevents one from measuring most of the post  newtonian parameters that underlie the precise masses for the double  neutron star binaries . with masses of @xmath13 and 2.2@xmath14 ,",
    "the msec pulsars psr  b1855@xmath1509 and psr  j0751 + 1807 are exceptions to this ( @xcite ; @xcite ,  95%  conf . ) .    dynamical mass estimates or dynamically determined limits on the mass of the neutron star in lmxbs are available for the two transient sources cen  x4 and xte  j2123058 , the z  source cyg  x2 , and the pulsar 2s  1822371 ( cen  x4 ; @xmath160.6 @xmath11 @xcite ; xte  j2123058 ; @xmath170.31 @xmath11 @xcite ; cyg  x2 ; @xmath180.23 @xmath11 @xcite ; @xcite ; 2s  1822371 ; @xmath190.06 @xmath11 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is that many of the companion stars are small , late type stars which at a distance of more than a few kpc are too faint to observe , especially since the integration times are limited to typically 1/20th of the orbital period in order to avoid doppler smearing of the spectral lines due to the binary motion .",
    "furthermore , the binary inclination is often poorly constrained and effects of irradiation shift the centre - of - light with respect to the centre - of - mass",
    ".    some of the aforementioned problems will be less severe when observing long orbital period systems for which the inclination is well constrained from the fact that eclipses are observed : 2s  0921630/v395  car is such a high inclination lmxb with a long orbital period ( p@xmath20 days ; e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the inclination of 2s  0921630 is relatively well constrained and must be high since partial eclipses of the compact object and accretion disc have been observed in both x  rays and optical wave bands ( e.g.  @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "2s  0921630 is thought to be a halo object in orbit with a k01 iii companion star ; absorption lines of the companion have been detected ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "the corresponding radial velocity curve would provide a limit to the mass of the companion star .",
    "in this paper we report on spectroscopic observations of 2s  0921630/v395  car .",
    "we observed 2s  0921630/v395  car with the fors2 spectrograph mounted on the yepun very large telescope ( vlt ) . in the period dec 26 , 2003",
    " mar 13 , 2004 , 22 spectra using the 1200r+93 and 22 spectra using the 1028z+29 grating have been obtained in service mode .",
    "the exposure time was 1300  s for each observation and a slit ",
    "width of 0.4 `` was used on each occasion .",
    "the dispersion was 0.75   per pixel for the spectra obtained with the 1200r+93 grating and 0.86   per pixel for the spectra obtained with the 1028z+29 grating . with a slit ",
    "width of 0.4 '' the two  pixel resolution is approximately 65 km s@xmath1 at 6500  . after each observing night helium  neon  argon lamp wavelength calibration spectra were obtained .",
    "the seeing varied between 0.5  and 1.4  and the spectra were obtained when the source had an airmass of @xmath21 , except on one occasion on jan 20 , 2004 when the airmass was nearly 2 .",
    "the spectra were bias subtracted , flatfield corrected , optimally extracted and wavelength calibrated using the iraf reduction package .",
    "the rms scatter in the wavelength calibration was @xmath220.03 .",
    "we further applied a small correction to the wavelength solution by aligning sky lines observed in each of the spectra . due to variations in seeing , resulting in variable slit losses , the signal  to  noise ratio varied between the spectra from @xmath2280240 over the wavelength range 59206520  .",
    "next , we exported the extracted spectra to the data analysis package molly .    in molly the observation times",
    "were first corrected to the heliocentric julian date time frame ( using utc times ) .",
    "next , we normalised and rebinned the spectra to a uniform velocity scale removing the earth s velocity .",
    "below , we first discuss results obtained using the 1200r+93 grating spectra .",
    "we cross  correlated the 1200r+93 grating spectra with spectra of template stars rebinned to the same velocity scale .",
    "nine template star spectra with spectral types ranging from g5k7 had been obtained with the keck telescope at similar resolution .",
    "we fitted a sinusoid to the measured velocities as a function of time .",
    "the fit - parameters are : the phase , the semi  amplitude , and the period of the sinusoid and the systemic velocity . however , since the errors on the velocity represent the statistical error bars only , they do not include the systematic effects which we found to be important ( we will come back to this in the discussion ) .",
    "therefore , the reduced @xmath23 of the fit was much larger than 1 . in order to estimate realistic errors on the fit parameters , we increased the size of the error bars such that the reduced @xmath23 was close to 1 .",
    "we found a best  fit period of 9.006@xmath24 days , consistent with the orbital period of @xmath229 days found before ( here and below we give 1 @xmath3 error bars ) . from this",
    "we derive an orbital ephemeris of hjd = 2453000.49(8 ) + n@xmath25 ( utc ) where phase zero is defined as superior conjunction of the neutron star and the number in between brackets denotes the uncertainty in the last digit .",
    "the derived ephemeris does not significantly depend on the spectral type of the used template star and is consistent within the errors with the ephemeris given by @xcite .",
    "we determined a radial velocity semi ",
    "amplitude of 99.1@xmath03.1 km s@xmath1 using the k1v template star hd  124106 ( see figure  [ radvel ] ) . the radial velocity semi - amplitude does not significantly depend on the spectral type of the template star . i.e.  the amplitudes we found varied by 2 km s@xmath1 between the minimum and maximum amplitude for template spectral types in the range of g5k7 .",
    "we found a systemic velocity of 44.4@xmath02.4 km s@xmath1 .        after correcting each individual spectrum for the observed sinusoidal velocity shift appropriate for the orbital phase we created an average spectrum in the frame of the donor star for the data of 2s  0921630 .",
    "one can in principle derive the rotational broadening from an optimal subtraction ( see for the description of this technique @xcite ) .",
    "however , our data is not well suited for this since the dispersion at which both the template star and the source were observed is relatively low ( @xmath26 km s@xmath1 per pixel in the 59206520   spectral range for the template star , this spectrum was resampled to the dispersion of @xmath27 km s@xmath1 per pixel in the 59206520   spectral range at which the source was observed ) . since the template stars were not obtained with the same telescope and instrumental set  up , the instrumental profile will be different from that of the object spectra ; together with the low resolution this means that it is not possible to reliably measure the rotational broadening when it is of the order of the spectral resolution .",
    "earlier results on the rotational broadening of 64@xmath09 km s@xmath1 measured by showed that this is likely the case . found a best  fit spectral type of k0 for the companion star ; we found that the residuals were smallest when we used the k1 template star hd  124106 ( irrespective of broadening ) .",
    "we further found that on average 20 per cent of the light comes from the companion star in the 59206520   range . in figure  [ optsub ]",
    "( _ left panel _ )",
    "we plot the average spectrum in this range , the broadened template star veiled by a source of constant light contributing 80 per cent of the light , and the residuals after subtraction the veiled template star spectrum .",
    "we used the spectral range from 59206520   for the optimal subtraction , however , the range in wavelengths between 62506350   was masked since it contains a strong interstellar absorption feature .",
    "we further examined whether the contribution of the k1 companion star to the total amount of light in the 59206520   range varies as a function of the binary orbital phase .",
    "we averaged spectra obtained at the same phase using phase bins of width 0.1 .",
    "we optimally subtracted the template spectrum of the k1 star from the average spectra in each phase bin .",
    "the measured fractional contribution of the companion star to the total amount of light in the 59206520   range is plotted in figure  [ compfrac ] . the large difference in fractional contribution from the k ",
    "star between phase 0 and phase 0.1 is difficult to explain .        besides the stellar absorption lines apparent in the wavelength range 59206520   shown in the top spectrum of the _ bottom left panel _ in figure  [ optsub ] , additional stellar absorption lines were present in the range 65206800 (see the _ top left panel _ in figure  [ optsub ] ) .",
    "furthermore , several emission lines are present in the spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , our observations lack the resolution to resolve these accretion disc lines and hence only one broad emission peak was observed whereas e.g.   observed that the h@xmath28 and he  i emission lines at 6562.76   and 6678.15  , respectively have the double peaked profile typically observed in accretion disc spectra .",
    "we detected a broad emission peak at @xmath226820   which we could not positively identify .",
    "we checked whether ccd defects were present at the position relevant for this wavelength in the flatfield images or in the individual images but none were found .",
    "so far , we have only discussed spectra obtained with the 1200r+93 grating . in figure  [ optsub ] ( _ bottom right panel _ ) we show the phase folded average spectra of the 1028z+29 grating in the range between 83008900  .",
    "clear donor star features such as the ca  ii triplet at 8498  , 8542  , and 8662  , and the mg  i line at 8806.75   can be seen at orbital phases where the back , non  irradiated side , of the companion star is observed .",
    "furthermore , superimposed on the paschen disc emission lines , paschen absorption lines can be seen .",
    "unfortunately , the combined effect of two unresolved broad accretion disc emission lines , a paschen absorption line and , at some wavelengths , and at certain orbital phases , a ca  ii absorption line is too difficult to disentangle with the limited resolution data in hand .",
    "therefore , we did not use these spectra for our radial velocity study .",
    "besides the features visible in the _ bottom right panel _ of figure  [ optsub ] we identified two other lines in the 1028z+29 grating spectra ; a weak fe  i absorption line complex near 7750   and a paschen emission line at 9229  (see the _ top right panel _ in figure  [ optsub ] ) .",
    "we determined the radial velocity curve of the companion star in 2s  0921630/v395  car using vlt / fors2 spectroscopic observations .",
    "a sinusoidal fit to the radial velocity measurements with a semi  amplitude , k@xmath29 , of 99.1@xmath03.1 km s@xmath1 and with a systemic velocity , @xmath3044.4@xmath02.4 km s@xmath1 represents the data well . in these error estimates",
    "we artificially increased the error bars on the individual velocity measurements by a factor 4 in order to obtain a reduced @xmath23 of the fit close to 1 . before we discuss the implications of the k  velocity , we investigate possible reasons for the large reduced @xmath23 obtained when using the formal statistical errors only .    near quadrature at phase 0.25",
    "the velocity measurements obtained on different nights differ well beyond the statistical errors . from figure  [ compfrac ]",
    "we can see that the companion star contribution to the total amount of light in the 59206520   range varies as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the phasing of this variation suggests that the centre of light emitted by the k ",
    "star is likely to be shifted with respect to its centre of mass .",
    "an explanation is that the inner side of the companion star is heated by the ( x  ray ) irradiation coming from ( near ) the compact object , reducing the equivalent width of the k ",
    "star stellar lines in the range 59206520   ( see also e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this manifests itself in several ways : a lower fractional contribution to the total amount of light from the k star at e.g.  phase 0.5 when using the optimal subtraction technique ( e.g.  figure  [ compfrac ] ) an increase in velocity ( especially near quadrature ) with respect to the velocity associated with the centre of mass of the companion star , since the line profiles will , as a result of the stellar rotation , be preferentially shifted to either a larger red- ( phase 0.25 ) or blue - shift ( phase 0.75 ) .",
    "hence , variations in the amount of ( x  ray ) irradiation between the observations could explain the variations in velocities near quadrature as observed in figure  [ radvel ] .",
    "since the observations were obtained with at least one day in between , with a baseline of several months , it seems likely that the irradiation changed between the observations .",
    "furthermore , the velocity measurements around phase 0.5 do not fall on the best ",
    "fit sinusoid .",
    "those at phases 0.40.5 lay above the best ",
    "fit sinusoid , whereas those at phases 0.50.6 fall below the curve .",
    "this could well be explained by the rossiter effect ( cf .",
    "such deviations occur if the companion star is partially eclipsed by the accretion disc .",
    "such a partial eclipse of the companion star can also help explain the low fraction of light coming from the companion star at phase 0.5 ( see figure  [ compfrac ] ) .",
    "the radial velocity measurements at phases just prior to phase 0.5 , the partial eclipse of the companion star , are biased to higher , red shifted velocities since the part of the companion star that is eclipsed at those phases is mainly rotating towards the observer .",
    "hence , the rotational broadening of the line will be biased towards the red .",
    "the reverse holds for phases just after the partial eclipse .    for the rotational",
    "broadening of the stellar lines we take @xmath31 km s@xmath1 as found by . for a roche lobe filling companion star",
    "the following relation holds : @xmath32^\\frac{1}{3}$ ] ( e.g.  @xcite ; q is defined here as m@xmath29 divided by the mass of the compact object , m@xmath33 ) .",
    "before we can determine q , and hence with k@xmath29 the mass of the compact object , we have to take effects of the non  uniform absorption distribution on the stellar surface caused by irradiation into account . to this end",
    ", @xcite developed a so  called k  correction .",
    "following the procedure laid out in @xcite , @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the corrected observed ( @xmath36 ) radial velocity semi  amplitude and @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the distance between the centre - of - mass of the binary and the centre - of - mass of the companion star and @xmath39 is a geometrical correction factor less than 1 . in the extreme case that the hemisphere facing the compact object does not contribute to the observed stellar absorption lines at all and the other hemisphere has a uniform absorption line strength , @xmath40 ( @xcite ) . since we still have a contribution of the k1 star of around 7 per cent at phase 0.5 we know that this is an overestimation of the k  correction in the case of 2s  0921630 .",
    "hence , applying this upper limit on the k ",
    "correction , @xmath41 km s@xmath1 , we get a firm lower limit of k@xmath42 km s@xmath1 . plugging  in the numbers given above yields q@xmath431.32@xmath44",
    "; note that in deriving this we used the equation for @xmath45 of @xcite which is valid for @xmath46 .",
    "however , the difference with the equation of @xcite is small for q@xmath471.7 and does not change the result significantly given the large uncertainty in @xmath48 .",
    "the uncertainty in q is dominated by the large error on the rotational velocity .",
    "thus , we find for the minimum mass of the compact object , @xmath49 . as mentioned in the introduction , the inclination of 2s  0921630 must be high .",
    "furthermore , we have presented evidence for a partial eclipse of the companion star . for inclinations ,",
    "@xmath50 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) the mass of the compact object is @xmath51 .",
    "using @xmath52 , we get for the radius of the companion star , @xmath53 , @xmath54 . under the assumption that the companion star fills its roche lobe",
    ", the mass of the donor star , @xmath55 , depends only on its radius and the orbital period ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which gives @xmath56 ( here the orbital period is measured in hours , and the mass and radius of the companion star are in solar units ) .",
    "this gives @xmath57 .",
    "this m@xmath29 suggests an interesting evolutionary stage of the binary .",
    "m@xmath29 is more massive than standard donor stars in lmxbs .",
    "recently , there have been a number of evolutionary calculations ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) showing that systems with donor masses as high as @xmath585 m@xmath59  can enter a relatively long phase of mass transfer to a neutron star after the donor has lost most of its mass .",
    "2s  0921630 would nicely fit in this scenario , evolving along the track of an initial 34 m@xmath59  donor .",
    "however , in this evolutionary scenario the current time - averaged mass - transfer rate is expected to be high , certainly super - eddington .",
    "this is at odds with the finding from studying x - ray lines as measured with _",
    "chandra _ and xmm_newton _ that the observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath60 erg s@xmath1 ( for a distance of @xmath587 kpc ) is likely close to the intrinsic source luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the current mass - transfer rate is much lower than the time - averaged transfer rate , or the donor mass and/or the mass - ratio are overestimated .",
    "above , we assumed that the companion star is in co  rotation with the binary orbit .",
    "synchronization of the rotational period and the binary period occurs on timescales shorter than the circularization timescale ( e.g.  @xcite ) and no signs for orbital eccentricity have been found ( see figure  [ radvel ] ) .",
    "furthermore , using the companion star parameters derived above and equation 7 of @xcite we find that the synchronization timescale is @xmath61100 yr for 2s  0921630 , justifying this assumption .",
    "we conclude that the compact object in 2s  0921630 is likely to be a massive neutron star or a low - mass black hole . if indeed the compact object in 2s  0921630 is a massive neutron star the mass measurement would rule out soft equations of state .",
    "future high resolution optical observations should provide a much more accurate handle on the rotational velocity of the companion star , yielding a more accurate constraint on the mass of the compact object .",
