    "there have been many models for the evolution of the bias @xmath0 derived from empirical knowledge @xcite , theory @xcite , simulations and from observations which account for the growth and merging of collapsed structure @xcite .",
    "however , all of these bias fitting forms include the unknown free parameters which need to be fitted with the set of galaxy bias data and simulation .",
    "it is shown that an incorrect bias model causes a shift in measured values of cosmological parameters @xcite . thus , the accurate modeling to @xmath0 is prerequisite for the precision cosmology .",
    "we obtain the exact linear bias obtained from its definition and show its dependence both on cosmology and on gravity theory .",
    "we provide @xmath0 which can be obtained from both theory and observation .",
    "this analytic solution for the bias allows one to use it as a cosmological parameter instead of a nuisance one .",
    "the observed linear galaxy power spectrum using a fiducial model including the effects of bias and the redshift space distortions is given by @xcite p_gal^(k,z ) = b^2 p_m(k , z_0 ) ( 1 + ^2)^2 ( ) ^2 [ pgal ] , where @xmath2 ( ratio of the hubble parameter of the adopted fiducial model , @xmath3 to that of the true model , @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 ( ratio of the angular diameter distance of the true model , @xmath6 to that of the adopted fiducial model , @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 defining the linear bias factor , @xmath9 means the present matter power spectrum , the redshift space distortions ( rsd ) parameter , @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the linear growth factor of the matter fluctuation , @xmath13 with @xmath14 meaning @xmath15 .",

    "the different gravity theories provide the different bias .",

    "this solution can be generalized to many models including the modified gravity theories and the massive neutrino dark matter model by replacing the approximate solution used in this _",

    "this theoretical form of bias can be measured from measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath29 from galaxy surveys if we achieve enough binned data .",
    "also a known degeneracy between the equation of state @xmath38 and the growth index parameter @xmath54 due to the evolution of @xmath39 can be broken due to this exact form of bias and can be used to distinguish the dark energy from the modified gravity .",
