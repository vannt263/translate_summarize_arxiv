    "the new spectropolatimeters make it possible to detect the low polarimetric signals characteristic of the in fields .",
    "sophisticated diagnostic techniques are needed to interpret those signals , which depend in a non - trivial way on the ( a priori unknown ) physical properties of the magnetized plasma .",
    "for example , opposite polarities often coexist in the resolution elements giving rise to very asymmetric line profiles requiring special methods of diagnostic ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the numerical simulations provide guidance for the magnetic field topology to be expected , a knowledge critical for a proper interpretation of the observables .",
    "the magnetic field strength is one of the key parameters to characterize the magnetism of the quiet sun .",
    "its study has a rather long tradition , with a period of unsuccessful attempts @xcite , followed by the first estimates by @xcite and @xcite based on hanle depolarization measurements .",
    "the observed hanle signals agree with a volume - filling mixed - polarity magnetic field of constant field strength @xcite .",
    "the value of the estimated mean field strength has increased upon refinement of the diagnostic techniques .",
    "the most recent estimate by @xcite and @xcite are consistent with a constant field of 60  g ( or a mean field of 130  g assuming an exponential distribution of magnetic field strengths ) .",
    "most measurements of the quiet sun magnetic fields are based on interpreting line polarization signals caused by the more familiar zeeman effect .",
    "they show a rather different magnetism , with structures occupying a small fraction of the solar surface and having intense fields in the range of the hectogauss ( hg ) and the kilogauss ( kg ) .",
    "actually , the field strength depends in a systematic way on the zeeman splitting of the spectral line employed to measure .",
    "the works using visible lines deduce the presence of kg magnetic fields @xcite , while measurements based on infrared ( ir ) lines infer sub - kg field strengths @xcite .",
    "this apparent inconsistency among the various measurements of field strength , plus the guidance of numerical simulations of magneto - convection , suggest that the quiet sun has a continuous distribution of field strengths going all the way from 0  g to 2  kg @xcite .",
    "therefore , each one of the individual measurements mentioned above is biased , providing only a partial view of the magnetic fields existing in the quiet sun .",
    "we think that this biased information can be cleaned up and assembled to provide a reasonable estimate of the intrinsic magnetic field strength distribution . this work describes a method to recover such information .    due to the variety of field strengths",
    ", they are best characterized by a probability density function pdf .",
    "the magnetic field strength pdf , @xmath0 , is defined as the probability that a point of the atmosphere chosen at random has a magnetic field strength @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , it describes the fraction of quiet sun occupied by fields with a strength @xmath1 .",
    "the pdf approach to characterizing the quiet sun field strength is both convenient and powerful .",
    "first , one can directly compare observations with numerical simulations , which predict @xmath0 .",
    "second , it concentrates basic information on the quiet sun magnetism , e.g. , the first moment @xmath3 is connected with the unsigned magnetic flux density , which is the average of the magnetic field vector modulus .",
    "there is no possible misunderstanding , though .",
    "the term is employed consistently throughout the text , and the actual unsigned flux is never mentioned except in this footnote . ] , whereas the second moment provides the magnetic energy density @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath6 there are several observational magnetic field strengths pdfs in the literature ( see the references cited in the previous paragraph ) . as we pointed out above ,",
    "all of them are known to be severely biased . on the one hand ,",
    "those based on hanle signals miss the strong fields , since the hanle depolarization does not vary for field strengths above a threshold that is typically smaller than a few hundred  g ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the zeeman measurements show only a small fraction of the existing magnetic structures ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the zeeman signals tend to cancel when opposite polarities coexist in the resolution elements .",
    "we detect only the residuals left when the cancellation is not perfect ( e.g. , when the two polarities do not have exactly the same magnetic flux , when strong doppler shifts separate the absorption produced by the two polarities , when the temperature imbalance between polarities creates net signals , and so on ) . here",
    "we try to get rid of all these observational biases to produce an empirical @xmath0 .",
    "we approach the problem by assuming a flexible yet reasonable shape for the expected pdf .",
    "this guess is based on recent numerical simulations of magneto - convection , as well as on the latest hanle and zeeman observations .",
    "the actual @xmath0 is set by forcing the pdf to meet several observational and theoretical constraints .",
    "so far as we are aware of , this is the first quiet sun pdf satisfying magnetic field strength observations going all the way from 0  g to 2  kg .",
    "( the premises were already put forward by @xcite , though . )",
    "the success of the trial is only partial since rather than a single pdf we derive a family compatible with the present observations .",
    "however , the approach is shown to be viable , so that future more precise observations will allow us to narrow down the range of possibilities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ;   [ synthesis ] describes how to piece together all the ingredients needed to estimate an unbiased pdf .",
    "some of the more tedious details are completed in appendix  [ ap1 ] .",
    "the properties of the pdfs satisfying the observational constraints are extracted and analyzed in   [ results ] . in particular , we compare the semi - empirical pdfs with theoretical pdfs coming from numerical simulations of magneto - convection .",
    "finally ,   [ conclusions ] summarizes the main conclusions , discusses their consequences , and points out the natural way to proceed .",
    "in order to facilitate the reading of this detailed section , we start off by listing the thread of the argument .    1 .   the _ unbiased _ quiet sun pdf can be approximated by a linear combination of the _ biased _ pdfs inferred from zeeman signals and from hanle signals (   [ shape ] ) .",
    "the shape of the zeeman pdf is obtained from observations .",
    "the shape of the hanle pdf is not constrained by observations , and so we take it from numerical simulations of magneto - convection (   [ shape ] ) .",
    "the hanle and zeeman signals come from different photospheric heights .",
    "one needs a transformation to express them in a common height , in other words , a recipe for the variation with height in the atmosphere of the pdfs (   [ strat ] ) .",
    "4 .   piecing together this information , we work out a semi - analytical pdf depending on three free parameters .",
    "one needs only three independent observables to set it (   [ constraints ] ) .",
    "the zeeman induced polarization changes the sign depending on the orientation of the vector magnetic field with respect to the observer .",
    "when magnetic fields with varied directions coexist in the resolution elements , the net polarization tends to cancel .",
    "the lack of polarization is interpreted as absence of magnetic fields , so that the zeeman measurements underestimate the volume occupied by magnetic fields .",
    "this bias increases with decreasing field strength , since the zeeman signals scale with the field strength .",
    "the hanle induced depolarization does not suffer the cancellation of the zeeman signals .",
    "however , the hanle induced depolarization is insensitive to magnetic field strengths larger than a few hundred  g .",
    "thus the biases of the hanle and zeeman measurements turn out to be complementary . keeping in mind this complementarity",
    ", one can approximate the true unbiased pdf , @xmath0 , as a linear combination of the biased pdf inferred from zeeman signals , @xmath7 , plus the biased pdf that fits the hanle signals , @xmath8 , @xmath9 with @xmath8 and @xmath7 normalized to unity , and the weight @xmath10 .",
    "a full derivation of this equation is given in appendix  [ ap1 ] .",
    "regarding @xmath7 , we take the shape of the biased pdf measured by @xcite .",
    "it is based on a realistic semi - empirical modeling of 2280 stokes profiles of fe  i  @xmath116301.5   , fe  i  @xmath116302.5   , fe  i  @xmath1115648   , and fe  i  @xmath1115652  observed simultaneously in a quiet sun region .",
    "these four spectral lines are complementary since those in the visible spectral range sense preferentially the kg fields whereas the ir lines tend to detect hg field strengths @xcite .",
    "the empirical zeeman pdf shape adopted here is not very different from the one derived by means of milne - eddington fits to the same stokes profiles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two pdfs are shown in figure  [ pdfz ] .",
    "both are rather broad with a local maximum at kg fields .",
    "the differences are unimportant for the present work , and they are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the hanle effect modifies the polarization produced in scattering processes , and so it only affects lines formed in nlte ( non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ) .",
    "hanle based studies are therefore restricted to lines formed high in the atmosphere , where the collisions are low enough for the scattering events to be frequent .",
    "however , we need hanle signals formed as low as possible , so that they can be compared with zeeman signals produced in the low - mid photosphere",
    ". the hanle signals of sr  i  @xmath114607    are formed particularly low ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , this line allows a simple treatment of the usually very complex synthesis of the hanle signals ( see , * ? ? ? * and also the discussion in   [ constraints ] ) .",
    "sr  i  @xmath114607    is chosen to constrain the pdf for these two unusual properties . as it is argued in",
    ", e.g. , @xcite , the hanle signals of sr  i  @xmath114607    do not constrain the shape of the pdf .",
    "this limitation is overcome here by parameterizing the shape of @xmath8 using an analytic function .",
    "the hanle signals have been interpreted with approximations using dirac @xmath12-functions , exponential functions , and maxwellian distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these shapes do not fit in our needs .",
    "first , we expect a continuous distribution of field strengths , which discards dirac @xmath12-functions .",
    "second , the exponential fall off with field strength , @xmath13 is too pronounced according to the pdfs resulting from numerical simulations of magneto - convection ( see , e.g. , the dotted line in figure  [ pdf1]a ) . the maxwellian distribution can be discarded with the same argument , since the fall off is even more pronounced than the exponential one .",
    "inspired by the numerical simulations of magneto - convection developed with the muram code @xcite , we choose a log - normal distribution @xmath8 , @xmath14 , \\label{logn}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 and @xmath16 two parameters related to the two first moments of the distribution , @xmath17 and @xmath18    figure  [ pdf1 ] compares numerical pdfs from @xcite with fits using log - normal functions and exponential functions .",
    "( all the fits were performed for @xmath19 500  g. ) the two plots correspond to an initial vertical field of 10  g ( figure  [ pdf1]a ) and 50  g ( figure  [ pdf1]b ) , and the parameters of the log - normal pdfs are @xmath20 g , and @xmath21 g , respectively .",
    "the log - normal fits are much better than the exponentials , and we choose them to represent @xmath8 .",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "the log - normals tend to zero when @xmath220  g. actually , they reach a maximum at @xmath23 with , @xmath24 counterintuitive as it sounds , the property of having a maximum is to be expected for the true quiet sun pdf . when the field strength is small enough , the magnetic fields are easily modified and randomized by the convective motions .",
    "those weak fields are expected to have an isotropic distribution of field directions , with the three components of the magnetic field being independent .",
    "suppose that the magnetic field strength of these weak fields has a typical value @xmath25 different from zero but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "for a point of the atmosphere to have @xmath26 the three components of the magnetic field vector must be zero simultaneously .",
    "this event is highly improbable since the three components are independent .",
    "consequently , it is to be expected that @xmath270 when @xmath28 .",
    "the drop at small fields is also clearly seen in some numerical simulations of magneto - convection ( e.g. , figure  [ pdf1]b ; figure  3 in @xcite ; figure  5.25 in @xcite ) .",
    "the photosphere is strongly stratified , with the gas pressure decreasing exponentially with the height in the atmosphere .",
    "part of the pressure that maintains the mechanical balance of a magnetic structure is provided by the magnetic pressure , which has to decrease to keep up with the pressure drop .",
    "since the magnetic flux is conserved , the decrease of field strength comes together with an expansion of the field lines and an increase of the volume occupied by the magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these two effects modify the pdf .",
    "as we pointed out above , the hanle signals are formed high in the photosphere . in order to use them to constrain a pdf at the base of the photosphere , one needs to know how the pdf varies with height . working out such variation",

    "in this approximation , the magnetic field strength of an isolated static structure surrounded by field free plasma drops with the height in the atmosphere as the square root of the field free gas pressure . in our case , @xmath35 with magnetic field strength scale height @xmath36 twice the gas pressure scale height , and so , independent of the field strength .",
    "the cross - section of one of these thin fluxtubes @xmath37 increases with height as the field strength decreases .",
    "the need to conserve the magnetic flux imposes , @xmath38 so that the product @xmath39 does not depend on @xmath29 .",
    "the expansion is made at the expense of the field free plasma surrounding the magnetic concentration . in our case",
    "there is no such field free plasma , so that an increase of the volume occupied by one magnetic structure requires shrinking the volume occupied by others ( see the two magnetic concentrations in figure  [ height_var]a ) .    which physical parameter determines why some concentrations expand whereas others shrink ?",
    "the magnetic forces responsible for the expansion or contraction scale with the square of the magnetic field strength .",

    "the very strong fields are expected to be bright in unpolarized images .",
    "part of the pressure required to maintain the plasma in mechanical balance is provided by the magnetic pressure .",
    "when the magnetic pressure of a particular structure is comparable to the mean gas pressure of the atmosphere , the structure must have low mass density and so it becomes transparent .",
    "we see deeper through the magnetized structure , and deeper often means hotter and brighter .",
    "the mean pressure at @xmath45 is equivalent to a magnetic pressure provided by a field strength of some 1800  g. in order to estimate which fraction of the quiet sun magnetic fields could be bright , we consider the strongest magnetic fields in the pdfs , say , those larger than two - thirds of the maximum value , or larger than 1200  g. figure  [ pdfb1]a shows @xmath110 versus @xmath111 for three representative pdfs fulfilling the hanle constraint .",

    "the main effect is decreasing the value of @xmath15 needed to reproduce the observations , and so , decreasing the magnetic field where @xmath0 is maximum ( @xmath85 , see equation  [ [ maxposition ] ] ) .",
    "this shift of @xmath85 can be achieved without a large variation of the unsigned magnetic flux and magnetic energy .",
    "this is due to the fact that the tail of hg and kg field strengths is the mayor contributor to the flux and energy , and this tail is not very sensitive to @xmath15 , and so , to @xmath85 .",
    "for instance , the reference pdf ( @xmath94 , @xmath92 ) has @xmath114  g , @xmath11570  g , and @xmath116 when @xmath113 , whereas @xmath117  g , @xmath115150  g , and @xmath118 when @xmath119 .",

    "second , all zeeman signals tend to cancel , but the cancellation of opposite polarity low field strength signals is more effective . typically , there are many more weak magnetic field features per resolution element than strong magnetic field features .",
