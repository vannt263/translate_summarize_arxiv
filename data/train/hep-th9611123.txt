    "over the last two years considerable progress in the understanding of the strong coupling regime in @xmath0 yang - mills theory has been made , pioneered by the work of seiberg and witten @xcite where a self - consistent non - perturbative superfield effective lagrangian was found for an @xmath2 gauge group .",
    "this has later been extended to higher groups @xcite .",
    "the crucial properties which make the @xmath3-theory accessible for an exact treatment are the holomorphic properties of the effective lagrangian and the @xmath4-loop exactness of the perturbative @xmath5-function .",
    "the idea is then to extrapolate the perturbative ( weak coupling ) @xmath5-function to the full range of couplings . making the assumption that the strong coupling behaviour is related in a definite way ( ie . by @xmath6-duality ) to the weak coupling regime lead to an elegant , self - consistent solution for the low energy effective lagrangian in @xcite .",
    "furthermore the duality is closely related to the electric - magnetic duality conjectured earlier by olive and montonen @xcite to be a non - perturbative property of some quantum field theories .",
    "the authors of @xcite motivate the duality assumption with several convincing arguments based on physical intuition .",
    "furthermore recent explicit @xmath4-and @xmath7-instanton computations @xcite confirm the first two coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the exact solution proposed in @xcite . on the other hand",
    "strongly coupled systems have surprised us on several occasions with counter - intuitive results . also , recent instanton calculations indicate that the extension of @xcite for models including matter multiplets given in @xcite is ambiguous @xcite .",
    "therefore the question whether the assumptions made in @xcite are necessary or whether the exact effective lagrangian can be obtained from weaker assumptions is of much interest .",
    "it is that question we address here .",
    "indeed we prove that , provided supersymmetry is unbroken , the uniqueness of sw solution follows assuming only that the number of strong - coupling singularities on the moduli space is finite .",
    "our strategy is as follows : we first construct the general effective lagrangian , compatible with perturbation theory , analyticity and the @xmath8-vacuum .",
    "note that the first two conditions are consequences of supersymmetry alone .",
    "it turns out that the existence of the @xmath8-parameter restricts the set of admissible solutions considerably .",
    "indeed the existence of the @xmath8-parameter already contains the seeds of duality , in the sense that either the theory has complete @xmath9-symmetry , or the moduli space contains a point which is conjugate to the weak coupling regime .",
    "even so , the solution is not unique at that level .",
    "we then make use of the fact that for an asymptotically free theory , the scale of the low energy coupling is set by the mass of the lightest charged field .",
    "we therefore impose the further constraint that the mass of the lightest charged field be finite except in the asymptotically free regime .",
    "the set of solutions then collapses to a single member , which is precisely the seiberg - witten solution .",
    "the same result is achieved by demanding that the expectation value @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the scalar component of the @xmath0-multiplet , is finite except in the asymptotically free regime .",
    "this property is very much expected for an asymptotically free theory .",
    "we also obtain the dependence of this observable on the point in the moduli space on general grounds .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section @xmath7 we review the peculiar properties of @xmath3 yang - mills theory which we will take as the only inputs for the later sections . in section",
    "@xmath12 we construct the general solution for the effective lagrangian compatible with these requirements . in section",
    "@xmath13 we then include the finite mass constraint in our analysis and show that it reduces the above set of solutions to the sw one .",
    "the role of the expectation value @xmath10 is explained in section @xmath14 .",
    "some of the mathematical constructions needed for the main text and the argument relating the @xmath8-vacuum to duality are given in two appendices .",
    "a crucial property of @xmath3-yang - mills theory is the presence of flat directions in the potential for the scalar component @xmath11 of the @xmath3-multiplet , @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath16 is the coupling constant .",
    "the potential vanishes for constant @xmath11 taking its value in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group .",
    "furthermore , for unbroken supersymmetry , this degeneracy can not be removed by quantum corrections @xcite . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the higgs mechanism breaks the gauge symmetry spontaneously down to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the rank of the cartan subalgebra . in what follows we concentrate on @xmath2 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , it can be deduced from @xmath0 supersymmetry that , when expressed in terms of the cartan algebra - valued @xmath3-superfield @xmath20 , the most general local @xmath21 supersymmetric low energy effective lagrangian must be of the form    where the prepotential @xmath22 , to be determined , is the result of integrating out the massive ( ie . charged , root - valued ) fields . in @xmath23 notation ( [ eff1 ] ) becomes @xcite    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the chiral- and vector @xmath23 superfields respectively .",
    "furthermore    since @xmath26 is the coefficient of the kinetic term in ( [ action2 ] ) its imaginary part must be positive .",
    "on the other hand its real part plays the role of an effective @xmath8-angle : @xmath27 .",
    "thus a shift of @xmath8 by @xmath28 corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "therefore the group @xmath30 is a symmetry group of the theory .",
    "the invariance of the chiral part in ( [ action2 ] ) together with ( [ ada ] ) requires then that @xmath31 be represented linearly on @xmath32 by a subgroup of @xmath33 .",
    "a remarkable consequence of @xmath21 supersymmetry is that the mass of the charged particles must be proportional to the central charge @xmath34 of the susy - algebra .",
    "more precisely @xcite    here @xmath35 is the expectation value of the scalar component of the @xmath3 superfield and @xmath36 .",
    "the integers @xmath37 and @xmath38 label electric and magnetic charge respectively . the use of the dual variable @xmath39 exhibits the @xmath40 invariance of the mass formula ( [ z ] ) and of the first integral in ( [ action2 ] ) .    at the classical level @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore the @xmath42-invariance of the first integral in ( [ action2 ] ) reflects the @xmath43-symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "the theory is then parameterized by two real parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( the phase of @xmath46 is irrelevant because of @xmath43-symmetry).in the quantum theory the mass of the charged fields sets the scale for the low energy coupling . because of asymptotic freedom perturbation theory is then valid for large masses ( @xmath47 ) . at the semiclassical level",
    "we then have ( @xmath48 ) @xcite    where @xmath49 depends on the renormalization scheme adopted .",
    "the divergence of the @xmath43-current is in the same supermultiplet as the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and is therefore also anomalous at @xmath4-loop .",
    "consequently @xmath43-symmetry is broken to the discrete group @xmath50 .",
    "because of the @xmath3 supersymmetry higher loop perturbative corrections to the running coupling are absent @xcite .",
    "note that due to the quantum corrections the low energy theory is parameterized by either of the complex parameters @xmath46 with values in @xmath51 , or @xmath52 which takes any value in the upper half plane @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , the space of inequivalent vacua , or moduli space , @xmath54 is one ( complex ) dimensional .",
    "in addition to the perturbative corrections , reviewed in the last section , the low energy effective theory receives corrections due to topologically non - trivial configurations @xcite . in principle , of course , @xmath55 could be computed directly from the functional integral but in practice this is far too difficult .",
    "the problem is then to determine @xmath55 or equivalently @xmath56 from their properties established in the previous section : @xmath52 is an analytic function of @xmath46 with @xmath57 and satisfies the boundary condition ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "the analyticity of @xmath52 follows from the analyticity of the prepotential @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath40 structure mentioned above and the structure of the instanton contributions to ( [ tau ] ) found in @xcite suggest that , asymptotically at least , @xmath56 is an inverse modular function .",
    "seiberg and witten proposed that @xmath52 be an inverse modular function everywhere on @xmath54 , where @xmath54 is parameterized by some variable @xmath58 , with @xmath59 asymptotically . to go further they made the two following assumptions : 0.2truecm ( i )",
    "_ minimality _ : @xmath60 has just _ two _ singularities for finite @xmath61 , 0.2truecm ( ii ) _ duality _ : the monodromy matrix for @xmath60 at one of the singularities is the transpose of that for @xmath62 .",
    "0.3truecm they then showed that there is a unique function @xmath60 with these properties , which in turn can be lifted to a unique effective prepotential @xmath55 .",
    "later it was found @xcite that the first two coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the proposed @xmath55 agreed with direct instanton computations .",
    "the latter result is evidently a strong indication that the sw ansatz is correct .",
    "more recently it has been shown that @xmath55 can be obtained from somewhat weaker assumptions . however , a critical assumption that is made in @xcite is that @xmath63 parameterizes the moduli space @xmath64 . as we shall see this is equivalent to assuming that the wronskian of @xmath46 and @xmath39 with respect to the moduli parameter is constant .    below",
    "we show that these assumptions , although correct , are not necessary . specifically our inputs are : 0.2truecm ( a ) the effective coupling constant @xmath65 takes all values in the upper half plane @xmath53 . 0.2truecm",
    "( b ) the mass @xmath66 of the lightest charged field ( possibly composite ) is finite except in the asymptotically free region .",
    "0.2truecm ( c ) the mass @xmath67 is a single valued function on the moduli space , @xmath68 , @xmath69.0.2truecm ( d ) the set of singular points of @xmath64 is finite .      due to the @xmath4-loop corrections ( [ tau ] ) , @xmath34 , @xmath39 and @xmath52 are multiple - valued transcendental functions of @xmath46 , whereas @xmath34 , @xmath39 and @xmath46 are single - valued functions of the coupling @xmath70 .",
    "thus , @xmath52 is the obvious candidate for the uniformizing parameter . of course",
    ", distinct values of the effective coupling @xmath52 may correspond to equivalent vacua .",
    "for instance , we already know that @xmath52 and @xmath71 have to be identified .",
    "we therefore introduce the concept of a _ maximal equivalence group _ @xmath72 .",
    "this is defined as the group of all transformations @xmath16 of @xmath52 that leave @xmath73 invariant rather than @xmath52 ; however , this distinction only becomes important when matter hypermultiplets are included @xcite .",
    "] i.e.    the action of @xmath72 on @xmath52 then induces an action @xmath74 on @xmath75 .",
    "the invariance of the spectrum ( [ z ] ) together with the integer valuedness of the charges @xmath76 imply that @xmath74 acts linearly on @xmath77 and indeed is a subgroup of @xmath78 .",
    "the conditions @xmath79 and    then imply that @xmath72 is a subgroup of @xmath80 and acts on @xmath52 by modular transformations . as noted in the context of the sw solution in @xcite , the @xmath42 factor in @xmath74",
    "can not be ignored because the mass - spectrum is determined by @xmath81 and not @xmath34 . as we shall see in the next section , and",
    "was noted for the sw solution in @xcite , the @xmath42-factor corresponds to the fact that @xmath77 is a section of a non - trivial @xmath82 bundle .",
    "we conclude that the set of inequivalent couplings @xmath52 is a fundamental domain @xmath83 of the maximal equivalence group @xmath72 .",
    "the domain @xmath84 is then in @xmath85 correspondence with the moduli space @xmath86 . because @xmath87 , @xmath84 is a polygon bounded by arcs @xcite .",
    "it is at this point that we make use of the assumption that the number of strong coupling singularities be finite .",
    "the corners of the fundamental domain @xmath84 correspond to singularities in the moduli space .",
    "finite number of singularities then requires that the polygon @xmath84 has a finite number of corners .",
    "if this condition was not fulfilled then the set of corners of @xmath84 and therefore the set of singularities in @xmath86 would necessarily have an accumulation point .      in this section",
    "we show that for any group @xmath72 for which the fundamental domain has a finite number of corners , we can construct functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 such that @xmath79 ,    [ [ general - form - of - tau ] ] general form of @xmath52 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the polygon @xmath84 is bounded by arcs and has a finite number of corners .",
    "one of them corresponds to the weak - coupling singularity @xmath90 .",
    "we now make use of the fact that @xmath84 can be parameterized by means of a fuchsian mapping @xcite @xmath91 .",
    "the schwarzian of @xmath52    has the simple form    where @xmath92 is the number of edges of @xmath84 , the @xmath93 s are the points on the real axis into which the corners of the polygon @xmath84 are mapped .",
    "furthermore the @xmath94 are the interior angles of the polygon . in ( [ fuc1 ] )",
    "we have chosen to map the weak - coupling singularity @xmath95 to infinity in the @xmath96-plane .",
    "since the corresponding angle is zero we have @xcite    this condition puts two constraints on the @xmath5 s .",
    "thus there are @xmath97 parameters for each set of polygons with @xmath98 corners .",
    "actually only @xmath99 of these are independent because the origin and the scale of @xmath96 on the real axis are still free parameters .",
    "if we furthermore identify segments on the real line in the @xmath96-plane , that are mapped into edges of the polygon @xmath84 which are equivalent with respect to @xmath72 , then the equivalence group @xmath72 of @xmath52 is just its monodromy group with respect to @xmath96 .",
    "this makes it natural to parameterize the moduli space by @xmath100 .",
    "the useful property of fuchsian functions is that @xmath101 can be written as @xcite    where @xmath102 is solution of the second order differential equation ( @xmath103 )    since the wronskian @xmath104 of @xmath105 and @xmath106 is constant @xmath72 acts linearly on @xmath107 with a trivial @xmath42 .",
    "[ [ lifting ] ] lifting : + + + + + + + +    we now show that the previous second order differential equation for @xmath107 can be lifted to a second order differential equation for @xmath77 .",
    "this may come as a surprise as the lifting from @xmath52 to @xmath108 involves an integration leading _ a priori _ to a third order differential equation for @xmath77 .",
    "however , we show below that it is always possible to lift ( [ ydiff ] ) to a second order differential equation for @xmath77 provided we allow for an extra @xmath42-factor to appear in the action of @xmath72 on @xmath77 .",
    "define @xmath77 by    where @xmath109 is any section of the @xmath42-bundle and @xmath110 is the wronskian of @xmath109 and @xmath107 .",
    "differentiating ( [ fy ] ) with respect to @xmath96 gives    and thus @xmath77 satisfies ( [ gta ] ) .",
    "furthermore it is easy to see from ( [ ydiff ] ) and ( [ fy ] ) that @xmath77 satisfies a second order differential equation.the construction ( [ fy ] ) is in fact the only way to satisfy ( [ gta ] ) . indeed , from ( [ gta ] ) we conclude that    where @xmath16 is some @xmath42-section .",
    "the integral of ( [ atoy ] ) is precisely given by ( [ fy ] ) with @xmath109 satisfying the inhomogeneous form of ( [ ydiff ] )    the constant of integration must be set to zero for @xmath111 to transform homogeneously with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "note that the action of @xmath72 on @xmath77 is also that of monodromy transformations in @xmath96 .",
    "[ [ boundary - conditions ] ] boundary conditions : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to complete the construction we need to satisfy the boundary conditions given by the semiclassical contribution ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "we recall from ( [ compact ] ) and ( [ ydiff ] ) that    therefore    and hence    the constant @xmath49 is fixed by using the fact that the action of @xmath72 on @xmath52 corresponds to monodromy transformations in @xmath96 and by requiring that @xmath112 belongs to @xmath72 as shown in section @xmath7 .",
    "first due to the identifications on the real line , for large @xmath96 , @xmath113 is a monodromy transformation .",
    "under such a transformation @xmath114 .",
    "therefore @xmath49 is an integer .",
    "the condition @xmath115 leads then to @xmath116 .",
    "compatibility with the semiclassical relation ( [ tau ] ) then requires @xmath117 for large @xmath96 , which using ( [ fy ] ) and ( [ assy2 ] ) leads to    this completes the general construction of the vector @xmath118 . to summarize",
    "we have shown that the action of any equivalence group @xmath72 for @xmath52 can be lifted to the pair of functions @xmath89 and @xmath88 and furthermore the action is simply by monodromy transformations on @xmath100 with proper identifications . without further constraints",
    "the solution is in general not unique .",
    "indeed any fuchsian function @xmath101 mapping @xmath53 into a fundamental domain of @xmath72 and any @xmath42-section @xmath119 satisfying the boundary condition ( [ fg2 ] ) is a solution .",
    "as discussed in section @xmath7 , infinite mass for all ( possibly composite ) charged fields implies that the full @xmath2-theory is weakly coupled due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "therefore consistency requires that the mass @xmath66 of the lightest charged field diverges only in the perturbative regime .",
    "it turns out that the finite mass constraint puts a very strong condition on the set of solutions constructed in the last subsection .",
    "it is here also that the extra @xmath42-bundle introduced by the function @xmath109 in ( [ fg ] ) becomes important .",
    "we first observe that in order to be a @xmath42-section @xmath119 must behave in the vicinity of a singularity @xmath120 of @xmath109 as    ( at infinity @xmath121 ) .",
    "we now derive a lower bound for each @xmath122 from the finite mass condition .",
    "first we recall that the mass spectrum is given by @xmath123 and thus using ( [ fy ] ) @xmath124 .",
    "finiteness of the mass spectrum requires then that at least one component of @xmath125 be finite at a given finite point @xmath126 .",
    "now , if @xmath127 is regular at this point then @xmath105 and @xmath106 are also regular and then finiteness of @xmath67 implies either @xmath109 is regular at @xmath126 or @xmath109 has a singularity at @xmath126 with @xmath128 . if @xmath126 is a singularity of @xmath127 , ie .",
    "@xmath129 , then ( [ ydiff ] ) can be solved locally to give for @xmath130    where @xmath131 are the eigenvectors of the monodromy matrix @xmath132 . since    finiteness of the mass implies @xmath133 for @xmath134 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are linear combinations of @xmath135 and @xmath136 and the same analysis gives @xmath137 .",
    "thus the condition ( [ coa ] ) is also valid for this case . combining the above results we see that _ necessary _ conditions for finite @xmath67 are    where @xmath138 are the common singularities of @xmath109 and @xmath127 and @xmath139 are the points where @xmath109 is singular but @xmath127 is regular .      to proceed",
    "further we need a general theorem on residues , namely that the total residue i.e. the sum of the residues @xcite of a meromorphic form @xmath140 on a compact manifold is zero , @xmath141 where the integrations are taken along closed curves @xmath142",
    "associated with any triangulation of the manifold . applying this result to the moduli space @xmath54 , the form @xmath143 , which is meromorphic because @xmath109 is a section of a line bundle , and a triangulation of @xmath54 around all inequivalent poles and zeros of @xmath109 , we get @xmath144 the @xmath145 s in ( [ cc ] ) are due to the fact that singular points on the real line are pairwise identified .      an immediate consequence of ( [ cc ] ) is that @xmath109 can not have a singularity at a point where @xmath127 is regular because a single singularity of this kind would already saturate ( [ cc ] ) with @xmath146 from ( [ fg2 ] ) and @xmath101 has at least two singularities .",
    "hence we can restrict ourself to the first possibility in ( [ nes ] ) . using ( [ cc ] )",
    "we then obtain    the l.h.s . of ( [ rsum ] )",
    "is directly related to the index @xmath147 of @xmath72 in @xmath148 .",
    "the index @xmath147 is the order of the coset @xmath149 . to see the connection we endow the upper half plane @xmath53 with the @xmath150-invariant metric @xcite @xmath151 with this metric every copy of the fundamental domain @xmath152 of @xmath9 has the same area @xmath153 . since the fundamental domain @xmath84 is composed of @xmath154 copies of @xmath152 @xcite it has the area @xmath155 . on the other hand the area of @xmath84 , which is a polygon bounded by arcs with centers on the real line and which has one zero angle at infinity and @xmath98 further angles @xmath156 is @xcite @xmath157 .",
    "the equality of the two expressions obtained for the area of @xmath84 leads to the relation @xmath158 thus the condition ( [ rsum ] ) is equivalent to @xmath159 .",
    "it is shown in appendix @xmath24 , that the only subgroups of @xmath150 with index not greater than 3 and containing @xmath160 are @xmath161 and @xmath150 itself .",
    "@xmath9 is ruled out for the following reason .",
    "since @xmath162 the only @xmath109 consistent with ( [ cc ] ) has @xmath163 , @xmath164 , or vice versa .",
    "however , since @xmath46@xmath165 and @xmath46@xmath166 correspond to couplings @xmath52 that are identified by @xmath160 , @xmath109 can not have different indices at @xmath46@xmath165 and @xmath46@xmath166.for @xmath167 there are two sets of @xmath168 and @xmath169 : @xmath170 where we have chosen two singularities @xmath171 and @xmath172 to be @xmath4 and @xmath173 .",
    "these two solutions correspond to two different choices of the domain @xmath84 and are related by a coordinate transformation on the moduli space .",
    "it can be checked that the physical quantities such as the mass spectrum are scalars under this transformation.the @xmath167 solution just discussed is the sw solution .",
    "this may be surprising since the group found in @xcite is @xmath174 , whose index in @xmath148 is @xmath175 .",
    "this difference comes only from the fact that in sw description @xmath160 plays a distinct role and is not associated to a monodromy transformation of their moduli parameter @xmath61 . in other words",
    "@xmath174 is not the _ maximal _ equivalence group but a subgroup of it .",
    "more precisely , @xmath176 .",
    "the link between the @xmath167 and sw descriptions will be given more explicitly at the end of the next section .",
    "in this section we wish to consider the expectation value @xmath177 which , like @xmath67 has a direct physical meaning . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that within the instanton approximation    later it was shown in @xcite that ( [ tf ] ) was generally true as a direct consequence of the superconformal ward identities . in @xcite seiberg and witten conjectured that their moduli variable @xmath61 was identical with @xmath178 . that this is correct can be seen using the result",
    "@xcite which precisely states that the right hand side of ( [ tf ] ) equals @xmath61 . for this reason and for brevity",
    "we define @xmath179 .",
    "we now discuss the relation between @xmath61 and the moduli parameter @xmath96 in the general setting of the previous sections . for this",
    "we note from ( [ tf ] ) that @xmath180 using ( [ atoy ] ) we then have    where we have used ( [ fy ] ) and normalized the wronskian of @xmath106 and @xmath105 to be @xmath181 . in order to obtain @xmath182",
    "we need to integrate this identity ie .",
    "this is the required relation between @xmath61 and @xmath96 .",
    "next we show that the seiberg - witten solution is the unique solution for which @xmath61 is finite except for the asymptotic regime , even if we do not insist on the finite mass constraint . for this",
    "we note that , using ( [ fuc1 ] ) , the expression ( [ i3 ] ) is locally of the form @xmath183dz'&\\mbox{for } & z \\rightarrow a_i\\\\ \\\\ \\label{ft } \\int\\limits^z r_{z_0}(r_{z_0}-1)(z'-z_0)^{2r_{z_0}-2}dz'&\\mbox{for } & z\\rightarrow z_0 \\notin\\{a_i\\ } \\end{array}\\right\\}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath184 .    finiteness of @xmath61 then leads to the following conditions : 0.2truecm ( i ) to every singularity of @xmath127 corresponds a zero of @xmath109 . furthermore , either @xmath185 or @xmath186 . 0.2truecm",
    "( ii ) if @xmath109 has a singularity where @xmath127 is regular ie .",
    "@xmath187 , then @xmath188 .",
    "these conditions are rather similar to those obtained from the finite mass constraint . which is , perhaps , not too surprising because of the identity    which follows immediately from ( [ i3 ] ) and ( [ atoy ] ) ( [ fg ] ) .",
    "however , they differ in two small respects .",
    "first ( i ) permits a small range @xmath189 that is not permitted by the mass condition .",
    "second ( ii ) requires @xmath188 rather than @xmath190 .",
    "however , when we apply the boundary condition ( [ fg2 ] ) we find that the only solution permitted by ( i ) and ( ii ) which is not permitted by the finite mass constraint is    it is easy to see , however , that the map ( [ ce ] ) can not correspond to any subgroup of @xmath9",
    ". thus @xmath191 leads to exactly the same result as the finite mass constraint and therefore leads to a unique solution which is precisely the sw - solution .",
    "it then follows that @xmath192 is a good parameter for the moduli space .",
    "however , in this paper , in contrast to @xcite , this property of @xmath61 is not an assumption but a consequence of the finiteness of @xmath66 or @xmath61 itself .    finally , for @xmath167 the relation ( [ i2 ] ) can be explicitly integrated for the two cases ( [ fff ] ) and ( [ fff ] ) .",
    "it leads respectively to @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "moreover it follows then from ( [ ydiff ] ) and ( [ fy ] ) that for both cases @xmath195 satisfies the second order differential equation , which is just the differential equation obtained in @xcite for sw solution .",
    "we have proved that seiberg - witten ansatz is the unique solution for the low energy effective lagrangian of @xmath3-yang - mills theory , assuming only that supersymmetry is unbroken and that the number of singularities is finite .",
    "in particular the electromagnetic duality is derived , in contrast to the original paper @xcite where it was assumed .",
    "we have obtained a construction which lifts any @xmath148-structure .",
    "this construction is straightforward and based on simple differential equations .",
    "in particular it does not involve elliptic curves . on the other hand it generalizes the observations in @xcite and more recently @xcite where the connection with differential equations was explained for the particular case of the seiberg - witten solution .",
    "there is no reason why the present construction should not apply to theories including matter hypermultiplets .",
    "it therefore has the potential to resolve the puzzles arising there @xcite .",
    "the question of whether it can be extended to higher groups , where the complex dimension of the moduli space is bigger than @xmath4 is , however , still open .",
    "i.s . was partially supported by the swiss national science foundation .",
    "m.m . is grateful to the dublin institute for advanced studies for their kind hospitality .",
    "o.s . was supported in parts by the dfg graduiertenkolleg ` starke wechselwirkung ' and the bmbf .",
    "r.f acknowledges the support of volkswagenstiftung .",
    "i.s . is indebted to f. hirzenbruch for helpful comments on modular groups .",
    "in this appendix we prove some results on modular groups needed in the main body of the paper .",
    "first we recall some basic definitions and results @xcite.a modular transformation , is a transformation    it is called _ elliptic , hyperbolic _ or _",
    "parabolic _ corresponding to whether it has two fixed points in the upper half plane , two fixed points on the real axis or one fixed point at @xmath197 or on the real line .",
    "these three cases can equivalently be distinguished by the trace ( smaller , bigger or equal to @xmath7).for our purpose we restrict ourself to the inhomogeneous modular group    ( 2,*z*)=sl(2,*z*)/i \\{t , s } \\ {",
    "l t : + 1 + s : -    .",
    "mod    @xmath198 is isomorphic to the riemann sphere .",
    "more generally , if @xmath72 is a subgroup of @xmath9 of finite index , its fundamental domain @xmath199 is isomorphic to a compact riemann surface @xcite.next we prove the following theorem used in sections [ fmass ] and [ uvar ] .  _",
    "the only subgroups of @xmath150 with index less or equal 3 and containing @xmath160 are : @xmath200 _    * proof : * first we recall @xcite that @xmath201 . if @xmath202 then @xmath203 otherwise @xmath204 defines one coset of @xmath72 . in this case",
    "moreover @xmath206 , otherwise @xmath207 , thus @xmath208 .",
    "so @xmath209 defines another coset of @xmath72 and @xmath72 is of index @xmath12 .",
    "consider @xmath210 .",
    "it has to belong to one of the cosets @xmath72 , @xmath204 or @xmath211 .",
    "but @xmath212 , otherwise @xmath213 . moreover @xmath214 .",
    "hence @xmath215 . therefore @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "@xmath218    epsf",
    "in order to discuss the relation between the @xmath8-vacuum and duality , we need the following result on fundamental domains : let @xmath152 be the usual fundamental domain of @xmath148 given in figure 1 . because @xmath219 , it follows that @xmath220 .",
    "therefore @xmath84 contains @xmath221 or a copy of @xmath221 obtained by applying some element @xmath16 of @xmath72 to @xmath221 .",
    "the image of @xmath222 under a modular transformation is either on the real line or at @xmath223 .",
    "however , the latter possibility leads to @xmath224 for some integer @xmath98 which implies again that @xmath225 .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath84 has a vertex on the real line .",
    "@xmath226    vertices on the real line always correspond to zero angles ie .",
    "parabolic substitutions ie .",
    "trace @xmath7 . > from the above it then follows in particular that any solution for the low energy effective lagrangian which respects the existence of the @xmath8-parameter , either has the monodromy group @xmath9 or otherwise the fundamental domain has at least @xmath4 parabolic vertex in addition to the parabolic point at infinity .",
    "the corresponding monodromy , does not commute with the monodromy at infinity . on the other hand it is conjugate ( in @xmath148 ) to the point at infinity .",
    "consequently , there is at least @xmath4 point in the vacuum manifold which is dual ( conjugate ) to to the weak coupling singularity .",
