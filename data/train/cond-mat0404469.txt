    "the instantaneous normal modes ( inm ) of a liquid are the eigenvectors of the hessian ( second derivative ) matrix of the potential energy , evaluated at an instantaneous configuration .",
    "the interest in the equilibrium - average properties of the inm originates in the proposal @xcite to use them to study liquid dynamical properties , especially diffusion , which is considered to be linked to unstable modes ( a subset of the modes with negative eigenvalue ) @xcite .",
    "they have been naturally applied to address the problem of the glass transition : the glass phase is viewed as that where free ( _ i.e. _ non - activated ) diffusion is absent , and the disappearance of diffusion should be linked to that of the unstable modes @xcite .",
    "the identification of these unstable modes presents some problems @xcite , and the localization properties of the inm are of interest .",
    "this is the problem we address here .",
    "localization is an interesting and difficult problem in its own right .",
    "given an @xmath0 random matrix defined by the probability distribution of its elements in some ( typically site ) base , the problem is to determine whether an eigenmode projects to an extensive number of base vectors ( extended state ) or not ( localized state ) in the large @xmath1 limit . only in a few cases",
    "there is a theoretical solution for this problem  @xcite . from the point of view of random matrix theory ,",
    "the inm are the eigenvectors of an euclidean random matrix ( erm )  @xcite , and the problem of localization in erms has been recently addressed analytically in the dilute limit  @xcite . clearly , the problem is also hard from the numerical point of view , involving a question about the thermodynamic limit .",
    "quantities such as the participation ratio  @xcite , which can distinguish between localized and extended states but require knowledge of the eigenvectors , are problematic numerically because computation of eigenvectors is very expensive for large systems .    here",
    "we explore an approach  @xcite relying only on eigenvalues , based on the fact that the statistics of level spacing is strongly correlated with the nature of the eigenmodes ( see sec .",
    "we apply it for the first time to a model glass - forming liquid at a temperature below the mode coupling temperature @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "our work can be regarded as an extension of the results of ref .  , as far as we perform a detailed analysis of the level spacing .",
    "our emphasis is on the exploring the usefulness of level - spacing statistics as a means to obtain a localization threshold in off - lattice systems and the possible limitations of this technique .",
    "the spectral function of the eigenvalues of a random matrix is @xmath3 .",
    "its ( disorder- ) average is the density of states @xmath4 ( dos ) .",
    "the cumulative spectral function for this particular realization of the disorder , @xmath5 can be decomposed into a smooth part plus a fluctuating term @xmath6 , whose average is zero .",
    "the smooth part is then @xmath7    the level spacing is not studied directly on the @xmath8 , because it depends on the mean level density . to eliminate this dependence , one `` unfolds '' the spectrum , which means to map the original sequence @xmath9 onto a new one @xmath10 according to eq .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed explanation of this point ) . the cumulative spectral function can be expressed in terms of these new variables : @xmath11 the distribution of the variable @xmath12 is uniform in the interval @xmath13 $ ] regardless the @xmath4 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath14 gives the probability that two _ neighboring _ unfolded eigenvalues @xmath15 and @xmath16 are separated by @xmath17 .",
    "it is one of the most commonly used observables in random matrix theory .",
    "it is different from the two level correlation function and it involves all the @xmath18-level correlation functions with @xmath19 @xcite . it displays a high degree of universality , exhibiting common properties in systems with very different spectra .",
    "although no general proof has been given , its shape is thought to depend only on the localization properties of the states  @xcite . in the case of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , where all states are extended in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", it is known  @xcite that @xmath14 , normalized such that @xmath20 , follows the so - called _ wigner surmise _ ( also known as wigner - dyson statistics ) , namely @xmath21 the linear behavior for small @xmath17 is an expression of the level repulsion .",
    "this form actually characterizes many different systems with extended eigenstates ( see _ e.g. _ ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "in the case of inm , it has been shown @xcite that it describes the level spacing better and better as the fraction of localized states decreases .",
    "on the other hand , a system whose states are all localized will have completely uncorrelated eigenvalues .",
    "this corresponds to a poisson process , and the statistics of two adjacent levels is given by @xmath22 if one deals with a set of levels which includes both localized and extended states , one expects some distribution interpolating between those two .",
    "a natural ansatz is the simple linear combination @xmath23 which holds under the hypothesis that contributions coming from localized and extended modes simply add linearly .",
    "another possibility comes from a statistical argument due to wigner ( see for example  @xcite ) , that leads to the heuristic function @xmath24 where @xmath25 is called _ level repulsion function_. taking @xmath26 , with @xmath27 $ ] , one obtains the brody distribution  @xcite @xmath28}{q+1 } ,    \\label{brody}\\ ] ] which interpolates between the poisson ( @xmath29 ) and wigner - dyson ( @xmath30 ) distributions .",
    "however , this is just another phenomenological interpolation scheme , since there is no theoretical argument supporting a level repulsion function increasing as a power law with an exponent smaller than one .",
    "the practical difficulty in performing the unfolding lies in finding a good approximation to the smooth ( averaged ) part of the cumulative spectral function , @xmath31 . we have first obtained a cumulative function averaged over many samples of the hessian ( computed from a corresponding number of equilibrium configurations ) and then taken @xmath31 as the function defined by a cubic spline interpolation of the resulting staircase .",
    "once this function is defined , the spacings of each sample can be evaluated by extracting the @xmath32 values according to the @xmath4 and then computing @xmath33 ; the histogram of these values is an estimate of the @xmath14 .",
