    "the natural quantity for these investigations has been introduced by peres in his seminal paper of 1984 @xcite . called later as loschmidt echo ( le ) or fidelity , it measures the ability of a system to return to an initial state @xmath0 after a forward evolution with a hamiltonian @xmath1 followed by an imperfect reversal evolution with a perturbed hamiltonian @xmath2 ( @xmath3 parameterize the strength of the perturbation ) .",
    "thus , it is given by @xmath4 \\exp [ -{\\rm i } h_{0 } t ] \\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle |^{2 } \\label{eq - overlap}\\ ] ] ( throughout the paper @xmath5 is set equal to 1 ) .",
    "the le compares the evolution of an initial state with slightly different hamiltonians and can distinguish regular and chaotic classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "the le was recently studied in various chaotic systems using several approaches @xcite .",
    "however , few types of decay were discussed in the literature . for a very short time , it is straightforward to show that the le has a parabolic behavior @xmath6 , with @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "this decay is better resembled by the gaussian function @xmath8 $ ] , with characteristic time @xmath9 .",
    "though this regime has experimental relevance @xcite , it has not been extensively taken into account .",
    "after this short time decay , a crossover to a perturbation dependent regime was predicted and numerically observed @xcite .",
    "for very small @xmath3 , in which a typical matrix element @xmath10 of the perturbation is smaller than the mean level spacing @xmath11 , the decay is always gaussian until @xmath12 reaches its asymptotic values @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 , this regime has an exponential decay @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the width of the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "this is usually called fermi golden rule regime ( fgr ) . when @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the mean lyapunov exponent of the classical system , a perturbation independent regime is observed . in this case , the decay rate is given by @xmath18 .",
    "finally , if @xmath16 exceeds the bandwidth of the perturbation , the le has a gaussian decay .",
    "the properties of the initial state play an important role in the behavior of the le @xcite .",
    "this point can be relevant to observe the mentioned regimes .",
    "for example , the lyapunov regime is not displayed if the initial state is an eigenfunction of the unperturbed / perturbed hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "localized wave packets are needed to observe this regime . on the other hand",
    ", zurek has recently stated that dynamical evolution causes that these states develop a sub - planck structures in phase space , and he predicts that these structures enhance their sensitivity to perturbations @xcite .",
    "in this article we are mainly interested in the short time decay of the le .",
    "disregarding system specific features and the correlations imposed by the characteristics of initial state , we show via perturbation theory that @xmath19 is given by the width @xmath16 of the ldos . in order to see the validity of this result in a realistic model , we study the characteristic time @xmath20 in a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos , a 2-d chaotic billiard perturbed by a contour deformation . we regard the influences of the characteristics of the perturbation and the initial condition to this important regime .",
    "therefore , we consider different perturbations and various types of initial conditions in our numerical study .",
    "we find that some perturbations , which we call _ generic _ , destroy correlations imposed by the initial condition giving that @xmath21 .",
    "nevetheless , other perturbations do not act in that way and this fact produces a slower decay with @xmath22 . in this context",
    ", we discuss the influence of an initial time evolution of the wave packet and the corresponding developed structures in phase space in the short time decay of the le .",
    "in fact , it is shown that an initial dynamical evolution helps to erase the mentioned correlations , with the effect of increasing @xmath19 .",
    "if the initial evolved time is smaller than the ehrenfest time , the enhanced decay is described entirely by the classical streaching arround the unstable manifold given by the lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "but for greater evolved times , the quantum interference lead a developed sub - planck structure in phase space and this yield that the decay continuos growing .",
    "that is , the sensitivity to perturbations is also enhanced in this case ( as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , if the perturbation produces a decay with @xmath23 the developed structures in phase space do not influence the short time decay .",

    "we note that these results could be of importance for the understanding of the measure of the le in recent nmr experiments @xcite .",
