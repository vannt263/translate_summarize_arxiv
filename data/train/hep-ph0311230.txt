    "recently five experiments announced discovery of a narrow , exotic baryonic state called @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "most probably this state belongs to the positive parity baryon antidecuplet , which naturally emerges in chiral soliton models @xcite .",
    "early prediction of its mass @xcite obtained in the skyrme model @xcite extended to three flavors @xcite is in surprising agreement with the present experimental findings .",
    "moreover , if the discovery of the heaviest members of the antidecuplet , @xmath5 , announced by na49 collaboration @xcite at 1860 mev is confirmed , again the same model will be off only by 70 mev @xcite .",
    "however , the most striking experimental result is perhaps a very small width @xmath6 which is estimated to be of the order of a few tens mev or less @xcite .",
    "such a narrow width was predicted in a seminal paper by diakonov , petrov and polyakov @xcite within the su(3 ) chiral quark soliton model ( @xmath7qsm ) .",
    "the smallness of @xmath6 in this model is due to the cancellation of the coupling constants which enter the collective decay operator .",
    "it is , however , at first sight to some extent unnatural that the cancellation occurs between the constants which are of different order in the number of colors , @xmath8 . if only the leading term were retained , the width of @xmath0 would be of the same order as @xmath9 @xcite .    in this note",
    "we show that in fact this cancellation occurs order by order in @xmath8 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the additional factor of @xmath8 appears when one properly takes into account the su(3 ) flavor representation content of the lowest lying baryonic states . indeed , for arbitrary number of colors",
    ", baryons do not fall into ordinary flavor octet , decuplet and antidecuplet , but are members of large su(3 ) representations @xcite , which reduce to the standard ones only for @xmath10 .",
    "taking this extra @xmath8 dependence into account makes the su(3 ) clebsch - gordan coefficients depend on @xmath8 .",
    "we also find that group - theoretical factors suppress @xmath11 with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "this suppression is , however , `` undone '' by the phase space factor , which scales differently with @xmath1 in the chiral limit .",
    "both in the skyrme model @xcite and in the @xmath7qsm @xcite baryons emerge as rotational states of the symmetric top which rotates in the su(3 ) collective space @xcite .",
    "this rotation is described in terms of a rotational su(3 ) matrix @xmath12 .",
    "baryonic wave functions @xcite are given as su(3 ) wigner @xmath13 matrices  @xcite : @xmath14 in this notation @xmath15 with @xmath16 being hypercharge , @xmath17 and @xmath18 isospin and its third component . left index @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a state conjugate to @xmath21 .",
    "the fact that the right index runs only over the su(2 ) subspace of the su(3 ) representation @xmath22 follows from the form of the hedgehog ansatz for the static soliton field and the wess - zumino term @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 is the charge of state @xmath21 .",
    "note that under the action of left ( flavor ) generators @xmath24 @xmath25 transforms like a tensor in representation @xmath22 , while under the right generators @xmath26 like a tensor in @xmath27 rather than @xmath22 .    .",

    ". therefore we shall denote a complex conjugate by a @xmath36:@xmath37 for large representations like ( [ reps ] ) physical flavor states have hypercharge different from the one in the real world , however isospin , charge and strangeness take the physical values .",
    "this is depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "baryon masses are given in terms of the effective hamiltonian@xmath38 where @xmath39 is the casimir operator for representation @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the classical soliton mass .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that in the chiral limit nonexotic splittings scale like @xmath42 while exotic - nonexotic like @xmath43 , e.g.:@xmath44 the fact that @xmath45 mass difference is of the order of 1 was used to argue that the rigid - rotor quantization of the chiral soliton is not valid for exotic states @xcite .",
    "the discussion of this point is beyond the scope of the present paper , let us however note , that arguments have been also given in favor of the rigid - rotor quantization @xcite despite eq.([ncscaling ] )",

    "first of all , and this is our main result announced in the introduction , for @xmath0 decay constant @xmath82 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath8 and therefore the second term in eq.([mthav ] ) is of the same order as @xmath83 .",
    "these two terms cancel against each other yielding numerically @xmath0 width much smaller than the width of @xmath3 .",
    "this cancellation is therefore consistent with @xmath8 counting and justifies the use of nonleading terms in the decay operator ( [ op ] ) .",
    "secondly , the overall factor in front of @xmath84 \\times p^{2}$ ] is @xmath43 for @xmath76 and @xmath85 for @xmath78 .",
    "this effect , as can be seen from es.([ddcy],[thdec ] ) , is entirely due to the  spin  part of the matrix elements @xmath86 . indeed , flavor clebsch - gordan coefficients in es.([ddcy],[thdec ] ) scale as @xmath43 with @xmath8 , as can be inferred from es.([hw ] ) .",
    "this is , however , not a complete @xmath8 dependence , since momentum @xmath87 also depends on @xmath8 .",

    "in the chiral limit @xmath89@xmath90 since the difference @xmath91 scales differently with @xmath8 for @xmath3 and @xmath0 decays ( [ ncscaling]):@xmath92 and the overall scaling for the widths reads@xmath93    it is interesting to ask at this point how well the @xmath1 scaling arguments work numerically in nature . for the mass differences we get ( assuming @xmath94 , @xmath95  mev , which gives @xmath96  mev for the average antidecuplet mass ) : @xmath97 ( in mev ) which is in a reasonable agreement with an expected factor of @xmath98 , see eq.([ncscaling ] ) .",
    "as far as the phase - space factor is concerned , the physical value of the meson momentum reads ( in mev ) @xmath99 and it is hard to argue that the scaling of eq.([pscale0 ] ) really holds . formally for @xmath100 meson momentum @xmath87 scales in both cases @xcite as @xmath43 . in that case:@xmath101 which would explain parametrically the narrowness of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath3",
    "coupling constants @xmath102 are related to the axial couplings through goldberger - treiman relation . on the other hand we know explicit model formulae for these couplings @xcite:@xmath103 up to the same proportionality factor of the order of @xmath104 .",
    "explicit formulae and numerical values of the inertia parameters @xmath105 and @xmath17 can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "if in the @xmath7qsm one artificially sets the soliton size @xmath106 , then the model reduces to the free valence quarks which , however ,  remember  the soliton structure @xcite . in this limit ,",

    "our primary goal was to show that the cancellation which takes place in the case of the @xmath4 width is consistent with the @xmath8 counting . indeed , by employing correct generalizations of standard su(3 ) representations for arbitrary number of colors",
    ", we have shown that there is additional @xmath8 enhancement of the constant @xmath82 which is formally one power of @xmath8 less than @xmath83 .",
    "this enhancement comes entirely from the spin part of the matrix elements @xmath115 and carries over to the decays of all particles in antidecuplet .",
    "we have also found that there is @xmath85 suppression factor in the @xmath4 width with respect to @xmath3 , coming from the same source , namely from the @xmath8 dependence of the su(3)@xmath116 glebsch - gordan coefficients .",

    "this kind of  noncommutativity  of the chiral limit and large @xmath8 expansion is well known and there are many examples where it creates problems .    finally , we have shown that in the nonrelativistic quark model limit , i.e. in the limit where we artificially squeeze the soliton , the cancellation in the decay strength for @xmath4 is exact and occurs independently at each order of @xmath8 . in this",
