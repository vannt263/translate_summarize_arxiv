    "@xmath20 is consistent with results from @xcite at @xmath149 which might suggest that the carla lower richness clusters at this redshift are similar to the iscs clusters studied @xcite .    only considering the highest richness sample of carla clusters results in a monotonically increasing @xmath5 , with @xmath5 @xmath39",

    "this secondary peak contains about @xmath157% of the objects .",
    "similarly , @xcite derives a mean age of low - mass objects of low redshift galaxy clusters to be about 4 gyrs in low - redshift clusters .",
    "although their observation suggests a decline of star - forming galaxies and a trend of downsized galaxy formation , low mass galaxies are still assembling until relatively recent times .",

    "we therefore investigate the extent to which our results can be explained by a sum of various stellar populations to estimate the maximum fraction of a star - forming cluster population that is still consistent with the data .",
    "we divide the cluster population into two stellar populations , a simple stellar population ( ssp ) with a delta - burst of star formation at high redshift and a composite stellar population ( csp ) with a continuous , only slowly decaying star - formation rate of the form @xmath158 and large @xmath159 .",
    "the details of the three different model sets we derive are as follows :    * model 1 : sum of ssp with @xmath160 and csp with @xmath160 and @xmath161 gyr with ratios ( ssp : csp ) ranging between 90:10 and 0:100 by mass .",

    "a prolonged mass assembly means that at high redshift the observed @xmath0 m magnitude of galaxies is fainter because the stellar population is still forming .",
    "therefore , accounting for mass assembly , i.e. allowing for star - forming population to contribute to the observed @xmath5 , causes @xmath5 to become fainter at high redshift depending on the contribution of this star - forming population .    in figure [ models ] we show these models in the context of our results .",
    "they allow us to set an upper limit on the star - forming fraction , @xmath164 , in our candidate cluster sample .",
    "model 1 , which allows for a significant star formation that is only very slowly decaying with cosmic time , shows that at all redshifts the mass fraction of the star - forming population can not be larger than 40% ( with one outlying exception of up to 60% at @xmath165 ) . in model 2",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the csp decays faster and the contribution of the ssp becomes dominant much earlier than in model 1 .",
    "it therefore predicts @xmath5 to be brighter at high redshifts and resemble the prediction of the passive evolution model .",
    "consequently , our empirical results are in agreement with large contributions of up to 90% of the csp in model 2 , with the csp starting to passively evolve @xmath166 gyrs earlier ( at @xmath165 ) than in model 1 ( at @xmath167 ) .",
    "model 3 shows the evolution of a mixed population with a delta burst of star formation at @xmath168 ( ssp ) and a long burst of star formation at @xmath160 ( csp with @xmath169 gyrs ) .",
    "the ssp with @xmath163 is fainter in irac2 at @xmath170 than a ssp with @xmath160 , so that an additional starburst at @xmath171 leads to an even fainter @xmath5 at @xmath172 for model 3 .",
    "model 3 does not reproduce the results of the lf analysis and therefore this scenario can be ruled out by the data .",
    "this shows that the results for the evolution of @xmath5 obtained in this analysis ",
    "although consistent with passive evolution models  also allow for a limited contribution of a star - forming population in galaxy clusters .",
    "our models show that this contribution is small ( up to 40 % by mass , but probably on average around @xmath173 % ) for a population with a high and slowly decaying star - formation rate , or that this contribution is large ( up to 80% ) for a population with a fast decaying sfr and an evolution that resembles passive evolution @xmath166 gyrs earlier .    for a sample of 10 rich clusters at @xmath174 @xcite",

    "spitzer _ @xmath177 m imaging for the same cluster sample , @xcite analysed the obscured star formation as a function of redshift , stellar mass and clustercentric radius .",
    "they find that the transition period between the era where cluster galaxies are significantly quenched relative to the field and the era where the sfr is similar to that of field galaxies occurs at @xmath178 .",
    "combining these measurements with other independent results on that sample @xcite , the authors conclude that major mergers contribute significantly to the observed star formation history and that merger - fueled agn feedback may be responsible for the rapid truncation between @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "while the iscs clusters studied in @xcite and @xcite were selected from a field survey as 3-d overdensities using a photometric redshift wavelet analysis , the clusters studied here are found in the vicinity of rlagn . with rlagn belonging to the most massive galaxies in the universe ( @xmath181 m@xmath182 ;",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these clusters could reside in the largest dark matter halos , deepest potential wells and densest environments .",
    "indeed , @xcite derives halo masses for 5700 radio - loud agn from the data release 4 of the sloan digital sky survey and finds the halo masses of these radio - loud agn to be about twice as massive as those of control galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has shown that more massive black holes seem to trigger radio jets more easily , but as this boost in halo mass is independent of radio luminosity , the authors conclude that the larger - scale environment of the rlagn must play a crucial role for the rlagn phenomenon .",
    "similarly , albeit at higher redshift , hatch et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    "finds that the environments of carla rlagn are significantly denser than similarly massive quiescent galaxies .",
    "they detect a weak positive correlation between the black - hole mass and the environmental density on mpc - scales , suggesting that even at high redshift the growth of the black hole is also linked to collapse of the surrounding cluster .",
    "this peculiar interplay between radio jet triggering , stellar mass , black hole and halo mass of the rlagn and the larger - scale environment suggest that ( proto-)clusters and the large - scale environments of rlagn are distinct from clusters found in field surveys .    if mergers are significantly contributing to the transition of clusters from unquenched to quenched systems , as suggested in @xcite , this transition redshift will be dependent on cluster halo mass .",
    "if the environments and dark matter halos around radio - loud agn are indeed more massive this would explain the conflict of our results with those from @xcite .",
    "carla clusters have probably undergone this transition period much earlier than the iscs clusters . at @xmath183 where the star - forming fraction of iscs clusters analysed by @xcite still seems to be very high ( @xmath176% ) ,",
    "this contribution is already much smaller in carla clusters . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "our measurements allow us to derive upper limits on the contribution of a star - forming population but do not allow for a definite constraint on the transition redshift .",
    "we have shown the evolution of the mid - ir luminosity function for a large sample of galaxy cluster candidates at @xmath1 located around rlagn .",
    "all cluster candidates in this work were identified as mid - ir color - selected galaxy overdensities , a selection that is independent of galaxy type and evolutionary stage .",
    "@xcite has shown that indeed these excess color - selected sources are centered on the rlagn , implying they are associated .",
    "there is a steep increase of density toward the rlagn which would not be seen if there was not a physical link between the galaxies in the field and the agn .",
    "we therefore expect most of these overdensities to be true galaxy ( proto)-clusters .",
    "having neither spectroscopic nor photometric redshifts at hand , this study relies on statistics with 10 to 30 clusters per redshift bin .",
    "we have shown that our results are consistent with theoretical passive galaxy evolution models up to @xmath184 .",
    "@xcite measured significant deviation from these passive galaxy evolution models in their highest redshift bins ( @xmath29 ) , which correspond to our lowest redshift bins .",

    "carla clusters our results in the lowest redshift bins ( @xmath29 , free @xmath20 ) are consistent with what has been found in @xcite for their @xmath28 clusters and shows that the lower richness carla clusters are probably more similar to the clusters analysed in @xcite .",

    "due to the short @xmath187folding timescales these models are effectively passively evolving .    because carla clusters in the highest redshift bins ( @xmath145 ) are likely not progenitors of those at lower redshift ( @xmath23 ) and because uncertainties in @xmath5 are large we can not constrain the evolution of the mass fraction of the star - forming population .",
