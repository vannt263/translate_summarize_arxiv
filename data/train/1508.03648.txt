    "although the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ( and cosmology ) contains all the three ingredients for baryogenesis : baryon number violation , @xmath4 and @xmath5 violation , and the out - of - equilibrium condition @xcite , it eventually fails and new physics is called for @xcite .",
    "clearly these ingredients are necessary but not sufficient .",
    "moreover , the early universe is filled with particles of different types that interact with each other at various rates , rendering it a daunting task to analyze them . in this work",
    ", i would like to advocate the use of _ symmetry _ as an organizing principle to analyze such a system .",
    "in particular , i will show that by identifying the symmetries of a system , one can relate the asymmetries of all the particles to the corresponding conserved charges without having to take into account details of how those particles interact .",
    "this should not come as a surprise since symmetry dictates physics : when we specify a symmetry and how particles transform under it , the interactions are automatically fixed .",

    "finally the reactions of type ( iii ) should be described by nonequilibrium formalism like boltzmann equation in order to obtain quantitative prediction . in this work ,",
    "the effective symmetries concern both reactions of types ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "in particular gauge symmetry always belongs to type ( ii ) and can play an interesting role as ` _ _ messenger _ _ ' . if an approximate symmetry belongs to type ( ii ) , it can acquire a role as a ` _ _ messenger _ _ ' or ` _ _ preserver _ _ ' while if it is of type ( iii ) , it can act as ` _ _ creator / destroyer _ _ ' .    to understand the roles of @xmath6 alluded to above , it is illuminating to group the charges as follows . among all the charges",

    "hence even if @xmath69 sector does not carry baryon charge @xmath76 , as long as it carries charges in the messenger sector @xmath77 , and some baryons also carry charges in the messenger sector @xmath78 , we will have @xmath79 . here",
    "sector can play two roles : as creator / destroyer or preserver of asymmetries depending on their rates as discussed in the beginning of this section . in short ,",
    "the roles of @xmath6 symmetries in baryogenesis can be concisely stated as follows :    1 .",
    "_ creator / destroyer _ : type ( iii ) reaction with an approximate @xmath80",
    ". the dynamical violation of @xmath80 results in the development of @xmath81 from @xmath82 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , quantitative prediction requires one to solve dynamical equation like boltzmann equation for @xmath83 and the generated asymmetry depends on the rates of _ creation _ and _ washout_. 2 .   _ preserver _ : type ( ii ) reaction with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the symmetry prevents the asymmetry from being washed out .",
    "the lightest electrically neutral particle in this sector can be a good ( asymmetric ) dark matter candidate .",
    "messenger _ : type ( ii ) reaction with @xmath84 and @xmath62 .",
    "further requirement is that at least some particles in @xmath80 ( of the preserver or the creator / destroyer ) and some baryons need to be charged under @xmath84 such that a nonzero asymmetry in @xmath80 induces a nonzero baryon asymmetry through @xmath84 conservation .    in the sm , conservations of hypercharge @xmath85 and electric charge @xmath86",
    "ensure @xmath87 .",
    "hence they play the role of messenger respectively before and after ew phase transition ( ewpt ) at @xmath88 .",
    "( [ eq : baryon_asymmetry2 ] ) is the generalization of the result of ref .",
    "@xcite which shows that a preserved sector which carries nonzero hypercharge asymmetry implies nonzero baryon asymmetry ( set @xmath89 in the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : baryon_asymmetry2 ] ) ) .",
    "we can readily extend this result to post - ew - sphaleron baryogenesis scenario @xcite where @xmath86 plays the role of messenger . in this case",
    ", baryon asymmetry can not be erased by fast @xmath90-violating interactions as long as there is a preserved sector carrying nonzero electric charge asymmetry .",
