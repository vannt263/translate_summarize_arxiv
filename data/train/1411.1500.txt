    "study for quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite by ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite provides an opportunity to understand the production mechanism of strangeness hadrons and the phase space evolution in the system created , especially the energy dependence is thought as one of important observables to study various aspects of the qcd phase diagram @xcite in the beam energy scan program at rhic @xcite .",
    "the s - quarks in strangeness hadrons can be a good probe to investigate the properties of the high dense and temperature matter because there should be no net strangeness content in the colliding system @xcite .",
    "the s - quarks are all created in the reaction .",
    "kaon is produced associated with @xmath0-hyperon at fopi energy , and at higher energies , such as in the rhic or lhc region , it can be produced by another mechanism , the so - called pair production  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath3 distribution encodes rich physics information .",
    "it has been measured in p + p , p + nuclues or nucleus + nucleus collisions at different energy range by the fopi  @xcite and kaos  @xcite collaboration at @xmath4 gev , by the rhic - star collaboration at @xmath5 62 gev  @xcite and 200 gev  @xcite and by the lhc - alice collaboration  @xcite at @xmath5 2.76 and 7 tev etc .",
    "the resonance decay effect is also discussed in the above papers  @xcite . through fitting the measured transverse momentum @xmath3 distribution by a blast wave model  @xcite",
    ", one can investigate the properties of the collision system at kinetic freeze - out stage .",
    "the temperature @xmath1 parameter and the radial flow at kinetic freeze - out stage can provide some information about the evolution of the expanding phase space .",
    "one can also study if the system has reached kinetic equilibrium stage when the hadron interactions completed .",
    "the resonances decay will change the production rate and the @xmath3 distribution of kaon and @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the effect quantitatively in experiment .",
    "the blast wave model has been applied in experimental analysis  @xcite to study the kinetic freeze - out properties .",
    "retiere and lisa  @xcite have explored in detail an analytic parameterization of the freeze - out configuration and investigated the spectra , the collective flow , and the hbt correlation of the hadrons produced in head - on nuclear collisions at top rhic energy .",
    "in addition , the dragon  @xcite and the therminator2  @xcite models have been developed to study the phase - space distribution of produced hadrons at freeze - out stage . in this paper",
    ", we carry out a detailed study on the beam energy dependence of kaon and @xmath0 production based on a blast - wave model .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions of kaon and @xmath0 are presented .",
    "the chemical and kinetic freeze - out parameters are consistent with the ones extracted from experimental data .",
    "the resonance decay effect is also investigated and an approximate estimation of the percent of kaon and @xmath0 from resonance decay to total kaon and @xmath0 is achieved .",
    "as discussed above , within the framework of the blast - wave model , the fireball created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium and expands at a four - component velocity @xmath6 .",
    "the phase - space distribution of hadrons emitted from the expanding fireball can be expressed as a wigner function  @xcite    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the spin , rapidity , and transverse mass of the hadron , respectively , and @xmath11 is the four - component momentum . equation  ( [ eq : blwwigner ] ) is formulated in a lorentz covariant way , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polar coordinates , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the pseudorapidity and the proper time , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 with ( @xmath18 ) standing for the coordinates in the transverse plane and @xmath19 being the average transverse radius .",
    "the kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath1 and the radial flow parameter @xmath2 are important in determining the transverse momentum spectrum",
    ". and the latter will affect the four - component velocity field .",
    "since we are currently interested in the @xmath20 spectrum at mid - rapidity , the pseudorapidity distribution @xmath21 is not important .",
    "the @xmath3 spectrum can then be written as @xmath22 a thermal equilibrium model is employed to calculated the chemical components of hadrons . the particle density of species _",
