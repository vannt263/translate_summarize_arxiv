    "the orbital magnetism of bloch electrons has been an outstanding problem in solid state physics , and attracted renewed interest due to the recent recognition @xcite that the berry phase effect plays a very important role in the orbital magnetism .",

    "the orbital magnetic moment characterizes the rotation of the wave packet around its centroid and is given by @xmath4=@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the charge of the electron and @xmath7 is the velocity operator . by writing the wave packet in terms of the bloch state ,",

    "equation ( [ e1 ] ) can be alternatively derived by taking the differential of the electron energy , which within first order in the perturbative magnetic field @xmath14 turns to be @xmath15=@xmath16 , with respect to @xmath14 .",

    "also the orbital magnetism was recently studied by use of two - dimensional ( 2d ) haldane model and ferromagnetic _ kagom _ lattice with spin chirality @xcite .",
    "these two models are rare examples to show the zero - field quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite . from ref .",
    "@xcite one learns that the berry phase effect causes the om to display different behavior in metallic and insulating regions .",
    "this difference may be explained in parallel with haldane s recent finding @xcite of the berry phase effect in the intrinsic hall conductivity [ including qhe and anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) ] .",
    "the objective of the present paper is dual .",
    "first we remark that the berry phase effect on the orbital magnetism has been included in the well - known kubo - streda formula @xcite .",
    "therefore , a full quantum - mechanical linear response theory of the om can be developed as a useful complement of the semiclassical formalism , although the latter looks more elegant and practical for calculation on clean samples",
    ". then we examine the 3d problem by studying the orbital magnetism in antiferromagnets on the distorted face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) lattice .",
    "the results reveal that a general _ topological orbital magnetism theory _  that takes into account berry phase effect must now be developed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we address that the intrinsic om given in the semiclassical formalism is consistent with the well - known quantum - mechanical kubo - streda formula in the clean - sample limit .",
    "section iii describes the physical model that is used in this work .",
    "the topological property and the consequent intrinsic hall effect associated with the model are also given in this section . in sec .",
    "iv , we present a detailed study of the properties of the om and its effects on transport response in antiferromagnets on the distorted fcc lattice . finally , in sec . v we present our conclusions .",
    "due to the above mentioned modification of the density of states , the particle number in the weak magnetic field ( say , along @xmath36-axis ) is given by @xmath37 it is easy to see that a link between eq .",

    "note that although @xmath58 is a fermi - surface term , the quantity @xmath59 is a fermi - sea term and all the bloch states below @xmath23 should be accounted when calculating the om . on the other side , in the clean limit",

    "( [ e3 ] ) can actually be written as a kubo - streda formula:@xmath64 the other two components @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given in a similar manner .",
    "this equivalence between the semiclassical and quantum - mechanical description for the om is only valid in the intrinsic region and will break down when the impurity scattering effect is included .",
    "thus while the semiclassical formula of the om is more suitably employed to study the intrinsic property of the om , the kubo - streda formula must be used when one takes into account the impurity scattering .",
    "another aspect is that the kubo - streda formula is valid in arbitrary strength of the external magnetic field , while the semiclassical formula only works in the weak field limit . in some special cases , for example ,",
    "when one wants to know the edge state effect on the om in a finite - size sample in a strong magnetic field @xmath67 @xcite , a more apparent approach can be employed by directly calculating the total free energy and then a finite - field om is obtained by a @xmath67-derivative of the free energy .",

    "the hall conductivity @xmath99 for lower / upper bands is quantized to be a product of @xmath213 and the following chern invariant@xmath214^{3}}d^{3}\\mathbf{k}\\omega_{n}^{z}% ( \\mathbf{k})=-\\frac{1}{2\\pi}c_{n}g_{z}. \\label{e23}%\\ ] ] when @xmath125 is varied from @xmath125=@xmath76 to @xmath125@xmath130@xmath76 , equation ( [ e23 ] ) breaks down , since the 2d chern number @xmath215 is now @xmath0-dependent by the presence of the additional two ( 3 + 1)d weyl fermions at @xmath132 . in this case , although the gap is opened at dirac points along the bz edge , the emergence of new weyl fermions contributes non - zero density of states in the gap .",

    "i.e. , when the chemical potential is in the mott gap , the hall conductivity vanishes due to the cancellation of the chern invariants of the upper and lower bands .",
    "as a consequence , the om in eq .",

    "this result is prominently different from that in ref .",

    "@xcite employed the kubo - streda formula in calculating the om . as we have shown above , however , the kubo - streda formula and the semiclassical formula give the same expression for the intrinsic om .",

    "one can see that initially the om rapidly decreases as the filling of the lower bands increases , arriving at a minimum at @xmath23=@xmath220 , a value corresponding to the top of the lower band .",
    "then , as the chemical potential continues to vary in the gap [ shaded region in fig .",

    "this behavior is due to the fact that the upper limit of the @xmath0-integral of @xmath29 is invariant as the chemical potential varies in the band gap . in the metallic region , however , since the occupied states varies with the chemical potential @xmath23 , thus @xmath28 also varies with @xmath23 , resulting in a decreasing slope shown in fig .",

    "interestingly , the expression for @xmath227 can be simplified at low temperature as the mott relation @xcite , @xmath231 thus one can see that the low - temperature nonzero ane is a fermi - surface berry phase effect .",
    "another unique feature of @xmath227 is its linear dependence of temperature .",
    "in summary , after pointing out the equivalence of the semiclassical approach and the quantum kubo - streda formula in description of the intrinsic orbital magnetization , we have theoretically studied the properties of the om in antiferromagnets on the distorted 3d fcc lattice .",

    "we have found that the om vanishes when the electron chemical potential is lies in the mott gap , which is in contrast with the results in ref .",
    "we have shown that the two parts @xmath28 and @xmath222 in the om oppose each other , and yield the paramagnetic and diamagnetic responses , respectively .",
    "in particular , due to its fermi - sea topological property , the magnetic susceptibility of @xmath222 remains to be a nonzero constant when the fermi energy is located in the energy gap .",
    "it has been further shown that the om displays distinct behavior in the metallic and chern - insulating regions , because of different roles @xmath28 and @xmath222 play in these two regions .",
