    "solar sail space craft use radiation pressure on a reflective sail that can be oriented relative to the sun - line for propulsion . with the recent success of the ikaros",
    "interplanetary solar sail mission @xcite and the upcoming launch of the sunjammer mission such craft have become a reality . the additional acceleration such space craft experience changes their orbital dynamics and permits novel trajectories and concepts . in this work",
    "we investigate how the halo family of periodic orbits near the @xmath0 lagrangian point of the classical circular restricted three - body problem ( crtbp ) changes when radiation pressure is introduced .",
    "the crtbp has long been shown to be useful for the development of space craft missions .",
    "periodic orbits near @xmath0 , particularly the halo family , have been used in missions such as isee-3 , soho and genesis @xcite . for a solar sail the @xmath0 equilibrium point",
    "can be moved closer to the sun , providing advantages for solar observation .",
    "the geostorm mission is one such proposed solar sail mission aimed at providing early warnings of solar storms @xcite .",
    "understanding how the dynamics around the @xmath0 point change for a solar sail allows the design of such missions to target specific characteristics , such finding as orbits with particular periods , closest approaches to the sun or certain distances from the earth .",
    "the study of the periodic orbits is the first step in gaining an extensive overview of the solar sail dynamics around the displaced lagrangian point .",
    "the efficiency of a solar sail can be parameterized through the lightness number @xmath1 , which is the ratio of the solar radiation pressure acceleration to the solar gravitational acceleration . in a recent review of solar sail technology ,",
    "@xcite discuss examples of near - term , mid - term and far - time solar sail missions .",
    "these are respectively : geosail , a mission to place a solar sail in the earth s magnetotail ; the solar polar orbiter , a mission to place a solar sail in a polar orbit around the sun ; and the interstellar heliopause probe , a mission to measure the interstellar medium . from the characteristic accelerations provided , and assuming a sail efficiency of 85% the lightness numbers of these missions can be calculated ( following @xcite ) as @xmath4 for geostorm , @xmath5 for the solar polar orbiter and @xmath6 for the interstellar heliopause probe .",
    "for contrast , using values for the sail area and total mass given in @xcite , ikaros has @xmath7 while the upcoming sunjammer mission has @xmath1 in the range 0.0388 to 0.0455 @xcite .",
    "low values of the lightness number are thus of most interest to near - term applications .",
    "note that in these calculations we have used a realistic value of 85% efficiency for the sail material to convert the given physical parameters of the craft to a value of @xmath1 that can be compared to the theoretical model of a perfect sail which we will use in this paper .",
    "the theoretical model assumes the sail is ideal i.e. the acceleration is completely directed in the radial direction and sunlight is ` perfectly ' reflected .",
    "the search for periodic orbits in the classical crtbp is a large and active area of research . as the crtbp is hamiltonian with one first integral",
    "( the energy ) periodic orbits generically come in one - parameter families characterised by the energy level for any given mass ratio .",
    "this is a well known property of hamiltonian systems and of the crtbp in particular , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the simplest model of a solar sail in the earth - sun system is an extension of the crtbp that includes radiation pressure directed in a radial direction ( i.e. along the sun - line ) .",
    "this problem is also hamiltonian and as such it can be treated similarly to the crtbp .",
    "we will call this modified problem the radial solar sail crtbp , or rscrtbp .",
    "this problem was first studied in the astronomical context of binary star systems , where it is referred to as the photo - gravitational problem , for example in studies of the modified lagrangian points by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this early work showed that the lagrangian points still exist in the solar sail problem , as well as one - parameter families of periodic orbits similar to the classical crtbp .",
    "recently , the same model has been used to investigate periodic orbits for solar sails by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite approximates individual halo orbits using a third - order analytical expansion at the @xmath0 point in the rscrtbp , looking at values of the sail lightness number @xmath1 up to about @xmath8 .",
    "the authors find that the amplitude of these halo orbits increases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "@xcite looks at how the @xmath0 and @xmath9 halo families in the earth - sun case change for seven values of @xmath1 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , using differential correction starting from an approximate analytical solution .",
    "the @xmath0 halo family is seen to change in shape dramatically , while the @xmath9 family merely decreases in amplitude .",
    "partial linear stability information is also determined , and the @xmath0 halo family is seen to have a large region of linear stability at the higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite use multiple shooting methods to look at families of periodic orbits near to @xmath0 and @xmath9 for @xmath12 ( a lightness number proposed for the geostorm solar sail mission ) , and find that the associated planar and vertical lyapunov families and the halo families still exist near the @xmath0 point in this regime .",
    "while the rscrtbp is a simple extension for solar sails that are perpendicular to the sun - line it is not the only extension . in general the sail orientation relative to the sun - line",
    "can be described by two angles , and the problem is no longer hamiltonian .",
    "however families of periodic orbits can be generated using either of the two angles as a parameter . if the model of the sail alignment results in a reversible system then natural families will also exist for a given angle as for the hamiltonian case @xcite .",
    "@xcite look at the more general reversible system where the sail is parameterized by an angle @xmath13 to the sun - line ( more specifically , one of the two angles is held constant so that the sail is perpendicular to the sun - line at @xmath14 but rotates in the plane defined by the @xmath15 direction and the solar radial vector as @xmath13 changes ) , which reduces to the rscrtbp when @xmath14 . when @xmath16 the spatial @xmath17 symmetry of the problem is destroyed and the pitchfork bifurcation of the halo family from the planar lyapunov family disappears .",
    "the planar lyapunov family instead leaves the plane , splits and merges with the two branches of the halo family .    in the non - hamiltonian versions of the solar sail problem some sail angles make orbits possible that are always out of plane",
    "this has potential practical advantages , for example , one can generate ` pole sitter ' orbits sit over one of the earth s poles for their entire orbit ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is also the possibility of extending the problem to the eccentric restricted three - body problem e.g @xcite .    in this work",
    "we perform a comprehensive and detailed investigation of how the entire @xmath0  halo family , and certain connected families , change with the lightness number @xmath1 in the rscrtbp . to achieve this we use the boundary - value problem numerical continuation methods implemented in the auto software package @xcite .",
    "auto is a powerful tool for studying families of periodic orbits , as demonstrated by @xcite in an extensive study of certain families of periodic orbits in the classical crtbp . here , we look at the linear stability and bifurcations of the halo family in the rscrtbp over a large range of the lightness parameter , in most cases @xmath18 , extending the results of @xcite and investigating further the drastic change in shape of the halo family . in addition , we fully map out the linear stability of the family across a continuous range of @xmath1 . although some values of @xmath1 considered are not currently realistically obtainable they fit within the far - term mission examples discussed by @xcite and",
    "are included to gain a complete overview of the halo family in the rscrtbp and enable the design of new solar sail missions .",
    "the main results of our paper are summarized at the beginning of section [ sec : results ] .",
    "in particular , fig . [",
    "fig : stabdiag ] presents a complete qualitative bifurcation diagram of the rscrtbp halo family in the two - parameter plane .",
    "the remainder of section [ sec : results ] goes into the details of shape changes for the orbit families shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stabdiag ] .",
    "linear stability results are presented in section [ sec : stability ] .    prior to presenting our results",
    "we introduce the necessary background information on model and methods : section [ sec : model ] describes the rscrtbp geometry and mathematical model , section [ sec : numcont ] describes the numerical continuation schemes .",
    "section [ sec : periodicorbits ] describes the @xmath0  halo family and its context in the classical sun - earth crtbp , which serves as the starting point of our analysis .",
    "the classical circular restricted three - body problem ( crtbp ) considers the motion of a massless test particle under the influence of two point masses @xmath19 and @xmath20 in a circular orbit .",
    "it is often used to model the motion of a small body in planetary systems , for example either an asteroid in the sun - jupiter system or a space craft in the earth - moon system .",
    "a rotating reference frame with origin at the system center of mass is defined so that @xmath19 and @xmath20 remain fixed at @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , where @xmath23 is the mass ratio .",
    "units are used such that the distance between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , their angular velocity and @xmath24 are all unity , where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant . in this frame of reference",
    "the position of the test particle is @xmath26 and @xmath27 are its positions relative to the primary and secondary mass respectively .    to model the dynamics of a solar sail in the framework of the crtbp the effects of radiation pressure on the test particle need to be included in the equations of motion .",
    "@xcite models this additional acceleration on a perfectly reflecting solar sail as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the sun s mass , @xmath30 is the vector between the sail and sun and @xmath31 . in the context of the crtbp the sun",
    "is assumed to be the primary mass and we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is the lightness number , defined as the ratio of the solar radiation pressure acceleration to solar gravitational acceleration .",
    "the classical case with no radiation pressure is obtained when @xmath34 , and a value of @xmath35 would have radiation pressure equal to the gravitational force due to the sun . as discussed typical values of @xmath1 for solar sails",
    "are fairly low , generally below 0.1 .",

    "this new system differs from the crtbp only by the modification to the @xmath19 gravitational potential term and is still hamiltonian .",
    "the energy constant of the system is @xmath46 and a modified jacobi constant can be defined as @xmath47 . when @xmath34 the classical jacobi constant @xmath48 is recovered .",
    "for @xmath49 the five lagrangian points persist , although their location is slightly modified depending on the value of the lightness parameter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lpointssail ] . all the equilibria remain in the @xmath50 plane , and the collinear points remain on the @xmath37-axis . as @xmath1 tends to 1",
    "the triangular points and @xmath0 and @xmath51 coalesce at the position of @xmath19 , while @xmath9 moves inwards towards @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of the collinear points @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath51 remains of type center - center - saddle as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the linear stability of the triangular points is also similar to the classical case , being center - center - center and ( in general ) linearly stable below a modified routh ratio @xmath52 and ( an unstable ) center - focus - focus above it i.e. with eigenvalues of the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the modification is small , for example at @xmath55 the critical mass ratio is approximately @xmath56 compared to @xmath57 in the classical case .    the change in position of the lagrangian points in the rscrtbp for the sun - earth mass ratio of @xmath58 for @xmath1 increasing from 0 to 1 .",

    "a close - up of the near - earth region is shown in the right - hand panel .",
    "the classical location of each equilibrium is labeled , and the locus in @xmath1 shown for each point , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    as the rscrtbp is still hamiltonian with one first integral @xmath59 there are still one - parameter natural families of periodic orbits emanating from the lagrangian points as in the classical case . as discussed ,",
    "these orbits have been studied in the literature , both in the context of solar sails and astronomical models of radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion of the rscrtbp , like the crtbp , are invariant under the two transformations @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "thus periodic orbits can be symmetric with respect to the @xmath37-@xmath15 plane ( with time reversal ) , the @xmath37-@xmath62 plane , or both @xcite .",
    "halo orbits in particular are symmetric with respect to the @xmath37-@xmath15 plane .",
    "there are three main methods for generating periodic orbits : single shooting ( often referred to as differential correction in celestial mechanics ) , multiple shooting and collocation .",
    "single shooting methods generate a periodic orbit by correcting the initial state until a fixed point of the return map is found .",
    "multiple shooting methods are similar , but split the orbit up into segments . collocation methods on the other hand discretize the periodic orbit as piecewise polynomials .",
    "each of these discretization methods reduces the problem of finding a periodic orbit to numerically solving a finite - dimensional non - linear system of equations .",
    "continuation of orbit families in system parameters can then be wrapped around any of these methods . in general , shooting methods are simple to implement .",
    "collocation methods are computationally more expensive but more robust when computing periodic orbits with rapidly varying properties ( such as stability or shape ) along the trajectory ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as such they are well suited to dealing with orbits in the crtbp that have close approaches with either of the primaries .",
    "historically , periodic orbits in the classical crtbp were generated using single shooting , often incorporating methods to exploit the symmetry of some orbits , for example the method of @xcite to generate halo orbits .",
    "early work on periodic orbits for solar sails also use such methods e.g. @xcite , whereas more recent work has also used multiple shooting e.g. @xcite .",
    "collocation methods have also become popular recently for both the classical crtbp and solar sail periodic orbits , e.g. @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of the methods commonly used to generate solar sail trajectories see @xcite .    outside of celestial mechanics",
    "the same methods are employed for numerous dynamical systems , with multiple shooting and collocation methods being commonly used .",
    "there are many standard software packages available .",
    "one of these is auto , which continues families of periodic orbits by formulating them as an extended boundary - value problem ( bvp ) , discretizing the bvp using polynomial collocation with adaptive meshes and using pseudo - arclength continuation @xcite .",
    "it is widely used and regarded as one of the most advanced continuation software packages available @xcite .",
    "a number of recent studies use auto to investigate periodic orbits in the classical crbtp .",
    "@xcite investigate connections between families emanating from the five lagrangian points in the crtbp for a wide range of mass ratios , and determine the ranges over which these connections exist by continuing the branch points themselves .",
    "@xcite use auto to calculate invariant manifolds of halo orbits , among others .",
    "the capability to not only generate and continue periodic orbits , but to automatically detect and continue branch points in a parameter such as the mass ratio makes auto a powerful tool for the analysis of dynamical systems such as the crtbp .",
    "the halo family in the classical earth - sun problem experiences a very close approach with the earth .",
    "several other families relevant to the investigation here also suffer from close approaches and collisions with both masses . to accurately generate periodic orbits near close approaches a method such as collocation as implemented in auto",
    "is required .",
    "although an alternative would be a regularization of the equations of motion to remove the singularities ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in practice this introduces more complications , especially in the three - dimensional case .",
    "since collocation methods are sufficient for our investigation of the rscrtbp , regularization methods are not implemented .",
    "note also that we use the term ` collision ' in the sense that the trajectory passes through the singularity at the location of either point mass .",
    "close approaches that in reality would pass beneath the surface of the earth ( or sun ) are not detected in this work .",
    "although such orbits individually are not of practical interest , the ability to continue past them allows other parts of the family that do not have collisions to be investigated , and permits new orbits to be found .",
    "our aim is to investigate the evolution of the halo family and connected families , as well as their bifurcations , for a wide range of @xmath1 values in the rscrtbp .",
    "to do so we need to continue not only a large number of families , but the bifurcations within them , accurately and efficiently . as such auto is an obvious and very suitable choice for the method to do so .",
    "the next subsections describe the method for continuing periodic orbits in the rscrtbp in auto in more detail .",
    "as discussed above , families of periodic orbits can be continued by formulating them as an extended boundary - value problem ( bvp ) , discretizing the bvp using polynomial collocation and using pseudo - arclength continuation , as implemented in the auto package @xcite .",
    "the bvp equations must be provided to auto directly , and details of the application of this method for periodic orbits in the crtbp are given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and will be summarized here .",
    "for the first order system given by @xmath63 where for the rscrtbp @xmath64 and the parameters @xmath65 are @xmath66 and @xmath1 , the general boundary - value problem defining a periodic orbit is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the ( unknown ) period of the periodic orbit and @xmath69 is a nearby reference orbit ( usually the solution previously found along the branch ) .",
    "equation   is the equation of motion , where time has been rescaled to fit the periodic orbit into the unit time interval @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "equation   sets the periodic boundary conditions ( in our case @xmath71-dimensional ) .",
    "equation   fixes the phase of the periodic orbit .",
    "if @xmath72 is a solution of and then so is @xmath73 for any shift @xmath74 .",
    "condition determines the shift such that the new solution @xmath75 has minimal distance from the reference orbit @xmath69 . to continue a family of periodic orbits one of the parameters ( one component of @xmath65 )",
    "is left free and the additional pseudo - arclength condition @xmath76 is included , where @xmath74 is the _ pseudo - arclength_. in @xmath77 is the previous periodic orbit in the family , @xmath78 is the approximate tangent to the branch in the previous point @xmath77 , and @xmath74 is the approximate ( desired ) distance of the new solution @xmath79 from the previous solution given by @xmath77 . in the crtbp",
    "the natural families of periodic orbits are parameterized by the energy level .",
    "however , the energy does not appear directly in the equations of motion as they are given in eq .",
    "[ eq : eom ] , so the continuation scheme described above can not be immediately implemented .",
    "an alternative to reformulating the system that is also well suited to numerical implementation is provided by @xcite , who introduce an artificial parameter @xmath80 into the equations of motion together with an ` unfolding term ' .",
    "@xcite show that for a hamiltonian system given by @xmath81 with a single first integral @xmath82 the system @xmath83 has a locally unique one - dimensional branch of periodic orbits with @xmath84 .",
    "these branches are parameterized by the value of the integral @xmath85 and can be continued in the unfolding parameter @xmath80 as there are no nearby periodic orbits for @xmath86 .",
    "this method has been used by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to follow one - parameter families of orbits in the crtbp , and is equally applicable to the rscrtbp .",
    "as already discussed , @xcite demonstrate how it can be used in auto to generate all elementary families associated with the lagrangian points for a wide range of mass ratios .",
    "@xcite also use it in auto to generate unstable manifolds of vertical and halo orbits in the crtbp .",
    "the first integral in the crtbp is the energy , and @xcite and @xcite use an unfolding term of the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is related to the jacobi constant by @xmath89 .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite exploit the fact that the unfolding term in does not have to be a multiple of the gradient of first integral , @xmath90 .",
    "it is sufficient to unfold with any term @xmath91 as long as @xmath92 along all periodic orbits of the family .",
    "this is guaranteed for much simpler terms such as @xmath93 .",
    "this artificial damping term @xmath94 is sufficient to ensure that the branch with @xmath95 is unique , and this is the unfolding term we will also use for the rscrtbp .",
    "thus , the extended equations of motion for the rscrtbp are @xmath96 and families can be continued in auto as described .",
    "the unfolding parameter @xmath80 will always be zero to numerical precision for all calculated orbits .",
    "for the crtbp and rscrtbp either an initial reference orbit can be used to start the continuation , or families can be started by branching off from the lagrangian points directly .",
    "the latter method is most commonly used ( e.g. @xcite ) and will be used here also .",
    "the linear stability of a periodic orbit is relevant to station - keeping strategies and the existence and computation of unstable and stable manifolds . for a periodic orbit in a hamiltonian system such as the rscrtbp linear stability",
    "is determined by the floquet multipliers , the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix ( equivalent to the state transition matrix evaluated around the orbit , or the eigenvalues of the the linearized poincar map ) .",
    "@xcite provide an excellent overview of the application of floquet theory to the crtbp , which is also applicable to the rscrbp .",
    "briefly , the monodromy matrix is a real and symplectic map so its eigenvalues are both reciprocal pairs and complex conjugate pairs .",
    "further one pair of floquet multipliers is equal to @xmath97 , corresponding to time shift and perturbations tangent to the family of periodic orbits .",
    "there are in general four different possibly configurations of the remaining two pairs of multipliers which correspond to the orders of instability as defined by @xcite .",
    "( as this is a hamiltonian system it can be either neutrally stable or unstable , so the term ` instability ' will be used to refer to the linear stability . ) these configurations are :    * order-0 instability ( neutral stability at the linear level ) : both pairs of multipliers are on the unit circle ; * order-1 instability : one pair is on the real axis and one pair is on the unit circle ; * order-2 instability ( real ) : both pairs are on the real axis , and * order-2 instability ( complex ) : both pairs are in the complex plane and off the unit circle .",
    "note that neutral stability at the linear level does not in general imply neutral lyapunov stability of the orbit in the full system .",
    "the floquet multipliers also provide information on the bifurcations that occur along a family , which are often associated with a change in the linear stability .",
    "changes in linear stability occur generically through collisions of a pair of multipliers at @xmath97 or @xmath98 or collisions of two pairs of multipliers on the unit circle or real axis .",
    "a collision of a pair of multipliers at @xmath97 is a tangent bifurcation : either a fold in the energy level occurs or a new family branches off , usually in a pitchfork ( or _ symmetry - breaking _ ) bifurcation in the rscrtbp .",
    "we refer to this latter case as a _ branch point_. we use the notation @xmath99 to refer to a branch point between family @xmath100 and family @xmath101 , where @xmath100 has the higher symmetry .",
    "a collision of a pair at @xmath98 is a period - doubling bifurcation . at this point",
    "another family branches off with twice the period of the original family .",
    "two pairs of multipliers colliding on the unit circle is a krein collision ( also known as a secondary hamiltonian hopf bifurcation , torus bifurcation or neimark - sacker bifurcation ) .",
    "two pairs of multipliers colliding on the real axis is an inverse krein collision ( or a modified secondary hamiltonian hopf bifurcation ) .",
    "inverse krein collisions are not really bifurcations because they do not change the instability order ( it remains @xmath102 ) , although they do change the nature of the floquet multipliers .",
    "the @xmath0 halo family is well - known to possess every bifurcation discussed above , as well as all types of linear stability ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate how the @xmath0  halo family and its linear stability changes compared to the classical case when radiation pressure is introduced i.e. when @xmath1 is increased . since linear stability regions in the classical case are bounded by various bifurcations the detection and continuation of these in the parameter @xmath1 can be used to map out the linear stability as radiation pressure is increased .",
    "the floquet multipliers are calculated by auto for each periodic orbit , and using the unfolding method described in section [ subsec : auto ] , branch points to other families can be detected and continued in @xmath1 .",
    "( a complete description of the implementation of branch point continuation in the case of the crtbp is given in @xcite ) .",
    "period - doubling bifurcations can be found by using twice the period in the continuation and detecting them as branch points .",
    "however , auto currently has no methods of detecting or continuing krein collisions and inverse krein collisions . in addition , using the system as given in equation [ eq : unfolding ] the folds can not be detected or continued either as the energy does not appear in the equations of motion directly .",
    "instead , we must develop a new formulation of the system that permits this . in the case of folds , we achieve this by including the energy level directly , as discussed in section [ subsec : folds ] below . to detect and continue krein collisions and inverse krein collisions we derive an extended system of equations that describes the collision of the floquet multipliers .",
    "this new methodology is presented in section [ subsec : krein ] .",
    "these two extensions to the boundary - value problem continuation methods provide a complete toolset to track changes of linear stability in any system parameter such as @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we present a new formulation of the bvp of the rscrtbp that allows folds in the energy level of this system to be detected in auto .",
    "to do this the one - parameter families must be continued in the energy directly , rather than the non - physical parameter @xmath80 detailed in section [ subsec : auto ] .",
    "this can be achieved by using an unfolding term of the form @xmath103 instead , so that the extended equations of motion are now @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the original system given in equation with @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the energy associated with the system given by equation .",
    "equation   implies that along trajectories @xmath72 of the quantity @xmath108 satisfies @xmath109 since this relation prevents sign changes of @xmath110 , @xmath111 can be periodic only if it is constant .",
    "thus , @xmath108 takes the constant value @xmath112 on every periodic orbit . consequently",
    ", the term @xmath113 will be zero along every periodic orbit of such that a periodic orbit of with energy level @xmath112 will be a periodic orbit of with system parameter @xmath112 . moreover , every periodic orbit of is also a periodic orbit of , and @xmath114 ( which is a system parameter in ) will be its energy level .",
    "then the energy @xmath112 of the original system can be used as the continuation parameter , which allows folds in @xmath112 to be detected and continued in auto similarly to branch points .      in this section",
    "we derive a new extended system of bvp equations that define a krein collision .",
    "this system can then be implemented in auto , or similar continuation schemes .",
    "to detect a krein collision in a system such as the rscrtbp a constraint is needed to define the occurrence of two pairs of multipliers colliding .",
    "such a constraint is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 where the non - trivial floquet multipliers are @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "thus a simple method of detecting such collisions is to look for zeros of the function @xmath118 along the family of periodic orbits . to continue a krein collision , the original boundary - value problem given in equations [ eq : bvp1 ] to [ eq : bvp3 ] for the system @xmath119",

    "the linear stability of the part of h1 that branches off from the c2 family does not appear to change with @xmath1 ; the period - doubling bifurcation and inverse krein collision are present for values of @xmath1 up until at least 0.5 . at @xmath195",
    "the collision with @xmath20 disappears such that this part of h1 merges with h1c .",
    "the linear stability of h1c then does not change up to at least @xmath196 , although the first period - doubling bifurcation does gradually approach the rs branch point .",
    "there are no bifurcations in the hr family and it is always entirely of order-0 .",
    "when it merges with h1b to form h1r the linear stability of both families persists , and h1r is of order-0 after the branch point to w5 until the end of the family in the collision with @xmath19 .    the linear stability regions and bifurcations in h1 , h1b , h1c and h1r are also shown colour - coded in the example families plotting in figs .",
    "[ fig : egorbits1 ] and [ fig : egorbits2 ] in the appendix .",
    "we have used the boundary - value problem numerical continuation methods in auto @xcite with the unfolding method of @xcite to investigate how the h1 halo family evolves in the earth - sun rscrtbp as the sail lightness number @xmath1 ( or radiation pressure ) increases .",
    "we confirm the results of @xcite that a significant change in the shape of the h1 family occurs at low values of @xmath1 .",
    "we also find that the change is linked to a bifurcation in the retrograde satellite family rs about the earth at @xmath197 which results in the appearance of two additional branch points that split the original halo family h1 into the two families h1b and h1c .",
    "one of these new branch points collides with an existing branch point in rs at @xmath198 , further changing the nature of the halo family by causing the h1b and hr families to merge , resulting in the appearance of the h1r family .",
    "we note that the range of @xmath1 values given by @xcite for the upcoming sunjammer mission places that sail within required range for the h1b family .",
    "the continuation of the rs and c2 families in @xmath1 shows that the two are a single family in the @xmath157 parameter plane .",
    "that these two families connect at @xmath35 is not surprising , and indeed similar connections between families occur in the classical crtbp for limiting values of the mass ratio such as @xmath199 and @xmath164 .",
    "the connection of h1 to hr at @xmath171 is perhaps less predictable , and indicates that the rscrtbp could also be used as a novel means of generating some classical families .",
    "for example , continuing h1 in @xmath1 to obtain either the h1r family or h1b family ( and thus the rs family ) provides a very quick method of generating the classical hr and rs families through continuation back to @xmath34 .",
    "a consequence of the additional branch points in the rs family between @xmath145 and @xmath146 is that a region of the retrograde satellite family near the earth is not of order-0 instability , and thus will possess stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "this is in contrast to the classical retrograde satellite family that has order-0 instability from its start to the branch point with the hr family at very large amplitude .",
    "the existence of such manifolds may lead to the possibility of low - energy transfers to retrograde orbits for a solar sail that are not obtainable with traditional spacecraft .",
    "the linear stability of the h1 , h1b and h1c families in the rscrtbp changes rapidly below @xmath192 , with several regions of order-0 instability appearing and disappearing in h1 .",
    "the families h1b and h1r have large regions of order-0 instability , while h1c has none above @xmath200 , and is in general very unstable . while it might be expected that as @xmath1 increases the system becomes similar to that of the crtbp with a higher mass ratio the results presented here",
    "show that the effects of radiation pressure are more subtle than that .",
    "the detailed results presented here for the @xmath0  halo family in the earth - sun rscrtbp demonstrate that even at realistically low values of @xmath1 the families of periodic orbits obtainable by solar sails show significant differences to the classical case .",
