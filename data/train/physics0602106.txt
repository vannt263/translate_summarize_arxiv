    "the interaction of electrons and atoms with laser radiation is intensively and successfully being studied for many years now . however , due to a rapid technological progress , the high - power laser systems available today can generate peak intensities up to 10@xmath2 w/@xmath3 in the range of near - optical infrared frequencies @xcite , and a further increase can be expected within the next few years @xcite .",
    "consequently , the ponderomotive energy of an @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) inside such a laser wave is of the order of 1 gev , which is far beyond the typical energetic range of atomic physics but rather reaches the energy scale characteristic for elementary particle physics . if electrons or an @xmath4 and @xmath5 collide at such high energies , then particle reactions like heavy lepton - pair creation or hadron production can occur .",
    "this indicates that there might be a way to merge laser physics with high - energy physics @xcite .",
    "similar efforts are being undertaken with respect to laser physics and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the high - energy process of photon - induced @xmath1 pair creation by a projectile particle colliding with an intense laser beam has already been investigated before , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite",
    ". an essential ingredient to these studies is the ultrarelativistic energy of the incoming particle . in its rest frame ,",
    "the doppler - shifted laser frequency and field strength are considerably enhanced . as a consequence",
    ", the projectile actually faces an x - ray beam of near - critical intensity .    instead ,",
    "in the present paper we study a situation where elementary particle reactions arise from the interaction of a strong laser field with a nonrelativistic atomic system . to this end",
    ", we suppose that a positronium ( ps ) atom is brought into an intense laser wave .",
    "we note that the lifetimes of ortho - ps ( @xmath6 sec ) and para - ps ( @xmath7 sec ) are much longer than the typical duration of a strong laser pulse . due to the equal masses of its constituents ,",
    "the dynamical response of the positronium to the electromagnetic forces exerted by the laser field is rather unique @xcite : the laser s linearly polarized electric field leads to an antiparallel oscillatory motion of the particles in the transverse direction , while the magnetic lorentz force causes an identical ponderomotive drift motion along the laser propagation direction .",
    "this leads to periodic @xmath1 ( re)collisions ( see , in particular , fig.1 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "if the energy of the relative @xmath1 motion is large enough , then in these _ coherent _ collisions @xcite particle reactions can occur .",
    "thus , we shall study high - energy processes induced by @xmath1 annihilation resulting from a laser - driven ps atom . considering the case of a circularly polarized laser field we will find as a main result , however , that the various partial waves that constitute the ps ground - state interfere destructively , which causes a heavy suppression of the coherent reaction rate .",
    "this quantum effect can be related to the classical trajectories of the colliding particles in the laser field .",
    "furthermore , when the characteristic size of these trajectories ( or the size of the spreading particle wave packets ) exceeds the interatomic distance , then collisions between particles originating from different ps atoms will come into play , which opens the incoherent channel of the process .",
    "surprisingly it turns out that , in a circularly polarized laser field , the incoherent channel is dominant as the interference in the coherent channel is destructive . in order to study the incoherent process",
    "we replace the ps atom by a nonrelativistic @xmath1 plasma . in this situation ,",
    "exclusively incoherent @xmath1 collisions occur .",
    "it should be stressed that in the described setup the @xmath1 collision energy is basically determined by the kinetic energy @xmath8 contained in the transversal motion of the particles , which is considerably smaller than the ponderomotive energy @xmath9 mentioned above .",
    "here , @xmath10 is the electron rest energy and @xmath11 denotes the so - called laser intensity parameter with the electron charge @xmath12 and the laser s vector potential @xmath13 . for the highest intensities attainable at present",
    "@xmath14 is of order 10@xmath15 . in this respect ,",
    "the underlying laser acceleration of the particles is considerably different from the usual laser acceleration techniques , since the latter try to extract the ponderomotive energy gain along the laser propagation direction .",
    "nevertheless , the energetic thresholds for muon or pion production might be within reach .",
    "we further notice , that the principal difficulties of laser acceleration implied by the lawson - woodward theorem ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) are completely absent here since the @xmath5 and @xmath4 collide _ inside _ the laser wave .    against this background , we consider the specific process @xmath16 which is one of the most fundamental in high - energy physics .",
    "its cross section sets the scale for all @xmath1 annihilation cross sections @xcite .",
    "for example , at high energies one has @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the total cross section for the production of any number of strongly interacting particles @xcite .",
    "the threshold energy for the reaction @xmath16 amounts to @xmath19 in the field - free case , where @xmath20 denotes the muon mass . according to the above",
    ", a naive estimate thus suggests that a laser intensity corresponding to @xmath21 is required to produce a muon pair in a laser - driven @xmath1 collision .",
    "this value is reached , e.g. , for a linearly polarized laser beam of @xmath22 w/@xmath3 intensity and 1 ev photon energy .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the process @xmath16 in a laser field has not been considered before .",
    "the most closely related article treats the laser - assisted bhabha scattering @xmath23 @xcite . in ref.@xcite the low - intensity case ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) is analysed in detail with the emphasis lying on the resonances that can occur in the scattering cross - section due to the interaction of the leptons with the background laser field .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "another similar process , that has found the interest of several authors , is the mller scattering @xmath25 in a laser field ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we develop a formalism that allows us to calculate the rate for the reaction @xmath26 in a strong laser field .",
    "our treatment will be based upon the volkov solutions to the dirac equation .",
    "afterwards we analyse in detail the reaction kinematics . here",
    "we show in particular that the minimal laser intensity parameter required is indeed given by @xmath27 [ cf .",
    "eq.([ximin ] ) ] .",
    "further , the kinematical analysis will help us to derive a compact formula that gives an approximation to the total reaction rate and displays its main dependences [ cf .",
    "eq.([tilderps2 ] ) ] . in sec.iii",
    "we present our ( numerical ) results on the total and differential production rates and compare them with the known cross section for the field - free process @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we briefly consider the related process of muon pair production by a superstrong laser wave interacting with a nonrelativistic @xmath1 plasma . in this situation",
    "the interference effect does not play a role .",
    "we finish with a conclusion .",
    "we calculate the rate for positronium decay into muons in a strong laser field , i.e. , the rate for the laser - driven process @xmath28 .",
    "we assume a photon energy of about @xmath29 and a laser intensity parameter of order @xmath30 or larger @xcite . for mathematical simplicity",
    ", the laser field is taken to be a monochromatic , plane wave of circular polarization with the classical four - potential @xcite @xmath31 as usual , @xmath32 is assumed to be adiabatically switched on and off in the remote past and the distant future , respectively . in eq.([a ] ) , @xmath33 is the wave four - vector and @xmath34 are constant four - vectors chosen as @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath13 denoting the amplitude of the vector - potential . from now on we use relativistic units ( @xmath37 ) , except where otherwise stated .",
    "we notice that in the circularly polarized laser field ( [ a ] ) the @xmath5 and @xmath4 are permanently colliding since , according to the classical equations of motion , they are co - rotating in the polarization plane .",
    "the ps atom is assumed to be initially at rest and in its ground state . in a usual field",
    "theoretic formalism @xcite , this bound initial state can be expressed as a superposition of products of free states @xmath38 for the electron and positron with definite momenta @xmath39 .",
    "the superposition is weighted by the probability amplitude @xmath40 for finding a particular value of @xmath41 .",
    "note that this amplitude is just the compton profile of the ps ground state ( i.e. , the fourier transform of its wave function ) and @xmath41 can be viewed as the relative momentum of the electron - positron two - body system ( i.e. , as the momentum of an effective particle of reduced mass @xmath42 ) . when submitted to the strong laser field ( @xmath43 ) the ps atom",
    "will instantaneously be ionized , and the dynamics of the ionized @xmath4 and @xmath5 will be governed by the laser field , which predominates over the influence of the coulomb interaction between the particles .",
    "therefore , in the spirit of the strong - field approximation theories @xcite , we may replace the free leptonic states @xmath38 by laser - dressed volkov states @xcite . within this framework",
    ", the amplitude for the laser - driven process @xmath28 can be written as @xmath44 with a normalization volume @xmath45 and @xmath46 being the amplitude for the process @xmath16 in a laser wave ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) . in eq.([see ] ) , @xmath47 denotes the finestructure constant , @xmath48 is the free photon propagator @xcite , and the laser - dressed states for the electron and positron are given by @xcite @xmath49 with @xmath50 in eq.([vol ] ) , @xmath51 are the initial free four - momenta of the electron and positron ( outside the laser field ) , @xmath52 denote the particle spin states , the @xmath53 are free dirac spinors @xcite , and @xmath54 are the effective four - momenta of the particles in the laser field @xcite .",
    "note that eq.([q ] ) implies @xmath55 and thus @xmath56 , where the label @xmath57 denotes the momentum component that is perpendicular to the laser propagation direction .",
    "the corresponding effective mass reads @xmath58 with the dimensionless laser intensity parameter @xmath59 like free states , the volkov states in eq.([vol ] ) are normalized to a @xmath60-function in @xmath51 space @xcite .",
    "analogous expressions hold for the volkov states @xmath61 , the free momenta @xmath62 , the spin states @xmath63 , the effective momenta @xmath64 , the effective mass @xmath65 , and the intensity parameter @xmath66 of the muons .",
    "note that the amplitude ( [ see ] ) fully accounts for the interaction of the leptons with the laser field , while their interaction with the qed vacuum is taken into account to lowest order .",
    "similar approaches have been used for the theoretical description of laser - assisted @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath67 @xcite scattering .    by the standard procedure of using the generating function of the bessel functions @xcite",
    ", one can perform the space - time integrations in eq.([see ] ) to get @xmath68 with the electronic spinor - matrix product @xmath69 and a corresponding expression @xmath70 for the muons .",
    "the coefficients in eq.([m ] ) are given by @xmath71 \\nonumber\\\\ b_n^- & = & { 1\\over 2{\\rm i } } \\left [ j_{n-1}(\\alpha){\\rm e}^{-{\\rm i}(n-1)\\varphi_0 } -          j_{n+1}(\\alpha){\\rm e}^{-{\\rm i}(n+1)\\varphi_0 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "as is expressed by the energy - momentum conserving @xmath60-function at the first vertex , the integer number @xmath76 in eq.([see1 ] ) counts the laser photons that are emitted ( if @xmath77 ) or absorbed ( if @xmath78 ) by the electron and positron .",
    "similarly , @xmath79 is the number of laser photons emitted ( if @xmath80 ) or absorbed ( if @xmath81 ) by the muons .",
    "denoting the total number of absorbed laser photons by @xmath82 and integrating over the virtual photon momentum yields @xmath83 in general , the denominator @xmath84 in eq.([see2 ] ) could become zero . by way of a renormalization procedure",
    ", such mathematical singularities can be transformed into physical resonances that appear in the production process @xcite .",
    "one can easily see , however , that in the present situation , due to the large value of the laser intensity parameter and the nonrelativistic electron and positron momenta @xmath51 , one is always far off resonance @xcite .",
    "namely , on the one hand we have @xmath85 which becomes zero for @xmath86 on the other hand , the bessel functions @xmath87 , that enter the production amplitude through the coefficients in eq.([coeff1 ] ) , practically vanish unless @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the argument approximately equals @xmath91 where we have dropped the particle labels @xmath92 .",
    "now , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "hence , @xmath95 which , according to eq.([nres ] ) , is orders of magnitude smaller than would be required for a resonance to occur .",
    "the above argument can be further exploited . from eq.([nmax ] ) we know that the main contribution to the production amplitude comes from photon numbers @xmath76 with @xmath96 . but for those numbers we have to a very good approximation @xmath97 which , thus , can be pulled out of the sum in eq.([see2 ] ) : @xmath98 the summation over @xmath76 can now be performed analytically by virtue of graf s addition theorem @xcite with the result @xmath99 here we have used the abbreviations @xmath100 and similarly @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for the muons . the coefficients in eq.([uvw ] ) read @xmath103\\nonumber \\\\ k_r^- & = & { { \\rm i}\\over 2}\\left [ j_{r-1}(\\delta ) \\epsilon^{r-1 }                - j_{r+1}(\\delta ) \\epsilon^{r+1 } \\right]\\nonumber \\\\ l_r^\\pm & = & { 1\\over 4}\\left [ 2j_r(\\delta)\\epsilon^r          \\pm j_{r-2}(\\delta ) \\epsilon^{r-2 }          \\pm j_{r+2}(\\delta ) \\epsilon^{r+2 } \\right]\\nonumber \\\\ m_r & = & { { \\rm i}\\over 4}\\left [ j_{r-2}(\\delta ) \\epsilon^{r-2 }                - j_{r+2}(\\delta ) \\epsilon^{r+2 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the muonic quantities that correspond to @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we will see later that @xmath109 since @xmath110 for the typical parameters .",
    "an insignificant overall phase factor of @xmath111 can be dropped in eq.([coeff2 ] ) .",
    "now we come back to the reaction @xmath28 . in order to obtain the corresponding amplitude we have , according to eq.([sps ] ) , to multiply eq.([see3 ] ) by the compton profile @xmath40 of the positronium ground state and integrate over the relative momentum @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that this integration is a very difficult task that can only be done in an approximate way :    first , within the momentum range given by @xmath40 the electronic spinor - matrix products in eq.([spinor - matrix - products ] ) are practically constant ( on the 1% level since @xmath112 ) and can therefore be pulled out of the integration .",
    "the same holds for the kinematic factors @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and the energy - momentum conserving @xmath60-function @xcite .",
    "hence , we are left with integrals of the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 $ ] such that @xmath117 . the highly oscillating factor @xmath118 leads to a very small value of @xmath119 .",
    "the oscillatory damping of the amplitude is due to a destructive interference of the various partial waves within the ps wave packet .",
    "classically , this interference effect can be related to the extended motion of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 in the polarization plane of the laser .",
    "therefore , the mean impact parameter of the @xmath1 collisions is much larger than the initial ps size and the resulting @xmath120 production amplitude is suppressed .",
    "the laborious evaluation of the integral ( [ int ] ) is performed in the appendix .",
    "the result is @xmath121 with the ps radius @xmath122 .",
    "the damping factor can also be written as @xmath123 .",
    "note that @xmath124 gives the average impact parameter of the @xmath1 collisions since , according to their classical trajectories , the particles co - rotate in the polarization plane on opposite sides of a circle of radius @xmath125 .",
    "however , the classical picture suggests that the process probability is proportional to @xmath126 . instead , this factor is contained in the process amplitude such that the probability scales as @xmath127 .",
    "this indicates that the damping factor is truely of quantum mechanical origin .",
    "the square of the amplitude reads @xmath128 where @xmath129 indicates the sum over @xmath76 in eq.([uvw ] ) averaged over the ps ground state , as described above , @xmath51 ( @xmath130 ) are to be understood as some typical values of the electron and positron ( effective ) momenta , and the factors of volume @xmath45 and time @xmath131 come , as usual , from the square of the @xmath60-function .",
    "note that the energy - momentum conserving @xmath60-function , in particular , implies @xmath132 . from eq.([ssq ] ) we get the total reaction rate by averaging over the initial spin states , summing over the final spin states , and integrating over the final momenta : @xmath133 in the next but one subsection we derive a compact analytical formula that gives an estimate for the muon production rate ( [ rps ] ) .",
    "but before , we analyse in some detail the reaction kinematics .      in the following we provide estimates for the minimal ( @xmath134 ) and the typical ( @xmath135 ) photon numbers that are net - absorbed during the production process . from the latter we also find the typical momenta of the created muons .",
    "a lower bound on @xmath136 can be derived from the equation @xmath137 that follows from the energy - momentum conservation condition expressed by the @xmath60 function in eq.([ssq ] ) .",
    "setting @xmath138 and @xmath139 , this can be rewritten as @xmath140 with the polar angle @xmath141 .",
    "demanding @xmath142 , we get @xmath143 hence , it is required that @xmath144 , i.e. , the laser - dressed collision energy has to exceed twice the laser - dressed muon mass . using @xmath145",
    ", we find @xmath146 this means that , e.g. , for @xmath147 ev at least @xmath148 photons have to be absorbed from the laser wave for muon production to take place from the initially low - energy @xmath1 pair .",
    "this number is independent of the laser intensity .    assuming a symmetric situation with @xmath149 , eq.([rmin ] ) implies that the minimal muon energy is approximately given by @xmath150 hence , the muons are typically produced with highly relativistic momenta such that their dispersion relation approximately reads @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , they are emitted roughly along the laser propagation direction ( note that @xmath152 since @xmath153 , @xmath154 so that @xmath155 ) .",
    "more precisely , by solving eq.([cos ] ) for @xmath156 we find that the polar emission angle satisfies the relation @xmath157^{1/2 }   \\approx \\left({1-\\frac{4m^2}{m^2_*}}\\right)^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for these reasons one can say that the muon kinematics is similar to that of the laser photons .",
    "this `` photon - like '' nature of the muons results from the fact that they are essentially produced by a huge number of laser photons whose total energy , according to eq.([emin ] ) , exceeds the initial nonrelativistic energy of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 by orders of magnitude .",
    "the typical number of absorbed laser photons can be estimated by exploiting the properties of the bessel function @xmath158 in eq.([barjr ] ) . to this end , let us again assume a symmetric situation , which allows us to drop the particle indices @xmath92 in what follows .",
    "the energy - conservation condition then can approximately be written as @xmath159 .",
    "because of the photon - like muon momenta this can be expressed as @xmath160 where @xmath161 . applying the momentum conservation condition @xmath162 , we thus get @xmath163 now , let @xmath164 and @xmath165 . then , again by the momentum - conservation condition , @xmath166 . hence , eq.([star ] ) implies @xmath167^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 was used .",
    "thus , the argument of the bessel functions in eq.([barjr ] ) approximately equals @xmath169 we note that , according to eq.([rmin ] ) , the expression under the square root on the right - hand side of eq.([beta ] ) is positive . by the properties of the bessel functions @xcite , the typical number of absorbed laser photons is expected to be determined by the condition @xmath170 .",
    "this yields @xmath171 with @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding typical muon momenta read @xmath173.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the eq.([q ] ) between the effective and the free four - momenta and the relations ( [ kp ] ) below , we find for the typical values of the muon momenta after the interaction with the laser field @xmath174 for example , for @xmath175 and @xmath147 ev we have @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 . from eqs.([barr ] ) and ( [ barp ] ) we see that the typical final energy of the muon pair satisfies the relation @xmath180 , which reflects the law of energy conservation after the laser has been switched off .",
    "equation([barr ] ) also implies that the minimal intensity parameter required for the process to have a significant probability ( i.e. , to be able to fulfill @xmath181 ) amounts to @xmath182 which agrees with our earlier naive estimate .",
    "we notice that the partial rate for muon production by the absorption of @xmath183 photons is zero .",
    "namely , according to eqs.([qperp ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) , for @xmath184 the transverse muon momentum and with it the argument of the bessel functions practically vanish . according to the above",
    ", the partial rate reaches a maximum at @xmath185 , which at @xmath186 is twice as large as the minimal number of photons : @xmath187 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the typical muon momenta in eq.([barp ] ) can be interpreted by employing a classical simple man s model of the creation process . in the classical picture",
    ", the threshold value of the laser intensity ( [ ximin ] ) corresponds to the situation when , in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath1 system , the kinetic energy is large enough to create muons at rest .",
    "i.e. , denoting the laser phase by @xmath188 , we have @xmath189 at the creation phase @xmath190 , where the prime indicates the center - of - mass frame . the classical equation of motion for a muon in a laser field with the initial condition ( [ p0 ] )",
    "has the solution @xmath191 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{p_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , after the interaction with the laser field the muon momenta equal @xmath192 due to the @xmath1 longitudinal drift motion in the laser field , the relative velocity between the center - of - mass frame and the lab frame amounts to @xmath193 [ see eq.([q ] ) ] .",
    "the lorentz transformation to the lab frame thus yields @xmath194 the latter coincides with the typical muon momenta at the threshold @xmath186 given by the quantum theory : @xmath195 and @xmath196 [ see eq.([barp ] ) ] .",
    "the typical number of absorbed photons is determined by the muon final energy : @xmath197 , which is in agreement with eq.([barr ] ) .",
    "our simple man s model can also explain a peculiarity in the angular distribution of the muons ( see fig . 4 in sec .",
    "iii.a ) . since @xmath198 , the muons move in a narrow cone with the axis parallel to the laser propagation direction , but at very small angles the angular spectrum has a dip .",
    "the dark region in the angular distribution occurs because the muons , although having been created with zero transverse momentum in the laser field , acquire a nonvanishing transverse momentum after switching off the laser field [ see eqs.([p0 ] ) and ( [ p_t ] ) ] .      equation ( [ rps ] ) for the total rate of the reaction @xmath199 , although looking rather innocent , is actually quite involved and can be evaluated only numerically .",
    "therefore it is desirable to find , by analytical means , an approximation to eq.([rps ] ) that displays its main physical content . to this end",
    ", we consider the contribution to the total rate stemming from the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([uvw ] ) . from our numerical calculations",
    "we learn that this term gives by far the main contribution ( @xmath200 ) .",

    "this leads to the desired typical value of @xmath223 which can be pulled out of the integration in eq.([tilderps1 ] ) .",

    "we notice that eq.([tilderps2 ] ) can also be represented in the form @xmath228 here @xmath229 stands for the process cross section , which for @xmath222 becomes @xmath230 recalling the simple man s model and using the electron energy in the center - of - mass frame @xmath231 , we can infer that eq.([rate_ps ] ) is based on the process cross section @xmath232 with @xmath233 being the electron gamma - factor in the center - of - mass frame .",

    "in this situation , electrons and positrons from different ps atoms can collide which gives a total number of @xmath236 incoherent collisions . in the next section",
    "we will present our results both on the coherent and the incoherent channel of muon production .",
    "based on eq.([rps ] ) , we have numerically calculated the coherent rate for @xmath120 pair creation from a single ps atom submitted to a strong laser field of circular polarization .",
    "the laser frequency has been taken to be @xmath147 ev , throughout .",
    "for the laser intensity parameter we have chosen the three different values @xmath175 , 500 , and 1000 . the corresponding laser intensities amount to @xmath237 w/@xmath3 , @xmath238 w/@xmath3 , and @xmath239 w/@xmath3 , respectively .    in fig.2 , the dependence of the total muon creation rate on the laser intensity parameter is shown . for the intensity parameters under consideration we find production rates of @xmath240 sec@xmath241 ( @xmath175 ) , @xmath242 sec@xmath241 ( @xmath243 ) , and @xmath244 sec@xmath241 ( @xmath245 ) . the analytical approximation ( [ tilderps2 ] )",
    "overestimates these numbers , but is still in rather good agreement with them ( cf .",
    "the reason for the overestimation , in particular for @xmath246 , are the rather large values of @xmath218 and @xmath219 used in eq.([t2 ] ) . a total production rate of 10@xmath247 sec@xmath241 means that in a finite laser pulse of femtosecond duration the probability to create a muon pair from a single ps atom is of order 10@xmath248 .",
    "we notice that a typical laser focal volume will contain only one ps atom on average since the highest positronium densities achievable at present are on the order of 10@xmath249 @xmath250 @xcite .",
    "however , proposals to reach a ps density of @xmath251 @xmath250 @xcite or even a ps bose - einstein condensate of @xmath252 @xmath250 @xcite are being considered .",
    "the above numbers of created muons seem too small to be experimentally accessible . clearly , the main reason for the smallness of the coherent reaction rate lies in the damping factor @xmath253 [ cf . eq.([barjr ] ) ] .",
    "the latter results from the destructive interference of the partial waves constituting the ps wave packet in the laser field , which makes the recollision of an @xmath5 and @xmath4 from the same ps atom highly unlikely . from a simplified , classical point of view , the reason for the damping lies in the large collisional impact parameter of order @xmath125 that is due to the equal handed rotations of the particles in the laser polarization plane @xcite .    in fig.3 ,",
    "the partial production rates with respect to the number @xmath136 of absorbed laser photons are shown ( i.e. , the contributions to the total rate stemming from a net absorption of @xmath136 laser photons in the production process ) .",
    "the photon number is given in units of @xmath254 , which amounts to @xmath255 ( @xmath175 ) , @xmath256 ( @xmath243 ) , and @xmath257 ( @xmath245 ) , respectively .",
    "the shape of the curves in fig.3 can be understood with the help of the kinematical analysis in sec.ii.b .",
    "first , according to eq.([rmin ] ) , the minimal number of laser photons required from kinematical constraints amounts to @xmath258 , independent of the laser intensity .",
    "if we express this number with respect to the respective values of @xmath259 , then we get @xmath260 ( @xmath175 ) , @xmath261 ( @xmath243 ) , and @xmath262 ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "the partial reaction rate for @xmath263 is always zero , as can be seen in fig.3 .",
    "further , in agreement with eq.([barr ] ) , the curves exhibit maxima at @xmath264 ; for @xmath265 the maximum is located at @xmath266 , while for @xmath243 and 1000 we have @xmath267 .",
    "this feature reflects the mathematical properties of the bessel functions and is correctly predicted by our simple man s model .",
    "figure 4 shows the angular distribution @xmath268 for one of the produced muons . for symmetry reasons , the spectra for the muon @xmath269 and the antimuon @xmath270 are identical .",
    "the differential rate is expressed with respect to the polar angle @xmath271 of the effective muon momentum .",
    "the value of the laser intensity parameter is chosen to be @xmath175 .",
    "one can see that the muon is emitted into a very narrow angular range starting from @xmath272 and extending to @xmath273 , which is in agreement with eq.([thetamax ] ) .",
    "in other words , as has already been mentioned before , the muon moves practically parallel to the propagation direction of the laser beam .",
    "the occurence of a minimal emission angle arises from the fact that , according to eq.([beta ] ) , the argument of the bessel function is proportional to the transverse momentum component @xmath274 , which itself is proportional to @xmath275 .",
    "thus , the emission angle can not be too small because otherwise the bessel function will vanish .",
    "since @xmath276 , a dark angular region also exists in the angular spectrum @xmath277 with respect to the muon momentum outside the laser beam .",
    "an alternative explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a simple man s model has been given at the end of sec.ii.b .      in this subsection",
    "we want to draw a comparison between the coherent muon creation from a laser - driven ps atom and the corresponding field - free process @xmath16 . in the high - energy limit",
    ", the cross section for this reaction reads @xcite @xmath278 where @xmath279 denotes the collision energy . in the case with laser field",
    ", the square root of the quantity @xmath280 can be regarded as some average collision energy .",
    "for the @xmath14-values considered in this paper , the laser - dressed collision energy is thus about 1 gev .",
    "hence , the reference cross section in eq.([field - free ] ) to compare with should be taken at @xmath281 gev , where its value is about 100 nbarn . to transform this cross section into a reaction rate",
    ", we have to multipy by the incident particle flux . in collider experiments , instead of the incoming flux , the luminosity is more commonly used .",
    "when a beam of @xmath282 positrons collides at high energy with a beam of @xmath283 electrons , then the luminosity is given by @xmath284 where @xmath285 is the circumference of the collider ring and @xmath286 is the beam cross sectional area at the collision point . to make the comparison with a single laser - driven ps atom",
    ", we use @xmath287 along with the typical values @xmath288 m and @xmath289 @xmath3 .",
    "note that the corresponding mean impact parameter @xmath290 of the field - free collision is of the same order of magnitude as the electron - positron spatial separation @xmath291 in the laser wave .",
    "the resulting luminosity @xmath292 @xmath293sec@xmath241 leads to a muon creation rate of 10@xmath294 sec@xmath241 .",
    "this number is considerably smaller than the production rates we found in sec.iii.a .",
    "however , in a real collider experiment one has bunches of @xmath295 particles leading to much higher luminosities and reaction rates , of course .",
    "we have seen in sec.iii.a that the large electron - positron wave - packet size during the motion in the laser field suppresses the coherent reaction rate dramatically . to reduce this size and achieve @xmath1 collisions at microscopic impact parameters",
    ", one can think of employing different , more complicated field configurations @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the muon creation from ps atoms will be dominated by the incoherent production channel introduced at the end of sec.ii.c .",
    "the latter coincides with the process of muon creation , when a low - energy @xmath1 plasma interacts with a strong laser beam . we have redone our calculation for this situation , i.e. , for a free , initially nonrelativistic @xmath5 and @xmath4 that collide in a strong laser field and create a @xmath120 pair by annihilation .",
    "our results on the partial production rates for reasonable experimental parameters ( see below ) are shown in fig.5 .",
    "the shape of the curves is similar to those in fig.3 .    from eqs.([tilderps2 ] ) and ( [ barjr ] ) one can infer that the total rate for muon creation from laser - plasma interaction approximately reads @xmath296 where @xmath297 denotes the number of electrons and positrons in the interaction volume @xmath298 , which is given by the laser focal volume . from eq.([rate_plasma ] ) we can estimate the total number of produced muons @xmath299 during the interaction with @xmath300 laser shots , each single shot having a pulse duration of @xmath301 . when plugging in some reasonable numbers : @xmath302 fs , @xmath303 @xmath304 , and assuming that the presently achievable number of positrons @xmath305 @xcite can be compressed into the interaction volume or , alternatively , is created via a newly emerging laser - based technique @xcite , then we get @xmath306 muon production event during @xmath307 shots .",
    "this number , being based on rather optimistic experimental parameters ( especially concerning the positron compression ) , indicates that the realisation of the incoherent muon creation process might be not inhibitory difficult , but still it will be very hard with modern experimental techniques .",
    "in this paper we have studied @xmath120 production by @xmath1 annihilation from a laser - driven ps atom . to this end , a calculational framework has been developed where the initial bound state is described as a superposition of volkov states weighted by the compton profile of the ps ground state . by virtue of the interaction with the qed vacuum , which is treated in the first order of perturbation theory",
    ", this initial state can decay into a laser - dressed @xmath120 pair .",
    "also , the related process of muon creation by the interaction of a strong laser field with a low - energy @xmath1 plasma has been examined .",
    "we have found that the minimal laser intensity required for the process to occur corresponds to an intensity parameter of @xmath21 . in the case of a near - optical laser wave of circular polarization ,",
    "e.g. , this value is reached for an intensity of @xmath308 w/@xmath3 .",
    "this means that , starting from a nonrelativistic ps atom or @xmath1 plasma , fundamental particle reactions can be ignited by a superstrong laser field of an intensity that is just one order of magnitude larger than the highest values available today .",
    "however , in the ps case , the total production rate resulting from the coherent recollisions is extremely small and amounts to about 10@xmath247 per second only .",
    "the strong suppression is caused by a destructive interference of the different partial waves constituting the bound initial state in the superintense laser field .",
    "this phenomenon is also expressed by a compact formula for the total rate that we derived by analytical means . as a consequence , in the considered setup",
    "the production rate will be dominated by the muon creation via incoherent @xmath1 scattering , for which the system of ps atoms has no advantage compared to an @xmath1 plasma . for the incoherent collisions , the interference plays no role and",
    "the resulting muon creation rate is significantly larger than the corresponding rate from the coherent production channel .",
    "nevertheless , very demanding experimental conditions are required in order to achieve observable muon yields .",
    "finally , we note that similar reaction rates can be expected for laser - driven @xmath309 production from @xmath1 or @xmath120 . a more promising alternative within circularly polarized field configurations",
    "might be the process @xmath310 , the field - free cross section of which being several orders of magnitude larger than the one for @xmath120 creation in eq.([field - free ] ) @xcite .      in this appendix we calculate the integral in eq.([int ] ) .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates it reads @xmath311 with @xmath312^{1/2},\\\\   \\alpha & = & { 2m\\xi\\over\\omega}{p_0p_\\perp\\over p_\\perp^2+m^2}\\ , , \\\\",

    "we can expand the functions @xmath60 and",
    "@xmath321 : @xmath322 note here that , since @xmath323 [ see eq.([nmax ] ) ] , we may drop terms of this order in the expansion of @xmath60 . further , since the bessel function @xmath324 is exponentially or oscillatorily damped unless @xmath325 , the main contribution to the integral comes from the region with @xmath326 . accordingly , terms of order @xmath327 may be neglected in the phase @xmath328 .",
