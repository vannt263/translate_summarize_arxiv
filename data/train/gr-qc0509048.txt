    "in the study of black hole evaporation , there has been an important issue how black hole mass decreases as a back reaction of the hawking radiation@xcite .",
    "we have to confront with this issue to resolve the information loss paradox .",
    "there have been many works concerning black hole evaporation , either in string theories@xcite@xcite@xcite , or semiclassical theory typically using apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "hiscok studied spherical model of the black hole evaporation using the vaidya metric , which we also use in present work , to solve the black hole evaporation problem .",
    "however , he simply set a model not taking account of the field equation .",
    "work@xcite treated the black hole mass more generally than our present case .",
    "however , he did not use the field equation either .",
    "one of the more recent studies is sorkin and piran s work @xcite on charged black holes . and neutral case has been done by hamade and stewart@xcite .",
    "their conclusion is that black hole mass decreases or increases depending on initial condition .",
    "they used a model of the double null coordinates , and obtained a numerical result .",
    "but they did not consider the hawking effect directly but they used massless scalar field as a matter .",
    "brevik and halnes calculated primordial black hole evaporation@xcite .",
    "very recently hayward studied black hole evaporation and formation using the vaidya metric @xcite .",
    "it seems no analytical equation has been proposed for the black hole mass with the hawking effect taken into account .",
    "+  the dynamics for the black hole mass with the hawking effect is a long standing problem .",
    "page@xcite derived the equation of mass intuitively , that is @xmath0 .",
    "but it does not come from the first principle .",
    "we will comment on his intuitive result in the final section . to derive the equation of mass from the first principle we should treat the einstein equation with the back reaction term by the hawking radiation .",
    "however , the einstein equation can not be analytically solved , because the equation contains fourth derivative terms as back reaction .",
    "recently ashtekar and krishnan derived an equation which describes how the horizon changes in time .",
    "it needs only information of the horizon surface .",
    "+   in section [ sec2 ] , dynamical horizon is reviewed . in section [ sec3 ] , the location of the dynamical horizon in the vaidya spacetime is identified . and",
    "then in section [ sec4 ] , the dynamical horizon equation is written down in the case of vaidya matter with the hawking effect being taken into account .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is devoted to conclusion and discussions .",
    "ashtekar and krishnan considered dynamical horizon @xcite@xcite , and derived a new equation that dictates how the dynamical horizon radius changes .",
    "apparent horizon is a time slice of the dynamical horizon .",
    "the definition of dynamical horizon is , +   + _ definition_. a smooth , three - dimensional , spacelike submanifold @xmath1 in a space - time is said to be a _ dynamical horizon _ if it is foliated by preferred family of 2-spheres such that , on each leaf s , the expansion @xmath2 of a null normal @xmath3 vanishes and the expansion @xmath4 of the other null normal @xmath5 is strictly negative .",
    "+   +  the requirement that one of the null expansions is zero comes from the intuition that black hole does not emit even light . and",
    "the requirement that other null expansion is strictly negative comes from that null matter goes in black holes inwards .",
    "+  in this definition , we can recapitulate the important formula which gives a change of the dynamical horizon radius by the matter flow , using 3 + 1 and then 2 + 1 decompositions and also the gauss - bonet theorem .",
    "@xmath6 here @xmath7 the radius of the dynamical horizon , @xmath8 is the stress - energy tensor , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the shear , and @xmath11 , with two dimensional metric @xmath12 , and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the radius of the dynamical horizon .",
    "+  this is the dynamical horizon equation that tells how the horizon radius changes by the matter flow , shear and expansion . in the spherically symmetric case that we shall consider in what follows the second term of the right hand side vanishes .",
    "although in the case of quantum field theory in curved space time , the dominant energy condition does not hold@xcite@xcite , we can use the dynamical horizon equation because it is valid even when the black hole radius decreases . and",
    "the dynamical horizon equation is a consequence of the einstein equation .",
    "we use the dynamical horizon equation in place of the einstein equation . +  because of the negative energy",
    ", we can expand the definition of the dynamical horizon in the case of timelike .",
    "then the definition of the dynamical horizon is now , +   + _ definition ( modified version)_. a smooth , three - dimensional , spacelike or * timelike * submanifold @xmath1 in a space - time is said to be a _ dynamical horizon _ if it is foliated by preferred family of 2-spheres such that , on each leaf s , the expansion @xmath2 of a null normal @xmath3 vanishes and the expansion @xmath4 of the other null normal @xmath5 is strictly negative . +   + we can easily calculate the timelike dynamical horizon equation only replacing @xmath15 and @xmath16 . and",
    "the way of 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 decomposition is replaced .",
    "the timelike dynamical horizon was defined by ashtekar and galloway and called _ timelike membrane _ @xcite .",
    "the vaidya metric is of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are functions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is null vector and @xmath21 is the area radius , and @xmath23 is the mass defined by @xmath24 , a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this metric is spherically symmetric . by substituting the vaidya metric ( 2 ) into the einstein equation so that we can identify the energy - momentum tensor @xmath8 as @xmath25 we do not need to check that the solution of the dynamical horizon equation satisfies the einstein equation . because we would like to consider the schwarzschild like metric , we set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is tortoise coordinate with dynamics @xmath28 for later convenience",
    ", we write , @xmath29 there are two null vectors , @xmath30 corresponding to the null vector @xmath22 , and the other is @xmath31 here we multiply @xmath32 so that @xmath33 .",
    "this choice of the null vector @xmath3 is explained in figure [ fig5 ] .    0.1 in    ( 17.7000 , 12.1000 ) ( 7.9000,-18.5000 )    ( 11.6000,-13.9000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath3(7.9000,-13.8000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath15(9.7000,-19.3000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath34(11.4000,-16.7000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath5    from now on we put , @xmath35 in a similar form to the schwarzschild metric , assuming that @xmath36 is a function of @xmath20 only .",
    "for a constant @xmath23 , the metric coincides with the schwarzschild metric .",
    "we calculate the expansions @xmath2 and @xmath37 of the two null vectors @xmath38 , because the definition of the dynamical horizon requires one of the null expansions to be zero and the other to be minus .",
    "the result is , @xmath39 from @xmath40 we get , @xmath41 we can check that the other null expansion @xmath42is strictly negative . therefore in this case , we can apply the dynamical horizon equation . in the usual schwarzschild metric with dynamics ,",
    "both expansions become zero .",
    "this is the one of the reasons why we choose the vaidya metric . by inserting equation ( 7 ) to equation ( 14 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath43 note that @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "now we solve @xmath40 , to determine the dynamical horizon radius as @xmath45 from this equation we obtain , @xmath46 here @xmath47 is also the solution of the dynamical horizon .",
    "the dynamical horizon radius @xmath48 is given by solving ( 17 ) as @xmath49 note that this dynamical horizon radius is outside the @xmath50 , that is othor solution .",
    "at first , we should derive the energy - momentum tensor @xmath51 for the integration of the dynamical horizon equation .",
    "for this end we derive it from the given vaidya matter . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor becomes @xmath53 here we have made the coordinate transformation from @xmath21 to @xmath27 .",
    "writing @xmath54 in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 given by ( [ f45])([f46 ] ) with @xmath33 , we see @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the unit vector in the direction of @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath60 for the dynamical horizon integration ( [ fdyna ] ) , we get @xmath61 where we have used @xmath62 and the fact @xmath63 changing the integration variable from @xmath48 to @xmath23 . in the above calculation , we treat @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath48 fixed , because these functions are used only in the integration . inserting equation ( [ f52 ] ) to the dynamical horizon equation ( [ fdyna ] ) , we obtain @xmath66 taking the limit @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68 this equation is the dynamical horizon equation in the case that only the vaidya matter is present .",
    "there is no solution of this equation , except the trivial one ( @xmath47 or @xmath50 ) , so @xmath69 here @xmath36 is the arbitrary function only of the @xmath20 , which represent the vaidya black hole spacetime .",
    "+  next , we take into account the hawking radiation . to solve this problem ,",
    "we use two ideas that is to use the dynamical horizon equation , and to use the vaidya metric .",
    "the reason to use the dynamical horizon equation comes from the fact that we need only information of matter near horizon , without solving the full einstein equation with back reaction being the fourth order differential equations , for a massless scalar field . for the matter on the dynamical horizon , we use the result of candelas @xcite , which assumes that spacetime is almost static and",
    "is valid near the horizon , @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 where we have used a well known result , @xmath72 and where @xmath73 .",
    "this matter energy is negative near the event horizon . in the dynamical horizon equation ,",
    "if black hole absorbs negative energy , black hole radius decreases .",
    "this is one of the motivations to use the negative energy tensor .",
    "next we replace length of @xmath74 to unit length , because in the dynamical horizon equation @xmath75 is used , so @xmath76 and therefore , the energy tensor becomes @xmath77 calculating the integration on the right hand side of ( [ fdyna ] ) for this matter , @xmath78 here we insert the expression for @xmath48 ( [ f43])in the first line , and the expression for @xmath79 is used . here",
    "@xmath80 is a constant calculated in @xcite @xmath81 if we also take account of the contribution of the vaidya matter , and inserting this into the integration to the dynamical horizon equation ( [ fdyna ] ) , we obtain @xmath82 taking the limit @xmath67 , we finally get @xmath83 or @xmath84 this is the main result of the present work that describes how the mass of black hole decreases .",
    "this equation is the transcendental equation , so usually it can not be solved analytically .",
    "however , with the right hand side depending only on @xmath85 , we can easily treat eq.([f4 ] ) numerically .",
    "figure [ plot ] is a graph of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath20 +  if the dynamical horizon were inside the event horizon , the dynamical horizon radius would be @xmath86 in this case , the dynamical horizon equation would become @xmath87 the singular behavior of this expression excludes its physical relevance .",
    "+  now we show an approximation of the eq.([f4 ] ) in particular limiting case . taking the limit @xmath88 , and @xmath89",
    ", we can see that ( [ f4 ] ) becomes , @xmath90 where @xmath91 are positive constants . or @xmath92 so , in the vanishing process the mass is proportional to @xmath20 . for @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a positive constant .",
    "it comes from the limit @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in this limit",
    "the equation ( [ f4 ] ) becomes @xmath98 .",
    "this is different from page s result @xcite . because if @xmath23 goes to large , the dynamical horizon radius increases as @xmath99 , so absorbed energy also become large .",
    "from this reason derivative of @xmath23 by @xmath20 changes .",
    "if we do not consider next order , the derivative of @xmath23 becomes @xmath100 , so that @xmath101 , contradicting with page s intuition .",
    "+     as a function of v from the equation ( 60),width=188 ]",
    "we have derived an equation which describes how the black hole mass changes taking into account of the hawking radiation , in the special vaidya spacetime which becomes the schwarzschild spacetime in the static case . from the analysis of the transcendental equation ( 38 )",
    ", we have shown that the black hole mass eventually vanishes and the spacetime becomes the minkowski spacetime independent of the initial black hole mass size .",
    "+  the dynamical horizon method in this paper can take into account of the back reaction of the hawking radiation without solving the field equation which contains the fourth order differentials .",
    "+   in the limit of the black hole mass going to zero , the derivative of the mass becomes small in proportion to the null coordinate ( @xmath26 ) . on the other hand as",
    "the black hole mass becomes large , the derivative behaves the minus of the inverse of the logarithm of the mass . our result , which is different from page s result , comes from the fact that in the large mass limit , the black hole radius behaves like quadratic of the black hole mass .",
    "this probably comes from when large mass limit that the approximation @xmath102 is broken .",
    "+  we would like to compare the present work to the preceding works . sorkin and piran or hamade and stewart used a massless scalar field instead of the hawking radiation as the back reaction directly .",
    "the conclusion of their paper is that black hole starts with the small mass and it evaporates or increases .",
    "however , it is shown in the present work that even if the black hole starts with a large mass it always vanishes .",
    "+  although we have treated the black hole evaporation semi - classically , we hope this work will give an intuition to quantization of black holes",
