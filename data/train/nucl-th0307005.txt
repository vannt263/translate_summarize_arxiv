    "the @xmath0 resonance has kept the attention of researchers for a long time .",
    "it has been suggested to be a quasi - bound @xmath3 state which appears in a coupled channel approach to the strangeness @xmath4 meson - baryon interaction close to the @xmath3 threshold  @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies combining chiral dynamics and unitarity in coupled channels  @xcite , have brought new light into this idea and substantiated it from the modern perspective of chiral lagrangians . yet , one of the theoretical surprises along these lines has been the persistent finding of two resonances close to the nominal @xmath0 .",
    "it was already found in ref .",
    "@xcite using the cloudy bag model that two poles , rather than one , appeared in the region around 1405 mev with the quantum numbers of @xmath0 , @xmath5 .",
    "subsequently , two similar poles have been found in refs .",
    "@xcite using chiral unitary approaches to the problem .",
    "all the different approaches agree qualitatively in the following :    * two poles appear in the complex plane close to the 1405 mev region . *",
    "the pole at lower energies has a larger width than the one appearing at higher energies . * the lower energy resonance couples strongly to @xmath2 and weakly to @xmath3 ,",
    "while the opposite occurs for the resonance appearing at higher energy , although in models which do not fit the @xmath6 threshold branching ratio  @xcite , the couplings look more similar .    a clarification of this interesting result has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite where the two @xmath0 states have been interpreted in the following way : the su(3 ) decomposition of the octet representation of the @xmath7 baryons times the octet of the @xmath8 pseudoscalar mesons leads to a singlet and two octets ( apart from the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 representations ) . the two octets appear degenerate in the limit of exact su(3 ) symmetry , but the explicit breaking of su(3 ) due to different masses of the mesons and the baryons breaks the degeneracy .",
    "when this happens , one observes two trajectories for the poles in terms of a given su(3 ) breaking parameter .",
    "two branches for @xmath12 and two for @xmath13 emerge , one of them moving to the higher energy side of the su(3 ) symmetric pole and the other one moving to the lower energy side .",
    "the @xmath13 branch that moves to low energies comes very close to the singlet pole , in such a way that reactions occurring in the energy region around 1400 mev will excite both resonances , but only one apparent bump will be seen , giving the impression that there is only one resonance .",
    "yet , it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that , given the fact that the two resonances couple very differently to the @xmath3 and @xmath2 states , different reactions can give more weight to one or the other resonance leading to different shapes in the @xmath2 mass distribution .",
    "examples were given there for possible situations and the @xmath14 reaction was suggested as a means to see a case in which much weight is given to the higher mass resonance , resulting in a @xmath2 mass distribution narrower than the nominal one with the peak position shifted by about 20 mev to higher energies .",
    "the lesson learned in that paper is that the shape of the @xmath2 mass distribution obtained for a certain reaction depends drastically on the dynamics of the reaction .",
    "this reopens a problem since the shape of the @xmath0 resonance from the @xmath2 mass distribution was formerly assumed to be an intrinsic property of the resonance and hence independent of the reaction used to produce it .",
    "for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath2 mass distribution was generated assuming @xmath15 with @xmath16 the momentum of the pion in the @xmath2 rest frame . in practice",
    ", this will not necessarily happen , and at least it will not in some reactions .",
    "indeed , if one bears in mind that the @xmath0 resonance is built up from the multiple scattering of the coupled channels , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , one can produce the resonance first by producing any of these channels and then having final state interaction leading to the final @xmath2 state .",
    "hence , instead of eq .  , we should rather have @xmath19 with @xmath20 standing for any of the coupled channels , and the coefficients @xmath21 will depend upon the particular reaction .",
    "if there is one pole around @xmath0 , then the shape of @xmath22 is almost uniquely determined independent of the channel @xmath20 .",
    "however , when there are two poles , it depends on @xmath20 , since the different channel @xmath20 couples to the poles with different strengths  @xcite . therefore , the mass distribution develops one or another shape depending on the coefficients @xmath21 . the fact that this distribution follows eq .   rather than eq .",
    ", was already pointed out in ref .  @xcite .",
    "however , no attempt was done to calculate the @xmath21 coefficients but rather they were fitted to the data to obtain the experimental shape of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the @xmath1 reaction , from which the experimental data of the @xmath0 resonance are usually extracted  @xcite .",
    "another source of experimental information comes from the @xmath23 reaction followed by @xmath24 , @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the dynamics that goes into the @xmath1 reaction , and obtain the coefficients entering eq .   which determine the shape of the @xmath0 .    in the next section ,",
    "we explore the analogy of the @xmath1 reaction with the @xmath26 reaction making an su(3 ) extrapolation of the same low energy @xmath26 model . in section 3",
    ", we show the results with this model , and in section 4 , we look at the contribution of resonance states excited in the s - channel .",
    "results and conclusions are shown in subsequent sections .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly summarize the chiral lagrangian , that we use in the following calculations .",
    "the meson - meson lagrangian at the lowest order needed here takes on the form  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the meson decay constant , @xmath29 is the quark mass matrix @xmath30 , and the symbol @xmath31 denotes trace of su(3 ) matrices .",
    "similarly , following refs .",

    "this means a total center of mass energy @xmath46 gev , or equivalently a three momentum of the initial pion @xmath47 in the laboratory frame .",
    "formally , we can separate the process into two parts .",
    "the first one which involves tree level @xmath48 amplitudes , and a second part which involves the final state interaction @xmath49 , which eventually generates a resonance if kinematical and dynamical conditions allow for it .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "@xcite is that the @xmath53 amplitudes can be factorized on - shell ( as a function of @xmath67 ) inside the meson - baryon loops appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in the present case",
    "there is also an on - shell factorization for the initial process @xmath68 as we discuss briefly .",
    "this process is then followed by the final state interaction , shown by the open blob .    for that purpose ,",
    "let us consider the one loop diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) .",
    "one loop functions for @xmath69.,width=302 ]    in the following , we first show the factorization of the meson - meson amplitude with the momentum @xmath70 on - shell , then show the cancellation of the off - shell part of the meson - meson amplitude associated to the momentum @xmath71 . with these arguments ,",
    "the on - shell factorization of the meson - baryon loops  @xcite can be applied to the present initial process , and we can calculate the whole amplitude by evaluating the initial process at the tree level , separated from the subsequent meson - baryon loops .",
    "let us start with showing that the meson - meson amplitude factorizes in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) with the momentum @xmath70 on - shell .",
    "the @xmath67-wave meson - meson amplitudes from the chiral lagrangians at lowest order have the form  @xcite @xmath72 where the term with @xmath73 gives the off - shell extrapolation of the amplitude . if we take just this off - shell part for the meson of momentum @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) , the loop function reads as @xmath74 using the non relativistic form @xmath75 for the @xmath76 vertex , which will be improved later on to account for relativistic corrections . one should note that in eq .  , the off - shell part of the meson - meson amplitude cancels the meson propagator and leads to a contracted diagram of the type of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( b ) . on the other hand , it is interesting to note that genuine diagrams of the type of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( b ) appear from the consideration of the @xmath77 terms that come from an expansion in the meson fields of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "these terms should be added for consistency . however , by changing @xmath78 to the @xmath79 variable of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( b ) in the loop functions and realizing that the dominant term in the @xmath80 structure of the @xmath77 vertex comes from the @xmath81 component ( and hence no three momentum dependence ) , the loop functions of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] vanish at this order ( corrections coming at order @xmath82 ) .",
    "there is also a cancellation of the off - shell part of the meson - meson amplitude for the meson with momentum @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) .",
    "it appears already at tree level , but it comes from an exact cancellation between the off - shell part of the meson pole term and the contact term .",
    "this fact justifies the attempt to find out the on - shell @xmath83 scattering amplitude from analysis of the @xmath26 data omitting the contact term  @xcite , except for the contribution of other terms in the process  @xcite .",
    "this off - shell cancellation found here is important conceptually . in practice",
    ", we just calculate the meson pole term with the @xmath84 variable off - shell and add the contact term in each case , and the cancellation takes place automatically .",
    "next we look into a possible contribution from the @xmath85-wave part of the meson - meson amplitude .",
    "as anticipated , we are looking at the @xmath1 reaction close to threshold of the @xmath3 production in @xmath86 .",
    "this means that three momenta of the three final particles in the @xmath68 are negligible with respect to their energies .",
    "the on - shell factorization will just pick up the @xmath67-wave part of the @xmath87 amplitude .",
    "one might argue that the @xmath85-wave part of the meson - meson amplitude will not be small when taken inside loops . by looking again to the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) , the @xmath85-wave part of the amplitude would lead to a contribution in the loops of the type @xmath88 since we know that @xmath89 and the @xmath70 integral has a cut off of @xmath90  @xcite , @xmath91 is a small quantity which would allow one to take a constant propagator for the meson of momentum @xmath71 . since @xmath92 , the term with @xmath93 vanishes in the integral , but there remains an integral @xmath94 which should be reasonably smaller than the corresponding term from the meson meson s - wave which is proportional to @xmath95 . yet , there is more to it . with @xmath96 , and @xmath92 ,",
    "the argument of @xmath97 depends on @xmath98 and we are left with an integral of the type @xmath99 after performing the @xmath100 integration , we are left with an integral @xmath101 with @xmath102 the invariant mass of the @xmath103 system and @xmath104 , @xmath105 the meson , baryon energies .",
    "the zero in the denominator of eq .   gets the on - shell condition for a momentum @xmath106 and we can write @xmath107 by neglecting @xmath108 which holds in the heavy baryon limit ( we are all around neglecting @xmath109 terms ) , the off - shell part of eq",
    ".   leads to @xmath110 which is constant in energy .",
    "this energy independent term , multiplying the @xmath111 factor , can be reabsorbed into , for instance , the contact term with the use of renormalized coupling constants , say the physical values of @xmath112 .      with the arguments given above , our approach will require the evaluation of the meson pole and contact terms for the ten coupled channels @xmath113 , using the @xmath67-wave @xmath114 amplitude where the @xmath115 are factorized on - shell .",
    "since we also saw that the intermediate propagator with momenta @xmath71 could also be factorized , this means we factorize the whole @xmath113 amplitude on - shell outside the loop integral .",
    "the remaining loop function contains only the meson of momentum @xmath70 and baryon propagators and this is the @xmath116 function found out in the study of the meson - baryon interaction in ref .",
    "hence the whole amplitude for the process @xmath1 corresponding to the upper diagrams of fig .",

    ", we give the @xmath119 and @xmath120 terms for all the ten channels , where , as mentioned before , we have already assumed the three momenta of the final particle negligible in all channels .    for completeness , we also include a recoil factor from the @xmath121 bbm vertex @xmath122 in addition , we also consider the strong form factor of the @xmath123 vertex for which we take a standard monopole form factor for all vertices @xmath124 with @xmath125 mev .",
    "we take the form factor static to avoid the fictitious poles of the covariant @xmath126 form .",
    "but we have checked that using this latter form only changes the results at the level of less than 5 % .",
    "given the cancellation of the off - shell part of the meson pole term with the contact term , which makes the sum of the two terms independent of a possible unitary transformation in the fields , the form factor is applied both in the meson pole and the contact term .",
    "this is analogous to what is done with the pion pole and kroll - ruderman term in @xmath127 to preserve gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "we perform the calculations for an initial pion momentum of 1.69 gev , at which the experiment is done .",
    "the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution is given by @xmath128 where @xmath29 and @xmath129 are the masses of the nucleon and the baryon of the final state , in this case a @xmath130 , and @xmath131 the mass of the final meson , in this case a @xmath132 .",
    "the distributions are calculated for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath56 in the final states . according to the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath0 photoproduction , the @xmath12 contribution approximately cancels in the sum of the @xmath58 , @xmath59 contributions and the @xmath56 does not have @xmath12 contribution , such that @xmath133 and both distributions give the @xmath13 contribution to the process , hence the @xmath0 contribution .    in fig .",

    "@xcite.,width=302 ]    we can see that the theoretical distribution peaks around 1420 mev while the experimental one has the peak around 1400 mev . the theoretical distribution is also much narrower than experiment .",
    "the disagreement between theory and experiment is apparent .",
    "we can easily trace back the origin of the shape of the theoretical distribution .",
    "indeed , the tree amplitude @xmath113 for the case of @xmath134 involve the combinations @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which are large compared to the @xmath137 combination that we find for @xmath138 ( we take @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) . therefore , that the sum of the terms in eq .   is dominated by the @xmath3 terms , giving a larger weight to the @xmath141 amplitude than to the @xmath142 one . as we mentioned , the @xmath3 states couple strongly to the @xmath0 resonance of higher energy and weakly to the @xmath0 of lower energy .",
    "as a consequence , what we see is a distribution which mostly peaks around the resonance found in ref .",
    "@xcite at the pole position @xmath143 mev , with a width of around 30 mev .",
    "the slightly smaller energy of the peak in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and larger width reflects the small contribution of the resonance of lower energies , also present in the @xmath141 , as well as from the @xmath142 amplitudes in the sum of eq .  , which are dominated by the lower energy @xmath0 resonance .",
    "this latter one appears at @xmath144 mev .",
    "since we have @xmath46 gev , one could think of the possibility of having resonance excitation in the @xmath145 collision leading to the decay of the resonance in @xmath123 .",
    "we would like to have some resonance that can couple to the @xmath123 strongly in @xmath67-wave .",
    "all @xmath146 baryon resonances in the region of @xmath147 mev correspond to higher partial waves in the @xmath145 collision , except for the @xmath148 and the @xmath149 , which are @xmath150 resonances with the same quantum numbers of the nucleon  @xcite . out of these two",
    ", the @xmath148 resonance has a very large branching ratio to @xmath151 ( 40 - 90% ) , while the one of the @xmath149 is unknown , probably small , since the large branching ratio seems to be for @xmath152 ( with large errors ) .",
    "we thus rely upon the @xmath148 resonance to provide some contribution to the @xmath1 process .",
    "although one can derive different couplings of this resonance to the @xmath123 in an su(3 ) scheme ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for analogy in other @xmath150 resonances ) , the absence of the kinematically allowed @xmath153 channel in the decay mode of the @xmath148 strongly suggest a weinberg - tomozawa like coupling where this mode is strictly forbidden at the tree level ( see @xmath154 coefficients in refs .",
    "this also has the implicit assumption that the @xmath148 resonance belongs to an su(3 ) octet representation , which is the option adopted in the particle data table  @xcite .",

    "the mechanism alone leads to a @xmath2 mass distribution in strong disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "on the other hand , it was found that there are complementary mechanisms exciting @xmath163 resonances from the @xmath166 entrance channel .",
    "inspection of the partial waves involved in the resonance excitations and the decay modes singled out a resonance which gives contribution to the process , the @xmath148 , with the same quantum numbers of the nucleon . the strong @xmath167 decay channel together with the absence of the @xmath168 channel , suggested a coupling of the @xmath148 resonance to @xmath169 of the su(3 ) weinberg - tomozawa type , which we exploited to see the consequences in the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "we observed that this new mechanism had an opposite behavior to the chiral one , and strongly stressed the @xmath2 intermediate state instead of the @xmath3 , leading to a production amplitude dominated by the @xmath142 amplitude .",
    "since this amplitude is dominated by the wide resonance peaking around 1390 mev , we found that the @xmath2 mass distribution roughly followed the shape of this resonance and was wide and peaking at an energy below 1400 mev .",
    "the coherent sum of the two mechanism was shown to lead to total cross sections and a mass distribution compatible with the experiment , within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "the exercise done here shows the important role played by the two resonance poles in the production process of the nominal @xmath0 resonance .",
    "we could see how two different mechanisms ( chiral and @xmath148 terms ) filtered each one of the resonance contributions , and then how the coherent sum of the amplitudes from the two mechanisms could describe the data .",
    "the present exercise has shown the non - triviality of the @xmath0 generation , which has been given for granted in all previous theoretical studies .",
    "indeed , one needs to make a careful theoretical study of each reaction in order to understand the nature of the resonance from the observed shape of the @xmath2 mass distribution .",

    "<S> we discuss the mechanisms that lead to @xmath0 production in the @xmath1 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the problem has gained renewed interest after different works converge to the conclusion that there are two resonances around the region of 1400 mev , rather than one , and that they couple differently to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels . </S>",
    "<S> we look at the dynamics of that reaction and find two mechanisms which eventually filter each one of the resonances , leading to very different shapes of the @xmath2 invariant mass distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of the two mechanisms leads to a shape of this distribution compatible with the experimental measurements . </S>"
