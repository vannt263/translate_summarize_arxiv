    "one of the most profound discoveries of observational physics is that the universe is accelerating in its expansion .",
    "evidence for this acceleration is provided by recent supernovae data together with measured cmb anisotropies and large scale structure data @xcite . despite a large number of attempts to explain this striking phenomenon ( for example , _ dark energy _ associated to some new scalar field  @xcite or a cosmological constant  @xcite )",
    "all current models require at least some degree of fine - tuning and are incomplete . due to the lack of a satisfactory explanation",
    ", it seems reasonable to consider the possibility that the observed acceleration is an indication that general relativity requires some sort of low - energy modification  @xcite .",
    "this radical possibility motivated the recent work of carroll , duvvuri , trodden and turner ( cdtt )  @xcite .",
    "these authors considered a simple modification to the einstein - hilbert action of the form @xmath0 , with @xmath1 .",
    "they showed that under certain circumstances such models can lead to late - time acceleration of the expanding universe . in these notes ,",
    "i review the basic principles of the cdtt model and explain how these principles can be applied to more general modified graviational models  @xcite .",
    "the cosmic evolution of our universe is believed to be described by the einstein - hilbert action ( coupled to matter ) s = d^4x r + d^4x _ m , [ seh ] where @xmath2 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath3 is the ricci scalar constructed from the metric tensor @xmath4 and @xmath5 represents some matter lagrangian .",
    "let us consider modifications of ( [ seh ] ) , of the general form s = d^4x f(r , , ,  ) + d^4x _ m , [ semod ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ricci and riemann tensors , respectively . in the literature ,",
    "such modifications have been used to obtain early - time inflation ( for example , starobinsky considered @xmath8__conformal anomaly in  @xcite ) and to try to eliminate curvature singularities in cosmological and black hole spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "unlike these high curvature examples , in order to explain late - time cosmic acceleration , we are interested in modifications that become important at _ low curvatures_. we will see that such modified models can lead to late - time accelerating vacuum solutions , providing a _ purely gravitational _ alternative to dark energy . _ _      the first examples of these low - curvature modifications where presented by cdtt and involved simple inverse - powers of the ricci scalar ( @xmath9 , where @xmath1 and @xmath10 is some new scale in the theory )  @xcite . by considering only inverse powers of @xmath3 , we exclude minkowski space as a solution and ensure that the correction term dominates the action only at low curvatures . as a toy model ,",
    "consider the case when @xmath11 , s = d^4x ( r - ) + d^4x _ m . [ scdtt ] here @xmath12 is a new scale in the theory with dimensions of mass . assuming a flat , friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric : ds^2=-dt^2+a^2(t)d ^2 , the modified friedmann equation ( in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath13 ) is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the matter energy density and we have assumed a perfect - fluid energy - momentum tensor t _",

    "it is a trivial task to map this theory to an einstein frame with einstein - hilbert action minimally coupled to a scalar field @xmath16 with potential @xmath17 this potential is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "= 4.0 in    in this model there is a singularity corresponding to @xmath18 . from the plot of @xmath19",
    "it is clear that this model exhibits three different possible cosmological behaviors , depending on the initial conditions for the field @xmath20 and its velocity @xmath21 ( where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time coordinate of the einstein frame ) .",
    "the field @xmath16 can either roll back down the potential toward a future singularity at @xmath18 , come to rest at the top of the potential ( corresponding to an unstable de sitter phase ) or roll off to infinity leading to late - time , power - law cosmic acceleration with equation of state parameter @xmath22 .",
    "these basic features are not affected by the addition of matter . by choosing @xmath23 ,",
    "the modifications to einstein gravity only become important recently , making this theory a candidate to explain the observed acceleration of the universe .",
    "it is important to point out this model is different from other models with scalar fields that attempt to explain dark energy , because our field is _ non - minimally coupled to matter .",
    "if the matter is added directly in the gravity frame ( [ scdtt ] ) , the einstein - frame matter density is related to @xmath24 by = ( -2 ) . _",
    "this simple model is easily generalized to corrections of the form @xmath25 .",
    "these generalizations maintain the desirable late - time accelerating solutions with behavior analogous to dark energy with equation of state parameter w_eff=-1 + .",
    "it is , therefore , easy to construct models of this type that obey the observational constraints on the equation of state parameter @xmath26 ( at the 95% confidence level )  @xcite .",
    "these simple models provide a new approach to understanding the dark energy problem .",
    "@xmath27 theories can have difficulties satisfying certain observational constraints ( for example , solar system constraints )  @xcite . a simple way to understand",
    "this is the following . by introducing a new scalar field @xmath28 , the action ( [ semod ] ) with @xmath29 a function only of @xmath3 , is equivalent to s = d^4x ( f ( ) + f ( ) ( r-))+ d^4x _ m , [ actsasha ] where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "the absence of a kinetic term for @xmath28 in ( [ actsasha ] ) , means that this theory can be written as a brans - dicke type theory , which is of the general form : s d^4x ( r - _ ^- u())+ s_m , [ actbd ] with brans - dicke parameter @xmath30 .",
    "if the scalar field is very light ( as in the cdtt model ) there are constraints on @xmath31 from solar system tests that give @xmath32  @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , some possible ways of resolving these instabilities in general are discussed in  @xcite . ]",
    "as we have seen , the ability to map the @xmath27 theory to an einstein frame makes interpretation of solutions particularly simple . in these notes",
    "we would like to consider more complicated modifications such as @xmath33 .",
    "it is not always possible to map these general models to a familiar einstein frame and we must , therefore , develop new methods for studying such systems . a specific technique is presented in our recent paper  @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss a few simple examples of more general modified gravitational models .",
    "to begin we search for general features of such models .",
    "consider the action s= d^4x ( r + f(r , p , q ) ) + d^4x _ m , [ sgmg ] with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . by defining @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",

    "this is physically well motivate since we are interested in studying the new cosmological features induced by the purely gravitational sector of the theory .",
    "mathematically , this provides us with valuable insight into the structure of the equations .    to ensure that minkowski space is not an allowed solution we consider modifications involving inverse powers of curvature invariants .",
    "it is likely that the addition of such terms will introduce ghost degrees of freedom into the theory .",
    "if ghosts arise we shall require that some unknown mechanism ( for example , extra - dimensional effects ) cut off the theory in such a way that the associated instabilities do not appear on cosmological time scales .",
    "the first general feature of the vacuum solutions of ( [ equaz ] ) , is the existence of constant curvature solutions . to see this ,",
    "we take the trace of  ( [ equaz ] ) and substitute @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( which are identities satisfied by constant curvature spacetimes ) into the resulting equation to obtain the algebraic equation : @xmath42 solving this equation for the ricci scalar yields the constant curvature ( de sitter ) vacuum solutions with @xmath43 .",
    "this is a very general property of actions of the form  ( [ sgmg ] ) .",
    "however , an equally generic feature of such models is that this de sitter solution is unstable . in the cdtt model ,",
    "the instability is to an accelerating power - law attractor .",
    "we will see a similar trend in many of the more general models under consideration here .    for simplicity ,",
    "we now specialize to a class of actions with @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a positive integer , @xmath12 has dimensions of mass and @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are dimensionless constants . in this case , there are power - law attractors with the following ( real ) exponents @xmath49 where @xmath50    two special cases are @xmath51 for which the power law attractors , @xmath52 are @xmath53 having discovered some basic common features of these general models ( de sitter repeller and power - law attractor solutions ) , let us consider some specific examples in greater detail .      for the simplest case , when @xmath54 , the model is simply that of cdtt with modified friedmann equation given by ( [ newfriedmann ] ) .",
    "one way to analyze this system ( without going to an einstein frame ) is to simply plot the phase space of solutions ( see fig.([fig2 ] ) ) .",
    "= 3.5 in    recall , a generic feature of the models considered here is an unstable de sitter solution ( obtained from eq .",
    "( [ constcurvexp ] ) ) . for the above case of @xmath55 ,",
    "the de sitter solution is located at the point @xmath56 in the @xmath57-phase plane depicted in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "the late time power law attractor has @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "hence , such attractor solutions appear as curves @xmath61 , ( @xmath62 ) in the phase portrait . in the case",
    "@xmath63 , there is only one late - time power - law attractor with @xmath64 .",
    "following this example , we proceed to examine more complicated modified theories .",
    "consider a modification of the form @xmath65 .",
    "the trace equation ( [ constcurvexp ] ) , indicates the de sitter constant curvature solution occurs for @xmath66 .",

    "one of these corresponds to an accelerator with @xmath73 , while the other is not an accelerating solution with @xmath74 .",
    "both attractor solutions along with the de sitter solution are easily identified in the phase space portrait given in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "= 3.5 in      in the case of @xmath75 we find from the trace equation that the constant curvature de sitter solution is given by @xmath76 .",
    "the modified friedmann equation is = 0  , which does not admit _ any _ late - time power - law attractors .",
    "we have described how a late - time period of cosmic acceleration emerges naturally in certain modified gravitational models .",
    "the models in @xcite involve inverse powers of linear combinations of curvature invariants . clearly , the modified gravitational models described in these notes are only a small handful of a much richer set of possible theories",
    ". the late - time accelerating vacuum solutions we have discussed are not severely affected by the inclusion of matter . a simple way to understand",
    "this is the following . in an expanding universe the curvature invariants",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are all decreasing with time .",
    "therefore , any modifications of einstein gravity that are inverse powers of such invariants are growing with time .",
    "if the universe is initially matter dominated , these growing correction terms will eventually come to dominate the action .",
    "it is an intriguing possibility that the observed cosmic acceleration of our universe may be a consequence of some low - curvature modified gravitational theory .",
