    "collapse models were formulated to describe in a unified framework the behavior of microscopic systems , as accounted for by quantum mechanics , and the emergence of the objective macroscopic world , described by classical mechanics .",
    "after the pioneering works by pearle @xcite , the first consistent collapse model was put forward by ghirardi , rimini and weber ( grw ) @xcite ; see @xcite for more details and a list of references about the historical development of collapse models .",
    "the crucial feature of the grw model is that the wavefunction associated with the state of a physical system undergoes sudden and random localization processes .",
    "the latter do not practically affect microscopic systems , while they become relevant already on very short time scales for macroscopic systems , by virtue of the amplification mechanism .",
    "the localization processes prevent macroscopic systems from being in a superposition of states centered around macroscopically distinct positions .",
    "in addition , since any measurement process consists in an interaction between a microscopic system and a macroscopic measurement apparatus , the localization processes give a dynamical explanation of the collapse of the wavefunction to one of the eigenstates of the measured observable , without the need of introducing an ad - hoc reduction postulate @xcite .",
    "the non - linear and stochastic nature of the reduction postulate in standard quantum mechanics is replaced within collapse models by a modification of the schrdinger equation which includes proper non - linear and stochastic terms .",
    "one of the main advantages of collapse models is that , besides the relevant conceptual differences with respect to the standard theory , they provide experimentally testable predictions which depart from those of quantum mechanics @xcite ; see @xcite for a detailed list of references .",
    "in particular , collapse models call into question the universal nature of the superposition principle , as they set a fundamental limit above which no physical system can exhibit position superpositions , except for a negligibly small time .",
    "the investigation of collapse models thus plays a significant role in the experimental tests on the boundaries between the classical and the quantum description of reality at the mesoscopic and macroscopic scale .",
    "will it be possible to prepare quantum superpositions for more and more complex systems with the future advances of the experimental techniques , or is there an intrinsic limit which will prevent from this , as predicted by collapse models ?",
    "the renewed interest in collapse models and the demand to compare their predictions with actual experimental data coming from very different setups has further motivated the formulation of more realistic models .",
    "the initial idea that the non - linear and stochastic modification of the schrdinger equation represents an intrinsic property of nature , was then superseded by the view that the collapse of the wavefunction is induced by a physical field filling space , which acts as a universal noise .",
    "indeed , the precise definition of such a field needs the formulation of a new fundamental theory going beyond standard quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "hence , collapse models should be understood as phenomenological models , which capture the main effects of the interaction with the above - mentioned noise .",
    "basic physical principles set some general constraints on the features of the admissible models .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , for the absence of faster - than - light signaling @xcite or the principle of energy conservation .",
    "an important drawback of the grw model is the violation of the energy conservation : the stochastic action of the noise induces larger and larger fluctuations in the momentum space , so that the energy of the system diverges for asymptotic times , although with a rate which is very small @xcite .",
    "this is a common feature of the first collapse models @xcite and it traces back to the absence of any dissipative mechanism within the interaction between the system and the noise @xcite , as also witnessed by the structure of the master equations which can be associated with these models .    in this paper , we modify the grw model in order to avoid the divergence in time of the energy , thus making an important step toward the reestablishment of the energy conservation within the model .",
    "we explicitly show that this can be achieved via the introduction of new localization operators , without changing the other defining features of the model .",
    "this provides us with a more realistic collapse model , while we keep the original effectiveness and physical transparency of the grw model .",
    "the convergence of the energy of the system to a finite value allows us to associate the noise with a finite temperature @xmath0 , such that the grw model is recovered in the high temperature limit @xmath1 .",
    "we follow a strategy similar to that exploited for a simplified collapse model @xcite and based on the formal analogy with a lindblad master equation @xcite including dissipation . besides discussing in detail the physical consequences of the extension of the model",
    ", we also express both the original and the generalized grw models in terms of a stochastic differential equation .",
    "this analysis , which relies on the framework of the stochastic differential equations of jump type in hilbert spaces @xcite , fills a gap with respect to collapse models with localization continuous in time  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "let us start by briefly recalling the main features of the collapse model introduced by ghirardi , rimini and weber @xcite .",
    "the grw model can be formulated in terms of discrete jumps of the wavefunction which represents the state of the system taken into account . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we consider a particle in one dimension and we neglect spin and other internal degrees of freedom , so that the wavefunction @xmath2 is an element of the hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics of the particle is then characterized through the following assumptions :    * at random times the particle experiences a sudden jump described by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the state immediately before the jump , which occurs at time @xmath6 and position @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the self - adjoint contractive linear operator defined as @xmath9 with @xmath10 the position operator of the particle and @xmath11 a new parameter of the model . * the overall number of jumps is distributed in time according to a poisson process with rate @xmath12 , which is the second new parameter of the model .",
    "the standard value of the rate is @xmath13 , while a higher rate was proposed more recently @xcite , @xmath14 . * if there is a jump at time @xmath6 , the probability density that it takes place at the position @xmath15 is @xmath16 * in the time interval between two consecutive jumps , the state vector evolves according to the usual schrdinger equation .",
    "as will be shown in the following , see sec.[sec : this ] , this dynamics can be equivalently formulated through a stochastic differential equation .",
    "moreover , the jump operators @xmath17 satisfy the relation @xmath18 which corresponds to the normalization of the probability distribution @xmath19 defined in eq.([eq : py ] ) .",
    "the jump operator @xmath17 describes a localization process around the position @xmath15 and with width @xmath20 .",
    "consider a gaussian wavefunction @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mean position , @xmath24 the mean momentum , while @xmath25 determines the position variance @xmath26 and the momentum variance @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the normalization constant .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath29 after the jump , see eq.([eq : jj ] ) , is still gaussian : apart from an irrelevant global phase , one has @xmath30 , where @xmath31 with @xmath32 the mean value of the momentum does not change , while the mean value of the position is shifted toward the localization position @xmath15 .",
    "the position variance decreases and hence after the jump the particle is more localized : the reciprocals of @xmath33 and @xmath34 sum up and give the reciprocal of the new variance @xmath35 . importantly , the latter does not depend on the position of the localization process .",
    "for large gaussian wave packets , such that @xmath36 , one has @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the effects of the localization process on the gaussian wavefunction are summarized in fig.[fig:1]*(a)*. in addition , the probability that the localization process occurs around @xmath15 is , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : py ] ) , @xmath39    * ( a ) * + , see eq.([eq : gaus ] ) , and * ( b ) * a superposition of gaussian wavefunctions @xmath40 , see eq.([eq : sovr ] ) .",
    "the position probability distribution @xmath41 before the localization is given by the blue dashed line , the probability distribution after the localization @xmath42 is given by the black dot dashed line , while the red line represents the normalized gaussian distribution associated with the jump operator , see eq.([eq : locop ] ) .",
    "the states after the localization are given by eq.([eq : sxgrw ] ) , * ( a ) * , and by eq.([eq : cmp ] ) with @xmath43 , * ( b)*.,title=\"fig : \" ] , see eq.([eq : gaus ] ) , and * ( b ) * a superposition of gaussian wavefunctions @xmath40 , see eq.([eq : sovr ] ) .",

    "consider a particle which is in the state @xmath44 given by the superposition of two gaussian wavefunctions with null mean momentum and the same variance , one centered around the position @xmath45 , the other around @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a normalization constant .",
    "the state after the localization around @xmath15 , @xmath50 is still the superposition of two gaussian functions ; the normalization constant @xmath51 depends on where the localization takes place . now , consider a localization process around @xmath45 and assume that the distance between the two gaussians is much greater than the localization amplitude , while their width is much smaller than it , i.e. @xmath52 . the previous formula directly gives @xmath53 so that the gaussian centered around the localization position @xmath45 is left almost unchanged , while the gaussian centered around @xmath46 is suppressed by a factor @xmath54 .",
    "the localization process practically destroys the superposition between the two gaussian wavefunctions , leading to a single gaussian state localized around @xmath45 , see fig.[fig:1]*(b)*. in addition , by further exploiting @xmath55 , one finds that the probability of a localization in a neighborhood of @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 : the definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : locop ] ) and ( [ eq : py ] ) allow to recover the usual born s rule for the probability distributions @xcite ; see also appendix [ app : sovr ] .",
    "the grw model is fully determined by the stochastic evolution of the wavefunction @xmath58 previously presented .",
    "however , it is often convenient to deal with the dynamics of the statistical operator which describes the state of the system averaged over all the possible trajectories built up by the different combinations of schrdinger evolutions and localization processes , see also sec .",
    "[ sec : me ] .",
    "the equation of motion of the statistical operator @xmath59 , i.e. , the master equation for the grw model reads @xmath60 + \\lambda\\left(\\int { \\mathrm{d}}y \\ , l_y(\\widehat{x } ) \\hat{\\rho}(t ) l_y(\\widehat{x } )   -\\hat{\\rho}(t ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left[\\widehat{h } \\,,\\ , \\hat{\\rho}(t)\\right ] + \\lambda\\left(\\left(\\pi   { r_c}^2 \\right)^{-1/2 } \\int { \\mathrm{d}}y \\,e^{- ( \\widehat{x } - y)^2/(2   { r_c}^2 ) } \\hat{\\rho}(t)e^{- ( \\widehat{x } - y)^2/(2   { r_c}^2 ) }   -\\hat{\\rho}(t ) \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term describes the standard quantum evolution induced by the hamiltonian @xmath61 , while the second term accounts for the occurrence of the localization processes .",
    "equation ( [ eq : megrw ] ) establishes a semigroup evolution @xcite with pure decoherence in position : the off - diagonal terms in the position representation are suppressed , and distant superpositions are suppressed faster than closer ones .",
    "the master equation associated with the collapse model allows to investigate relevant features , such as the extension to an @xmath62-particle system and then the amplification mechanism , as well as the asymptotic behavior of the energy of the system .",
    "now , consider an @xmath62-particle system in which the localization processes occur individually for each constituent , so that the master equation associated with the @xmath62-particle statistical operator @xmath63 is simply @xmath64 + \\sum_j \\lambda_j\\left(\\int { \\mathrm{d}}y \\ , l_y(\\widehat{x}_j ) \\hat{\\varrho}(t ) l_y(\\widehat{x}_j )   -\\hat{\\varrho}(t ) \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a shorthand notation for @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the identity operator on the hilbert space associated with the @xmath68-th particle , and @xmath69 is the position operator of the @xmath70-th particle , see eq.([eq : locop ] ) . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : ampl ] , the hypothesis of individual localization processes has to be considered with a certain caution .",
    "it is useful to introduce the center of mass coordinates through the invertible linear transformation @xmath71 with @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the mass of the @xmath70-th particle and @xmath74 the total mass , .",
    "accordingly @xmath75 is the center - of - mass coordinate , while @xmath76 are the relative coordinates .",
    "the position of the @xmath70-th particle can be expressed as @xmath77 one can then easily prove the relation @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the partial trace with respect to the relative degrees of freedom . hence ,",
    "if we assume that the total hamiltonian is the sum of a term associated with the center of mass and a term associated with the internal motion , i.e. @xmath80 we find that the state of the center of mass , @xmath81 satisfies the same master equation as that in eq.([eq : megrw ] ) , with the one particle hamiltonian @xmath61 replaced by @xmath82 and , most importantly , the localization rate @xmath12 replaced by @xmath83 .",
    "this is a direct manifestation of the amplification mechanism , which , along with localization , is the crucial feature of the grw model .",
    "it explains why the model describes both microscopic and macroscopic systems . the localization rate @xmath12 ( assume @xmath84 for the sake of simplicity ) of microscopic systems is negligible and therefore the predictions of the grw model about the wavefunction of microscopic systems reproduce for all practical purposes the predictions of standard quantum mechanics .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider a macroscopic object , the rate @xmath85 , with @xmath62 of the order of the avogadro s number , induces a localization of the center of mass on very short time scales : the wavefunctions of macroscopic objects are almost always well - localized in space , so that their centers of mass behave , for all the practical purposes , according to classical mechanics .",
    "a well - known drawback of the grw model is that it predicts an infinite increase of the energy of the system .",
    "this energy divergence is due to larger and larger fluctuations of the momentum induced by the interplay between the schrdinger evolution and the localization mechanism , as will be explicitly discussed in sec.[sec : lmaei ] .",
    "nevertheless , the infinite increase of the energy can be inferred directly from the master equation ( [ eq : megrw ] ) .",
    "in fact , this master equation predicts a linear increase of the mean value of the energy of the system with a rate @xcite @xmath86 this rate of the energy increase is actually very small , @xmath87 for a nucleon , even if one considers the @xmath62-particle case @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that from a fundamental point of view one would like to avoid the energy divergence and point to a reestablishment of the energy conservation principle within the model .",
    "this forces us to put forward a more realistic description of the interaction between the system and the noise , also in order to test whether and how possible mechanisms excluding infinite energy increase modify the testable predictions of the model @xcite .",
    "the use of the master equation formalism suggests a way out from the problem of the energy divergence . despite the deep conceptual differences between collapse models and the notion of decoherence , the same master equation associated with the grw model can be also derived in a specific model of collisional decoherence @xcite .",
    "this correspondence clarifies that the origin of the energy divergence in the grw model can be ascribed to the lack of a dissipation mechanism , which would account for the energy loss of the system due to the action of the noise . by taking into account the master equation which generalizes eq.([eq : megrw ] ) to include dissipation @xcite , we have thus been led to a possible structure of a new jump operator replacing that in eq.([eq : locop ] ) and excluding the energy divergence .",
    "indeed , this was a preliminary benchmark , but the choice of the jump operator in a collapse model is subjected to further constraints , the most relevant being the induction of localization . in addition , the definition of a collapse model in terms of the different trajectories within the hilbert space can be done without reference to any subsequent master equation or decoherence model . for these reasons ,",
    "we present our results by first postulating a new localization operator and , as a consequence , a new collapse model and only after that we derive the corresponding master equation , see sec.[sec : me ] .",
    "in this paper , we propose the following extension of the grw model : the jump operators @xmath17 defined in eq.([eq : locop ] ) are replaced with @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the momentum operator of the system , @xmath90 the mass of the particle and @xmath91 a new parameter of the model , which is related with the temperature of the noise inducing the localization .",
    "this will be explicitly shown in sec.[sec : therm ] , where the specific choice of @xmath92 , as well as its peculiar role in the definition of @xmath93 , will be discussed .",
    "note that the jump operators of the model are no longer self - adjoint .",
    "an equivalent way to express @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 by which one immediately sees how the original grw jump operator @xmath17 , see eq.([eq : locop ] ) , is obtained in the limit @xmath95 . on the other hand , the general structure provided by items 1 - 4 in the previous section is left untouched .",
    "explicitly , our collapse model can be formulated as follows :    * the sudden jumps are now described by @xmath96 * the overall number of jumps is still distributed in time according to a poisson process with rate @xmath12 . *",
    "if there is a jump at time @xmath6 , the probability density that the jump takes place at the position @xmath15 is now given by @xmath97 * still , between two consecutive jumps the state vector evolves according to the schrdinger equation .",
    "it is important to observe that the jump operators satisfy a normalization condition as in eq.([eq : normgrw ] ) ; explicitly , @xmath98 this property guarantees that the probability distribution @xmath19 associated with the localization position is properly normalized , see eq.([eq : pyd ] ) , and its role within the model will be further discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : edsme ] .",
    "as will be shown extensively in the following , the replacement of @xmath17 with @xmath93 preserves all the desired features of the resulting collapse model , while the dependence on the momentum operator @xmath89 prevents the infinite energy increase and thus leads to a more realistic description of the action of the noise .",
    "the role of the jump operator @xmath93 is illustrated directly by evaluating its action on a gaussian wavefunction @xmath21 , see eq.([eq : gaus ] ) .",
    "the gaussian structure of the wavefunction is preserved and , specifically , one has that the state after the jump , see eq.([eq : jjd ] ) , is @xmath99 , with @xmath100 where we introduced the adimensional quantity @xmath101 which will be crucial in the following analysis , as well as @xmath102 the jump shifts the mean value of the position toward @xmath15 , and , now , it also damps the mean value of the momentum .",
    "the variance @xmath103 after the jump does not depend on where the jump takes place and it is given by the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the contribution due to the @xmath89-dependent term causes a slight increase of the wave - function width , which partially counterbalances the decrease due to the usual grw contribution . for gaussian wavefunctions such that @xmath106 is smaller than the threshold value @xmath107",
    "the jump induced by @xmath93 will increase overall the position variance .",
    "contrary to the original grw model , the repeated action of the jump operators does not induce an unlimited contraction of the wavefunction : there is a lower threshold under which the jump processes cease to be localization processes .",
    "in realistic situations , this threshold value is not reached by the evolution , see eq.([eq : asvar ] ) and the following discussion .",
    "however , @xmath108 plays a crucial role in fixing the asymptotic finite value of the energy , see sec .",
    "[ sec : therm ] .",
    "let us note that , as in the original grw model , the wavefuction after the localization process is non - vanishing over the whole space .",
    "this is the so - called problem of the tails in collapse models @xcite and , indeed , the introduction of dissipation leaves it unaltered .    the probability density for a jump to take place at the position @xmath15 is , see eq.([eq : pyd ] ) , @xmath109 finally , by taking into account the action of @xmath93 on a superposition of two gaussian wavefunctions as in eq.([eq : sovr ] ) , with @xmath110",
    ", one can show along the same lines as for the original grw model , see appendix [ app : sovr ] , that also in this case the localization process destroys the superposition and selects a single gaussian wavefunction , see fig.[fig:1 ] * ( b ) * , with a probability which corresponds to the usual born s rule .",
    "in the previous section , we have extended the grw model by introducing new jump operators , while leaving the general structure of the collapse model untouched .",
    "the dynamics of the wavefunction consists in a unitary evolution interrupted by sudden discontinuous transformations ( jumps ) at random and separated times .",
    "the stochastic differential equations which usually define collapse models are governed by wiener processes @xcite , so that they do not supply the piecewise deterministic evolution now recalled .",
    "however , we will show in this section how also the generalized grw model can be formulated by postulating a stochastic differential equation .",
    "the latter determines the trajectories in the hilbert space of the system through a random field , i.e. a family of stochastic processes , one for each point of space @xmath7 . as for the other collapse models ,",
    "this equation has to be understood as a phenomenological equation , whose fundamental motivation has to be looked for by some underlying theory beyond standard quantum mechanics @xcite . in the proper limit , we will also get a stochastic differential equation for the original grw model .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further details and a rigorous treatment of the stochastic differential equations with jumps in hilbert spaces .",

    "( [ eq : t ] ) justifies our initial choice for the numerical value of @xmath92 : it yields the same order of magnitude of the temperature as the continuous collapse model analyzed in @xcite .",
    "crucially , this value also points out how a proper collapse noise does not need suspicious and ad hoc properties .",
    "a classical noise with typical cosmological features ( low temperature ) can guarantee the collapse of the wavefunction , along with the thermalization to a finite energy @xcite . finally , as expected , in the limit @xmath95 we recover an infinite temperature of the noise , corresponding to the original grw model .",
    "the dissipation rate is @xmath297 , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ht ] ) and ( [ eq : rrate ] ) and therefore its ratio with the collapse rate is @xmath298 the condition @xmath299 guarantees that the collapse occurs on a time scale @xmath300 much shorter than the time scale @xmath301 of dissipation .",
    "in addition , recall that the collapse rate @xmath12 is not modified by the introduction of the dissipation , see secs .",
    "[ sec : egm ] and [ sec : this ] .",
    "any experimental investigation on the effects of collapse models on short time scales will thus not be able to highlight a significant role of the extended dissipative grw model with respect to the original one .",
    "on the other hand , the exponential relaxation of the energy to a finite value drastically changes the predictions of the model for the experiments which involve the secular behavior of the energy @xcite .",
    "the most important example is provided by the heating of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which up to now yields the second strongest upper bound to the localization rate @xcite .",
    "such a bound has been derived by considering the continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) collapse model , which allows to deal with the fermi or bose statistics for identical particles .",
    "hence , the influence of dissipation on the predictions on the secular behavior of the energy has been evaluated in @xcite , where we extended the csl model in order to include dissipation .",
    "it is worth noting how the asymptotic value of the energy is fixed by the threshold value introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : egm ] , see eq.([eq : soglia ] ) .",
    "recall that the jump operators cease to induce a localization of the wavefunction for gaussian wave packets with a position spread smaller than @xmath302 as already noticed , the hamiltonian part of the master equation does not give any contribution to the evolution equation of the mean value of the energy .",
    "this means that the same equation would be obtained by starting from a master equation as eq.([eq : megrwdiss ] ) , but without the hamiltonian term @xcite .",
    "such a master equation can be thought as given by the statistical mean of the stochastic differential equation , compare with eq.([eq : edsnl ] ) , @xmath303 the trajectories provided by this equation are fixed by the action of the jumps operators only .",
    "now , for the sake of simplicity , consider an initial minimum uncertainty gaussian state as in eq.([eq : gaus ] ) .",
    "its position variance @xmath172 is increasingly contracted by the action of the jumps operator , see eq.([eq : xps ] ) , until it reaches the threshold value in eq.([eq : thrd ] ) , which represents the asymptotic value of @xmath149 for the trajectories of eq.([eq : aux ] ) .",
    "but then , since the initial minimum uncertainty gaussian state has remained a minimum uncertainty gaussian state due to the absence of the free schrdinger evolution , the asymptotic value of the momentum variance will be @xmath304 .",
    "as the mean value of the momentum @xmath305 relaxes to zero , @xmath306 determines the asymptotic value of the mean energy as @xmath307 , which is the value in eq.([eq : has ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize once more that this description does not correspond to what actually happens in the collapse model fixed by eq.([eq : edsnl ] ) , but characterizes an auxiliary model , fixed by eq.([eq : aux ] ) , which gives the same predictions as the extended grw model , as long as the statistical mean value of the energy is concerned .",
    "as recalled in sec . [ sec : amaed ] , the amplification mechanism is a basic feature of any collapse model .",
    "the localization of the wavefunction due to the jumps has to increase with the number of the constituents of the system , as well as with its overall mass . in this section ,",
    "we show that such a mechanism can be proved also in the presence of dissipation , if a rigid body is taken into account .",
    "we also argue that the description of more complex systems , in which the internal dynamics plays a significant role , calls for a more realistic and detailed characterization of the @xmath62-particle evolution than that regularly used in collapse models .",
    "let us start by dealing with an @xmath62-particle system subject to localization processes occurring individually for each constituent , which means that the overall effect of the noise consists simply in the sum of the independent effects on the single particles , see sec .",
    "[ sec : amaed ] . in the next paragraph",
    ", we will see how the validity of this assumption breaks down if the internal motion of the system has to be taken into account .",

    "( [ eq : repl ] ) , has a proper physical meaning just if one takes into account a rigid body . in different situations",
    ", one would generally need and also expect a more complex analysis , which encompasses the interrelationship between the mutual interaction of the @xmath62 particles and the action of the noise .",
    "we will develop such an analysis in a future and dedicated work .",
    "once again , the purpose of our investigation should be clear : in our view collapse models are to be understood as phenomenological models and the limits of the first simpler models can be highlighted and overcome by searching for more realistic characterizations .",
    "first , let us examine a simple example , which starts from the study put forward in @xcite ; we will draw , however , different conclusions . consider the two - particle state given by @xmath327 , so that @xmath328 with @xmath329 the normalization constant .",
    "this is a product state with respect to the partition of the total hilbert space in terms of the center of mass and relative degrees of freedom , while it describes an entangled state of the two particles .",
    "we set @xmath330 , so that @xmath331 , while , as usual , @xmath332 .",
    "now , suppose that a localization process centered at a position @xmath15 affects particle 1 and that we can describe such a process through the operator @xmath333 .",
    "the localization process is assumed to influence individually each constituent of the @xmath62-particle system : its action on particle 1 is independent from particle 2 .",
    "hence , by using eq.([eq : braxl ] ) one has @xmath334 and therefore the state after the collision , @xmath335 , can be written as @xmath336 which now also includes entanglement between the center of mass and the relative degrees of freedom .",
    "the mean values of the center of mass and relative positions after the localization process are @xmath337 now , we can associate the initial relative state @xmath338 with the ground state of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator . in the spirit of @xcite",
    ", we can describe a two - atom or a two - nucleon ground state by setting properly the wavefunction width @xmath35 .",
    "we take @xmath339 for the atoms and @xmath340 for the nucleons , so that the level spacing @xmath341 of the corresponding harmonic oscillator is of the order of , respectively , @xmath342 and @xmath343 , as it must be . in both cases",
    "one has @xmath344 and thus , if we also assume @xmath345 , the mean values in eq.([eq : meanbgrw ] ) can be well approximated as @xmath346 analogously , one can show that the two position variances are left almost unchanged ; namely , after the localization one has @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "the probability for the localization process to take place at the position @xmath15 is @xmath349 this provides a gaussian distribution of the localization position , centered around the initial mean position @xmath350 of particle 1 .",
    "the width @xmath351 of this gaussian distribution , which is independent from the initial state of the system , implies that there is a non - negligible probability to have a localization process within , say , @xmath352 away from the initial mean position .",
    "but now , let us focus on the case of a two - nucleon state . according to eq.([eq : xcmrel ] )",
    ", the mean value of the relative position can thus be increased by a localization process from @xmath353 up to approximately @xmath354 , which clearly indicates that @xmath355 can be no longer associated with a nucleon bound state . in the original grw model , i.e. , for @xmath185 , in this regime @xmath356",
    "would not be modified by the localization process , see eq.([eq : xcmrel ] ) .",
    "one could think that the inclusion of dissipation within the grw model necessarily leads to sudden internal transitions or even dissociations of nuclei , which would be of course an unacceptable feature of the model .",
    "this was actually the conclusion drawn in @xcite , where a similar example was considered @xcite .",
    "we think , however , that this is not the case and that the previous example is pointing out something different .",
    "one should in fact realize that the description of the localization mechanism has been carried out independently from the presence of a mutual interaction between the components of matter .",
    "when one says that the localization on a 2-particle system is described by the jump operator @xmath333 ( and by @xmath357 ) , this means that the localization process on each particle is the same whether or not they mutually interact .",
    "however , it is clear that such a characterization is in general not realistic and thus possibly leads to unphysical predictions . in the previous example",
    ", one concludes that the two nucleons are shifted apart much farther than the nuclei length scale by the localization mechanism , simply because the latter has been described without taking into account the effects of the interaction between the two nucleons , e.g. their binding energy . in order to estimate the average variation of the energy @xmath358 due to the localization process ,",
    "let us consider for simplicity the action of the localization operator on a one - particle gaussian state @xmath359 , see eq.([eq : xps ] ) .",
    "hence , under the assumption @xmath360 , the average exchanged energy @xmath358 is of the order of @xmath361 this value is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the energy needed for an internal transition in the case of a nucleon bound state , so that it should be clear how the localization processes of the model can not induce matter dissociation .",
    "once again , the analogy with decoherence turns out to be useful .",
    "if one considers the scattering of a tracer particle with a particle of its environment , the effects of the collision will be radically different whether or not the tracer particle is in a bound state .",
    "for instance , think about a gas of free tracer particles interacting with a background gas , in the low density regime : to a good extent , the collisions of each tracer particle with the environmental gas can be treated independently , so that the overall dynamics can be acquired by summing up the individual ones , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : megrwndiss ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the tracer particles are in a bound state , their interaction hamiltonian will combine with the interaction hamiltonian between each of them and the environmental particles , thus modifying the scattering processes .",
    "more in general , consider the derivation of a master equation for an @xmath62-particle open system starting from the @xmath131-particle master equation , but including a mutual interaction between the @xmath62 particles during the interaction with the environment .",
    "usually , the proper master equation can not be obtained by simply adding the mutual interaction hamiltonian to the hamiltonian term and summing up the @xmath131-particle lindblad equations , but the lindblad operators should be modified , as well .",
    "actually , in general one can not even expect to obtain a lindblad master equation for the single particles , not to mention the center of mass of the @xmath62-particle system .",
    "a non - markovian description of these dynamics will likely come into play @xcite .",
    "for the interested readers , in @xcite a microscopic derivation of the master equation of two interacting qubits in a common environment is given .",
    "this work highlights in a clear way how the mutual interaction between the two qubits modifies significantly the resulting lindblad structure , influencing , e.g. , the populations dynamics , as well as the fluorescence spectrum .",
    "summarizing , the usual description of the amplification mechanism relies on the idea that the noise acts on each constituent without being influenced by the presence of the others .",
    "however , in general this can not be taken for granted a priori .",
    "of course , this does not mean that a more realistic description of the @xmath62-particle system is incompatible with the amplification mechanism .",
    "on the contrary , we think that such a description will help to clarify to what extent and how the action of the noise induces the localization of the center of mass on more complex systems .",
    "this collective property of an @xmath62-particle system seems to be more motivated if the effects of the noise on the different components are correlated .",
    "indeed , a limited , but consistent way to take into account the mutual interaction between the constituents of the system is just obtained by dealing with a rigid body .",
    "the details of the internal dynamics are neglected , but each particle is considered as a component of a single @xmath62-particle bound system . the action of the noise on each constituent is turned directly into the corresponding action on the center of mass : the overall effect of the noise is correctly described by the sum of the action on each constituent , so that the results of the previous paragraph are in this case justified .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the grw model @xcite in order to avoid the infinite growth of the energy of the system .",
    "we have introduced new jump operators , while leaving the other defining features of the model unchanged .",
    "the jump operators correspond to the fourier transform of the lindblad operators of a model for collisional decoherence @xcite and depend on the momentum operator of the system .",
    "hence , they induce a dissipative evolution , which leads to a damping of the momentum , as well as to a finite asymptotic value of the energy . the inclusion of a dissipative mechanism within the collapse model has called for the definition of a new parameter , which is directly linked to the temperature @xmath0 of the noise .",
    "the original grw model is retrieved in the high temperature limit @xmath1 .",
    "we have proved that the collapse model can be formulated equivalently by means of a proper stochastic differential equation , defined in terms of a random field made up of one counting process for each point of space .",
    "the stochastic differential equation fully determines the possible trajectories in the hilbert space of the system . by focusing on the case of gaussian initial states",
    ", we have investigated the main features of these trajectories , showing in particular the occurrence of the position and momentum localization .",
    "the latter clarifies that the energy divergence in the original grw model has to be traced back to fluctuations in momentum , rather than to an unlimited increase of the momentum variance .",
    "as long as a rigid body is taken into account , the amplification mechanism still holds , so that the center of mass of a macroscopic system is localized on very short time scales and behaves for all the practical purposes according to classical mechanics . as usual , this has been shown by considering a master equation for the center of mass which is given by the sum of the one - particle master equations and taking the partial trace over the relative degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , we have also argued that a more general and realistic analysis of the @xmath62-particle system s evolution should be given if the interaction between the components of the system can affect the action of the noise .",
    "our results provide an important step toward the establishment of a realistic jump collapse model , which generalizes the original grw proposal . indeed , important advances are still to be made . a promising possibility to recover",
    "entirely the principle of the energy conservation is to consider the noise as a real physical field influenced by the presence of the system : the energy variations of the latter could be then explained in terms of an energy exchange with the noise .",
    "let us emphasize how this approach could be put forward by associating the random field to the physical field , as proposed for the continuous - time collapse models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , also in this paper we have assumed the hypothesis of a white noise : this greatly simplifies the characterization of the model and can provide a satisfactory description of the interaction between the system and the noise in certain regimes .",
    "however , there is no reason to exclude a priori the general case of a colored noise , such that , e.g. , the time distribution of the localization events is no longer memoryless .    finally , the inclusion of dissipation has allowed us to avoid the energy divergence also in the csl model @xcite , by properly modifying the corresponding stochastic differential equation in the fock space associated with the system , and to investigate the overheating problem in the disi - penrose model @xcite .",

    "<S> remarkably , even in the presence of a low temperature noise , the collapse model is effective . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the new jump operators still localizes the wavefunction and the relevance of the localization increases with the size of the system , according to the so - called amplification mechanism , which guarantees a unified description of the evolution of microscopic and macroscopic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the features of our model , at the level of both the trajectories in the hilbert space and the master equation for the average state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that the dissipative ghirardi - rimini - weber model , as well as the original one , can be fully characterized in a compact way by means of a proper stochastic differential equation . </S>"
