    "in stable matching problems , the aim is to match agents in a stable manner to objects or to other agents , keeping in view the preference of the agents involved .",
    "these problems have significant applications in matching residents to hospitals , students to schools , etc . and have received tremendous interest in the mathematical economics , computer science and operations research communities  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "informally , a matching is deemed ` stable ' if the agents do not have an incentive to deviate to achieve a better matching for themselves . in the matching theory literature ,",
    "the predominant notion of stability is indeed the core in which no pair of agents prefer to be matched to each other than remain in their current matching . _",
    "core stability _",
    "( also simply called stability ) has been extensively investigated in the context of the _ stable marriage ( sm ) _",
    "problem  @xcite and _ stable roommate ( sr ) _ problem  @xcite which are two of the most fundamental settings in matching theory .",
    "a comprehensive survey of the stable marriage and roommate problems is present in @xcite .",
    "we formulate the stable marriage and stable roommate settings as _ marriage games _ and _ roommate games_. both of these games are basic subclasses of _ hedonic coalition formation games _ in which an agent s preference of a partition only depends on the coalition ( of arbitrary size ) he is a member of and not on how the remaining agents are grouped  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of course , in the roommate and marriage games , feasible partitions simply correspond to matchings because each coalition is of size at most two .",
    "the main focus in hedonic games has been on different natural notions of stability of partitions .",
    "the stability concepts include individual - based stability concepts ( _ nash stability ( ns ) _ , _ individual stability ( is ) _ , and _ contractual individual stability ( cis ) _ ) and group - based stability concepts ( _ core ( c ) _ and _ strict core ( sc ) _ )  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "another individual - based stability concept is _ contractual nash stability ( cns ) _ which is stronger than cis and is defined in an analogous way to is  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we characterize the complexity of checking existence of and computing individual - based stable outcomes in marriage and roommate games .",
    "a number of existence results are also presented .",
    "our results shed further light on the dynamics of stability concepts like nash stability in fundamental settings such as marriage games .",
    "there are a number of reasons why individual - based stability in matching models may be of interest .",
    "individual - based stability applies in situations when forming arbitrary new coalitions may be ` _ _ costly or may require complex coordination among the players__'@xcite . furthermore , ` _",
    "_ if information on the preferences of other players is scarce [ @xmath0 , then considering the actions of individual players only may be quite compelling__'@xcite .",
    "since marriage games and roommate games may not admit a strict core stable and core stable matching respectively  @xcite , it makes sense to examine weaker stability notions such as is .",
    "is may also apply to other matching models . for e.g. , in hospital - resident",
    "matching , the hospital may not deviate with a resident and may accept any acceptable candidate ( with a minimum level of competency ) .    since marriage and roommate games are two of the most fundamental classes of hedonic games , our results have bearing on the coalition formation literature .",
    "in fact , one of our key computational results for marriage games also carries over to different classes of hedonic games for which individual - based stability has already been of much interest .",
    "finally , we point out that marriage and roommate settings are also one of the most basic models in network formation which further motivates our study .",
    "the complexity of computing partitions which are nash stable or individual stable has previously been examined for some classes of hedonic games such as additively separable hedonic games  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hedonic games represented by individually rational lists of coalitions ( rirlc )  @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced cns and showed that a cns partition is guaranteed for separable hedonic games satisfying weak mutuality .",
    "@xcite used restrictions on acceptable coalitions to characterize classes of hedonic coalition formation games with strict preference for which nash stable and individual stable partitions are guaranteed to exist .    for the roommate and marriage settings ,",
    "there has been considerable work on the _ stable marriage ( sm ) _ problem and _ stable roommate ( sr ) _ problem .",
    "stability in this regard is mostly _ core stability _ ( also simply called stability ) . in the stable marriage ( sm ) problem , the set of agents is partitioned into men and women ; men and women express strict preferences over all their counterparts ; and the aim is to find a stable matching in which men and women are matched to each other .",
    "the stable roommate problem ( sr ) is the unisex generalization of the stable roommate problem in which roommates are paired with each other in a stable matching  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , variants of the problems sm and sr have been examined : i ) smi and rmi  stable marriage and stable roommate problems with _",
    "incomplete _ preference preference lists thereby signifying that the agents not in a preference list of an agent are unacceptable to the agent ; ii ) smt and rmt  cases which allow ties / indifferences in the preference ; iii ) and finally smti and rmti  cases which allow both ties and incomplete lists",
    ". the reader may refer to table  [ table : rg - mg - complexity3 ] which summarizes the complexity results in the literature concerning stable matchings where the stability concept concerns deviation by groups or pairs of players .",
    "we will cover all the stable marriage and stable roommate settings mentioned above but instead of considering core stability , we will consider individual - based stability concepts .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite modeled uncoordinated marriage games and roommate games with strict preferences via a normal form game in which the pure nash equilibria of the normal form game coincide with core stable matchings",
