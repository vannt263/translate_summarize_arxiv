    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) has long been one of the cornerstones of statistical observational cosmology . as the distribution of galaxies as a function of luminosity",
    "is closely related both to the halo mass function predicted by structure formation models and to the astrophysical mechanisms governing star formation , the lf provides a fundamental test for models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the low - redshift lf has also been extensively studied ( see @xcite for a review ) , and some convergence has been reached on its general shape at the bright end . in the famous parametrization by @xcite , a faint - end power - law slope of @xmath4 is the consensus value .",
    "the characteristic bright - end absolute magnitude @xmath5 is dependent on the magnitude system and filter used , but the determination by @xcite sets it at @xmath6 in the @xmath7-band at z=0.1 ( adjusted for @xmath8 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the lf remains a field of ongoing study as modern instrumentation allows us to survey increasingly fainter galaxies .",
    "one aspect that has received great attention is the evolution of the lf with redshift , as this provides a much more stringent test of galaxy evolution models than the single data point that the local lf offers us .",
    "several groups have studied the lf to limits of @xmath9 @xcite or even higher , up to and beyond @xmath10 @xcite , and have found evidence for evolution .",
    "broadly speaking , early - type galaxies show a marked number density evolution with redshift , while late - type galaxies exhibit a luminosity evolution .",
    "but another frontier in our exploration of the lf lies at low redshifts and very faint absolute magnitudes .",
    "traditionally , the deepest probes of the lf come from studies of galaxy clusters . providing a sample of hundreds of galaxies at the same distances ,",
    "clusters offer an opportunity to determine lfs simply by counting galaxies and then applying corrections for sample contamination by unrelated background galaxies .",
    "this method has been criticized by @xcite and shown to potentially produce artificially steepened faint - end slopes for optically - selected clusters @xcite due to the fact that optical selection favors clusters with a higher - than - average density of background galaxies . however , since it eliminates the need for spectroscopic observations to determine the exact distance of each galaxy , this method has nonetheless been widely applied and has probed the lf of nearby clusters to spectacular depths @xcite .",
    "frequently , lfs calculated in this way show an upturn in the lf , setting in several magnitudes below the characteristic bright - end magnitude m@xmath11 , from a slope of @xmath4 to a much steeper slope of @xmath12 .",
    "more recently , a similar upturn has also been claimed by @xcite based on applying the background subtraction technique to clusters in the sdss .",
    "however , for a sample of clusters at @xmath13 , this has also recently been debated by @xcite , who are also working with statistical background subtraction , but find no evidence for an upturn in the cluster lf .",
    "furthermore , @xcite , working with a spectroscopic sample , find that the lfs of the virgo cluster and abell 2199 can be represented by single schechter functions consistent with the canonical values of @xmath14 in the range of @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and attribute the discrepancy from other studies to the use of statistical background subtraction without spectroscopic membership confirmation in the earlier work . in principle , an upturn is not implausible .",
    "it is known that galaxies with different morphologies or spectral types have very different schechter functions ; for example , the lf of late - type galaxies is generally very steep , while that of early - type galaxies is shallower .",
    "if both are extrapolated to faint magnitudes and then co - added , a faint - end upturn can be reproduced qualitatively @xcite , provided that the normalization of the late - type lf is still high enough in these dense environments in order for it to dominate the overall lf at some point .",
    "some surveys of nearby groups and clusters have also reported a `` dip '' in the lf at intermediate magnitudes @xcite , which could also be an indication of a bimodality that would be revealed as the superposition of a shallow and a very steep schechter function in a sufficiently deep and large survey .",
    "however , the fact that spectroscopic surveys of the field or clusters have not yet unambiguously verified this result ( because of their generally shallower depth ) makes this observation controversial .",
    "it would be extremely important to know if this upturn is real and if it is specific to cluster environments ( and thus an indicator of environment - specific processes generating large numbers of dwarf galaxies ) or rather a universal feature of the lf .",
    "current cold - dark - matter cosmologies surmise that galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos , and the low - mass end of the halo mass function is thought to be quite steep , with a power - law slope of @xmath17 .",
    "this is in marked contrast with the lf of field galaxies in the local universe , which exhibits a fairly flat faint - end slope of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , the field lf is well - established from spectroscopic surveys only to intermediate magnitudes of @xmath18 .",
    "also , studies of the local lf in the only environment where we can probe its extreme faint end directly , the local group and the nearest of galaxy groups beyond it , prefer a flat faint end slope all the way down to the extreme dwarf regime of @xmath19 @xcite or suggest at most a moderately steep slope @xcite ; these studies , however , suffer from being able to access only a very small cosmic volume .",
    "although new local group members continue to be found up to the present day @xcite , it is unlikely that they will change the census substantially at any but the very faintest luminosities , substantially fainter than the limit at which the steep faint - end upturn in clusters has been claimed to appear . mechanisms suppressing the formation of galaxies in such low - mass halos @xcite may explain the small number of observable dwarf galaxies at low luminosities , but it is unclear how such mechanisms would account for the presence of a large dwarf galaxy population in clusters .    a tentative suggestion of an upturn in the faint end of the field lf was found by @xcite , who detected a steepening of the slope to @xmath20 at intermediate luminosities , but speculated that inclusion of low - surface brightness galaxies undetectable by the sdss might modify this value to @xmath21 or even steeper . apart from this work , the aforementioned studies of the lf in clusters provide the only suggestion of a steeper faint - end slope so far , but these are questionable due to their samples lacking spectroscopic confirmation and therefore being susceptible to background contamination .",
    "the frontier in exploring the lf at higher redshift and to fainter absolute magnitudes therefore lies in pushing the flux sensitivity of samples towards fainter and more distant objects .",
    "however , at such low fluxes , spectroscopic redshift determination remains extremely time - consuming and has a high failure rate , precluding its application to large samples . as an alternative approach , photometric redshifts are increasingly being substituted for spectroscopic redshifts even in the study of lfs @xcite .",
    "however , it is well - known that photometric redshifts are not an equivalent substitute for spectroscopic redshifts ; their accuracy is typically of the order of @xmath22 even in the best cases , and frequently worse than that , leading to the galaxy distribution being smeared out in luminosity and distance .",
    "in addition , they suffer from catastrophic failures ; galaxies of very different spectral types and at different redshifts can have similar colors , leading to large errors in their recovered photometric redshift that do not obey gaussian errors .",
    "even purely gaussian errors in the photometry therefore inevitably propagate into non - gaussian errors in the photometric redshift , and samples selected by photometric redshifts are inevitably contaminated by galaxies from galaxy populations outside these selection limits .",
    "in addition , the distribution of these errors varies from galaxy to galaxy , depending on its spectral properties , true redshift , and magnitude .",
    "for all these reasons , the recovered photometric redshifts and , by extension , lfs , are always dependent on ( explicit or implicit ) prior assumptions about the lfs of all galaxy populations at all redshifts  assumptions which , except in the case of very careful analyses , are often neglected , or in conflict with the recovered results .    unfortunately , luminosity function algorithms have adapted only poorly to this situation .",
    "the algorithms applied to the problem of recovering lfs from photometric - only samples are based on the same methods used twenty years ago for the recovery of lfs from samples with known spectroscopic redshifts . in the simplest procedure , photometric redshifts are simply substituted for spectroscopic redshifts , and , assuming that the errors in the photometric redshifts are sufficiently understood , monte carlo simulations can be used to estimate whether a serious bias has been introduced into the recovered lf parameters .",
    "this approach can be successful , especially at high redshift , where a given uncertainty @xmath23 in the photometric redshift translates into only a relatively minor uncertainty in the absolute magnitude .",
    "an example of a successful application of this procedure to the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( `` musyc '' ) @xcite ( http://www.astro.yale.edu/musyc ) is found in @xcite .",
    "however , at low redshift , as has been demonstrated in the past @xcite , the problems associated with the redshift uncertainties are generally larger : a redshift uncertainty @xmath24 , typical for photometric redshift determinations , translates into a significant uncertainty in absolute magnitude .",
    "correspondingly high - quality multi - band photometric data is needed to constrain the redshifts well @xcite , but obtaining such extensive datasets is not always practical .",
    "there have been suggestions in the literature for adjustments to the lf calculation that take into account the photometric uncertainties and the resulting uncertainties in the redshift .",
    "these have either employed monte carlo methods @xcite or incorporated the photo - z uncertainties analytically into the procedure used for recovering the lf @xcite .",
    "however , both methods are based on the idea of evaluating a redshift probability distribution that is centered on the best - fit recovered photometric redshift , and _ not centered on the true redshift_. the net effect is that the galaxy distribution is subjected to a further convolution with the redshift error function , instead of a deconvolution .",
    "the idea behind the _ photometric maximum likelihood _ method ( hereinafter : pml ) , which we introduce in this paper , is therefore to abandon the concept of assigning individual luminosities and redshifts to individual galaxies , since neither are known in non - spectroscopic surveys .",
    "instead , we constrain the lf by requiring it to reproduce the distribution of galaxies in a parameter space consisting of quantities that are known exactly : the observed fluxes in multiple filter bands .",
    "we refer to this parameter space , wherein observer - frame fluxes in multiple filter bands are used as the coordinates , as _ photometric space_. this algorithm achieves a true deconvolution of the observed galaxy distribution into its constituent galaxy luminosity functions , and it allows for a self - consistent solution by avoiding priors that the recovered photometric redshifts and luminosity distributions in photometric surveys normally depend on .",
    "in this paper , we present the first application of the pml to a data set that is an ideal test case for this algorithm , the musyc survey @xcite .",
    "musyc is a deep square degree survey ( divided into four separate fields ) , comprising some @xmath25 galaxies .",
    "photometric data in a multitude of optical and nir filter bands exist . for the present study",
    ", we use one of the four musyc fields , the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) , observed in eight filter bands : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the large number of filter bands make this survey very suitable to photometric redshift techniques as well as to the pml .",
    "the limiting depth of @xmath34 mag means that we can probe the lf to extremely faint limits ; the relatively wide area , compared to other pencil - beam surveys , guarantees that even the bright end will still be fairly well - sampled at all but the smallest redshifts . with a sample cut at @xmath35 , the pml permits us to constrain the field galaxy lf to a limit as faint as @xmath36 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec_data ] , we briefly discuss the data set , the musyc survey . in ",
    "[ sec_method ] , we present our lf algorithm the _ photometric maximum likelihood _ method and test it using a mock catalogue . in  [ sec_results ] , we present an application of our method to musyc by calculating luminosity function parameters , split up by spectral type , from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "musyc is designed to provide a fair sample of the universe for the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central black holes .",
    "the core of the survey is a deep imaging campaign in optical and near - infrared passbands of four carefully selected 30@xmath3930@xmath40 fields .",
    "musyc is one of few surveys to offer its combination of depth and total area , for additional coverage at x - ray , uv- , mid - infrared , and far - infrared wavelengths , and for providing the @xmath41 photometry needed for high - quality photometric redshifts over a square degree of sky ( availability of nir data varies from field to field ) .",
    "the primary goal is to study the properties and interrelations of galaxies at a single epoch corresponding to redshift @xmath42 , but the favorable combination of depth , area , and passband coverage makes it suitable for studies of the general galaxy population over a wide range of redshifts as well as for galactic astronomy @xcite .",
    "imaging data for three of the four musyc fields was obtained with mosaic ii on the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile . for the fourth field , the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) , which we analyze in the present paper , our @xmath43 imaging results from combining public images taken with the eso 2.2 m and wfi by the eso deep public survey and combo-17 teams @xcite .",
    "our @xmath44 imaging was taken with the ctio 4 m and mosaic ii .",
    "our @xmath45 images of the e - cdfs were obtained with the ctio 4 m and ispi .",
    "photometric coverage of the four musyc fields is not perfectly homogeneous . for the present study ,",
    "we have thus chosen to focus on one of the four musyc fields , namely the e - cdfs , which offers the deepest optical imaging ; furthermore , in contrast to the other musyc fields at the time of this writing , the optically selected photometric catalogue with @xmath46 photometry has been matched to nir catalogues in @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the large number of spectroscopic redshifts available in the literature also enable us to check the quality of our models by estimating photometric redshifts .",
    "this field is centered on @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the data that we use for this analysis are drawn from a catalogue selected by the combined @xmath27- , @xmath28- , and @xmath29-band flux , and complemented by photometry in the @xmath32- and @xmath33-bands .",
    "the catalogues of @xmath32- and @xmath33-band photometric data for the @xmath49-selected detections have not been published , but separate , @xmath33-band - selected catalogues of this field based on the same imaging material comprising the nir bands are already public and described in @xcite .",
    "the full catalog of the musyc e - cdfs contains 84410 objects . at the depth of musyc , the detections consist primarily of galaxies , but the catalog also contains point sources ( stars and qsos ) , which we remove based on morphological criteria , using the star / galaxy classifier ( @xmath50 ) provided by the source extractor software @xcite , which was used in the construction of the detection catalog . to calibrate the threshold value of @xmath50",
    ", we compare its distribution to the position of a detection in the @xmath51-@xmath52 parameter space . in such a parameter space , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sg ] , point sources populate an approximately horizontal band . experimentally , we find that @xmath53 separates the two populations with minimal overlap .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_sg ] by marking all objects with @xmath54 with asterisks in the left panel , and all other objects with dots in the right panel .",
    "this is a rather high threshold , compared to values adopted in the literature in similar efforts ( i.e. , @xmath55 , @xcite ; @xmath56 , @xcite ; @xmath57 , @xcite ) , and it is possible that our s / g threshold fails to exclude scattered light from saturated stars or close double star systems . to estimate",

    "point sources tend to populate a horizontal branch in this diagram , and extended sources an extended cloud on the right side , but the two overlap for faint magnitudes . in the left panel , objects with the star / galaxy class @xmath54 are marked , in the right panel objects with @xmath59 .",
    "this limit decomposes the two populations with minimal overlap ; we therefore accept objects with @xmath59 as galaxies . , width=317 ]    for the calculation of the lf from a flux - limited sample , a thorough understanding of the selection function is imperative .",
    "the optical musyc source catalogs are detected by sextractor in the combined @xmath27- , @xmath28- , and @xmath29-band image , as described in @xcite .",
    "the limiting magnitude for the e - cdfs field is @xmath60 mag ( in the ab magnitude system , which is used throughout this paper ) . for the present paper ,",
    "we apply an additional cut in just a single filter band , the @xmath29-band , to create our subsample . at @xmath61 mag ,",
    "corresponding to a flux limit of @xmath62 @xmath63jy , which is the limit adopted for our analysis , the sample is complete in @xmath49 .",
    "objects with sextractor warning flags 1 , 2 ( presence of a close neighbour object possibly affecting the photometry ; necessity of deblending ) are left in the catalog ; objects with higher warning flags are removed without statistical compensation .    for our analysis",
    ", we use `` corrected aperture magnitudes '' @xcite , which yield an estimate of the total flux , but offer good s / n for compact sources .",
    "an exception are very extended objects ( with a half - light radius in the @xmath49-image of 1 arcsec or more ) , for which we substitute the `` auto '' photometric measurement provided by sextractor . in addition , we have carried out modifications to the published musyc photometry , as described in appendix [ sec_photcorr ] , to adjust the photometric zero points and ensure that the photometric errors conform to a gaussian distribution .",
    "these corrections have significantly improved the quality of the recovered photometric redshifts in comparison to a subsample of galaxies with redshift estimates from the literature , spanning a broad range of redshifts and sed types , and have brought the uncertainty distribution in line with the assumptions made in our algorithm .",
    "the most common type of lf algorithms for magnitude - limited samples of field galaxies are maximum likelihood algorithms .",
    "these algorithms are based on the principle of calculating a predicted distribution of galaxies from a trial lf , comparing it to the observed distribution , determining the likelihood of the trial lf , and then modifying the latter until the likelihood has been maximized .",
    "traditionally , the distributions that are being compared are the distributions over luminosity @xcite , sometimes over luminosity plus additional parameters that the lf could depend on , such as spectral type @xcite , morphology @xcite , or redshift @xcite itself .    in photometric surveys , neither spectral type , nor redshift , nor luminosity are known exactly .",
    "nonetheless , past attempts to calculate the galaxy lf from photometric surveys have sought to reconcile the data with the algorithm by simply substituting photometric redshifts for spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "this can potentially cause several severe problems :    * _ random errors _ in the photometric redshifts `` blur '' the recovered distances and absolute magnitudes .",
    "this introduces systematic biases in the recovered lf , as can be illustrated by a _",
    "gedankenexperiment _ : a typical lf is well - approximated by a power law at the faint end and has a well - defined exponential downturn at the bright end . if random errors exist in the galaxy redshift , the absolute magnitude estimates of all sample galaxies will be convolved with an error function , which `` blurs '' the shape of the lf and moves the bright - end `` knee '' to brighter luminosities .",
    "this can be minimized by operating at high redshift ( where the impact of redshift uncertainties on the absolute magnitude is smaller ) and , of course , with high - quality multi - band photometric data . * _ systematic errors and catastrophic failures _ in the photometric redshifts may severely impact the recovered lf .",
    "for example , systematic offsets between the photometric redshifts and the true redshift ( a common occurrence resulting from errors in the photometric calibration ) will directly introduce shifts in the recovered absolute magnitudes .",
    "catastrophic failures ( i.e. , photometric redshifts significantly and systematically different from the true redshifts ) can have a devastating impact ; for example , a small number of nearby , bright galaxies mistakenly fitted as high - redshift galaxies may easily dominate the bright end of the lf recovered at high redshift .",
    "it is important to note that such catastrophic failures can result simply from the propagation of gaussian errors of the photometry into the photo - z determination .",
    "this means that modeling photometric redshift uncertainties as gaussians is not legitimate even for perfectly - calibrated photometry . *",
    "_ sample contamination _ is common .",
    "lf determinations are usually carried out for subsamples of galaxies in a confined redshift range and for selected sed types only .",
    "however , any subsample selected from photometric redshift data only will almost certainly be contaminated by galaxies at other redshifts and with a wide range of sed types , and incomplete with respect to galaxies that meet the selection criteria ( see for example @xcite , which argues that photometric redshifts from the combo-17 survey @xcite suffer from contamination at @xmath64 due to the lack of nir photometry ) . aggravating this problem , the amount of contamination is , of course , dependent on the lf of the contaminant population .",
    "therefore , even if some attempt is made to minimize the contamination ( e.g. , by introducing an lf prior into the photo - z calculation ) , the resulting lf is dependent on the lfs of all other galaxy populations at other redshifts .",
    "various procedures have been suggested for propagating the inherent uncertainties from photometric redshifts into the lf .",
    "a simple strategy , proposed by @xcite , is to carry out a monte carlo simulation , drawing redshifts for each galaxy at random from the probability distribution indicated by the photo - z algorithm .",
    "however , the fallacy in this approach is that the monte carlo redshifts are drawn from a probability distribution that is centered on the best - fit photo - z , and _ not on the true redshift_. while this approach does indeed propagate the photo - z uncertainties into the final solution , it does not correct the systematic biases in the photo - z recovery ; on the contrary , drawing galaxies from a photo - z probability distributions around photo - zs that are already affected by these uncertainties will convolve the solution even more , instead of deconvolving it , and may even exacerbate the systematic errors .",
    "a slightly different approach is taken by @xcite , who incorporate the photo - z probability distribution into the likelihood function itself .",
    "however , inspection of their _ ansatz _ shows that the effect is , in fact , again a further convolution of the galaxy distribution , rather than a deconvolution , equivalent to the monte - carlo approach ( it is equivalent to replacing each sample galaxy with a sum of `` fractional '' galaxies with a range of redshifts ) ; it is thus a more elegant approach suffering from the same problem : the redshift probability distribution is evaluated around a redshift that is not the true redshift .",
    "a mathematically much more consistent method that addresses many of the criticisms above has been suggested more recently by @xcite : the recovered photometric redshift is treated as a quasi - observable distinct from the true redshift , and reproducing its distribution is an additional requirement imposed on the lf algorithm .",
    "this approach appears theoretically sound ; however , it stops short of replacing the photometric redshift with a different , and easier - to - handle , observable , as we propose here .",
    "this raises two practical problems for the application : 1 ) the algorithm is still based on the concept of a best - fit photo - z .",
    "the procedure of first calculating a best - fit photo - z and then feeding it as input into an lf algorithm always carries with it a loss of information that is contained in the full photometric vector .",
    "2 ) the error function of the photometric redshift must be modeled well , which is challenging , as it is a function of many parameters , including the observed flux and true sed of a galaxy .",
    "the shape of the photometric redshift probability distribution function varies with the sed , redshift , and apparent magnitude of the galaxy in question ( e.g. , late - type galaxies are much more difficult to constrain than early - type galaxies ) , and may not even generally be assumed to be gaussian either , but may in some cases exhibit a complex shape with secondary maxima .",
    "an additional issue that has not been addressed by conventional lf algorithms ( but appears to be accounted for by @xcite ) is that the _ probability distribution _ of photometric redshift is itself dependent on implicit or explicit prior assumptions about the lf of galaxies at any redshift .",
    "photometric redshifts are therefore dependent on prior assumptions about the redshift distribution of galaxies ( i.e. , the lf of galaxies of all possible spectral types throughout cosmic history ) . in photometric redshift determinations , this dependence is often neglected , and redshifts are calculated simply as best - fit estimates , regardless of the redshift or template type that yields the fit .",
    "note , however , that even this approach to photo - z determination carries an implicit and unjustified prior , namely , that the prior probability distribution , which depends on the cosmic volume and the lf , is flat with redshift .",
    "a more promising approach is bayesian redshift determination @xcite , which applies priors ( usually in the form of luminosity function priors ) to select the most probable photometric redshift .",
    "however , while at least the shape of the bright end of the lf is reasonably well known , priors about the faint end and the high - redshift lf are highly uncertain . furthermore , upon obtaining a new solution for the lf at any redshift , the priors should be modified to accommodate this new information , and the process iterated , so as to avoid a contradiction between the lf result and the assumed prior .",
    "if this is not done , a logical inconsistency between the prior applied to the photo - z calculation and the resulting lf will generally result .",
    "* instead of a deconvolution , they have often carried out a further convolution of the data by applying an assumed error function to the observed data .",
    "a proper deconvolution requires that the error function be applied to a model , and the resulting distribution be compared to the observed data . *",
    "they have evaluated the predicted and observed galaxy distributions in a parameter space consisting of redshift and derived variables , which are not actual observables , but are affected by very complex error functions , which prohibit a direct deconvolution . in such cases , the comparison is more easily carried out in a parameter space consisting of direct observables , allowing us to convolve a predicted data set with the known error function instead . * they have used photometric redshifts and have consequently been forced to evaluate their error functions .",
    "photometric redshifts have very complicated error functions that are usually neither gaussian nor uniform , but instead feature secondary maxima and are dependent on magnitude and sed type . but",
    "the calculation of lfs does not require knowledge of the redshift of individual galaxies .",
    "we therefore suggest to eliminate the photometric redshift from the consideration and focus on direct observables , i.e. , the observed fluxes , which have a much simpler error function . *",
    "they have often failed to take into account the dependence of the photometric redshift on prior assumptions about the lf at all redshifts .",
    "a proper determination of the lf must acknowledge this dependence and ideally provide a self - consistent solution that is not dependent on external priors , but constrained only by the data .",
    "the problems described above arise from the attempt to use established lf algorithms , which were originally developed for samples for which the exact redshifts and , by extension , absolute magnitudes , are known , in a context that they were not constructed for , namely , photometric - only galaxy surveys .",
    "our _ photometric maximum likelihood _",
    "method adopts the basic principle of maximum likelihood algorithms : from a trial lf , the galaxy distribution in a certain parameter space ( e.g. , absolute magnitude ) is predicted , and the probability for drawing the observed sample from this distribution ( i.e. , the likelihood of the trial lf ) is then calculated .",
    "the trial lf is then adjusted to optimize this likelihood .",
    "however , the _ photometric maximum likelihood _ algorithm differs from established algorithms by comparing the observed and predicted galaxy distributions in a parameter space consisting only of direct observables , namely , the observed photometric fluxes in all available filter bands .",
    "we refer to this parameter space as _",
    "photometric space_. this addresses the problems described above .    *",
    "the pml is able to carry out a proper deconvolution of the observed photometric data : it applies an error function to the expectation values for the photometric fluxes in each filter band and compares the resulting distribution to the observed data .",
    "* by evaluating the galaxy distribution as a function of observed fluxes , instead of photometric redshifts , the pml avoids the unnecessary loss of information that is usually incurred when converting the full information of a multi - band photometric observation into a single photometric redshift .",
    "this also offers the decisive benefit that photometric errors in individual filter bands are much easier to model than those of photometric redshifts . *",
    "the algorithm considers the contributions of all lfs at all redshifts to the distribution in photometric space simultaneously , and therefore finds a self - consistent solution for each lf that is ( ideally ) not dependent on implicit or explicit external luminosity priors .",
    "our algorithm , by design , naturally accounts for the dependence of the lf on redshift and sed type .",
    "an important aspect is the fact that , when evaluating the distribution of galaxies in photometric space , in principle , any galaxy population at any redshift can contribute to the galaxy counts at a given point in photometric space .",
    "it is not possible to clearly separate samples by sed type and redshift .",
    "this implies that the likelihood found by the pml algorithm is calculated as a likelihood for all lfs of all galaxy populations throughout cosmic history .",
    "this appears at first as a drawback , greatly enlarging the number of free parameters involved in the problem .",
    "however , as has been pointed out above , in the conventional approach , it is not strictly possible to clearly separate a sample by redshift and sed type either .",
    "any association of an individual galaxy to a given redshift and sed type is only a statistical one , and under proper bayesian consideration , the probability for any such association is dependent on the prior assumptions about the lfs of all galaxy populations that a galaxy could in principle have been drawn from .",
    "whereas this dependence usually goes unacknowledged , it is made explicit in the pml , and the problem of introducing external priors is ( in an ideal case ) eliminated by solving for all contributing lfs simultaneously .",
    "the derivation of a maximum likelihood algorithm starts with the definition of the likelihood function , i.e. , the probability that the observed data of a galaxy survey would have been obtained from a given trial lf .",
    "the specific likelihood function that we use is inspired by the approach of @xcite , which has also been used more recently by @xcite and @xcite for the determination of galaxy lfs , which uses a product of poisson probabilities to derive the survey probability .",
    "we imagine an @xmath65-dimensional flux space , the _ photometric space_. in this space , each dimension corresponds to one filter band in which a flux is measured , and each coordinate to a measured flux in the corresponding filter .",
    "each galaxy @xmath66 with measured photometry thus occupies a unique position @xmath67 that represents the observed flux in all @xmath65 filters .",
    "we now imagine this space to be subdivided into small cells [ @xmath68;@xmath69 that are chosen small enough that each cell contains either exactly 0 or 1 galaxies .",
    "we then define the likelihood function of the survey as the product of the poisson probabilities that each cell that contains a galaxy would contain exactly one object , and that each of the remaining cells would contain none , under the prior of a chosen luminosity function . in other words , @xmath70    here , @xmath71 is the expectation value of the number of galaxies in cell [ @xmath72;@xmath69 of photometric space .",
    "the index @xmath66 runs over all observed galaxies , while the index @xmath73 runs over all cells of flux space that are not occupied by a galaxy .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we apply this likelihood evaluation to the distribution of galaxies in photometric space , while the previous work makes use of the availability of full or partial spectroscopic coverage to evaluate the galaxy distribution as a function of luminosity and redshift .",
    "this distinction is the defining feature of the pml .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested that the proper statistical distribution to use is a binomial one , rather than the poisson distribution used in the _ ansatz _ of marshall et al .",
    "however , they acknowledge that , for surveys that sample only a small fraction of the total sky , which is certainly the case for musyc , poisson distributions are acceptable .    in our sample , we do not have the luxury of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "it is therefore necessary to introduce a mapping between the luminosity function parameters and photometric space .",
    "we assume that the photometric data points are distributed according to a gaussian distribution centered on the expectation value for a given absolute magnitude @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and redshift @xmath76 , and furthermore , that the photometric errors are independent in each filter .",
    "this expression integrates over all possible galaxy populations  at all redshifts , all absolute magnitudes , and all spectral types @xmath75  and evaluates their contributions to the galaxy density in photometric space at the flux position @xmath72 .",
    "the term @xmath79 is the differential comoving volume , and @xmath80 are the assumed parameters of the lf whose likelihood we wish to test .",
    "the fraction of galaxies with the physical parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath76 that contribute to the galaxy density at a point @xmath72 is determined via the probability term @xmath83  the @xmath84 probability density resulting from a comparison between the fluxes predicted for these parameters , and the observed fluxes ; this distribution is used here under the assumption that the errors in each filter band are uncorrelated with each other and that the photometric uncertainties in each band are gaussian .",
    "this probability term is our assumed photometric error function .",
    "the denominator is the product of the observed flux uncertainties and serves to normalize the probability distribution .",
    "we use the following definition of the dimensionless probability density : @xmath85 here , @xmath86 is the number of degrees of freedom ( in our case , the number of filters with valid photometry ) .",
    "we use the _ empirical _ measurement uncertainties @xmath88 of galaxy @xmath66 to define the @xmath84 statistic .",
    "this is a compromise .",
    "a more consistent approach would be to select uncertainties appropriate for the _ predicted _ fluxes of the galaxy in each filter band .",
    "however , this would require an error model reproducing accurate uncertainties in every filter band as a function of flux .",
    "as the photometric uncertainties are largely dictated by conditions other than luminosity alone ( such as the surface area of the galaxy ) , this would require additional assumptions that would weaken , rather than strengthen , our case .",
    "we believe that the substitution of the empirical uncertainties in this definition is a justifiable compromise .",
    "a notable point about this approach is that the absolute magnitude of an individual galaxy enters via the normalization of the sed in any desired rest - frame filter band ( which need not be identical to the filters used in the survey ) .",
    "the @xmath89-correction is therefore integrated into the algorithm implicitly , and the absolute magnitude for a given galaxy at a given redshift and sed is constrained by all available filter bands , rather than by a single band and a corresponding @xmath89-correction ; it is therefore usually quite precisely constrained .",
    "a caveat is that the accuracy of absolute magnitudes depends on the accuracy of the templates ; therefore , although the algorithm is in principle capable of calculating lfs in any desired rest - frame filter band , it is desirable that the luminosity in this filter band be well - constrained by the available photometry ( i.e. , we would distrust rest - frame lfs in filter bands at the extreme red or blue end of the survey coverage ) .    as eq .",
    "[ eq_lambda ] shows , the pml accounts intrinsically for the dependence of the lf on redshift , spectral type , and , if desired , other parameters of the lf .",
    "it also automatically accounts for the effect of photometric uncertainties on the recovered lf .",
    "most importantly , however , it combines the functionality of a photometric redshift algorithm with that of a lf algorithm via the probability term @xmath90 , which relates a given galaxy population to the galaxy distribution in photometric space .              here , the first term represents the likelihood of drawing the observed galaxies from the assumed input lfs , while the second term is simply the total predicted number of galaxies within the flux limits of the survey .",
    "the expression @xmath98 , the volume of one of our cells in photometric space , can be omitted , as it will only add a constant offset of @xmath99 .",
    "increasing the assumed space density of any galaxy population ( for example , by increasing the normalization of the lf ) will decrease the first term , reflecting the greater probability of drawing the observed galaxies from such an input lf , but it will also increase the second term , the total number of galaxies expected in the survey . the luminosity function that balances these terms by minimizing",
    "the function @xmath99 is the maximum likelihood lf .",
    "calculating @xmath100 in the second term requires an assumption regarding the width of the distribution , i.e. , the photometric errors of a hypothetical galaxy at a point @xmath68 in photometric space , in order to correctly represent the contributions of galaxy populations near the flux limit of the sample to the total number of observed galaxies .",
    "it should be set to a value typical of the survey under consideration ; we have experimentally found that the impact of this value on the recovered lfs is very minor .",
    "we set it to @xmath101 of the flux , which is characteristic of most objects near this flux limit .",
    "this value determines the fraction of galaxies whose observed fluxes scatter across the survey limit , and it will influence the solution only if the faint end of the lf is very steep , i.e. , if a much larger number of normally unobservable galaxies scatter above the survey limits due to photometric errors than vice versa .    despite our magnitude threshold of @xmath102 , there are galaxies in the catalogue that are consistent with zero flux in at least one other filter band . as a result ,",
    "the algorithm may associate them with extremely faint populations that would normally not be expected to contribute to galaxy counts at all , given our model seds and the nominal flux error of 25% .",
    "inclusion of such objects may prevent a full convergence of the lf solution , especially in parameters that are constrained by few other objects . to prevent this",
    ", we only evaluate contributions to @xmath103 from populations that yield a non - zero contribution to the total expectation value for the number of galaxies in the survey . in other words , we ignore potential contributions to the observed galaxy sample from populations that should , assuming reasonable seds and photometric errors , be outside the survey flux limits anyway .    the fact that no precise redshift information is available",
    "does imply that the pml shares a disadvantage with the traditional @xmath104 method : it requires certain assumptions about spatial homogeneity of the lf , violation of which may bias the results . in a non - spectroscopic sample , this is generally unavoidable , because photometric redshift uncertainties wipe out detailed information about large scale structure . to the extent that the photometric information permits it , the pml may constrain the lf in several independent redshift bins and thus reproduce gross features of the cosmic galaxy density fluctuation .      a number of possible parameterizations",
    "have been proposed in the literature to represent the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the classical representation is the schechter function @xcite , which describes the lf with a power - law faint end and an exponential cutoff at the bright end .",
    "it is characterized by three parameters : @xmath5 , the characteristic bright - end magnitude , @xmath14 , the faint - end slope , and @xmath105 , a normalization parameter :      as our method requires us to model the contributions from lfs of all galaxy populations at all redshifts to the observed galaxy distribution simultaneously , we follow @xcite in using an additional parameter @xmath107 to model evolution in the parameter @xmath5 : @xmath108 -m)(1+\\alpha ) } \\nonumber \\\\ \\qquad \\times exp(-10^{0.4(m^{*}_{0}-\\delta \\:log_{10}[(1+z)/(1+z_0)]-m ) } \\label{eq_evoschechter}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this equation is derived from eq .",
    "[ eq_schechter ] simply by substituting @xmath5 at with a redshift - dependent @xmath109 $ ] . here",
    ", @xmath110 is the characteristic bright - end magnitude evaluated at a fiducial redshift @xmath111 . to minimize covariances between @xmath112 and @xmath107",
    ", @xmath111 should be chosen as the redshift at which @xmath113 is best - constrained by the sample . in our case , we have experimentally found that , for both early and late - type galaxies , the @xmath112-@xmath107 covariance is minimized for @xmath114 .    for modeling the lf as a function of sed type and redshift , we assume that each sed template type is described by a schechter function with a constant @xmath14 , @xmath5 , and @xmath107",
    ". as photometric data can not resolve density fluctuation on arbitrarily small scales , we assume that the lf for a given sed type is constant in each of ten redshift bins that we divide the redshift range @xmath115 into . potential density fluctuations on scales similar to or larger than these bins can therefore by reproduced by the algorithm .",
    "the redshift bins , along with the approximate limiting absolute magnitudes for early and late type galaxies , are shown in table [ tab_redshiftbins ] .",
    "the divisions between redshift bins are motivated by the desire to apportion approximately equal numbers of observed galaxies to each bin .",
    "also , we have attempted to reflect the robustness of photometric redshift constraints in the choice of binning .",
    "although this model represents a compromise , the number of free parameters is still considerable .    finally , to provide a visual verification of whether the schechter function is indeed an adequate description of the overall shape of the lf",
    ", we provide a binned representation of the lf . here",
    "the free parameters are simply the averaged values of the lf in a number of discrete bins :      where @xmath117 if @xmath118 and @xmath119 otherwise .",
    "if evolution of the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath120 is suspected across the redshift range for which this representation is used , the interval limits @xmath121 can of course be taken to be relative to the evolving @xmath113 at a given redshift , and an additional redshift - dependent normalization constant can be introduced to take out any previously known redshift evolution of @xmath120 .",
    "this is the approach that we will be following in  [ sec_binnedlf ] ."
