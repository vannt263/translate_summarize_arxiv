    "wraps around the radio source .",
    "there are clear signs of interaction between the x - ray and radio emission including : ( 1 ) strong x - ray emission that matches the shape of the radio emission just south of the core ; ( 2 ) a faint rim of hard x - ray emission along the northern edge of the radio source ; and ( 3 ) deep cavities in the x - ray emission on both the east and west sides .",
    "we also find a compact x - ray component coincident with the radio and optical core ( see fig .  [ xband ] ) .    in order to gain insights to the nature of the nucleus",
    ", we have conducted a short , 3 hour , very long baseline array ( vlba ) observation of  at 5 ghz .",
    "we also present a radio continuum spectrum of the nucleus using the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "both the vla and vlba are operated by the nrao .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath3 = 70 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 so that 1  = 210 pc at the redshift of the centaurus cluster .",
    "vla observations of the radio source  were made on 2004 october 24 at 0.326 , 1.400 , 4.860 , 8.460 , 14.940 , 22.460 , and 43.3140 ghz in the `` a '' configuration .",
    "we also make use of previous vla observations at 4.8 and 8.3 ghz described in @xcite .",
    "details regarding all radio observations are given in table  1 .",
    "the source 3c286 was used as the primary flux density calibrator .",
    "phase calibration was derived from the nearby compact source j1316@xmath23338 except for the observations at 0.326 ghz which employed a more distant , but stronger calibrator at this frequency , j1154 - 3505 .",
    "these 0.326 ghz observations have been described by @xcite .",
    "due to poor atmospheric weather conditions at the vla on 2004 october 24 , phase transfer failed for the observations at 43 ghz . at this high frequency ,",
    "is too weak to self - calibrate and we were only able to obtain an upper limit of 37 mjy on the flux density of the nucleus .",
    "the data were reduced in aips ( astronomical image processing system ) following the standard procedures , and imaged with difmap . in fig .  [ spectrum ]",
    "we show a spectrum of the nucleus on 2004 oct 24 .",
    "these data are tabulated in table  2 .",
    "the resolution is proportional to frequency and varies from @xmath40.07  at 43 ghz to @xmath410  at 0.32 ghz .",
    "consequently , some lobe emission contaminates the spectrum of the nucleus at 1.4 ghz , and we can not estimate the nuclear flux density at 0.32 ghz .",
    "we find a powerlaw with slope , @xmath50.55 @xmath6 0.04 describes the nuclear spectrum well between 1.4 and 43 ghz .",
    "we define the spectral index , @xmath7 , as @xmath8 .",
    "the vlba observed  at 5.0 ghz on 2005 february 14 , with only 9 antennas since the vlba station at brewster , wa , is too far north to observe this southern source .",
    "a total of 32 mhz bandwidth was recorded in both right and left circular polarization using 2 bit sampling .",
    "the nearby ( 1.0@xmath9 ) source j1253 - 4059 was used for phase - referencing with a 1:1 minute cycle on source : calibrator .",
    "the more distant ( 5.1@xmath9 ) calibrator j1227 - 4436 was observed every 30 minutes to check on the quality of the phase referencing and gain calibration .",
    "unfortunately , this source was so distant that the phase - referencing did not succeed .",
    "the total time on  was 66 minutes .",
    "amplitude calibration was derived using measurements of the system temperatures and antenna gains at 4992 mhz .",
    "fringe - fitting was performed with the aips task fring on the strong calibrator 3c  279 . before the final application of the fringe - calibration ,",
    "was shifted by 136 mas west , and 308 mas south based on a preliminary measurement of its position from these observations .",
    "the best position of the nucleus , along with other radio properties , is summarized in table  3 .",
    "bandpass calibration was derived from the observation of 3c  279 .",
    "no linear polarization calibration was attempted for this short observing run .",
    "self - calibration with a 1 minute solution interval was used to further refine the calibration and remove some slow - changing atmospheric phase errors .    the final image at full resolution ( fig.[fullres ] )",
    "has an rms noise of 90 @xmath10jy / beam .",
    "the full resolution vlba image reveals a compact component with 9 mjy , and a bright inner jet of flux density 2.4 mjy at position angle @xmath2156 .",
    "a tapered image ( fig .  [ lowres ] ) shows that the jet is broad ( opening angle 18 ) and can be traced out over 120 mas in position angle @xmath2152 .",
    "the total flux density recovered in the vlba image is 29 mjy .",
    "this is 31% of the 94.4 mjy seen in the central 0.4  by the vla , suggesting that two thirds of the flux exists on intermediate ( 50 pc ) scales .",

    "each of these observations were taken using the acis - s3 back - illuminated ccd . the level 1 event files were reprocessed by ciao 3.2 using gain file acisd2000 - 01 - 29gain_ctin0003.fits .",
    "the count rate in the 2.5 to 7 kev band on acis - s1 was used to filter out periods with flares using the ciao lc_clean tool , yielding a total exposure time of 196.6  ks for the x - ray images presented here .",
    "each of the observations were reprojected to have the same coordinate system as observation 4954 .    for spectral analysis , we extracted spectra for a particular region from each of the event files .",

    "chandra x - ray observations of the central region ( fig .  [ xband ] ) reveal a compact source coincident with the compact radio core of .",
    "registration between the x - ray and radio images was tested using observations of a serendipitous background agn located 2 arcminutes east of . at 5 ghz",
    "a 19 mjy source is detected at ra ( j2000 ) 12 49 06.250 @xmath6 0.01 and declination ( j2000 ) @xmath241 17 50.414 @xmath6 0.1 .",

    "the good agreement between the x - ray and radio positions ( fig .",
    "[ xband ] ) indicates that the chandra observations were at least as good as its nominal astrometry of 0.6 arcseconds @xcite .",
    "this astrometry also results in good agreement with the location of the optical nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ xopt ] ) . hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations by @xcite reveal a double optical nucleus with separation @xmath40.25 arcseconds oriented along a position angle of @xmath11120 with the brighter component to the south - east .",
    "the optical astrometry , however , is not sufficiently accurate to identify which optical component is coincident with the subparsec - scale radio core shown in fig .",

    "the x - ray emission from the location of the nucleus was extracted within a circle centred on 12 48 49.26 , @xmath241 18 39.52 ( j2000 ) , of radius 0.95 arcsec .",
    "the background region was a sector centred on the same position , between radii of 1.11 and 2.67 arcsec , and at an angle of between 6.9 and 215.9  measured from north towards the east .",
    "this region excludes the bright thermal emission to the north and west of the nucleus . while compact",
    ", we can not estimate a size for the nucleus more precise than @xmath40.5 arcseconds owing to the bright and complex emission in the central region . in fig .",
    "[ xspec ] we show a fit to the central source using a mekal spectrum , with the absorption taken from the @xcite results .",
    "although an additional free absorption component at the redshift of the cluster was allowed , the best fit result required no additional absorption .",
    "the best fitting parameters are a temperature of 0.75 @xmath6 0.06 kev , and an abundance of 0.22 @xmath6 0.03 solar @xcite .",
    "a power - law model did not provide a good fit to the data .",
    "the temperature distribution in the central region of the cluster derived from the x - ray observations is shown in fig .",
    "[ xtemp ] . to create the temperature and absorption maps , spatial regions in the x - ray image containing approximately 400 counts between 0.5 and 7  kev",
    "were chosen using the bin accretion tessellation algorithm of @xcite .",
    "spectra from these region were independently fit using a mekal model with free absorption , temperature , abundance and normalization in the same energy range using c - statistics .",
    "the resulting temperature and absorption maps were smoothed with a gaussian of 0.49 arcseconds for display purposes . the statistical uncertainty on the temperature is around 0.05  kev in the central regions , and the absorption is uncertain by about @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "to refine our estimate of the central density we fit a two - temperature mekal model in several incomplete annuli ( see fig .  [ xtract ] ) .",
    "the regions were chosen to avoid contamination from the bright thermal emission to the east , and from the plume . in this way we attempt to calculate the undisturbed density profile in the central region of the centaurus cluster ( fig .",
    "[ xfit ] ) . by fitting a two - temperature model",
    "this includes the effect of hotter gas projected on top of colder gas at the center of the cluster , or any other multiphase material . fitting a model in which the density varies as a power law function of the radius to all but the central point ( which could be contaminated by nuclear emission ) we find an electron density : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is given in arcseconds .",
    "no significant change in temperature or abundance is present at the location of the nucleus .",
    "the luminosity of the thermal component is 3.7 @xmath16 erg / s between 0.1 and 10 kev . using a powerlaw index of 1.7 , and allowing for absorption on the nucleus in addition to that on the thermal component",
    ", we derive a 3-sigma upper limit of 1.2 @xmath17 10@xmath18 erg / s in the 2 - 10 kev band for any non - thermal power - law component ( corrected for absorption ) .",
    "no counterjet is in evidence on parsec - scales , suggesting that the nucleus is doppler boosted .",
    "the 3@xmath19 limit on the counterjet side is 0.27 mjy , providing a minimum jet : counterjet ratio of 9:1 for the inner jet . for the jet component at 115 mas",
    ", the surface brightness reaches 2.7 mjy / beam in the tapered image , and a counterjet could be detected as faint as 0.45 mjy / beam , so the lower limit on the jet : counterjet ratio is 6:1 .",
    "significant doppler boosting would produce a counterjet component closer to the nucleus , and more compact so it is this counterpart to the larger component that we would more naturally detect . assuming a spectral index of @xmath20 , we find @xmath21cos(@xmath22 ) @xmath23 0.34 , implying an orientation of less than 70  from the line - of - sight and a minimum jet velocity of 0.3 c ( lorentz factor , @xmath24 @xmath23 1.05 ) .",
    "this may indicate that projection effects are also important on larger scales for the radio emission , although there is some evidence that the orientation of the jet is strongly modified on kiloparsec scales .",
    "it could be that dense thermal material has stopped the expansion of the source in the north - south direction , and that deceleration of the jet occurs on small scales in cooling core clusters as seen in other cooling core sources previously studied with vlbi ( e.g. , hydra a , taylor 1996 ; a2597 , taylor et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "another estimate of the lorentz factor of the jet can be obtained from assuming a freely expanding jet ( e.g. , salvati et al .",
    "1998 ) which is expected to show an intrinsic opening angle of 1/@xmath24 . under this assumption",
    "we estimate from the observed opening angle of 18  a lorentz factor of 3.2 . this could be less due to projection effects if the jet is pointed close to the line - of - sight .",
    "a consistent solution can be obtained with @xmath24 = 3.2 , @xmath21 = 0.95 , and an orientation of 69@xmath9 from the line - of - sight ( i.e. , fairly close to the plane of the sky ) .",
    "we can estimate the minimum kinetic energy of the jet from the energy required to evacuate the bubbles in the two lobes .",
    "these energies are 4.5 @xmath25 erg for the eastern bubble , and 3.7 @xmath26 erg for the western bubble @xcite . assuming an age for the bubbles of @xmath27 years ( corresponding to an average growth rate of 0.03 c from buoyancy arguments by dunn & fabian )",
    ", we get a mechanical energy input required from the jets of 8 @xmath28 erg s@xmath1 . with a factor of 4 ( @xmath29 with @xmath30 ) for the total energy in relativistic particles in a bubble , together with a factor for the lobes being overpressured since they are growing , the output could be up to ten times larger .",
    "this falls about a factor 3 short of the x - ray cooling luminosity , required to stem a cooling catastrophe in a few gyr , or about @xmath31 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "in either case of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) seen directly , or indirectly via heating , the nucleus has a relatively low power compared to radio galaxies of similar radio luminosity @xcite .",
    "absorption does not seem to be important , so the accretion onto the core must be radiatively inefficient .",
    "the large inclination angle of @xmath470  ( see  5 ) is consistent with the relation between core x - ray power and inclination angle found by @xcite for a sample of fr  i radio galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggest that the decreasing x - ray luminosity with increasing inclination is caused by beaming of the x - ray emission .",
    "this can be explained if a substantial fraction of the non - thermal x - ray emission is produced by the doppler - boosted jet .",
    "@xcite measure a velocity dispersion , @xmath19 , in ngc  4696 of 262 km s@xmath1 . using the @xmath32 - @xmath19 relation derived by @xcite for 10 early - type galaxies",
    ", this velocity dispersion translates to a black hole mass , @xmath32 , of 3 @xmath33 with an uncertainty of about a factor of 2 .",
    "this is close to that estimated by @xcite , based on the same measurements of @xmath19 by @xcite and the @xmath32 - @xmath19 relation derived by @xcite .",
    "the bondi accretion radius , @xmath34 , where the gravitational potential dominates over the thermal energy , for a black hole of mass @xmath32 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the proton mass , and @xmath37 is the temperature of the accreting material . from this",
    "we derive a bondi accretion radius of 30 pc . at the distance of  this",
    "corresponds to a radius of 0.14 arcsec , which is not resolved by our x - ray observations . from our fit to the density profile from  4 , at 0.14 arcsec we estimate an electron density of 0.2 @xmath38 with an uncertainty of a factor of 2 .",
    "the bondi accretion rate within this radius is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the density , and @xmath41 is the sound speed given by @xmath41 @xmath4 2.7 @xmath42 cm s@xmath1 with @xmath43 kev the ism temperature in units of kev . for",
    "we find an accretion rate of 0.014 . assuming a 10% conversion efficiency into radiation , this predicts a luminosity of 8 @xmath44 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "this luminosity is nearly four orders of magnitude more than observed in x - rays (  4 ) , or to put it another way , the radiative efficiency , @xmath45 , is @xmath46 .",
    "we can also compare the accretion energy output to that of the jet (  5 ) , and find that it is an order of magnitude larger than required to blow the bubbles .",
    "it could be that the bondi accretion has been suppressed somewhat by energy injected into the ism by the jet @xcite , or by the presence of a binary black hole within the bondi radius , if the double optical nucleus @xcite is interpreted this way .",
    "another explanation to balance the energy output with requirements could be that the mass of the black hole is a factor 2 lower , and the density is similarly overestimated , which would reduce the energy output by 1 order of magnitude , commensurate with the kinetic energy estimated for the jet .",
    "the black hole in the nucleus of m87 has a mass of 3 @xmath47  derived from hst spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the bondi accretion rate in m87 @xcite is @xmath40.1 , about eight times that in predicting a nuclear luminosity of 5 @xmath48 erg s@xmath1 . the kinetic energy estimated for the jets in m87 is at least 3 @xmath49 erg s@xmath50 @xcite , nearly an order of magnitude higher than estimated for . with a factor of @xmath410 for overpressured bubbles of relativistic particles",
    ", the output could be up to ten times larger .",
    "as for , this is still about 1 order of magnitude less than the predicted nuclear luminosity .",
    "another nearby cd elliptical galaxy that has been studied with chandra is ngc 6166 ( which hosts the radio source 3c  338 ) in a2199 @xcite . in ngc 6166",
    "the derived bondi accretion rate is 0.03 , providing a luminosity of 2 @xmath48 erg s@xmath1 and a similarly low x - ray luminosity and accretion efficiency is derived .",
    "the minimum kinetic energy estimated to inflate the observed bubbles is 5@xmath25 erg for the eastern bubble , and 17 @xmath26 erg for the western bubble @xcite . again assuming growth at the buoyant velocity ,",
    "the minimum kinetic energy estimate is 6 @xmath28 erg s@xmath1 , but could be greater by a factor of 10 for overpressured bubbles of relativistic particles .",
    "the jets of ngc  6166 therefore require about a factor 30 less energy than available from bandi accretion , somewhat less then for m87 and .",
    "along with m87 @xcite , and ngc 6166 @xcite , ngc 4696 provides a third elliptical galaxy where the accretion rate onto a supermassive black hole can be studied in detail .",
    "all three of these systems have inner bubbles traced by the thermal gas that allow for an estimation of the time - averaged kinetic energy of the jets @xcite .",
    "these energies are systematically 10 - 30 times lower than the energy available from bondi accretion ( assuming 10% conversion efficiency ) .",
    "however , this narrow range of values and the equally remarkable narrow range in radiative efficiency for these systems , which are all low with @xmath51 , may indicate a universal property of accretion in the generation of jets , and will be explored further in a future paper ( in preparation ) . a low , but broader range of accretion efficiency of @xmath52 to @xmath53 is found by @xcite for 13 fr  i galaxies from the 3cr and b2 catalogs .",
    "@xcite suggest that m87 may be currently in a low state . with the addition of  to the small number of radio galaxies ( including 3c338 ) for which the bondi radius can be estimated , and an accurate value of the radiative efficiency calculated",
    ", this argument weakens .",
    "it is more likely that for the majority of the time the accretion efficiency is low .",
    "we note that given its proximity and our estimated lorentz factor of @xmath43 , the expected motion of the jet components in  is 2 mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "this motion could be readily detected in vlbi observations spread out over a few months .",
