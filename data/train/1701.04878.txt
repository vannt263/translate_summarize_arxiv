    "while ohmic and dielectric losses in transmission lines ( tl ) have a simple representation within the rlgc telegraph model , due to their local characteristics , there is no simple radiation losses model for tl .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze the radiation process in two conductors tl in free space with the scope of incorporating the radiation losses phenomenon into the rlgc model of the tl .",
    "some preliminary results have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the methodology we use is the same one used to calculate any small losses : we use the lossless ( 0th order solution ) for the electric current to derive the losses .",
    "this methodology is used to derive the ohmic and dielectric losses @xcite , and the same approach is used in different radiation schemes from free electrons : one uses the 0th order current ( which is unaffected by the radiation ) to calculate the radiation @xcite .    in section  ii we present a short review on ohmic and dielectric losses , and show that the rlgc model is accurate only for separate forward or backward waves , while in the case both waves coexist , the interference between them results in an additional term .    in section",
    "iii we define the cross section configuration for the tl that we analyze and show that any open cross section can be modeled in the far field by a twin lead tl , i.e. parallel thin wires separated by an equivalent distance @xmath0 . for close cross sections ( like the coaxial cable ) , this equivalent separation @xmath1 , and they practically do not radiate .    in section  iv we analyze an infinite tl and show that there is no radiated power ( per length unit ) , ignoring nearby objects which can interfere with the fields .",
    "this suggests that radiation from tl must emerge from the termination , in analogy with optical transition radiation ( otr ) @xcite .    in section  v we calculate the power radiated by a semi - infinite tl carrying a wave traveling toward the termination and find that it is proportional to the frequency squared times @xmath2 ( the tl length has no effect , being infinite ) .",
    "we also show that the radiated power results are identical for the case of a single wave traveling into the termination or out of the termination , while in the case of a combination of waves their radiated powers add up , so that the interference between the waves has no contribution .    in section",
    "vi we calculate the power radiated by a finite line of length @xmath3 carrying a forward wave .",
    "we find that for small @xmath4 the radiation power increases like @xmath5 and for big @xmath4 it just tends to a constant which is twice the power radiated by a semi - infinite tl carrying a forward wave , as expected . for a combination of waves , their powers just add up as in the case of the semi - infinite tl .    in section  vii",
    "we show how to find the parameters needed for the calculation of the radiated power for different cross sections , and perform this numerical calculation on two examples . in section",
    "viii we compare the analytic results of section  vi with simulation results of the ansys - hfss commercial software .",
    "the simulations confirm well the theoretical results with an average error of less than 5% .    in section  viii",
    "we derive the rlgc model for the radiation losses , which requires a series radiation resistance per length unit @xmath6 which starts at a termination and varies along the tl .",
    "the work is ended with some concluding remarks .",
    "note : through this work , the phasor amplitudes are rms values , hence there is no 1/2 in the expressions for power .",
    "the ohmic and dielectric losses are easily incorporated into the rlgc `` telegraph '' model , so that the ohmic loss per length unit is given by @xmath7 and the dielectric losses per length unit is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the voltage and current along the tl .",
    "also one defines the ohmic and dielectric decay coefficients as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the characteristic tl impedance .",
    "however , for unmatched tl , i.e. in presence of both forward and backward moving waves , one has to be careful in evaluating the total ohmic or dielectric losses on the line .",
    "for example , let us consider ohmic losses , for the current @xmath14 in a tl from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the ohmic losses are @xmath17[e^{\\alpha_cl}-e^{-\\alpha_cl } ] \\notag \\\\ & - 4\\alpha_clp^+(0)\\operatorname{sinc}(\\beta l)re\\{\\gamma(0)\\ } \\label{delta_p_c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the power of the forward / backward wave at @xmath19 , respectively , so the first part of the result represents the individual losses of forward / backward waves .",
    "the second part represents the contribution of the interference between the waves , and vanishes in some special cases like the length @xmath20 is an integer multiple of half wavelengths , or the phase of @xmath21 is @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 is an anti - symmetric function of @xmath24 .",

    "( [ delta_p_c ] ) is defined @xmath25 the dielectric losses in presence of both forward and backward waves give a result similar to ( [ delta_p_c ] ) with @xmath26 replaced by @xmath27 .",
    "hence the rlgc model for ohmic or dielectric losses , is accurate for a separate forward or backward wave and in presence of both waves the interference between them adds an additional term , which can be positive or negative .",
    "we attempt in this work to derive a similar model for radiation losses , and in the next section we define the cross section configuration on which we shall derive our results .",

    "the biggest relative errors are at the short tl , where the relative radiation losses are low , and hence more difficult to reproduce accurately with the simulation . for example , if we exclude the shortest tl length of 10 cm from the comparison , the average absolute relative error is 2.78% , or if we exclude the 2 shortest points of 10 and 20 cm from the comparison it drops to 1.82% .",
    "the radiation process can be incorporated in the rlgc model , either by a series resistance per length unit @xmath6 or by a parallel conductance per length unit @xmath211 .",
    "this radiation element in the model represents the power loss per tl length unit due to radiation . for",
    "a wave moving forward in the @xmath24 direction , the power carried by the wave should decrease with @xmath24 , so that @xmath212 in case of the serial representation or @xmath213 in case of the parallel representation .",
    "both representations are possible , but the serial representation is the correct one because the current `` creates '' the radiation , and not the voltage on the line ( which is proportional to the per length charge density ) . when using the lorenz gauge @xmath214 , the vector potential @xmath215 is determined solely by the current density ( as in eq .",
    "( [ a_z_basic_01 ] ) ) , and the scalar potential @xmath216 is determined similarly by the charge density ( but there is no need to calculate it directly , because it can be found from the lorenz gauge ) .",
    "the electric field is expressed as @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the part of the electric field generated by the current density and the second part @xmath219 is generated by the charge density . to determine the far radiating electric field ( which decays like @xmath105 )",
    ", one approximates @xmath106 . using this in eq .",
    "( [ e_a_v ] ) , one obtains @xmath220 so that the charge density generated electric field is in the radial direction , hence it can not contribute to a radial poynting vector .",
    "the conclusion from this analysis is that the radiation is due to the current , so that the serial representation is the correct one .",
    "an additional argument in favor of this choice is the `` self force '' ( or damping force ) on radiating charges @xcite which is co - linear with the charges acceleration so that it may be represented by a serial resistor , the way that we usually represent the radiation resistance of an antenna .",
    "hence , we model the radiation by a serial resistance per length unit @xmath6 in the rlgc model .",
    "the radiation being attributed to the terminations of the tl , the radiation model is symmetric around the middle of the line ( at @xmath19 ) , we shall therefore examine how half of @xmath221 in eq .",

    "hence if the tl length is @xmath3 , @xmath230 from each side , as shown in figure  [ r_finite ]    , only that for a finite tl of length @xmath3 , @xmath223 measures the distance from each termination , up to the middle of the line , so that @xmath230 . in this example , @xmath4 is one wavelength.,width=340 ]    and the model describes correctly the radiation power since @xmath231 \\label{integ_finite}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    unlike in the case of ohmic or dielectric losses , for which the rlgc losses model is accurate only for a separate forward or backward wave , the radiation model is accurate for any combination of waves , because as we saw in the previous sections , the interference between the waves does not contribute to the radiation .",
    "we showed in this work that radiation losses in transmission lines originate from the current in the region of several wavelengths near the termination(s ) ( in analogy with otr @xcite ) , so that one can not define a constant `` per length radiated power '' .",
    "we calculated in section  v the radiation losses from a semi - infinite transmission line and in section  vi the radiation losses from a finite transmission line and the expression for the power radiated from a finite transmission line reduces correctly for a long line to the power radiated by two semi - infinite transmission lines .",
    "this result has also been confirmed up to an error of less than 5% by ansys - hfss simulation results shown in section  viii . a general algorithm to compute the parameters needed for calculating",
    "the radiation losses from any two conductors transmission line of any cross section has been presented in section  vii .",
    "following this , we presented in section  ix a radiation model based on a variable radiation resistance per length unit @xmath228 , where @xmath223 measures the distance from each termination up to the middle of the transmission line ( or from the termination to infinity for a semi - infinite transmission line ) .",
    "unlike in the case of ohmic or dielectric losses , for which the @xmath6 or @xmath211 models respectively are accurate only for a separate forward or backward wave , the radiation model is accurate for any combination of current waves , because the interference between the waves does not contribute to the radiation .    further research is needed in order to generalize the radiation model for transmission lines inside a dielectric insulator , and to generalize the radiation model for multiconductor transmission lines ( mtl ) .",
