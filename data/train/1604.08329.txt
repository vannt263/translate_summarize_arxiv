    "the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is one where an initially absorbing medium is rendered transparent by having a strong control field on an auxiliary transition .",
    "eit therefore requires the presence of at least three levels , and consequently has been studied in the three canonical types of 3-level systems , namely lambda ( @xmath0 ) , vee ( v ) , and ladder ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the presence of additional levels allows the use of additional control fields , which leads to a modification of the eit window .",
    "such extended systems allow the possibility of electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) , a phenomenon where an initially absorbing medium shows enhanced absorption at line center .",
    "eia has been studied  both theoretically and experimentally  primary in n - type ( @xmath2v ) 4-level systems @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that eia resonances are also possible in a new kind of 4-level system made by adding vee and ladder configurations @xcite . this configuration opens up the possibility of observation of eia in rydberg atoms , and has potential applications in switching a medium between sub - luminal and super - luminal light propagation .    when eit and eia phenomena are studied in an atomic vapor at a finite temperature ,",
    "the thermal motion affects the probe absorption profile due to the doppler effect .",
    "the doppler shift is determined by the velocity of the atom and the wavelengths of the fields , which then determines the detunings @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the atom s frame of reference .",
    "since the two - photon absorption for a v - type system contains the term @xmath5 , the medium can be made doppler free by choosing the beams to be co - propagating and of the same wavelengths .",
    "similarly , the two - photon absorption for a ladder - type system contains the term @xmath6 , and hence the medium can be made doppler free by using counter - propagating beams that are of the same wavelength .",
    "this corresponds to a perfect wavelength matching condition , and results in a narrowing of the transparency window @xcite .",
    "however , experimental realization in a real atomic system can not always satisfy this perfect wavelength matching condition .",
    "the difference in wavelengths then leads to a modification of the absorption profile .",
    "eit , under conditions of wavelength mismatch , has therefore been investigated in the three types of 3-level systems @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied in a y - type 4-level system which only shows eit ( and not eia ) @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the study of wavelength mismatch to the phenomenon of eia in a 4-level system made using vee and ladder subsystems .",
    "this analysis is particularly important when the uppermost state is a rydberg state .",
    "in fact , one proposed method of populating rydberg states using diode lasers @xcite results in the eia window disappearing due to doppler averaging of the mismatched wavelengths .",
    "we therefore propose an alternate scheme for excitation of rydberg state .",
    "the combination of vee and ladder configuration used to form the 4-level system is shown in fig .  [ levels ] .",
    "the weak probe field is common to both configurations , and couples levels @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the vee configuration is formed using level @xmath9 , with a strong control field coupling levels @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "the ladder configuration is formed using level @xmath10 , with a strong control field coupling levels @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "the respective fields are denoted by : wavelength @xmath11 , strength @xmath12 , and detuning @xmath13 .",
