    "necessary conditions for the presence of a singularity in ( [ eq : i_ln_feynparam ] ) are then that those line momenta @xmath37 whose coefficients @xmath40 are nonzero must satisfy   = 2_i=1^n _ i _ a i k_i^(l_a , p_j ) = 0 , [ eq : landau ] for every component @xmath42 of every loop @xmath38 , with @xmath43 the matrix that relates loop to line momenta in eq .",

    "in this way , we continue the path through the diagram . because of our assumption ( [ pjnu - zero ] ) , the @xmath42 component can never flow out of the diagram , and therefore the path will stay inside the diagram at each step . if the diagram is of finite order , the path will eventually intersect itself , by connecting a sequence of vertices , v_0 v_1 v_n v_0 .",
    "[ eq : nu - loop ] in general , there is more than one such path if the diagram has more than one loop , but in any case we can pick a loop momentum @xmath38 that flows precisely around the loop specified by the sequence of vertices ( [ eq : nu - loop ] ) . for this loop , all the factors @xmath13 and all the @xmath42 components of lines @xmath54 are positive , and the landau equations ( [ eq : landau ] ) can not be satisfied for nonzero @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , this set of lines , and since they are arbitrary any set of lines with nonzero @xmath50 , can not satisfy the landau equations and can not be pinched on shell .",

    "for such a process , no pinch surface can have internal lines with a one component , and the classification of pinch singularities follows the same reasoning as in minkowski space @xcite .",

    "the simplest regulation for the example above is to take @xmath249 , but with gauge theories in mind it is natural to ask whether dimensional regularization is possible .",
    "although our approach to @xmath3 signature is closely linked to four dimensions , there is in fact nothing to keep us from dimensionally regulating .",
    "the interpretation is particularly straightforward for infrared regulation , which requires @xmath250 , with @xmath251 the number of dimensions , taken greater than four .",
    "we thus imagine adding @xmath252 dimensions to the four dimensions spanned by our coordinates @xmath253 and @xmath254 .    while a full discussion of dimensional regularization for multi loop diagrams would take an extensive analysis , we will content ourselves here with the observation that if we label the momenta of the extra dimensions as @xmath255 , and keep the external momenta in four dimensions , all of the analysis leading to our one loop result , eq .",
    "( [ eq : alt-2-n-4 ] ) , for example , is unchanged .",
    "the effect of dimensional regularization is simply to add a term @xmath256 to every squared mass term in the denominators of ( [ eq : alt-2-n-4 ] ) , @xmath257 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab - coeff - def ] ) , and to introduce an overall integration over the  extra \" dimensions of the form  _ 0^dl _ l_^-2- 1 , acting on the modified integrand , where the prefactor represents the angular volume . in the limit @xmath258 ,",
    "the zero of the angular integration is balanced by the ( infrared ) pole from the radial integral . for infrared finite integrands ,",
    "the net result is unity for @xmath259 , but for divergent integrals as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i-4 - 2-dl ] ) , the result is infrared regulated after the @xmath255 integration .",
    "we have studied scalar perturbation theory in @xmath3 signature , and have identified a natural analytic continuation from minkowski signature , which crosses no singularities and can be used to define diagrams with arbitrary external momenta .",
    "the resulting integrals have a standard  @xmath5 \" prescription for the definition of contours in the presence of propagator singularities .",
    "this enables us to appeal to standard landau analysis to identify pinches of momentum integrals , and singularities in external momenta .",
    "the singularities in @xmath3 are in general quite different than those in @xmath2 signature .",
    "an exception is when external momenta are restricted to a plane in minkowski space ; in this case the contour rotation to @xmath3 signature does not change the integral .    for diagrams that are fully ultraviolet finite ( in all subdiagrams ) , we can introduce two sets of light cone variables , all four of which are linear in all denominators .",
    "we have derived a general expression for such an @xmath7-loop @xmath8-line integral as the sum of @xmath6-dimensional integrals using @xmath3 integration .",
    "whether these expressions can be of use in the practical evaluation of higher - loop scalar integrals is a subject for further investigation .",
