    "<S> controllability  the possibility of performing any target dynamics by applying a set of available operations  is a fundamental requirement for the practical use of any physical system . for finite - dimensional systems , such as spin systems , precise criteria to establish controllability , such as the so - called _ rank criterion _ , </S>",

    "<S> , we investigate infinite - dimensional bosonic quantum systems  encompassing quantum light , ensembles of bosonic atoms , motional degrees of freedom of ions , and nano - mechanical oscillators  governed by quadratic hamiltonians ( such that their evolution is analogous to coupled harmonic oscillators ) . after having highlighted the intimate connection between controllability and recurrence in the hilbert space </S>",
    "<S> , we prove that , for coupled oscillators , a simple extra condition has to be fulfilled to extend the _ </S>",
    "<S> rank criterion _ to infinite - dimensional quadratic systems . </S>",
    "<S> further , we present a useful application of our finding , by proving indirect controllability of a chain of harmonic oscillators </S>",
    "<S> .    one of the most fundamental questions in science is what kind of dynamics a given system can host . </S>",
    "<S> control theory addresses this question in the light of how the dynamics of the system can change as a response to our attempts of steering it . </S>",
    "<S> control theory can be applied at different levels : when dealing with computing devices , for example , one could either classify their dynamics by the primary logical operations they can perform or , at a higher and arguably more useful level , by determining what kind of programs they can run . in quantum computing the first level is typically determined by the experiments , and provides one with a description of the hamiltonian of the system under consideration . on the other hand the second level corresponds to the set of quantum algorithms that the quantum computer is capable of running . </S>",
    "<S> it is at this second level that the capability for a device to perform the algorithms theorists dream of is established or disproved .    to connect the experimental and theoretical levels , </S>",
    "<S> one faces the problem of translating the hamiltonian description to a description in terms of algorithms it can perform . for finite - dimensional quantum systems , for instance _ qubits _ and _ qudits _ , this translation has been accomplished in the 1970s by the development of an elegant mathematical framework dubbed as algebraic control @xcite . in infinite dimension , however , such a translation has been so far elusive . </S>",
    "<S> roughly speaking , the problem encountered is described as follows ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f : recurrence ] ) : in finite - dimensional systems , the state space is ` limited ' , and if the quantum state evolves in one specific direction , it will eventually return to where it started . classically this would be poincare s celebrated recurrence theorem , whose quantum mechanical counterpart is given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in finite dimension , there is in some sense no need to distinguish between opposite directions or , equivalently , to specify the direction of time . </S>",
    "<S> for control theory this allows one to develop a picture in which time is fully eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> single - directed movement in infinite - dimensional systems however can carry an ` intrinsic clock ' , e.g. distance travelled from some initial state , and time can not be eliminated .     ]    now in order to assess quantum control of an infinite - dimensional system , our question is : do all infinite - dimensional systems have an intrinsic clock ? a counterexample is given by harmonic oscillators : just by looking at the system state of an oscillator , one can not tell how long it has been running from any specific initial state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , there is hope to perform the same time elimination and reach an easy description of operations that can be performed in quantum harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> note that these systems are not mere theoretical curiosities . </S>",
    "<S> the control of the infinite - dimensional degrees of freedom of light , trapped particles , nano- and opto - mechanical oscillators , superconductors , bose - einstein condensates , and of collective spins of atomic vapors or solid - state devices are all of major technological interest , and the primary way to address most of such degrees of freedom is the manipulation of quadratic hamiltonians , which correspond to descriptions in terms of quantum harmonic oscillators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will see a specific example concerning the control of arrays of trapped ions at the end of the letter .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter , we prove that a restrictive condition has to be fulfilled in order to assess the controllability of quantum harmonic oscillator networks . </S>",
    "<S> we shall observe that such systems share substantial similarities with finite - dimensional dynamics , which explains the success of previous numerical results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the potential impact of our findings by showing how indirect control methods @xcite , developed previously for spin systems only , can also be applied to oscillators , possibly leading to resource efficient cooling and control protocols . </S>",
    "<S> we start by presenting the basic notions of the algebraic control , revisiting the proof of the _ lie algebra rank criterion _ @xcite and finding why it fails to be sufficient for the controllability of generic infinite - dimensional systems </S>",
    "<S> . then we will focus on quadratic bosonic hamiltonians , which give rise to the so - called _ gaussian operations _ , and we will determine a condition such that the _ rank criterion _ will still be sufficient for controllability in the restricted gaussian sense . in the end , we will present an example relevant to arrays of trapped ions and to chain of nano - mechanical oscillators , where this condition is fulfilled and where local controllability can be proven by applying our general analysis .    </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding evolution operators in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space , defined as @xmath18 , are the so - called gaussian unitary operations since they preserve the gaussian character of quantum states @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> then , restricting to quadratic hamiltonians , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the evolution operator in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 and the finite - dimensional matrix @xmath24 , in particular they correspond to different representations of the real symplectic group @xcite . as a consequence eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : uni ] ) can be recast in terms of the _ symplectic _ representation , providing one with the following evolution equation @xmath25 where , as pointed out above , @xmath24 is no longer unitary , and @xmath26 is no longer anti - hermitian . in this framework , the main goal of the control theorist can be summed up by the following question : which symplectic time - evolutions @xmath24 are achievable by controlling @xmath27 via the functions @xmath28 ? + because the solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : evolution ] ) are elements of matrix groups , one can apply the beautiful framework of lie groups to tackle such questions . </S>",
    "<S> let us suppose that , by setting the control functions equal to constant values in @xmath27 , we can identify a set @xmath29 of linearly independent generators of a lie algebra @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is known as the _ lie algebra rank criterion_. its relevance is due to the fact that , if the corresponding lie group @xmath31 is a subset of a compact group , then all its elements can be implemented with arbitrary precision and the system is said to be controllable . </S>",
    "<S> the _ lie algebra rank criterion _ is an easy and extremely powerful criterion for controllability and works well for finite - dimensional unitary gates since they are subgroups of the compact group @xmath32 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of ( [ eq : evolution ] ) no longer enjoy this property , so we can not apply the _ rank criterion _ directly .    </S>",
    "<S> why and where is the compactness used to prove that the _ rank criterion _ is sufficient for controllability ? </S>",
    "<S> given a generic lie group @xmath33 , a set @xmath29 of linearly independent generators of the corresponding lie algebra , and an element @xmath34 , one can write @xmath35 in principle , in the expression above , there will be some exponentials involving negative times @xmath36 , while , if we want @xmath37 to be reachable by control , we need all the times to be positive so that every exponential in the product corresponds to an evolution described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : evolution ] ) and obtained by setting the control functions equal to certain constant values . as shown in @xcite , the compactness of the lie group is a sufficient condition to switch the sign from negative to positive time : let @xmath38 be one of the generators of @xmath30 and consider a negative time @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath31 is compact , then a sequence of positive times @xmath40 always exists such that @xmath41 in other words , for a given @xmath42 and time @xmath43 , we can always find a positive time @xmath44 , such that , for a given matrix norm , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> + one should also notice that this condition is equivalent to saying that at a certain time , the evolution operator recurs to the identity , that is , recurrence is a necessary and sufficient condition to revert the sign from negative to positive times . </S>",
    "<S> when one deals with non - compact groups , the possibility to switch from negative to positive times is in general lost . a simple and visually clear example in this sense </S>",
    "<S> is given by the squeezing operation in phase - space @xcite : if we continuously apply the squeezing operation , the state gets more and more squeezed and recurrence is never achieved . </S>",
    "<S> + however we will show in the following that for coupled harmonic oscillators , even considering non - compact lie groups , recurrence takes place with arbitrary precision if an additional condition on the system s hamiltonian is met . </S>",
    "<S> since , as we pointed out before , in the proof of the _ rank criterion _ , compactness is used only to revert the sign of time in evolution operators , if one is able to achieve this goal by imposing other different physical and mathematical constraints , then the _ rank criterion _ remains necessary and sufficient to prove that the reachable set is dense in the lie group being considered .    </S>",

    "<S> the _ lie algebra rank criterion _ </S>",
    "<S> remains a necessary and sufficient condition to asses the controllability of the symplectic group , even if the group is not compact , and thus can be used to assess which gaussian operations can be realized given a certain control problem as indicated in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : finite ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> + on a more fundamental level , our argument highlights a hitherto unnoticed connection between the normal mode decomposition of positive definite quadratic hamiltonians  formally an implication of the williamson theorem  and the controllability of sets of coupled oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> this connection is bridged by the notion of dynamical recurrence which , regardless of the infinite - dimensionality of the hilbert space , is always guaranteed for positive definite quadratic hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> the generality of our result makes it at first easy to overlook its potential impact : the applicability of quantum control to continuous - variable systems paves the way to vastly improving fidelities of current experiments as well as using control more efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> this fact can be clearly seen in the simple but quite surprising example we provide below , where our result is used to simplify the controllability properties of a large harmonic oscillator network .    </S>",
    "<S> _ local controllability of a quadratic harmonic oscillator chain _ - one of the most important requirements in quantum information and quantum computation is to dynamically address and control individual interacting systems . from an experimental point of view , it is also desirable to have complete control on a large network by acting only on a small part of it . </S>",
    "<S> indirect control has been already proved for qubit systems @xcite , while , regarding networks of harmonic oscillators , it has been recently shown , for instance , that by probing only one site of the network , one can reconstruct the full quantum state of the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we use our theorem to prove the controllability of a chain of harmonic oscillators , where only one or few sites of the chain are accessible . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of example is relevant if we think , for example , of an array of interacting trapped ions , where in principle one can implement gaussian operations by addressing single ions and manipulating their trapping frequencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + let us start by defining the bosonic mode operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 , satisfying the commutation relation @xmath84=\\delta_{ij}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider an @xmath5-mode bosonic chain , described by a hamiltonian as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ham ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the always - on hamiltonian reads @xmath85 where , for the sake of simplicity , we consider all the oscillators having with the same frequency @xmath86 . if we consider @xmath87 , this corresponds to the @xmath88 coupling , which is the most common between the harmonic oscillators interactions . from now on we will consider the renormalized coupling constants @xmath89 and assume that they are both positive ; a sufficient condition for the positivity of @xmath90 ( for every number of bosons in the chain @xmath5 ) is @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider as the controlling hamiltonians , a local _ phase - rotation _ and a local _ squeezing _ term on the first mode of the chain only , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ : @xmath92 we prove that , by denoting with @xmath30 the symplectic algebra , @xmath93},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , by computing all possible commutators of these operators , of any order , and their linear combinations , we can obtain all the elements of @xmath30 ( details of the proof can be found in the supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the lie algebra is a vector space , any set of linearly independent linear combinations of the above operators satisfies the _ rank criterion_. we have then to show that , by properly setting the control functions @xmath28 , we can identify one of these sets , such that the corresponding matrices @xmath50 are positive definite . </S>",
    "<S> there are in principle infinite choices , in particular it is easy to check that the following set fulfils all the conditions above @xmath94    in practice , this example is directly relevant to arrays of trapped ions and chains of nano - mechanical oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the case of the transverse ionic modes , local controls analogous to ( [ eq : hk ] ) could be obtained by manipulating the local trapping frequencies , as detailed in @xcite and realised in @xcite ( analogous forms of control have been envisaged for opto - mechanical setups as well @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note also that even restricted local control might suffice for certain manipulations , depending on the desired tasks . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , as a side product of the proof reported in the supplemental material , one can show that , if the local control is restricted to phase rotations generated by @xmath95 , the whole symplectic algebra is not achievable , but all the passive operations , comprising beam - splitters and local phase rotations can be realized . </S>",
    "<S> this would allow one to implement , for example , cooling protocols based on swapping excitations between sites of the array .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions _ - while the general control theory of infinite - dimensional systems remains hard , we have found a surprisingly simple solution for the case of quadratic interactions of coupled harmonic oscillators . to demonstrate the applicability of our result , </S>",
    "<S> we have also discussed its application to indirect control ( and , potentially , cooling ) of chains of oscillators . + it is worth mentioning that proving controllability and finding an actual control pulse are completely distinct tasks . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , using the quantum recurrence theorem on the theory level is useful , but for a control pulse one could not rely on it , as the recurrence and hence the resulting pulses would take far too much time . </S>",
    "<S> this is well understood and typically overcome by using numerical routines to optimize the pulses . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> a similar point arises regarding the requirement of positive ( negative ) definiteness of the hamiltonian , which was used as a sufficient element of the proof . in an actual pulse sequence , </S>",
    "<S> it could be beneficial to use non - positive or negative definite hamiltonians in order to achieve faster control . </S>",
    "<S> + last , but not least , let us remark that the dynamics of classical systems governed by quadratic hamiltonians is also described by the symplectic group of canonical transformations : our finding hence applies , as it stands , to the controllability of classical , as well as quantum harmonic oscillators .    </S>",
