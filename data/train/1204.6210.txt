    "however , no definite answer can be given .",
    "based on the two - magnon lineshape and temperature dependence , we propose a coupling of a soft mode to magnetic excitations as an origin .",
    "the coincidence of the energy scales and temperature dependence makes it difficult to differentiate two modes using experimental techniques different from raman spectroscopy .",
    "thanks to the raman selection rules , however , we are able to separate them from each other .    here",
    "we remind the reader that there are soft optical and acoustic modes in structural phase transitions .",
    "the former can be observed by raman spectroscopy while the latter can be detected by brillouin scattering techniques .",
    "although the dispersion of the soft mode can not be directly determined by raman scattering experiments , we can sketch a typical profile by exploiting the fact that the soft optical mode has quite flat dispersion and has a @xmath25-point energy of 26 @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting dispersion curve is illustrated schematically as the dashed line in fig .",
    "the soft phonon is presented together with the spin wave obtained by inelastic neutron scattering experiments ( squares symbols and solid line in fig .",
    "judging from the comparable energy scale of the soft mode at the ( 0,0 ) point and the magnon at the ( @xmath66 ) point , it is apparent that the soft mode crosses the magnon near the zone boundary .",
    "this provides a compelling explanation on the split modes .",
    "since a mixing of the spin and phonon mode occurs near the zone boundary , a coupled spin - phonon character will be manifested at finite momentum .",

    "the discrepancy suggests that there are additional softening channels , specific to the lower - energy branch .",
