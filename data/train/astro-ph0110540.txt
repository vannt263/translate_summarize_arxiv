    "the recent discovery of extrasolar planets on orbits very close to their parent stars ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy et al . 2000 ; vogt et al .",
    "2000 ; butler 2001 ) has raised a number of questions about the formation mechanisms of such systems .",
    "these close - in planetary companions are all presumed to be gas giants , typically with masses of the order of jupiter mass @xmath5 g. it is very unlikely that such planets were formed at their present locations ( boss 1995 ) : current theories ( mizuno 1980 ; bodenheimer & pollack 1986 ) predict that giant planets were formed by gas accretion onto massive ( @xmath6 ) rocky core which themselves are the result of accumulation of a large number of icy planetesimals . the most favorable conditions for this process exist beyond the so - called `` snow line '' ( hayashi 1981 ; sasselov & lecar 2000 ) which is estimated to lie several au from the star , far larger than the actual orbital radii of the known extrasolar planets .    the most popular theory explaining this paradox presumes that giant planets were indeed formed far outside their present locations but then migrated inwards as a result of tidal interaction with a gaseous nebula ( ward 1997a ) .",
    "if a planet is fully immersed in a gas disk then the migration process works as follows : planetary gravitational torques produce density waves carrying angular momentum in the surrounding gas disk . for the planet to migrate inwards ( outwards ) two conditions",
    "must be fulfilled : ( 1 ) interaction with the outer ( inner ) part of the disk should be stronger than with the inner ( outer ) one , and ( 2 ) , the waves must not return to the planet . in a finite disk the only way to fulfill the second condition is for the waves to dissipate so that their angular momentum gets transferred to the disk flow .",
    "it was demonstrated by ward ( 1986 ) that in keplerian disks conditions are usually such that the planet tends to migrate inwards .",
    "the typical timescale of this process , @xmath7 yr for a jupiter - mass planet , is very short compared with the lifetime of the nebula itself ( @xmath8 yr ) .",
    "this short timescale presents a significant problem for the migration scenario because the migrating planet is likely to drift right into its parent star in very short time .",
    "various mechanisms to _ stop _ migration have been proposed : formation of a cavity in the inner disk by magnetospheric activity of the central star ( shu et al .",
    "1994 ) , resonant interaction with another planet in the system ( masset & snellgrove 2001 ) , spin - orbital interaction with the central star ( trilling et al .",
    "1998 ) , etc . on the other hand",
    ", there is a process almost inevitable in the course of giant planet formation  gap formation in the disk near the planet  which can effectively _ slow down _ planet migration .",
    "when the planet is not very massive its gravity can not strongly affect the disk surface density distribution in its vicinity and strong interaction with the gas disk through lindblad resonances ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 , hereafter gt80 ) leads to the rapid migration described above ( so called `` type i migration '' , ward 1997a ) . as the planetary mass grows the drift speed increases but at some point the strength of the torque exerted on the surrounding gas becomes so large that planet simply repels the gas and a gap forms .",
    "this strongly diminishes the tidal interaction because it is usually dominated by high - order lindblad resonances which now lie inside the gap .",
    "thus the orbital evolution of the planet becomes tied to the evolution of the disk and it migrates on the viscous timescale of the disk which could be much longer ( @xmath9 yr or even longer , depending on the viscosity in the disk ) .",
    "this stage is called `` type ii migration '' and its existence might help to explain the survival of planetary systems in the course of their orbital evolution or at least significantly alleviate this problem ( ward 1997 ) .",
    "gap formation also provides a reason for the existence of a maximum mass of extrasolar giant planets ( nelson et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in view of all this",
    "a very important question arises : how massive should a planet be in order to open a gap ?",
    "the answer depends not only on the conditions in the nebula ( surface density , temperature , viscosity ) but also on the dissipation mechanism of planet - induced density waves and the mobility of the planet .",
    "if the viscosity in the disk is absent and the planet is not drifting there is no mechanism which could oppose tidal torques and a gap is opened by an arbitrarily small perturber .",
    "this conclusion changes if planetary migration is taken into account self - consistently because a low - mass planet is able to drift through the gap before gap fully forms ( ward & hourigan 1989 , hereafter wh89 ) .",
    "the planet must slow down its migration somehow for the gap to be opened .    in their study",
    "wh89 demonstrated that the disk surface density is enhanced in front of the drifting planet and is reduced behind it .",
    "this effect _ diminishes _ the difference between the torques produced by the planet in the disk outside and inside its orbit and acts to _ slow down _ the migration .",
    "for some mass of the planet its steady drift becomes impossible , the planet halts , and gap formation ensues .",
    "thus , in this picture there is a minimum mass for gap opening even in an inviscid disk .",
    "assuming that wave dissipation is a very rapid process and that angular momentum is immediately transferred to the disk wh89 estimated this critical mass to be @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a surface density of the disk , @xmath12 is its geometric thickness ( here @xmath13 is the sound speed and @xmath14 is the angular orbital frequency ) , and @xmath15 is the distance from the central star .",
    "typical protosolar nebular parameters were summarized by hayashi ( 1980 ) in the form of the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model : @xmath16 using ( [ hayashi ] ) we obtain that @xmath17 and @xmath18 g at @xmath19 au which is about the mass of mercury .",
    "of course , if the disk possesses nonzero viscosity this mass would increase because viscous diffusion opposes gap formation .",
    "lin & papaloizou ( 1993 , hereafter lp93 ) present a different point of view on the planetary mass required to open a gap .",
    "they also assume damping of the density waves to be local but require mass of the planet to be high enough for the waves to be strongly nonlinear from the beginning and shock immediately transferring angular momentum to the fluid .",
    "they showed that this minimum mass corresponds to the case when the hill s radius of the planet @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the mass of the planet , @xmath22 is the mass of the central star ) is comparable to the vertical disk scaleheight yielding @xmath23 as the relevant mass for opening a gap [ the numerical estimate in equation ( [ m1 ] ) is made for mmsn parameters given in equation ( [ hayashi ] ) ] .",
    "another way to look at this restriction is to notice that at @xmath24 the pressure gradient in the disk in the vicinity of the planet becomes so high that epicyclic frequency becomes imaginary and rayleigh s instability develops .",
    "thus , this restriction could be considered as an upper limit on the mass of the planet that does not open a gap .",
    "values of the gap opening mass estimated by these two approaches differ by a huge factor . indeed : @xmath25 where @xmath2 is the toomre stability parameter ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) and @xmath26 is the epicyclic frequency ( @xmath27 for keplerian rotation law ) ; using mmsn parameters given by equation ( [ hayashi ] ) we obtain that @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath19 au meaning that @xmath30 .",
    "ward & hourigan ( wh89 ) assume that the damping mechanism is independent of the planetary mass and essentially linear , such as viscous dissipation ( takeuchi et al .",
    "1996 ) or radiative damping ( cassen & woolum 1996 ) .",
    "however these mechanisms are probably ineffective in cold , weakly ionized and optically thick systems such as protoplanetary disks ( hawley & stone 1998 ; goodman & rafikov 2001 , hereafter gr01 ) ; in this case tides raised by low - mass planets could propagate much further than just a fraction of disk scale length and gap opening requires significantly more massive perturbers ( ward 1997a ) .",
    "requiring waves to be strongly nonlinear and damp immediately as a necessary condition for gap formation is also probably too radical .",
    "indeed , density waves produced by the planet can still evolve due to weak nonlinearity and are able to form a weak shock even if the planet is less massive than @xmath0 ( gr01 ) .",
    "this mechanism can lead to a gap formation by lower mass planets than lp93 assumed . clearly to obtain a reliable estimate of the critical planetary mass",
    "one must use a realistic wave damping prescription .",
    "goodman & rafikov ( gr01 ) have considered nonlinear evolution of the density waves produced by low - mass planets in two - dimensional disks using the shearing sheet approximation and assuming the background surface density and sound speed to be constant . they have found that a shock is formed quite rapidly ( depending on @xmath31 , typically after travelling several disk scaleheights from the planet but still not immediately ) because the radial wavelength of the perturbation constantly decreases while its amplitude increases ( as a consequence of angular momentum flux conservation ) thus facilitating wavefront breaking .",
    "after wave shocks its angular momentum is gradually transferred to the disk fluid leading to surface density evolution ( thus violating the constant surface density assumption ) .",
    "rafikov ( 2001 ) generalized this analysis by taking into consideration the effects of spatial variations of the surface density and sound speed in the disk as well as the cylindrical geometry of the problem .",
    "realistic prescription of the global angular momentum dissipation was provided under the condition that the surface density and sound speed vary on scales larger than the wavelength of the perturbation .    in this paper",
    "we study the criterion for gap opening by planetary tides by determining under which conditions a steady - state solution for the disk surface density perturbation is no longer possible ( method used in wh89 ) .",
    "planet migration is taken into account self - consistently .",
    "tidal perturbations are supposed to be damped nonlocally by weak nonlinearity and their angular momentum is assumed to be transferred to the disk , as described quantitatively in rafikov ( 2001 ) . for the gap opening",
    "the assumption of varying surface density in rafikov ( 2001 ) is the most important one because it allows us to solve the problem self - consistently ( angular momentum transfer depends on how the surface density is distributed radially ) .    after developing the general analytical apparatus in  [ geneq ] we first explore the case of an inviscid disk in  [ visc - less ] to highlight the most important physical mechanisms relevant for gap formation",
    ". then we generalize consideration to include the disk viscosity in ",
    "[ viscous ] .",
    "finally , in ",
    "[ disc ] we discuss our results .",
    "we study the surface density evolution of a gas disk driven by planetary gravitational perturbations . in our model a planet of mass @xmath21 moves in a disk on a circular orbit with radius @xmath32 .",
    "the background or initial surface density and sound speed @xmath33 and @xmath34 are assumed to vary independently on scales @xmath35 .",
    "the values of the surface density , sound speed , orbital frequency , and disk vertical scaleheight at planet s location are @xmath36 , and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "we have summarized brief descriptions of and references to definitions of the most important variables we use in table 1 .",
    "we are only interested in the radial evolution of the surface density and neglect azimuthal variations .",
    "then the general time - dependent equations of disk surface density evolution are the continuity and angular momentum equations ( pringle 1981 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath11 is the disk surface density , @xmath39 is a fluid radial velocity , @xmath40 is the ( azimuthally averaged ) angular momentum flux transferred to the disk fluid from the planetary tidal perturbations , and @xmath41 is the usual viscous angular momentum flux ( @xmath42 is a kinematic viscosity ) .    from this system one can easily find that @xmath43^{-1 } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(g+f ) .",

    "they have demonstrated that a perturber on a circular orbit exerts a torque on the disk only in the immediate vicinity of the lindblad resonances .",

    "tidal perturbations behave basically like sound waves ( lin & shu 1968 ) .",
    "their nonlinear evolution finally leads to shock formation ( gr01 ) .",
    "after this happens the angular momentum flux of the density waves decreases because it gets transferred to the disk fluid .",
    "taking this into effect account rafikov ( 2001 ) has demonstrated that the angular momentum flux carried by the tidal perturbations @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 here @xmath78 is oort s @xmath79 constant , @xmath53 is the mach-@xmath19 distance [ the distance from the planet at which shear velocity is equal to sound speed , @xmath80 for keplerian disks ] , @xmath47 is a polytropic index , and @xmath0 is given by equation ( [ m1 ] ) . the variable @xmath81 plays the role of the distance travelled by the wave from the planet , and the dimensionless flux @xmath82 was calculated in gr01 for @xmath83 . in equations ( [ f_j])-([t ] )",

    "one can do this only if @xmath86 ( which is always true in this paper ) , so that the region of linear wake formation is separated from the region of its weakly nonlinear evolution .",
    "otherwise these regions overlap and the wave shocks before it is fully formed , significantly complicating the analysis .    for @xmath87 ,",
    "the total angular momentum flux of the waves @xmath76 is conserved and has to coincide with @xmath48 given by the expression ( [ f_0 ] ) ; the value of @xmath88 for @xmath87 is such that this condition is fulfilled .",

    "we prefer to study the problem in a simplified setting assuming that although gap formation is a nonlocal process it still occurs sufficiently close to the planet .",
    "later we will determine the necessary conditions for this assumption to be true .",

    "the only disk quantity which is assumed to vary in our consideration is the surface density @xmath11 . by setting @xmath100",
    "we imply that rapid variations of @xmath11 do not violate the thermal balance in the disk that determines @xmath102 . here",
    "the disk temperature distribution is supposed to be the result of external irradiation by the central star and our assumption of constant @xmath13 rests upon the absence of geometrical effects such as the shadowing by the gap edge ( lecar & sasselov 1999 ; dullemond et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in this `` quasilocal '' approximation , introducing a new variable @xmath103 we obtain from equation ( [ t ] ) that @xmath104^{1/2 }    reproduce the expression for @xmath105 obtained in gr01 .",
    "the disk - planet interaction leads to the radial migration of the planet ( gt80 ; ward 1997a ) with some drift velocity @xmath62 .",
    "we consider the disk evolution in the coordinate system comoving with the planet . in this case",
    "@xmath106 usually it is found that migration is inward , i.e. @xmath107 ( ward 1986 ) . using the definitions",

    "then the ratio @xmath113 is not known a priori and has to be found from a self - consistent solution of the problem .",
    "we take @xmath110 to be the same both inside and outside of the planet which means that global surface density gradients are neglected here as we have mentioned earlier .",
    "gr01 has demonstrated that in the constant surface density disk , the wave shocks after propagating a distance ( in @xmath56 ) @xmath114 away from the planet . in what follows",
    "we will always assume for simplicity that @xmath115 thus taking @xmath116 [ see however fridman & gorkavyi ( 1999 ) ] . in a disk with varying surface density @xmath57",
    "is no longer the distance after which the shock forms .",
    "still , it is convenient to change @xmath56 to a new spatial coordinate @xmath59 given by @xmath117 in terms of @xmath59 , the surface density in our particular problem varies on scales @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the condition for applying our `` quasilocal '' approach ( see  [ local ] ) is @xmath119 we check later in  [ disc ] if this is fulfilled in realistic protoplanetary systems .      equation ( [ evol2 ] ) does not have @xmath21 inside the argument of @xmath121 and this permits one to extract an explicit dependence on the planetary mass .",
    "equation ( [ evol2 ] ) can only describe the surface density evolution when it is supplied with the information about the behavior of the migration velocity @xmath62 as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "in appendix [ drift ] we demonstrate that @xmath122 is a correction factor for the drift velocity caused by the feedback from the surface density variations to the planetary migration ; also @xmath123 in the expression for @xmath64 the migration feedback is represented by second term  it takes into account modification of the contribution from low - order lindblad resonances , which is important because the planetary torque in the outer and inner parts of the disk due to high - order lindblad resonances almost completely cancel .",
    "this means that even a small contribution from low - order resonances could produce a significant effect on the migration speed .",
    "when the feedback is absent the drift speed is determined only by global gradients of @xmath97 and @xmath98 represented by factor @xmath63 in equation ( [ finv ] ) ( see appendix [ drift ] ) .",
    "we will see later that in interesting cases the planet produces variations of @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the direction of migration and @xmath126 in the opposite direction : a surface density increase forms in the disk _ in front _ of the planet , and a depression appears _ behind _ it .",
    "thus density perturbations on both sides of the planet work in one direction  to enhance the effect of the disk in front of the drifting planet and decrease it behind the planet [ neglecting for a moment the fact that factor @xmath113 in equation ( [ finv ] ) could be different from unity ] .",
    "they do not cancel each other ( like in the case of migration due to variations of @xmath97 ) and produce @xmath127 effect .",
    "this means that planetary - driven surface density perturbations tend to _ stall _ migration .",
    "however , these variations are strongest at distances @xmath128 from the planet , where torque generation is weak , thus they need to be large to compete with usual drift due to weak global gradients ( for which cancellation effects are important )",
    ".      we will often use the numerical form of the parameters entering this system , namely @xmath131 where we have used equation ( [ mass_rat ] ) and our calculation assumes that @xmath75 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "equation ( [ main ] ) describes the evolution of the disk surface density and its solution depends on @xmath134 dimensionless parameters : @xmath135 , @xmath67 , and @xmath66 which themselves are combinations of @xmath136 , @xmath31 , @xmath45 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 describes the effect of the planetary tidal torques on the surface density distribution , while @xmath68 tells us how strong the viscosity is . obviously , for the gap to form the second term in the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ main ] ) must be larger than the viscous one .",
    "the feedback which planetary migration receives from the surface density perturbations is described by the parameter @xmath65 defined in equation ( [ lambda_s ] ) and it is strongest for large @xmath65 .",
    "feedback also depends on the value of @xmath66 [ equation ( [ lambda_s ] ) ] which represents the effect of the torque cutoff .    to understand better the meaning of these parameters",
    "let us consider the time @xmath137 which it takes for a planet to drift across a gap with the width @xmath138 .",
    "obviously , @xmath139 , where again @xmath62 is a drift velocity . using equations ( [ f_0 ] ) and ( [ finv ] )",
    "one can easily obtain that @xmath140 time needed for viscous diffusion to fill the gap is clearly @xmath141 finally , for the tidal torques to clear out a gap with width @xmath138 an angular momentum @xmath142 must be supplied to the gas ( see gt80 ) .",
    "if we assume that angular momentum flux carried by the density waves is damped on the characteristic length @xmath143 , then the timescale for gap opening is @xmath144    in our particular problem the characteristic gap width and the wave damping distance are the same and given by @xmath145 [ see equation ( [ x_sh ] ) ] .",
    "then , substituting this into equation ( [ dt_d ] ) we obtain that @xmath146 , i.e. time @xmath67 is a typical timescale for a gas drift through the gap caused by the planetary migration ( in planet s reference frame ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath147 for @xmath86 which justifies our use of azimuthally averaged quantities if @xmath148 [ because @xmath149 is a characteristic timescale for the gap opening , see equation ( [ main ] ) ] . also for this choice of @xmath138 one can easily find that @xmath150 , that is drift through the gap can not replenish material repelled by planetary torques when @xmath151 , and gap could be opened if viscosity is absent .",
    "we will further confirm this conclusion in  [ visc - less ] .",
    "likewise , one can see that @xmath152 which means that viscous diffusion is more important for the surface density evolution than effects of the migration when @xmath153 .",
    "it is also clear that for tidal torques to overcome viscosity and open a gap in a viscous disk one needs @xmath154 , or @xmath155 ( see  [ viscous ] ) .",
    "it is possible that for some values of parameters @xmath135 solution for the surface density does not depend on time - like variable @xmath156 . in this case , the profile of @xmath60 is stationary in the reference frame migrating with the planet .",
    "although planetary gravitational torques tend to repel the disk fluid , planet is mobile enough to migrate through the forming gap and stop its development .",
    "when such a time - independent solution is no longer possible , planet migration stops and surface density evolves with time to form a gap in the disk .",
    "wh89 used the same approach when studying gap formation with instantaneous density wave damping . in their case @xmath121",
    "varies on scales @xmath71 ( wake generation requires a couple of disk scale lenghts to complete ) , i.e. @xmath161 in our notation .",
    "also , to significantly affect the migration speed one only needs surface density variations @xmath162 to be produced .",
    "combined with the definition ( [ lam_t ] ) this gives @xmath163 as a value of their critical mass , in agreement with equation ( [ mwh ] ) . in our case",
    "this mass is larger because wave damping occurs at greater distance from the planet .",
    "we now explore separately cases of purely inviscid disks and disks with nonzero viscosity .      if the viscosity in the disk is absent equation ( [ kin_main ] ) simplifies to @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "it follows from the properties of @xmath167 that @xmath158 for @xmath168 , i.e. for @xmath169 , meaning that @xmath170 ( see appendix [ ap1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that in inviscid disk nothing happens with the disk fluid until tidal wave shocks .",
    "after that , for @xmath171 , @xmath172 suggesting that for inward migration @xmath125 if @xmath173 ( inner disk ) and @xmath126 if @xmath174 ( outer disk ) just like we mentioned before .",
    "the effect of this is to slow down the migration",
    ". we can rewrite ( [ finv ] ) as @xmath175 since integrals are @xmath127 , one needs @xmath176 for the drift velocity to be significantly affected .",
    "the solution of the system ( [ kin_less])-([fin_less ] ) depends on @xmath177 parameters only , @xmath69 and @xmath65 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] we plot the surface density profiles in the vicinity of the planet for several values of @xmath69 and @xmath65 .",
    "surface density increases in front of the migrating planet because there are two fluxes of the disk fluid there  one caused by the migration , another by the planetary repulsion  and they are converging causing a surface density pileup . behind the moving planet",

    "@xmath65 , however , the situation is more complicated : for a fixed strength of planetary torques ( characterized by @xmath69 ) this region first rapidly contracts but then expands again with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "it could be explained as follows : when @xmath225 viscosity can not strongly change the surface density near the planet , @xmath226 and drift velocity feedback is only slightly stronger than in the inviscid case .",
    "when viscosity grows so that @xmath227 , surface density perturbations are strong and viscosity is significant to sufficiently modify surface density in the planetary vicinity leading to a strong feedback : as it follows from equations ( [ gt ] ) and ( [ finv ] ) even small deviations of @xmath60 from @xmath228 are strongly amplified by a factor @xmath229 ( and @xmath230 ) in the expression for the feedback correction .",
    "this effect rapidly lowers the upper boundary of the region where planet could migrate and not open a gap .",

    "thus , growing viscosity tends to amplify migration feedback but then attenuates it as @xmath68 exceeds @xmath69 .    in the viscous disk",
    "the absence of the steady - state solution of equation ( [ visceq ] ) caused by the feedback is not enough to open a gap , a fact emphasized in lin & papaloizou ( 1986 ) and wh89 .",

    "the condition ( [ viscond ] ) coincides with the corresponding criterion used by lin & papaloizou ( 1986 ) and wh89 , but is different from the condition found in gt80 because only gap formation by a torque exerted at a single lindblad resonance was considered in gt80 . in fig .",

    "this rapidly increases the role of the migration feedback so that corresponding limiting @xmath21 could become smaller than in the inviscid case .",

    "one can also notice that it is a migration feedback which initiates the evolution of the surface density leading to the gap formation once the condition ( [ viscond ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "our consideration of the viscous case assumes that the only surface density gradients producing viscous flux are due to the planet - driven perturbations .",
    "however , background surface density varying on scales @xmath35 also contributes to the viscous fluid flux .",
    "we neglected this effect completely when we employed our `` quasilocal approximation '' and omitted factors @xmath236 leaving only @xmath237 in our equations ( see  [ local ] ) .",
    "if we were to include these factors in our analysis a picture similar to that described in ward ( 1997a ) would be found : for large viscosity there would not be an infinite derivative of the drift velocity with respect to @xmath21 at some point as in the case shown in fig . [",
    "fig : drift ] .",
    "instead @xmath238 would smoothly ( but rapidly ) decrease at some point as @xmath21 grows and the migration would change gradually from type i to type ii ( ward 1997a ) .",
    "we are unable to capture this effect working in the framework of our `` quasilocal approximation '' but this limitation can not affect our major conclusions concerning the gap forming planetary mass .",
    "also , when the viscosity is small or when the condition ( [ quazi ] ) is satisfied we should not worry about this effect at all . using equations ( [ lambdas])-([t_0 ] ) we find that these additional viscous fluxes could be neglected if @xmath239 which is usually the case in realistic situations .",
    "the validity of our consideration is restricted not only by the requirements ( [ quazi ] ) and @xmath86 but also by the applicability of our nonlinear wave damping prescription .",
    "its validity was extensively discussed in gr01 and rafikov ( 2001 ) and we will not repeat this discussion here . for small enough viscosity ( @xmath235 ) we found ( see fig . [",

    "this means that typically @xmath241 and @xmath242 so that the condition @xmath243 is marginally fulfilled ( note also that @xmath244 which is the offset value of @xmath51 characterizing the wake generation region , see gr01 ) .",
    "thus , a wave typically shocks after travelling only several @xmath37 from the planet ; assumption @xmath245 is reasonable if @xmath246 which is the case in mmsn model described by equation ( [ hayashi ] ) ( @xmath247 at @xmath19 au ) . in disks with higher viscosity",
    ", the wave will shock even closer to the planet ( see  [ viscous ] ) meaning that initially wake is not tightly wound , but this can hardly change our gap formation criterion .",
    "after the planet grows so massive that a steady - state surface density distribution is no longer possible , time - dependent evolution commences . we do not study this process here .",
    "it is clear however that as soon as the gap opening criterion is fulfilled and disk viscosity is overcome by planetary torques , gap clearing starts behind the planet ( in the part of the disk opposite to the direction of migration ) . as we have mentioned",
    "before this makes propagation of the density waves in the outer disk impossible , and planet migration which is the result of the small difference of the torques on both sides of the disk , has to stall . when this happens the planet gradually repels the surrounding material , carving out a gap in both parts of the disk .",
    "far from the planet gap expansion can be stopped by the disk viscosity or tidal torques from other planets in the system .    this general picture of gap formation ( after the corresponding gap - opening criterion is fulfilled )",
    "was confirmed by the one - dimensional time - dependent numerical calculations in lin & papaloizou ( 1986 ) and wh89 .",
    "of course they used a different gap - forming criterion because of their assumed instantaneous damping of the planet - generated density waves .",
    "but because the reason for the gap formation in our case is basically the same as in theirs  migration feedback and strong tidal torques exceed the viscous spreading  we expect the time - dependent transition from type i to type ii migration in our setting to be similar to what these authors have found in the local damping approximation",
    ". the only differences would be the critical mass at which this happens and the transition timescale .",
    "our results for the gap - opening criterion also seem to be in general agreement with the time - dependent two - dimensional simulations carried out by lp93 , bryden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , although it is hard to make a direct quantitative comparison because our criterion requires knowledge of a larger number of parameters than is quoted in these studies .",
    "typical timescale for a gap to form is @xmath149 . using equation ( [ tau ] ) or ( [ t_0 ] ) , assuming @xmath248 and @xmath148",
    ", one can find that for mmsn parameters this time is about @xmath249 yr at @xmath19 au and @xmath250 yr at @xmath134 au ( semimajor axis of jupiter s orbit ) .",
    "such long timescales can put some restrictions on the numerical schemes which would be able to check the validity of our gap - opening criterion ( they should also have high spatial resolution , typically a fraction of @xmath37 , and be able to follow the formation and evolution of weak shocks in a disk , although numerical viscosity would be a primary concern ) .      using the theory developed in  [ kin_wave ] we can determine the planetary mass at a particular location in a disk for which gap formation is expected and migration switches to a type ii mode .",
    "for the mmsn parameters represented by equation ( [ hayashi ] ) one obtains @xmath247 , @xmath28 , and @xmath251 at @xmath19 au . using fig .",
    "[ fig : pars_regions ] we find that for @xmath252 a gap is opened by a planet with @xmath253 .",
    "thus , if the earth was immersed in a gaseous disk at the end of its formation , it probably could not open a gap ( nonzero disk viscosity only strengthens this conclusion ) .",
    "then type i migration would have caused it to drift to the sun on a timescale @xmath254 yr , but this apparently did not happen .",
    "this result supports the usual view according to which the final accumulation of terrestrial planets via the runaway coagulation of planetesimals or giant impacts of moon - sized planetary embryos occurred _ after _ the nebula was dispersed in the inner solar system .",
    "then earth would not have migrated at all and the question of its survival would not arise .    at",
    "@xmath134 au one finds that @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 ; then critical @xmath258 for @xmath252 .",
    "thus , even the usual rocky core of jupiter alone ( without gaseous envelope ) would likely be able to open a gap ; this would significantly slow down its migration towards the sun and leave jupiter on its orbit far from the central star .",
    "for some reason this clearly did not happen in systems harboring extrasolar giant planets close to their parent stars , and this issue apparently deserves further study .",
    "the value of the critical mass also raises another question : how has jupiter managed to acquire its huge gaseous mass ?",
    "it might be that the timescale for the gap formation at the jupiter s location is long enough ( see  [ time - dep ] ) for the planet to accrete all its mass during the gap - opening stage if the core instability ( mizuno 1980 ) was operating since the very beginning ( core instability and associated planetary mass growth might have actually triggered the gap formation ) .",
    "but obviously more detailed consideration of the gas accretion process is needed to definitely answer this question .",
    "an interesting result following from this analysis is that when a gap is opened in an inviscid disk , there is still some material remaining at the planet s orbit .",
    "this material has the form of a ribbon with radial width equal to @xmath259 because waves launched by the planet can not shock prior to travelling a minimum necessary distance , and , thus , can not transfer their angular momentum to the disk and cause its evolution .",
    "the effects of wave action reflection from the edge of the ribbon or the presence of the moderate viscosity in the disk might lead to the dissipation of such a gas torus .",
    "but if these effects are not very strong then this ribbon phenomenon might have observable manifestations .",
    "using a realistic damping prescription for tidally - induced density waves we have studied the conditions necessary for a gap to be formed in a gas disk in the vicinity of a planet .",
    "it was shown that for small enough planetary mass a steady - state solution for the surface density perturbations exists in the reference frame migrating with the planet . then the details of the surface density distribution in the disk depend on only @xmath210 parameters : the aspect ratio in the disk @xmath136 , the viscosity ( represented here by its dimensionless analog @xmath45 ) , the toomre stability parameter of the disk @xmath2 , and the ratio of the planetary mass to a fiducial mass @xmath0 defined in equation ( [ m1 ] ) . only systems with @xmath260",
    "were considered because larger viscosity could violate our damping prescription based on the nonlinear wave dissipation . we have demonstrated that in disks with @xmath2 between @xmath261 and @xmath262 ( which should be typical in passive protoplanetary disks irradiated by their central stars ) a gap is opened when the planetary mass reaches @xmath263 , depending on the disk viscosity and the planet s location in the nebula .",
    "planets further away from the central star must be more massive to repel the gas in their vicinity .",
    "we obtained an analytical criterion for a gap - forming planetary mass in inviscid disks [ see equation ( [ mass_lim ] ) ] .",
    "our result for this critical mass is in between the previous estimates of this quantity obtained by ward & hourigan ( 1989 ) and lin & papaloizou ( 1993 ) because of the different density wave damping function ( wh89 ) and moderate requirements for the nonlinearity of the wave ( lp93 ) .",
    "the apparatus developed here for following the disk surface density evolution and studying stationary structures in the disk such as the kinematic wave solutions ( see  [ kin_wave ] ) could be generalized to other astrophysical problems ; for example it could be used to study global disk evolution or to extend our gap formation analysis to a system containing several planets .",

    "the surface density itself may vary on different scales . in our particular case",
    "we are interested in the variations on scales of order @xmath32 [ represented by @xmath33 ] which lead to migration in the first place , and variations on scales @xmath282 , which result from the planet - driven surface density evolution . in the vicinity of the planet",

    "it means that the surface density decreasing from the center of the disk leads to a very weak acceleration of drift in @xmath287 disk and slows it down for moderate values of @xmath2 .",

    "ideally , one should also take into account gradient of @xmath11 on short damping scale in the expression for @xmath275 as it was done by ward ( 1986 ) .",
    "this could produce some modification because surface density gradients displace the positions of the lindblad resonances and modify the torque cutoff .",
    "however , while variations of @xmath11 produce contribution to the drift @xmath300 , presence of the gradients of @xmath11 gives rise to the effects of order @xmath301 .",
