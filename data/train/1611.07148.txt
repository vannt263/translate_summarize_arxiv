    "figure  [ fig : emergence_quadruple]b shows the quadruple point as obtained from thermodynamic calculations .",
    "a further increase in @xmath15 , leads to the splitting of the quadrangle to two triangles corresponding to the fluid / dc / sc16 triple and fluid/@xmath16-tin / sc16 triple points ( fig .",
    "[ fig : emergence_quadruple]c ) .",
    "the splitting of the quadrangle into two triangles now occurs along the fluid / sc16 coexistence surface .",
    "the entire process is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : emergence_quadruple]d . in two dimensions , the quadruple point is thus formed by the merging of two pairs of triple points located on the same plane in the gibbs surface .",
    "the degeneracy in the number of degrees of freedom ( four phases , but only three equations to determine the volume of each phase ) means that there is no lever rule , and the volume of each phase is not determined by bulk properties alone .",
    "the degeneracy is removed if we consider the system in three dimensions , where @xmath15 is treated like a thermodynamic parameter ( equivalent to an external field ) . in this case",
    "the gibbs surface is defined in the three dimensional space of @xmath40 , @xmath47 , and @xmath54 ( which is the sum of all three body contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sw ] ) ) .",
    "the quadruple point will be represented as a triangular pyramid , and the volume of each phase at four - phase coexistence is not only determined by the total volume and entropy , but also by the total three - body energy if we constrain it .",
    "we next examine some of the unique physical properties associated with the quadruple point . the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadruple]a was started by interfacing the cubic face of each crystal with a fluid slab , and equilibrated in the isobaric ensemble where the pressure perpendicular to the interfaces is kept fixed at @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to ensure that the size of the interfacial plane is commensurate with an integer number of unit cells for all three crystals at their equilibrium unit cell size . in our simulations we use @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 unit cells in each direction of the interfacial plane for @xmath16-tin , dc and sc16 respectively . with this choice",
    "we ensure that all crystals have the correct unit cell size within @xmath58 .",
    "the simulations show that the system indeed feels the underlying proximity of a quadruple point , in a way that the free - energy differences between all four phases become negligible , and thus the four bulk phases coexist over practical time scales with free diffusion of all crystal / liquid interfaces ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : quadruple]a ) .",
    "next we show that the properties of a quadruple point can be exploited to gain a very fine control over the stability and number of crystalline phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : quadruple]e shows the liquid / solid lines for all crystalline phases , both stable ( continuous lines ) and metastable ( dashed lines ) ones .",
    "the quadruple point is the point where all these lines cross .",
    "this means that , by choosing thermodynamic conditions arbitrarily close to the quadruple point , we can stabilize systems with one , two or three crystalline phases .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadruple]b , c , d where a small change in temperature allows us to equilibrate systems with varying number of crystalline phases .",
    "the ability to tune the stability of a varying number of crystalline phases with just small changes in thermodynamic parameters is one the most interesting properties of a quadruple point .",
    "our simulations also point to the importance of the liquid layer during the solid - solid transition . by placing any couple of crystalline phases directly in contact",
    "we always observe the development of several interfacial liquid layers , despite the fact that the liquid is not a stable phase in these state points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : quadruple]c - e ) .",
    "solid - solid transitions in our systems always proceed in two - steps , where the first step is the melting of the interfacial particles of one solid , and the second step is the nucleation of the second solid phase from this liquid layer .",
    "this scenario is similar to what recently observed in solid - solid phase transitions of colloidal systems  @xcite , and is due to the high interfacial cost of forming a solid - solid interface .",
    "quadruple points have not been found before in single - component systems , and the reason behind their improbability is embodied in the gibbs phase rule .",
    "each phase corresponds to a different thermodynamic function ( in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble these functions are the chemical potentials of each phase ) , and a quadruple point requires the equality of these functions at a single ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) state point .",
    "since the equality of four different chemical potentials is equivalent to a system of three equations in two variables ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , the system should have no solution , and genuine quadruple points should not occur in one - component systems .",
    "the way this limitation is circumvented in our system is by promoting the parameter @xmath15 to an independent thermodynamic variable , so extending the dimensionality of space to three dimensions .",
    "this allowed us to explore the full ( @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath15 ) space ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3dpd ] ) , where we were able to find the condition on @xmath15 for the existence of the quadruple point , where the four phases have the same chemical potential .",
    "but , besides the extension of the dimensionality of state - space , a quadruple point also requires three different stable crystalline phases in a close region of state - space , a condition which is rarely met in one - component systems .",
    "we note that the sw model itself did not meet this requirement until the recent discovery of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "our work opens for the possibility of realizing a one - component system with a quadruple point in a practical sense , by finding the conditions at which the strength of the tetrahedral interaction matches the conditions we highlighted in this work .",
    "the most likely candidate for such a system are patchy particles , which are colloidal systems with functionalized patches on their surface  @xcite .",
    "tuning the angular width of the directional interactions plays a role similar to the parameter @xmath15 in the sw potential  @xcite , and allows for the tuning necessary to unveil four - phase coexistence .",
    "here we have determined the full three dimensional phase diagram for the sw model .",
    "the relevant crystalline phases are @xmath13 , @xmath16-tin , @xmath14 , @xmath21 ( and the yet unidentified crystalline phase @xmath43 ) .",
    "apart from @xmath21 and @xmath43 , the remaining phases have been confirmed experimentally for group xiv elements , for which the sw potential is a good coarse - grained model .",
    "the model also displays a quadruple point in the sense that the four phases have the same chemical potential there . for this model",
    "@xmath39 we have fully determined the ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) and ( @xmath0,@xmath40 ) phase diagrams , and also computed the liquid - gas critical point , showing that the quadruple point is a stable feature of the phase diagram .",
    "thanks to the development of technology , a systematic control of the hamiltonian of a system is now realistic even in experiments : for examples , ordinary and patchy colloids with more than two types of interactions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , proteins ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , and application of optical and magnetic fields in quantum systems ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "in such a case , the gibbs phase rule , which has been considered for two independent thermodynamic variables , should be extended by including an additional variable linked to the interaction potential : @xmath59 , where @xmath44 is a number of independent thermodynamic and hamiltonian - related variables  @xcite .",
    "although we have studied a case of a pure substance ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , the above extension of the gibbs phase rule is not limited to single - component systems .",
    "furthermore , by computing the phase diagram as a function of the tetrahedral parameter @xmath15 our results can lead to better modelling of atomic systems or enable the design of novel coarse - grained potential for new generation materials with directional interactions ( _ e.g. _ , patchy particles )  @xcite .",
    "our results can also lead to a better understanding of tetrahedral materials which are arguably the most important class of materials in nature and technology .",
    "for example , our results reinforce the parallelism between pressure and frustration effects , which is an important principle in the understanding of water mixture and their glass - forming ability ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in the sw model",
    ", @xmath15 controls the degree of deviation from tetrahedrality , and the phase diagram in @xmath15 has many points in common with v - shaped phase diagram of real elements in pressure @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath15-@xmath0 phase diagram at ambient pressure , resembles the the @xmath1-@xmath0 phase diagram of tin ( sn ) , with its succession of grey - tin ( @xmath13 ) , white - tin ( @xmath16-tin ) and @xmath14 phases .",
    "as recently shown in vo@xmath12  @xcite for the ultrafast insulator - metal transition @xcite , high - order points can be used to design phase - change materials , where properties change rapidly by applying mechanical stress , heating / cooling , or even tuning the interaction potential ( as shown here ) by modifying internal degrees of freedom such as spin and electronic states with electromagnetic excitation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus high - order points open new directions in the control of materials properties .",
    "we have shown that we can indeed produce any of four different phases by arbitrarily small variations in @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the quadruple point in a single component system should provide great flexibility in controlling multiple phases . here",
    "we study phase transitions where the density is the relevant order parameter , but they can be any types of order including dipole , spin , charge , and orbital order ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , which are important in functional materials .",
    "the details of the stillinger - weber model are as follows .",
    "the pairwise and three - body interaction terms are given by , @xmath62\\mathrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r - a\\sigma}\\right )   \\\\",
    "u_3(r_{ij},r_{ik})=\\epsilon[cos\\theta_{ijk}-cos\\theta_{0}]^2\\mathrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma\\sigma}{r_{ij}-a\\sigma}\\right)\\mathrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma\\sigma}{r_{ik}-a\\sigma}\\right ) \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 sets the energy scale and @xmath71 the length scale .",
    "they correspond to the depth of the two - body interaction potential and the particle diameter respectively , and determined by materials for which the model is used .",
    "we use internal units where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the units of energy and length respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 is only parameter which differentiates the models .",
    "we compute internal energies and densities at each equilibrium state by performing monte carlo simulations .",
    "the size and shape of the simulation box can fluctuate so as to allow crystalline phases to change their structures @xcite .",
    "a volume - change attempt occurs on every @xmath6 translation attempts .",
    "the number of particles in the box is 1024 , which is large enough so that finite - size effects are negligible .",
    "we obtained the phase diagram by extending coexisting lines from phase diagrams at zero pressure and at @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we extend two - phase coexisting lines in two directions , along pressure axis and along @xmath15 axis .",
    "we perform gibbs - duhem integration and hamiltonian gibbs - duhem integration  @xcite in order to obtain coexisting lines along pressure axis and along @xmath15 axis respectively .    when we compute triple lines , we use the following relationships . for three phases 1,2,3 at coexistence ,",

    "<S> the presence of a point where different phases coexist provides an interesting possibility of switching materials properties , including electric , magnetic , optical , and mechanical properties , by a weak thermodynamic perturbation such as stressing or heating / cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the technological importance of a triple point has recently been shown for a popular candidate material for ultrafast optical and electrical switching applications , vanadium oxide ( vo@xmath12 ) @xcite : it has been revealed that the well - known metal - insulator transition in this material actually takes place exactly at the triple point . </S>",
    "<S> large piezoelectricity near a morphotropic phase boundary is another important example of the importance of multi - phase coexistence @xcite . in these systems , </S>",
    "<S> structural transformations in lattice order are coupled with other orders such as dipole , spin , charge , and orbital , which can be used for applications such as electromechanical or magnetoelectronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> although the role of multi - phase coexistence in the ease of the transition is not so clear , the minimization of the volume change associated with a phase transition may be realized by combined nucleation of two phases with different signs of the volume change upon the transition , which has been reported for a transition near a ferroelectric - anitiferroelectric - paraelectric triple point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , the presence of a multiple point may provide a novel kinetic pathway of phase transition , for which the barrier for phase transformation is much lower than an ordinary phase transition between two phases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the fundamental understanding of multiple - phase coexistence is not only of scientific interest but also of technological importance .    </S>",
    "<S> to study the basics of multi - phase coexistence , we need a model system which shows rich polymorphism . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , it is well known that water exhibits a rich variety of crystal polymorphs ( at least , 16 types of crystals  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this , here we study systems interacting with tetrahedral interactions ( e.g. , covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding ) . </S>",
    "<S> tetrahedral interactions are the most important category of directional interactions found in nature , both in terms of abundance , and in terms of unique physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> they are ubiquitous in terrestrial and biological environments , and fundamental for technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> the disordered ( liquid ) phases of tetrahedral materials show unique thermodynamic properties , the most important being water s anomalies  @xcite , like the density maximum , the isothermal compressibility and specific heat anomaly , etc . </S>",
    "<S> ordered phases of tetrahedral materials are of fundamental importance in industrial application , as they include open crystalline structures , like the diamond cubic ( @xmath13 ) crystal , or the quartz crystal , with unique mechanical , optical and electronic properties . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in si and ge , the diamond cubic ( @xmath13 ) crystal is a semiconductor , whereas the liquid and body - centred cubic ( @xmath14 ) crystal are metal . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath13 crystals of mesoscopic particles ( like colloids ) are also a promising candidate for photonic crystals @xcite . it is thus not surprising that tetrahedral interactions are one of the focus of nanotechnology , with the aim of producing new generation of materials with properties that can be finely controlled by design  @xcite .    in order to understand the bulk behaviour of materials with tetrahedral interactions </S>",
    "<S> , several coarse - grained models have been introduced . among them , probably the most important and successful model is the stillinger - weber ( sw ) potential  @xcite , in which tetrahedrality is enforced with the use of three - body force terms . </S>",
    "<S> originally devised as a potential for silicon , the model has found widespread applicability for several materials , especially group xiv elements , like germanium and carbon . </S>",
    "<S> the key parameter controlling the tetrahedrality of the model is the ratio between the strength of three - body interactions over two - body interactions , often referred to as @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> as tetrahedrality becomes less strong with increasing atomic number , the basic idea is that group xiv elements , apart from energy and length scale differences , can be modeled by simply varying @xmath15  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even more importantly , the modified sw potential has found general application as a coarse - grained model for molecular and supramolecular systems . </S>",
    "<S> the most important example is water , whose structural properties have been accurately reproduced with a parametrization of the sw potential ( called mw water ) with a precision that is competitive ( if not superior ) to the best classical molecular models available to date  @xcite .    despite the importance and widespread applicability of the sw model , our knowledge of its phase diagram is still lacking . determining </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram is challenging because of the three dimensional parameter space ( temperature , pressure and @xmath15 ) , and the fact that all calculations are multiplied by a large number of crystalline structures with local tetrahedral symmetry that have to be tested for thermodynamic stability . </S>",
    "<S> previous attempts have considered stable crystalline structures taken from the elements that the sw potential is ought to describe , as for example silicon . </S>",
    "<S> the first study of the model as a function of @xmath15 was introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where three crystalline structures were identified at zero pressure @xmath1 : @xmath14 , @xmath16-tin , and @xmath13 respectively for low ( @xmath17 ) , intermediate ( @xmath18 ) and high values ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the intermediate region showed increased glass - forming ability  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16-tin phase was believed to be the high pressure phase for sw silicon ( @xmath20 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , according to the current view , starting from a perfectly tetrahedral diamond ( @xmath13 ) phase , the sw system would transform into @xmath16-tin by reducing the amount of global tetrahedrality , either by applying pressure or decreasing the value of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> but this view was recently proven wrong when a new crystal of sw silicon was found , @xmath21 , that replaces @xmath16-tin as the stable phase  @xcite at high pressures . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 is a new crystal with a simple cubic unit cell and 16 atoms in the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for a new understanding of the phase behaviour of the sw model , with new behaviour that should emerge in between the low @xmath22 region ( where @xmath16-tin is thought to be stable ) and the high @xmath22 region ( where @xmath21 is thought to be stable ) .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we show that indeed the sw model exhibits novel behaviour , which takes the form of a ` quadruple point ' ( qp ) , where the fluid and three different crystalline structures ( @xmath13 , @xmath16-tin and @xmath21 ) have the same chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the newly found quadruple point is stable against liquid - gas phase separation , by computing the liquid - gas coexistence line and critical point . at the quadruple point </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath15 takes the value @xmath23 and the model describes a one - component system with four - phase coexistence . </S>"
