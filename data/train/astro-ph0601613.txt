    "pulsar radio emission typically occurs in a form of periodic series of narrow bursts of radiation . these burst often have a complex structure , in which higher order periodicities can be found .",
    "the individual pulses consist of one , few to several subpulses . in some pulsars",
    "the subpulses demonstrate a very systematic drift across the pulse window . if the pulses are folded with the basic pulsar period then the drifting subpulses form amazingly spectacular patterns called drift - bands .",
    "the phenomenon of drifting subpulses is a long standing puzzle in the pulsar research and its solution would likely result in deeper understanding to the nature of pulsar radiation .",
    "it is generally believed that this phenomenon is inherently associated with the so - called inner acceleration region above the polar cap , in which the magnetospheres plasma does not corotate with the neutron star surface .",
    "the first model based on this idea was proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rs75 henceforth ) .",
    "the predictions of rs75 model were successfully compared with a handful of pulsars known to show this phenomenon at that time . a decade later ,",
    "* r86 hereafter ) compiled a list of about 40 drifting pulsars , but drifting subpulses were still regarded as some kind of exceptional phenomenon .",
    "however , recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wes06 hereafter ) presented the results of a systematic , unbiased search for subpulse modulation in 187 pulsars and found that the fraction of pulsars showing drifting subpulse phenomenon is likely to be larger than 55% .",
    "they identified 102 pulsars with drifting subpulses in their sample , with a large fraction of newly discovered drifters .",
    "the authors concluded that the conditions required for the drifting mechanism to work can not be very different from the emission mechanism of radio pulsars .",
    "wes06 then suggest that the subpulse drifting phenomenon is an intrinsic property of the pulsar emission mechanism , although drifting could in some cases be very difficult or even impossible to detect due to insufficient signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "it is therefore essential to attempt to unravel the physical conditions that can lead to formation of an inner acceleration region above the polar cap that could lead to development of the subpulse drift phenomenon .",
    "the classical vacuum gap model of rs75 , in which spark - associated sub - beams of subpulse emission circulate around the magnetic axis due to @xmath6 drift of spark plasma filaments , provides the most natural and plausible explanation of drifting subpulse phenomenon .",
    "however , despite its popularity , it suffers from the so - called binding energy problem .",
    "namely , under canonical conditions the surface charges ( ions or electrons ) are likely to be directly pulled out of the surface so that a pure vacuum gap is difficult to form .",
    "the alternative steady flow polar cap models , the so - called space - charge - limited flow models @xcite , can not give rise to the intermittent `` sparking '' behavior , which seems necessary to explain the subpulse drift phenomenon in radio pulsars .",
    "* gm01 hereafter ) revisited the binding energy problem of rs75 model and argued that the formation of the vacuum gap ( vg ) is , in principle possible , although it requires a very strong non - dipolar surface magnetic fields , much stronger than a canonical dipolar component inferred from the observed spindown rate .",
    "once the binding is strong enough to prevent the thermionic emission at the full space charge limited flow , the inevitable  drift of plasma filaments will result in the observable subpulse drift phenomenon .",
    "it has been known for a long time that in order to allow all radio pulsars to produce electron - positron pairs ( the necessary condition for coherent radio emission ) , the near - surface magnetic fields must include multipole components dominating over global dipole field @xcite .",
    "growing observational evidence of non - dipolar structure of surface magnetic field-@xmath7 pair production processes , in their calculations of many other physical quantities ( such as the surface charge density ) they still used dipolar form , presumably for the sake of simplicity . ] accumulates , and the suggestion that such a sunspot - like fields form during the early proto - neutron star stage has been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "* gm02 hereafter ) calculated the non - dipolar vg model for 42 drifting subpulse pulsars tabulated by r86 and argued that vg can be formed in all considered pulsars , provided that the actual surface magnetic field was close to @xmath8 g independently of the value of the canonical dipolar magnetic field .",
    "although the binding energy problem could be , at least in principle , resolved by assuming an appropriately strong surface magnetic field , yet another difficulty of the rs75 model was that it predicted a much too fast  drift rate",
    ". motivated by this issue , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gmg03 hereafter ) developed further the idea of the inner acceleration region above the polar cap by including the partial screening by a sub - goldreich - julian thermal flow from the surface due to the spark - associated polar cap heating .",
    "this idea was first introduced by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cr80 henceforth ) , who argued that even with thermionic ions included in the flow , the condition above the polar cap is close to that of a pure vacuum gap .",
    "a similar model was also invoked by @xcite .",
    "gmg03 reanalyzed this model and argued that a thermostatic self - regulation should keep the surface temperature just few percent below the critical ion temperature at which the gap potential drop is completely screened .",
    "this results in more than 90 % of screening due to thermionic emission .",
    "given a similar gap height , the actual potential drop , and hence the  drift rate , is about 10 % of that of the pure vacuum case .",
    "this is still above the threshold for the magnetic pair production .",
    "similar to the avalanche pair production cascade introduced by rs75 , the discharge of the growing potential drop above the polar cap would also occur in the form of a number of sparks . in this paper",
    "we call such an inner accelerator a partially screened gap ( psg henceforth ) .",
    "the latest xmm - newton observation of the drifting pulsar psr b0943 + 10 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zsp05 hereafter ) reveals a possible hot spot with the surface area much smaller than the conventional polar cap .",
    "this is consistent with the polar cap heating from such a psg , which at the same time gives the right  drift rate .",
    "this lends strong support to the psg model .    in this paper",
    "we study psg model in greater detail and explore the physical conditions for the model to work .",
    "we also apply this model to a new set of 102 pulsars from wes05 and show that it can work in every case , provided that the surface non - dipolar magnetic field is strong enough , even stronger than @xmath8 g suggested by gm02 and gmg03 .",
    "our new treatment is a combination of those used in gm02 and gmg03 .",
    "our working hypothesis is that drifting subpulses manifest the existence of a thin inner acceleration region , with an acceleration length scale much shorter than the polar cap size .",
    "the ultra - high accelerating potential drop discharges via a number of localized @xmath6 drifting sparks , as has been envisioned by rs75 .",
    "these sparks produce isolated columns of electron - positron plasma that stream into the magnetosphere to generate radio - beams of the observed subpulse emission due to some kind of plasma instability ( see the  8 for more discussion ) . due to charge depletion with respect to the co - rotational goldreich - julian ( 1969 ) value , sparks experience an unavoidable  drift with respect to the polar cap surface . as a consequence ,",
    "the spark - associated sub - beams of radio emission perform a slow circumferential motion that is responsible for the observed subpulse drift .",
    "this model , which is often called `` a pulsar carousel model '' @xcite , is examined in this paper .",
    "we are particularly interested in the thermal effect associated with the surface bombardment by back - flowing particles produced by sparks .",
    "the intrinsic drift rate ( manifested by the tertriary drift periodicity ) and the polar cap heating rate ( manifested by the thermal x - ray luminosity ) should be correlated with each other , since they are determined by the same value of the accelerating potential drop .",
    "the properties of drifting subpulses are discussed in  2 and the properties of charge depleted acceleration region above the polar cap are discussed  3 .",
    "we find a specific relationship between the appropriate observables and conclud that it holds for a number of pulsars for which good quality data is available ( especially psr b0943 + 10 , zsp05 ) .",
    "it turns out that this relationship depends only on the observational quantities and thus it is a powerful tool for testing this theoretical model .",
    "although the number of pulsars that have all necessary data for such testing is small at the moment , the clean prediction holds the promise to ultimately confirm ( or discard ) the psg model in the future . in ",
    " 4 - 7 we analyze this model in a more detailed manner to investigate the microscopic conditions ( e.g. near - surface configuration , radiation mechanism , etc ) that are needed to form such psgs .",
    "the paper is summarized in  8 .",
    "let us briefly review the characteristic properties of the drifting subpulse phenomenon , in which subpulses typically change phase from one pulse to another in a very organized manner , to the extent that they form apparent driftbands of duration from several to a few tens of consecutive pulses",
    ". usually more than one drift band appears , and the separation between them measured in pulsar periods ranges from about 1 to about 15 @xcite . the subpulse intensity is systematically modulated along drift bands , decreasing towards the edges of the pulse window . in some pulsars , however , only periodic intensity modulations are observed , without any systematic phase change .",
    "these pulsars were identified as those in which the line - of - sight cuts through a beam centrally @xcite , thus showing a steep gradient of the polarization angle curve ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the clear subpulse driftbands are typically found in pulsars associated with the line - of - sight grazing the beam , thus showing a relatively flat position angle curve @xcite .",
    "it is then obvious that both these kinds of subpulse behavior , i.e. systematic drift in phase and phase stationary intensity modulation , represent the same phenomenon , namely , rotation of beams of subpulse emission around the pulsar magnetic axis .",
    "the picture of rotating subbeams is also supported by spectral properties of the observed radiation .",
    "the separation between drifting subpulses in a given pulse show dependence on frequency similar to those of profile components and/or overall pulse width , while the observed periodicities related to patterns of drifting subpulses are independent of radio frequency .",
    "this seems to exclude all frequency - dependent plasma effects as a plausible source of the drifting subpulse phenomena .",
    "also , a similarity of drift patterns at different radio frequencies strongly suggest that the radiation of drifting subpulses is related to a relatively stable system of isolated plasma filaments originating near the polar cap .",
    "the observational characteristics of drifting subpulses described briefly above suggest then strongly an interpretation of this phenomenon as a number of isolated sub - beams of radio emission , spaced more or less uniformly in the magnetic azimuth , and rotating slowly around the magnetic axis . in terms of rs75 model",
    "this means that the subpulse - associated sparks perform a circumferential motion around the pulsar beam axis .",
    "the most spectacular confirmation of this `` carousel model '' was presented by @xcite and @xcite , who performed a sophisticated fluctuation spectra analysis of single pulse data from psr b0943 + 10 and detected clear spectral features corresponding to the rotational behavior of subpulse beams .",
    "these results indicate clearly that sparks do not vanish after passing through the pulse window in the form of drifting subpulses , but they continue to drift around the polar cap and reappear in the same phase of the pulse window after a definite and measurable time period .",
    "the rotational features appearing in the fluctuation spectra of psr b0943 + 10 have extremely high values of @xmath9 ( defined as the central frequency divided by the width ) confirming a circulational nature of the phenomenon .",
    "similar feature with @xmath10 was found by @xcite in psr b0834 + 06 .",
    "quite recently @xcite revealed a system of subpulse beams circulating around the polar cap in psr b0826 - 34 .",
    "the high values of @xmath11 suggests strongly that the trajectories of the spark motion associated with drifting subpulses should be closed .",
    "it is natural to conclude that the circulating sparks would form on average in a ring on the polar cap corresponding to a conal beam of radio emission originating at some height above the polar cap @xcite .",
    "the `` pulsar carousel model '' based on  drifting sparks is widely accepted by radio - observers but theorists usually treat it with a great deal of reservation . besides the binding energy problem ( see  4 ) , they usually point out problems with spark stability and memory , which is indeed necessary to explain the systematic subpulse drift within the carousel model .",
    "this is a very important but difficult problem that requires sophisticated computer simulations .",
    "here we would only raise some phenomenological arguments .",
    "following rs75 , gil & sendyk ( 2000 ; gs00 henceforth ) argued that both the characteristic spark dimension and the typical distance between the adjacent sparks are approximately equal to the gap height . at any instant",
    "the polar cap should be populated by as many sparks as possible .",
    "indeed , spark discharges should develop wherever the accelerating potential drop exceeds the threshold for the magnetic pair production .",
    "such a maximum packing should stabilize an instantaneous arrangement of sparks on the polar cap surface .",
    "each spark develops and dies over a time scale of microseconds , so the question is what agency makes them to reappear in the same place ( such reappearance is necessary to explain the regular subpulse drifting ) .",
    "it seems that a natural reason is thermal emission of charges at the base of each spark is heated by the return bombardment .",
    "moreover , some electrons and positrons from the outflowing spark plasma column would still be near the polar cap surface when the returning potential drop again exceeds the pair formation threshold .",
    "these charged particles would initiate the very next discharge ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more detailed discussion ) .",
    "therefore , the only net motion of sparks is the slow @xmath6 drift across the planes of the surface magnetic field . for the line - of - sight grazing the pulsar beam ( corresponding to sparks operating at the polar cap boundary )",
    ", this circumferential drift motion will be observed as a systematic subpulse drift , while for a more central line - of - sight trajectories only longitude - stationary modulation of the subpulse amplitude can be observed .",
    "the inner acceleration region above the polar cap may be a result of deviation of the local charge density @xmath12 from the co - rotational charge density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gj69 hereafter ) @xmath13 where the positive / negative sign corresponds to @xmath14fe ions / electrons .",
    "these two possibilities correspond to antiparallel and parallel relative orientation of the magnetic and spin axes , respectively .",
    "as mentioned before , there exists growing evidence ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) that the actual surface magnetic field @xmath15 is highly non - dipolar .",
    "its magnitude can be described in the form b_s = b b_d [ bs ] ( * ? ? ? * gs00 hereafter ) , where the enhancement coefficient @xmath16 and b_d=210 ^ 12(p_-15)^1/2  g [ bd ] is the canonical , star centered dipolar magnetic field , @xmath17 is the pulsar period in seconds and @xmath18 is the period derivative . for the purpose of further considerations in this paper",
    "we introduce here a convenient measure of the surface magnetic field = 0.046(p_-15)^0.5b [ bq ] where @xmath19  g is the so called quantum magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the polar cap is defined as the locus of the so - called open magnetic field lines that penetrate the light cylinder ( gj69 ) .",
    "generally , the polar cap radius can be written as r_p=1.4510",
    "^ 4p^-0.5b^-0.5  cm [ rp ] ( gs00 ) , where the factor @xmath20 describes squeezing of the polar cap area due to the magnetic flux conservation in non - dipolar surface fields ( as compared with the gj69 dipolar configuration ) .",
    "one should realize , however , that the polar cap radius @xmath21 expressed by the above equation is only a characteristic dimension .",
    "in fact , in the presence of strong non - dipolar surface magnetic field the actual polar cap can be quite irregular in shape .",
    "also , the light - cylinder radius and thus the canonical polar cap radius depends on the unknown particle inertia ( e.g. michel 1973 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 as expressed in equation ( [ rp ] ) can be used as an order of magnitude estimate of the actual polar cap radius .",
    "the observationally deduced polar cap radii ( see section 3.2 ) are often much smaller than the canonical gj69 value .",
    "this seems consistent with strong non - dipolar surface magnetic field , that is large @xmath22 in equation ( [ rp ] ) .",
    "given a strong enough near - surface magnetic field ( the required condition will be discussed below in   4 - 7 ) , charge depletion in the acceleration region above the polar cap can result from binding of the positive @xmath14fe ions ( at least partially ) in the neutron star surface .",
    "positive charges then can not be supplied at the rate that would compensate the inertial outflow through the light cylinder . as a result ,",
    "a significant part of the unipolar potential drop ( gj69 , rs75 ) develops above the polar cap , which can accelerate charged particles to relativistic energies and power the pulsar radiation .",
    "the characteristic height @xmath23 of such an acceleration region is determined by the mean free path of pair - producing high energy photons . in other words ,",
    "the growth of the accelerating potential drop is limited by the cascading production of an electron - positron plasma ( e.g. rs75 , cr80 ) .",
    "the accelerated positrons would leave the acceleration region , while the electrons would bombard the polar cap surface , causing a thermal ejection of ions , which are otherwise more likely bound in the surface in the absence of additional heating .",
    "this thermal ejection would cause partial screening of the acceleration potential drop @xmath24 corresponding to a shielding factor @xmath25 where @xmath26 is thermonically ejected charge density ( see also eq.[18 ] ) and @xmath27 is the accelerating potential drop , due to general relativistic effect of frame dragging , which can affect the potential drop by as much as 27 percent ( see zhang et al . 2000 ; gil & melikidze 2002 ) . ] where @xmath15 is defined by equation  ( [ bs ] ) and @xmath23 is the model dependent height of the acceleration region ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the above expression for @xmath24 is the solution of poisson equation for a thin psg , assuming that @xmath28 within the acceleration region .",
    "the cascading sparking discharge in psg works analogously to the scenario envisioned by rs75 .",
    "the only difference is that the accelerating potential drop is much smaller due to the partial screening by thermionic ions with charge density @xmath26 .",
    "additional positive charge density @xmath29 is supplied by the spark produced positrons .",
    "the potential drop is completely screened when the total charge density @xmath30 reaches the corotational value ( eq.[[rogj ] ] ) . then the spark plasma escapes from the region as discussed by @xcite .",
    "however , during a short escaping timescale @xmath31 s the thermionic ions still maintain the partial screening as determined by equation ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "thus , the returning potential drop quickly grows to the level defined by equation ( [ deltafau ] ) and the spark begins to develop again .",
    "this results in an intrinsically intermittent nature of psg and an unsteady particle flow into the magnetosphere , which has an important physical consequences for generation of the coherent pulsar radio emission ( see section 8) .    in the stationary observer s frame the co - rotational charge density @xmath32 is associated with the co - rotational electric field @xmath33 and the magnetosphere co - rotates with the velocity @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the magnetic field ( dipolar ) and @xmath36 is the pulsar spin axis @xmath37 . now let us introduce a thin , charge depleted region extending to about @xmath23 above the polar cap surface , with the accelerating potential drop described by equation ( [ deltafau ] )",
    ". since the charge density within this region is lower than the co - rotating value @xmath38 , an additional electric field @xmath39 appears in this region , which makes the spark plasma to drift with a velocity @xmath40 , as observed in the co - rotating frame . to estimate the values of @xmath41",
    "let us follow the original method of rs75 and consider the closed contour @xmath42 within the gap , as marked in figure  4 of rs75 .",
    "since the potential drop along segments @xmath43 and @xmath44 vanishes @xmath45 , one then has @xmath46 , where @xmath47 corresponds to the tangent electric field @xmath39 , while @xmath48 is just the acceleration potential drop expressed by equation ( [ deltafau ] ) .",
    "however , we can consider another segment @xmath49 ( parallel to @xmath50 ) and use the same argument to demonstrate that @xmath51 for any arbitrary pair of points @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this means that @xmath54 within the rs75 gap , except at the boundary region within about @xmath23 from the polar cap boundary , where @xmath23 is the height of the gap .",

    ". the situation can be slightly different if the gap height @xmath23 ( length of segments @xmath50 and @xmath49 ) varies between the pole and the polar cap edge , although in the thin gap case of rs75 @xmath56 such variations can not be large @xmath57 . in this case @xmath58 and @xmath59 and some residual @xmath41 can exist over the entire polar cap area . in any case , the tangent electric field is strong only at the polar cap boundary where @xmath60 ( see appendix  a in gmg03 for details ) .",
    "here @xmath15 is the surface magnetic field ( eqs .",
    "[ [ bd ] ] and [ [ bs ] ] ) , @xmath24 is the accelerating potential drop ( eq .",
    "[ [ deltafau ] ] ) , @xmath23 is the gap height ( eqs .  [",

    "this electric field causes that discharge plasma at the polar cap boundary performs a slow circumferential motion with velocity @xmath62 .",
    "the time interval to make one full revolution around the polar cap boundary is @xmath63 .",
    "one then obtains the so called tertiary drift periodicity @xmath64 which is the proper measure of the intrinsic drift rate , at least at the boundary of the polar cap .",
    "if the plasma above the polar cap is fragmented into filaments ( sparks ) which determine the intensity structure of the instantaneous pulsar radio beam , then , at least in principle , the tertiary periodicity @xmath1 can be measured / estimated from the pattern of the observed drifting subpulses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice",
    "@xmath1 is very difficult to measure ( mainly because of aliasing which is a severe problem even in pulsars with high signal - to - noise ratio , e.g. dr99 , gs03 ) and its value is known at the moment only in few cases .",
    "it is much easier to measure the primary drift periodicity @xmath65 , which in high signal - to - noise ratio is just a distance between the observed drift bands measured in pulsar periods @xmath17 ( there are also clever techniques that allow to measure @xmath65 even in cases with very low signal - to - noise ratio ; see edwards & stappers 2002 , wes06 ) . since @xmath66 ( e.g. rs75 ) , where @xmath67 is the number of sparks contributing to the drifting subpulse phenomenon observed in a given pulsar ( gs00 ) , then one can write the shielding factor in the form @xmath68 which depends only on relatively easy - to - measure primary drift periodicity @xmath65 ( wes06 )",
    "this equation can be compared with the definition of shielding factor ( eq.[[eta ] ] ) in order to derive the amount of thermally ejected iron ions or electrons ( depending on the sign of charge of the polar cap ) .",
    "apparently , the shielding parameter @xmath61 should be much smaller than unity .",
    "note that in the rs75 pure vg model one has @xmath69 , which implies the predicted subpulse drift at least an order of magnitude too fast as compared with observations .",
    "this means that the conditions within the natural inner acceleration region above the polar cap should greatly differ from the pure vacuum gap proposed by rs75 .",
    "gmg03 argued that because of the exponential sensitivity of the accelerating potential drop @xmath24 to the surface temperature @xmath4 , the actual potential drop should be thermostatically regulated ( see also cr80 ) .",
    "in fact , when @xmath24 is large enough to ignite the cascading pair production , the back - flowing relativistic charges will deposit their kinetic energy in the polar cap surface and heat it at a predictable rate .",
    "this heating will induce thermionic emission from the surface , which will in turn decrease the potential drop that caused the thermionic emission in the first place . as a result of these two oppositely directed tendencies , the quasi - equilibrium state should be established , in which heating due to electron bombardment is balanced by cooling due to thermal radiation .",
    "this should occur at a temperature @xmath4 slightly lower than the critical temperature above which the polar cap surface delivers thermionic flow at the corotational ( gj69 ) charge density level ( see gmg03 for more details ) .",

    "this height is model dependent and we discuss two possible models below ( eqs .  [ [ hcr ] ] or [ [ hics ] ] ) .",
    "growing evidence suggests that in actual pulsars @xmath4 is few mk ( see table  1 ) .",
    "thus , from the above equation one can infer that @xmath75 , where the shielding parameter should be much lower than unity ( see discussion below eq .",
    "[ [ deltafau ] ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the enhancement coefficient @xmath76 ( eq .  [ [ bs ] ] ) should be much larger than unity ( at least of the order of 10 ) .",
    "this is very consistent with the binding energy problem discussed in section  4 .",
    "indeed , the extremely high surface magnetic field helps to resolve this problem .",
    "the predicted thermal x - ray emission luminosity from the polar cap with temperature @xmath4 is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath21 is the actual polar cap radius ( eq .  [ [ rp ] ] ) and",

    "we can now use the equation  ( [ p3p ] ) in the form @xmath85 and derive the thermal x - ray luminosity from the polar cap heated by sparks , i.e. l_x=2.510 ^ 31()^-2 [ lx ] , where @xmath1 is the tertiary periodicity in drifting subpulses pattern ( pulsar carousel time ) , which is equal to the time interval needed for the discharge plasma to make one full revolution around the perimeter of the polar cap .",
    "one can also derive the x - ray luminosity efficiency ( with respect to the spin down luminosity ) = 0.63 ( ) ^-2 [ lxe ] .",
    "we can see that equations ( [ lx ] ) and ( [ lxe ] ) depend only on the observational data of the radio pulsars .",
    "it is particularly interesting and important that both equations above do not depend on details of the sparking gap model @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we have found a simple relationship between the properties of drifting subpulses observed in radio band and the characteristics of x - ray thermal emission from the polar cap heated by sparks associated with these subpulses . for psr b0943@xmath8710 , which is the only pulsar for which",
    "both @xmath88 , ( dr99 ) and @xmath89 , ( zsp05 ) are measured , the above equations hold very well . in few other cases for which the circulational periodicity is measured @xmath90 ( see table  1 ) , which gives @xmath91 . such correlation between the x - ray and the spin - down luminosities is a well - known and intriguing property of rotation powered pulsars @xcite . it has been suggested that this correlation is a characteristic of a magnetospheric radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we suggest that it can also be a characteristic property of the polar cap thermal radiation .",
    "most likely , both mechanisms contribute at a comparable level to the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , one should realize that if the estimates for psrs 0809 + 74 and 0633 + 08 ( table 1 ) were correct , they would violate significantly the above correlation , so it should be treated with caution until confirmed or discarded .    using equations ( [ p3p ] ) and ( [ tsbis ] )",
    "we can write the polar cap temperature in the form t_s=(5.110 ^ 6k)b^1/4 ^ 1/4_-15p^-1/2()^-1/2 [ ts4 ] , where the enhancement coefficient @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath78 ( see section  2 ) .",
    "since @xmath94 can be determined from the black - body fit to the spectrum of the observed thermal x - ray emission , the above equations can also be regarded as independent of details of the sparking gap model and depending only on the combined radio and x - ray data , similarly as equations ( [ lx ] ) and ( [ lxe ] ) .",

    "as already mentioned above , both the subpulse drift rate and the polar cap heating rate ( due to subpulse - producing sparks ) are related to the same value of the accelerating potential drop . in section 3 , we found a `` clear cut '' formula involving two observables : the x - ray luminosity @xmath0 and the tertiary drift periodicity @xmath1 , which is independent of microscopic details of the acceleration region .",
    "this relationship holds very well for psr b0943@xmath8710 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is important to check whether this `` model independent '' approach is consistent with detailed model calculations , involving microscopic conditions prevailing in psg .",
    "according to equations ( [ p3p ] ) and ( [ eta2 ] ) we have the shielding parameter @xmath257 and the complexity parameter @xmath258 , in consistency with gs00 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "let us analyze in this respect our figure  1 , which allows to read off the physical parameters of the acceleration region for a given pulsar within a particular model @xmath61 . for psr b0943@xmath8710 , only the intersections of the vertical lines corresponding to n1=41 ( see table  2 ) with the hatched belts , or even with the horizontal line @xmath259 3mk , are relevant .",
    "the above value of @xmath257 corresponds to the radius of curvature @xmath260 ( see the condition below eq .",
    "[ [ lxe2 ] ] ) , and thus from the lower - right panel of figure  1 we have @xmath261 or @xmath262  g and @xmath243  k. this set of parameters can be also inferred from the upper panel in figure  2 . these values therefore are consistent with the appropriate entry for psr b0943 + 10 in table 1 .",
    "this consistency between macro- and micro - scopic calculations holds also for other pulsars from table 1 , as illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "this set of parameters can be also inferred from the upper panel in figure  2 .",
    "the surface temperature about 3mk ( zsp05 ) , which implies @xmath263  g if one applies j86 theory ( eq .  [ [ tibis ] ] ) to the case of b0943 + 10 .",
    "the value exceeding @xmath264  g may seem extremely high , but at least three radio pulsars have dipolar magnetic fields above @xmath264  g ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the non - dipolar surface magnetic fields could be even stronger .",
    "the reason that the inferred non - dipolar field is even stronger than in the pure vacuum case found in gm02 for the ics seed photons is that we are using a lower binding energy calculations of @xcite , which are more robust than those of @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for critical review ) . however , generally the surface magnetic field required to form cr - ntvg obtained by gm02 is still higher than that for cr - ntpsg obtained in this paper .",
    "in section 3.1 we assumed a pure black - body conditions at the polar cap .",
    "gm02 considered deviations from the black - body conditions by introducing the so - called heat - flow coefficient @xmath265 , which described the amount of heat conducted beneath the polar cap that can not be transferred back to the surface during the spark development time scale ( see appendix  b in gm02 ) .",
    "the heat flow coefficient @xmath266 influenced the required surface magnetic field @xmath15 in proportion to @xmath267 ( for cr case ) .",
    "gm02 argued that for @xmath268  mk this effect could reduce the required @xmath15 by a factor of about 2 .",
    "however , if @xmath269  mk as indicated by the case of psr b0943@xmath8710 , the reduction effect is negligible and we ignored it in this paper .",
    "the phenomenon of drifting subpulses has been widely regarded as a powerful tool for understanding the mechanism of coherent pulsar radio emission . rs75 first proposed that drifting subpulses are related to  drifting sparks discharging the high potential drop within the inner acceleration region above the polar cap .",
    "the subpulse - associated streams of secondary electron - positron plasma created by sparks were penetrated by much faster primary beam .",
    "this system was supposed to undergo a two - stream instability , which should lead to generation of the coherent radiation at radio wave lengths . however , careful calculations of the binding energy ( critical for spark ignition ) and the growth rate of the two - stream instability have shown that neither the sparking discharge nor the two - stream instability were able to work in a way proposed by rs75 . nonetheless , qualitatively their idea was still considered attractive , at least to the authors of this paper who have been continuing efforts to search for mechanisms that would actually make the rs75 model to work . in this paper",
    "we applied the partially screened gap model proposed by gmg03 to psr b0943 + 10 , a famous drifter for which zsp06 successfully attempted to measure the thermal x - ray from hot polar cap .",
    "we derived a simple relationship between the x - ray luminosity @xmath0 from the polar cap heated by sparks and the tertiary periodicity @xmath1 of the spark - associated subpulse drift observed in radio band .",
    "this relationship reflects the fact that both the drifting ( radio ) and the heating ( x - rays ) rates are determined by the same value of the electric field in the partially screened gap . as a consequence of this",
    "coupling equations  ( [ lx ] ) and ( [ lxe ] ) are independent of details of the acceleration region . in psrs b0943@xmath8710 and b1133 + 16 , the only two pulsars for which both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are measured , the predicted relationship between observational quantities holds very well .",
    "we note that @xmath1 is very difficult to measure and its value is known only for four pulsars : b0943@xmath8710 , b1133 + 16 , b0826@xmath9834 and b0834@xmath8706 .",
    "the successful confrontation of the predicted x - ray luminosity with the observations in psrs b0943@xmath8710 and b1133 + 16 encourages further tests of the model with future x - ray observations of other drifting pulsars .",
    "this is particularly relevant to psr b0834@xmath8706 , whose predicted x - ray luminosity is much higher than in psr b0943 + 10 , while the distance to both pulsars is almost identical .",
    "it is worth mentioning that due to relatively poor photon statistics it is still not absolutely clear whether the x - ray radiation associated with polar cap of psr b0943 + 10 is thermal or magnetospheric ( or both ) in origin .",
    "however , the case of geminga pulsar b0633 + 17 strongly supports thermal origin .",
    "observations of psr b0834@xmath8706 with _ xmm - newton _ should help to resolve this question ultimately .    in both the steady sclf model and the pure vacuum gap model , the potential increases with height",
    "quadratically at lower altitudes .",
    "however the growth rate is significantly different - the latter is faster by a factor of @xmath270 .",
    "it is well known that in the pure vacuum case ( rs75 ) , the potential grows so fast that a primary particle could quickly generate pairs with a high multiplicity , and that some backward returning electrons generate more pairs and soon a `` pair avalanche '' occurs and the potential is short out by a spark . in the psg model",
    "we are advocating , the potential drops by a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "for essentially all the cases we are discussing , this @xmath61 value is much larger than the @xmath271 value required for the steady sclf to operate , although it is much less than unity .",
    "the steady state condition is not satisfied , and the the gap is more analogous to a vacuum gap , i.e. the pair discharging happening intermittently .",
    "in fact , the partially screened potential drop is still above the threshold for the magnetic pair production , which in strong and curved surface magnetic field is a condition necessary and sufficient for the sparking breakdown .",
    "the original rs75 pure vg model predicts much too high a subpulse drift rate and an x - ray luminosity to explain the case of psr b0943 + 10 and other similar cases .",
    "other available acceleration models predict too low a luminosity and the explanation of drifting subpulse phenomenon is generally not clear at all ( see zsp05 for more detailed discussion ) . in summary , the bolometric x - ray luminosity for the space charge limited flow @xcite pure vacuum gap ( rs75 ) and partially screened gap ( gmg03 ) is @xmath272 @xcite , @xmath273 ( zsp05 ) , and @xmath274 ( this paper ) , respectively .",
    "the latter model also predicts right  plasma drift rate .",
    "thus , combined radio and x - ray data are consistent only with the partially screened vg model , which requires very strong ( generally non - dipolar ) surface magnetic fields . observations of the hot - spot thermal radiation almost always indicate bolometric polar cap radius much smaller than the canonical goldreich - julian value .",
    "most probably such a significant reduction of the polar cap size is caused by the flux conservation of the non - dipolar surface magnetic fields connecting with the open dipolar magnetic field lines at distances much larger than the neutron star radius .",
    "our analysis suggests the following pulsar picture : in the strong magnetic fields approaching @xmath264  g at the neutron star surface , the binding energy is high enough to prevent a full thermionic flow from the hot polar cap at the corotation limited level .",
    "a partially screened vacuum gap develops with the acceleration potential drop exceeding the threshold for the magnetic pair formation .",
    "the growth of this potential drop should be naturally limited by a number of isolated electron - positron spark discharges . as a consequence",
    ", the polar cap surface is heated by back - flowing particles to temperatures @xmath275  k , just below the critical temperature @xmath3 at which the thermionic flow screens the gap completely .",
    "the typical radii of curvature of the field lines @xmath210 is of the order of polar cap radii @xmath276  cm .",
    "the only parameter that is thermostatically adjusted in a given pulsar is the shielding parameter @xmath277 , which determines the actual level of charge depletion with respect to the pure vacuum case ( @xmath61=1 ) , and in consequence the polar cap heating rate as well as the spark drifting rate .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that @xmath278 for longer period pulsars @xmath279 s and @xmath280 for shorter period pulsars .",
    "our calculations are consistent with psr b0943@xmath8710 and few other drifting pulsars , for which the signatures of x - ray emission from the hot polar cap were detected .",
    "the sparks operating at the polar cap generate streams of secondary electron - positron plasma flowing through the magnetosphere .",
    "these streams are likely to generate beams of coherent radio emission that can be observed in the form of subpulses .",
    "@xcite first pointed out that the non - stationarity associated with sparking discharges naturally leads to a two - stream instability as the result of mutual penetration between the slower and the faster plasma components .",
    "@xcite developed this idea further , calculated the growth rates , and demonstrated that the instability is very efficient in generating langmuir plasma waves at distances of many stellar radii @xmath281 cm , where @xmath282 is the height of the acceleration region described by equation ( 21 ) @xcite .",
    "this is exactly where pulsar s radio emission is supposed to originate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "conversion of these waves into coherent electromagnetic radiation escaping from the pulsar magnetosphere was considered and discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors demonstrated that the nonlinear evolution of langmuir oscillations developing in pulsar s magnetosphere leads to formation of charged , relativistic solitons , able to emit coherent curvature radiation at radio wavelengths .",
    "the component of this radiation that is polarized perpendicularly to the planes of dipolar magnetic field can escape from the magnetosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for observational evidence of such polarization of pulsar radiation ) .",
    "the observed pulsar radiation in this picture is an indirect consequence of sparking discharges within the inner acceleration region just above the polar cap . in light of this paper",
    "we can therefore argue that the coherent pulsar radio emission is conditional on the presence of strong non - dipolar surface magnetic fields at the polar cap , with a strength about @xmath283  g and radius of curvature of the order @xmath284  cm .    in the very strong surface magnetic field assumed within the accelerator , processes such as photon splitting @xcite and bound pair creation @xcite",
    "may become important .",
    "it has been suggested that such processes could potentially delay pair creation and thus increase the height and voltage of the accelerator . for the photon splitting case ,",
    "the delay is significant only if photons with both polarization modes split - a hypothesis in strong magnetic fields @xcite . it could be possible that only one mode split @xcite .",
    "in such a case the gap height and potential of a psg would not be significantly affected due to the high pair multiplicity in strong , curved magnetic fields . for bound pairs @xcite , in the very hot environment near the neutron star surface ( with temperatures exceeding 1 mk ) , it is possible that bound pairs could not survive long from photoionization .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite one can roughly estimate the mean free path for bound pair photo - ionization .",
    "it turns out that for temperatures around ( 2 - 3 ) mk this mean free path is of the order of few meters , which is considerably less than the height of cr - driven psg . in such a case , even if the bound pairs are initially produced , they would not significantly delay the pair formation .",
    "one could address this potential potential problem by referring to the detailed case study of psr b0943 + 10 analyzed in this paper .",
    "this is the only pulsar in which we have full information concerning  drift rate and the polar cap heating rate . in the analysis we have used two methods .",
    "the first method is independent on details of accelerating region ( such as height , potential drop , etc . ) but is based only on the subpulse drift radio - data ( eqs .",
    "[ [ lx],[lxe ] ] ) .",
    "the second one includes the detailed treatments of model parameters without considering the delaying effect by photon splitting and bound pairs ( eqs .",
    "[ [ ts],[lxe2 ] ] ) .",
    "both methods give consistent results , as illustrated in figures ( 1 - 4 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the delaying processes , if any , are not significant in the psgs given the physical conditions we invoke . finally , we note that @xcite presented a model of the inner accelerator that shares some similar features with our model , although it is basically different . in their model",
    "the potential drop is self - regulated by partial screening close to the threshold for field ionization of bound pairs , so the surface temperature is maintained at the level necessary for this screening . in our model ,",
    "the partial screening keeps the surface temperature slightly below the critical temperature at which the thermionic flow is space charge limited @xcite . in the light of results presented in this paper",
    "we claim that bound pairs do not affect the formation of inner accelerators in pulsars .",
