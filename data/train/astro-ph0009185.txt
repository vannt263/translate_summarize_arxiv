    "the disk fraction decreases dramatically with age and is much less than 10% for stars with ages of @xmath2 yr ( gyr hereafter ) or larger .    because thermal emission from cold dust is large compared to the photospheric radiation from the central star ,",
    "most debris disks have been detected with mid - infrared or far - infrared observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "infrared and optical images reveal a disk - like morphology with an outer radius ranging from 100200 au up to 1000 au in several systems ( @xcite , 1999b ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the disk often has a central ` hole , ' where radiation from small dust grains is less than emission from material in the outer disk .",

    "theoretical models for a debris disk begin with dust grains in keplerian orbits about the central star ( see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) . for particle sizes of 1100 , poynting - robertson drag and radiation pressure remove dust from the disk in @xmath9 110 myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; backman , dasgupta , & stencel 1995 ; @xcite ) .",
    "collisions between larger bodies can replenish small grains if the collision velocity is @xmath0 100300 m s@xmath10 ( see below ) .",
    "these large velocities initiate a `` collisional cascade , '' where planetesimals with radii of 110 km are ground down into smaller and smaller bodies .",
    "a collisional cascade requires a mass reservoir of @xmath0 10100 @xmath7 to replenish smaller grains over a disk lifetime of 100 myr or more ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this mass is similar to estimates for the original planetesimal mass in the kuiper belt of our solar system ( e.g. , @xcite , 1996 ; kenyon & luu 1998 [ kl98 ] , 1999 [ kl99 ] ) .    despite the popularity of this picture , the origin of the large collision velocities is uncertain . because the difference between the gas velocity and dust velocity is small and circularization is efficient , dust grains and larger bodies within a protosolar nebula probably had nearly circular orbits initially ( see kl99 and references therein ) .",
    "short - term encounters with passing stars and stirring by planets embedded in the disk can increase the velocities of dust grains ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although stellar encounters can increase particle velocities enormously , such encounters are probably rare .",
    "collisions of bodies within the disk may also effectively damp large velocities following the encounter ; kl99 estimate damping times of 110 myr for 1100 m objects during the early stages of planetesimal growth in the kuiper belt .",
    "stirring by embedded planets is attractive , because objects with radii of 1000 km or more naturally form in the disk and these objects continuously stir up the velocities of small dust grains .",
    "the timescale to reach the large collision velocities required in many debris disks is uncertain .",
    "kenyon ( 1999 ) show that pluto - sized objects can form within the dusty ring of hr4796 a and stir up the velocities of smaller objects in @xmath0 10 myr if the disk is sufficiently massive .",
    "gravitational stirring may be less efficient in lower mass disks ( kl99 ) and in the outer portions of the debris disks of @xmath11 pic and other systems .",
    "our goal is to investigate the physical conditions needed in a planetary debris disk for embedded planets to stir up smaller objects to the shattering velocity .",
    "we use a new multi - annulus planetesimal evolution code to compute the dynamical evolution of small bodies and show that results for simple test problems agree with previous calculations .",
    "our calculations for debris disks with masses comparable to the ` minimum mass solar nebula ' indicate that small bodies with radii of 200 km or less can stir much smaller bodies in the disk on timescales of 1 gyr or longer .",
    "shorter stirring timescales require larger objects and more massive disks",
    ". objects with radii of 500 km or larger can stir low mass planetesimals to the shattering limit in disks with 510 times the mass of a minimum mass solar nebula in 1020 myr , close to the inferred ages for @xmath11 pic and hr 4796a ( @xcite , 1999 ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "thus , a disk composed primarily of planetesimals of a single size can not undergo a collisional cascade on a timescale of 1 gyr or smaller .",
    "an obvious and more realistic alternative to this model is a disk composed of objects with a large range of sizes .",
    "a set of 100 km bodies can effectively stir up smaller objects on timescales comparable to self - stirring models .",

    "we label each curve in the figure with the mass spacing factor @xmath129 .",
    "models with better mass resolution take longer to reach the shattering limit . because each model has the same @xmath130 , models with finer mass resolution have fewer of the largest bodies than models with coarse mass resolution .",
    "thus , our computational procedure produces smaller stirring rates in more finely spaced grids .",
    "the difference in the velocity of small particles at 100 myr as a function of mass spacing is modest : @xmath107 decreases from @xmath0 190 m s@xmath10 for @xmath129 = @xmath118 to @xmath0 144 m s@xmath10 for @xmath129 = 5.6 and @xmath0 132 m s@xmath10 for @xmath129 = 2 .      in this paper , we have begun to address some of the limitations and uncertainties of statistical calculations of planetesimal growth in a solar nebula ( see kl98 and kl99 for a summary of these limitations ) .",
    "our multi - annulus code should provide a better treatment of velocity evolution within the nebula , because we calculate short - range and long - range stirring using an evolving density of planetesimals at each radius within the grid .",
    "uncertainties due to the finite spatial resolution and the finite extent of the full grid are small ( figures 34 , 67 , and 9 ) .",

    "partial disk models with large bodies , @xmath131 200 km , have larger uncertainties than models with small bodies , @xmath132 200 km .",
    "particle velocities are also sensitive to the mass resolution of the grid ( figure 8) , but the errors are @xmath133 50% for any mass resolution , @xmath134 .",
    "larger errors are possible when the calculations include mergers and fragmentation ( see kl98 , kl99 , and references therein ) .",
    "we plan to examine this issue for the multi - annulus evolution code in a future paper .",
    "our conclusions concerning the long term evolution of particle velocities are probably insensitive to our neglect of important physical processes , such as mergers with fragmentation and radiative processes such as poynting - robertson drag .",
    "the timescale to produce 1001000 km objects in a solar nebula is generally short compared to the stirring time ( kl99 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our assumption of an initial population of 100500 km objects therefore does not lead to a large uncertainty in the stirring timescale .",
    "previous calculations have also shown that collisions tend to redistribute kinetic energy from the larger bodies to the smaller bodies ( kl99 ) . including this process in the calculations would probably reduce stirring times by 25% to 50% .",
    "calculations with the better mass resolution needed to follow mergers and fragmentation tend to increase stirring times by a similar factor ( figure 8) .",
    "thus , a more accurate treatment with better mass resolution which includes mergers and fragmentation will probably yield stirring times close to those derived here .",
    "our neglect of processes which remove particles from the grid probably also has little impact on the derived stirring timescales .",
    "gas drag removes few of the 1 km objects needed for the collisional cascade and has negligible impact on their velocities ( kl99 ) .",
    "poynting - robertson drag and ejection by radiation pressure are important for small particles once the collisional cascade begins ( @xcite ; backman , dasgupta , & stencel 1995 ) .",
    "we have concentrated on the evolution leading up to the collisional cascade and plan to consider the cascade itself in a future paper .",
    "finally , our stirring timescales are upper limits for debris disks containing larger objects with radii exceeding 1000 km . estimating stirring timescales for these objects using the approach in this paper is difficult , because the growth rate of large objects is comparable to the stirring timescale in the outer disk ( kl99 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the statistical approach used for these calculations also begins to break down when the most massive objects are few in number , although weidenschilling ( 1997 ) note that the stirring rates for one large body are remarkably close to those derived from complete @xmath135-body calculations ( see the appendix ) .",
    "our approach also does not include orbital resonances , which become important for planets with masses much larger than those considered here .",
    "we suspect that the stirring timescales for objects with radii of 10003000 km will roughly follow the scaling laws described in  3.3 , but can not confirm this hypothesis without a more sophisticated calculation .",
    "we conclude that our stirring times are reasonably accurate estimates for a debris disk containing a mass distribution of modest - sized planets and planetesimals with @xmath136 500 km .",
    "future calculations including coagulation and shattering will yield predicted surface density distributions for the dust in a model disk . in the stirring calculations described here",
    ", we adopt an initial surface density distribution @xmath137 which remains fixed with time .",
    "surface density distributions derived from observations range from @xmath138 ( e.g. , wilner 2000 ) to @xmath139 ( e.g. , trilling 2000 ) .",
    "tests with different surface density distributions suggest that the radial velocity gradient becomes flatter as the surface density distribution becomes shallower .",
    "we thus expect larger velocities and larger scale heights in disks with more mass at larger distances from the central star .",
    "the exponent in the radial surface density distribution may well evolve with time , because the timescales to produce large planets in the disk is a strong function of heliocentric distance ( @xcite ) .",
    "our simple models do not explain isolated features observed in debris disks such as gaps , warps , and other asymmetries . gaps and",
    "perhaps warps are a natural outcome of large planet formation in the disk ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the size of the gap surrounding a large planet with mass @xmath140 is roughly 510 hill radii , where @xmath141 ( see the appendix and references therein ) .",

    "large bodies stir up small bodies to large velocities ; collisions between smaller bodies initiate the collisional cascade . in our calculations with equal mass per mass bin , the disk must be at least as massive as a minimum mass solar nebula and contain objects with radii of 500 km or larger .",
    "larger objects in massive disks stir the velocities of small planetesimals more effectively than smaller objects in less massive disks .",
