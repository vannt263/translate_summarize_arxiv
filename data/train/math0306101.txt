    "in @xcite , odlyzko and schnhage developed an algorithm to compute the riemann zeta function @xmath2 efficiently for values of @xmath3 very high up in the critical strip .",
    "their method depends on precomputation of taylor series expansions of @xmath2 at regularly spaced points , which in turn can be done efficiently by a clever application of the fast fourier transform .",
    "rumely later implemented a version of this for dirichlet @xmath0-functions in @xcite .    in analytic number theory",
    "it is often the case that there is a symmetry between what one can prove for large values of @xmath4 in the critical strip , and what one can prove for @xmath0-functions with large conductor @xmath5 . with this in mind",
    ", it seems reasonable to try to find an algorithm to efficiently compute values of @xmath0-functions with very large conductor .",
    "roughly speaking , we want to view the @xmath0-function as a mellin transform of an automorphic form @xmath6 , and split the integral at the symmetry point . this gives the extended @xmath0-function as an infinite sum @xmath7 of values of an incomplete gamma function @xmath8 it was already observed in @xcite that the rapid decay of @xmath9 as @xmath10 means that we can truncate the infinite series at about @xmath11 terms . on the other hand ,",
    "the exponential decay as @xmath4 increases will cause a loss of precision if we want to compute @xmath0-function values for large @xmath12 .",
    "this can be fixed by moving the contour integral so that the @xmath13 parameter has complex values , as observed in @xcite and @xcite and implemented in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on computing taylor series expansions of the function @xmath9 in the _ second _ variable .",
    "differentiation under the integral sign and integration by parts gives a recursion which allows the computations of derivatives of @xmath9 at very little cost .",
    "the rapid decay of @xmath9 as @xmath13 increases will imply that , instead of taking equally spaced points for the centers of the taylor expansions , the sequence of points can grow exponentially .",
    "this , in turn , will imply that we need very few taylor expansions to compute efficiently , in fact @xmath14 expansions with @xmath14 terms in each .",
    "however , too much change in @xmath12 will require that we increase the phase in the @xmath13 parameters , and then all taylor expansions must be recomputed .",
    "for that reason , we will only consider @xmath15 in this paper , although the method will generalize to any bounded region in the critical strip .",
    "for further simplification we will consider only @xmath16 on the critical line , although this , too , is not crucial .    if we want to get the most benefit of the precomputations it makes sense to compute zeros of lots of @xmath0-functions with the same conductor simultaneously . here",
    "the power of the fast fourier transform can again play a role , if all of the @xmath0-functions arise from the same abelian group structure . in this paper",
    "we will focus primarily on @xmath0-functions attached to characters @xmath17 on the ideal class group of a complex quadratic field with discriminant @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding automorphic forms are weight one forms , which are cusp forms if the character @xmath17 is not a genus character .",
    "the corresponding galois representations are dihedral .",
    "( the final section of the paper , however , includes an example of an elliptic curve @xmath0-function with large conductor , and of an @xmath0-function for a quadratic dirichlet character for large discriminant . )    with this in mind we now explain the algorithm in a little more detail .",
    "it will be convenient to use the correspondence between ideal classes and binary quadratic forms @xmath19 of discriminant @xmath18 .",
    "corresponding to a character @xmath17 we have a theta function @xmath20}\\phi(q)\\sum_{n>0}r_q(n)\\exp(2\\pi inz)\\overset{\\text{def.}}=\\sum_{n>0}r_\\phi(n)\\exp(2\\pi inz).\\ ] ] then @xmath21 ( see @xcite or @xcite . ) for purposes of locating zeros on the critical line it is better to compute the hardy function @xmath22 defined for @xmath23 by @xmath24 and , with @xmath16 , @xmath25 we will truncate the infinite series after @xmath26 terms , and arrange the @xmath27 into intervals @xmath28 , @xmath29 centered at points @xmath30 and with width @xmath31 . for @xmath32 in the interval",
    "@xmath28 we compute a taylor series expansion , truncated to @xmath33 terms @xmath34 where @xmath35 this gives @xmath22 as @xmath36 here we have inserted canceling terms @xmath37 , @xmath38 to control the small size of @xmath39 and the large size of @xmath40 .    the point ,",
    "then , is that the inner sum over @xmath41 is independent of @xmath3 , and so can be done as a precomputation .",
    "of course , this is done separately for each character @xmath17 , but the coefficients @xmath42 can be computed for all characters @xmath17 very efficiently via the fast fourier transform once the representation numbers @xmath43 are known .    if we want to use this method for other kinds of @xmath0-functions , for example , the @xmath0-function of an elliptic curve , or a quadratic dirichlet character , we forgo the advantage of using the fast fourier transform",
    ". however , we see below we can choose the parameters @xmath30 to be an integer times ( a constant analogous to ) @xmath44 , so that the precomputation can even be done with _ integer _",
    "arithmetic when the coefficients @xmath45 are integers .",
    "the @xmath37 terms are simply omitted , and the ( analog of the ) @xmath46 term is factored out of the inner sum .",
    "the author would like to thank kimberly hopkins for help with this idea .",
    "the remaining sections of the paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "review of properties of @xmath9 .",
    "truncation of the @xmath0-series after @xmath26 terms . 3 .",
    "arrangement of the taylor expansions .",
    "the @xmath47 intervals @xmath48 are determined .",
    "truncation of the taylor expansions after @xmath33 terms .",
    "implementation and examples .",
    "as above we define for @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51 differentiating with respect to @xmath13 under the integral we see that @xmath52 integration by parts , on the other hand , gives @xmath53 equations ( [ eq : diffintegral ] ) and ( [ eq : intbyparts ] ) give a nice recursive relation for all the derivatives @xmath54 in terms of @xmath9",
    ".    we will need bounds for @xmath9 and its derivatives . for @xmath3 in the critical strip , that is @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 change the variables by @xmath57 to get @xmath58 now @xmath59 and by hypothesis , @xmath60 , so @xmath61 , and therefore @xmath62 this method does not apply , since we only have @xmath63 .",
    "instead we can use the cauchy formula for derivatives @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a bound for @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "an estimate similar to ( [ eq : biggbound ] ) shows that @xmath68 , which a calculus argument shows is maximized at @xmath69 , that is , @xmath70 for any @xmath71 .",
    "to compute to @xmath72 digits of accuracy , we need enough terms @xmath26 in the @xmath0-series so that @xmath73 since the @xmath42 are the coefficients of a weight one cusp form , @xmath74 . using ( [ eq : biggbound ] ) , the left side of ( [ eq : trunc1 ] ) is @xmath75 for this to be less than @xmath76 we need @xmath77 it suffices that @xmath78",
    "we seek to find intervals of radius @xmath31 centered at @xmath30 and bounding circles of radius @xmath79 so that @xmath80 the tail of the taylor expansion @xmath81 where @xmath39 is as in ( [ eq : defgjk ] ) .",
    "one might wish to minimize the total number of terms in all the taylor expansions , but this seems intractable . instead we will simply choose the truncation parameter @xmath33 to be independent of @xmath82 . to make this",
    "happen we require that @xmath83 furthermore , in order that the endpoints of the intervals meet , we require that @xmath84 this gives @xmath85 so @xmath86 thus @xmath87 now @xmath88 and @xmath89 implies that @xmath90 for simplicity we choose the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 which gives @xmath93 and @xmath94    the simplest choice for @xmath95 is @xmath44 .",
    "this gives @xmath96.\\ ] ] observe that @xmath97 contains only the @xmath98 term , @xmath99 contains only the @xmath100 term , @xmath101 contains only @xmath102 , etc .",
    "thus for the very small values of @xmath82 where the intervals contain fewer than @xmath33 terms one can do better computing each term instead of using the taylor expansion .",
    "this would improve the efficiency about 40% for @xmath5 near @xmath103 , 30% near @xmath104 , and 20% near @xmath105 .",
    "we can now determine how many intervals @xmath47 are needed , since we need to compute terms in the series out to @xmath106 so @xmath107 this requires that @xmath108 with @xmath109 we want @xmath110 or @xmath111 with @xmath112 we can simply choose @xmath113",
    "suppose we make error @xmath114 in computing @xmath115 using the bound @xmath116 for @xmath42 and the rough estimate @xmath117 for @xmath26 , the maximal error we make in the sum for @xmath22 is bounded by @xmath118 alternatively we can consider the standard error , assuming the errors in the terms are independent with standard deviation @xmath119 .",
    "then the standard error in the sum is bounded by @xcite @xmath120 we will assume the latter from now on .",
    "we want @xmath121 , or @xmath122 which will determine how many terms @xmath33 we need to take in each taylor expansion .",
    "it follows from the choice made in  3 that @xmath123 thus the tail ( [ eq : taylortail ] ) of the taylor series reduces to @xmath124 again , with @xmath109 we combine ( [ eq : epsdef ] ) and ( [ eq : epsbnd ] ) to find that we require @xmath125 since @xmath126 we ignore it , and so we need @xmath127 and let @xmath128 even under the assumption of maximal error we would still only need @xmath129 .",
    "to implement this algorithm requires the computation of reduced representatives of all the forms , as well as their coordinates in terms of the generators of the cyclic factors of the class group .",
    "this computation is clearly @xmath11 .",
    "we then need to evaluate all the forms @xmath130 on a rectangular grid of integer lattice points @xmath131 , large enough not to miss any representation of any integer @xmath27 .",
    "determining the dimensions of the grid is a lagrange multipliers problem ; we must maximize @xmath132 ( respectively @xmath133 ) subject to the constraint @xmath134 one finds @xmath135 since the forms are reduced , the inequalities on @xmath136 and @xmath137 and our choice ( [ eq : bignchoice ] ) of @xmath26 imply @xmath138 we have triple @xmath139 for each lattice point , which are the rows of a @xmath140 matrix .",
    "evaluation of the all the forms at all the lattice points consists of multiplying the above matrix by the @xmath141 matrix of form data .",
    "this is @xmath142 multiplications ( in terms of @xmath5 , for a fixed number @xmath72 of digits of accuracy . )        for each character @xmath17 , the precomputation of the sums @xmath146 takes @xmath147 operations , which is @xmath148 by ( [ eq : bignchoice ] ) and ( [ eq : bigbchoice ] ) .",
    "subsequently , evaluations of @xmath22 using ( [ eq : thm ] ) require only @xmath149 operations , which is @xmath150 by ( [ eq : bigtchoice ] ) and ( [ eq : bigbchoice ] ) .",

    "* a.9.4 ) , via decomposition of the length of lists of data into prime factors . for large factors ,",
    "fast convolution methods are used . since",

    "non - cyclic abelian groups are handled automatically .",

    "the accuracy of the algorithm was checked by computing , to 15 digits , the zeros of some genus character @xmath0-functions . by genus theory , these are products of dirichlet @xmath0-functions attached to quadratic characters .",
    "these zeros were first computed directly , writing the dirichlet @xmath0-function as a linear combination of hurwitz zeta functions ( also supported in _ mathematica _ ) .",
    "the zeros were also compared to the data in @xcite , and agreed to the number of digits given .",
