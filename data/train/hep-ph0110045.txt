    "one of the interesting possibilities which open up in theories with more than four spacetime dimensions is to explain the misterious pattern of fermion mass hierarchies @xcite . in previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have shown how a single family of fermions , with vectorlike couplings to the standard model group @xmath0 in 6 dimensions was reduced to @xmath1 _ chiral _ families in 4 dimensions .",
    "this mechanism hinged on a localisation on a vortex in the `` transverse '' dimensions , characterized by a winding number @xmath1 . as a variant , an effective vortex achieving the same result",
    "could be simulated by coupling the fermions to a winding - number 1 scalar elevated to the @xmath1th power .",
    "the value @xmath2 is not favoured in such schemes , and was only invoked for its phenomenological interest .",
    "we also showed how a relatively simple scalar structure ( the usual higgs doublet @xmath3 , supplemented by the vortex - defining field @xmath4 ) suffices to generate the mass hierarchy of the @xmath1 families , while an auxiliary field @xmath5 could be used to generate a mixing taking place mostly between adjacent generations .",
    "the key to the construction is that interaction with a vortex with winding number @xmath1 leads , by the index theorem @xcite , to @xmath1 chiral zero modes in four dimensions , and this for each fermion species coupled to the structure .",
    "we now return to this construction and pay special attention to the case of neutrinos . the simplest attitude ( which was in a way implicit in the previous papers )",
    "would be to treat neutrinos just like the other fermions , that is to include both left- and right - handed fields , say @xmath6 and @xmath7 in four dimensions , and to generalize them to six dimensions .",
    "dirac masses and mixings are then obtained just like those of the charged fermions .",
    "there is nothing fundamental against this approach , except the very small value of the ratio between neutrino and charged fermion masses ( typically less than @xmath8 )",
    ". this would require severe fine tuning , either directly at the level of the yukawa couplings themselves , or in a more covert fashion through a more complicated scalar structure ( see footnote below ) .",
    "we therefore try to explore other ways of getting small neutrino masses .",
    "it has become standard practice @xcite in the context of extra ( flat and compactified ) dimensions , to assume that right - handed neutrions , being gauge singlets , could propagate in the `` bulk '' of space , escaping confinement .",
    "this is of course possible since such particles do not participate directly in the gauge interactions , and therefore do not affect ( at least at tree level , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) the behaviour of electroweak exchanges .",
    "in such a context , the smallness of the neutrino mass stems not from artficially tuned yukawa couplings , but from the severely reduced overlap between the confined and `` bulk '' wave functions .",
    "could such a strategy work here ?",
    "the transcription of such a mechanism in our context involves the introduction of a six - dimensional fermion field , @xmath7 , uncoupled to the vortex field @xmath4 .",
    "this however is in general not sufficient , if the two - dimensional transverse space stays unbounded ( a point which we did not really need to specify this far , since the vortex achieved in any case the localisation of physical fields in a four - dimensional tube ) . using @xmath9 and @xmath10 as variables to describe the two extra dimensions , we should now require @xmath11 , while keeping @xmath12 , to avoid perturbing the previous construction . is this step sufficient ? in principle , if @xmath13 were close to the expected light neutrino mass scale ( say a fraction of an ev ) , we would have a whole set of kaluza - klein towers at hand , each with relatively light states to couple to the @xmath1 left - handed neutrinos .",
    "this line is however somewhat dangerous , since it may lead to a conflict with data on the evolution of supernovae @xcite .",
    "we will avoid this situation by requesting @xmath14 .",
    "for simplicity we may even take @xmath15  gev .",
    "this further requirement however leads us to a pecular situation : we may not have enough light `` right - handed '' partners to provide masses to the @xmath1 neutrinos ! indeed , we typically expect only one fundamental mode of zero mass .",
    "introducing @xmath1 such fermions would of course solve the problem , but would be in opposition to the approach , where at least the charged family multiplication simply results from the topological structure .",
    "fortunately , even with the simplest use of one @xmath7 field , we get easily two light states ( this is a funciton of the chosen charge assignements , see below ) , leaving only @xmath16 degenerate massless @xmath17 states .",
    "since one strictly massless neutrino is no problem ( only differences in masses squared are tested this far ) , the neutrino degeneracy is thus solved for @xmath18 .    the scheme presented below uses one extra scalar field to match quantum numbers and generate the neutrino masses .",
    "it is of course also possible to induce mixing terms , but these are probably redundant , since off - diagonal terms are already allowed for in the charged leptons sector .",
    "if different fermionic modes have different wave function profiles in extra dimensions , then their overlaps with the higgs wave function may produce hierarchical structure of masses and mixings @xcite . in the class of models @xcite ,",
    "each multi - dimensional fermion develops three chiral zero modes localized on a four - dimensional brane due to topological properties of the brane background .",
    "the index theorem guarantees that the three zero modes are linearly independent , and thus have different profiles in extra dimensions .",
    "analysis of the equations for these zero modes demonstrates that a hierarchy in the mass matrix indeed appears due to overlaps of the wave functions . for the discussion of this mechanism and comparison with other approaches ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite throughout the paper .",
    "we will work in a specific realisation of this approach which was suggested in ref .",
    "the model is formulated in six dimensions , and the brane is an abelian vortex made of the gauge field of @xmath19 gauge group and a scalar field @xmath4 .",
    "field content of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is given in table  1 for easy reference    .field content of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite ( scalars and leptons only ) . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with these charge assignements , we can write down two interaction terms , y_1 hs|l1-_72n , [ n7 * ] and y_2 hs^*|l1+_72n .",
    "[ n7 * * ] substituting zero modes of @xmath20 and @xmath7 , one gets the effective lagrangian @xmath21 since @xmath3 and @xmath22 have no @xmath9 dependence in their classical profiles , the integral over @xmath9 is non - zero for @xmath23 ( the first term ) and @xmath24 ( the second ) .",
    "thus , the modes @xmath25 and @xmath26 are paired in the mass matrix .",
    "the masses are given by integrals @xmath27 where the norm @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "masses of @xmath30 and @xmath31 differ only by yukawa couplings @xmath32 in two terms .",
    "two notes are in order .",
    "first , would we add another scalar with the same quantum numbers as @xmath22 but with winding number 1 , we would receive a more complicated mass matrix ( mixing would appear in the neutrino sector as well as in the sector of charged leptons ) , but not the mass for the third neutrino  because we have only two right - handed weyl spinors , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , available .",
    "one linear combination of @xmath35 would still be massless .",
    "second , the eqs .",
    "( [ n7 * ] ) , ( [ n7 * * ] ) mix @xmath35 with nonzero modes of @xmath7 as well .",
    "however , to satisfy simultaneously constraints from weak charge universality and from supernova 1987a , these mixings should be negligible .",
    "in order to count parameters and to estimate the scales involved in the model , we make use of the `` step higgs '' approximation ( full numerical analysis will be presented elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , recall that in six dimensions , a scalar field has dimension ( mass)@xmath36 and a fermion field has dimension ( mass)@xmath37 .",
    "this means that the transverse part of the fermion , described by @xmath38 , has dimension ( mass)@xmath39 ( four - dimensional spinors , denoted by letters in bold face , are of course ( mass)@xmath40 ) .",
    "dimensions of coupling constants are @xmath41={\\rm ( mass)}^{-3}$ ] , @xmath42={\\rm ( mass)}^{-5}$ ] , @xmath43={\\rm ( mass)}^{-1}$ ] , @xmath44={\\rm ( mass)}^{-2}$ ] .",
    "the fundamental dimensionful parameters of the theory are the vortex scale @xmath45 ( in theories where large extra dimensions are invoked to reformulate the gauge hierarchy problem , @xmath45 is of order multi - dimensional planck mass ) , and the compactification scale @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the parameters of the theory : @xmath46 tilded coupling constants @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are dimensionless , while @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 have dimension ( mass)@xmath39 .    in the narrow higgs approximation",
    ", @xmath54 can be substituted by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the width of @xmath54 which is supposed to be smaller than widths of other profiles .",
    "then , we can use the following approximations for @xmath57 : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 the coefficients at @xmath61 in fermionic radial functions are determined , approximately , in ref .  @xcite . for the scalar fields",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath22 , the boundary conditions at @xmath62 are @xmath63 , etc . ; so that @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are to be determined by solving the full nonlinear system @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are coefficients of order one , @xmath72 depends non - trivially on @xmath73 and @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath73 and @xmath45 are independent parameters of the lagrangian , @xmath72 does not need to be very close to @xmath45 , though we do not wish them to differ too much in order to avoid fine tuning of the parameters .",
    "diagonal elements of the mass matrix of charged leptons are , to this approximation , @xmath74 where @xmath75 should be sufficiently small to provide the mass hierarchy between three generations .",
    "smallness of @xmath76 exactly corresponds to the fact that @xmath54 is more narrow than @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "non - diagonal mass matrix elements are estimated in a similar way , taking into account the behaviour of @xmath79 at small @xmath10 : @xmath80 the result is that @xmath81 where generation - independent constant @xmath82 this corresponds to the mass matrix of charged leptons m_em_0e (    ccc 1&0&0 + & /2&0",
    "+ 0&/2&^2/3    ) , [ 4.3 * ] where the overall constant @xmath83 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain , to the same approximation , the neutrino mass matrix @xmath84 where @xmath85 and we rescaled , as before , @xmath86 .",
    "the matrix is @xmath87 because we have only two light right - handed modes , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "thus , up to dimensionless constants of order one , the neutrino mass scale is suppressed by a factor of @xmath88 with respect to the mass scale of charged fermions , @xmath89 .",
    "one can have simultaneously @xmath90  gev , @xmath91  ev , and planck mass relation @xmath92  gev satisfied for @xmath93  tev , @xmath94  tev , @xmath95  mm .    in our model , neutrino mass matrix does not contain mixings . in the sector of charged leptons , however , mixing appears , see eq .",
    "( [ 4.3 * ] ) .",
    "three parameters @xmath96 , @xmath76 , and @xmath97 , determine the masses of three charged leptons ; one can fit known values of @xmath98 with @xmath99  mev , @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "the latter value means that mixing is not negligible in the leptonic sector . since all leptonic mixings appear in eq .",
    "( [ 4.3 * ] ) , our model * predicts * values of the neutrino mixing angles which are implicitly determined by masses of charged leptons . in usual notations , they correspond to @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 . on the other hand , values of two @xmath105",
    "are predicted only by the order of magnitude since they depend on unknown constants @xmath106 .",
    "in a class of multidimensional models with one vector - like fermionic family , the low - energy effective theory describes three chiral families in four dimensions .",
    "hierarchy of fermionic masses appears without fine tuning of parameters . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that nondegenerate neutrino masses can be incorporated in a model of this class with the help of only one multidimensional dirac fermion .",

    "this would open an interesting possibility of having three massless neutrinos and explaining observed neutrino anomalies by mixing with kaluza - klein modes only ( this would lead to a nonconventional pattern of oscillations , as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the frameworks of a toy model ) . however , this possibility is in contradiction with bounds on mixing with kaluza - klein states from supernova evolution .",

    "it seems the most promising to have a finite volume in the case of warped transverse dimensions .",
    "particularly interesting is the fact that there exist six - dimensional solutions with gravity localized on an abelian vortex , ref .",
    "these six - dimensional solutions provide also a natural framework for the localization of gauge fields at weak coupling , thus opening the way to fully realistic and calculable models .",
