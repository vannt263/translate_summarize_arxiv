    "accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are believed to be the source engines of enormous radiative power of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shapes of accretion disks  flat or warped  depend on the orientation of the angular momentum of gas fueling from the circumnuclear region with respect to the rotating orientation of the central black hole .",
    "a wide variety of evidence have indicated that in many circumstances these two orientations are misaligned .",
    "first , the orientation of agns seems uncorrelated with that of their host galaxies , well established by observations ( @xcite ) and also confirmed by numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this suggests that gas channeled onto the central smbh either loses the memory of its initial direction in the host galaxy or comes from outside the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , most likely due to galaxy mergers ( @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the current hierarchical framework of galaxy formation and evolution predicts that repeat galaxy mergers , in addition to secular evolution , trigger smbh activities ( e.g. , @xcite ) and gas accretion plausibly proceeds at episodic and random phases ( in particular for minor mergers ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thirdly , recent studies on smbh spin through quantifying the radiative efficiency of agn populations under the thin accretion disk model showed that smbh spin undergoes a decline with cosmic time sine @xmath0 ( @xcite ) , potentially implying that ( partially ) random accretion takes place ( @xcite ) . such evolutionary behavior has also been reproduced by @xcite in their semi - analytic model of smbh growth and evolution ( see their figure 10 ) .    once gas fueling is inclined with respect to the central spinning black hole , a warped accretion disk forms inevitably .",
    "the lense - thirring torque arising from the frame dragging effect will lead to precessions of the inclined accretion disk and the black hole around each other .",
    "detailed dynamics of warped accretion disks has been studied extensively through theoretical analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) and numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the intensive applications of warped accretion disks lie at their critical role on shaping the spin of the central smbhs through the bardeen - petterson effect ( @xcite ) . in this effect ,",
    "the presence of strong viscosity , a most like case for normal agns , damps out the differential lense - thirring precession and induce the inner portion of the disk to align or anti - align with the spin axis of the hole .",
    "accompanied with warp propagation , the entire disk will tend to align or anti - align with the hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies on the alignments between black holes and their warped accretion disks mainly focus on two aspects .",
    "the first assumes that accretion disks have infinite extensions and constant profiles .",
    "black holes are always driven toward the disks and the black hole - disk systems end up alignments ( @xcite ) . on the contrary , the second assumes that accretion disks are finite in both size and mass and the total angular momentum of the systems is conserved ( @xcite ) , which means that there is no gas supply to the disks .",
    "such systems can end up a configuration of either alignment or anti - alignment , depending on the initial inclinations and the ratios of the angular momenta between disks and black holes ( @xcite ) .    in reality",
    ", it is well known that accretion disks are truncated by their own self - gravity in the outer regions where it becomes dominated over the gravity from black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . outside the truncation radius ,",
    "the disks fragment into dense clumps and finally turn to be a hotbed of star formations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it comes naturally that the stellar radiation and supernova explosions feedback to the ambient gas , exciting turbulence that acts to transfer the angular momentum and leads to gas supply to the accretion disks from the further outer regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , to appropriately study warped accretion disks , it is very practical to take into account both the finite sizes limited by the self - gravity and the plausible gas feeding at the outer boundaries ( see also the discussions of @xcite ) .",
    "the lifetime that the gas feeding lasts for , in principle , can be determined from the observed episodic lifetime of agns , for which there are several techniques , although the results are still primitive ( see @xcite for a review ) .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the alignment processes of black holes with their warped accretion disks by including the finite sizes of accretion disks and the continuous gas feeding controlled by the episodic lifetimes of agns . for the convenience of numerical implementation",
    ", we introduce a parameter `` the lifetime of gas fueling '' to describe the duration of gas supply .",
    "we employ an approximate global model following @xcite to describe the accretion process .",
    "this enables us to study the alignments of finite - size accretion disks in a quite simply way , avoiding being immersed in the time - consuming numerical simulations on the evolution of accretion disks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the properties of warped accretion disks and section 3 derives the basic evolution equations for the black hole - accretion disk system . in section 4 , we present the results for alignments / anti - alignments and spin evolution in a single accretion event and over a series of events .",
    "we then show the implications of our calculations for spin distribution and episodic lifetimes of agns in section 5 .",
    "discussions on plausible caveats of our calculations and conclusions are given in section  6 .",
    "in the weak - field limit , the frame - dragging effect due to a spinning black hole exerts a lense - thirring torque on each annulus of the accretion disk ( @xcite ) . by denoting the angular momentum of the annulus at a radius @xmath1 as @xmath2 and that of the black hole as @xmath3 , the lense - thirring torque reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gravitational constant and @xmath6 is the speed of light .",
    "this lense - thirring torque leads the annuli to precess around the rotating axis of the black hole at a rate of @xmath7 . since such differential precessing rate",
    "rapidly declines with radius as @xmath8 , the inner region of the accretion disk is intensely affected in the beginning and gradually warps propagate outwards over the entire disk .",
    "detailed theoretical analysis showed that the dynamics of warped accretion disks is characterized into two regimes depending on the importance of the pressure force and viscous force ( @xcite ) . if adopting the standard @xmath9-prescription of viscosity , warps propagate as bending waves for inviscid or sufficiently thick disks ( @xmath10 ) , whereas propagate in a diffusive fashion for strongly viscous disks ( @xmath11 ) . here",
    "@xmath12 is the semi - thickness of disks . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider thin and viscous accretion disks with _ keplerian _ rotation , in which @xmath11 is generally satisfied .",
    "this is the most likely case for accretion disks in agns with the eddington ratio at around 0.01 - 1 , the largest population in agn surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the presence of high viscosity ,",
    "the differential precess in the inner disk will be damped out rapidly , giving rising to an inner flat region ( so called bardeen - petterson effect ; @xcite ) .",
    "this region extends to the radius where the precessing timescale is comparable with the warp - diffusion timescale , the precessing time scale reads @xmath13 and the warp - diffusion time scale reads @xmath14 , leading to the warp radius as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vertical shear viscosity governing the warp diffusion through the accretion disks .    integrating over all the annuli yields the total torque exerted on the accretion disk @xmath17 as a reaction , the black hole , in the meantime , suffers an equal but opposite torque that cause its angular momentum to process as well . by taking into account the angular momentum carried by mass accretion",
    ", the angular momentum of the black hole evolves following @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass accretion rate onto the black hole and @xmath20 is the specific angular momentum at the marginal stable orbit @xmath21 .",
    "hereafter a hat symbol on top of a vector represents the corresponding direction vector .",
    "similarly , the angular momentum of disks changes with time as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is angular momentum summed over all the annuli and @xmath24 is angular momentum change due to gas fueling .",
    "note that @xmath25 is always orthogonal to @xmath3 , therefore , it can be expressed in a form of ( @xcite ) @xmath26 where the first term in the right hand side corresponds to the precession and the second term corresponds to change in the angle between the hole and the disk . we keep in mind that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are generally positive as shown in our previous numerical analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "considering that the inner region of the disk is aligned with the black hole and the lense - thirring torque drops off rapidly with radius , the major contribution to @xmath25 in equation ( [ eqn_torque ] ) comes from the integral around the warp radius @xmath29 .",
    "we therefore make an approximate for @xmath28 as @xmath30 below we will show that such an approximation of @xmath28 yields results that exactly agree with the previous analytical studies for small warps ( @xcite ) . note that @xmath27 only governs the precession of the black hole - disk system and therefore is not important for the present purpose .",
    "from above equations , we can now determine the evolution of the angular momenta @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the angle @xmath33 between the black hole and the accretion disk .",
    "we first define a lifetime of gas fueling @xmath34 as during which the accretion disk is continuously fed at a mass rate limited by the eddington rate @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the radiative efficiency for mass accretion ( see below section  [ sec_bhevo ] for definition ) .",
    "note again the inner region of the disk is aligned with the black hole .",
    "multiplying @xmath39 to equation  ( [ eqn_jh ] ) yields @xmath40 and multiplying @xmath41 to equation ( [ eqn_jd ] ) yields @xmath42 where we assume that the angular momentum of gas fueling is aligned with @xmath23 .",
    "the angle between the black hole and the accretion disk changes with time as @xmath43 we distinguish the evolution of @xmath33 into two phases as below .      during the phase with gas fueling",
    ", the accretion disk is continuously fed so that it maintains a preferred steady angular momentum distribution . as a result",
    ", one shall expect that the term due to gas fueling cancels out the other terms in equations ( [ eqn_jd ] ) and ( [ eqn_jds ] ) and @xmath23 and its magnitude @xmath32 remain somewhat constant , i.e. , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . with equations ( 3 ) and ( 7 )",
    ", we can simplify equation ( [ eqn_angle ] ) into @xmath46 since @xmath28 is positive , @xmath33 always tends to decrease towards zero regardless of its initial value , i.e. , alignment between the disk and the black hole ( see also @xcite ) .    in this phase , as the disk maintains its profile steadily , @xmath28 can be deemed to be a constant .",
    "there exists an analytic solution for equation ( [ eqn_angle_p1 ] ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the initial value of @xmath49 at @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    for small warps ,",
    "we extend the trigonometric functions in equation ( [ eqn_sol_p1 ] ) around @xmath52 and it is trivial to show that the corresponding solution decays exponentially as @xmath53 this is the analytic solution found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their equation ( 11 ) ) in their equation ( 11 ) . ] and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their equation ( 52 ) ) and the time scale of the exponential decay @xmath54 exactly agrees with their derivations .      after gas fueling is quenched , i.e. , @xmath55 , the total angular momentum of the system ( black hole and accretion disk ) becomes conserved .",
    "the disk subjects to both alignment and viscous diffusion .",
    "the former decreases the angular momentum of the disk ( @xmath56 in equation ( [ eqn_jds ] ) ) , whereas the later transfers the angular momentum outwards . substituting equations ( [ eqn_jhs ] ) and ( [ eqn_jds ] ) into equation ( [ eqn_angle ] ) and with some simple mathematical implementations , we arrive at @xmath57 following @xcite",
    ", we employ an approximate global model to simulate the influence of mass accretion on the disk properties so that accretion rate @xmath58 can be determined in a quite simple fashion . to this end , we define the effective radius of the disk @xmath59 as aims to simulate the disk evolution in a global way .",
    "it has the same order of magnitude as , but is not necessarily identical to , the disk s physical outer truncated radius . ]",
    "@xmath60 the mean global accretion rate is then given by @xmath61 where the accretion time scale reads @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the normal viscosity associated to the azimuthal shear due to the differential rotation of the disk . with the standard @xmath9-prescription ,",
    "@xmath63 is expressed by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the disk s aspect ratio and @xmath66 is the keplerian angular momentum . combining above equations ,",
    "we can obtain @xmath67 this equation apparently indicates the influences of alignment and accretion on @xmath19 . from equation ( [ eqn_jds ] ) ,",
    "alignment processes reduce the disk angular momentum @xmath32 at a rate of @xmath68 but leave the disk mass @xmath69 unchanged , therefore , increasing the accretion rate @xmath19 . on the contrary",
    ", mass accretion reduces the disk mass but approximately keeps the disk angular momentum unchanged , considering that angular momentum loss due to the accretion inflow through the marginal stable orbit is usually negligible , therefore decreasing @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , if only considering the influence of accretion rate , there exists an asymptotic solution to equation ( [ eqn_mdot1 ] ) ( see @xcite ) @xmath70^{-1/3},\\ ] ] and @xmath71^{-4/3 } , \\label{eqn_mdot_asym}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the accretion time scale at @xmath50 . for small warp cases",
    ", we expect that the mass accretion rate approaches the above asymptotic behaviors , i.e. , @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "with mass accretion rate , we now rewrite @xmath28 in a more convenient form .",
    "previous studies showed that the vertical viscosity @xmath16 is related to the normal azimuthal viscosity @xmath63 by ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a coefficient of order of unity .",
    "as a zeroth - order approximation , we neglect the detailed shape of warped accretion disks and make use of the estimate for surface density @xmath77 and for the angular momentum @xmath78 as in flat disks .",
    "this is reasonable since accretion disks reach maximally warped around the warp radius @xmath29 and then rapidly approach flat geometry beyond @xmath29 ( @xcite ) . combining equations",
    "( [ eqn_warp ] ) and ( [ eqn_k2 ] ) gives @xmath79 for small warp amplitude , @xmath80 , whereas for large warp amplitude , @xmath76 moderately decreases below unity , depending on the warp amplitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite developed a prescription to determine @xmath76 for any warp amplitude .",
    "however , this needs to know the detailed warp profile as a function of radius , therefore beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we simply set @xmath80 throughout our calculations and below we will show the reliability of our results in light of this simplification .",
    "the direction of the inner flat region of the disk depends on the inclinations of the incoming gas flow and the black hole : if @xmath81 , it aligns with the hole ; while if @xmath82 , it anti - aligns with the hole . by taking into account the mass loss carried away by radiation ,",
    "one obtains that the black hole grows as @xmath83 and by combining with equation ( [ eqn_jhs ] ) , the black hole spin evolves as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the radiative efficiency depending on the spin parameter @xmath86 via @xmath87 and the specific angular momentum is calculated as @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the gravitational radius , and the upper sign refers to prograde accretion while the lower sign refers to retrograde accretion ( @xcite ) .. in our calculations , the accretion may proceed from retrograde to prograde fashion over episodes .",
    "this effectively means than the black hole spin may suffer a flip from @xmath94 to @xmath91 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we neglect the counteracting torque and assume that black holes can carry any spin between -1 and 1 . ]",
    "according to the standard accretion disk model , the disk s aspect ratio @xmath65 is in an order of @xmath95 and weakly depends on radius in proportional to @xmath96 , on black hole mass in proportional to @xmath97 , and on mass accretion rate in proportional to @xmath98 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "an accretion disk becomes self - gravitating when its mass reaches a factor @xmath99 of the black hole mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the initial disk mass @xmath100 .",
    "the initial effective radius of the disk @xmath59 is determined by the required _ initial _ mass accretion rate and accretion time scale given with @xmath99 . to be specific , from equation ( [ eqn_mdot2 ] )",
    ", @xmath19 can be alternatively expressed through @xmath59 and @xmath99 by @xmath101 the corresponding accretion time scale is @xmath102 this is the typical timescale for accretion disks truncated by self - gravitational collapse ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio between the angular momenta of the disk and the hole is @xmath103 our calculating procedure is as follow .",
    "we start with a black hole that has a mass of @xmath104 and a spin of @xmath86 .",
    "the accretion disk is assigned an initial mass of @xmath105 and angular momentum of @xmath106 .",
    "the initial inclination angle between the black hole hole and the disk is  @xmath33 .",
    "we then evolve equations ( [ eqn_jds ] ) and ( [ eqn_mdot1 ] ) for the angular momentum and mass of the disk , equations ( [ eqn_mh ] ) and ( [ eqn_spin ] ) for the mass and spin of the black hole , and finally equations ( [ eqn_angle_p1 ] ) and ( [ eqn_angle_p2 ] ) for the inclination angle . the mass accretion rate @xmath19 is determined by equation ( [ eqn_mdot2 ] ) .",
    "we keep in mind that in the phase with gas fueling , the disk s mass and angular momentum are unchanged . for a series of accretion events , we just repeat the above procedure but with the mass and spin of the black hole inherit from the previous episode .",
    "we assume that in the beginning of an episode , the disk has already been formed and neglect the stage for the formation of the disk .",
    "it is expected that during the formation stage , the accretion rate must be very insignificant so that the influence on black hole spin evolution is negligible .",
    "also , we implicitly assumed that the time lag between the successive episodes is long enough to let the disk be consumed on the accretion time scale before the next episode starts .",
    "this can be verified by the fact that the observed `` duty cycle '' is generally much less than unity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "duty cycle measures the fraction of active black holes to total black holes , and equivalently indicates the time fraction of active phases over total lifetime ( active and inactive ) for a single black hole ( @xcite ) .    in following calculations , unless stated otherwise , we set @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 as the fiducial values .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the choice of @xmath59 dependent on black hole mass and the radiative efficiency aims to let the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath112 at about 0.25 , the typical value observed in luminous agn surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also set an upper limit of mass accretion rate by @xmath113 considering that beyond the eddington limit , radiative feedback may be important to regulate the accretion rate at around the eddington limit .      in figure [ fig_angle ] , we demonstrate evolution of the inclination angle between the disk and the black hole for different lifetimes of gas fueling : @xmath114yr .",
    "the initial value of @xmath33 is set to be @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the left and right panels , respectively . as can be seen , for the case of @xmath115 , the inclination angle rapidly decreases on a timescale of @xmath117yr , which is the typical estimate in previous numerous literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . as the lifetime of gas fueling @xmath34 increases , the decay rate of @xmath33 is slightly reduced .",
    "this is because during the gas fueling , the disk maintains its orientation and only the black hole is driven to align to the disk .",
    "while after the gas fueling is quenched , both the disk and the hole change their orientations towards the direction of the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "this can be further verified from equations  ( [ eqn_angle_p1 ] ) and ( [ eqn_angle_p2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of @xmath33 for @xmath118yr , namely , the disk is continuously fed throughout the time range of calculations , is exactly identical to the analytic solution found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the evolution of @xmath33 is much more complicated for the case of @xmath116 as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig_angle ] . with no gas fueling ( @xmath119 ) ,",
    "the inclination angle rises up to @xmath120 all the way .",
    "indeed , the instantaneous behavior of @xmath33 is governed by the ratio @xmath121 in equation  ( [ eqn_angle_p2 ] ) : for @xmath122 , the inclination @xmath33 decreases , while for @xmath123 , the inclination @xmath33 increases ( see also @xcite ) . as @xmath34 increases , the final configuration of the system transits from anti - alignment ( @xmath124 ) to co - alignment ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "we note there is a steep decreasing / increasing trend of @xmath33 just after the gas fueling is quenched , ascribed to the rapid reduce of the angular momentum of the disk and hence enhancement of mass accretion rate due to the viscous dissipation arising from alignments .",
    "see below for detailed explanations .",
    "figure [ fig_rate ] shows the corresponding mass accretion rates . for the sake of comparison , the asymptotic evolution of accretion rate by equation ( [ eqn_mdot_asym ] )",
    "is superposed in the left panel . if there is no gas fueling , as the inclination angle tends to zero , the angular momentum of the disk approach constant . as a result ,",
    "the mass accretion rate evolves asymptotically following equation ( [ eqn_mdot_asym ] ) . in the right panel ,",
    "the initial value of @xmath33 is @xmath116 . instead of a gradual decay",
    ", there exists a notable peak of accretion rate , which even reaches the eddington limit @xmath126 in some cases .",
    "the similar behavior of an enhancement of the mass accretion rate also appears in the previous numerical simulations on warped accretion disks ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this can be easily understood in terms of equations ( [ eqn_jds ] ) , ( [ eqn_rd ] ) , and ( [ eqn_mdot1 ] ) : strong dissipation arising from alignments leads to an intense reduce of the magnitude of @xmath32 ; the effective radius @xmath59 accordingly shrinks to maintain a keplerian rotating disk . as a consequence",
    ", the accretion time scale @xmath127 is shortened and mass accretion rate @xmath19 is significantly enhanced . in reality ,",
    "emergence of the enhancement of accretion rate depends on competition between the viscous - dissipation driven deduce of @xmath32 ( due to warp alignments ) and mass - accretion driven deduce of @xmath69 .",
    "this is the reason why there is no accretion rate enhancement for some curves in figure [ fig_rate ] .    by assuming the angular momentum conservation of the system",
    ", @xcite derived a condition for occurrence of anti - alignments : the initial angle between the disk and the hole satisfies @xmath128 .",
    "this equation is intensively used in subsequent studies on cosmological evolution of smbh spins ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we relax the assumption of the conservation of angular momentum and let the accretion disk steadily fueled for a lifetime of @xmath34 . since the total angular momentum of the system is not conserved , it is inappropriate to directly use the @xcite s condition . in the right panel of figure [ fig_angle ] ,",
    "the initial ratios @xmath129 and @xmath130 , therefore the condition @xmath128 is well established . however , for @xmath131yr , the system ends up an alignment instead of an anti - alignment .",
    "nevertheless , the ratio @xmath121 remains an important indicator of alignments or anti - alignments ( if there is no gas fueling ) .",
    "small ratios mean that the angular momentum of black holes dominates over that of disks , therefore it is comparatively easier to drive the disks towards alignments or anti - alignments .",
    "conversely , if the angular momentum of the disks is dominated , the holes are `` lighter '' to change their orientations .",
    "this is somehow similar to the cases that the disks are continuously fueled : the holes tend to align towards the disks ( see also the discussions of @xcite and @xcite ) .        in figures [ fig_mass ] and [ fig_spin ] ,",
    "we show evolution of the black hole s properties , i.e. , mass and spin , respectively , for initial inclination angles @xmath115 and @xmath116 with a set of gas fueling lifetimes @xmath34 . compared with the case of @xmath115",
    ", we can find that the black hole mass growth for @xmath116 is much more efficient .",
    "this is because the eddington limit is larger with lower radiative efficiency due to retrograde accretion for @xmath82 and also because the accretion rate is enhanced as plotted in figure [ fig_rate ] .",
    "the spin evolution in figure [ fig_spin ] clearly illustrates the important influences of gas fueling . as the lifetime of gas fueling increases",
    ", the black hole is gradually driven to align with the disk regardless of the initial inclination . as a result , in right panel of figure [ fig_spin ] ,",
    "there exists a trend for @xmath131yr that spin first declines due to retrograde accretion and then increases when the inclination angle transits to @xmath132 .",
    "in addition , it can be found that the spin changes are relatively more significant for black holes with @xmath133yr , because these holes undergo retrograde accretion throughout the episode , which carries larger angular momentum compared with the prograde accretion ( see equations ( [ eqn_lms1 ] ) and ( [ eqn_lms2 ] ) ) .",
    "the spin of black holes will reach an equilibrium value after a series of accretion events , depending on the fraction of prograde and retrograde accretion ( @xcite ) . evidently , this fraction is intimately relevant to the degrees of anisotropy in the orientations of accretion disks with respect to the holes .",
    "if all the accretion events occur with the initial inclination angles @xmath134 , the black holes accrete in a coherent fashion and their spin will be spun up all the way to the maximum ( @xmath91 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclination angles @xmath48 may distribute randomly over the whole space @xmath135 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for simplicity , we only focus on the random distribution of @xmath48 in proportional to @xmath136 over @xmath135 , so that both alignments and anti - alignments can occurs in our calculations .",
    "we first generate a random inclination angle and then apply the prescription described above to track down the mass growth and spin evolution of black holes .",
    "the calculation ends when the accretion rate decreases to one tenth of its initial value , i.e. , @xmath137 . in figure",
    "[ fig_spin_time ] , we illustrate how black hole spin evolves along their mass growth during a series of accretion events .",
    "we stress that we adopt the effective radius of accretion disks dependent on black hole mass as @xmath138 in order to guarantee the initial dimensionless accretion rate at @xmath139 in equation ( [ eqn_mdot_edd ] ) .",
    "once there is no gas fueling , irrespective of the initial spin values , black holes lose the memory of their initial status and approach a relatively low spin roughly after doubling their mass .",
    "then as mass growth , there is a weak trend that their spin gradually falls off .",
    "let s give an intuitive explanation for such weakly negative dependence of spin on mass through the ratio @xmath140 .",
    "since we adopt @xmath141 , equation ( [ eqn_ratio ] ) yields @xmath142 . of course , the real situation is much more complicated , but the negative dependence is retained ( see also below for further discussions ) .",
    "once the disks are fueled for a lifetime longer that the typical alignment timescale ( e.g. , @xmath118yr ) , as expected , the holes are always aligned to the disks and are rapidly spun up to fast rotating .",
    "however , we note that the final spin never reaches the maximal value @xmath91 because during the alignments , there exists a period with retrograde accretion that spins down the holes .",
    "this indicates that even though the final configuration in an accretion event is alignment instead of anti - alignment , the spin decrease during the time with retrograde accretion still contributes to the final spin status and therefore should be appropriately included .",

    "afterwards , this hole continues to accrete for a series of episodes .",
    "we randomly assign the number of episodes between @xmath158 so that in average the hole undergoes 500 times activities .",
    "we then record the final mass and spin information of the hole . in each accretion episode",
    ", the inclination @xmath48 between the hole and its accretion disk follows a uniform distribution of @xmath159 over @xmath160 .",
    "an individual event is regarded to be terminated once the accretion rate decreases below a tenth of its initial value .",
    "we repeat such procedure 500 times and are finally left with a sample of 500 black holes .    in figure [ fig_spin_dist ]",
    ", we plot the spin distribution with black hole mass for different gas fueling lifetime @xmath119 , @xmath117yr , @xmath161yr , and @xmath162yr in panels ( a)-(d ) , respectively . in panel ( a ) , there is no gas fueling and the disks will be consumed within an accretion timescale @xmath163yr ( see equation ( [ eqn_tacc ] ) ) .",
    "as the ratio @xmath121 decreases with black hole mass , the accretion disks of massive black holes are easier change their orientations and thus anti - alignments become more probable .",
    "this results in a negative correlation between spin and mass .",
    "a similar trend was also found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corresponding to @xmath164 in their model ) .",
    "when we switch on the gas fueling for a time of @xmath165yr in panel ( b ) , black holes are always driven to align towards the disks during this period .",
    "therefore , the fraction of retrograde accretion is significantly reduced and all the black holes carry spin @xmath166 .",
    "we also choose a mass - dependent lifetime of gas fueling for the sake of comparison with observations . in panel",
    "( c ) , the gas fueling lifetime is @xmath167yr , indicating that the disks surrounding @xmath168 black holes will be fueled for @xmath169yr , far longer than the alignment timescale .",
    "accordingly , smaller black holes are overall spun up to maximum rotating .",
    "there is a strong anti - correlation between spin and mass . on the other hand , in panel ( d ) , we reverse the mass dependence of fueling lifetime to @xmath170",
    ". as expected , massive black holes at @xmath171 have maximum spin @xmath172 whereas lower massive black holes in this case are not affected ( since @xmath173 is much less that the accretion timescale and can be neglected ) and just follow the distribution in panel ( a ) .",
    "we now compare our calculated spin distributions with observations .",
    "notwithstanding measuring spin of massive black holes is yet challenging so far , there are several developing techniques shedding useful light ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among these techniques , we focus on the direct measurements using the broad iron k@xmath9 line fitting ( @xcite and references therein ) and the indirect estimates using the radiative efficiency of thin accretion disks as a surrogate of the black hole spin ( see equation ( [ eqn_eta ] ) ; @xcite ) . both these two methods had been applied to a sample or a population of agns , allowing us to perform straightforward comparison .",
    "unfortunately , each method bears a large source of uncertainties that are not well understood and the obtained results seem incompatible at this stage .",
    "therefore , we perform comparison separately as follows .    in panel ( c ) of figure [ fig_spin_dist ] , we superpose the spin of 19 sources measured from iron k@xmath9 lines , most of which are seyfert i or narrow line seyfert i agns residing in spirals or lenticular galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that in this sample low massive black holes ( @xmath174 ) are spinning fast while black holes with mass @xmath175 may have moderate spin .",
    "our calculations show that a lifetime of gas fueling as @xmath167 can generally reproduce such observed spin distribution .",
    "this means low massive black holes require longer gas fueling to reach alignments and to accrete coherently .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite reconstructed the spectral energy distributions for a sample of 80 palomar - green quasars and estimated their individual radiative efficiency of accretion flows based on the thin disk model .",
    "they found a tight correlation between the efficiency with black hole mass approximately as @xmath176 ( but see also @xcite ) , plausibly implying a raise in the black hole spin with mass .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite applied the @xcite s argument ( @xcite ) to solve the continuity equation of smbh demography in active and quiescent galaxies ( @xcite ) and quantified the radiative efficiency with redshift and black hole mass .",
    "their results suggested that the efficiency undergoes cosmological evolution and generally there is an increasing trend of the efficiency with black hole mass at redshift @xmath177 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig_eta ] compares the radiative efficiency from our calculations by adopting the gas fueling lifetime @xmath170yr ( as in panel ( d ) of figure [ fig_spin_dist ] ) with these from observational constraints of @xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", the radiative efficiency is calculated from black hole spin as equation ( [ eqn_eta ] ) by assuming that the thin disk model applies .",
    "as stated above , in the context of chaotic accretion without gas fueling , high massive black holes ( @xmath171 ) have low spin because of net spin - down by retrograde accretion with anti - alignments .",
    "therefore , to maintain the observed high radiative efficiency ( and high spin ) , sufficient prolonged gas fueling is in need for these holes .",
    "longer gas fueling means that there is plenty of gas reservoir progressively channeled into the accretion disks and the black holes are accordingly long - lived .",
    "there are several techniques developed for measuring or estimating episodic lifetimes of agns , see @xcite for a review . in table",
    "[ tab_lifetime ] , we summarize the observational constraints on episodic lifetimes of agns through the proximity effect and the fluorescent ly@xmath9 emission . note that both these constraints are presently only realizable for high - redshift , luminous quasars , indicating that there reside high massive black holes ( plausibly @xmath178 ) .",
    "it seems that the observed agn episodic lifetimes are generally @xmath179yr but with large uncertainties .",
    "such long lifetimes strongly imply that high massive black holes are rapidly spinning at high redshift , consistent with previous studies probed through the radiative efficiency ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our calculations in the present work further show that if the correlation between the efficiency and the black hole mass is reliable , low massive black hole must accrete in more chaotic way and a gas fueling lifetime as @xmath180 can roughly reproduce the observed slope @xmath176 .",
    "this gives rise to an episodic lifetime of @xmath181 yr for smbhs with @xmath182 , coincident with the observations .",
    "the main differences of the present work compared with the previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) lie at : 1 ) we include the influences of continuous gas fueling on the alignments between black holes and their accretion disks ; and 2 ) we consider the finite - size accretion disks ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are several simplifications in our calculations meriting further explanations .",
    "first , we neglect the detailed structures and properties of accretion disks and employ an approximate global model to simulate the evolution of disks under alignments and accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are thus unable to handle the angular momentum transportation throughout the disks",
    ". this may be important when the disks suffer large warps ( @xmath183 ) in which non - linear effects cause the disk structures around the warp radius to change dramatically and the simple global approximate plausibly becomes invalid .",
    "however , since the spin parameter invokes the whole accretion history , we expect that our results are insensitive to this effect . secondly , the main free parameters in our calculations are the disk s aspect ratio @xmath99 and the effective radius @xmath59 . in terms of the mass accretion rate , @xmath99 and @xmath59",
    "is degenerated along lines of constant @xmath184 . as mentioned above",
    ", the standard accretion disk model shows that @xmath99 is almost insensitive to radius and only weakly depends on black hole mass and mass accretion rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath99 to the intermediate value between @xmath95 .",
    "the effective radius is chosen by a specified mass accretion rate in equation ( [ eqn_mdot_edd ] ) , which is roughly at @xmath185 from agn surveys .",
    "we recalculate the spin distribution for @xmath99 between @xmath186 and @xmath187 and find the results are qualitatively unchanged .",
    "thirdly , the lense - thirring torque @xmath28 calculated by equation ( [ eqn_k2_mdot ] ) is also a well approximate for small warps ( @xcite ) .",
    "when disks are strongly warped , on one hand , the relation @xmath188 no longer applies , in particular in the region around the warp radius ; on the other hand , the vertical shear viscosity @xmath189 deviates from the relation in equation ( [ eqn_vis ] ) and turns to be decreasing as warp amplitude increases ( @xcite ) . to see how our results depend on @xmath76",
    ", we artificially set an extreme value of @xmath190 for large inclination angle @xmath191 and show the comparison with @xmath80 in figure  [ fig_fnu ] .",
    "the choice of a such range is based on the study by @xcite who found that the non - linear term becomes important for angular momentum transportation when the inclination angle @xmath192 .",
    "black hole spin magnitude is systematically smaller because of the reduced torque @xmath28 for large warps .",
    "however , we can find that the changes are moderate with such an extreme @xmath76 value and the overall spin distribution with mass is preserved .",
    "for simplicity , we also assume that disk fueling is chaotic so that the initial inclination angle @xmath48 between the disks and black holes distributes randomly over @xmath135 .",
    "@xcite proposed a comprehensive modeling on the anisotropy of @xmath48 using a parameter @xmath193 to describe the fraction of accretion events with @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , @xmath195 stands for fully chaotic fueling and @xmath164 stands for fully coherent accretion .",
    "@xcite further extended this prescription and connected the anisotropy parameter @xmath193 with the dynamic properties of the host galaxies .",
    "they postulated that the ratio of the rotation velocity to the velocity dispersion of the galaxies mirrors the degree of anisotropy of the gas component channeled into the nuclear regions .",
    "they argued that the rotation velocity measures the bulk rotation of the galaxies while the velocity dispersion measures how chaotic the galaxies are .",
    "this seems in line with the recent finding of @xcite that the virial factor in reverberation mapping , which encodes the geometric and kinetic properties of the broad - line regions of agns , is related with the large - scale morphology of the host galaxy bulges .",
    "however , numerical simulations showed that the angular momentum of gas inflowing into the nuclear regions ( @xmath196pc ) will lose its memory of the initial direction on the the larger scales ( @xmath196 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is well supported by the observations that agns are misaligned with the host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these conflicts reflect our poor understanding on the detailed processes in black hole fueling from the galaxy scale to the central disk scale .",
    "we await future observations to justify these conflicts and we content with our present assumption .",
    "we consider only thin accretion disks with the disks aspect ratio @xmath197 to guarantee that the viscosity is strong enough to validate the bardeen - petterson effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our approach only applies to the accretion disks with dimensionless accretion rate @xmath112 at @xmath198 , which are believed to correspond to the thin disk regime . beyond this range , accretion disks transit to be thick and",
    "the bardeen - petterson effect may be weak or even disappear , as confirmed by recent magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the heuristic mhd simulations by @xcite revealed a new `` magneto - spin alignment '' mechanism that works in thick disks with strong magnetic .",
    "unlike the bardeen - petterson effect , this mechanism arises from the magnetic torque of the black hole s magnetosphere , which is already aligned with the black hole spin axis due to the frame - dragging forces .",
    "it is unknown yet how the spin evolves for thick warped disks and more investigations are highly worthwhile .    in conclusion , we study the alignments of black holes and their accretion disks by taking into account the finite sizes of disks and the continuous gas fueling .",
    "our results show that , with fiducial values for the free parameters , the lifetime of gas fueling is crucial to the alignments / anti - alignments and therefore to the spin evolution . by applying our prescription to a series of accretion activities and assuming that the disk orientations are chaotically distributed over episodes , we compared our calculated spin distribution with the spin measurements through iron k@xmath9 line fitting and through the radiative efficiency and made attempt to place constraints on the lifetime of gas fueling .",
    "unfortunately , the spin measurements through these two techniques at this stage seems incompatible to allow us draw a firm conclusion .",
    "we find that generally a lifetime of gas fueling as @xmath167yr can reproduce the spin distribution reported by the iron k@xmath9 line fitting , whereas a lifetime as @xmath170yr can reproduce these constraint through the radiative efficiency .",
    "however , the later case seems consistent with the observed episodic lifetime as long as @xmath199yr for very luminous agns at high redshift , which plausibly harbor @xmath178 smbhs .",
    "since the lifetimes of gas fueling are linked to the episodic lifetimes of agns , we proposed that the episodic lifetimes should be regarded as a new ingredient for the semi - analytic models of smbh growth and spin evolution .",
