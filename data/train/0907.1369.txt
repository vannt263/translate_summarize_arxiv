    "graph partitioning is a problem of fundamental importance both in practice and theory .",
    "many problems belonging to the several areas of computer science namely clustering , pram emulation , vlsi layout , packet routing in networks can be modeled as partitioning a graph into two or more parts ensuring that the number of edges in the cut is `` small '' .",
    "the word `` small '' does nt refer to finding the min - cut in the graph as it does nt ensure that the number of vertices in both sides of the cut is large . to enforce",
    "this balance condition one needs to normalize the cut - size in some sense . for the known notions of normalization like _ conductance _ , _ expansion _ and _ sparsity _ , finding optimal separators is np - hard for general graphs .",
    "hence , the objective is to look for efficient approximation algorithms .",
    "because of the huge amount of work done to design good approximation algorithm for these problems , graph partitioning has become one of the central objects of study in the theory of geometric embeddings and random walks . the first approximation algorithm for graph conductance came out of the study of the reimannian manifolds in form of the well known cheegar s inequality @xcite which says that if @xmath8 is the conductance of the graph and @xmath9 is the second largest eigenvalue of graph laplacian then @xmath10 .",
    "because of the quadratic factor in the lower bound , the true approximation is @xmath11 which in worst case can be @xmath12 in worst case . the first true approximation algorithm for sparsest cut and graph conductance",
    "was designed by leighton and rao @xcite whose approximation factor was @xmath13 .",
    "this also gave an @xmath13 * _ pseudo - approximation algorithm _",
    "* for @xmath0-balanced separator .",
    "this algorithm is referred to as a pseudo - approximation algorithm because instead of returning a @xmath0-balanced cut , it returns a @xmath14-balanced cut for some fixed @xmath15 whose expansion is at most @xmath13 times the optimum expansion of best @xmath0-balanced cut .",
    "their algorithm was based on an lp framework motivated from the idea of multi - commodity flows .",
    "their main contribution was to derive an approximate max - flow min - cut theorem corresponding to multi - commodity flow problem and the sparsest cut .",
    "subsequently , a number of results were discovered which showed that good approximation algorithms exist when one is considering extreme cases such as the number of edges in the graphs is either very small or very large .",
    "in fact , it is known for planar graphs one can find balanced cuts which are twice as optimal @xcite and for graph with an average degree of @xmath16 , one can design @xmath17-factor approximation algorithms where @xmath3 with running time polynomial in input size @xcite ( such an algorithm is called a _",
    "polynomial time approximation scheme _ or ptas ) .",
    "after 16 years the approximation factor of @xmath13 was improved to @xmath5 in a breakthrough paper by arora , rao and vazirani .",
    "their algorithm is based on semi - definite relaxations of these problems .",
    "the techniques and geometric structure theorems proved in their paper has subsequently led to breakthroughs in the field of metric embeddings .",
    "the basic philosophy behind these approximation algorithms is to embed the vertices of the input graph in an abstract space and derive a nice cut in this space . in the linear programming approach",
    "one uses this abstract space as the @xmath18 metric @xcite . in the semi - definite programming framework used in @xcite one",
    "embeds the vertices on the surface of an @xmath19-dimensional unit sphere such that they form an @xmath20 metric .",
    "the @xmath20 metric on the unit sphere translates into saying that for any three vectors the angle subtended by any two among these at the third one is acute .",
    "one of the major tools used in this paper is the phenomenon of measure concentration on unit spheres .",
    "* hardness results : * graph partitioning problems like sparsest cut and balanced separator are considered to among the few np - hard problems which have resisted various attempts to prove inapproximability results . after the result of arv",
    ", there has been a lot of impetus towards proving lower bounds on approximation factors .",
    "it has been shown by ambuhl et al @xcite that sparsest cut ca nt have a ptas unless np - complete problems can be solved in randomized sub - exponential time .",
    "because of the strong connections between semi - definite programming and the unique games conjecture ( ugc ) of khot @xcite , certain inapproximability results are also known which assume ugc . more specifically , khot and vishnoi @xcite show that ugc implies super - constant lower bounds on the approximation factor . in the following year , devanur et al @xcite showed that the integrality gap of the sdp relaxation of arora - rao - vazirani is @xmath21 thereby disproving the original conjecture of arv that the integrality gap of their sdp relaxation is atmost a constant .",
    "this result did not rely upon the ugc .",
    "the recent progress towards designing efficient and good solutions to unique games has also been motivated from designing a reduction from unique games to sparsest cut @xcite .      in order to define _ * concave programming * _ one first needs to define a concave function .",
    "a concave function is the reverse of a convex function .",
    "formally , a function @xmath22 with domain * * dom**@xmath23 is said to be concave if * * dom**@xmath23 is convex and for all @xmath24 * * dom**@xmath23 , @xmath25 for all @xmath26 $ ] . therefore , @xmath23 is concave iff @xmath27 is a convex function .",
    "based on this definition one defines concave programming as a form of mathematical programming in which one optimizes a concave function over a convex feasible set .",
    "more formally , a concave programming problem can be written as @xmath28 $ ] where @xmath29 is a convex set in @xmath30 and @xmath23 is a concave function .",
    "+ concave programming covers a broad range of non - linear global optimization problems which includes the well - known dc(_difference of convex functions _ ) programming . due to its well - structured nature and wide applicability in economic problems as well as various other practical problems like allocation - location , water storage , standardization etc .",
    "@xcite , there has been a lot of work in the field of optimization towards designing algorithms for various concave programming problems .",
    "one of the key properties of concave programming being exploited in these algorithms is a result that says that _ for every concave programming problem there is an extreme point of the convex feasible set @xmath29 which globally minimizes the optimization problem_. the first algorithm for concave programming was designed by tuy @xcite in a restricted scenario when the feasible set is a polytope . a more general case , when the feasible set is convex but not necessarily polyhedral , was solved by horst @xcite and subsequently by hoffman @xcite , tuy and thai @xcite .",
    "general concave programming is np - hard as @xmath31-integer programming can be cast as a concave program .",
    "there has been work towards designing efficient algorithms for some special class of concave programming .",
    "it has also been shown that some concave programs problems pertaining to production - transportation problems can infact be solved in strongly polynomial time @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive list of works done in concave programming can be found in vaserstein s homepage @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , we introduce the use of a new family of concave programs towards designing an improved approximation algorithm for the @xmath0-balanced separator problem .      in section 2 ,",
    "we formally introduce the notions of sparsity and balanced cuts and sketch the semi - definite relaxation for @xmath0-balanced separator of arv .",
    "we then start section 3 by introducing a family of relaxations for @xmath0-balanced separator which is generated by a parameter @xmath32 . in section 4 , using the techniques from @xcite , we show that one can improve the approximation factor to @xmath33 if the proposed family of programs can be solved ( by solving we mean getting a @xmath17-approximate answer ) in polynomial time . our result ,",
    "although conditional , proposes new directions of progress on this problem and also a family of optimization problems which are more powerful than semi - definite programs in the context of approximation algorithms . then in section 5 show that one can transform this family of programs into a concave program , a form of mathematical programming in which one seeks to minimize a concave function over a convex feasible set .",
    "there are a number of algorithms which can solve such programs with arbitrary accuracy @xcite , although one is not guaranteed to achieve a polynomial time convergence using these algorithms .",
    "since this family is a new form of mathematical programming that is being used in an approximation algorithm , progress both in the direction of hardness and algorithms will provide more insights into the nature of these concave programs and can potentially lead us to optimal inapproximability results for various graph - partitioning problems .",
    "we end the paper with section 6 in which we present conclusions and open problems .",
    "we now define the two versions of balanced graph partitioning problem namely the sparsest cut and @xmath0-balanced separator .",
    "it is well known that upto constant factors approximating other versions of graph partitioning like like graph conductance and uniform sparsest cut are equivalent to approximating the sparsest cut .",
    "although in this paper , we will mainly be concerned with the @xmath0-balanced separator problem .",
    "* sparsest cut * + given a graph @xmath34 with @xmath35 , for each cut @xmath36 define _ sparsity _ of the cut to be the quantity @xmath37 .",

    "unifying the spectral and the metric based ( linear programming ) approaches , arv used the following sdp relaxation to get an improved ( pseudo)-approximation algorithm for the @xmath0-balanced separator .",
    "let us call this program @xmath42 ,    @xmath43 + @xmath44 + @xmath45 + @xmath46    it is easy to see that this indeed is a _ vector program _ ( and hence an sdp ) and is a relaxation for the @xmath0-balanced separator problem . to show that this is a relaxation we have to show that for every cut we can get an assignment of vectors such that all the constraints are satisfied and the value of the objective function is the size of the cut . given a cut @xmath47 if one maps all the vertices in @xmath48 to a unit vector @xmath49 and the vertices in @xmath50 to @xmath51 then the value of the function is indeed the cardinality of @xmath52 . the main idea behind their algorithm is to show that for any set of vectors which satisfy the constraints of the sdp there always exist two disjoint subsets of `` large '' size such that for any two points belonging to different subsets the squared euclidean distance between them is atleast @xmath53 .",
    "the same idea is also used to get an improved approximation algorithm for sparsest cut in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this key idea has crucially been used in various other sdp based approximation algorithms and in solving problems related to metric embeddings .",
    "consider the following family of optimization problems which depend on a parameter @xmath54 .",
    "this family is essentially an extension of the semi - definite program proposed by arv . throughout the paper",
    "we will use @xmath55 to represent the @xmath56 norm .",
    "let us call this family of programs @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 + @xmath44 + @xmath59 + @xmath60    note that for @xmath61 this is the sdp relaxation proposed by arv .",
    "for @xmath62 , we are mapping the points onto a unit sphere , therefore we do not have to force the additional triangle inequality constraint of @xmath56 metric .",
    "the same mapping described for @xmath42 of the vertices of the graph onto the unit sphere allows us to conclude that each program in this family is also a relaxation for @xmath0-balanced separator .",
    "we will show that the techniques used in @xcite for lower bounding the optimum value of their semi - definite program can be extended in this case as well by appropriately modifying the ingredients of theorem 1 of their paper . under the assumption that we can solve @xmath57 in polynomial time for any @xmath63 , @xmath64 , we are able achieve an approximation factor of @xmath65 .",
    "we first show how to modify the results of @xcite , thereby reducing the problem of obtaining an improved approximation algorithm to that of finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the family of programs mentioned above .",
    "we first modify the definition of @xmath66-separated sets    two sets of vectors in @xmath30 , @xmath48 and @xmath67 are said to be @xmath66-separated if for all @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 .    for @xmath32",

    "since this family provably gives better approximation guarantees than the celebrated linear and semi - definite relaxations of leighton - rao @xcite and arora - rao - vazirani @xcite respectively , investigation both in the direction of polynomial time solvability or hardness will be highly interesting .",
    "the formulation of the proposed family of programs into a well - structured form of mathematical programming called concave programming also gives us hope that for many of the problems for which optimal approximation factors are not known one can possibly rely upon some `` nice '' programs which are although not convex but can be potential candidates for polynomial time solvability .",
    "given that some algorithms for solving concave programs are easy simple to comprehend , it would be also interesting to know whether one can analyze their runs on @xmath128 and prove polynomial time convergence . another area of investigation",

    "<S> the @xmath0-balanced separator problem is a graph - partitioning problem in which given a graph @xmath1 , one aims to find a cut of minimum size such that both the sides of the cut have at least @xmath2 vertices . in this paper , we present new directions of progress in the @xmath0-balanced separator problem . more specifically , we propose a new family of mathematical programs , which depends upon a parameter @xmath3 , and extend the seminal work of arora - rao - vazirani ( arv ) @xcite to show that the polynomial time solvability of the proposed family of programs implies an improvement in the approximation factor to @xmath4 from the best - known factor of @xmath5 due to arv . </S>",
