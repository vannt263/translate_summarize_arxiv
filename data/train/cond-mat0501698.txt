    "quantum frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets have attracted a great deal of interest in connection with the search for exotic phases , such as spin liquids .",
    "anderson proposed a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state as a prototype of spin liquids three decades ago  @xcite .",
    "since then , a number of works have studied the conjecture that both geometrical frustration and strong quantum fluctuation may destroy magnetic long - range order and stabilize a quantum disordered liquid - like ground state without symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "for example , it is believed quite likely that quantum spin systems on kagome lattices and pyrochlore lattices can exhibit quantum spin liquid states , though the elucidation of their ground states remains an important unsolved problem . in related works ,",
    "the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) introduced by rokhsar and kivelson has been extensively studied as an effective low - energy theory of quantum disordered states with short - range antiferromagnetic correlation and a spin excitation gap  @xcite .",
    "the important feature of the qdm is that its hilbert space is spanned by only dimer covering states composed of singlet pairs of nearest - neighbor spins , and this is the key to its success in describing quantum disordered states  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in the pioneer paper by rokhsar and kivelson that a short - range rvb state is realized in the qdm as its exact ground state .",
    "it was also argued by several authors that the qdm may be an effective low - energy theory of quantum antiferromagnets on the kagome lattice .",
    "however , it is not unclear how to derive the qdm directly from the original quantum spin hamiltonian by truncating the hilbert space .",
    "indeed , it appears difficult to find a general answer to this question .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we do not seek such a general result .",
    "instead , to obtain better insight regarding the mechanism stabilizing quantum spin liquids , we attempt to make progress toward determining what kinds of quantum spin systems possess a low - energy sector described by the qdm .",
    "the main result of this paper is the rigorous proof that a certain class of quantum antiferromagnetic spin systems in two dimensions with multiple ring exchange interactions is equivalent to the qdm .",
    "these systems exhibit a short - range rvb state or a valence bond crystal ( vbc ) state , depending on the values of their parameters .",
    "our results clarify the important role played by the ring exchange interactions in the realization of quantum spin liquid states  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we present results of an @xmath0 heisenberg spin system with multiple ring exchange interactions defined on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "it is shown that for a particular parameter the rigorous ground state is the short range rvb . in this rvb state ,",
    "spin - spin correlations decay exponentially , and therefore there is no magnetic long range order . on the other hand , correlations between spin - singlet dimers exhibit power law long - distance behavior , implying the existence of low - lying spin - singlet gapless excitations . in sec.iii and sec.iv",

    "although the states except ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fig.3 are not the ground state of @xmath27 , the kinetic term for the states @xmath40 and @xmath41 are expressed by the linear combination of these states . to see this ,",

    "in particular , we are concerned with the action of @xmath47 and @xmath48 on the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 the first pair of relations here implies that @xmath47 and @xmath48 act as the potential terms of @xmath42 . in the following ,",

    ", we need to verify their actions on unflippable dimers that are not flipped by @xmath57 , as shown in fig.1(b ) .",
    "it is easily shown that the actions of @xmath59 and @xmath60 on the unflippable dimers generate dimer covering states that are not in the ground - state space of @xmath27 .",
    "these non - ground states contain at least one singlet pair in the set of six spins surrounding the hexagon to which an operation is applied ; i.e. the spins on @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 in fig.1(a ) when the operators are applied to the @xmath9-th hexagon .",
    "thus , the unwanted states are excluded by the projection onto the maximum spin states of these six spins .",
    "this is carried out by applying the operator @xmath61 . also , using the relation @xmath62",
    ", we find @xmath63 , @xmath64 , thereby arriving at the hamiltonian ( [ hr ] ) .      we now show that the hamiltonian @xmath2 has the same ground state properties as the qdm in a certain parameter region .",
    "the lowest energy sector in the hilbert space of @xmath65 is spanned by vb states , provided that the ground state of @xmath29 can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath66 . to find the ground state , it is useful to rewrite @xmath29 into the form @xmath67    for @xmath68 , the energy eigenvalues of @xmath29 are non - negative , and only unflippable dimer states are zero energy states .",
    "therefore the ground state of @xmath65 is a dimer covering without flippable dimers .",
    "if we simply impose periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath69 and @xmath70 directions , the ground state remains macroscopically degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is removed by imposing periodic boundary conditions with a shift by one hexagon in the @xmath70 direction .",
    "then , the unique ground state is the staggered vbc ( see fig.1(d ) ) , which was previously identified by moessner et al .",
    "@xcite    the energy levels of @xmath29 are non - negative also in the case of @xmath71 .",
    "although the staggered vbc is obviously a zero energy state here too , in this case there also exists a non - trivial , liquid - like ground state .",
    "it is easily seen that the equal - amplitude superposition of dimer states @xmath72 is the zero energy state of @xmath29 if the summation @xmath73 is restricted within a sector of dimer states related by the local operations ( [ tt ] ) and ( [ kk ] ) .",
    "generally , a class of dimer states connected by these local operations is characterized by a topological number  @xcite . on a honeycomb lattice , however , in addition to a topological number , the total number of dimers in each direction is also conserved by the local flip .",
    "thus , @xmath74 is the unique ground state of @xmath65 in a given sector specified by these conserved quantities .",
    "this state , preserving both the spin - rotational and spatial symmetries , is a spin liquid state , and it is in the same universality class as the short - range rvb state .",
    "in fact , the upper limit of the spin - spin correlation function for this state exhibits long distance exponential decay expressed by  @xcite latexmath:[\\ ] ] with @xmath100 . here",
    "the summation @xmath101 is taken over the nearest neighbor sites of the @xmath9-th square ( the eight sites on @xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath21,@xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath102,@xmath103 in fig.3(a ) ) .",
    "the operator @xmath104 is the 4-body ring exchange interaction on the @xmath9-th square .",
    "the ground state space of the @xmath0 klein model on a square lattice is more complicated than that of the model on a honeycomb lattice . in the case of a square lattice ,",
    "in addition to dimer covering states , some states with spin - singlet pairs on next - nearest neighbor sites are also in the ground state space .",
    "an example of such states is depicted in fig.3(b ) .",
    "however , fortunately , such singlet states are not in the ground state space of @xmath29 , and they can be excluded from our consideration .",
    "it is thus found that at the rk point @xmath71 , under periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath69 and @xmath70 directions , the ground state of @xmath105 is the short - range rvb state @xmath106 , where @xmath66 is the dimer covering state on the square lattice .",
    "the low energy properties of this short - range rvb state were investigated in detail by rokhsar and kivelson  @xcite . for @xmath68 , the staggered vbc state depicted in fig.3(c )",
    "is the unique ground state .",
    "in this case , we divide the triangular lattice into three honeycomb lattices , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , as shown in fig.4(a ) . here",
    ", each site consists of two sites of two different honeycomb lattices .",
    "the hamiltonian on this lattice is also given by @xmath2 .",
    "the klein hamiltonian @xmath27 for this system has the same form as that given in eq.([hk ] ) , but , here it is defined on a triangular lattice , and it is expressed in terms of the @xmath1 spin operators .",
    "the ground state space of this klein model is spanned by states fully packed with loops composed of singlet dimers on the three kinds of hexagons arranged sequentially in order the @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , ... we show an example of loop covering states in fig.4 .",

    "( see fig.4(b ) . )",
    "the ground state properties are similar to the models considered in the previous sections . at the rk point ,",
    "the equal - amplitude superposition of loop covering states is the unique ground state in a given sector .",
    "the loop statistics of this state are described by a classical loop model referred to as the `` red - green - blue model '' .",
    "the loop correlation functions of this state exhibit power - law long - distance behavior  @xcite .",
    "therefore the excitation energy in the spin singlet - singlet channel of this system is gapless .",
    "this ground state represents a new universality class of a spin liquid described by the quantum loop model .",

    "the @xmath9-th hexagon is denoted by thick lines.,width=188 ]",
    "in this paper , we have presented rigorous results for two - dimensional quantum spin systems with multiple ring exchange interactions that possess quantum spin liquid ground states .",
    "it should be noted that misguich et al . and liming et al",
    ". showed that for the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice , sufficiently strong ring exchange interactions destroy magnetic long - range order , and stabilize a spin liquid state  @xcite .",
    "the spin liquid state found by them has a remarkable similarity with the ground state discussed in the present paper : exponentially decaying spin - spin correlations , and a large number of spin singlet excitations in the spin gap ( at least for some parameter regions ) . since the classical heisenberg model with ring exchange interactions does not possess macroscopic degeneracy , we speculate that the underlying structure of the model may have a close connection with the klein model , which is the origin of singlet gapless excitations in our models .",
    "these observations imply that the realization of the spin liquid state due to ring exchange interactions may be generic in quantum antiferromagnets , though the models considered in the present paper is rather complicated .",
    "the multiple ring exchange interaction is a result of strong quantum fluctuations , which destabilize conventional magnetic orders . in real systems ,",
    "effects of such strong quantum fluctuations have been extensively studied so far in connection with magnetism of solid @xmath120he@xcite .",
    "also , it has been discussed that multiple ring exchange interactions may affect significantly the magnetic structures of nis@xmath121 .",
    "thus , there is a possibility that the quantum spin liquid state due to ring exchange interactions may be realized in real systems with sufficiently strong multiple ring exchange interactions .",
