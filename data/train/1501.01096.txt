    "the positron in a crystal lattice is strongly subjected to repulsion from the positive atom core .",
    "because of the locally reduced atomic density inside the open volume defects , positrons have a high probability to be trapped and to annihilate with electrons in these defects by the emission of two 511 kev photons .",
    "the doppler broadening of the 511 kev annihilation line is mainly caused by the momentum of the electron due to the very low momentum of the thermalized positron .",
    "the doppler broadening parameter @xmath13 , obtained from the 511 kev annihilation line , reflects the fraction of positrons , annihilating with electrons of low momentum ( valance electrons ) . in this study ,",

    "[ sic_neutron_dft](a ) .    in order to investigate the magnetic coupling ( ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism ) between these v@xmath17v@xmath18-induced local moments , we put two 4h - sic 4@xmath14@xmath11 supercells side by side along the _ a_- or along the _ c_- direction .",
    "each 4@xmath14@xmath11 supercell contains one v@xmath17v@xmath18 .",

    "the possible impurities , such as boron and nitrogen ( see ref . ) , with the concentration of the order of 10@xmath40 @xmath41 can also modify the charge state of v@xmath17v@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we calculate the interaction for different charge states .",
    "as shown in table i , v@xmath17v@xmath18 does not couple with each other along the _ c _ axis , even when _",
    "d@xmath39 _ is as small as 10.11  .",
    "the exchange interaction is much stronger along the _ a _ axis and strongly depends on the charge state .",

    "d@xmath39 _ is 12.33  .",
    "the result is also consistent with the previous report @xcite , in which the coupling between neutral v@xmath17v@xmath18 is also antiferromagnetic .",
    "negatively charged v@xmath17v@xmath18 divacancies favor a ferromagnetic coupling .",

    "d@xmath39 _ is increased from 12.33 to 18.50  .",
    "the mutual dependence of spin - polarization and exchange interaction on the concentration of defects is not only suggested for sic , but also for graphene / graphite @xcite as well as for nitrides @xcite and oxides @xcite . to develop the long - range ferromagnetic coupling ,",
    "it is also crucial to keep the stacking order in graphite @xcite .    in figure [ sic_neutron_dft](b )",
    ", we plot the ferromagnetic exchange interaction energy depending on _ d@xmath39_. as shown in fig .",
    "[ sic_neutron_dft](a ) and ( b ) , the ferromagnetism induced by divacancies requires that divacancies are negatively charged with _",
    "d@xmath39 _ in the range from 12.33   to 15.42  .",
    "the required _ d@xmath39 _ would correspond to a concentration of divacancies of the order of 36@xmath110@xmath42 @xmath41 ( 1/_d@xmath43 _ ) .",
    "this concentration is around 1 at.% of sic and well above the maximum concentration for the local moments we obtained by neutron irradiation ( see fig .",
    "[ figmvsfluence_nsic ] ) .",
    "however , after irradiation with the largest neutron fluence the density of paramagnetic centers ( _ n _ ) starts to saturate probably due to the appearance of local regions which contains a large density of defects and tends to be non - spinpolarized as shown in fig .",
    "[ sic_neutron_dft](a ) .",
    "moreover , it is also crucial to keep the crystalline ordering for long - range ferromagnetic coupling @xcite . in this sense , it is unrealistic to expect ferromagnetic coupling throughout the whole bulk sample . in principle , it is in agreement with our experimental observation .",
    "the experimentally observed weak ferromagnetism probably can be understood as a local effect : only some particular regions with nm or @xmath9 m dimension can accommodate a high concentration of divacancies .",
    "these regions form ferromagnetic bubbles with very strong interaction ( see table i ) , leading to the high curie temperature .",
    "presumably , these regions could be at the surface , an interface or a grain boundary .",
    "however , according to our calculation the spin - polarization will be unfavorable if _ d@xmath39 _ is too small .",
    "therefore , the narrow fluence window of ferromagnetism shown in fig . [ figmvsfluence_nsic ] as well as in neon implanted sic @xcite can be speculated : in the beginning of neutron irradiation , the defect concentration increases , and some local regions accommodating a larger concentration of divacancies appear to be ferromagnetic .",
    "d@xmath39 _ in the local regions reaches the critical value of about 10  , the increase of the defect concentration will suppress the spin polarization .",
    "there may appear some new local regions with the concentration of divacancies reaching to the level to induce ferromagnetism , but the damage to the crystalline structure by irradiation will weaken the coupling .",
    "also , the existence of minor and major carriers in sic can lead anti - ferromagnetic coupling and cancel the ferromagnetic coupling to some degree .",
    "therefore , the magnetic moments can not be increased by increasing the fluence of irradiation all the time , while , the amount of paramagnetic centers can be scaled up with neutron fluence and show saturation at very large fluences .",
    "the locally accumulation of ferromagnetic defects has also been suggested for defective ferromagnetic oxides @xcite .    to clarify",
    "if the defect induced ferromagnetism is associated with some local regions , it rather calls for a sophisticated investigation using methods which are sensitive to the magnetic order and provide an enough spatial resolution at the same time .",
    "spin polarized scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite or muon spin relaxation @xcite could provide us a further insight , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "to investigate defect - induced magnetism in sic , we applied a broad neutron fluence covering four orders of magnitude to generate defects in a controlled way .",
    "a huge paramagnetic contribution is observed and scaled up with neutron fluence , whereas ferromagnetism only appears in a certain , rather low fluence range or after annealing treatments .",
    "first - principles calculations hint towards a mutually exclusive role of defects : a low defect concentration favors spin - polarization , but leads to negligible magnetic interaction . combining both experimental and first - principles calculation results , we conclude that defect - induced ferromagnetism can not be scaled up with the volume . it should be rather understood as local effect .",
    "therefore , our investigation answers why the measured magnetization is low for defect - induced ferromagnetism in sic .    financial support from the helmholtz - gemeinschaft deutscher forschungszentren ( vh - ng-713 , vh - vi-442 and pd-146 ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
