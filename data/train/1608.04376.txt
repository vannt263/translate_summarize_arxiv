    "if the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is to be complete , then there must be a mechanism through which elementary particles acquire mass .",
    "the higgs mechanism achieves this purpose , and a particle with the required properties was recently observed by the atlas and cms collaborations at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "we can test some of the predictions of the sm by studying the higgs boson s couplings to other particles .",
    "the sm does not numerically predict these couplings directly ; it postulates relatively simple expressions for their size in terms of other observables . therefore , if we can measure these observables ( particle masses , mixing angles , etc . ) while characterizing the strength of the higgs couplings via its production and decay rates , we can determine whether or not the relations predicted by the sm are correct .",
    "this gives us a clue as to whether or not the sm higgs mechanism actually provides masses for all constituents of the sm .    for heavy gauge bosons @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "we expect the higgs couplings to be equal to @xmath8 in the sm , where @xmath9 is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "the measured couplings have been found to be consistent with the sm within experimental error  @xcite . in the fermion sector",
    ", we expect the higgs couplings to quarks @xmath5 to be equal to @xmath10 in the sm .",
    "this is also true for charged leptons .",
    "the quantities @xmath10 are usually called the yukawa couplings @xmath11 .",
    "since the couplings are proportional to the quark masses , we expect higgs - mediated processes to be dominated by the heavy ( top and bottom ) quark contributions .",
    "indeed , higgs production is controlled mainly by gluon fusion whereby two gluons initiate a heavy quark loop which ejects a higgs boson .",
    "there are several experimental analyses which probe the higgs couplings to the heavy ( top and bottom ) quarks  @xcite .",
    "these are also found to be consistent within uncertainties with the sm prediction , so we conclude that the sm higgs mechanism is a valid theory for the origin of the heavy gauge bosons and quarks masses .",
    "the situation is less clear for lighter quarks . constraining the light quark yukawa couplings",
    "is important since there are alternate models in which they differ from the sm expectation  @xcite or do not enter at all  @xcite .",
    "constraints can be placed on the charm and strange quark yukawa couplings using inclusive higgs production rates in various sm decay channels  @xcite and through exclusive radiative mesonic decays , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a charmonium or @xmath14 meson  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "the charm yukawa coupling is expected to be measured at a future international linear @xmath15 collider to high precision using the anticipated excellent charm tagging in the low - background @xmath15 collision environment  @xcite .    up and down quark yukawa couplings are by far the hardest to constrain : at the lhc it is basically impossible to distinguish higgs decays to up and down quark jets from @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , since the cross section for quark fusion , @xmath18 , is proportional to the square of the relevant quark yukawa coupling @xmath19 , for sm couplings proton collisions are much more likely to result in @xmath20 than @xmath21 and @xmath22 even though @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the valence quarks of the proton . in particular , the up and down quark masses are @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 masses evaluated at @xmath28 ) while @xmath29 ( @xmath27 mass evaluated at @xmath30 )  @xcite .    it is customary to parametrize the deviations of the yukawa couplings from their sm values using scaling factors @xmath31  @xcite , so that the coupling terms in the lagrangian become @xmath32 , with @xmath33 corresponding to the sm . we will adopt the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the light quark couplings are all scaled relative to the bottom quark coupling .",
    "this greatly reduces the theoretical uncertainty in the reference coupling since the bottom quark mass has a much smaller experimental uncertainty than the up and down quark masses",
    ". it also facilitates comparisons with the literature .",
    "since the yukawa couplings are proportional to the relevant quark mass , we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the light quark coupling scaled relative to that of the bottom quark . in the sm we expect @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the current tightest constraints on up and down quark yukawa couplings come from higgs production and decay rates .",
    "a global fit to all on - resonance higgs data , allowing all of the higgs couplings to vary , yields @xmath38 and @xmath39 at 95% confidence level  @xcite . fixing all higgs couplings to their sm values except for one of the up or down quark yukawa couplings at a time instead",
    "yields @xmath40 , @xmath41 , again at 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "an alternative method  @xcite considers the inclusive @xmath42 production rate in the off - shell region , which is unaffected by the total higgs width ; current data yields limits less sensitive by about a factor of two than the on - shell fits .",
    "two completely different methods for constraining the up and down yukawa couplings have recently been proposed .",
    "the first relies on measuring isotope shifts in atomic clock transitions , which can be affected by higgs exchange as well as the usual electroweak gauge boson exchange  @xcite .",
    "this method depends strongly on the precision of future isotope shift measurements and on an accurate theoretical determination of the electroweak gauge contribution ; nevertheless , it may yield constraints at a level comparable to the higgs coupling fit described above .",
    "the second relies on a future discovery of higgs - portal dark matter ; in such a scenario , if the dark matter relic density is set by the usual thermal freeze - out , current direct - detection limits already constrain the light quark yukawa couplings at the level of @xmath43  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a complementary technique to constrain the higgs couplings to up and down quarks using the higgs boson production kinematics at the lhc .",
    "if the shapes of the higgs kinematic distributions from gluon - fusion production are sufficiently different from the shapes of the same distributions initiated by quark fusion , a measurement of these distributions can be used to discriminate between them and set limits on the fraction of higgs events produced via quark fusion .",
    "there are good theoretical reasons to expect the kinematic distributions for higgs production via @xmath44 or @xmath45 fusion to be different from those via gluon fusion .",
    "the higgs transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution is shaped mainly by the additional jet radiation from the initial - state partons , which is controlled by the strong charges and spins of the initial - state partons .",
    "indeed , we find that the gluon - fusion process has a harder @xmath0 distribution than quark fusion , allowing these to be discriminated . for concreteness , we parametrize the higgs @xmath0 distributions in terms of a high-@xmath0/low-@xmath0 asymmetry parameter and determine the optimum division between the high- and low-@xmath0 regions",
    ".    we would also expect the higgs longitudinal momentum ( @xmath46 ) to be smaller ( more central ) in the gluon - fusion process and larger in the quark - fusion processes , due to the asymmetry in the average proton momentum fraction carried by a valence quark and the corresponding antiquark .",
    "however , after taking into account the detector acceptance for the higgs decay products in the four - lepton channel , we find that the @xmath46 distributions do not provide additional sensitivity . this distribution may be worthy of further study in the diphoton decay channel .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : hadron_collisions ] we derive the condition on the gluon and up- and down - quark couplings which ensures that the total rate in the 4 lepton channel is the same as in the sm .",
    "this makes our method statistically independent from the fit to signal strengths .",
    "we then compute the cross sections , branching ratios and detection efficiencies that we will need for all the relevant processes using madgraph5_amc@nlo",
    "section  [ sec : cfkd ] defines the asymmetry observable of our method and provides sample momentum distributions from simulations .",
    "we determine the expected statistical uncertainty on the up and down quark yukawa couplings with 300 and 3000  fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity at the 13  tev lhc .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions1 ] gives some context for the strength of our constraints and summarizes our conclusions .",
    "appendix  [ sec : appendix_stats ] contains a derivation of the statistical error on our asymmetry observable .",
    "we consider @xmath42 , with @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "the background for the four - lepton final state is produced mainly by direct @xmath49 production via quark and gluon fusion  @xcite .",
    "the reason for using the @xmath50 final state is that this background is very small compared to the background in the diphoton channel , so that we can ignore it here .",
    "we also ignore higgs production via vector boson fusion , associated production with a @xmath6 or @xmath7 boson , and associated production with a @xmath51 pair ; these processes can be separated out using other kinematic features . the observed rate for the signal process",
    "can then be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total higgs production cross section ( including only our production modes of interest ) , @xmath54 is the branching ratio of the higgs to the four - lepton final state , and @xmath55 is the detector acceptance for this final state .",
    "our first task is to determine the relationship between @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and the @xmath58 effective coupling @xmath59 ( defined normalized to its sm value ) that must be satisfied for the @xmath42 rate to be equal to its sm expectation .",
    "we will assume that all other higgs couplings besides these three are fixed to their sm values .",
    "in addition to computing the cross sections , including interference between the processes involving @xmath59 and @xmath60 that arises at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd , we must determine the detector acceptances for the four leptons for each of these processes .",
    "let us first consider the cross section @xmath53 . at leading order ( lo ) ,",
    "the only two diagrams contributing to higgs production are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo_feynman ] .",
    "the higgs boson is a color singlet , so it does not couple to gluons at tree level .",
    "however , one can introduce an effective vertex ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo_feynman ] as a black dot ) which takes into account the fact that @xmath61 is mediated by a heavy quark loop ; this is how gluon fusion higgs production will be handled in our monte carlo simulations .",
    "the two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo_feynman ] have different particles in the initial state , so they do not interfere with each other at lo .",
    "we can then separate the gluon fusion and up- and down - quark fusion cross sections according to @xmath62 where we define @xmath63 as the sm ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) gluon fusion higgs production cross section computed at lo , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 as the appropriate quark fusion cross sections computed at lo with @xmath67 . note that @xmath68 and @xmath66 are normalized in such a way that they are roughly six orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding sm cross sections .        at nlo",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "in addition to the virtual corrections , real radiation diagrams contribute , some of which give rise to interference as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo_feynman ] .",
    "we therefore have @xmath69 where we separate the gluon fusion , quark fusion , and interference pieces of the nlo cross section based upon their dependence on the coupling scaling factors @xmath59 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . the reference cross sections @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are defined with @xmath73 .        in order to simulate higgs events ,",
    "we use madgraph5_amc@nlo 2.2.3  @xcite .",
    "madgraph automatically generates matrix elements for a process in terms of initial , final ( and possibly intermediate ) particles specified by the user .",
    "the default sm implementation in madgraph explicitly sets the yukawa couplings of the higgs to up and down quarks equal to zero .",
    "furthermore , one can not easily generate @xmath61 since this coupling does not exist at tree level in the sm . in order to generate events which contain all the required higgs interactions",
    ", we instead use the nlo higgs characterization model  @xcite , which includes an effective vertex for the higgs to gluon coupling as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo_feynman ] .",
    "we introduce a further scaling factor @xmath59 to modify this vertex .",
    "we also modify the model by implementing higgs couplings to up and down quarks , which we set equal to the higgs coupling to bottom quarks with additional scaling factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we use a higgs mass of 125  gev throughout .",

    "the greater sensitivity in the @xmath93 case can be explained by the greater difference between @xmath94 and @xmath95 compared to the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath96 ( see table  [ table : optimal_cuts_and_a ] ) .",

    "we note that with 3000  fb@xmath1 , the statistical uncertainty on the asymmetry in the @xmath50 channel is 7% ; this sets the scale for whether systematic uncertainties will have a significant effect on our results .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented a method for constraining the up and down quark yukawa couplings at a level comparable to competing approaches using higgs @xmath0 distributions in the four - lepton final state .",
    "our method is orthogonal to the constraint from a global fit to higgs signal strengths in various production and decay channels , and hence can be combined to further increase the precision .",
    "we find that 3000  fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity at the 13  tev lhc can constrain @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the constraints are weaker for negative @xmath56 and @xmath57 due to interference effects . including the two - photon final state may improve the sensitivity .",
    "while we were finalizing the manuscript , we became aware of two recent papers  @xcite that also use higgs @xmath0 distributions to constrain the higgs couplings to quarks .",
    "@xcite considers constraints on the bottom , charm , and strange yukawa couplings , while ref .",

    "@xcite fits the higgs @xmath0 distribution to published lhc results combining the four - lepton and two - photon final states , and extrapolates the expected sensitivity to 300  fb@xmath1 at 13  tev , and find constraints on @xmath60 roughly comparable to ours at this luminosity .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "we thank andrea peterson for help with madgraph and for providing a modified version of the nlo higgs characterization model file with higgs couplings to up and down quarks .",
    "each event that we see has a definite @xmath0 of the higgs boson , but depending on whether or not a given value is less than @xmath106 it either contributes @xmath107 or @xmath108 to the quantity @xmath109 .",
