    "the dynamics of two - level systems in an external field has been thoroughly studied for years .",
    "this problem appears in several physical systems and is significant for the realization of quantum gates  @xcite .",
    "the model consists of the hamiltonian of a two - level system , coupled to a classical field or to a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "there are no general methods for solving analytically these models without any approximations , so several approaches have been used to study their behavior .",
    "the best known is the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , that consists in neglecting the effects of the rapidly rotating terms  @xcite .    for an atom residing in a resonant cavity",
    "the frequency @xmath1 of the rabi oscillations between the two relevant states of the atom is typically @xmath2 of the atomic frequency @xmath3 and of the cavity frequency @xmath4 , so that the rwa yields a good description of the system  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed )  @xcite , where superconducting qubits play the role of artificial atoms , one can enter the so - called ultrastrong coupling regime in which the ratio @xmath5 @xcite ( at resonance , @xmath6 ) . in this regime ,",
    "effects beyond rwa should be taken into account , both for the dynamics of pure states  @xcite and for dissipative dynamics  @xcite .",

    "the consideration of high rabi frequencies is natural in quantum information theory , since high speed operations are needed to perform a large number of quantum gates within the decoherence time scale , an unavoidable request for fault tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a deeper understanding of the effects beyond rwa is relevant for the prospects of quantum computation .    in this paper",
    ", we explain , in a non - perturbative manner , the non - trivial bloch vector s path of a two - level system exposed to a monochromatic field . by considering the infinitesimal evolution of the state vector",
    ", we determine the temporal dependence of the rotation axis and frequency .",
    "in particular , we show analytically that , when the field is treated as a classical object , the rotation frequency oscillates between zero and twice the value predicted by the rwa .",
    "the vanishing of the rotation frequency is associated with cusps in the bloch vector s path .",
