    "it is well known that the gravitational lensing by the foreground objects ( e.g. , galaxies ) can alter the apparent brightness of background objects ( e.g. , quasars ) , which may contaminate our observations .",
    "three decades ago , barnothy and barnothy ( 1968 ) proposed that all the quasars were nothing but the gravitationally magnified images of seyfert galactic nuclei .",
    "press and gunn ( 1973 ) showed that the probability of occurrence of gravitational lensing in an @xmath5 universe is nearly unity .",
    "for many years there had been a lack of both convincing observational and theoretical supports for these speculations .",
    "however , numerous and unprecedented deep galaxy surveys have recently revealed a considerably large population of faint galaxies ( metcalfe et al .",
    "1996 ; references therein ) .",
    "this motivates one to readdress the question if the observations of background objects are seriously affacted by the gravitational lensing effect of foreground galaxies ? for this purpose ,",
    "zhu & wu ( 1997 ) have calculated the lensing cross - sections of background quasars by the foreground galaxies , and concluded that , despite the fact that there is a considerably high surface number density of faint galaxies the total lensing cross - sections by galaxies towards a distant source are still rather small , when only a special cosmological model of @xmath6 is considered .",
    "nevertheless , the optical depth ( probability ) of gravitational lensing depends sensitively on the cosmological models .",
    "it is worthy of examining whether the above claim is valid under general cosmological models . in this paper , we extend our previous work to a variety of cosmological models , which are characterized by the mass density parameter @xmath0 and the normalized cosmological constant @xmath1 ( cf . ,",
    "carroll , press & turner 1992 ) .",
    "this is well motivated because cosmological models with nonzero cosmological constant have become quite popular recently .",
    "many years ago , gott , park & lee ( 1989 ) have given the general expressions for the optical depth and mean image seperation in general friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological models .",
    "yet , these expressions are complicated and thereby hard to use in practice .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is thus to simplify the formula .",
    "furthermore , we would like to investigate how the cosmological parameters affect the estimate of the lensing cross - section .",
    "we assume a homogeneous and isotropic universe described by a robertson - walker metric ( weinberg 1972 ) : @xmath7.\\ ] ] or in the form @xmath8.\\ ] ] where @xmath9    the relation of the measurables to the unmeasurables is ( lightman et al .",

    "@xmath21 at @xmath18 , @xmath20 reads ( gott , park & lee 1989 ) @xmath22",
    "first of all , we consider the lensing cross - section ( turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ) due to a specific galaxy . following turner et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , we model the mass density profile of the total galaxy matter as the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , whose magnification for a point source is given by ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ; wu 1996 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the observed angular position of the source ( image position ) , @xmath25 is the angular radius of einstein ring and @xmath26 is the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy . note that we only include the contribution of the primary image because here we will not deal with the statistics of multiple images .",

    "[ ratio ] has been employed .",
    "now , let s consider the contributions of an ensemble of galaxies having different luminosities and redshifts .",
    "the present - day galaxy luminosity function can be described by the schechter function ( peebles 1993 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates the morphological type of galaxies : @xmath31=(e , s0 , s ) .",
    "the above expression can be converted into the velocity dispersion distribution through the empirical formula between the luminosity and the central dispersion of local galaxies @xmath32 .",
    "we keep the same parameters ( @xmath33 ) as those adopted by kochanek ( 1996 ) based on the surveys ( loveday et al .",
    "1992 , marzke et al .",
    "1994 ) , which yield @xmath34 km / s and @xmath35 for @xmath36 galaxies , and the morphological composition @xmath37 for ( @xmath38 ) . for the spatial distribution of galaxies ,",
    "we employ a general flrw cosmological model parametrized by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which has been outlined in section 2 . finally , the total dimensionless magnification cross - section by galaxies at redshifts ranging from 0 to @xmath27 for the distant sources like quasars at @xmath27 is @xmath39 the parameter @xmath40 represents the effectiveness of the @xmath31-th morphological type of galaxies in producing double images ( turner et al .",

    "[ total - cross ] is very useful . dividing the expression by @xmath55 ,",

    "[ probability ] , one obtains the conventional optical depth for multiple images .    in the above calculations , we have assumed that the comoving number density of galaxies is constant .",
    "however , this may not hold true for the realistic situation .",
    "the influence of galaxy evolution on the the lensing cross - section should also be taken into account .",
    "zhu and wu ( 1997 ) have include this effect by using the galaxy merging model proposed by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , since the scenario of galaxy merging can account for both the redshift distribution and the number counts of galaxies at optical and near - infrared wavelengths ( broadhurst et al .",
    "there are two effects arising from the galaxy merging :",
    "the first is that there are more galaxies and hence more lenses in the past .",
    "the second is that galaxies are typically less massive in the past and hence less efficient as lenses . as a result of two effects ,",
    "the total magnification cross - section remains roughly unchanged ( zhu & wu 1997 ) .",
    "knowing the analytic expressions for the lensing cross - sections in general flrw cosmologies , we can explore in detail the influences of cosmological parameters by numerical computation .",
    "we compute the probability @xmath59 so as to investigate whether the background objects ( like quasars ) counts are significantly contaminated .",
    "[ probability ] contains three factors , namely , the @xmath56-dependent term , the galaxies term and the cosmological term , associated with @xmath59 . here",
    "we concentrate on the cosmological term by adopting the maximum value @xmath60 ( kochanek 1996)and a moderate magnification of @xmath61 .        fig .  1",
    "shows how the probability @xmath62 depends on the normalized cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 for an open ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) and a flat ( @xmath65 ) universe respectively . in our calculations , the source has been set at @xmath66 or @xmath67 respectively , and a moderate magnification of @xmath68 has been used .",
    "indeed , the probability @xmath59 depends sensitively on cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , even for a @xmath4-dominated ( @xmath69 ) flat universe , only a small fraction ( @xmath70 ) of the sky can be moderately ( @xmath3 ) lensed by galaxies .",
    "of course , by taking somewhat lower value for @xmath56 the probability of the magnification can siginificantly increase . in order to get a more robust conclusion",
    ", we now estimate what value of magnification would affect the current observations of quasar count , i.e. , we calculate the value of @xmath71 which makes @xmath72 . the resulting magnification , which depends on both the cosmological model and the source redshift , is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "since the magnification is generally much lower than @xmath73 , our result reinforces the hypothesis that the quasar counts are not seriously contaminated by the galactic lenses .",
