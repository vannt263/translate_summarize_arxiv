    "massive stars are ubiquitous in many star - forming regions , and their feedback processes have significant impacts on the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "uv / fuv radiation photoionizes / photodissociates molecular gas , and the h  ii and photodissociation regions ( pdr ) expand around the massive star .",
    "the stellar winds and supernovae explosions give rise to expanding bubbles in ism .",
    "the role of these feedback processes in relation to ism has been studied from two competing perspectives on their effects on star - formation activity .",
    "the expanding h  ii region and bubble erode the parental molecular clouds and suppress star formation ( _ negative feedback _ ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the shock front ( sf ) emerges as the high - pressure region expands .",
    "the sf compresses the ism and star formation can be triggered in very dense layers ( _ positive feedback _ ) .    in this paper , we focus on the h  ii regions and their feedback processes .",
    "the role of the expanding h  ii regions is also discussed in terms of negative and positive feedback processes .",
    "most of the massive stars are born in the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and h  ii regions begin to expand in the dense cores and clumps in gmcs ( ultra compact h  ii regions , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as the h  ii region expands , the molecular gas is gradually eroded . when the if reaches the cloud surface , the ionized gas spouts from the cloud ( `` champagne flow '' , see tenorio - tagle 1979 ) .",
    "the molecular material around massive stars is dispersed , so that star formation is quenched ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",
    ", the sf emerges in front of the if owing to the pressure excess of the h  ii region .",
    "the sf sweeps up the ism to form a shell and star formation will be induced by the instability of the shell .",
    "the sf also compresses pre - existing globules through their photoevaporation and star formation will be triggered ( radiative implosion ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "these efforts have successfully shown the various dynamical aspects of the expansion in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous ambient media .",
    "however , these do not include the outer pdr and thermal processes that should be dominant there .",
    "@xcite have analytically shown that the dissociation fronts ( dfs ) initially expand outside the sf , but finally slow down to be taken into the shell . @xcite and @xcite studied the expansion of the h  ii region and outer pdr around a single massive star , solving the radiative transfer of uv and fuv photons .",
    "although the hydrodynamics has not been included , they have shown that a significant amount of the molecular gas is not ionized but photodissociated . @xcite",
    "have pointed out that the photodissociation of the molecular gas reduces the star - forming capacity of the cloud    @xcite have provided a good simple example to investigate the role of the expanding h  ii region .",
    "they have observed the molecular fragments around the galactic h  ii region , sharpless 104 ( sh104 ) , and found a young cluster within the core of one fragment .",
    "they have argued that this is clear evidence of the `` collect and collapse '' model . in our previous paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter , paper i ) , we have modeled sh104 performing the hydrodynamical calculation including the pdr and the swept - up shell as well as the h  ii region .",
    "our calculation has shown that the molecular shell forms around the h  ii region shielding the fuv radiation .",
    "the abundance of the accumulated molecules shows excellent agreement with the observation .",
    "we have also suggested a role for the expanding h  ii regions as a positive feedback process .",
    "the swept - up mass remains in the shell and the shell can be dominated by the cold molecular gas shielding uv and fuv photons .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported dozens of galactic h  ii regions similar to sh104 , which show that such triggering is a common process in some situations .",
    "so , the next interesting questions to answer are the following :    * how does the time evolution change with differing ambient number density and mass of the central star ?",
    "is the molecular gas always accumulated in the shell ?",
    "if the evolution change with a different ambient density or central star , why so ?    to answer these questions , we investigate the time evolution of the h  ii region , pdr , and the swept - up shell with various ambient number densities and central stars . as in paper",
    "i , the uv- and fuv - radiative transfer and the thermal and chemical processes are solved using a time - dependent hydrodynamics code .",
    "we show the numerical results of some representative models and explain what causes the differences among models .",
    "we can show that , in many cases , the fuv photons are shielded and the molecular gas is finally gathered in the shell .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we explain the input physics of our code .",
    "the subsequent  3 is devoted to showing the procedures of the numerical calculation .",
    " 4 and 5 are the main part of this paper , where the numerical results are shown .",
    "the dependence on the ambient number density , and on the luminosity ( mass ) of the central star is studied in each section .  6 and 7 are assigned to discussions and conclusions .",

    "the thermal conduction is needed to satisfy the `` field condition '' ( see appendix [ sec : field ] ) .",
    "we do not include the self - gravity of the gas to study the simple situation of the hii region expanding into a homogeneous medium . even if we include the gas self - gravity , the h  ii region quickly expands at the velocity of @xmath24 , and the smaller inward velocity caused by the self - gravity does not significantly affect our results .",

    "equation ( [ eq : msh_nsc ] ) shows that the swept - up mass is larger with the lower density medium .",

    "the upper panels of fig.[fig : fev_5000 ] and [ fig : fev_50 ] show the time evolution of various front positions . initially , the dfs expand more rapidly than the sf and the if , then the pdr appears in front of the sf .",
    "as the h  ii region expands , the if and the sf gradually overtake the preceding dfs of h@xmath58 and co in turn . finally the dfs are taken up into the shell .",
    "the sf enters the molecular region , and the molecular gas is accumulated within the shell .",
    "the rapid reformation within the shell also helps to accelerate the accumulation of the molecular gas .",

    "fig.[fig : dscale_schem ] is a schematic picture showing the density - dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the incident fuv flux is attenuated enough by the dust extinction through the shell , and the molecular gas is reliably protected in the outer part of the shell . though the density - dependence of @xmath42 , @xmath61 , is weaker than that of @xmath43 , @xmath62 , the dust absorption becomes significant with a high number density owing to the attenuation law of @xmath63 .",

    "the column density of the shell at @xmath64 is already @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) in this model . in model",
    "ld - s41 , on the other hand , the incident fuv flux is weak , but the column density of the shell is low . since the co molecules are mainly shielded by the dust absorption , it is not until @xmath42 becomes somewhat large ( @xmath67 ) that co molecules are accumulated in the shell .",
    "however , even in the early phase when @xmath68 , h@xmath58 molecules can be quickly accumulated in the shell , as fig.[fig : fev_50 ] shows .",
    "this is due to the efficient self - shielding of h@xmath58 molecules .",
    "@xcite have briefly shown that h@xmath58 molecules can be self - shielded , if @xmath69 at the if . in our calculations , @xmath70 in model ld - s41 and @xmath71 in model hd - s41 at @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , h@xmath58 molecules are mainly self - shielded in model ld - s41 , and shielded by the dust in model hd - s41 respectively . the self - shielding effect for co molecules",

    ", the temperature has a negative gradient and the density has a positive gradient , which is similar to model s41 ( paper i ) .",

    "the gas temperature decreases from 500  k to 25  k through the shell in model hd - s41 and from 50  k to 25  k in model ld - s41 .",

    "the fuv flux is attenuated from @xmath78 to 0.1 through the shell in hd - s41 , and from @xmath76 to 1.5 in ld - s41 at the time of fig.[fig : over_5000 ] and [ fig : over_50 ] . in model hd - s41",
    ", the gas temperature significantly decreases toward the outer part of the shell , because the photoelectric heating becomes inefficient .",
    "conversely , the gas density of the outer region of the shell rises to @xmath79 .",
    "the collisional heat transfer between the gas and dust is efficient there , and the gas temperature is almost equal to the dust temperature .",
    "the the swept - up shell is geometrically thicker in model hd - s41 .",
    "figs.[fig : over_5000 ] and [ fig : over_50 ] also show that the density jump at the if is larger with the lower ambient density .",
    "this can be explained by the analytic jump condition at the weak d - type if , @xmath80 @xcite , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the sound speed ahead and behind the if , and @xmath83 is the quantity less than unity . since the temperature @xmath84 is lower for the lower ambient density , the density at the inner edge of the shell is higher in model ld - s41 .",
    "it is important to know whether or not the swept - up molecular layer fragments , as the triggered star formation scenario predicts .",
    "we do not consider the dynamical instability , but only the gravitational instability for the fragmentation of the shell , as discussed in paper i. in the lower panels of figs.[fig : fev_5000 ] and [ fig : fev_50 ] , the shaded region is the expected unstable region , where @xmath85 . the swept - up shell in each model is expected to suffer from gravitational instability .",

    ", the density is relatively low in the inner part of the shell .",
    "the unstable region appears at @xmath86  myr ( @xmath87 ) and gradually extends from the cold molecular layer , as fig.[fig : fev_5000 ] shows . as explained in the previous subsection , both h@xmath58 and co molecules are shielded by the dust , and the shell is dominated by these molecules when the shell becomes unstable . in model ld - s41 ,",
    "the swept - up shell is relatively cold and dense ( see fig.[fig : over_50 ] ) .",
    "the unstable region rapidly spreads in the whole shell at @xmath88  myr ( @xmath89 ) . in this model ,",
    "the shell is dominated by h@xmath58 molecules due to the efficient self - shielding effect by the time of the shell - fragmentation . however , the column density of the shell is still not high enough to protect co molecules by the dust extinction in the early expansion phase .",
    "the accumulation of co molecules begins after the shell becomes unstable , which is different from model hd - s41 .",
    "regardless of some differences , the expanding h  ii region can sweep up the molecular gas , and the fragmentation of the shell is finally expected with different number densities .",
    "the star formation will be triggered in the fragmented shell along the lines of a `` collect and collapse '' scenario .",
    "in this section , we investigate how the time evolution of the h  ii region , pdr , and the shell depends on the uv / fuv luminosity ( mass ) of the central star . for this purpose , we calculate the expansion around the central star of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 as representative cases .",

    "@xcite have noted that the photoelectric heating can be as important as the photoionization heating , even in the h  ii region .",
    "the importance of the dust absorption in the h  ii region is often evaluated with the column density of the dust - free static h  ii region , @xmath132 @xcite , where @xmath133 is the dust - free strmgren radius , @xmath9 is the ambient number density , and @xmath95 is the uv photon number luminosity of the central star . the radius of the corresponding dusty h  ii region is smaller for larger @xmath134 .",
    "@xcite has also shown that the dust absorption in the h  ii region gradually becomes inefficient , as the h  ii region dynamically expands .    in order to evaluate the effect of the dust in the h  ii region ,",
    "we have calculated some models including the dust in the h  ii region as well as the outer pdr . in models s41-hd and s41-ld , the radius of the h  ii region and pdr decreases only by 10% and 3% compared with the dust - free counterparts . in models s101 and s41 , the reduction of each region is 20% and 5% of the dust - free radius .",
    "these results agree with equation ( [ eq : nhii ] ) , which shows that the dust absorption in the h  ii region becomes significant with the higher ambient number density , or the more massive central star . in all of the above calculations , however , the dust absorption in the h  ii region is not so significant .",
    "furthermore , the dust in the h  ii region also absorbs fuv photons in addition to uv photons .",
    "as briefly mentioned in paper i , this only slightly promotes the accumulation of molecules in the shell . therefore",
    ", dust grains in the h  ii region hardly affect our conclusions .",
    "the dust absorption in the h  ii region is more important in the denser and more compact region ( e.g. , ultra compact h  ii region ) , where the detailed treatment of grains is required .",
    "the reformation of h@xmath58 molecules on the grain surface is one of the key processes in our calculations .",
    "the fuv radiation is consumed in photodissociating the reformed molecules in the shell , which accelerates the accumulation of h@xmath58 molecules .",
    "however , there still remain uncertainties in the reformation rate , which depends on the detailed behavior of h atoms and h@xmath58 molecules on the grain surface . at high dust temperatures , for example ,",
    "h atoms absorbed on the grain surface evaporate before the reformation of h@xmath58 molecules .",
    "the critical temperature , @xmath135 , is about 20  k on pure grains , but @xcite have shown that the irregular surface with impurity sites raises @xmath135 to @xmath136 .",
    "recently , @xcite have refined the absorption process of h atoms on the grain surface , and obtained a much higher critical temperature of @xmath137  k. in our calculations presented in  4 and 5 , we have not included the high - temperature cut - off in the reformation rate , for simplicity .",
    "we analyze the validity of this treatment here .",
    "we calculate some models including the cut - off using the functional form given by @xcite ( hm79 ) . in each model ,",
    "two cases of @xmath138  k ( hm79 ) and 35  k are applied . with @xmath138  k ,",
    "however , the h@xmath58 molecular abundance in the shell is hardly affected in all examined models . with @xmath139",
    "k , the accumulation of h@xmath58 molecules in the shell is slightly delayed , but the shell is finally dominated by h@xmath58 molecules . the h@xmath58 abundance in the shell is reduced only by 2% in model s41 ( paper i ) and 5% in model s41-hd at @xmath47 . in the region where h@xmath58 molecules accumulate , the fuv radiation is well shielded and the dust temperature is low .",
    "therefore , even if the reformation is inefficient above several ten k , our conclusions do not change .",
    "our calculations do not include detailed energy and ionization balance of the small grains such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "the ionization rate and size distribution of small grains are important factors for the pdr structure .",
    "the photoelectric heating rate depends on the abundance and ionization rate of pahs , and the dust attenuation law of fuv photons may be slightly affected by the change of the grain size distribution .",
    "we have calculated some models with different photoelectric heating rates given by @xcite based on the different abundance of small grains .",
    "the temperature profile in the pdr would be modified by a factor of less than 2 , but this does not affect our conclusions .",
    "some recent observations detect the strong pah emission around the h  ii region .",
    "this emission sometimes shows the clear ring - like structure , which should trace the shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the expected pah emission related to the time evolution of the shell will be very useful for these observations , which should be included in future modeling .",
    "the actual molecular clouds have complex structures rather than the homogeneous density distribution assumed in this paper .",
    "below , we briefly discuss how realistic density structures affect the time evolution of the swept - up shell , pdr , as well as the h  ii region .      when the h  ii region forms near the edge of a molecular cloud , or in a cloud with the density gradient ( e.g. , @xmath140 ) , its time evolution is different from that in a homogeneous medium .",
    "the high - pressure ionized gas is hardly trapped , and flows out of the cloud @xcite .",
    "such `` blister - like '' or `` champagne flow '' features have been observed in some h  ii regions . in these regions ,",
    "only a small fraction of the swept - up gas remains in the shell , and the expanding if finally destroys the parental molecular cloud .",
    "as argued by @xcite and @xcite , the rapid ionization of the molecular gas will quench the star formation activity in the clouds .",
    "furthermore , we note that the star - forming capacity of the clouds will be limited by fuv photons as well as uv photons .",
    "unless the swept - up gas remains in the shell , stellar fuv radiation is hardly attenuated through the shell .",
    "such unshielded fuv photons dissociate molecules efficiently over a much wider region than the h  ii region , which reduces the star formation efficiency of the clouds .",
    "the dynamical expansion of the h  ii region , pdr , and the shell in a cloud with a density gradient has not been studied well , and this will be explored in our forthcoming papers .",
    "real molecular clouds generally have clumpy or hierarchical structures .",
    "the pre - existing density inhomogeneity in molecular clouds can modify the structure and the evolution of the h  ii region , pdr , and the swept - up shell .    in the h  ii region",
    ", the pre - existing clumps are gradually photoevaporated by stellar uv radiation .",
    "these clumps are basically smoothed out in the sound crossing time of each clump , which is much shorter than the dynamical time of the h  ii region , @xmath141 .    outside the h  ii region ,",
    "the pdr structure depends on how deep the fuv radiation penetrates into the molecular region . some previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has shown that the radiative transfer in a clumpy medium can be reduced to that of a homogeneous medium with the same average density and lower effective extinction . in the pdr around the h  ii region ,",
    "the fuv photons will easily seep into the molecular region , threading the clumpy structure .",
    "this will delay the sf and if overtaking the dfs , and the accumulation of molecules in the shell . in clumpy molecular clouds , on the other hand , most of the gas",
    "is thought to be contained in optically thick clumps .",
    "molecules in these opaque clumps will be protected against the fuv radiation by the self - shielding of these clumps . in order to study these two competing effects ,",
    "multi - dimensional and time - dependent calculations are needed .",
    "note , however , that our 1-d calculation has successfully explained the observed molecular abundance around sh104 ( paper i ) .",
    "thus we expect that our 1-d calculations should be a good approximation for the averaged physical quantities .",
    "observation shows that there are the supersonic turbulent motions in molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the velocity dispersion increases with the lengthscale ( @xmath142 a few km / s at about 10  pc ) , the effect becomes important with the lower ambient density .",
    "the expanding shell actually dissolves when the shell velocity becomes less than the velocity dispersion of the turbulent motion . in  5 ,",
    "we have shown that the shell velocity becomes less than a few km / s when the molecular gas accumulates in the shell with the lower - mass star . in this case",
    ", the shell will dissolve without gathering the molecular material , and the triggered star formation will not occur .",
    "we study the net feedback effect in the turbulent molecular cloud in a subsequent paper .      in this paper ,",
    "we have considered only the expanding h  ii region in the molecular cloud , which can trigger the propagation of star formation activity within the cloud .",
    "after the molecular cloud disperses due to the negative feedback from massive stars and/or the external turbulent motion , stellar uv photons spread into the diffuse neutral medium .",
    "the h  ii regions expand in the ambient neutral medium , but the sf preceding the if should also compress the neutral gas to enable the rapid reformation of molecules ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the role of the giant h  ii regions expanding in the diffuse neutral medium will be explored in our next paper , hosokawa & inutsuka ( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the time evolution of the h  ii region , pdr , and the swept - up shell around a massive star , performing the numerical calculation of radiation - hydrodynamics .",
    "following paper i , we have investigated how the time evolution changes with the different ambient number density and the luminosity ( mass ) of the central star .",
    "the basic evolution with different parameters is qualitatively similar to the fiducial one explained in paper i , but quantitatively different .",
    "we have derived some simple scaling relations , ( [ eq : rst_nsc])-([eq : jfuvi_nsc ] ) and ( [ eq : rst_ssc])-([eq : jfuvi_ssc ] ) , with which we can well understand what causes the differences among models .",
    "first , we have analyzed the dependence on the ambient number density .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    * at the typical ambient number density of gmcs , @xmath143 , the molecular gas is finally accumulated in the shell , and gravitational fragmentation is expected . *",
    "the timescale of the evolution , size of the h  ii region , and the swept - up mass in the shell quantitatively change with the different ambient number densities . with the lower number density",
    ", the h  ii region expands into the larger region over a long timescale , so that the swept - up mass in the shell is larger .",
    "the expected timescale within which the layer becomes gravitationally unstable is also longer with the lower ambient number density . *",
    "the h@xmath58 molecules rapidly accumulate in the shell , but co molecules are more sensitive to the shielding effect of fuv photons . with the lower number density , the accumulation of co molecules in the shell is delayed owing to the small column density of the shell . at @xmath144 ,",
    "the shell is dominated by co molecules before the fragmentation . at @xmath145 , however , the shell - fragmentation is expected to take place before the accumulation of co molecules . if the shell fragments into clumps with high column density , co molecules will be formed there owing to the self - shielding of clumps .",
    "next , we have analyzed the dependence on the luminosity ( mass ) of the central stars .",
    "our results are the following :    * with the central stars of @xmath146 , the molecular gas is finally accumulated in the shell , and gravitational fragmentation is expected . *",
    "the timescale of the shell - fragmentation is relatively insensitive to the luminosity of the central star . at @xmath93 ,",
    "the unstable region spreads in the shell over @xmath147  myrs with the central star of @xmath146 , whose uv and fuv luminosities differ by 2 - 4 orders of magnitude . *",
    "the maximum density of the shell is always higher with the more massive central star .",
    "this is due to the difference in the mach number of the sf . with the higher - mass star",
    ", the fuv radiation is easily shielded and the temperature in front of the sf quickly decreases , which raises the mach number .    according to the above results",
    ", we can conclude that an expanding h  ii region in homogeneous molecular gas should be an efficient trigger for star formation . once the massive star is ignited in the cloud",
    ", the star formation can propagate to the remaining molecular material around the exciting massive star .",
    "we are grateful to shin mineshige , takashi nakamura , toru tsuribe , kazu omukai , hiroshi koyama , and akira mizuta for their useful comments and encouragement .",

    "in this section , we explain the difference method for the ionization equation and the energy equation , ( [ eq : egy_ite ] ) . other rate equations are differenced in the same way as the ionization equation . for simplicity , we temporarily omit all indices and drop the frequency - dependence of the radiation field in the ionization equation , @xmath148 where @xmath149 means some processes other than photoionization ( e.g. , recombination etc )",
    ". the simplest difference form of ( [ eq : ion_simple ] ) is , @xmath150 where all physical quantities are defined at the cell center .",

    "however , this differenced form provides no reliable results .",
    "if the optical depth through the @xmath154-th cell is thick enough , @xmath159 , the uv flux at the @xmath154-th cell center , @xmath155 , significantly decreases from the uv flux at the previous cell center , @xmath160 .",
    "even if a sufficient number of uv photons reaches the cell interface at @xmath161 , only a few photons may reach the @xmath154-th cell center and the @xmath154-th cell will not be photoionized .",
    "this situation occurs at the ionization front ( if ) , where the optical depth changes sharply .",
    "the quick way to improve the scheme is to define the flux at the inner cell interface , not in the cell center .",
    "however , we adopt another more sophisticated differenced form for rate equations . with equation ( [ eq : ion_simple ] ) and radiative transfer equation ( [ eq : uvtr ] ) ,",

    "this equation assures that the number of ionized atoms per unit time is equal to that of the consumed photons per unit time in the @xmath154-th cell , if other processes , @xmath164 , are neglected .    since the ionization rate sharply changes at the if , @xmath165 should be calculated with some precision ( e .. g , * ? ? ?",

    "the ti occurs around @xmath176  k mainly at the if . if we do not include the thermal conduction , unphysical oscillation spreads from the if and the calculation does not converge",
    "therefore , we need to include the thermal conduction in the energy equation .",
    "since the field length is generally much shorter than the characteristic length scale ( e.g. , strmgren radius ) in our calculations , we adopt another available method to resolve field length .",
