    "@xcite that the su@xmath0(3 ) gauge family symmetry enables us to construct a simple gauge family model for understanding the mixing and masses of leptons .",
    "the su@xmath0(3 ) gauge family symmetry was first introduced in early time for estimating the top quark mass@xcite .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the model can provide a consistent prediction for the lepton mixing and neutrino masses when considering the appropriate vacuum structure of su@xmath0(3 ) gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "specifically , through appropriately making the su@xmath0(3 ) gauge fixing condition with keeping a residual @xmath15-permutation symmetry in the neutrino sector , we can obtain in the neutrino sector the so - called tri - bimaximal mixing matrix@xcite and largely degenerate neutrino masses , while the small mixing matrix in the charged - lepton sector is resulted by requiring the vacuum structure of spontaneous symmetry breaking to possess approximate global u(1 ) family symmetries@xcite .",
    "thus the deviation from tri - bimaximal mixing in the lepton mixing matrix is attributed to the small mixing in the charged - lepton sector , its smallness is protected by the mechanism of approximate global u(1 ) family symmetries @xcite . as the spontaneously symmetry breaking cp - violating phases in the vacuum@xcite",

    "the corresponding leptonic jarlskog cp - violating invariant quantity@xcite reaches the maximal value @xmath19 the resulting neutrino masses are largely degenerate with the value at the order @xmath20 ev with a total mass @xmath21 ev , which is much larger than the minimal limit @xmath22 ev and is expected to be tested by the future experiments .",
    "it is widely expected that the leptonic cp violation can be maximal or large enough to account for the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe via the leptogenesis mechanism as the cp violation in the sm is not enough to understand the baryogenesis . in this note",
    ", we are going to make a general analysis on the leptonic cp - violating phase and its correlation with the deviation from the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing based on the current experimental results .",
    "let us begin with the following general structure of mnsp lepton mixing matrix @xmath23 which has been expressed into the standard form with @xmath24@xcite .",
    "an interesting symmetric parametrization was discussed in@xcite . where @xmath25 is a diagonal matrix of phase factors and",
    "can be rotated away by the redefinition of charged lepton fields , and @xmath26 are the so - called majorana phases for majorana neutrinos . it is known that the lepton mixing matrix generally arises from two mixing matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 , they correspond to the charged - lepton and neutrino mixing matrices arising from diagonalizing the charged - lepton mass matrix and neutrino mass matrix respectively .",
    "when the charged - lepton mass matrix is hermitian @xmath29 with @xmath30 the diagonal mass matrix of charged leptons @xmath31 , the unitary charged - lepton mixing matrix @xmath27 can in general be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a unitary matrix with cp - violating phase @xmath34 , and mixing angles @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is a diagonal phase matrix with three phases @xmath37 , while only two relative phases @xmath38 are physically observable cp - violating phases .    for the neutrino mixing matrix , when an appropriate @xmath15-symmetric neutrino mass matrix between the second and third neutrinos is considered to have three independent matrix elements , the resulting neutrino mixing matrix is completely determined to be @xmath39 which is the so - called tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "it is noticed that when three phases @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) in the hermitian mass matrix are not independent and they are related via @xmath42 , one then has @xmath43 on the other hand , when @xmath44 is small in comparison with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 , it is easily seen that @xmath34 will not be a dominant source of leptonic cp violation as the cp - violating phase @xmath34 is associated with the mixing angle @xmath44 . in this situation",

    "the best - fit results presented in pdg@xcite are @xmath55 which slightly deviates from the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing .",
    "note that the presently extracted mixing angles from experiments are not sensitive to the cp - violating phase due to the smallness of the effects concerning the cp violation . as the leptonic cp violation is strongly correlated to the non - zero @xmath56 which characterizes the deviation from the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix",
    ", it is then interesting to investigate the leptonic cp - violating phase and its correlation with the deviation from the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing based on the above structure of lepton mixing matrix and the current experimental results .",

    ", the charged - lepton mixing matrix can be written , to the order @xmath60 , as the following form : @xmath61 where the phase matrix @xmath62 can be absorbed by the redefinitions of charged lepton fields .",
