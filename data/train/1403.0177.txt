    "the question of whether the mapping properties of singular integral operators could be extended to the lebesgue - bhner spaces @xmath4 ( @xmath1 ) of vector - valued functions was taken up by several authors in the 60 s . in @xcite ,",
    "benedek , caldern and panzone observed that the boundedness on @xmath5 for one @xmath6 of a singular integral operator , together with hrmander s condition , implies its boundedness on @xmath4 for all @xmath1 .",
    "however , to actually get the @xmath5-boundedness ( something that was immediate for @xmath7 in the scalar - valued ) , turned out to be a significantly difficult task except in the case @xmath8 for some measure space @xmath9 .",
    "the first progress made in this direction is burkholder s extension @xcite of riesz s classical theorem on the @xmath3-boundedness of the hilbert transform , where it was shown that if the underlying banach space @xmath2 satisfies the so called umd - property , then the hilbert transform is bounded on @xmath10 for any @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the umd - property was shown by bourgain @xcite to be necessary for the boundedness of the hilbert transform .",
    "it is well - known that the hilbert transform is a prototype of singular integral operators and fourier multipliers , its boundedness motivates mcconnell s @xcite and zimmermann s @xcite results on vector - valued marcinkiewicz - mihlin multipliers , and hytnen and weis s @xcite results on vector - valued singular convolution integrals .",
    "particularly , if @xmath2 equals @xmath11the schatten class , the @xmath12-boundedness is called complete @xmath3-boundedness in the light of noncommutative harmonic analysis . in this setting , the complete @xmath13-boundedness is immediately available because @xmath14 is a hilbert space , and the fourier transform ( or almost orthogonality principle ) can be adapted . in order to obtain the complete @xmath3-boundedness ,",
    "so far as we know in the noncommutative harmonic analysis , there are only two ways .",
    "one way is to establish firstly the weak type @xmath15 estimate , and then to use interpolation and the duality argument . in this way",
    ", the convolution kernel need to satisfy the lipschitz regularity in order to conduct the pseudo - localization principle as done in @xcite ( see also @xcite for related results ) .",
    "the other way is to get @xmath16 ( the noncommutative bmo space ) estimate , then to use interpolation and the duality argument . in this case",
    ", the kernel is required to satisfy the hrmander s condition as done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , to get the complete @xmath3-boundedness is not a trivial work when the kernel does not satisfy the lipschitz regularity and the hrmander condition , see e.g. @xcite for more information .",
    "the purpose of our project is to extend the vector - valued singular integrals theory to more general setting .",
    "we consider vector - valued singular radon transforms , which are given by the following principal - valued integral @xmath17 where @xmath2 is a banach space , @xmath18 is a caldern - zygmund kernel in @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a surface in @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "precisely , we are interested in the boundedness of @xmath24 on @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath2 is some banach space .",
    "obviously , @xmath24 are classical vector - valued singular convolution integrals if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and related results have been introduced in the previous paragraphs .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath29 , @xmath24 are classical singular integrals associated to surfaces , which have been well - studied by stein , nagel , wainger , christ and so on , see @xcite for a survey of results through 1978 and @xcite through 1999 .    in the present paper , we start with the investigation of hilbert transforms along curves in the hope of providing the insight and inspiration for subsequent development of this subject , as the role played by the classical hilbert transform in the classical vector - valued caldern - zygmund theory .",
    "vector - valued hilbert transforms along curves are defined by @xmath30 in the scalar - valued case , the @xmath13-boundedness goes back the work @xcite of fabes who proved it with @xmath31 using complex integration . then stein and wainger @xcite obtained the @xmath13-boundedness for all homogeneous curves by using van der corput s estimates for trigonometric integrals .",
    "the first breakthrough was the proof of the @xmath3-boundedness in the papers of nagel , rivire and wainger @xcite as well as the paper of nagel and wainger @xcite using stein s complex interpolation . since then , many related results have been obtained , see stein and wainger s survey paper @xcite for the curves having some curvature at the origin , the paper of carlsson _ et al _ @xcite and the references therein for the flat curves in @xmath32 .",
    "however , all results about vector - valued singular integrals mentioned previously can not be directly applied to hilbert transforms along curves on @xmath33 , because they are no longer caldern - zygmund operators .",
    "therefore this study is a move beyond the vector - valued caldern - zygmund theory .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend nagel , rivire and wainger as well as nagel and wainger s results mentioned above to the vector - valued setting by combining their original arguments and some idea developed recently by hytnen and weis @xcite in the vector - valued caldern - zygmund theory .",
    "to state our results , we need to recall and introduce some notations .",

    "let @xmath38 be the corresponding expectation .",
    "the main banach space geometry property of @xmath2 we are concerned in this paper is the umd property ( see e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. the following inequality holds : @xmath39 for all @xmath40 , all fixed signs @xmath41 , all @xmath2-valued martingale differences @xmath42 .",

    "the previous remark , theorem [ main result ] implies the complete boundedness of hilbert transforms along this kind of curves which is of independent interest in the operator space theory .",
    "this result also partially generalize the previous result by rubio de francia , ruiz and torra @xcite where they obtained theorem [ main result ] in the case @xmath66 with @xmath67 . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors used indirectly benedek , caldern and panzone s strategy mentioned previously . while the proof of theorem [ main result ] is motivated by the recent development in the vector - valued caldern - zygmund theory @xcite ,",
