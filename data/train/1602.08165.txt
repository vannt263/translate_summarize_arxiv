    "extensive work has been dedicated to the study of the electroweak phase transition in the standard model ( sm ) as well as in many of its extensions .",
    "this interest is based for a large part on the possibility that it might explain the baryon asymmetry in the universe and that this asymmetry could be produced at around the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking in the primordial hot big bang universe ( for reviews see , e.g. , ref .",
    "one of the necessary conditions for a model to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe is the presence of nonequilibrium effects . in a phase transition , this can be achieved if the transition is first - order and its strength is strong enough , in what is usually called a strong first - order phase transition .",
    "this condition is parameterized by the ratio @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the value for the degenerate vacuum for the higgs field at the critical temperature @xmath6 .",
    "a strong first - order phase transition is usually characterized by the condition @xmath7 . in the sm",
    "this condition can not be achieved .",
    "lattice monte carlo numerical simulations of the electroweak standard model  @xcite have shown that there is an endpoint in the phase diagram of the model for a higgs mass @xmath8 gev , where the phase transition is weak first - order as the endpoint is approached from the left and the transition becomes a smooth crossover for larger higgs masses .",
    "according to recent results from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , from the current combined results from atlas and cms experiments   have indicated the existence of a higgs boson with a mass @xmath9 gev .",
    "thus , this gives no hope of achieving the necessary conditions for producing a baryon asymmetry in the context of the sm , since no significant departure from thermal equilibrium can be obtained during the phase transition dynamics .",
    "this is one of the motivations for looking for extensions of the sm and/or alternative models and the searches for new scalar particles at the lhc , aiming to reveal the ingredients needed for the strong first - order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , as required to produce the resulting observed baryon asymmetry .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "some extensions of the sm have been analyzed and the kind of scalar was selected so as to remedy the sm shortcomings .",
    "these extensions used to enhance the sm are usually constructed with a scalar gauge singlet  @xcite , a complex scalar or a scalar from supersymmetric degrees of freedom ( in the context of supersymmetry extensions of the sm )  @xcite . on the other hand , there are alternative models , with a larger particle spectrum than the sm , that predict the existence of new gauge bosons and exotic quarks that acquire mass from their couplings to new scalar fields . in particular",
    ", in this paper , we are exploring the phenomenological aspects of an alternative to the sm based on the @xmath10 gauge symmetry , commonly known as the 3 - 3 - 1 model  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the scalars are accommodated in a convenient fundamental representation of the @xmath1 symmetry group . from the electric charge operator",
    "one can select its model version .",
    "one particular version predicts the existence of new very massive gauge bosons and exotic quarks . in this work ,",
    "we want to study and better understand the possible phase transition sequences associated with the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath11 in the 3 - 3 - 1 model and whether it can produce the necessary conditions required for generating a baryon asymmetry .",
    "let us outline some features of the model .",
    "although at low energies the model has the same spectrum as the sm , it offers an explanation for basic open questions to the sm . in this model , the family replication problem is solved when considering that all three families are required for the anomaly cancellation procedure , resulting in the number of fermion families to have to be a multiple of the quark color number . considering that the qcd asymptotic freedom condition is valid",
    "only if the number of families of quarks is less than five , one concludes that there are three generations",
    ". another interesting feature of the minimal version of the model is the prediction of an upper bound for the weinberg angle , which follows from a peculiar relation between new gauge boson masses .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ 331model ] , we present the main ingredients of the 3 - 3 - 1 model related to the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "we give a brief exposition of its gauge , scalar and fermionic sectors , with a description of its spectrum of particles and its main motivations for us seeing it as an interesting and natural extension of the standard model .",
    "we also introduce the more general potential compatible with the given symmetry . in sec .",
    "[ scalarspectrum ] , we obtain the scalar spectrum after the ssb , explicitly showing the combination of the scalar fields transferring mass to the massive gauge bosons . in sec .",
    "[ 1loopsection ] , we give the expression for the quantum and thermal corrections at the one - loop order to the tree - level potential for the model . in sec .",
    "[ ptpattern ] , we analyze and characterize the structure of symmetry breaking patterns in the model and we discuss our strategy for fixing the many parameters of the model so as to maximize the possibility of finding a strong first - order phase transition .",
    "we study the temperature - dependent one - loop corrected potential as a function of each value expectation value of the background fields and we graphically identify the temperature corresponding to symmetry restoration . from this analysis of the temperature dependence of the one - loop corrected model spectrum ,",
    "we conclude that , in the 3 - 3 - 1 model , it shows two scales for first - order phase transition , with the final one , corresponding to the usual electroweak phase transition , as being very weak first - order , or probably second - order in practice . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we give our concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we recall the main characteristics of the minimal version of the 3 - 3 - 1 model @xcite related to the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .",

    "we impose the consistency of the model with the sm phenomenology by adopting @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 gives the energy scale for the symmetry breaking @xmath35 , which is usually assumed to be at the tev scale , for consistency with the current observations  @xcite .",

    "as already observed , the model has a too large number of free parameters , which makes it an almost impossible job to study the complete parameter region allowed . since our objective in this work is to determine whether a strong first - order phase transition in the model is possible , our strategy for fixing the many couplings",
    "is then chosen so as to maximize this goal .",
    "for this purpose , we can borrow some of the lessons already learned when studying the phase transition in the sm and other extensions of it ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "to satisfy the usual criterion for a strong first - order phase transition , namely that the ratio of the field expectation value at the critical temperature and the critical temperature be larger than one , @xmath146 , we need , optimally , either a larger vev at @xmath6 and/or a small @xmath6 .",
    "typically @xmath6 is constrained by the scale , @xmath147 , which for us is rather large ( recalling that @xmath148 tev and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constrained by the weinberg scale . since in general the vev is given in terms of a combination of couplings and masses , @xmath149 , an ideally situation is to try to work with the smallest couplings possible .",
    "there is , however , a trade off .",
    "too small couplings lead in general to a light particle spectrum , which for us is still limited by the scales and observational bounds ( in particular , other scalars than the sm higgs are expected to be sufficiently heavy for not being detected yet ) .",
    "the higgs mass @xmath90 itself is the only limiting observational quantity we have in the scalar sector . since the higgs is a mass eigenvalue for the _ cp-_even scalar neutral matrix , eq .",
    "( [ cpeven ] ) , it only ( weakly ) constrains the couplings @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath74 .    in the analysis",
    "below , we fix @xmath152 gev and work with four different sets of choices for couplings .",
    "other possibilities can be shown to fall in one of these sets . in each of the sets used , we look for the ideal conditions for having a strong first - order phase transition , which , as mentioned above , favors the smallest choice of couplings in general . in all the sets we consider below",
    ", we found more convenient to vary the inter - couplings between the different fields , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , due to their relation to the sm higgs mass ( the other inter - couplings @xmath155 and @xmath156 , only appear on the heavy charged scalars and are unconstrained by the higgs ) .",
    "we will consider the following four large sets of parameters :    \\(a ) set i : the couplings @xmath157 , with @xmath158 , such that @xmath159 varied together with @xmath160 ;    \\(b ) set ii : the couplings @xmath157 , with @xmath161 , such that @xmath159 varied together with @xmath162 ;    \\(c ) set iii : the couplings @xmath157 , with @xmath163 , such that @xmath159 varied together with @xmath154 ;    \\(d ) set iv : the couplings @xmath157 , with @xmath164,such that @xmath159 and @xmath165 , which are then varied .",
    "for all sets we have fixed @xmath75 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that @xmath74 determines the asymmetry of the potential in the @xmath22 direction and the more asymmetrical is the potential , the more we expect to have a stronger first - order phase transition .",
    "note also that values of couplings larger than one can make us enter in a nonperturbative regime of parameters .",
    "we avoid this situation here , since we work only at the one - loop level for the effective potential for the model ( see next section ) .",
    "in particular , we have explicitly checked that smaller values of @xmath74 always lead to weaker transitions .",
    "in addition , for each of the sets explained above , we have chosen to work with the higher energy scale @xmath34 with values @xmath166 , 4 and 5 tev , satisfying the current constraints on the @xmath125 mass , as already mentioned . likewise , for the projection angle @xmath85 , we have considered for each of the sets and values of the scale , the three values @xmath167 .",
    "again , we have explicitly verified that larger asymmetries on the @xmath168 and @xmath70 directions are either disfavored , or there is a trade off , since as we decrease the projection in one direction , there is a compensation by the increase of the projection in the other direction ( recalling again that @xmath168 and @xmath70 are constrained by the weinberg scale @xmath95 ) .",
    "nonetheless , our analysis shows that the symmetrical case @xmath169 , i.e. , @xmath170 , tends to be favored as far as the strength of the transition is concerned .",
    "each one of the parameters in the above four sets is then chosen so as to satisfy the higgs mass @xmath152 gev .",
    "the resulting relations between these couplings subject to this constraint are shown in figs .",

    "[ figsets ] that for sets ii , iii and iv , there are always minimal values for the couplings . in the case of the set i , @xmath157 is a decreasing function of @xmath160 .    for illustration , the resulting scalar mass spectrum in each set",

    "we have explicitly verified that the values of @xmath189 specified correspond to the _ minimum _ possible critical temperature found within the range of couplings shown in fig .",
    "[ figsets ] . changing the values of the couplings away from the minimum values satisfying the higgs mass constraint always tend to increase the value of @xmath189 and , consequently , decrease the ratio @xmath190 .",
    "the same is true in general for @xmath191 , except for the case of set i , where we find that decreasing the value of the coupling @xmath160 , @xmath191 tends to decrease , thus increasing the ratio @xmath192 , but the minimum values of @xmath191 we have found are still limited by the minimum values shown in table  [ tabtc ] , and @xmath193 .",
    "this then implies that the results for the second transition , corresponding to @xmath98 , has values for the ratio @xmath192 that are always much smaller than one , which characterizes a very weak first - order , possibly second - order , phase transition .",
    "we have explicitly verified that by increasing the scale @xmath34 it causes very little changes to the second transition .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the higher is @xmath34 , the sooner the heavier particles decouple from the sm electroweak spectrum .",
    "we also note that closer to the transition point it also known that self - energy corrections to the effective potential can make the transition even weaker  @xcite .     and @xmath136 for the set iv case of parameters and for @xmath194 .",

    "the ratio @xmath196 tends to be closer to one , becoming larger when the scale increases . among the different sets of parameters we have considered ,",

    "note , however , looking at the values for the scalar mass spectrum shown in table  [ spectrum ] , this is also the case that leads to the smallest mass for the higgs like scalar particle @xmath114 , with a mass @xmath199 gev . increasing the scale @xmath200 this value of the mass also increases .",

    "this allowed us to make a systematic ( though far from complete , it should be sufficiently representative for our purposes in this work ) investigation the two symmetry transitions in the model , the @xmath213 and the standard electroweak one , @xmath98 .    on studying the temperature effects on the effective potential at the one - loop level , and within the approximations used , we have shown that the model encodes two first - order phase transitions .",
    "the last one , corresponding to the standard electroweak phase transition , @xmath98 , turns out to be always very weak , most likely turning into a second - order or a crossover in practice . for the first transition , corresponding to @xmath89",
    ", we find that there are regions of parameters that can favor a strong first - order phase transition and , in particular , we have found that the critical temperature in this case is always close to the mass of the higgs like scalar @xmath114 .",
    "this indicates that we can use the estimated value for the mass @xmath214 as a reasonable estimate for the temperature of transition @xmath189 .",
    "our results should be contrasted with some previous analyses of the phase transition performed in some variants of the 3 - 3 - 1 model done in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have used the so - called reduced minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the economical 3 - 3 - 1 model was used .",
    "these models differ from the one we have used in the present work in the sense that they have a reduced number of couplings in the potential for only two scalar triplets interactions .",
    "the economical 3 - 3 - 1 model has a much richer leptonic content than the reduced minimal version and both versions exclude quarks with exotic electric charges .",
    "the ssb mechanism applied for determining how each ordinary or new gauge boson acquires the mass follows the same road as usual , the goldstone bosons are identified , but no numerical value for the masses of the scalars have been shown . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors find parameter regimes where strong first - order phase transitions are found for both the @xmath215 and also for the @xmath98 transitions .",
    "this discrepancy as regards the strength of the predicted two step phase transition in these alternative models with our present results deserves an interpretation .",
    "we believe that the most important source for the difference between our results and the previous ones come from the fact that in refs .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that only one field direction would contribute at each transition , e.g. , with @xmath216 in the first transition along the @xmath25 direction and with @xmath217 in the second transition along the @xmath69 direction . while this is basically true in the first case ,",
    "where the temperature is sufficiently high to have @xmath218 , this is not the case for the second transition . as we have explained in sec .",
    "[ ptpattern ] , in the first transition the electroweak phase would still be in its symmetry restored phase for temperatures @xmath219 , thus @xmath220 . however , for the second transition , the temperature is already low enough , @xmath221 , so that @xmath222 and all the heavy particles that make the extra particle spectrum of the 3 - 3 - 1 model acquire masses close to their vacuum values decoupling from the particle spectrum ( e.g. , their temperature - dependent contributions to the effective potential become all boltzmann suppressed ) .",
    "the particle content at these low values of the temperature is then dominated essentially by that of the standard model . as such",
    ", we expect the results not to differ strongly from the ones known for the phase transition in the standard model .",
    "that the heavy mass particles of the 3 - 3 - 1 model contributes little at the electroweak phase transition is confirmed by the results .",
    "we have found in all cases of sets of parameters considered here that the critical temperature @xmath191 , as well the ratio @xmath223 , are very weakly dependent on the scale @xmath34 , which controls the masses of the heavy particles .",
    "our results show that using the parameter set iv , in particular for @xmath194 , can lead to a very low critical temperature for the first transition . in particular ,",
    "we have obtained the result that , for all parameters studied , @xmath210 within around @xmath211 .",
    "this result and the possibility of having a critical temperature @xmath189 not too high above that for the ewpt , @xmath191 , are deserving of further analysis in the future and may have for this model important implications as regards astroparticle physics and cosmology .",
