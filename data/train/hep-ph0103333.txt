    "the aim of this work is to investigate the phenomenological implications of a model recently proposed for the electroweak interactions based on a @xmath0 confining theory @xcite .",
    "we shall concentrate on orbital and radial excitations of the electroweak bosons .",
    "our model makes use of the confinement mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "it was emphasized in ref.@xcite that models of a similar class imply different search strategies for the higgs boson than those usually adopted when searching for the standard model , supersymmetric or fermiophobic higgs bosons .    in our model",
    "the left - handed particles appear as bound states of fundamental , unobservable fermions @xmath2 and @xmath3 and a scalar @xmath4 .",
    "these particles transform as doublets under @xmath0 .",
    "besides this , @xmath3 is a triplet under @xmath5 .",
    "we can then identify the following physical left - handed fermions , higgs boson and electroweak bosons .",
    "@xmath6 assuming a @xmath0 confinement .",
    "the right - handed particles are those of the standard model . in our approach",
    "the electroweak bosons appear as excited states of the higgs boson .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the minimal sector of the model , i.e. , the sector containing only the particles predicted by the standard model , is identical to the standard model @xcite if one chooses the unitary gauge , we call this property duality .",
    "this is done by fixing the gauge and performing a @xmath7 expansion , where @xmath8 gev is the scale of the theory . in this model",
    "new particles corresponding to exotic particles like leptoquarks can be introduced .",
    "but , they do not obey to this expansion , and the duality can not be applied to describe their properties .",
    "forces between two fermions can be very much different than those between a fermion and a scalar or between two scalars . if leptoquarks do exist , their mass scale is presumably very high .    of particular interest are radially excited versions of the higgs boson @xmath9 and of the electroweak bosons @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "as described in @xcite , the most promising candidates for energies available at the lhc or at future linear colliders are the excited states of the higgs boson and of the electroweak bosons .",
    "especially the orbital excitation , i.e. , the spin 2 @xmath12-waves @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , of the electroweak bosons have a well defined @xmath7 expansion ( we use the unitary gauge : @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the covariant derivative , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the gauge fields and @xmath21 the coupling constant corresponding to the gauge group @xmath0 . although the masses and the couplings of these electroweak @xmath12-waves to other particles are fixed by the dynamics of the model , it is difficult to determine these parameters .",
    "in analogy to quantum chromodynamics , it is expected that these @xmath12-waves couple with a reasonable strength to the corresponding @xmath22-waves , the electroweak bosons . in the following ,",
    "we assume in accordance with the duality property , that the @xmath12-waves only couple to the electroweak bosons and not to the photon , higgs boson or the fermions .",
    "the cross - sections and decay width of @xmath12-waves predicted in a variety of composite models were considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we shall consider different effective couplings of our electroweak @xmath12-waves that are more suitable for the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "if their masses are of the order of the scale of the theory , they will be accessible at the lhc .",
    "of particular interest is the neutral electroweak @xmath12-wave because it is expected to couple to the @xmath23 electroweak bosons .",
    "this particle can thus be produced by the fusion of two electroweak bosons at the lhc or at linear colliders .",
    "we shall use the formalism developed by van dam and veltman @xcite for massive @xmath12-waves to compute the decay width of the @xmath13 into @xmath24 .",
    "we use the following relation : @xmath25 for the sum over the polarizations @xmath26 of the @xmath12-wave . in the notation of ref.@xcite the sum over the polarizations of the @xmath23",
    "is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the euclidean metric .",
    "averaging over the polarizations of the @xmath12-wave , we obtain @xmath29 with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mass of the @xmath12-wave and @xmath32 is a dimensionfull coupling constant with @xmath33=\\mbox{gev}$ ] . a dimensionless coupling constant",
    "is obtained by a redefinition of the coupling constant @xmath34 .",
    "we shall discuss plausible numerical inputs in the next section .",
    "assuming that the @xmath35 boson couples with the same strength to the @xmath12-wave as the @xmath36-bosons , we can approximate the decay width into @xmath35 bosons in the following way @xmath37 with @xmath38 . the breit - wigner resonance cross section for the reaction",
    "@xmath39 thus reads ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the total decay width of the neutral @xmath12-wave . due to the background",
    ", the @xmath36 bosons might be difficult to observe .",
    "but , if the electroweak @xmath12-waves states are produced we expect an excess of @xmath35 bosons compared to the standard model expectation .",
    "note that the @xmath35 bosons are easier to observe .    as we shall see in the next section",
    ", the neutral @xmath12-waves give a sizable contribution to the reaction @xmath1 .",
    "a considerable attention has been paid to the scattering of electroweak bosons since this represents a stringent test of the gauge structure of the standard model . in particular the reaction @xmath43",
    "is known to be of prime interest .",
    "if the higgs boson is heavier than 1 tev , the electroweak bosons will start to interact strongly @xcite .",
    "this reaction has been studied in the framework of the standard model in ref . @xcite and",
    "the one loop corrections were considered in @xcite and are known to be sizable . for the sake of this paper the tree level diagrams are sufficient to show that the contribution of the neutral electroweak @xmath12-wave will have a considerable impact to that reaction and can not be overlooked in forthcoming experiments . as described in @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) the @xmath36 s emitted by the beam particles are dominantly longitudinally polarized if the following relations are fulfilled : @xmath44 at an @xmath45 @xmath46 collider , and @xmath47 at a hadron collider , and we shall only consider the especially interesting reaction @xmath48 as described in @xcite .    in the standard model , this reaction is a test of the gauge structure of the theory @xcite .",

    "we shall now consider the contribution of the radially @xmath72 and orbitally @xmath73 excited neutral @xmath35 boson .",

    ", we impose a cut of @xmath83 , which is the cut chosen in ref .",
    "the spin of the particle can be determined from the angular distribution of the cross section .",
    "we have neglected the decay width of the @xmath35 boson and that of the higgs boson since we assume that the energy of the process is such that no @xmath35 boson or higgs resonance appear . for numerical estimates",
    ", we took @xmath84 gev .",
    "we have considered only the reaction involving longitudinally polarized @xmath36 .",
    "the amplitudes for different polarizations for the standard model can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes for a @xmath9 or a @xmath85 can be deduced from the standard model calculations by replacing the masses , the decay widths and the coupling constants .",
    "those for the neutral @xmath12-wave can be easily calculated using    @xmath86    and @xmath87 where @xmath88 stands for the polarization and also using the following relations @xmath89 valid in the center of mass system where @xmath90 is the energy of the @xmath36 bosons , @xmath91 is their momentum and @xmath58 is the scattering angle .",
    "the differential decay widths for the reaction @xmath92 can be found in figure [ dwave ] for the reaction involving the neutral @xmath12-wave , figure [ zprime ] for that involving the @xmath85 spin 1 boson and figure [ hstar ] for that involving the @xmath71 scalar . the particles @xmath85 and @xmath71",
    "are assumed to couple , in a first approximation , only to the @xmath36 s .",
    "this allows to compute their decay rates using standard model formulas .",
    "as mentioned previously it is not an easy task to predict the mass spectrum of the model , thus we assumed , for numerical illustration , three different masses : 350 gev , 500 gev and 800 gev .",
    "the coupling constants are assumed to sizable ( see figures ) .",
    "if the cross sections are extrapolated to very high energies , the unitarity is violated . however , as expected in any substructure models , it will be restored by bound states effects .",
    "it is very instructive to plot the ratio of the differential cross section involving new physics to the standard model differential cross section .",
    "we have done so for the neutral @xmath12-wave ( ref .",
    "[ div ] ) .",
    "it is obvious from this picture that any deviation from the standard model , even at high energy will manifest it - self already in a deviation from one for that ratio . already at an energy which is low compared to the mass of the new particle ,",
    "i.e. well bellow the resonance , one observes a deviation from unity .",
    "nevertheless the calculation of the full reaction e.g. @xmath93 involves the convolution of the cross section of the reaction @xmath94 with functions describing the radiative emission of the @xmath36 s from the fermions .",
    "when this integral is performed some sensitivity is lost .",
    "nevertheless the effects are expected to be so large that they can not be overlooked .",
    "the reaction will allow to test a mass range of a few tev s so that even if the new particles are too massive to be produced on - shell , their effects will be noticeable at future colliders .",
    "we have discussed the production of a neutral @xmath12-wave @xmath95 at the lhc or at a linear collider .",
    "if the mass of this particle is of the order of the scale of the theory , i.e. 300 gev , it can be produced at these colliders .",
    "we have also shown that this particle as well as radial excitations of the higgs boson and @xmath35 boson would spoil the cancellation of the leading powers in @xmath55 of in the reaction @xmath96 , thus any new particle contributing to that reaction will have a large impact already at energies well below the mass of this new particle .",
    "this reaction is thus not only of prime interest if the higgs boson is heavy but should also be studied if the higgs boson was light .",
