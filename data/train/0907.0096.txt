    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will start - up very soon colliding protons to protons . the full @xmath0  tev design energy run will operate with an initial low luminosity of @xmath1@xmath2s@xmath3 ( equivalent to @xmath4  fb@xmath3/year integrated luminosity ) and then it will pass to a second phase of @xmath5  fb@xmath3/year .",
    "the production cross section of top - antitop quark pairs at lhc is about @xmath6  pb at @xmath4  tev , and @xmath7  pb at 14  tev  @xcite .",
    "the lhc will produce even in the first phase of operation a sample of @xmath8-pairs equivalent to the sample already collected at tevatron during its whole life , and millions of top - antitop quark pairs in the next runs .",
    "this will allow not only to measure better some of the properties of the top quark , such as mass and cross section , but also to explore with unprecedented huge statistics the existence of new physics at the tev energy scale in the top quark sector .    at leading order in the strong coupling @xmath9 the differential distributions of top and antitop quarks",
    ". this feature changes , however , due to higher order corrections  @xcite , which predict at @xmath10 a charge asymmetry of top versus antitop quarks .",
    "the inclusive charge asymmetry receives contributions from two reactions : radiative corrections to quark - antiquark annihilation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qqbar ] ) and interference between different amplitudes contributing to gluon - quark scattering @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the latter contribution is , in general , much smaller than the former .",
    "gluon - gluon fusion remains charge symmetric . at tevatron",
    ", this asymmetry is equivalent to a forward  backward asymmetry and qcd predicts that the size of the inclusive charge asymmetry is 5 to 8%  @xcite , with top quarks ( antitop quarks ) more abundant in the direction of the incoming proton ( antiproton ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental data  @xcite , but more statistic is needed to reduce the errors . at lhc , the total forward ",
    "backward asymmetry vanishes trivially because the proton - proton initial state is symmetric .",
    "nevertheless , a charge asymmetry is still visible in suitably defined distributions  @xcite .",
    "top quark production at lhc is dominated by gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath13 at @xmath4  tev , and @xmath14 at @xmath15  tev ) , which is charge symmetric under higher order corrections .",
    "the charge antisymmetric contributions to top quark production are thus screened at lhc due to the prevalence of gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "this is the main handicap for that measurement .",
    "the amount of events initiated by gluon - gluon collisions can nevertheless be suppressed with respect to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 processes , the source of the charge asymmetry , by introducing a lower cut on the invariant mass of the top - antitop quark system @xmath18 ; this eliminates the region of lower longitudinal momentum fraction of the colliding partons , where the gluon density is much larger than the quark densities .",
    "the charge asymmetry of the selected data samples is then enhanced , although at the price of lowering the statistics .",
    "this is , in principle , not a problem at lhc , where the high luminosity will compensate by far this reduction .",
    "several models predict the existence of heavy colored resonances decaying to top quarks that might be observed at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "those resonances will appear as a peak in the invariant mass distribution of the top - antitop quark pair located at the mass of the new resonance .",
    "some of those exotic gauge bosons , such as the axigluons  @xcite , might generate at tree - level a charge asymmetry too , through the interference with the @xmath19 standard model ( sm ) amplitude  @xcite .",
    "gluon - gluon fusion to top quarks stays , at first order , unaltered by the presence of new interactions because a pair of gluons do not couple to a single extra resonance in this kind of models  @xcite .",
    "to discover those resonances , hence , it is necessary to select top - antitop quark events with large invariant masses ; i.e. in the vicinity of the mass of the new resonance . a sizable charge asymmetry can also be obtained only if gluon - gluon fusion is sufficiently suppressed , that is at large values of @xmath18 . because the top quarks of those data samples will be produced highly boosted , they will be observed as a single monojet .",
    "the standard reconstruction algorithms that are based on the reconstruction of the decays products , however , loose efficiency very rapidly at high transverse momentum . for @xmath20",
    "gev new identification techniques are necessary .",
    "this has motivated many recent investigations  @xcite aimed at distinguishing top quark jets from the light quark qcd background by exploiting the jet substructure , without identifying the decay products .",
    "in our work  @xcite we find that for a measurement at lhc of the top quark charge asymmetry it is not necessary to select events with very large invariant masses of the top - antitop quark pairs .",
    "we show that the highest statistical significance occurs with moderate selection cuts .",
    "indeed , we find that the measurement of the charge asymmetry induced by qcd is better suited in the region of low top - antitop quark pair invariant masses .",
    "the higher statistics in this region compensates the smallness of the charge asymmetry .",
    "we also investigate the charge asymmetry generated by the exchange of a heavy color - octet resonance .",
    "we study the scenario where the massive extra gauge boson have arbitrary flavour independent vector and axial - vector couplings to quarks .",
    "this includes the case of the axigluon that we have already analyzed in ref .",
    "top quark production at lhc is forward ",
    "backward symmetric in the laboratory frame as a consequence of the symmetric colliding proton - proton initial state .",
    "the charge asymmetry can be studied nevertheless by selecting appropriately chosen kinematic regions .",
    "the production cross section of top quarks is , however , dominated by gluon - gluon fusion and thus the charge asymmetry generated from the @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) reactions is small in most of the kinematic phase - space .",
    "nonetheless , qcd predicts at lhc a slight preference for centrally produced antitop quarks , with top quarks more abundant at very large positive and negative rapidities  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the single particle inclusive distributions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks can be understood easily . due to the proton composition in terms of quarks , production of @xmath26",
    "is dominated by initial quarks with large momentum fraction and antiquarks with small momentum fraction .",
    "qcd predicts that top ( antitop ) quarks are preferentially emitted in the direction of the incoming quarks ( antiquarks ) in the partonic rest frame as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asym1 ]  ( left graphs ) .",
    "the boost into the laboratory frame  squeezes  the top mainly in the forward and backward directions , while antitops are left more abundant in the central region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : asym1 ] , right graphs ) .",
    "+    we select events in a given range of rapidity @xmath27 and define the integrated charge asymmetry in the central region as  @xcite : a_c(y_c ) =  .[eq : acyc ] the central asymmetry @xmath28 obviously vanishes if the whole rapidity spectrum is integrated , while a non - vanishing asymmetry can be obtained over a finite interval of rapidity . since more antitop quarks are present in the central region ( low @xmath27 ) , we expect the asymmetry to be negative .",
    "we also perform a cut on the invariant mass of the top - antitop quark pair , @xmath29 , because that region of the phase space is more sensitive to the quark - antiquark induced events rather than the gluon - gluon ones , so that the asymmetry is enhanced .",
    "the main virtue of the central asymmetry is that it vanishes exactly for parity - conserving processes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_qcd_yc ]  ( left plot ) we show the central charge asymmetry at @xmath15  tev as a function of the maximum rapidity @xmath30 for two different values of the cut on the invariant mass of the top - antitop quark pair @xmath31gev , and @xmath32  tev , respectively .",
    "as expected , the central charge asymmetry is negative , is larger for larger values of the cut @xmath33 , and vanishes for large values of @xmath30 .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_qcd_yc ]  ( right plot ) the corresponding statistical significance @xmath34 of the measurement , defined as ^sm = a_c^sm =  , where @xmath35 denotes the total integrated luminosity for which we take @xmath36  fb@xmath3 at @xmath0  tev , accordingly to the first lhc schedule , .",
    "the maximum significance is reached at @xmath37 for @xmath31gev , and at @xmath38 for @xmath39  tev .",
    "surprisingly , although the size of the asymmetry is greater for the larger value of @xmath33 , its statistical significance is higher for the lower cut .",
    "this is a very interesting feature because softer top and antitop quarks should be identified more easily than the very highly boosted ones .",
    "we now fix the value of the maximum rapidity to @xmath38 and study the size of the asymmetry and its statistical significance as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_qcd_mtt_14tev ] for @xmath0  tev and @xmath36  fb@xmath3 .",
    "we find that the asymmetry increases for larger values of @xmath33 , while the statistical significance is larger without introducing any selection cut .",
    "note that the size of the asymmetry decreases again above @xmath40  tev because in that region the @xmath17 events compensate the asymmetry generated by the @xmath16 events ; their contributions are of opposite sign .",
    "although we have not taken into account experimental efficiencies , we can conclude that @xmath4  fb@xmath3 of data at the design energy of the lhc seems to be enough for a clear measurement of the qcd asymmetry .",
    "we study here the charge asymmetry produced at lhc by the decay of a color - octet resonance @xmath41 to top quarks , in the scenario where the vector @xmath42 and axial - vector @xmath43 couplings are flavour independent .",
    "we evaluate the central asymmetry in , and its statistical significance , defined as  @xcite ^g =  , for different values of the couplings and the kinematical cuts .",
    "the corresponding differential cross section is given in of the appendix .",
    "the charge asymmetry is built up from the two contributions of the differential partonic cross section that are odd in the polar angle .",
    "the first one arises from the interference with the gluon amplitude , and is proportional to the product of the axial - vector couplings of the light and the top quarks .",
    "this contribution , provided that the product of couplings is positive , is negative in the forward direction for invariant masses of the top - antitop quark pair below the resonance mass , and changes sign above . at lhc , because of the boost into the laboratory frame ( cf .",
    "discussion in section  [ sec : qcdlhc ] ) , this means that a positive central asymmetry is found for values of the cut in the invariant mass of the top - antitop quark pair below the mass of the resonance and a negative asymmetry above .",
    "this means that the asymmetry has to vanish at a certain intermediate value of that cut , close to and below the resonance mass .    the second contribution , arising from the squared amplitude of the heavy resonance , although always positive for positive couplings , is suppressed with respect to the contribution of the interference term by two powers of the resonance mass .",
    "for large values of the vector couplings , however , it might compensate the interference contribution , then leading to a positive contribution in the forward region .    in summary , we expect to find two maxima in the statistical significance as a function of @xmath44",
    ". starting from the threshold , where the asymmetry is small because gluon - gluon fusion dominates there , the size of the central asymmetry will grow by increasing @xmath45 , as the quark - antiquark annihilation process becomes more and more important . since the asymmetry induced by the excited gluon will vanish at a certain critical point",
    ", its statistical significance will do as well , and will reach a maximum at an intermediate value between that critical point and the threshold . above the critical point , the asymmetry becomes negative and its statistical significance increases again , until the event yield becomes too small .",
    "a second maximum in the statistical significance will be generated there .",
    "for certain values of the vector couplings , however , the contribution from the squared amplitude of the exotic resonance is greater than the interference term . in this case",
    ", the central asymmetry generated by the exotic resonance will be negative exclusively , and we will find only one maximum in the statistical significance .    in our first analysis we shall determine the value of the maximum rapidity @xmath30 that maximizes the statistical significance .",
    "we fix the resonance mass at @xmath46 tev , and impose two different cuts on the invariant mass of the top - antitop quark pair , namely @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we choose as an example the axigluon case : @xmath49 , @xmath50 . in fig",
    "[ fig : lhc_kk_yc_14tev ] , we present the results obtained for the central asymmetry and the statistical significance at @xmath15 tev centre - of - mass energy .",
    "we notice that the central asymmetry suffers a change of sign by passing from the lower cut to the higher one .",
    "this means that it will vanish for a given value of the cut , thus making the statistical significance vanishing also .    by looking at the corresponding significance",
    "we find that @xmath38 is a good choice for any value of the couplings .",
    "thus , we use this value to find the best cut for the top - antitop quark pair invariant mass . in order to do that",
    ", we choose several values of the parameters and we study the trend of the significance as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "we show again the results for the axigluon case , in fig [ fig : lhc_kk_gvga_14tev ] .",
    "the optimal cuts depend , of course , on the values of the vector and axial - vector couplings , but either @xmath52 or @xmath53 provide a reasonable statistical significance for almost all the combinations of the couplings .",
    "this is an important result , because it means that a relatively low cut  at about half of the mass of the resonance or even below ",
    "is enough to have a good statistical significance , and a clear signal from the measurement of the charge asymmetry .",
    "we now fix @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and we study how the central asymmetry and its statistical significance vary as a function of the vector and the axial - vector couplings , for a given value of the resonance mass",
    ". these choices , for which we have found the best statistical significances , are of course arbitrary and are not necessarily the best for all the values of the vector and axial - vector couplings . for illustrative",
    "purposes are , however , good representatives .",
    "we have chosen @xmath54 and @xmath55  tev .",
    "the results in the @xmath56 plane are presented in fig [ fig : lhc_kk_2d_14tev ] .",
    "it is possible to see that the pattern of the size of the asymmetry is quite similar independently of the value of the resonance mass ; it depends mostly on the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "a sizable asymmetry is found whatever the value of the resonance mass is .",
    "the statistical significance , as expected , decreases with higher resonance masses .",
    "we have analyzed at lhc the charge asymmetry of top - antitop quark pair production in qcd and through the exchange of a color - octet heavy boson with flavor independent coupling to quarks .",
    "this is an observable that is very sensitive to new physics .",
    "we have studied the statistical significance of the measurement of such an asymmetry , and we have found that it is possible to tune the selection cuts in order to find a sensible significance . the maximum of the statistical significance for the measurement of the asymmetry as predicted by qcd is obtained without introducing any cut in the invariant mass of the top - antitop quark pair , even if the asymmetry is smaller in this case .",
    "when a heavy resonance is considered , one or two maxima in the significance spectrum are found , depending on the size of the couplings .",
    "the position of the peaks depends on the ratio @xmath57 and not on the resonance mass .",
    "one of the peaks can be located at an energy scale as low as one half of the resonance mass , or even below .",
    "data samples of top and antitop quarks that are not too energetic can then be used to detect or exclude the existence of this kind of resonances .",
