    "stellar - mass black holes in accreting x - ray binary systems provide unique probes of the physical properties and formation mechanism of black holes , as well as the physics of accretion and associated outflow .",
    "however , our understanding of black hole systems is hampered by the fact that distances to x - ray binaries are relatively poorly known , typically uncertain by 50% or more @xcite .",
    "standard spectroscopic estimates are handicapped by the distortions induced in the secondary by its compact partner , contamination by emission from the accretion disc @xcite , and uncertainties in estimates of interstellar absorption .",
    "since these distance uncertainties are systematic rather than random , they can not be reduced by making more observations . according to @xcite",
    ", these systematic uncertainties can artificially enlarge the difference between the quiescent x - ray luminosities of black hole and neutron star systems .",
    "if true this would undermine the claimed evidence for an event horizon @xcite .",
    "accurate distances are also required to interpret the measured proper motions of black hole x - ray binaries , by converting a measured proper motion into a physical speed , from which we can derive the peculiar velocity of the source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can be used to place constraints on any velocity kick the black hole might have received in its natal supernova , and hence on the formation mechanism of the black hole @xcite .    the only direct , model - independent method of measuring distances is via trigonometric parallax , which has hitherto been impossible for black hole x - ray binary systems , since they lie at distances of several kpc , and hence require sub - milliarcsecond astrometry to measure their parallaxes .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at radio wavelengths is currently the only technique available for such high - precision astrometric measurements .",
    "however , black hole x - ray binaries spend the majority of their time in a faint quiescent state , where they are often not detected in the radio band at current sensitivities .",
    "they become bright enough to be detected during outbursts , but such outbursts are typically not sufficiently long or frequent and do not sample the earth s orbit well enough to make a parallax measurement feasible . during outbursts ,",
    "the radio emission is often resolved at the high angular resolutions required for precision astrometry , making it difficult to determine the true location of the binary system from epoch to epoch .",
    "lastly , many black hole x - ray binaries are located in or close to the galactic plane , such that the scatter - broadening along the line of sight makes high - precision astrometry impossible in the centimeter waveband where current vlbi arrays have the highest sensitivity .",
    "here we present high sensitivity array ( hsa ) observations of v404 cyg , the most luminous known black hole x - ray binary in quiescence . with a mass function of @xmath3 @xcite ,",
    "the compact object is a dynamically - confirmed black hole , accreting matter from a k0 subgiant companion star @xcite .",
    "the system has a quiescent radio flux density of 0.3mjy , with a flat spectrum indicative of a self - absorbed compact jet @xcite , although the jets are not resolved at the angular resolution of the hsa @xcite .",
    "the persistent , unresolved radio emission makes this source a good target for astrometric observations to measure its parallax .",
    "we observed v404 cyg every 3 months over the course of one year , using the hsa .",
    "two of the observations were made at the times of maximum parallactic displacement in right ascension ( r.a . ) , since the r.a.signal is larger , and , owing to the greater size of the array in the east - west dimension , has smaller error bars than that in declination .",
    "we observed at a frequency of 8.4ghz , in dual circular polarization , with an observing bandwidth of 64mhz per polarization .",
    "to these four hsa observations we added three archival datasets , two of which have already been reported @xcite , and one in which the source was previously not significantly detected @xcite , but knowing the astrometric parameters of the source , we were able to detect it at the @xmath4 level .",
    "a fourth archival epoch did not detect the source to a @xmath5 limit of 0.36mjybeam@xmath6 .",
    "a summary of the observations is listed in table [ tab : obs ] , and shows the extent of the source variability . in only one of the epochs was the source brighter than the @xmath5 upper limit of this archival dataset ( in which none of the large dishes of the hsa were available ) , making the non - detection consistent with the expected source flux density .    in all cases ,",
    "the observations were phase - referenced to a bright , nearby calibrator from the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) source list , j2025 + 3343 @xcite , located only 16.6@xmath7 from the target source .",
    "this implies that our systematic errors , which scale with distance from the phase reference source , should be relatively small ( @xmath8@xmath9as ; see below ) .",
    "we observed in 3-min cycles , spending 1min on the phase reference source and 2min on the target in each cycle . to maximize astrometric accuracy ,",
    "all data below @xmath10 elevation were discarded .",
    "we also discarded data taken during the short timescale flares seen in a number of the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , in case the assumed variations in the jet power responsible for the flaring events translated into positional offsets . to enable us to estimate the systematic errors affecting the astrometry",
    ", we substituted every seventh scan on the target source with an observation of a check source , the icrf calibrator j2023 + 3153 , located @xmath11 away from the phase reference source .",
    "data were reduced according to standard procedures within aips @xcite , and the source position at each epoch was determined by fitting an elliptical gaussian to the source . in no case did the source appear to be resolved . since the first epoch of archival data assumed a different position for the phase reference source , we corrected all epochs to a common calibrator position of @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( j2000 ) before fitting for the proper motion and parallax of v404 cyg .",
    "the measured positions are shown in figure  [ fig : sky_positions ] , together with the best - fit parallax and proper motion .",
    "@xcite used simulations to derive an approximate formula for the systematic errors affecting various vlbi arrays . for our calibrator - target separation and source declination , the estimated systematic errors ( for a mean value of the wet zenith path delay )",
    "are 26@xmath9as in r.a .  and 30@xmath9as in dec .",
    "the fitted positions of the check source show an rms scatter of 13@xmath9as in r.a .  and 31@xmath9as in dec .",
    "since the check source is seven times further away from the phase reference source than the target , this provides a rigorous upper limit on the systematic errors in position . as seen from table [ tab : obs ] , our astrometric accuracy is limited by signal - to - noise rather than systematic errors .",
    "nevertheless , the systematic errors estimated from @xcite were added to the statistical errors in quadrature before using the singular value decomposition ( svd ) method ( as detailed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to fit for a reference position and proper motion in r.a .  and",
    "dec . , and",
    "for the source parallax .",
    "the best - fitting astrometric parameters , taking the mid - point of the observations , mjd54322 , as the reference date , were : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18    the fitted parallax signal , with the best - fitting proper motion removed , is shown in figure  [ fig : par_signal ] .",
    "the reduced-@xmath19 value of the fit is 3.2 , which , with 9 degrees of freedom , implies a @xmath20%-confidence result .",
    "a bootstrap data - stripping analysis , as detailed by @xcite , confirmed the validity of these results , giving median values differing by less than @xmath21 from those found by the svd fit , albeit with slightly larger error bars owing to the data stripping .",
    "our fitted parallax corresponds to a source distance of @xmath1kpc .",
    "our fitted source distance is significantly closer than the best previous distance estimate of @xmath22kpc @xcite .",
    "however , that estimate was derived using an assumed interstellar extinction of @xmath23 , and did not take into account uncertainties in the extinction .",
    "@xcite fitted the full multiwavelength spectral energy distribution with a template spectrum for a k0 iv star and found a formal best fit reddening of @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , we find that increasing @xmath25 to close to 4.0 brings the estimate of @xcite down into agreement with our results .",
    "this highlights the importance of using accurate extinction values when estimating source distances .",
    "given the typical uncertainties in the extinction towards black hole soft x - ray transients @xcite , we conclude that this issue is likely to affect the majority of such systems , rendering their distance estimates also uncertain .",
    "our measured distance is significantly closer than the 3.54.0kpc commonly assumed for the source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reducing its luminosity by a factor of 2.22.8 .",
    "the quiescent 0.310kev unabsorbed flux of @xmath26erg@xmath27s@xmath6 , derived using a power - law model for the x - ray spectrum @xcite , implies a quiescent luminosity of @xmath28ergs@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite measured a maximum flux of 17crab with _ ginga _ during the 1989 outburst of v404 cyg , implying a 170kev luminosity of @xmath29ergs@xmath6 , which is of order @xmath30 for the black hole mass of @xmath31 derived for v404 cyg @xcite .",
    "thus the system was not super - eddington during the 1989 outburst .",
    "furthermore , in reducing the source radio and x - ray luminosities , our new distance will reduce the scatter in the radio / x - ray correlation @xcite , bringing the points measured for v404 cyg into better alignment with those of gx 339 - 4 .      with a more accurate distance and proper motion for the source , and the updated galactic rotation parameters ( @xmath32kpc , @xmath33kms@xmath6 ) given by @xcite ( but note",
    "* ) , we can revisit the analysis of @xcite to derive a more accurate peculiar velocity of @xmath34kms@xmath6 .",
    "this error bar now includes the uncertainties in both the distance and in all three space velocity components .",
    "this new value is significantly lower than the best - fitting peculiar velocity of 64kms@xmath6 derived for a 4kpc distance @xcite , and can easily be achieved via a blaauw kick , such that no asymmetric supernova kick is required .",
    "the component of the peculiar velocity in the galactic plane is 39.6kms@xmath6 , which , compared to the expected velocity dispersion in the galactic plane of 18.9kms@xmath6@xcite for the likely f0-f5 progenitor of the donor star , is a @xmath35 result , implying a probability of only 0.038 that the peculiar velocity is a result of galactic velocity dispersion ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore find it most probable that the peculiar velocity arises from a natal supernova kick , the magnitude of which is consistent with recoil due to mass loss ( a blaauw kick ) , with any additional asymmetric kick being small .",
    "@xcite placed an upper limit of 1.3mas on the source size , corresponding to a physical size of @xmath36au at our new distance .",
    "while we did not resolve the source , our highest - resolution data , taken with a global vlbi array at 22ghz , constrain the source size to @xmath37mas , a physical size of @xmath2au .",
    "we can therefore place a lower limit of @xmath38k on the brightness temperature of the source . from the high brightness temperature , the observed flat radio spectrum @xcite characteristic of a steady ,",
    "partially self - absorbed conical outflow @xcite , and the location of the source on the radio / x - ray correlation of @xcite , at the high - luminosity end of which jets have been directly resolved @xcite , we infer that the observed radio emission is likely to arise from compact , steady synchrotron - emitting jets .",
    "our upper limit on the jet size can be compared to that of the resolved jets in cygnus x-1 @xcite , with an angular size of 15mas at 8.4ghz .",
    "since the jet size scales inversely with observing frequency @xcite , this implies 5mas at 22ghz , for a physical scale of @xmath39au . since @xcite found the jet length should scale as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the jet luminosity , then the difference in radio luminosities of the two sources suggests a size scale of @xmath42au for v404 cyg at 22ghz .",
    "thus we are beginning to probe the angular scales on which the jets may be resolved .",
    "the scatter in the residuals after our parallax fit ( 0.10mas in r.a .  and 0.14mas in dec .",
    ") can also help constrain the size and stability of the jets , since any motion of unresolved emitting knots along the jet will change the brightness distribution and hence the measured centroid position .",
    "in particular , a comparison of source positions measured during flares with those from the adjacent non - flaring data from which the proper motion and parallax were derived will constrain the changes in jet morphology during flaring events . if the magnitude of the flares correlates with jet power and hence jet size",
    ", we might expect brighter flares to show the largest positional shifts . for our brightest flare ,",
    "in which the flux density increased by a factor of 3 , the @xmath5 upper limit to the shift in the centroid position is 0.3mas .",
    "this constrains the emitting region during the flare to be at an angular separation of @xmath43mas ( a physical separation of @xmath44au ) from the surface in the steady jet where the optical depth is unity . while such small positional shifts imply that minor flaring events should not destroy the parallax signal , if they can be better constrained during larger flares or with a higher - sensitivity array , such positional shifts could in future",
    "provide a method for determining the size scale of quiescent jets even in cases where they can not be directly resolved .",
    "these observations demonstrate that it is feasible to measure a parallax distance to a sufficiently bright quiescent black hole x - ray binary .",
    "we have shown that the radio jets inferred to exist in the quiescent state of x - ray binaries do not hinder the astrometry sufficiently to render a parallax measurement impossible .",
    "the advent of the evla and the ongoing vlba sensitivity upgrade will allow us to extend this method to a number of systems with fainter quiescent jets , as well as opening up the possibility of detecting gyrosynchrotron emission from low - mass donor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with accurate distances to a sample of quiescent black hole and neutron star systems",
    ", it will be possible to quantitatively assess the claim that black holes are less luminous than neutron star systems @xcite .",
    "accurate outburst luminosities for a sample of black holes will help quantify the factor by which such systems can exceed their eddington luminosities , with implications for the nature of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) in external galaxies .    with a sample of black hole proper motions and parallax distances , it will be possible to derive accurate peculiar velocities to probe the formation mechanisms of black holes of different masses .",
    "the three main channels are direct collapse ( giving no peculiar velocity ) , or via a supernova and fallback onto the proto - neutron star , with either a relatively small recoil kick for a symmetric supernova , or a potentially large kick from an asymmetric explosion . in the fallback case it is currently unclear whether and how the velocity scales with the amount of matter falling back on the neutron star . a sample of black hole peculiar velocities would provide much - needed observational constraints , and help to determine whether there is a mass cutoff between black holes forming via direct collapse and those which form via a supernova and fallback @xcite .",
    "finally , one of the methods currently employed to measure black hole spins , via fitting of the x - ray spectrum during the thermal - dominant state of the source during outburst @xcite requires accurate distances .",
    "better distance constraints will allow for improved comparisons with spins derived via fitting the general relativistic distortions in disk reflection lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , providing further insights into the generation and distribution of black hole spins .",
    "we have used hsa observations to measure the most accurate distance to a black hole to date , via the method of trigonometric parallax .",
    "the distance of v404 cyg is @xmath1kpc , significantly lower than the previous best estimate of the source distance , and demonstrating that uncertainties in the interstellar extinction can introduce significant errors into distance estimates . with the new distance",
    ", we can determine that v404 cyg did not exceed its eddington luminosity during the 1989 outburst , and that it is likely to have formed in a natal supernova , with the peculiar velocity being consistent with recoil from the ejected mass , and any asymmetric kick being small .",
    "we have further constrained the size of the quiescent jets in the source to @xmath2au .",
    "these observations demonstrate the feasibility of measuring parallax distances to black hole x - ray binaries using vlbi techniques , which could , with a larger sample of systems , firm up evidence for black hole event horizons , and provide new insights into black hole spins , the mechanism of black hole formation , and the nature of ulxs .",
