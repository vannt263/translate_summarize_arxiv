    "a competitive method to search for solar axions could be to look with an x - ray satellite at the sun when it is shadowed by the earth and search for x - rays from the axion - photon conversion in the earth s magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "a related idea is to look for high - energy @xmath58-rays , e.g.  with the glast satellite , that `` pass through the sun '' by magnetic conversion and back conversion  @xcite .",
    "cast can detect axions only if they actually escape from the sun .",

    "the axion mfp is then @xmath61 , or about @xmath62 of the radius of the visible universe .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 would have to be more than @xmath63 larger than the cast limit for axions to be re - absorbed in the sun . even in this extreme case",
    "they are not harmless because they would carry the bulk of the energy flux that otherwise is carried by photons .",
    "the mfp of low - mass particles that are trapped in the sun should be shorter than that of photons ( about 10  cm near the solar center ) to avoid a dramatic modification of the solar structure  @xcite .",
    "this requirement is so extreme that for anything similar to axions the possibility of re - absorption is not a serious possibility .",
    "the most restrictive astrophysical limit on @xmath18 arises from globular cluster stars .",
    "a globular cluster is a gravitationally bound system of stars that formed at the same time and thus differ primarily in their mass .",
    "a globular cluster provides a homogeneous population of stars , allowing for detailed tests of stellar - evolution theory .",
    "the stars surviving since formation have masses somewhat below @xmath64 . in a color - magnitude diagram , where one plots essentially the surface brightness vs.  the surface temperature , stars appear in characteristic loci , allowing one to identify their state of evolution .",
    "the stars on the horizontal branch ( hb ) have reached helium burning where their core ( about @xmath65 ) generates energy by fusing helium to carbon and oxygen with a core - averaged energy release of about @xmath66 . on the other hand ,",
    "the average primakoff energy loss is approximately @xmath67 .",
    "the main effect would be an acceleration of the consumption of helium and thus a reduction of the hb lifetime by a factor @xmath68 , i.e. , by about 30% for @xmath69 .",
    "number counts in 15  globular clusters  @xcite reveal typically 100 hb stars in the used fields of view .",
    "this is compared with the number of red giants ( evolutionary phase before helium ignition , but after core - exhaustion of hydrogen ) and shows that the hb lifetime in any one cluster is established within about 2040% .",
    "note that the primakoff losses are much smaller for red giants so that their lifetime is not reduced by primakoff emission .",
    "compounding the results of all 15 clusters , the helium - burning lifetime agrees with expectations to within about 10% @xcite .",
    "of course , with modern data these results likely could be improved .",
    "either way , a reasonably conservative limit is ( figs .  [",
    "fig : cast ] and  [ fig : exclusion ] ) @xmath70 it is comparable to the cast limit eq .",
    "( [ eq : castlimit ] ) , but applies for higher masses because the relevant temperature is about 10  kev so that significant threshold effects only begin at about @xmath71  kev . for qcd axions",
    "the coupling increases with mass so that the limit reaches to even larger masses .    in the helium - burning core , convection and semi - convection dredges helium fuel to the burning site near the core s center so that 2530% of all helium is burnt during the hb phase .",
    "therefore , while the standard theoretical predictions depend on a phenomenological treatment of convection , there is limited room for additional energy supply , even if the treatment of convection were grossly incorrect .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields are ubiquitous in astrophysics so that photon - axion conversions could be of interest . in practice",
    ", the energy - momentum mismatch typically prevents this effect from being important anywhere near the `` axion line . '' on the other hand , `` axion - like particles '' ( alps ) with smaller masses may well exist and could then have intriguing consequences .",
    "examples are the polarization of radio galaxies  @xcite and quasars  @xcite , the diffuse x - ray background  @xcite , or ultra - high energy cosmic rays if they have a photon component  @xcite .",
    "one interesting cosmological consequence is the dimming of distant sources by photon - alp conversion in intergalactic @xmath20 fields  @xcite , for a review see ref .",
    "the apparent dimming of distant sne  ia is usually attributed to accelerated cosmic expansion .",
    "all things considered , the required dimming can not be caused by photon - alp conversion , but this effect may still figure for a detailed interpretation of the cosmic equation of state implied by current and future sn  ia data .",
    "preventing excessive suppression of photon - alp conversion in this context requires @xmath72@xmath73  ev , i.e. , the alp mass should be smaller than the photon plasma frequency in the intergalactic medium .",
    "for such small masses , the absence of @xmath58-rays from sn  1987a implies @xmath74 , valid for @xmath75  ev @xcite .",
    "the alps would have been emitted in sn  1987a by the primakoff effect and converted in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "a similar argument applied to the nearby red giant betelgeuse yields a slightly less restrictive limit  @xcite , but of course depends on fewer assumptions .",
    "alp - photon conversion in stellar magnetic fields is also possible , notably in the magnetic fields of sun spots  @xcite or the strong magnetic fields of pulsars  @xcite , although at present no new limit or positive signature is available from these considerations .",
    "magnetic fields induce vacuum birefringence in that electromagnetic radiation with polarization parallel ( @xmath76 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath77 ) to @xmath20 has a different refractive index induced by a one - loop qed correction to maxwell s equations  @xcite",
    ". this vacuum cotton - mouton effect has never been measured , but can be searched in the laboratory by propagating a linearly polarized laser beam in a strong @xmath20 field and measure a small ellipticity that develops  @xcite .",
    "alps , axions , neutral pions , and other particles with a two - photon vertex also contribute to this effect in that the photon mixes with them in a transverse @xmath20 field  @xcite .",
    "if sufficiently light , these particles also cause vacuum dichroism , i.e. , the @xmath76 and @xmath77 polarization states are absorbed differently due to photon - alp conversion .",
    "the observable effect is a rotation of the plane of polarization .",
    "a huge effect of this sort has been reported by the pvlas collaboration  @xcite , where the amplitude of the observed dichroism is roughly @xmath78 times larger than the expected qed ellipticity amplitude .",
    "an instrumental origin has not been identified , but further tests and modifications of the experiment will be performed .    in pvlas ,",
    "the superconducting magnet is rotated to modulate the signal because a static dichroism or birefringence is overwhelmed by residual instrumental effects .",
    "it has been proposed that the @xmath20 field rotation mixes sidebands to the primary laser frequency with a separation corresponding to the rotation frequency  @xcite .",
    "while such effects would in principle occur , the quantitative treatment in this paper vastly overestimates the effect ; not even the use of electromagnetic units is correct .",
    "the slow magnet rotation does not cause a @xmath78 fold enhancement of the qed effect .",
    "still , the exciting possibility that an alp has been detected is damped by the extreme requirements on its properties  @xcite @xmath79 with this coupling strength , the sun s alp luminosity would exceed its photon emission by more than a factor of @xmath80 and thus could live only for 1000  years .",
    "a number of models have been proposed to circumvent this problem in that the alp properties and interactions could strongly depend on the environment in the sun or on energy  @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that to square the particle interpretation of pvlas with the astrophysical limits is a tall order .",
    "therefore , barring the identification of an instrumental effect that causes the pvlas signature , the best hope is to test this hypothesis directly , notably in a new generation of `` shining light through walls '' experiments  @xcite .",
    "besides their generic interaction with photons , axions also interact with fermions @xmath81 by a derivative interaction of the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a model - dependent numerical factor and @xmath84 the fermion mass .",
    "the pseudoscalar form is equivalent when only a single axion is attached to the fermion line in a given feynman graph .",
    "subtleties for axion - nucleon interactions in a nuclear medium arise because of the axion - pion mixing  @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar form suggests to quantify the interaction in terms of a dimensionless yukawa coupling @xmath85 and associated `` fine structure constant '' @xmath86 .    in stellar plasmas ,",

    ", axion emission can affect the cooling speed and thus the period decrease of zz ceti stars ( pulsating white dwarfs ) , although a previously measured anomalous period decrease of the star g117-b15a has disappeared in the light of more recent analyses  @xcite .",
    "the axion - electron interaction provides extremely restrictive limits , but in hadronic axion models this coupling does not exist at tree level .",
    "axions are a qcd phenomenon , so their interactions with pions , nucleons and photons are far more generic than those with electrons .",
    "unfortunately , the astrophysical arguments leading to the electron coupling can not be trivially recycled because axions couple to the nucleon spin and thus at low energies do not interact with @xmath96 particles .",
    "therefore , processes of the sort @xmath97 do not occur , although they provide limits on the scalar or vector coupling of new bosons  @xcite .    however , the sun largely consists of hydrogen so that axions are produced by the compton - like process @xmath98 .",
    "the cross section is @xmath99 with @xmath84 the fermion mass , i.e. , the energy loss rate caused by protons relative to electrons is suppressed by a factor @xmath100 . taking the proton density in the sun to be 1/2 that of electrons , using @xmath101 for the solar axion luminosity from the electron compton process , and observing that helioseismology allows at most a 20% exotic energy loss , we find @xmath102 for the axion - proton interaction .",
    "much more restrictive limits arise from the observed neutrino burst of supernova ( sn ) 1987a  @xcite .",
    "the burst lasted for about 10  s , in agreement with the usual picture of neutrino trapping and slow diffusive energy loss of the collapsed sn core .",
    "excessive axion losses would have shortened the burst duration . on the other hand ,",
    "if axions interact so strongly that their mfp is similar to that of neutrinos , they will not much affect the neutrino signal .",
    "the results from different numerical simulations and treatments agree reasonably well  @xcite and lead to the `` consolidated '' exclusion range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion ] .",
    "early papers found more restrictive limits , but they overestimated the emission rate .",
    "the main process is nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung .",
    "axions couple to the nucleon spin so that only spin - nonconserving interactions contribute , i.e. , the nuclear tensor force .",
    "if it is modeled by one - pion exchange , the interaction rate is so large that axions emitted from different collisions would destructively interfere , leading to a suppression of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal type  @xcite .",
    "later it was noted that one - pion exchange may be a poor model for the relevant conditions and the bremsstrahlung rate was calculated on the basis of measured nuclear phase shifts , leading to a much smaller emission rate  @xcite .",
    "however , this result applies only in the low - energy limit .",
    "either way , the `` naive '' bremsstrahlung rate used in early studies is reduced .",
    "since the sn  1987a limits suffer from these and other nuclear - physics uncertainties , but also from the sparse experimental data , it is not easily possible to quantify an objective error estimate .",
    "if axions interact so strongly that they are trapped more efficiently than neutrinos , still a significant flux will be emitted .",
    "it interacts with oxygen in the water cherenkov detectors that have recorded the sn  1987a signal and could have mimicked some of the signal  @xcite .",
    "this argument excludes another range of axion parameters ( fig .",

    "axions are produced in the hot thermal plasma of the early universe and , since they have a mass , contribute to the cosmic dark matter . before the qcd confinement transition at @xmath103 ,",
    "the relevant processes involve quarks and gluons , e.g. , the gluonic primakoff effect caused by the axions s generic two - gluon vertex  @xcite .",

    "this `` tilting of the mexican hat '' causes the axion field to roll toward the cp - conserving minimum , but this motion does not stop there . rather , coherent oscillations of the axion field are excited that ultimately represent a condensate of cold dark matter .",
