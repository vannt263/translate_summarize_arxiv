    "we consider the anisotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a bipartite lattice @xmath0 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & j \\sum_{<ij>}[s^z_is^z_j + \\frac{x}{2}(s^+_is^-_j+s^-_is^+_j ) ] \\nonumber \\\\   & \\equiv & h_0 + xv \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with s=1/2 spins interacting with their nearest neighbours .    in the ising limit @xmath1 ,",
    "the system is n \" eel ordered , with spins up ( @xmath2 ) on the a sublattice , let us say , and down ( @xmath3 ) on the b sublattice .",
    "the 1-particle ` magnon ' excitations correspond to a single flipped spin on either the a sublattice , with total spin @xmath4 , or on the b sublattice ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "they have an excitation energy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lattice coordination number",
    ".    separated two - particle excitations then have energy @xmath8 in this limit ; but a two - particle excitation on neighbouring a and b sites has energy only @xmath9 , with total spin @xmath10 , forming a 2-particle bound state .",
    "when one takes the isotropic limit @xmath11 , as is well known , the energy gap for the single magnon states vanishes .",
    "the question then is , do the 2-particle bound states survive in this limit ?",
    "it is well - known that two - magnon bound states exist for the isotropic heisebnberg _",
    "ferromagnet _ - see for example the textbook discussion by mattis @xcite .",
    "in recent years , there have also been considerable discussions of bound states in antiferromagnetic systems with frustration or anisotropy @xcite . the question still remains , however , whether there might also be bound states in the simple , isotropic antiferromagnet .",
    "according to mattis , this remained an `` unanswered question '' in 1965 ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 166 ) .",
    "the question was investigated using spin - wave theory by oguchi and ishikawa @xcite in 1973 .",
    "they used linear spin - wave theory with some fourth - order interaction terms included .",
    "they found that the two - magnon bound states merge into the continuum as one goes from the ising limit to the isotropic limit , so that none survive .",
    "this calculation neglects many higher - order effects which might be important , however , so it can not be taken as definitive .",
    "some numerical calculations involving multi - magnon states have also been carried out for the isotropic antiferromagnet on the square lattice .",
    "these include a studies of the spectral weights using series expansions @xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , and a continuous unitary transformation ( cuts ) study of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "none of these works , however , have addressed the question of the bound states .    in this paper",
    "we explore the fate of the two - magnon bound states for two particular cases , the one - dimensional chain and the two - dimensional square lattice . in one dimension , the model is exactly solvable , and the answer is already known : we simply review the results . in two dimensions ,",
    "we use linked cluster methods @xcite to obtain series expansions in @xmath12 up to order o(@xmath13 ) for the bound - state energies , and extrapolate the results to @xmath14 using standard methods . in summary ,",
    "our results agree quite well with the spin - wave predictions @xcite .",
    "the bound states disappear into the 2-particle continuum shortly before the isotropic limit @xmath11 is reached .",
    "the one - dimensional model , i.e. the linear chain , is a special case .",
    "the model can be solved exactly using the bethe ansatz @xcite , and exact expressions for the low - lying spectrum have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the independent quasiparticles in this case are not @xmath15 magnons , but @xmath16 ` spinons ' , or domain walls . in the ising limit @xmath17 ,",
    "for instance , the ground state consists of alternating spins @xmath16 on even or odd sites respectively , or the reverse ( fig.[fig1]a ) .",
    "a spinon or domain wall consists of a neighbouring pair of identical spins in an otherwise alternating chain ( fig.[fig1]b ) . for periodic or anti - periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "spinons can only be created in pairs .",
    "thus on an even lattice with periodic boundary conditions , say , the lowest - lying excitations above the ground state consist of a pair of spinons , which may be one lattice spacing apart ( fig.[fig1]c ) , two spacings apart ( fig.[fig1]d ) , or any number apart . fig .",
    "[ fig1]c then corresponds to a single spin - flip , and fig .",
    "[ fig1]d to two neighbouring spin - flips , and so on . the excitation energy in this limit , however , is @xmath18 , independent of the spacing .",
    "johnson , krinsky and mccoy @xcite have obtained an exact expression for the low - lying excitation energy at all @xmath12 : @xmath19 \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind whose nome is @xmath22 and modulus @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are two free parameters corresponding to the momenta of the two domain walls in each sector .",
    "this spectrum is the same in the @xmath25 and the ( doubly degenerate ) @xmath26 sectors , so that the two @xmath27 spinons combine to form a degenerate @xmath28 triplet and @xmath29 singlet , at all couplings @xmath12 in the range .",
    "so in this case , the state with two neighbouring flipped spins merely forms part of the 2-spinon continuum .",
    "as the prime example of a bipartite system in two dimensions , we consider the model on a square lattice . in this case no exact solution is known , and so we have calculated numerical estimates for the energy of the 2-magnon state using series methods @xcite .",
    "we perform an ising expansion , taking the ising hamiltonian @xmath30 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) as our unperturbed starting point , when the bound state consists simply of a pair of flipped spins on neighbouring sites , as discussed above .",
    "a perturbation series expansion in @xmath12 is then calculated for the bound state energy , with @xmath31 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) as the perturbation operator . as a technical point",
    ", we note that the bound state lies in the same sector as the ground state , and hence a ` multiblock ' diagonalization algorithm @xcite must be employed .",
    "note also that there is one bound state configuration for each lattice bond , making a total of four times as many configurations as for either of the single - magnon states .",
    "correspondingly , we obtain results for four different paths @xmath32 in the brillouin zone , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , whereas only the @xmath33 mode is independent for the single - magnon state .     corresponding to the four two - magnon bound states . ]",
    "the calculations have been carried out through o(@xmath13 ) . since only even - order terms appear , this corresponds to only five series coefficients at any fixed momentum .",
    "the leading order terms in the dispersion relation for the bound state excitation energy are :    @xmath34 \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the complete series coefficients at selected momenta are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "estimates of the bound - state energy as a function of @xmath12 were now obtained using pad ' e approximants to extrapolate the series . since the number of coefficients is small , the accuracy of the extrapolation is also low . at smaller values of @xmath12 ,",
    "nevertheless , quite good estimates are possible .",
    "for example , figure [ fig3 ] shows dispersion relations for the four bound - stste modes at @xmath35 , as compared with the lower bound of the 2-particle continuum .",
    "it can be seen that all four modes remain bound below the intermediate plateau of the continuum , and only near @xmath36 do three out of the four modes merge into the continuum .",
    "the first mode appears to remain bound at all momenta .          at @xmath37",
    "it is a different story , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] . in short",
    ", it appears that none of the four modes remain bound at any momentum .",
    "the nominal error bars are much larger in this case , firstly because @xmath12 is larger , but also because we may expect some sort of singular behaviour where the bound state merges with the continuum .",
    "the clearest picture is obtained for the first mode , where near @xmath38 the estimates lie on the lower edge of the continuum , within errors .",
    "there is an apparent levelling off at very small momenta , but this is a common feature of pad ' e extrapolations in heisenberg - type models ; if a huse transform @xcite was performed before the extrapolation , something much closer to the continuum behaviour would be expected . at larger momenta",
    ", the estimates generally lie well above the continuum lower bound .",
    "these results may be compared with the spin - wave results of oguchi and ishikawa @xcite , who calculated the bound - state energies as functions of @xmath12 for two specific momenta . at @xmath39",
    ", they found that the bound states merged with the continuum in the range @xmath40 ; we find only one bound state remaining at @xmath41 , in agreement with their results . at @xmath42 , they found the merger to occur at somewhat larger values @xmath43 ; we find that all four states remain bound at @xmath35 , but have vanished by @xmath37 , once more in agreement with their results .",
    "of course , the actual values for the energies have changed as higher - order terms are added in , but not by a large amount .",
    "we have used series expansion methods to calculate the energy of two - magnon bound states in the anisotropic heisenberg - ising antiferromagnet on the square lattice .",
    "we find that the bound states do not survive in the isotropic limit , in agreement with the spin - wave predictions of oguchi and ishikawa @xcite .",
    "there are no bound states in the linear chain model either .",
    "hence one may extrapolate that there will be no bound states in the isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet on any bipartite lattice , in sharp distinction to the ferromagnetic case .",
    "oguchi and ishikawa @xcite have given some qualitative arguments why this might be so .",
