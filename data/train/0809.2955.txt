    "the standard model ( sm ) makes precise predictions for the couplings between gauge bosons thanks to the non - abelian nature of its @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "these self - interactions are described by the trilinear @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 gouge couplings ( tgcs ) , which can be directly tested in the pair productions of the gauge bosons .",
    "therefore datasets of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 candidate events produced in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath141.96  tev at the tevatron @xmath6 collider provide crucial testing ground for sm .",
    "any deviations from the sm predictions can indicate presence of new physics .",
    "furthermore , diboson processes have signatures similar to that of the higgs production at the tevatron , and constitute background to the higgs searches .",
    "thus detailed understanding of the diboson processes at the tevatron is viewed as a first step towards probing the higgs boson production .",
    "production cross sections for the diboson processes at the tevatron are a few orders of magnitude smaller compared to that of the inclusive @xmath15 and @xmath16 productions .",
    "diboson events with the leptonic decays of @xmath15 and @xmath16 bosons provide final states with the lowest background contamination , but also suffer from small branching ratios .",
    "the tevatron collider has already delivered more than 4  fb@xmath5 of data to the cdf and d  experiments .",
    "these large datasets allow to probe the diboson processes even with very small production cross section times branching fraction , of the order of a few femtobarns .",
    "the results presented here are based on 0.2  2  fb@xmath17 of data .",
    "pair production of the @xmath15 bosons at the tevatron , @xmath19 , proceeds through @xmath20 exchange .",
    "thus @xmath0 events allow to probe trilinear @xmath21 couplings .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 events are dominant irreducible background to the higgs searches in the @xmath23 channel , and their understanding is important . when followed by leptonic decays , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) , of both @xmath15s , @xmath0 production leads to final states with two high-@xmath27 isolated leptons of opposite sign , @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 , and large transverse missing energy , @xmath31 , due to escaping neutrinos .",
    "there are many other sm processes which can give the similar event signature : @xmath32+jets production with a jet faking electron or containing muon , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 processes can all contribute to the background .",
    "signal separation from the background is achieved by rejecting @xmath35 and @xmath36 events with dilepton mass consistent to @xmath37 , by vetoing large hadronic activities , and removing events where missing @xmath38 is likely to have originated from jet mis - measurements .",
    "the @xmath0 production signal has been established by both , d  and cdf collaborations with already @xmath39240  pb@xmath5  @xcite and @xmath39  200  pb@xmath5  @xcite of data , respectively .",
