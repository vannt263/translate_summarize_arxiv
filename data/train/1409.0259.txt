    "several intermediate - age ( 1 - 3 gyr ) globular clusters ( gcs ) in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) exhibit an extended main sequence turnoff ( msto ) in their optical color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "the observed spread can appear either as a broad region or as a clear bifurcation , while the ms and red giant branch ( rgb ) appear well defined and narrow in the optical cmds . by using hubble space telescope ( hst ) photometry @xcite first detected two distinct mstos in the massive ,",
    "intermediate - age lmc gc ngc  1846 and in the last few years the list of gcs with anomalous msto morphologies has grown significantly ( see e.g. the sample of 16 lmc gcs discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "according to the observed msto morphology , three classes of intermediate - age magellanic clusters can be distinguished : ( 1 )  gcs with a narrow msto , with the massive gc ngc  1978 as prototype @xcite ; ( 2 )  gcs with a broad msto but no clear bimodality ; ( 3 )  gcs with a bimodal msto . out of 16 gcs studied by @xcite , five belong to class ( 1 ) and eight to class ( 2 ) .",
    "examples of clusters with bimodal msto are ngc  1751 , ngc  1806 , ngc  1846 in the lmc @xcite and ngc  419 in the smc @xcite .    in gcs",
    "where distinct sequences are observed , population ratios and radial distributions have been studied with results that are still debated and controversial . for example , @xcite found that the brightest msto stars in ngc  1846 are more centrally concentrated than the faintest ones . instead ,",
    "in ngc  1783 the faintest msto stars are more centrally concentrated @xcite .",
    "finally , at least in the cases of ngc  1806 , ngc  1846 and ngc  1751 , the brightest msto appears to be more populated with respect to the faintest one @xcite .",
    "spurious effects due to differential reddening , field star contamination or photometric uncertainties have been deeply investigated and ruled out ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and different scenarios to explain the observed msto have been envisaged .",
    "in particular it has been proposed that the extended mstos could reflect a real age difference , thus suggesting that these clusters have undergone prolonged ( continuous or bursty ) star formation activity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "within this framework , the ages should range between @xmath350 and @xmath3300 myr @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that an extended mstos are due to the presence of fast rotating ms stars , which are predicted to evolve at lower effective temperatures ( thus redder colors ) with respect to non - rotating ms stars .",
    "however , conflicting results about the efficiency of this effect have been found so far ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , through merging and mass transfer processes , interactive binaries can also produce an extension of the msto toward bluer colors and brighter magnitudes @xcite .",
    "however , this could only partially explain the broad mstos ( under the strong assumption that all the cluster stars are members of binary systems ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this scenario is unable to account for the bimodal msto .    in the first case",
    ", @xcite and @xcite proposed a connection between the double / broad msto and the self - enrichment processes invoked to explain the chemical anomalies in the light elements abundances commonly observed in old , massive gcs ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in the generally accepted scenario",

    "second generation _ stars formed from a gas processed by the cno cycle and ejected by first generation stars , like asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and/or fast - rotating massive stars . following this scenario ,",
    "the dual / broad mstos would be direct evidence of prolonged star formation activity occurring in the early stages of gc formation ( which is not observable in the cmds of old gcs because the age spread is negligible with respect to the cluster age ) . as a consequence , magellanic gcs with",

    "in order to investigate possible chemical anomalies in the abundances of light elements of ngc  1806 , we analyzed high - resolution spectra to derive o , na , mg and al abundances , and high - resolution photometric data to study c and n abundances .     _ the spectroscopic data set : _ high resolution spectra have been obtained with the multi - object facility flames @xcite at the very large telescope of the european southern observatory in the uves+giraffe combined mode .",

    "no evidence of star - to - star variations in terms of iron and light elements has been found .",
    "the average iron abundance turns out to be [ fe / h]=0.60@xmath14 dex ( @xmath15=  0.02 dex ) .",
    "the same level of homogeneity has been obtained for the light elements ( o , na , al , mg ) , which exhibit intrinsic spreads in all old , massive gcs , both in our galaxy @xcite and in the lmc @xcite .",
    "we carefully checked for the presence of intrinsic scatter by using the maximum likelihood algorithm described in @xcite , which calculates the mean and the intrinsic spread ( @xmath16 , with their corresponding uncertainties ) of a given abundance ratio by taking into account the uncertainties of each individual star .",
    "for all the measured abundance ratios , the target stars formally have @xmath16=  0.0 , pointing out a strict homogeneity in the chemical content of ngc  1806",
    ". the lack of any significant light element spread can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ nao ] , where the individual stars of ngc  1806 ( dark gray squares ) are compared to the stars observed in old galactic and lmc gcs ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) in the [ o / fe][na / fe ] plane .",

    "[ fld ] shows the average abundance ratios measured for the 8 cluster members and the abundance ratios for the surrounding lmc field stars , both for three elements ( o , na , mg ) involved in the well known chemical anomalies and for [ @xmath17si , ca , ti@xmath18/fe ] which usually shows no star - to - star variations . oxygen and magnesium abundances nicely agree with those measured for other @xmath19-elements ( si , ca , ti ) , at variance with what was found in old gcs where the stars with light element anomalies show [ o / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios systematically lower than the other @xmath19-elements . in addition , the abundance ratios measured in ngc  1806 well resemble those derived in the surrounding field stars ( which show solar - scaled abundances , on average )",
    ". generally , in an old gc showing light - elements spread , stars with chemistry similar to that of the field are considered to be first generation stars , while those with significant light element differences are labeled as second generation stars . in the case of ngc  1806 , the good agreement between cluster and field stars suggests that all the observed cluster members formed in the first episode of star formation .",
    "3 .   at odds with what is typically found in old gcs",
    "properly observed in the u band ( or similar filters , see e.g. the cases of m4 by @xcite and ngc  6362 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ( @xmath1 ; @xmath2 ) cmd of ngc  1806 does not exhibit any appreciable broadening or splitting of the rgb ( see fig .  [ cmd ] ) . in this plane",
    "possible rgb splittings are essentially driven by the intrinsic variations of c and n abundances , because the spectral region covered by the f336w filter ( centered around @xmath33360 @xmath20 ) is dominated by strong cn and nh molecular bands @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the ( @xmath2 ) color residuals calculated with respect to the rgb mean ridge line ( see the inset in fig .  [ cmd ] ) is fully compatible with the photometric uncertainties .",
    "this result suggests that no variations in the c and n abundances occur in the stellar population of ngc  1806 .",
    "although the size of the presented spectroscopic sample is admittedly small , we note that chemical anomalies as large as those observed in the galactic gcs have been detected in old lmc gcs ( namely ngc  1786 , ngc  2210 and ngc  2257 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the basis of samples of similar size . on the other hand , in old gcs the second generation stars numerically dominate the cluster population ( accounting for @xmath350%70% of the entire stellar content ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if two distinct stellar populations were present in ngc  1806 , we would have expected to observe @xmath346 stars with significant light element abundance differences . also , the remarkable chemical similarity between the cluster and the surrounding field stars rules out the possibility that all the observed stars are second generation stars .",
    "the presence of bimodal or extended mstos observed in some magellanic intermediate - age clusters and the chemical anomalies in light element abundances observed in old stellar clusters have been suggested to have the same origin @xcite : they could be the fingerprint of self - enrichment processes operated by intermediate - mass agbs and/or fast - rotating massive stars over a short timescale at the epoch of the cluster formation .",
    "hence , stars in clusters with extended mstos should exhibit significant light element abundance variations .",
    "the analysis of the chemical and photometric properties of the bimodal msto cluster ngc  1806 presented in this letter instead , indicates a high level of chemical homogeneity in the cluster population , drawing a simple conclusion : _ ngc  1806 does not show major evidence of multiple stellar populations as observed in old gcs _",
    "( included the old lmc gcs that exhibit chemical anomalies like those of the galactic ones , * ? ? ? * ) . also , we recall that ngc  1806 has a present - day mass ( m=1.07@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) comparable with those of the galactic / lmc old clusters where the chemical anomalies have been observed .",
    "hence , there is no evidence that ngc  1806 underwent any self - enrichment process .",
    "this suggests univocally that bimodal msto and light element chemical anomalies can not be explained within the same framework .",
    "moreover , a significant broadening of the msto has been observed only in a relatively small range of cluster ages , between 1 and 2 gyr ( see figure  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while it is not visible in younger clusters at odds with what would be expected if it was a common feature of the cluster formation process .",
    "indeed , for example , the young , massive lmc cluster ngc  1866 has been found to harbor a mono - age @xcite and mono - metallic @xcite stellar population .    in light of this finding ,",
    "other solutions ( invoking or not an intrinsic age spread but always preserving the homogeneity in the chemical abundances ) should be envisaged to explain this class of globulars ( see e.g. the extended discussions provided by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and @xcite ) .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , new episodes of star formation could be triggered by the merging or the interaction between an already existing cluster ( corresponding to the faintest msto ) and a giant molecular cloud .",
    "while no explicit predictions are provided for the chemical content of a gc formed through this mechanism , the authors do not exclude that the pollution by agb stars could occur and that the stars formed from the second burst of star formation could display the same kind of chemical anomalies in light elements observed in old gcs",
    ". however , this could be in disagreement with our findings in ngc  1806 .",
    "another possibility is that bimodal msto gcs are the result of a merging event between the components of a binary / multiple cluster system , formed by the collapse of the same molecular cloud but with an initial difference in their ages .",
    "this would naturally account for chemical homogeneity in clusters with different ages .",
    "the lmc and smc harbor a significant population of candidate binary / multiple clusters ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this scenario could explain only the bimodal mstos , but can not account for clusters with an extended msto without discrete sub - structures .",
    "other mechanisms , not requiring an age spread , could be the solution and they should be better investigated .",
    "@xcite first proposed that the effect of rotation in the evolution of ms stars with m@xmath181.2@xmath10 can account for the observed msto : for a coeval population , fast rotating ms stars evolve to lower @xmath7 , with respect to non - rotating stars , thus mimicking a redder msto . however , by including the effect of the rotation in the calculation of the stellar lifetimes ( an effect neglected by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xcite conclude that rotating stars are slightly bluer and brighter than non - rotating ones , but this effect is not sufficient to mimic extended mstos like those observed in the magellanic gcs . on the other hand , the recent investigation by @xcite leads to the opposite result .",
    "their calculations show that rotating stars are colder and evolve faster than non - rotating stars .",
    "in particular , @xcite emphasize that the efficiency of rotational induced mixing ( a mechanism that is still debated ) is a crucial parameter to reproduce the observed msto .",
    "thus , they conclude that rotation can , in principle , lead to a dual or broad msto . further investigations of this process and any alternative scenarios are needed and urged to finally understand the origin of the observed msto morphologies .",
