    "among relativistic concepts of direct application to gravitational lensing , the observer s past lightcone is perhaps the most fundamental .",
    "the lightcone concept unifies the temporal and spatial properties of lensing events in a geometrical manner that makes the multiplicity , magnification , and time delay of the images arise naturally . in this view ,",
    "gravitational lensing by dark and luminous matter causes the observer s past lightcone to curve into a singular three - dimensional hypersurface that self - intersects and folds sharply .",
    "it is the singular `` folding '' of the lightcone that is responsible for most features of interest in gravitational lensing , such as image multiplicity , magnification , and time delay .",
    "additionally , in this view , caustics  so relevant to observational lensing  literally acquire a new dimension , turning into caustic sheets ( possibly multiple ) contained within the lightcone itself , and carrying a sense of time as well as spatial location .",
    "the lightcone concept is most naturally built by imagining an optical wavefront emanating from an observer and traveling out and towards the past or future . at the start , the wavefront is convex and almost perfectly spherical . upon encountering gravitational lenses ,",
    "the wavefront becomes non - uniformly retarded , acquiring dents .",
    "no matter how small and insignificant these dents in the wavefront are soon after leaving the neighborhood of the lens , in time the normal propagation enhances them , inevitably developing crossings and sharp ridges .",
    "the surface traced out in spacetime by a wavefront is a ( past or future ) lightcone .",
    "the trace of the wavefront s sharp ridges and `` swallowtail '' points is called a `` comoving caustic surface '' if thought of as embedded in three - space , and a `` caustic surface '' if viewed in spacetime . in other words , a caustic surface is built out of caustic sheets with cusp ridges and higher - order singularities ( e.g. , swallowtails , elliptic umbilics , and hyperbolic umbilics ) .",
    "remarkably , in spite of the naturalness of this concept , very little attention has been paid to the greater significance of the caustics as sheets or surfaces . as a result , to our knowledge ,",
    "the properties of optical wavefronts and caustic surfaces in gravitational lensing have not progressed much beyond the generic local classification of caustic singularities of the general theory as developed by thom , arnold , and others .",
    "our goal is to initiate a program that investigates optical wavefronts and caustics as they relate to the matter distribution of the gravitational lenses in the spacetime .",
    "the vast majority of gravitational lenses can be modeled extremely well using a small - angle approximation of weak - field perturbations of a friedmann - lematre universe , and projecting the deflectors into planes ( thin - screen approximation )  see the monographs by schneider , ehlers , and falco @xcite and petters , levine , and wambsganss @xcite for a detailed treatment .",
    "an enormous advantage of weak - field , thin - screen gravitational lensing is that we can obtain explicit analytical expressions for the associated lightcones , optical wavefronts , and caustics on both the wavefronts and lightcones . indeed ,",
    "one of the reasons there has been limited progress in the study of quantitative properties of the optical caustic surfaces and wavefronts due to gravitating matter is the lack of computable physical models with observational relevance .",
    "thin - screen , weak - field gravitational lensing provides us with such a setting .    gravitational lensing from a wavefront perspective was used by refsdal @xcite to relate the hubble constant to the time delay between lensed images ( see @xcite , kayser and refsdal @xcite for more ) .",
    "arnold s singularity theory was used by petters @xcite to treat the local qualitative properties of caustic surfaces ( big caustics ) in gravitational lensing .",
    "friedrich and stewart @xcite , stewart @xcite , hasse , kriele and perlick @xcite , low @xcite , and ehlers and newman @xcite also used arnold s theory to treat wavefronts and caustics in general relativity with varied motivations .",
    "in the case of a strong gravitational field , rauch and blandford @xcite numerically computed the caustic sheets due to the kerr metric .",
    "wavefronts in the context of liquid droplet lenses have been studied extensively by berry , hannay , nye , upstill , and others  see berry and upstill @xcite , nye @xcite , and references therein .",
    "readers may also benefit from the popular article by nityananda @xcite on wavefronts in gravitational lensing .",
    "our paper calculates explicitly the equations governing the wavefronts and caustic surfaces in gravitational lensing with the standard approximations , and analytically relates the wavefronts and caustic surfaces to the gravitational potential of the lens .",
    "this allows us to give a first quantitative treatment of _ caustic surfing , _ a futuristic notion suggested by blandford @xcite in his millennium essay .",
    "the motivation for caustic surfing is to lock a satellite on a gravitationally lensed moving source so as to observe the source at a high magnification over an extended time period .",
    "we derive the starting equations for the trajectory to be followed in order to surf the caustic surface .",
    "the appeal of caustic surfing lies in its potential as a tool to obtain information about a distant moving source that could not otherwise be resolved .",
    "our article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii derives an explicit expression for the present optical path length in units of time of light signals that reach the observer in the thin - screen approximation . in section iii",
    ", this expression is used to define a new lensing map in which the sources lie on an instantaneous wavefront , rather than on a lens plane .",
    "the caustic surfaces and sheets are related to the wavefront lensing map in section iv .",
    "section v develops some fundamentals of the concept of caustic surfing .",
    "applications to the case of nonsingular and singular elliptical potential models , as well of singular isothermal spheres , are given in section vi .",
    "the latter section also gives full classifications of the singularities of the wavefronts and caustic surfaces of the noted lenses , and explicitly illustrates the caustic surfing concept .",
    "we conclude in section vii with some remarks and an outlook of future applications .",
    "the research reported in this paper extends preliminary results on wavefronts in gravitational lensing first reported by frittelli and petters @xcite at the ninth marcel grossmann meeting .",
    "we shall calculate the present optical length of gravitationally lensed light rays from a source to the observer using fermat s principle and coordinates in space .",
    "this will include a formula ( lensing map ) relating the position of a lensed source to the impact positions at the gravitational lens of lensed light rays from the source to observer .",
    "for the convenience of readers who are new to gravitational lensing , sections ii.a and ii.b.1 give an introduction overviewing those aspects of lensing relevant to our wavefront and caustic surface considerations .",
    "readers already familiar with the basics of gravitational lensing can skip to section ii.b.2 , where we cast the lens equation in comoving form .",
    "we use the usual cosmological setting of gravitational lensing , namely , a weak - field perturbation of a friedmann - lematre spacetime .",
    "these models are quite robust and fit extremely well with observations .",
    "a detailed treatment of the assumptions and approximations used to model most gravitational lensing scenarios is given in chapter 3 of @xcite .",
    "the spacetime geometry in the vicinity of a weak - field gravitational lens system ( i.e. , source , lens(es ) , observer , and light rays between source and observer ) is approximated by the following spacetime metric :    [ eq - glmetric ] _",

    "also @xmath4 represents the time - independent newtonian potential of the density perturbation due to the lens(es ) , and @xmath5 the metric of space with constant curvature @xmath6 .",
    "the weak - field limit is assumed ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , so we ignore terms of order greater than @xmath8 .",
    "note that the potential @xmath4 obeys the cosmological poisson equation  see section  [ subsub - t - le ] .",
    "the weak - field assumption near a gravitational lens ensures that the bending angles @xmath9 of light rays deflected by the lens are small , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the latter assumption , we suppose that the lens is `` thin . ''",
    "this means that along the line of sight , the diameter of the matter distribution of the lens or source is very small compared to the distances between lens and observer , and between lens and source .",
    "we shall treat the gravitational lens and the point sources as lying on planes  called the _ lens plane _ and _ light source plane _  approximately orthogonal to an axis defined by the observer and some central point on the lens  referred to as the optical axis .",
    "all these assumptions allow us to consistently restrict lensing to small observation angles as measured from the optical axis .",
    "now consider the gravitational lensing metric @xmath11 in ( [ eq - glmetric ] ) .",
    "there are coordinates @xmath12 in space , called _ comoving coordinates _",
    ", such that the riemannian metric @xmath13 becomes    [ eq - ccmetric ] ds^2_= + r^2 ( d^2 + ^2d^2 ) .",
    "we assume that the comoving coordinates are dimensionless , the expansion factor @xmath2 has physical dimensions of length , and the potential @xmath4 has physical dimensions of @xmath14}^2/\\mbox{\\rm [ time]}^2 $ ] .",
    "the cosmic time @xmath0 has dimension of time , while the conformal time @xmath1 is dimensionless . away from the neighborhood of the lens ,",

    ", the newtonian potential of an isolated body decays no faster than @xmath16 .",
    "some plausible ways to justify the use of this metric as intended are discussed in @xcite and references therein .",
    "still , it is not at all clear how to improve on this assumption rigorously . indeed , there are some unresolved technical mathematical issues with the standard approximations in gravitational lensing , but it is not our intention to address them here .    in this work",
    "we will restrict our discussion to a flat cosmological setting .",
    "_ henceforth , we shall assume that the gravitational lensing metric @xmath17 has @xmath18 .",

    "assuming that the telescope lies somewhere on a caustic sheet of the source away from singularities ( e.g. , cusp ridges , swallowtails , elliptic umbilics , hyperbolic umbilics ) , what should the subsequent motion of the telescope be in order to track the image of the source at a peak brightness ?",

    ", we shall minimize @xmath293 for a fixed spatial position and time subjected to the constraint in ( [ eq - constraint ] ) .",
    "this will be valid for the time increment @xmath281 , i.e. , we are considering only the zeroth iterate of caustic surfing .",
    "the vanishing gradient of the lagrangian @xmath294 with respect to @xmath295 and the multiplier @xmath296 yields @xmath297 .",

    "the wavefront is essentially spherical , but as it progresses away from the lens plane the central section of the wavefront begins to lag behind the rest of the wavefront , eventually folding and developing multiple sheets .",
    "the progression of the wavefront in time shows different regimes , from smooth to various singular types . in the following ,",

    "these values are chosen for purely pedagogical reasons .",
    "notwithstanding , in making our choice we took care to ensure that the approximation of small angles was met , in order for the plots to be qualitatively representative of lensing problems .",

    "the tip of the spike , which earlier was convex toward the observer , develops a self - intersection and a sharp cuspidal ridge in the form of horizontal `` lips . ''",
    "our use of the term `` lips '' in this context is entirely for descriptive purposes and should not be understood in the technical sense used in arnold s theory , in which the term `` lips '' refers to the @xmath322 planar caustic metamorphosis ( e.g. , pp .",
    "375 - 376 , 381 of @xcite ) .",
    "the surface of the wavefront that faces the observer is now concave , and limited by the two cuspidal ridges outlining the `` lips . '' the two cuspidal ridges pinch off the back convex sheet of the wavefront at two symmetrical swallowtail points .",
    "the swallowtails are best appreciated in the top panel , where a side view of the wavefront is shown .",
    "the bottom panel shows a front view , where the lip character of the cuspidal ridge can be appreciated .",
    "the wavefronts in this regime all have this horizontal lip singularity , but the `` lips '' grow in time continuously after starting out from a single point at the center .",
    "the picture shows the wavefront at @xmath317 , which is still quite early in this regime .",
    "one notable fact about this wavefront is that , locally , it is indistinguishable from the early singular wavefronts in the implosion of a triaxial ellipsoid @xcite , in which case , the cuspidal lip - ridge lies `` in the outside . '' for the gravitational lensing case that we are illustrating , in a global sense , the cuspidal lip - ridge lies `` inside . ''",
    "the next singular regime is illustrated in figure  [ fig : doublelip ] .",
    "the point at the center of the concave sheet of the wavefront facing the observer turns momentarily singular at approximately @xmath323 , and grows another lips singularity , this time vertically oriented . these vertical `` lips '' ride on top of the now mixed convex - concave section of the wavefront and present a concave surface to the observer , as can be appreciated from the two slices in the middle and bottom panels .",
    "the middle panel shows a vertical slice of the wavefront through the optical axis",
    ". it may be difficult to appreciate that the foremost sheet pinches off the underlying originally existing sheet well before touching the originally existing cuspidal ridges at the top and bottom .",
    "the bottom panel shows an optical - axis horizontal slice , where the cuspidal character of the newly created forefront sheet is evident .",
    "the two ends of the vertical `` lips '' are two symmetrical swallowtails .",
    "all the wavefronts in this regime have two perpendicular lips , yielding a total of four swallowtails .",
    "the perpendicular lips grow continuously in time , but the inner lip starts at the center and grows until it touches the outer lips .",
    "this picture shows the wavefront at @xmath324 , which is quite late within this regime since the inner lip is about to merge with the outer one .",
    "the next regime consists entirely of a single wavefront at the critical time when the inner lip singularity merges with the outer one .",
    "this wavefront is represented in figure  [ fig : football ] .",
    "the singular ridge on the wavefront has the general outline of a football in a vertical position , inscribed in an outer astroid or diamond .",
    "the `` football '' outline is the distorted last expression of the inner lip - ridge , whereas the astroid is the distorted last expression of the outer ( original ) horizontal lips . at this time",
    "the two cuspidal ridges merge right before they undergo a permanent change .",
    "the wavefront at this critical time has two swallowtails symmetrically located along the horizontal direction , and two singular points symmetrically located along the vertical direction where the two lips merge . in the context of wavefronts , these points have no greater significance than the merger of a cusp ridge and a swallowtail surface .",
    "however , their greater significance is that they are indicators of the presence of hyperbolic umbilic points in the caustic sheet , which we describe in the next subsubsection .",
    "the figure represents the time @xmath325 , which is close enough to the critical time at the resolution that we are using .",
    "the last regime comprises all the wavefronts later than the critical time at which the inner `` lips '' merge with the outer `` lips . ''",
    "all such late wavefronts have a `` regular '' cuspidal ridge delimiting a concave surface that faces the observer , namely , a cuspidal ridge which is smooth as a curve in three space . behind the foremost concave cap , the wavefront self - intersects and has another cuspidal ridge with four singular points in the general shape of an astroid or diamond .",
    "one such wavefront at time @xmath326 is shown in figure  [ fig : astroid ] .",
    "in this front view , the foremost oval cuspidal ridge is clearly distinguishable , as are the two swallowtails in the back .",
    "however , there are two other swallowtails completing the diamond , which lie behind the foremost oval cap and are blocked from view in this picture . the qualitative structure of the wavefront in the diamond - ridge neighborhood is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : goblet ] .    a very late wavefront at time @xmath327 is shown in figure  [ fig : goblet ] . it can be seen that as time moves on , the oval and diamond cuspidal ridges remain essentially unchanged except that the oval ridge in the foreground grows at a much faster rate than the diamond - shaped ridge in the back , and the wavefront eventually acquires a shape resembling that of a goblet .",
    "the figure shows both a field view of the `` goblet '' and a magnification of the goblet s throat to show the diamond ridge .",
    "the diamond ridge structure is almost ubiquitous in wavefront evolutions that are not axi - symmetric .",
    "for another view of one of these local diamond ridges in wavefronts , we refer the reader to the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : goblet0 ] .",
    "the global `` goblet '' wavefront is typical of spherically symmetric regular potentials , with the major difference that the throat of the goblets in the spherically symmetric case degenerates down to a single point , lacking the complicated diamond structure for the case of elliptical symmetry .",
    "the diamond ridge represents the nondegenerate version of the throat of the goblet .",
    "the goblet s throat has three wavefront sheets , each generically giving rise to an image of the light source .",
    "what we have described in this section are precisely the singularities and metamorphosis of wavefronts in the observer s lightcone in the case of an elliptical potential . in this case",
    ", we found that the wavefronts have three types of singularities : cuspidal ridges , swallowtail points , and points of transversal self - intersections .",
    "these three singularity types are shared by generic wavefronts in space  see p. 55 of @xcite .",
    "we also showed that two kinds of metamorphosis occur for the wavefronts due to an elliptical potential . in the first place , we have found two occurrences of the birth of `` lips '' on the wavefront .",
    "secondly , we have found two hyperbolic umbilic metamorphoses , i.e , the two symmetrical occurrences on the wavefront of the exchange of a swallowtail point from one cuspidal ridge to another .",
    "both metamorphosis are part of arnold s list of metamorphoses of fronts in space  see , for instance , the first and fourth perestroikas in figure  258 on page 489 of @xcite .      if we think of the family of wavefronts for all times @xmath181 as spatial slices of the observer s lightcone , then the collection of all the caustic singularities ( i.e. , cuspidal ridges , swallowtail points ) on the instantaneous wavefronts forms a two - surface in spacetime .",
    "the projection of this two - surface into the comoving space @xmath28 is referred to as a comoving caustic surface .",
    "as a surface in the three - space @xmath28 , the caustic surface is traced in time by the caustics of the traveling wavefront as the front moves away from the observer .",
    "the metamorphoses of the wavefront s caustics thus build up a picture of the caustic surface s singularities .",
    "the generic singularities of a caustic surface in three - space are of five different types : folds , cuspidal ridges , swallowtail points , elliptic umbilic points and hyperbolic umbilic points @xcite .",
    "we showed that the caustic surface on an observer s lightcone is given by equation ( [ eq - comov - caustic - surface - z ] ) . in the particular case of the elliptical potential ,",
    "the resulting caustic surface is shown in figure  [ fig : caustic ] .",
    "a significant feature of our caustic surface in three - space is that it consists of two separate intersecting sheets , one for each non - trivial root ( [ eq - zpm ] ) of the jacobian determinant in ( [ eq - det - dszdr ] ) .",
    "the two bottom panels in the figure show the two component sheets .",
    "one sheet starts closer to the observer as a horizontal `` beak '' and then develops a diamond cross section .",
    "the second sheet starts inside the first one as a vertical `` beak '' and eventually opens up into a smooth surface with an oval cross section .",
    "the transitions of both sheets take place at the points where they intersect .",
    "the points of intersection where the vertical beak disappears from the second component sheet and the vertical cusp ridge appears on the first component sheet are hyperbolic umbilic points  there are two such points .",
    "we can also at this point give the exact value of the time of the first singular wavefront .",
    "this is the smaller of @xmath328 and @xmath329 since rays passing through the origin have the longest delay ( as is evidenced from the spike ) . for the previous subsubsection",
    ", we have @xmath330 and @xmath331 , i.e. , the first singular wavefront is the surface at @xmath318 , as anticipated .    by slicing the caustic sheet with constant-@xmath69 surfaces",
    "we obtain a series of planar caustics representing the metamorphosis of the hyperbolic umbilic .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig : planarcaustic ] and coincide with the well - known caustic curves in the gravitational lensing literature for an elliptical potential  e.g. , p. 386 of @xcite .",
    "beautiful photographs of caustic metamorphoses are shown in @xcite  see p. 68",
    "for the hyperbolic umbilic metamorphosis .",
    "we shall illustrate the wavefront singularities and caustic surface due to a singular elliptical potential , namely , the case of vanishing core radius ( @xmath332 ) . in this case",
    ", it is simpler to use polar coordinates @xmath333 on the lens plane .",
    "we have for the potential , _ ep^sing ( r , ) & & a_0 + & = & a_0   r , and for the associated bending angle , @xmath334 which has no dependence on @xmath335 .",
    "the potential vanishes at the origin @xmath336 .",
    "this case is singular because the surface mass density associated with the potential blows up at the origin of the lens plane ( i.e. , @xmath337 as @xmath338 ) .",
    "the center of the lens ( i.e. , the origin ) thus acts as an obstruction to the light rays  see @xcite ) and p. 544 of @xcite for a detailed treatment of obstruction points .",
    "soon after going through the lens plane , the wavefronts evolve markedly differently from the nonsingular case . for our illustrations ,",
    "we have used the following values of the lens parameters : @xmath339 . as in the regular case",
    ", these values are chosen for pedagogical reasons , although taking care to respect the approximations of small angles .",
    "due to the obstruction at the center of the lens ( i.e. , the origin ) , all the wavefronts are singular and there are only two regimes .",
    "the first regime consists entirely of a single wavefront ( the earliest one to make it past the lens plane ) with an interior spike pointing towards the observer , as did the wavefronts of the nonsingular elliptical potential .",
    "however , in this singular case the spike is conical , and touches the lens plane at the origin .",
    "the point at the tip of the spike is removed .",
    "this wavefront , @xmath340 , is shown in figure  [ fig : spike0 ] .",
    "the figure shows both a field view of the wavefront , and a side view of the tip of the spike magnified to make the conical character apparent .    at all times afterwards , the wavefronts resemble a goblet  the second regime .",
    "however , these goblets are markedly different from those that resulted at late times in the nonsingular elliptical potential case .",
    "there is a single diamond - shaped cuspidal ridge , which lies at the throat of the goblet .",
    "the rim of the goblet is removed and acts as a boundary of the wavefront .",
    "these goblets lack the interior concave surface facing the observer that characterizes the goblets in the nonsingular case .",
    "the throat of the goblet has three sheets , each typically giving rise to an image of the source .",
    "one such wavefront in this regime ( @xmath341 ) is illustrated in figure  [ fig : goblet0 ] , where a field view evidences the resemblance to a goblet .",
    "the bottom panel in the figure shows a magnified view of the throat of the `` goblet '' where the diamond structure is evident .",
    "two questions relating to this imperfect `` goblet '' wavefront arise . in the first place ,",
    "do the wavefronts ever detach from the lens plane , or , on the contrary , do they reach out to the obstruction point ?",
    "as one can appreciate in figure  [ fig : history0 ] , where a given portion of the initial wavefront at @xmath342 is followed up and plotted again at @xmath341 , _ the wavefront does not remain attached to the lens plane . _",
    "the second question is whether the rim of the goblet is planar , namely , whether it lies on a constant-@xmath69 plane . _",
    "the answer is no . _",
    "the rim of the goblet is a space curve , which is plotted in figure  [ fig : goblet0rim ] .",
    "it must be kept in mind that the rim is the boundary of the wavefront .",
    "this rim is removed because it is the image of the point @xmath336 on the lens plane under the wavefront lensing map , i.e. , @xmath343 , which is a space curve for fixed @xmath181 .",
    "explicitly , equations ( [ eq - zwavefront ] ) and ( [ eq - swavefront ] ) yield that [ eq - s - z - sep ] ( 0 , , t ) & = & + & & +   z_l  _ ep^sing ( ) , + & & + z(0 , , t ) & = & . + & & as is seen from these equations ,",
    "the ultimate reason why the wavefronts have a whole elliptical curve s worth of boundary points instead of only one point is that the bending angle vector field @xmath344 does not depend on @xmath335 .    in rectangular coordinates ,",
    "the map @xmath344 is ill - defined at the origin @xmath345 .",
    "it has a singularity of the type 0/0 since @xmath346 one can approach the singular point from different directions in the lens plane and hope that the limit would be the same in all directions .",
    "however , the limiting value of the @xmath347 as @xmath348 is direction - dependent , as signaled by the direction - dependent bending angle @xmath349 in ( [ eq - s - z - sep ] ) . in this atypically singular case , obstructing one light ray ( the one that passes through the center of the lens ) removes an elliptical curve s worth of points on the wavefront .",
    "if a source is outside the rim , then one lensed image is seen of the source , while two images are seen if the source is inside the rim .",
    "this phenomenon seems to have been first noted on p. 188 of @xcite for the case of a singular isothermal sphere ( i.e. , @xmath350 ) , where the rim is a circle , as discussed in subsection  [ subsec : singiso ]      the caustic sheet in this case is obtained by the same method as in the case of a nonsingular elliptical potential .",
    "the use of polar coordinates @xmath333 simplifies the calculation .",
    "we have & = & ( 2 )   + & = & ( 2 ) ( - ) , where @xmath351 and @xmath352 are the cartesian components of the lensing map @xmath124 . in this case",
    ", the components reduce to [ eq - sing - epxy ] x & = & (   r - ) , + y & = & (   r - ) , + and the vanishing of the jacobian determinant  see equation ( [ eq - det - dszdr ] )  becomes 0 & = & = .",
    "the unphysical root @xmath353 , which defines the plane of the observer , is responsible for the absence of a second component caustic sheet , the most notable aspect of the caustic sheet in the singular case .",
    "the ( one component ) caustic sheet is obtained from the non - trivial root , i.e. , @xmath354    a plot of the caustic sheet is shown in figure  [ fig : caustic0 ] .",
    "the surface has four cuspidal ridges with a conical profile , which can clearly be appreciated in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "the tip of the caustic surface lies at the center of the lens ( origin ) and is removed . slicing the caustic sheet with constant@xmath355 planes",
    "we obtain the @xmath69-planar caustic curves .",
    "the planar caustics are astroid - shaped curves with four cusps , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : planarcaustic0 ] .",
    "a source inside the caustic curve has four lensed images , while a source outside has two .",
    "the singular elliptical potential provides an excellent opportunity to illustrate the caustic surfing scheme .",
    "we start by pointing out that the caustic sheet , which is parametrically given by ( [ eq - sing - epxy ] ) and ( [ eq - sing - epzc ] ) , can equivalently be given by the following expression : @xmath356 this expression assumes that the apex of the lightcone where the caustic lies is at the origin of coordinates , and the lens plane is at a distance @xmath71 from it .",
    "suppose now that a source is moving on the light source plane with an approximately constant velocity @xmath357 , carrying its own lightcone with it .",
    "then the caustic on the source s lightcone moves as well , and at any given instant of conformal time @xmath358 , assuming the motion is sufficiently slow , the caustic surface can be given as @xmath359 .",
    "assume that a space - borne telescope observes at time @xmath298 an image of the source at peak magnification .",
    "> from the location of the image , by the ( comoving ) lens map we can determine the location @xmath120 of the source on the source plane .",
    "but for our purposes we need to switch the point of view and think of the lightcone of the source instead : the source lies at the origin and the telescope at a location @xmath360 where @xmath277 and @xmath278 are the distance between the telescope and the lens plane , and between the lens plane and the source plane , resp . because @xmath361 lies on the comoving future caustic sheet of the source at @xmath284",
    ", we have [ eq - implicitt0 ] s_0(_0)= 0 = ( ( 1+)x_0 ^ 2)^13 + ( ( 1- ) y_0 ^ 2)^13-(2a_0_tl)^23 , where we have made the substitution @xmath362 .",
    "now , we calculate the speed @xmath363 that the telescope needs to stay on the caustic sheet during the time increment @xmath364 > from our discussion in section  [ sec - causticsurfing ] , specifically eq .",
    "( [ eq - vmin ] ) , we have _ min & = & + & & + & & ( ( ) ^13 , ( ) ^13 , -()^13 ) in this expression , all the symbols are known in principle .",
    "the values of @xmath365 and @xmath366 can be found via the lens mapping at the observation event , as explained above .",
    "clearly , this may be a technically complex procedure , considering that it is only a first step in a iterative scheme to place the telescope on the caustic sheet .",
    "our main purpose is to show that the calculation is feasible in principle .      for a singular isothermal sphere lens",
    ", we have @xmath367 .",
    "the potential and bending angle vector are given respectively as follows : @xmath368 the wavefronts are similar to those of the singular elliptical potential , except that the throat of the goblet is a point and the singular rim of the goblet is a circle  see figure  [ fig : wavefront - sis ] .",
    "the caustic surface collapses to a line coinciding with the portion of the optical axis beyond the lens plane ( i.e. , @xmath369 ) .",
    "note the origin on the lens plane , which is a singularity of the lens , is not a part of the caustic line .",
    "we have that each @xmath69-planar caustic is a point .",
    "we have shown how to construct a lensing map that takes points on the lens plane into points on a wavefront surface , as opposed to a source plane .",
    "this represents a sort of `` instantaneous '' lens map , carrying a sense of constant time .",
    "by contrast , the standard lens map carries no sense of time at all .",
    "additionally , the wavefront lensing map has an asymmetric jacobian matrix .",
    "notice that , barring multiple sheets , the wavefront surface lies very close to a plane in the weak - field case , as illustrated in most of our figures . in the figures the optical axis",
    "is magnified several times in order to appreciate the distance between the different sheets in the folded wavefront .",
    "our intial motivation for explicitly constructing a wavefront - lens mapping was inspired by several works ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this respect",
    ", it appears that an extension of our constructions in secs .",
    "iii and iv beyond the weak field domain is feasible  @xcite .",
    "we took advantage of the conformally flat nature of the flat fl universe in order to make use of a comoving lens equation , which in addition to being comoving is also a conformal lens equation . a conformally related flat spacetime exists , of course , in all three types of fl universes , so in principle",
    ", our wavefront map could be adapted for interpretation in the open or closed universes . however , in such universes the conformal factor relating the fl universes to the corresponding flat spacetime depends on the space point , as well as the time , and the translation of our conformal present proper length function to a cosmological present proper length is not at all as direct as we found it in this work . some of the subtleties that would be involved in the translation in the open and closed cases are treated in detail by frittelli , kling and newman @xcite , where the conformally flat lens map and time delay are transformed into the cosmological lensing map and time delay . nonetheless , we do not need to rely on the conformally related flat space to calculate our present proper length function .",
    "the individual wavefronts for the potentials illustrated proved useful in visualizing the relationship between the location of the source in reference to the caustic , and the number of images observed .",
    "additionally , the wavefronts of the singular potentials helped explain the anomalous counting of images observed by petters , levine , and wambsganss @xcite , p. 188 .",
    "the latter showed that in the case of the singular potentials there is a simple closed curve , that is not a caustic , but that separates regions in the source plane where the number of images differs by one , rather than two .",
    "we have here shown that such a curve is the boundary of the wavefront , it is not a caustic , and the number of images differs by one less than in the regular case because one whole sheet of the wavefront is missing due to an obstruction in the lens plane .",
    "lastly , we have taken a step towards a preliminary scheme for caustic surfing in a meaningful and consistent manner .",
    "the form of the subsequent iterations remains an open problem , as does the implementation of the procedure , particularly the measurement of the transverse velocity of the the moving source that one intends to follow .",
    "clearly the caustic surfing proposal depends only on the caustic surface , and not on the method used to obtain it .",
    "but the point is that optimal caustic surfing ( with the least effort ) is achieved only by allowing the telescope to surf the caustic sheet , rather than the planar caustics at fixed distance from the source .",
    "one could also image scenarios where a telescope may not ride a caustic sheet , but move so as to stay inside certain chambers of the caustic surface ( compare with gaudi and gould @xcite ) , possibly near higher order singularities .",
    "future studies of the aforementioned issues are clearly warranted .",
    "we are indebetd to scott gaudi , marek kossowki , and joachim wambsganss for discussions .",
    "we are especially thankful to jrgen ehlers for valuable critical feedback on the manuscript , in particular regarding the difficulties with the validity of the standard approximations in astrophysical gravitational lensing .",
