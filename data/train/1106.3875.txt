    "the nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest unsolved problems in cosmology . over the last 20 years or so",
    ", the identification of dark matter with elementary particles has received widespread support .",
    "this idea is primarily motivated by the acceptance that the observed density of dark matter far exceeds the density of baryonic material predicted to be created in the standard big bang cosmology , with the implication that the dark matter must be in non - baryonic form .",
    "elementary particles have been seen as the most obvious choice here as , despite the lack of any observational evidence , theoretical predictions from extensions to the standard model of particle physics provide a number of different particles as dark matter candidates .",
    "much effort has been put into detecting such particles directly , but so far there has been no success @xcite .",
    "in fact the parameter space to be searched is very large , and potential dark matter particles have by no means been ruled out , but it is perhaps worthwhile at this stage to review the status of other candidates .",
    "( 0,280 ) ( 250,0 )     the requirement that dark matter be non - baryonic puts a major constraint on any alternative to elementary particles .",
    "in particular , the idea that dark matter is in the form of compact bodies has been treated with some scepticism , as familiar objects such as stellar remnants or brown dwarfs , being baryonic , are ruled out as candidates .",
    "however , there are possibilities for compact bodies which are non - baryonic . the most thoroughly investigated of these are primordial black holes . a strong case has been made that in the early universe density fluctuations could lead to copious production of primordial black holes @xcite .",
    "such black holes are most likely to be formed at epochs when the universe undergoes phase transitions , with masses dominated by the horizon mass at formation @xcite . in particular , black holes formed during the qcd phase transition a few microseconds after the big bang should have masses peaking at the qcd horizon mass scale of around @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as these objects would be created well before the epoch of baryon synthesis , they would not be subject to the constraints on baryon mass density .",
    "the detection of dark matter in the form of compact bodies has received much attention in the literature . in an early paper , press & gunn ( 1973 ) pointed out that in a universe where the density of matter is equal to the critical density , every line of sight will be gravitationally lensed .",
    "this means that if the dark matter is in the form of compact bodies , they will have the effect of distorting the image of any distant light source . for bodies of around a solar mass",
    "the characteristic timescale for changes in brightness is a few years .",
    "this domain of gravitational lensing , known as microlensing , opens up the potential for detecting dark matter in this form by observing changes in brightness of distant compact light sources such as quasars .",
    "much work has been done by several groups in simulating the light curves expected from microlensing , with the idea of comparing the results with observed quasar variability @xcite .",
    "there is however a problem with this approach , as any intrinsic quasar variability must be taken into account .",
    "there is one situation where quasar microlensing can be identified unambiguously .",
    "there are now many known examples of a massive galaxy producing multiple images by the gravitational lensing of a more distant quasar along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "any intrinsic variation in the quasar will be observed in all images , with some time difference due to the differing path lengths to the images . however , in all quasar systems which have been adequately observed , it has been found that for the most part individual images vary independently .",
    "this is widely recognised as being due to microlensing @xcite , and supports the idea that all quasars are being microlensed .",
    "there is however a caveat , that as these systems are known to have a massive galaxy close to the line of sight , normal stars in this lensing galaxy might be responsible for the microlensing .",
    "( 0,280 ) ( 250,0 )     perhaps the best known search for compact bodies is for those in the halo of the galaxy . by monitoring several million stars in the lmc and smc , bodies of around a solar mass were detected by the macho project @xcite .",
    "the detection rate of these bodies implies a larger population than can be accounted for by known stellar populations , and so they are clearly good dark matter candidates .",
    "however , they have been discounted on the basis that they make up insufficient dark matter for the predictions of models of the galactic halo consistent with available observations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to review the arguments that compact bodies in the form of primordial black holes make up the dark matter component of the universe .",
    "we shall firstly look at the evidence for microlensing in quasar light curves , which includes time dilation measures , comparison with microlensing simulations , chromatic changes and statistical symmetry .",
    "much of this work has already been published , but the comparison of the simulations with observations is new , and work on colour changes and symmetry is updated .",
    "we derive a further test for microlensing by comparing changes in continuum and emission line flux .",
    "although this has been done before , we use new and very much improved data here .",
    "we then examine from a new perspective the claim that microlensing in multiply imaged quasar systems is caused by stars in the lensing galaxy .",
    "finally , we use the galactic halo microlensing observations of the macho collaboration together with the most recent measurements of the halo parameters to re - determine the optical depth to microlensing , and hence the limit on dark matter in the form of compact bodies .",
    "( 0,200 ) ( 250,0 )     if primordial black holes make up the bulk of dark matter , then they should betray their presence by microlensing the light of distant quasars .",
    "the structure of the resulting light curves has been the subject of extensive research , in the form of computer simulations and theoretical studies .",
    "fourier power spectrum analysis is perhaps the most useful tool for comparing the observed variability of quasars with the results from numerical simulations , but structure functions and auto - correlation functions have also been used .",
    "we start with some definitions and formulae .",
    "the einstein radius @xmath1 of a gravitational lens is defined as    @xmath2    which thus varies as the square root of the lens mass @xmath3 .",

    "the change of brightness with time @xmath13 is thus given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the minimum distance from the trajectory of the lens to the source in units of einstein radius , @xmath16 is the time of closest approach of the lens to the source , and @xmath17 is the speed of the source in units of einstein radius per unit time . for multiple lenses",
    "there are no simple analytic solutions , and the changes in brightness must be obtained from simulations .",
    "the first simulations of microlensing at large optical depth were published by paczyski ( 1986a ) .",
    "this early work modelled a single plane with randomly placed lenses , and a point source moving across it relative to the observer .",
    "kayser et al . ( 1986 ) extended this work using an inverse ray tracing technique , to include the case of extended sources .",
    "improvements in numerical techniques @xcite enabled more complicated lens distributions and source parameters to be modelled .",
    "for the purposes of comparing the observed quasar light curves with flux variations from microlensing , we shall use the simulations of minty ( 2001 ) .",
    "we choose these simulations as they are the development of the earlier work cited above , but incorporating a 3-dimensional lens distribution and , importantly for the purposes of this paper , the results are presented in the form of fourier power spectra of the microlensing variations , which is essential for comparison with observations .",
    "the ray tracing procedure is described by minty et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , together with an illustration of a simulated microlensing light curve .    in these simulations",
    "the lenses are distributed on multiple planes , and move independently with a random velocity drawn from a gaussian distribution .",
    "rays are traced back from the observer and their position in the source plane recorded , which then enables the magnification pattern to be calculated .",
    "the lenses are then moved according to their random velocity and the ray - tracing procedure is repeated , allowing the simulation to evolve over time .",
    "the 3-dimensional lens distribution puts great demands on computer power , and so the simulations were carried out on a number of parallel platforms at the edinburgh parallel computing centre ( epcc ) .",
    "the magnification patterns in the observer plane allow the variations in brightness due to microlensing to be converted to simulated light curves for sources with specified light profiles .",
    "this procedure was used to generate large numbers of light curves for which fourier power spectra were calculated .",
    "this format is well suited to comparing the characteristics of microlensing variations with observed light curves , for which fourier power spectra can also be calculated .",

    "it is well established that the individual quasar images vary partly synchronously with a short time gap , and partly independently .",

    "however , in all systems which have been studied in sufficient detail the images also vary independently , and this is generally accepted as being due to microlensing by compact bodies along the light paths , where each image would be affected differently .    it is tempting to interpret this microlensing as persuasive evidence that quasars are being microlensed by a cosmological distribution of compact dark matter bodies , but there is an important caveat . by their very nature ,",
    "in these quasar systems there will always be a massive galaxy close to the line of sight , and typically the quasar light paths will pass through this galaxy .",
    "it has generally been assumed that the stellar population in the lensing galaxy is sufficient to provide the population of lensing bodies , but because of the sparse distribution of stars in galactic halos this assumption may not always be reliable .",
    "the gravitational lens system q0957 + 561 , comprising two quasar images and a massive elliptical lensing galaxy , is well suited to investigating the feasibility of microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy . since its discovery in 1979 @xcite ,",

    "alternatively , a cosmological distribution of dark matter in the form of compact bodies could be responsible for the observed microlensing .",
    "either way , this result implies dark matter in the form of stellar mass compact bodies .",

    "we shall consider the various possibilities in more detail .",
    "perhaps the most plausible candidates for compact dark matter bodies are low mass stars and stellar remnants . for stars with mass @xmath42",
    "the observed background radiation density puts tight constraints on @xmath43 , the stellar contribution to dark matter , and on this basis carr ( 1994 ) finds @xmath44 . for stars with @xmath45 gilmore ( 1999 ) uses arguments for the universality of the imf and direct mid - infrared observations to constrain the contribution of @xmath43 in galactic halos to negligible proportions .",
    "notwithstanding observations such as these , there would always remain the possibility that baryonic matter could remain hidden in some unexpected form were it not for the constraints of cosmological nucleosynthesis , which we now consider .    the standard theory of primordial nucleosynthesis makes predictions for the abundance of the light elements d , @xmath46he , @xmath47he and @xmath48li .",
    "these abundances depend , with varying sensitivity , on the baryon to photon ratio @xmath49 .",
    "comparison of the predictions with astronomical observations of the abundances only shows consistent agreement over a narrow range of @xmath49 .",
    "this consistency has the dual effect of giving strong support to the standard theory of primordial nucleosynthesis , and providing a robust measure of @xmath49 .",
    "the photon density may be readily obtained from measures of the cosmic microwave background , giving a value for the baryon density @xmath50 in the range @xmath51 @xcite . for @xmath25",
    "km sec@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 this gives @xmath52 .",
    "this limit effectively rules out any candidates for dark matter in the form of compact bodies which are made up of baryons , and certainly excludes familiar bodies such as stars and planets and any remnants of their evolution .",
    "the only non - baryonic compact bodies which have so far been seriously proposed as dark matter candidates are primordial black holes @xcite . hawking ( 1971 ) showed that density fluctuations in the early universe could lead to gravitational collapse , and carr & hawking ( 1974 ) argued that this collapse could lead to the formation of black holes of around the horizon mass @xmath53 at time @xmath13 , where    @xmath54    carr ( 1975 ) examined the expected primordial black hole mass spectrum , and concluded that the density fluctuations invoked to seed the formation of galaxies are of a type to favour primordial black hole production over a large mass range .",
    "as density fluctuations larger than the horizon size enter into the particle horizon they can be close to their schwarzschild radius , and depending on the balance between pressure and gravity may collapse to become black holes . for a hard equation of state where pressure @xmath55 and energy density @xmath56 are equated by @xmath57 , regions with overdensity @xmath58 should collapse into black holes of the order of the horizon mass @xmath53 from eq .",

    "fluctuations smaller than this will tend to disperse due to pressure forces . for a soft equation of state",
    "where @xmath59 , black holes should form much more readily from small relic adiabatic perturbations .",
    "the problem with this approach as it stands is that a scale invariant power spectrum normalised to the cmb fluctuations produces a negligible density of primordial black holes .",
    "( 0,200 ) ( 250,0 )     during phase transitions in the early universe , and in particular during the quark - hadron transition of the qcd epoch at a cosmic epoch of @xmath60 sec , the equation of state is expected to soften .",
    "jedamzik ( 1997 ) concluded that the primordial black hole mass function should show a pronounced peak at the qcd mass scale @xmath61 .",
    "this result was confirmed by general relativistic hydrodynamic numerical simulations which showed that the fluctuation density threshold @xmath62 for black hole formation falls when the universe undergoes phase transitions , to produce a mass spectrum dominated by the horizon masses at the transition epochs @xcite .",
    "bullock & primack ( 1997 ) argued that non - gaussian density fluctuations produced during inflation could prevent over - production of black holes , as well as providing a source of large amplitude fluctuations .",
    "this would be consistent with black hole production at the qcd mass scale , although widerin & schmid ( 1998 ) claimed that some additional fine tuning would be necessary .",
    "yokoyama ( 1997 ) adopted a different approach , making the case that for inflation models with multiple scalar fields , isocurvature fluctuations are generated which , with a suitable choice of model parameters , produce primordial black holes with masses peaked at the macho mass scale .",
    "this idea has been developed @xcite in the context of the double inflation models . in this framework ,",
    "primordial black holes with a narrow mass distribution can be produced in sufficient abundance to make up the dark matter , and with natural values for the model parameters will produce masses in the macho range .",
    "( 0,280 ) ( 250,0 )     for the last 20 years or so there has been a generally held view that dark matter is predominantly in the form of elementary particles .",
    "this is based in part upon the belief that there are no other suitable non - baryonic candidates , but it is also motivated by the limits on machos derived from microlensing studies .",
    "this paper has set out to make the case that stellar mass primordial black holes provide viable alternative candidates .",
    "these bodies are not sufficiently massive to form luminous accretion discs , and can only be detected through the effects of gravitation , in particular gravitational lensing . in the case of bodies of around a solar mass ,",
    "the changes in the lensing pattern have a timescale of the order of several years , which opens up the possibility of detecting them by observations of microlensing .",
    "if primordial black holes make up a substantial proportion of dark matter , then every line of sight will be distorted at some level by gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "this means that for compact light sources such as quasars , the effects of microlensing should be detectable in their light curves .",
    "variations due to microlensing exhibit a number of well - defined characteristics which , if observed , would thus indicate the presence of primordial black holes . in section  [ sec2 ] we focus on four properties of the light curves that should be present if the variations in flux are predominantly the result of microlensing .",
    "ideally , one would like to compare the predictions for microlensing and for models of intrinsic variation such as accretion disc instability , with observed quasar light curves .",
    "unfortunately , at present no models of intrinsic variation make predictions that are sufficiently precise to be useful for comparison with observations .",
    "microlensing on the other hand results in specific predictions which can be tested experimentally .",
    "there is one test which can distinguish between microlensing and intrinsic variations , in spite of the difficulties of modelling the latter .",
    "the absence of time dilation seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is not consistent with any mechanism for intrinsic variabilty in quasars , but it is in agreement with the predictions for microlensing . of the other three properties of quasar light curves described in section  [ sec2 ] , none can strictly speaking exclude intrinsic variation , given the lack of constraint on models of quasar emission .",
    "however , the purpose of this paper is to show that the observations are consistent with the much more precise predictions for microlensing by primordial black holes .",
    "microlensing simulations allow one to predict the shape of the light curve seds , and as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] there is good agreement with the observations . without this agreement",
    "the case for microlensing would be severely weakened .",
    "the question of colour changes with variation in flux is more complicated .",
    "it is well known that gravitational lensing is essentially an achromatic process @xcite , with the expectation that for microlensing there will no change in colour with brightness . however , in the case of a resolved source , that is a source significantly larger than the einstein radius of the lenses , this will not necessarily be true .",
    "for example , if the source has a radial colour gradient , blue in the centre and reddening outwards , then the blue light profile , being more compact , will be preferentially amplified relative to the red as the lenses cross the source @xcite .",
    "in fact , as we have seen in section  [ sec3 ] , for bodies around a solar mass the einstein radius is typically much larger than the quasar accretion disc and so the variations are expected to be achromatic .",
    "this is what was found for the quasar light curves analysed in section  [ sec2 ] , in agreement with the predictions for primordial black holes .",
    "another property predicted for light curves from microlensing is statistical symmetry , and again the results in section  [ sec2 ] show no evidence for asymmetry .",
    "it is not clear to what extent predictions for intrinsic variations favour symmetry . despite the work of kawaguchi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , they are most likely to be model and timescale dependent .",
    "the point of significance for this paper is that all the features of quasar light curves analysed here are consistent with the predictions for microlensing by solar mass primordial black holes .",
    "changes in quasar spectra with variations in brightness provide an alternative way of testing for the presence of compact bodies .",
    "there is abundant evidence that broad emission lines respond to changes in continuum brightness , but the presence of a near critical density of primordial black holes implies that the continuum source will also vary with no corresponding change in broad line strength as a result of microlensing .",
    "this is clearly seen in figs  [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , and the evidence points to longer timescales of variation being associated with microlensing events . in the case of multiple quasar systems , the intrinsic features seen in both light curves , and used to measure time delay , are typically of small amplitude and duration . on the other hand ,",
    "microlensing events as measured from the difference between the light curves of individual images tend to be of large amplitude and to last for tens of years , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "the various constraints discussed above suggest a picture in which for low luminosity seyfert i galaxies , observed variations are dominated by short timescale changes in flux accompanied by changes in colour and broad emission line strength . for more luminous quasars",
    "the amplitude of these intrinsic variations decreases , and at higher redshift the light curves become dominated by the effects of microlensing , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "these variations occur on a longer timescale of around 20 years , are close to being achromatic , and do not affect the broad line region .",
    "the expectation from eq .",
    "[ eqn9 ] is that with increasing luminosity , the amplitude of variation will become smaller as the size of the emitting region gets larger .",
    "the idea that there is a correlation between the way quasars vary and their absolute magnitude or luminosity has a long history .",
    "in particular , several authors @xcite have claimed to find an anti - correlation between luminosity and amplitude , in the sense that for a sample of quasar light curves , more luminous quasars are seen to vary over a smaller range of brightness than less luminous ones .",
    "one of the problems with this conclusion is that the observed amplitude is clearly a function of the length of the run of observations , and so can be confused with timescale of variability .",
    "fourier analysis provides a way round this by giving measures of variability on different timescales .",
    "the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the combined sed for the samples of light curves described in section  [ sec2 ] , and fitted with the function @xmath63 in eq .",
    "[ eqn7 ] . in the right hand panel",
    "the data is divided into three lumnosity ranges , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the three curves show broadly the same features as the curve in the left hand panel , but it is clear that the anti - correlation between luminosity and amplitude is confirmed . the maximum power density of the lowest luminosity quasars is greater than the highest by a factor of 1.5 . in this case",
    "it appears that the time span of the data is sufficient to resolve the degeneracy between timescale and amplitude .",
    "this is consistent with the model outlined above .",
    "for some time here has been a tendency to dismiss the idea that dark matter is in the form of primordial black holes or other compact bodies on the grounds that the macho collaboration observations of lmc stars have conflicted with predictions of the microlensing event rate .",
    "this would mean the falsification of the theory , regardless of the arguments in its favour @xcite .",
    "we have shown in section  [ sec4 ] that using more recent parameters for galactic structure and dynamics there need be no discrepancy between predicted and observed event rates , and hence there are viable halo models where the dark matter is in the form of stellar mass compact bodies .",
    "the results of section  [ sec5 ] even suggest that such bodies may have already been routinely detected in photometric monitoring of multiply lensed quasar systems .",
    "this means that the case for primordial black holes as dark matter can be considered on its merits , and contrasted with arguments favouring dark matter in the form of elementary particles .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that stellar mass primordial black holes are plausible dark matter candidates .",
    "these objects would have been created during the qcd phase transition at a cosmic epoch of around @xmath67 sec .",
    "such bodies are not easy to detect , but should betray their presence through the effect of their gravitational fields .",
    "the most readily observable manifestion of this is the gravitational microlensing of quasars .",
    "we have used power fourier spectrum analysis of a large sample of quasar light curves to compare with the results of numerical simulations , and the predictions for time dilation , colour change and statistical symmetry from microlensing by a near critical density of primordial black holes .",
    "we have also compared the predictions for spectral changes as a result of microlensing with spectrophotometric observations of quasars .",
    "finally , we make the case that the observed microlensing in multiple quasar systems is best explained by a population of dark matter bodies rather than stars .",
    "the main objection to the idea of dark matter in the form of compact bodies has come from the search for machos in the galactic halo . by observing the microlensing rate of stars in the magellanic clouds , and adopting a dark matter model for the halo , the macho collaboration deduced a mass fraction in compact bodies of around 20% .",
    "we have re - worked their analysis using using the most recent values for the structure and dynamics of the halo , and find that there is now no conflict between the observed microlensing rate and a macho dominated halo .",
    "the results of this paper do not establish that dark matter is made up of stellar mass primordial black holes .",

    "<S> a near critical density of compact bodies implies that most lines of sight will be gravitationally microlensed , and the paper focuses on looking for the predicted effects on quasar brightness and spectral variations . </S>",
    "<S> these signatures of microlensing include the shape of the fourier power spectrum of the light curves , near achromatic and statistically symmetric variations , and the absence of time dilation in the timescale of variability . for spectral changes it is predicted that as the continuum varies there is little corresponding change in the strength of the broad lines . in all these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the observations are found to be consistent with the predictions for microlensing by a population of stellar mass compact bodies . for multiply lensed quasar systems where the images vary independently and </S>",
    "<S> microlensing is the generally accepted explanation , the case is made that stellar populations are too small to produce the observed effects , and that the only plausible alternative is a population of compact dark matter bodies of around a stellar mass along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the most serious objection to dark matter in the form of compact bodies has come from observations of microlensing of stars in the magellanic clouds . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the expected event rate is re - analysed using more recent values for the structure and dynamics of the galactic halo , and it is shown that there is then no conflict with the observations . finally , the possible identity of a near critical density of dark matter in the form of stellar mass compact bodies is reviewed , with the conclusion that by far the most plausible candidates are primordial black holes formed during the qcd epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the overall conclusion of the paper is that primordial black holes should be seen alongside elementary particles as viable dark matter candidates .    </S>",
