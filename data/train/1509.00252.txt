    "the self - consistent mean - field approach , based on an energy density functional ( edf ) , is a tool of choice to study nuclei in any region of the nuclear chart  @xcite .",
    "it allows to calculate the properties of the ground state but also of alternative configurations , like shape isomers , or to follow the behaviur of a nucleus along rotational bands or along fission paths .",
    "often , one is not directly interested in the total binding energy of a specific nucleus but by its evolution along a series of isotopes or isotones , which can signal structural changes for given neutron or proton numbers .    motivated by the needs of the nuclear physics and astrophysics communities ,",
    "large efforts are underway to push the predictive power of nuclear mass models well below the 500kev level . to reach this goal ,",
    "the protocols used to adjust the edf s parameters have been revisited . in particular ,",
    "methods are being developed  @xcite to quantify the statistical uncertainty of these parameters . however , besides the errors on observables due to these uncertainties , there is also a numerical error due to the way the scmf equations are solved .",
    "one needs to verify that the numerics does not introduce errors that are larger than the maximum error tolerated for mass models .",
    "more importantly , these errors should not vary too rapidly from one nucleus to the other , to avoid a spurious behavior of mass differences .",
    "the numerical methods used to solve the mean - field equations can be classified according to the way the single - particle wave functions are represented : by coordinate space techniques or by a basis expansion .",
    "coordinate space techniques represent the single - particle wave functions in a discretized , finite volume .",
    "several discretization techniques exist , utilizing finite difference formulas  @xcite , fourier transformations  @xcite , b - splines  @xcite , wavelets  @xcite and the lagrange mesh method  @xcite .",
    "the second family of numerical representations involves expanding the single - particle wave functions on some chosen ( finite ) set of basis states .",
    "usually these basis states are harmonic oscillator ( ho ) eigenstates , although the details often vary .",
    "while the origin of numerical errors is quite different for both families of representations , the type of edf does not seem to influence the accuracy of the methods much .",
    "the three main families ( relativistic edfs , zero - range skyrme edfs or finite - range edfs ) require similar numbers of basis states to achieve a similar precision ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in what follows ,",
    "we will limit ourselves to the study of zero - range skyrme edfs .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study the numerical accuracy of a specific implementation of coordinate space techniques : representation on a three - dimensional cartesian mesh of equidistant points .",
    "we will focus on two specific techniques : finite - difference ( fd ) formulas and the lagrange mesh ( lm ) method , which are the ones implemented in our codes . as far as we can infer from the tests published in the literature , the accuracy obtained with the other techniques mentioned above is similar to the one obtained within our lm scheme .",
    "most of the information relative to the tools that we have developed has been presented for the particular implementation made in the code ` ev8 `  @xcite .",
    "more involved implementations have also been used , which differ from ` ev8 ` only in that they impose less symmetries on the nucleus .",
    "the presence of these symmetries in general allows for the reduction of the dimension of the problem , e.g.  in ` ev8 ` it allows for the reduction of the space by a factor of 1/8 .",
    "the article is organized as follows : first we define precisely the quantities that will be used to characterize the accuracy of a mean - field calculation .",
    "next , we review the basic ingredients needed to define wave functions on a cartesian mesh and to calculate derivatives and integrals in this representation .",
    "we then discuss the main sources of numerical errors : the size of the box in which the nucleus is confined and the step size of the mesh .",
    "we discuss the numerical accuracy that can be achieved by comparing energies and radii of doubly magic nuclei with those obtained with a spherical code .",
    "finally , we check the convergence of energies , radii and the multipole moments of deformed nuclei by comparing results obtained with decreasing mesh discretization lengths .",
    "a mean - field configuration is characterized by its energy , its rms radius and by multipole moments . in this section",
    "we define these quantities whose dependence on the mesh parameters will be studied .      for a time - reversal invariant system",
    "as assumed here , the total energy is composed of the kinetic energy , the skyrme energy describing the strong interaction in the particle - hole channel , the pairing energy , the coulomb energy and a center - of - mass correction  @xcite @xmath3 for the parameterizations used throughout this article , the skyrme edf takes the form of the sum of various bilinear combinations of the isoscalar ( @xmath4 ) and isovector ( @xmath5 ) local densities @xmath6 , kinetic densities @xmath7 and spin - current densities @xmath8",

    "the kinetic energy just depends on the kinetic density @xmath14 of protons and neutrons . while the skyrme and kinetic energies are local functionals of the densities , the direct coulomb energy is a nonlocal functional of the proton density @xmath15 @xmath16 compared to the other terms contributing to the total energy , the exact calculation of the coulomb exchange energy is orders of magnitude more costly as it is a functional of the complete nonlocal one - body density matrix . as a consequence , the local slater approximation that is of similar numerical cost",
    "as the skyrme energy is used instead @xmath17 the pairing energy contribution to the energy is : @xmath18 where the @xmath19 are anti - symmetrized matrix elements of the pairing interaction and the @xmath20 are cutoff factors , both of which are specified in appendix  [ app : pairing ] .    the expression for the c.m .",
    "correction , which is not relevant for our discussion , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      as in @xcite ,",

    "when @xmath25 is omitted we imply it to be zero .",
    "another set of observables , related to the density profile of the nucleus , are the mean - square ( ms ) radii , root - mean - square ( rms ) radii and the isotopic shifts .",
    "the ms radius of the proton ( @xmath26 ) , neutron ( @xmath27 ) , and total density distribution is defined as @xmath28 \\ ,",
    "r^2 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the root - mean - square ( rms ) radii are then the square root of the corresponding mean - square radius .",
    "similarly , we will present results for the isotope shift of charge radii that are calculated as the difference between the proton ms radius of an isotope with @xmath29 neutrons and a reference isotope with @xmath30 neutrons @xmath31 without any corrections .",
    "assuming a 3-dimensional cartesian mesh , a function @xmath32 is represented by the tensor @xmath33 of its values at the collocation points @xmath34 @xmath35 a mesh can be defined in several ways , depending on the choice of the collocation points . for example , the origin of the coordinate system and the boundaries of the box can be included as collocation points or not .",
    "different choices can also be made for the boundary conditions at the edge of the box .",
    "to set up the self - consistent mean - field equations , one has to vary the edf with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "this requires to define prescriptions to calculate derivatives and integrals from the values of @xmath33 on the mesh .",
    "several choices for derivatives have been explored over the years .      the most straightforward possibility to set - up a coordinate - space representation of the self - consistent mean - field equations is provided by the finite - difference method , a widely - used tool to solve partial differential equations  @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme , the derivatives are calculated with @xmath36-point finite - difference formulas , and the integrals are obtained by summing up the integrand at the mesh points multiplied by a suitable volume element .",
    "there are three factors that determine the accuracy that can be achieved with the finite - difference method .",
    "one is the overall resolution scale provided by the mesh spacing ; decreasing the distance between mesh points improves the accuracy .",
    "second , the higher the order of the finite - difference formulas used for a given mesh spacing the better the accuracy . in both cases , however , better accuracy means also increase of the numerical cost .",
    "third , there are internal inconsistencies introduced by the method itself .",
    "for example , taking twice the numerical first - order derivatives of a given function is not equivalent to applying the numerical second - order derivatives . also , the numerical derivatives are not the inverse of the numerical integration .",
    "it is only for very small step sizes well below 0.1fm that these internal inconsistencies become irrelevant .",
    "while such small step sizes can be easily handled in spherical 1d codes  @xcite , the required storage is prohibitive in axial 2d and cartesian 3d codes .",
    "in addition , such step sizes are much smaller than what can be expected to be the physically relevant resolution scale , see for example the arguments brought forward in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "several other schemes have been developed in the past with a better consistency between derivation and integration .",
    "for instance , derivatives have been defined through a fourier transformation to momentum space  @xcite , which is equivalent to the assumption that the functions on the mesh can be developed into a set of plane waves . in this method ,",
    "the derivatives are quasi - exact for a given resolution of the mesh , and first- and second - order derivatives internally consistent .",
    "similar ideas have been developed in quantum chemistry under the label of _ discrete variable representation _",
    "( dvr )  @xcite .",
    "a similar formalism that provides an internal consistent scheme for derivatives and integrals is the lagrange - mesh method that we will sketch in the following section .",
    "the idea underlying the lagrange - mesh method is that for each gauss quadrature one can construct a set of basis functions for which orthogonality and completeness relations are exactly fulfilled when evaluated with the given quadrature  @xcite",
    ". this additional condition makes the lm method a special case of the slightly less rigorous concept of dvr  @xcite .",
    "lagrange meshes have been constructed for a multitude of different geometries and used for a wide range of applications , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we will use here the case of an equidistant 3d cartesian mesh .",
    "its three directions are separable in the formalism , such that the presentation of the principles of the method for one dimension is sufficient .",
    "the underlying basis of a one - dimensional cartesian equidistant lagrange mesh is constructed as the set of functions @xmath37 whose orthogonality relations are exact when evaluated with a simple @xmath38-point rectangular quadrature rule , sometimes called _ midpoint rule _ ,  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the distance between the collocation points located at @xmath41 and where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the boundaries of the numerical box @xmath44 = [ -n dx , + n dx]$ ] . a convenient representation of the @xmath38 basis functions @xmath37 are plane waves of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the length of the numerical box and where @xmath47 , @xmath48 ,  , @xmath49 .",
    "the real part of the @xmath50 is symmetric , has nodes on the boundaries of the box and a maximum at the origin , whereas their imaginary part is skew - symmetric , consequently has a node at the origin , and maxima on the boundaries of the box .",
    "this also implies that @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52 form a complete set of functions to describe any function on the mesh points @xmath53 note that the box size @xmath54 is not a multiple of the wavelength of the basis functions . instead ,",
    "twice the box size is an odd multiple of the wavelengths that take the values @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ,  @xmath58 .",
    "both the real and imaginary parts of all plane waves in eq .",
    "are non - zero at all mesh points .    as recalled in ref .",
    "@xcite , in cartesian dvr and lm coordinate - space methods where the derivatives are defined through an expansion in plane waves , the analysis of a calculation s infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs introduced by the basis is straightforward .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the much more involved analyses required when working with an ho basis  @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that a dvr or lm representation of the nuclear many - body problem covers the relevant part of the phase space with a much smaller number of basis states than required by an ho basis . in practice , however , ho bases typically used for self - consistent mean - field calculations are much smaller than the typical number of mesh points used in the same kind of calculation .",
    "for a box with 20 points in every direction the number of linearly independent states is 64000 , to be compared with a harmonic oscillator expansion with 20 shells , which contains 14168 states .    while the basis functions @xmath59 of eq .   are useful to discuss the mathematical properties of the lm method , the actual coordinate representation then employs the set of @xmath38 lagrange interpolation functions @xmath60 obtained as  @xcite @xmath61 }             { \\sin \\big[\\frac{\\pi}{dx}\\frac{x - r \\ ,",

    "is then simply represented by its values @xmath66 at the @xmath38 mesh points .",
    "the lagrange functions are smooth and infinitely derivable .",
    "they can be used to define matrices representing the first and second derivatives of functions discretized through . ] eq .     @xmath67}{\\sin^2\\left[\\pi ( i - j)/(2n)\\right ] }             }             & \\text{for $ i \\neq j$ } , \\\\             { \\displaystyle             - \\frac{\\pi^2}{3dx^2 } \\left(1-\\frac{1}{(2n)^2}\\right ) }             & \\text{for $ i = j$. }            \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first derivative of any function @xmath64 on the mesh is obtained by multiplying the @xmath68 matrix @xmath69 by the vector @xmath70 @xmath71 and similar for the second derivatives . note that the derivative matrices have the property @xmath72 by construction  @xcite , which is not the case for finite - difference formulas . as the derivatives of eqs .   and correspond to full @xmath68 matrices , their application is more time consuming than finite - difference derivatives that correspond to a sparse band matrix .",
    "the full cartesian 3d representation of a function @xmath73 is then provided by @xmath74 where the number of discretization points does not have to be the same in each direction . in that case , the derivative matrices in eqs .   and have to be set - up separately for each direction .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , a variational calculation using a dvr or lm derivatives delivers very precise values for the total energy in spite of the individual matrix elements being much less accurate . in what follows",
    ", we will illustrate that this property implies very accurate total energies while separate terms of the skyrme edf are less well represented .",
    "in addition , we will show that using a lm results in a variational calculation .",
    "unless explicitly stated , we have used the sly4 parameterization . to explore the dependence of the numerical accuracy on the edf ,",
    "we have in addition tested a representative set of skyrme parameterizations , as listed in appendix  [ app : forces ] .    in the next two sections , we present calculations for doubly - magic spherical nuclei @xmath75ca , @xmath76sn and @xmath77pb , the neutron - rich nucleus @xmath0ne , cd , sn and te isotope chains and the fission path of @xmath1pu .",
    "it is worth noting that we only included pairing for the isotopic chains and for @xmath1pu , see appendix  [ app : pairing ] for details . in all other cases ,",
    "pairing has been neglected .    in appendix",

    "the accuracy of a coordinate space calculation is limited by the size of the box , the discretization length @xmath40 and the way derivatives and integrals are calculated . in order to properly judge these effects we employ two ways of analyzing results . for spherical nuclei we can compare our 3d results with a one - dimensional spherical code that also represents the single - particle wave functions in coordinate space .",

    "<S> background : :    mean - field methods based on an energy density functional ( edf ) are    powerful tools used to describe many properties of nuclei in the    entirety of the nuclear chart . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy required on energies for    nuclear physics and astrophysics applications is of the order of    500  kev and much effort is undertaken to build edfs that meet this    requirement . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    the mean - field calculations have to be accurate enough in order to    preserve the accuracy of the edf . </S>",
    "<S> we study this numerical accuracy in    detail for a specific numerical choice of representation for the    mean - field equations that can accommodate any kind of symmetry    breaking . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    the method that we use is a particular implementation of 3-dimensional    mesh calculations . its numerical accuracy is governed by three main    factors : the size of the box in which the nucleus is confined , the way    numerical derivatives are calculated and the distance between the    points on the mesh . results : :    we have examined the dependence of the results on these three factors    for spherical doubly - magic nuclei , neutron - rich @xmath0 ,    the fission barrier of @xmath1 and isotopic chains around    @xmath2 . conclusions : :    mesh calculations offer the user extensive control over the numerical    accuracy of the solution scheme . by making appropriate choices for the    numerical scheme </S>",
    "<S> the achievable accuracy is well below the model    uncertainties of mean - field methods . </S>"
