    "the hercules supercluster is a close grouping of three rich abell clusters at a redshift @xmath1 . while the richness class  2 cluster abell@xmath22151 ( the classical `` hercules cluster '' ) dominates from the standpoint of the number of galaxies , the richness  1 cluster abell@xmath22152 is nearest to the center of the grouping .",
    "the third supercluster member is abell@xmath22147 .",
    "all three clusters are projected within a radius of only @xmath31@xmath4 ( @xmath52@xmath6mpc ) and have velocity dispersions of 700 to 800  ( barmby & huchra 1998 ) .    we have found that the cluster catalogued as abell 2152 is actually the chance alignment of two galaxy clusters : a2152 proper at @xmath7 , and a more massive background cluster at @xmath8 which we designate a2152-b .",
    "the centers of these two clusters are separated by just 24 , corresponding to 84 @xmath9kpc at @xmath10 .",
    "our analysis of ground - based imaging and spectroscopic data presented below indicates that the foreground cluster is strongly lensing at least one , and likely two , members of the background cluster .",
    "the magnitude @xmath11 object labeled ` a ' in figure  1 is projected 25  north of the a2152 cd galaxy but lies in the background at redshift @xmath12 ( blakeslee  2001 ) .",
    "the data were obtained at keck observatory using the lris ( oke  1995 ) .",
    "the curved shape , redshift , and orientation of the object all suggest gravitational lensing .",
    "such instances of low-@xmath13 cluster lensing in principle allow for higher resolution studies of the core mass profile ( e.g. , campusano  1998 ; blakeslee & metzger 1999 ) . however , our detailed modeling of this @xmath10 lensing system required the dominant potential well to be centered on the a2152 cd , rather than on the peak of the x - ray emission , which is positioned 21 to the east ( jones & forman 1999 ) . because of this",
    ", we suggested that there was a massive background cluster surrounding a pair of bright @xmath14 early - type galaxies , one of which is located just 20  from the reported x - ray center .",
    "recent ground - based @xmath15-band data confirm the existence of a rich background cluster , which we call a2152-b .",
    "the `` new '' cluster shows a well - defined early - type galaxy locus in the color - magnitude diagram of figure  2 .",
    "the colors are consistent with the @xmath16 redshift of a2152-b cd galaxy pair .",
    "this supports our strong lensing analysis of object  ` a ' :   the a2152 potential is indeed centered on its cd , but the x - ray center is offset because of background cluster emission .",
    "lensed galaxy ` a ' itself may well be a high - velocity member of a2152-b .",
    "another possibly strongly lensed _",
    "feature ( ` r ' in figure",
    "1 ) just 11  from the a2152  cd may also be in a2152-b , although its @xmath17 redshift is based on a single line , and therefore unconfirmed .",
    "the a2152/a2152-b system appears to be the first known instance of cluster - cluster lensing .",
    "in addition , our images reveal a faint blue arc near one of the pair of _ background _ cd galaxies , the one labeled `` cd@xmath21 '' in figure  1 .",
    "the arc candidate is indicated in figure  3 .",
    "if this is a yet more distant source being lensed by the background cluster , then this would make a2152-b a _ lensed lens_. additional arc candidates can be found near the background cd pair but can not be verified with our current ground - based data .",
    "= 9.8 cm    = 9.3 cm",
    "because gravitational lensing measures only the total projected mass along a line of sight , cluster masses will be overestimated _ whenever _ there are superposed galaxy groups , sheets , or filaments .",
    "this is a particularly severe problem for optically selected clusters , such as abell clusters .",
    "projection of multiple mass components now appears to explain some of the discrepancies between lensing and x - ray / dynamical masses in several intermediate redshift clusters , including cl0024 + 1654 ( soucail  2000 ; czoske  2001 ) and rx j0848 + 4456 ( holden  2001 ) . abell@xmath22152 offers a unique opportunity to study and disentangle a complex , overlapping cluster mass system at close  range .",
    "one benefit of cluster - cluster lensing is the large population of background galaxies at a known redshift . knowing the redshift of the source population removes a significant contribution to the uncertainty in weak lensing reconstructions of the mass profile .",
    "of course , the addition of weak lensing information for yet more distant sources by both clusters then helps in constraining the background cluster mass profile as well .",
    "even more exciting is the opportunity to measure the fundamental plane in a lensed cluster . of the lensing , the early - type galaxy population in a2152-b should lie `` above '' the unlensed fundamental plane , i.e. , have effective radii and luminosities too large for their velocity the magnitude and spatial gradient of the offset will provide a direct measure of the _ absolute _ mass profile of a2152 .",
    "we have recently obtained good quality keck lris multi - slit spectroscopy for about 100 galaxies in the central a2152/a2152-b field . when completed",
    ", this will be the first measurement of gravitational magnification of a known standard candle or standard rod .",
    "mass estimates from magnification are unaffected by the notorious `` mass - sheet degeneracy '' which afflicts all estimates based solely on image shear .",
    "the combination of magnification and shear measurements at the same projected radii should greatly enhance our understanding of the mass structure in this complex nearby cluster lensing system ."
