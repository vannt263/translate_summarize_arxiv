    "it is well known that there exist several factors which will affect the accuracy of estimation about the plasma frequency via integration .",

    ", we emphasize that our motivation to use drude - lorentz model to decompose the real part of optical conductivity is not to get a reasonable plasma frequency of these samples.we synthesize five selective samples and perform optical studies on them . by using a similar procedure to decompose the low - energy optical conductivity",
    ", we try to find out why the plasma frequency of iron pnictides can not be estimated correctly through drude - lorentz model and why the incoherent drude term is always present in the optical conductivity of iron pnictides .",
    "earlier optical investigation reveals that decomposition of the low - energy optical conductivity into two drude terms , a narrow one and a broad one , is a universal behavior in iron pnictides.@xcite the broad drude term has a long high - energy tail , indicative of its incoherent feature .",
