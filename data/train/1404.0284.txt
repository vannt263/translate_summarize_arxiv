    "prudent management of electricity consumption is becoming increasingly important . yet studies on residential energy users show that the vast majority are poor at estimating their whole - house energy consumption or the energy consumption of individual devices@xcite .",
    "residents often underestimate the energy used by heating and overestimate the consumption of perceptually salient devices like lights and televisions@xcite .",
    "residents failure to correctly estimate energy consumption is likely to lead to higher total consumption .",
    "how significant is occupant behaviour in determining total energy usage ?",
    "energy use can differ by two or three times among identical houses with similar appliances occupied by people from similar demographics@xcite .",
    "these large differences in energy consumption are attributed to differences in consumption behaviour .",
    "if the house provided better feedback about which devices used the most energy then users could adjust their behaviour to make more efficient use of appliances .",
    "` smart electricity meters ' are one such feedback mechanism .",
    "the uk government requires that energy retailers install smart electricity and gas meters by 2020 .",
    "the roll - out is already underway@xcite .",
    "similar smart meter roll - outs are planned in many countries .",
    "the business case for smart meters in great britain@xcite assumes that smart meters will drive savings of  4.6  billion due to reduced energy consumption ( across both electricity and gas ) .",
    "smart meters only provide energy consumption measurements for the entire house yet behavioural research suggests that consumers are best able to manage their electricity consumption when given _ appliance - by - appliance _",
    "information @xcite .",
    "energy disaggregation aims to estimate appliance - by - appliance consumption from a smart meter signal and hence may play an important role in realising the energy savings projected by the smart meter business case .",
    "energy disaggregation@xcite is an active area of research ( see armel _",
    "2013@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "researchers require access to large datasets recorded in the field to develop disaggregation algorithms but it is not practical for every researcher to record their own dataset .",
    "hence the creation of open access datasets is key to promote a vibrant research community .",
    "researchers at mit led the way by releasing the reference energy disaggregation data set ( redd ) in 2011@xcite and more datasets have subsequently been released by researchers in the usa@xcite , canada@xcite , india@xcite , france@xcite , the uk@xcite , switzerland@xcite , portugal@xcite and italy and austria@xcite .    to test the performance of a disaggregation algorithm for a specific country , it is important to have access to data from that country because electricity usage varies significantly between countries ; both because different countries use different sets of appliances and also because different cultures show different usage patterns .    at the time of writing ,",
    "the only open - access dataset recorded in the uk is the decc / defra household electricity study@xcite which has a sample period of two minutes . yet",
    "this sample rate is 12 times slower than uk smart meters which will sample every 10  seconds@xcite .",
    "it is this smart meter data which will provide the input to disaggregation algorithms so researchers require access to 10  second data to design disaggregation algorithms for the uk ( some other countries will also use smart meters with similar sample periods ) .",
    "we present the first open access uk dataset with a high temporal resolution .",
    "we recorded from five houses .",
    "every six  seconds we recorded the active power drawn by individual appliances and the whole - house apparent power demand . additionally , in three houses , we sampled the whole - house voltage and current at 44.1  khz ( down - sampled to 16  khz for storage ) and also calculated the active power , apparent power and rms voltage at 1  hz . in house  1 , we recorded for 655  days and individually recorded from almost every single appliance in the house resulting in a recording of 54 separate channels ( although less channels were recorded towards the start of the dataset ) .",
    "we will continue to record from this house for the foreseeable future .",
    "we recorded from the four other houses for several months ; each of these houses recorded between 5 to 26  channels of individual appliance data .",
    "figure  [ fig : system_diagram ] provides an overview of the system design and table  [ table : houses ] summarises the dataset .",
    "this dataset may also be of use to researchers working on :    * modelling the electricity grid . * exploring the potential for automated demand response . * appliance usage behaviour .",
    "desirable attributes of a dataset for disaggregation include :    * simultaneously record the power drawn by most of the individual appliances in each house ( this data can be used to validate the appliance - by - appliance estimates produced by a disaggregation system or to train the system ) . *",
    "record the whole - house active power ( this will be the input to the disaggregation algorithm ) . *",
    "sample once every 10  seconds or faster .",
    "* record for as long as possible .",
    "we first describe our approach to monitoring individual appliances once every 6  seconds and then describe how we recorded whole - house mains power at 44.1  khz .",
    "01_system_diagram.eps     in uk houses such as those in our dataset , mains ` rings ' extend from the fuse box .",
    "many sockets may share the same ring .",
    "hence , in order to measure individual appliances in the uk , we must install plug - in individual appliance monitors ( iams ) between each appliance and its wall socket .",
    "we used ecomanager transmitter plugs@xcite developed by current cost and distributed by edf energy .",
    "the standard base station for these iams is the ecomanager@xcite .",
    "the ecomanager can only handle a maximum of 14 transmitter plugs and only provides data once per minute via its serial port .",
    "we needed up to 54 appliances monitored per house and data every 10  seconds or faster . to achieve this , we set about building our own base station . with the help of others in the community ( see acknowledgements ) , we reconstructed the specification of the ecomanager protocol .    with the reconstructed protocol in hand , we built our own base station by programming an open - source , rapid - development platform called the nanode@xcite .",
    "the nanode includes an atmel atmega328p microcontroller running at 16  mhz ( the same microcontroller used on several arduinos ) and a hoperf rfm12b@xcite radio frequency ( rf ) module .",
    "the ecomanager products appear to use the same ( or similar ) rf module tuned to the 433  mhz ism band ( note that , in some countries , it is illegal to use the 433  mhz band without a license ) .",
    "we found the appropriate starting point for our rf configuration settings by using a bus pirate@xcite to sniff configuration packets from the serial peripheral interface ( spi ) connecting the ecomanager s microcontroller to its rf module .",
    "each iam picks its own 32-bit i d at random when the iam s ` pair ' button is pressed .",
    "each iam stores its i d in non - volatile memory .",
    "our base station maintains a list of these ids and polls each iam in order .",
    "each iam replies to its polling packet within 20  ms , although the power data in this packet may be a few seconds old .",
    "the ecomanager rf protocol uses a modular sum checksum byte to provide some resilience against rf corruption .",
    "power data is sent from our nanode base station to a data logging pc over an ftdi - to - usb cable .",
    "it is also possible to turn iams on or off remotely .    to measure power from hard - wired appliances such as boilers and kitchen ceiling lights , we used current cost transmitters@xcite ( tx ) with current transformer ( ct ) clamps .",
    "these transmitters use the same radio frequency as the edf iams but a different protocol .",
    "in particular , the current cost transmitters can not _ receive _ rf data .",
    "instead they transmit a data packet once every @xmath1  seconds without first checking if the rf channel is clear",
    ". hence rf collisions are inevitable and there is no mechanism to request re - transmission of lost data . as such , our base station minimises the chance of packet collisions by learning the transmit period of each current cost tx and ensuring that the base station does not transmit for a short window of time prior to the expected arrival of a current cost tx packet .",
    "current cost transmitters do not use a checksum .",
    "instead they use manchester encoding .",
    "rf corruption may result in an invalid manchester code .",
    "if this happens then the receiver can detect the corrupt manchester code and discard the packet .",
    "unfortunately , it is possible for corruption to damage the data payload without invalidating the manchester encoding and so corrupt packets are not guaranteed to be detected from current cost transmitters .    to maximise the distance over which we can transmit , we experimented with several antenna and rf module configurations .",
    "we settled on a @xmath2-wavelength antenna combined with a ground plane composed of four @xmath2-wavelength wires in a cross shape running in the plane of the ground , originating from just below the point at which the antenna connects to the nanode s printed circuit board .",
    "given that there will be a flood of smart meter data in the near future , disaggregation researchers need access to data which is as similar as possible to the data that will be recorded by smart meters in the near future .",
    "unfortunately , ` real ' smart meters are not trivial to install or to acquire : installation requires an electrician from the utility company and , critically , the current uk smart meter engineering specifications have not yet been finalised ( the smets2 document@xcite is not an engineering specification ) .",
    "british gas have installed over a million ` real ' smart meters but these meters do not comply with smets2 and none of our participants had such a meter installed .",
    "so we had to build our own measurement system .",
    "the current iteration of the uk smart meter specification @xcite is detailed enough to allow us to build our own metering system which closely mimics what a uk smart meter is likely to provide ( these specifications are subject to formal change control processes such that any changes are subject to analysis and stakeholder approval ) .",
    "the latest specifications@xcite state that smart meters are required to connect to the home area network ( han ) using zigbee smart energy protocol v1 . presumably , a disaggregation system would access smart meter data by way of a ` consumer access device ' ( cad ) connected to the han .",
    "cads can request instantaneous active power and pricing data from the smart electricity meter once every 10  seconds .",
    "additionally , cads will be able to pull other data such as 13  months of half hourly active import data , 3  months of half hourly reactive import data and 3  months of half hourly active and reactive export data ",
    "[ smets2@xcite and personal communication with decc , october 2013 ] .",
    "we set out to build a metering system that would collect active power once a second , as well as to sample the voltage and current waveforms at 44.1  khz to allow researchers who are interested in this high frequency data to use it .",
    "one solution was to use an off - the - shelf current cost whole - house transmitter with a current transformer ( ct ) clamp .",
    "these work with our wireless base station .",
    "we used this solution in several houses where our bespoke solution was impractical .",
    "there are several disadvantages to using a ct clamp connected to a wireless transmitter :    * ct clamps measure current ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the transmitter usually has no way to measure voltage and so must use a hard - coded value for voltage ( @xmath4 ) to calculate a power reading ( @xmath5 ) using @xmath6 .",
    "however , mains voltage in the uk is allowed to vary by ( sometimes quite abruptly ) so power readings for a linear resistive load can vary by ( as noted by hart@xcite ) .",
    "these abrupt changes due to external noise are problematic for disaggregation algorithms because disaggregation algorithms tend to rely on _ changes _ in power demand to detect appliance state changes . however , not all appliances are affected by voltage variations .",
    "the power demand for ` constant power ' devices remains constant across the legal voltage range . *",
    "battery powered transmitters tend to sparsely sample from their ct clamp in order to minimise battery usage . hence rapid changes may be missed . * without instantaneous measurements of both voltage and current , it is not possible to measure active power or reactive power .",
    "hence ct clamps without voltage measurements can only estimate apparent power . *",
    "the openenergymonitor emontx@xcite is unaffected by all three disadvantages mentioned above .",
    "however , the version of the emontx available in 2012 when we designed our system used an analogue to digital converter with only 10  bits of resolution .",
    "if we want to measure a primary current which varies from , say , 0 to 30  amps then the emontx can only resolve changes larger than 14  watts .",
    "( the emontx uses 10  bits of resolution to capture both the positive and negative sides of the ac signal so in effect it uses only 9  bits to cover a 30  amp range .",
    "@xmath7 per adc step so it can resolve changes in current larger than or equal to @xmath8 . and @xmath9 ) . ` real ' smart meters will almost certainly have considerably higher resolution so , unfortunately , the emontx available in 2012 when we were designing our system was not a suitable proxy for a ` real ' smart meter .",
    "no existing home energy monitor that we were aware of provided an accurate proxy for uk smart meters .",
    "expensive power quality monitors costing several hundred or thousand uk pounds can measure with the accuracy we require but these are prohibitively expensive and some require ct sensors _ without _ a split core , hence requiring the installer to disconnect the meter tails from the utility company s meter , which can only be done with permission from the utility company .",
    "we propose a low - cost , high resolution , easy to install technique for recording whole - house mains power demand using a computer sound card , a ct clamp and an ac - ac adapter .",
    "typical sound cards have remarkably good analogue to digital converters ( adcs ) . typical specifications of a modern sound card include :    * 96  khz sample rate . * simultaneous recording of at least 2 channels . * 90  db signal to noise . * 20  bits per sample . given that each bit provides 6 db of dynamic range",
    ", we effectively have @xmath10 bits of ` signal ' and @xmath11 bits of ` noise ' per sample . *",
    "built - in high - pass filter .",
    "* built - in anti - alias filter .    to record mains voltage and current waveforms we require a simple circuit to connect the sound card to an ac - ac adapter and a ct clamp ( figure  [ fig : system_diagram ] ) .",
    "this circuit does not require the user to handle any hazardous voltages .",
    "we used the line - input of the sound card rather than the microphone input because the line - input should provide a lower noise signal path than the sound card s microphone pre - amplifier .",
    "the standard maximum peak - to - peak voltage for consumer audio equipment line - input is 0.89  volts .",
    "hence the aim of our circuit must be to reduce the output voltage of each sensor so that we never deliver more than 0.89  volts to the sound card .    to measure mains voltage as safely as possible , we used a standard ac - ac adapter ( the ` ideal power 77db-06 - 09 ' ) .",
    "this provides a peak open - circuit output voltage of approximately 11 volts .",
    "research done by the open energy monitor project@xcite suggests that the output of the ac - ac adapter should track the mains input voltage linearly over the range 185.5  v to 253  v. we reduced the ac - ac adapter s output voltage with a voltage divider circuit ( we used two resistors : 10  k  and 220  ) to produce about 0.7 v peak - to - peak which is fed into one channel of the sound card s line input .    to measure mains current , we used a current transformer ( ct ) clamp ( the ` yhdc sct-013 - 000 ' ) .",
    "both the ct clamp and ac - ac adapter were sourced from the open energy monitor shop@xcite .",
    "the ct is connected in parallel to a 22  burden resistor .",
    "this configuration produces about 0.89  v peak - to - peak across the burden resistor when the ct is presented with a primary current of 30 amps rms which , we believe , is the most current that any of the houses under study will pull .    to protect the sound card against overload , both channels include an 80 ma quick - blow fuse and a pair of 1n5282 diodes ( with a 1.3 v forward voltage bias ) to ensure that the circuit is unlikely to ever deliver more than 1.3 v to the sound card .",
    "let us calculate a rough estimate for our measurement resolution .",
    "if we want to measure a primary current with a range of 0 to @xmath12 then we should be able to resolve changes in primary current of approximately per sample ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) . for the voltage measurement",
    ", if we want a range of 0 to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) then we should be able to resolve changes of approximately per sample ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . given that the sensors are likely to be noisy and given that we are only providing @xmath19 to the adc for the voltage measurements , we should downgrade our resolution per sample to about and for voltage and current respectively .",
    "this gives us a resolution for power of approximately @xmath20 .",
    "we now describe the software for our sound card power meter .",
    "we use the following relations to calculate @xmath21 ( apparent power ) and @xmath5 ( ` real ' or ` active ' power ) from simultaneously recorded vectors of voltage and current readings ( we record in chunks each with a duration of 1  second ; this time period was chosen because redd uses this sample period for mains data ) :    @xmath22    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the root mean squared values for the current and voltage vectors respectively ; @xmath26 is the number of samples ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath29 samples of the current and voltage vectors respectively .",
    "the system does not guarantee that we always process chunks of length equal to precise integer multiples of the mains cycle period but , as demonstrated in the section , we still achieve relative errors consistently less than 2% .",
    "the conclusion is that we achieve a resolution greater than that required to provide a good proxy for ` real ' smart meters ( although we acknowledge that we do not know the precise resolution of ` real ' smart meters .",
    "this decision is likely to be left to the manufacturers [ personal communication with decc , march 2013 ] ) .",
    "we save @xmath5 , @xmath21 and @xmath30 to disk once a second with a precision of 2 decimal places in a csv file .",
    "we also save the raw adc data to disk . to reduce the space required , the adc data are down - sampled using the open - source audio tool ` sox`@xcite to 16  khz ( redd used 15  khz and we originally wanted to use the standard defined by redd but we found that support for 16  khz is more common than for 15  khz in processing tools ) .",
    "the adc is 20-bit but few audio processing tools can process 20-bit files so we pad each sample to produce a 24-bit file .",
    "the uncompressed 16  khz 24-bit files would require 28.8  gbytes per day so we compress the files using the free lossless audio codec ( flac)@xcite to reduce the storage requirements to @xmath31  gbytes per day .      to convert the raw adc values to voltage and current readings",
    ", we must first find appropriate conversion constants .",
    "we calibrate each data collection system separately to compensate for manufacturing variability in the components .",
    "we calibrate each system once when it is first setup .",
    "we connect a ` watts up ?",
    "pro meter@xcite ' to the data logging pc via usb during setup to automatically calibrate voltage and current conversion factors .",
    "we typically use a resistive load like a kettle to calibrate the system . if the ` watts up ? ' meter reports a power factor greater than 0.97 then the calibration script also calibrates the phase shift introduced by the sensors .",

    "rfm_ecomanager_logger attempts to restart the nanode if the nanode    crashes .",

    "the sound card power meter was calibrated six months prior to the test .",

    "we compared the total active energy recorded by our sound card power meter for house  1 with the utility - installed ` spinning disk ' electricity meter in house  1 .",
    "we selected the time period of 2014 - 11 - 28 08:55 to 2013 - 05 - 22 20:36 for the comparison because we have a continuous recording from our sound card power meter for this period , and we have readings of the utility meter at the start and end of this period .",

    "there are several aspects of the dataset that might need to be addressed using appropriate pre - processing :    data packets from the wireless meters are occasionally lost in transmission .",
    "around 6% of packets are lost from the current transformer sensors and around 0.02% of packets are lost from individual appliance monitor plugs .",
    "the sample period for the 6 second data may drift up or down by a second .    some individual appliance monitors are switched off ( and hence do not transmit any data ) when the appliance is switched off from the mains .",
    "we switch them off to reduce the risk of an electrical fault causing a fire , and to save energy .",
    "some appliances are unplugged for the majority of the time .",
    "for example , the vacuum cleaner is physically unplugged from the wall socket when not in use and the vacuum cleaner s meter is left attached to the cleaner s power plug ( and hence is not powered ) . as a rule of thumb",
    ", any gap in the data longer than two minutes can be assumed to be caused by the appliance ( and monitor ) being switched off from the mains .",
    "hence gaps longer than two minutes can safely be filled with zeros .",
    "the threshold of two minutes was chosen because we observed gaps less than two minutes caused by a succession of radio transmission errors .",
    "any gap shorter than two minutes can be forward - filled from the previous reading .",
    "some appliances draw more than @xmath44  watts when nominally ` off ' .",
    "we typically use 5  watts as the threshold between ` on ' and ` off ' .",
