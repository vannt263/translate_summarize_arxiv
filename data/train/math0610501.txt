    "the study of embeddings of graphs in @xmath2 is a natural extension of knot theory .",
    "however , in contrast with knots whose properties depend only on their extrinsic topology , there is a rich interplay between the intrinsic structure of a graph and the extrinsic topology of all embeddings of the graph in @xmath2 .",
    "conway and gordon @xcite obtained groundbreaking results of this nature by showing that every embedding of the complete graph @xmath10 in @xmath2 contains a non - trivial link and every embedding of @xmath11 in @xmath2 contains a non - trivial knot . because this type of linking and knotting is intrinsic to the graph itself rather than depending on the particular embedding of the graph in @xmath2 , @xmath10 is said to be _ intrinsically linked _ and @xmath11 is said to be _ intrinsically knotted_. on the other hand , conway and gordon @xcite illustrated an embedding of @xmath12 such that the only non - trivial link @xmath13 contained in @xmath12 is the hopf link ( which has @xmath14 ) ; and they illustrated an embedding of @xmath15 such that the only non - trivial knot @xmath16 contained in @xmath15 is the trefoil knot ( which has @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the second coefficient of the conway polynomial of @xmath16 ) . in this sense",
    ", we see that @xmath12 exhibits the simplest type of intrinsic linking and @xmath15 exhibits the simplest type of intrinsic knotting .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that for sufficiently large values of @xmath19 , the complete graph @xmath20 exhibits more complex types of intrinsic linking and knotting .",
    "in particular , flapan @xcite showed that for every @xmath21 , there is a complete graph @xmath22 such that every embedding of @xmath20 in @xmath23 contains both a 2-component oriented link @xmath24 whose linking number is at least @xmath25 and a knot @xmath16 with @xmath26 ( though @xmath24 and @xmath16 have no particular relationship ) .",
    "fleming @xcite shows that for any @xmath27 , there is a graph @xmath28 such that every embedding of @xmath28 in @xmath2 contains a non - split link of @xmath29 components where @xmath0 of the components are non - trivial knots . in the current paper",
    ", we show that for sufficiently large complete graphs intrinsic linking with knotted components is arbitrarily complex both in terms of linking number and in terms of the knotting of every component . in particular , our main result is the following .",
    "[ main thm ] for every @xmath0 , @xmath30 , there is a complete graph @xmath22 such that every embedding of @xmath22 in @xmath2 contains an oriented link with components @xmath3 , ",
    ", @xmath4 such that for every @xmath31 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if linking is measured with linking number and knotting is measured with @xmath32 , then this is the strongest result one could hope for about the complexity of simultaneous intrinsic knotting and linking .",
    "furthermore , observe that for a given @xmath33 , there are only finitely many knots whose minimal crossing number is less than or equal to @xmath34 .",
    "if we pick @xmath25 larger than the @xmath35 of all of the knots with minimal crossing number less than or equal to @xmath34 , then the knots @xmath3 ,  , @xmath4 given by theorem [ main thm ] will each have minimal crossing number greater than @xmath34 .",
    "it follows that the complexity of intrinsic knotting as measured by the crossing number can also be made arbitrarily large .    in order to prove our main result , we first prove in section 2 that intrinsic linking is arbitrarily complex in the sense of the structure of a link . in particular , we prove the following .    [",
    "t : complete ] for every @xmath0 , @xmath36 , there is a complete graph @xmath22 such that every embedding of @xmath22 in @xmath2 contains an oriented link with components @xmath3 , ",
    ", @xmath4 such that for every @xmath5 , @xmath37 .",
    "the idea of the proof of theorem [ main thm ] is then as follows .",
    "taniyama and yasuhara @xcite have shown that for any embedding of the pseudo - graph @xmath38 ( see figure [ collapsed4 ] ) , the product of the linking numbers of the two opposite pairs of cycles , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , is related to the sum of the @xmath32 s of all of the hamiltonian cycles @xmath16 according to the formula :    @xmath41    we use theorem [ t : complete ] to find a complete graph @xmath22 , so that every embedding of @xmath22 contains a link with a `` large enough '' number of components all pairwise linked with linking number at least @xmath25 .",
    "we then use a recursive argument to successively exchange opposite pairs of linked cycles in a @xmath38 ( which is a minor of @xmath22 ) for a knotted hamiltonian cycle in @xmath38 which is linked with all of the previous knotted cycles in the construction .",
    "we do this in such a way that for all of the knotted cycles @xmath9 and @xmath42 we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we wish to thank alan tarr for suggesting that we represent the structure of a link with a linking pattern , for reading a preliminary draft of this paper , and for suggesting that we prove the current version of theorem [ t : complete ] .",
    "we also want to thank kouki taniyama for asking us whether the conclusion of theorem 1 could be strengthened by removing the absolute value on the linking number .",
    "the current version of proposition [ p : nostrong ] , together with corollary [ c:3link ] , and proposition [ p : ramsey ] grew out of our response to taniyama s question .",
    "we will use a weighted graph to describe the structure of a link as follows .    given an oriented link @xmath24 with components @xmath45 , ",
    ", @xmath46 , the _ linking pattern _ of @xmath24 is the graph with vertices @xmath47 ,  , @xmath48 , such that there is an edge between @xmath49 and @xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 . the _ weighted linking pattern _ of @xmath24 is the linking pattern with a _ weight _ assigned to each edge @xmath52 representing the value of @xmath53 .",
    "for example , the linking pattern of a hopf link is a single edge . as another example , consider a _ keyring _ link .",
    "that is , a link consisting of a _ ring _ , @xmath54 , and _",
    "keys _ , @xmath45 ,  , @xmath46 , such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 for all @xmath5 .",
    "the linking pattern of a keyring link is an @xmath0-star ( i.e. , a graph consisting of @xmath0 vertices all connected to a single additional vertex ) .",
    "many results about intrinsic linking use the mod 2 linking number , @xmath57 as a simpler measure of linking than the ordinary linking number .",
    "thus we will also use the following definition .    given a link @xmath24 with components @xmath45 , ",
    ", @xmath46 , the _ mod 2 linking pattern _ of @xmath24 is the graph with vertices @xmath47 ,  , @xmath48 , such that there is an edge between @xmath49 and @xmath50 if and only if @xmath58 .",
    "using this terminology , conway and gordon @xcite and sachs @xcite showed that every embedding of @xmath10 in @xmath2 contains a link whose mod 2 linking pattern is a single edge .",
    "fleming and diesl @xcite showed that there is a graph @xmath28 such that every embedding of @xmath28 in @xmath2 contains a link @xmath59 where @xmath60 for each @xmath61 .",
    "thus every embedding of @xmath28 in @xmath2 contains a link whose mod 2 linking pattern contains an @xmath0-star , possibly with additional edges .",
    "we call such a link a _ generalized keyring _ link , since some of the @xmath62 s may be linked with one another .",
    "prior to this paper , a chain of @xmath0 edges and a circle of @xmath0 edges @xcite , and an @xmath0-star @xcite were the only linking patterns @xmath63 which were known to have the property that for some graph @xmath28 every embedding of @xmath28 in @xmath2 contains a link whose linking pattern contains @xmath63 .",
    "we prove in theorem [ t : complete ] that for every complete graph @xmath64 , there is a graph @xmath28 such that every embedding of @xmath28 in @xmath2 contains a link whose linking pattern is @xmath64 .",
    "it follows that for any linking pattern @xmath63 , there is a graph @xmath28 such that every embedding of @xmath28 in @xmath2 contains a link whose linking pattern contains @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , using the language of linking patterns we prove the following restatement of theorem [ t : complete ] .",

    "furthermore , in proposition [ p : nostrong ] we show that complete graphs are the only linking patterns that have the property described by theorem [ t : complete ] .",
    "in other words , complete graphs can be said to be the only _ intrinsic _ linking patterns .",

    "we will use this result to prove theorem [ t : complete ] .",
    "in fact , in proposition [ t : bipartite ] , we prove the stronger result that we can ensure that all of the weights are odd .",
    "it is an open question whether this stronger formulation can be extended to the linking pattern @xmath64 .    in order to prove proposition [ t : bipartite ] , we need the following lemma which allows us to combine many pairs of linked cycles into a single cycle that links some proportion of the original components . throughout the paper we use the term _",
