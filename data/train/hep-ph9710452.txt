    "in theories with spontaneous breaking of global symmetries the theorem asserts the existence of massless particles - the bosons - one per each non - zero quantum number of the vacuum . in principle",
    "such massless scalar bosons could mediate long range forces and lead to observable coherence effects just like the gravitational force .",
    "however , the very structure imposed by exact global symmetries at the lagrangian level implies that these goldstons have nothing but derivative couplings with matter fields .",
    "it was shown that if the symmetry constraints are relaxed either through anomalies or with soft symmetry breaking terms then , scalar couplings of pseudo - goldstons with fermions naturally arise .",
    "consequently , macroscopic forces are developed by matter aggregates but one price is paid : the intermediate bosons get non - zero masses which means that the range of those forces is finite . in this paper",
    "it is shown that under special conditions a true boson may develop a macroscopic field , the source being the rate of non - conservation of the matter quantum number associated with that field",
    ". that may be significant in astrophysical compact objects and the case of supernovae is analysed .    to be definite i consider an abelian global symmetry @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes generically any linear combination of flavour lepton numbers such as @xmath4 or the total lepton number @xmath5 . after symmetry breaking non - invariant terms are generated in masses and/or couplings but the symmetry is still realized non - linearly and strongly constrains the couplings to the  boson @xmath6",
    ". under @xmath2 ,",
    "the matter fields and @xmath6 transform as    [ trfs ] @xmath7 [ tpsi ] @xmath8    respectively , where @xmath9 is the scale of symmetry breaking .",
    "consider for instance the lepton masses .",
    "let @xmath10 denote all left - handed neutrino fields including the standard weak interacting partners @xmath11 and any extra neutral singlets .",
    "the mass terms generated either radiatively or at tree - level are necessarily accompanied by couplings to @xmath6 completely determined by the lepton charges @xmath12 : @xmath13 where a sum over @xmath14 and @xmath15 is assumed .",
    "moreover , in any other term of the lagrangian each field @xmath16 always comes with a factor @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , a spatially uniform @xmath6 would be absorbed in the mass eigenstate fields leaving no couplings with @xmath6 .",
    "matter only cares about the gradient of @xmath6 and that , as shown in @xcite , is better expressed in what i term as weak - unitary basis : @xmath18 the new fields preserve the original quantum number assignments but are invariant under the global symmetry transformations ( [ trfs ] ) .",
    "they reduce now to a translational invariance @xmath19 and therefore , the goldston interactions can only depend on the @xmath6 derivatives .    in the unitary basis",
    "the effective lagrangian writes as @xmath20 all of the goldston interactions are condensated in the current @xmath21 which includes the matter current derived from the kinetic lagrangian of @xmath22 but also in general model dependent higher order corrections .",
    "the @xmath6 equation of motion reads @xmath23 and clearly the source term is not some sort of matter density .",
    "the divergences of @xmath24 and @xmath25 only yield pseudo - scalar @xmath26 charges that do not generate long range @xmath27 fields , but rather spin dependent @xmath28 potentials @xcite . in the intent of escaping the derivative couplings law ,",
    "models were made with explicit symmetry breaking terms .",
    "these may be anomaly terms @xcite , as in the axion case @xcite , or soft symmetry breaking terms @xcite . in this way",
    "scalar couplings with the goldston field are produced but at the cost of getting a mass for the so - called pseudo nambu - goldstone boson which ultimately means a finite range for the long range forces .",
    "here , i will explore the fact that the source term is different from zero whenever the @xmath3 number of the matter particles is not conserved . to be accurate , there is a nother current associated to the symmetry @xmath29 namely @xmath30 , that is exactly _ conserved _ , but the non - standard interactions do not conserve the fermions @xmath3 number as a result of the very spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "non - conservation of @xmath31 may occur in macroscopic proportions in a stationary basis in stars , or in supernovae for a short period of time .",
    "for instance , the total lepton number is violated at a constant rate in the process of neutrino emission of a star if @xmath32 has a majorana mass : the non - conservation takes place in the neutrino production reaction where a fraction of the neutrino wave function is an anti - neutrino @xmath33 .",
    "this fraction is of course suppressed by the ratio @xmath34 .",
    "that is not the case if a significant portion of the @xmath32 spectrum is converted into @xmath35 anti - neutrinos under appropriate magnetic field and transition magnetic moments .",
    "another example is a  boson associated with the breaking of @xmath36 .",
    "if there is resonant conversion of @xmath32s into @xmath37s then the goldston source has macroscopic dimensions and a long - range scalar field is generated .",
    "the solution of the @xmath6 equation of motion is found using standard green function methods . in the source term",
    ", @xmath38 represents the rate of _ creation _ of @xmath3-charge per unity of time and volume . in a stationary regime where this rate is constant or",
    "varies slowly enough one gets a coulombian field @xmath39 where the bracket means expectation value of the operator @xmath31 over the appropriate particle state density .",
    "the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ luni ] ) tells however that the fermions couple to the gradient @xmath40 . in the stationary limit",
    "@xmath41 is negligible and the vector @xmath42 obeys a gauss law : @xmath43 it implies that the flux of @xmath44 over a closed surface is proportional to the time rate @xmath45 of _ creation _ of @xmath3-charge inside the surface . in turn",
    "@xmath46 is equal to the difference between the flux of @xmath47 and the flux of the current @xmath48 that would exist if there was no @xmath3 violation inside the surface .",
    "hence , @xmath49 the value of @xmath48 is determined for a given @xmath50 and obeys the identity @xmath51 .",
    "one reaches the same solution by noting that the nother current @xmath52 is conserved .",
    "a typical situation of potential interest is the flavour violation driven by  oscillations in their way out of a star .",
    "the quantum numbers are the partial lepton numbers @xmath53 or linear combinations of them and the bare currents are @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 , denote any non - standard neutrinos . to be specific suppose that @xmath57 is spontaneously broken .",
    "the  boson @xmath58 associated with it couples to a current @xmath59 that is essentially @xmath60 but contains in general higher order terms arising from radiative corrections .",
    "their existence implies that even if @xmath57 is conserved in a certain process , the very reaction rate , of particle production or absorption , is enough to yield a goldston field .",
    "however those terms are of higher order and i will limit myself to the bare tree - level currents .    for definiteness",
    "i assume that all non - standard  are extra - heavy singlet  that can not be produced at energies of interest and in addition , no significant  @xmath61 anti-  transitions occur either because the light  masses are too small or because transition magnetic moments do not come into play .",
    "suppose that in the way out of a star @xmath32s convert into @xmath62s and the flux of converted  is @xmath63 .",
    "then , a macroscopic goldston field @xmath58 exists with non - zero gradient outside the sphere where the conversion takes place . in the supernovae case one also gets a flux @xmath64 .",
    "( [ alv1 ] ) gives @xmath65 with @xmath66 if the conversion involves anti - neutrinos one has instead @xmath67 , because the antineutrinos have negative lepton numbers .",
    "the field @xmath58 yields a potential energy for the @xmath68 .",
    "generalising now to any quantum number @xmath69 and goldston field @xmath70 , the interaction lagrangian @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ luni ] ) gives for the standard  @xmath72 , @xmath73 the potential energy of a neutrino with velocity @xmath74 is therefore @xmath75 in the stationary limit @xmath76 and for radially moving neutrinos @xmath77 is just the radial component @xmath78 .",
    "the interesting point is that such kind of potential is not universal in flavour and in addition the sign of the potential is not solely determined by the matter content of the medium where neutrinos propagate as it also depends on the flavour structure of the  fluxes .",
    "this allows in principle other than the standard msw type of oscillations .",
    "the most interesting effect is probably the occurrence of @xmath79 in a situation where it would not normally occur , with a mass hierarchy @xmath80 . in the following i model such kind of phenomenon with application to supernovae .",
    "if a partial lepton number is spontaneously broken it is natural that the same happens for all the three flavours .",
    "let @xmath81 be the set of scalar fields , singlets of su(2)xu(1 ) , with quantum numbers @xmath82 under the symmetry group @xmath83 .",
    "i assume that the vacuum expectation values @xmath84 break all the lepton numbers producing 3 goldstone bosons . by expanding around the vacuum as @xmath85 , where the dots stand for the massive degrees of freedom , one obtains for the lagrangian of the  fields @xmath86 a sum over the quantum numbers @xmath87 is implicit .",
    "the matrix @xmath88 is in general non - diagonal , the sole condition being that some of the fields @xmath89 have simultaneously more than one quantum number different from zero .",
    "such mixing implies that the  bosons can mediate an action at a distance between two distinct currents as the equations of motion show : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the inverse matrix of @xmath92 .",
    "hence , in a stationary regime the vector field solutions are now @xmath93 instead of eq .",
    "( [ alv1 ] ) .",
    "the expression of the one - particle potential remains the same as in eq .",
    "( [ vnul ] ) because the interaction lagrangian is the same as before namely , @xmath94 .",
    "it is not the aim of this paper to construct specific models but as a proof of existence i present here a suitable adaptation of the abelian familon @xcite and seesaw majoron @xcite models .",
    "three neutral singlets @xmath95 join the standard lepton iso - doublets @xmath96 @xmath97 , the charged singlets @xmath98 and the higgs doublet @xmath99 .",

    "the matrix @xmath111 that enters in the goldston equations of motion , eq .",

    "@xmath112 much higher than the dirac masses @xmath113 , the  separate in heavy @xmath114 with mass matrix @xmath112 and very small mixing with the three light , @xmath115 , that acquire a majorana mass matrix @xmath116 .",
    "the magnitudes relevant for the subsequent application lie around @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , @xmath119 , very far from the original @xcite seesaw gut scales but not excluded from first principles .",
    "it is known that this type of singlet majoron or familons easily escape present astrophysical bounds on the couplings of nambu-  bosons . here ,",
    "they couple primarily to  with pseudo - scalar couplings @xmath120 which , for the specified range of  masses , are far below @xmath121 to play a role in supernova collapse dynamics @xcite , and even below the limit of @xmath122 to produce supernova cooling through singlet majoron emission @xcite . on the other hand , pseudo - scalar couplings to electrons , that could be responsible for energy loss in stars @xcite , only arise through radiative corrections and are so further suppressed .",
    "if the cause of the well known solar neutrino anomalies lies in flavour oscillations then one expects that the same phenomenum occurs with supernovae . in the accepted understanding of supernova type - ii",
    "all neutrino species including their anti - particles are emitted with similar importance after a first electron  burst . as a working frame",
    "i adopt here the common prejudice that the  mass eigenstates are in first approximation - but not exactly - @xmath123 , with the following mass hierarchy : @xmath124 . in their way",

    "it is then in principle possible to have msw resonant conversions from @xmath32 into @xmath62 and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "the anti - particle @xmath33 on the contrary , receives a negative potential @xmath129 and can not be _ resonantly _ converted into the other flavours , given the assumed mass hierarchy .    in a supernova the @xmath32 flux is larger than the @xmath62 flux and consequently more @xmath32 transform into @xmath62 than the reverse so making a net @xmath130 violation . as a result , the goldston fields @xmath131 develop as described above . applying eq .",
    "( [ alv2 ] ) with flux transfers @xmath132 one derives the vector potentials @xmath133 they vanish of course inside the sphere where @xmath134 takes place .",
    "the magnitude of the constants @xmath91 is directly given by the inverse square of the lepton symmetry breaking scale , but the flavour structure is quite arbitrary and is not directly related to the  masses as they also depend on the yukawa couplings .",
    "the matrix @xmath91 is only constrained to be symmetric and have positive eigenvalues as demands the goldston kinetic lagrangian .    an interesting case is the following hierarchy : @xmath135 @xmath136 .",
    "then , the vector @xmath137 is much smaller in magnitude than @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "far enough from the neutrinosphere and assuming spherical symmetry , the @xmath0 potentials are well approximated by @xmath140 ignoring the universal neutral current and gravitational potentials .",
    "the anti-  potentials are the symmetric of these .    in the following the numbers for the  fluxes",
    "are extrapolated from the supernovae  luminosities obtained in @xcite with a @xmath141 model and in the generic model of @xcite .",
    "the energy fluxes follow this pattern : @xmath142 have all the same luminosity say @xmath143 , and @xmath144 gets rapidly close to the @xmath145 luminosity after the initial @xmath32 burst ( instant @xmath146 ) . from then to the supernova explosion ( @xmath147 sec ) , the average value of @xmath148 is around @xmath149 and @xmath143 is about @xmath150 to @xmath151 of @xmath148 .",

    "the mass density @xmath171 behaves as @xmath172 with a constant @xmath173 , @xmath174 depending on the star @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath175 @xmath125 decays necessarily faster than the goldston potentials which being proportional to the @xmath0 fluxes inevitably overcome at large enough radii .",
    "that is a crucial point .",
    "the effective @xmath176 matrix @xcite relevant for @xmath177 oscillations is , up to a universal term , given by : @xmath178 an electron anti - neutrino is emitted with a negative potential @xmath179 and a resonance would not be possible because @xmath180 , @xmath181 , by assumption .",
    "but , if the constant @xmath182 is negative , @xmath35 gets a negative goldston potential @xmath183 and the resonance condition @xmath184 may be met . in the fig .",

    "its dashed line crosses the relative potential curve at two points : the first , @xmath192 , lies in the remarkably sharp transition from the @xmath193 dominated region to the goldston dominated one and very likely a non - adiabatic level crossing occurs there , @xmath144 continues @xmath144 and @xmath35 continues @xmath35 .",
    "in the second point , @xmath194 , the potential is smooth enough ( @xmath195 ) for adiabatic transitions . in general",
    ", the conversion probability is enhanced @xcite if @xmath196 is larger than the rate @xmath197 at the resonance position .",
    "this function is plotted with squares in the figure for @xmath198 .",
    "one can see that small mixing angle adiabatic conversions are possible for a wide range of  masses . using the resonance condition ( neglecting @xmath125 ) one gets a lower bound on the mixing angle , @xmath199 while the maximum value of the @xmath0 potential sets an upper limit to the square mass difference : @xmath200 where @xmath201 .",
    "the requirement of non - adiabatic crossing in the first sharp resonance puts an upper limit on @xmath202 .",
    "the slope of the potential on that point is equal ( up to a numeric factor between 1 and 1/2 ) to the slope on the second resonance times the ratio @xmath203 and therefore that is the size of the window of interesting @xmath204 values for a given @xmath205 .",
    "the net result is that for a wide range of parameters @xmath144 , @xmath35 undergo one level crossing with maximum probability @xmath206 @xcite plus one adiabatic resonance .",
    "their survival probabilities @xcite are therefore @xmath207 and not @xmath208 ( mixing with @xmath62 neglected ) .",
    "as far as @xmath32 , @xmath37 is concerned , the potentials and @xmath186 are symmetric to the anti - neutrino case .",
    "there is still one resonance position as in the standard model but now in the abrupt part of the potential .",
    "it results in a non - adiabatic crossing and the oscillation pattern is @xmath209 and @xmath210 , @xmath211 in contrast to the standard one @xcite , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , for the same mass mixing pattern .",
    "this does not change the observation predictions because @xmath37 , @xmath62 have the same energy spectrum .",
    "finally , the late @xmath1 oscillations alter the net flavour violation and modify the goldston fields out of the sphere where they take place but that does not create new resonances .",
    "this all picture may relate to solar  in two different ways : 1 ) @xmath209 in the sun with @xmath214 .",
    "then , @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) triggers the appearance of goldston fields in the supernova ( only out of the sphere where @xmath209 takes place in particular , if @xmath215 , @xmath216 ) and eventually @xmath1 occurs .",
    "2 ) @xmath217 lies above @xmath218 and it is @xmath219 that takes place in the sun .",
    "then , resonant @xmath1 transitions occur in the supernova with the kinematic parameters proper of solar . the solar non - adiabatic solution @xcite with parameters @xmath220@xmath221 and @xmath222 satisfies the desired condition if the  fluxes are high enough ( compare the dotted @xmath223 curve and the solid one , @xmath188 ) .",
    "this points to a distinctive feature of that phenomenon : the strong dependence on the  fluxes ( third power in the bound of eq .",
    "( [ m2mu ] ) ) should manifest by the detection of @xmath144s in the first moments of supernova observation with a energy spectrum proper of @xmath35 ( @xmath224 instead of @xmath225 ) that is not maintained later when the fluxes drop down .",
    "a crucial condition is of course that the scale of lepton numbers symmetry breaking lies at or below the fermi scale and that the goldston potentials have the right sign .",
    "the observation of the described correlation between oscillations and flux magnitudes would provide a measurement of the breaking scale .",
    "the analyses of the sn1987a events @xcite have either disfavoured the occurrence of @xmath226 oscillations by comparing the best - fit energy spectrum with the current predictions for @xmath144 and @xmath35 spectra @xcite or put a maximum limit of @xmath227 for the @xmath226 permutation probability @xcite .",
    "however , the oscillations driven by goldston fields , if they happen at all , only occur in the periods of largest fluxes .",
    "if they occur in the first 1/2 second or so of emission , the resultant hotter spectrum may manifest as a short artificial cooling time scale on the top of the real  spectrum evolution .",
    "the fits to the sn1987a time evolution indeed exhibit two time scales , one of about @xmath228 and another @xmath229 @xcite .",
    "this seems consistent with an intrinsic two phase cooling process @xcite nevertheless , it remains as a provocative piece of evidence .",
    "another point that should be kept in mind is that @xmath226 oscillations appear @xcite to be consistent or even favoured by the data when the analysis is made model independent .",
    "this may call for a @xmath37 spectrum of energies below those predicted so far but , as has been remarked recently @xcite , this may be obtained if non - elastic  scatterings in the transport sphere are taken in consideration .",
    "a typical signature of the assumed @xmath0 mixing pattern is the non - observation of the initial @xmath32 burst .",
    "it turns more subtle however when one approaches the non - adiabatic frontier because the level crossing probability @xcite depends exponentially on the inverse of the  energy .",
    "thus , almost - adiabatic transitions for @xmath230  may be consistent with the survival of the highest energy  present in the electron capture @xmath32 burst . the survival of @xmath231 @xmath32s was studied in @xcite and in particular , its consistency with the solar non - adiabatic solution .",
    "the main result of this paper is that despite the fact that true bosons only have derivative couplings with matter particles , one can prove that coherent goldstone fields develop whenever the matter charges they are associated with are not conserved in macroscopic scales .",
    "the equations of motion of the  bosons are equivalent to the conservation law of the nother currents associated to nonlinear symmetries of the type @xmath29 , these currents are a sum of a goldstone boson piece and a matter current , and , whenever the quantum numbers of the matter particles are not conserved , the  fields develop compensating terms .",
    "examples are where this may take place in a macroscopic proportion and as a result , the matter particles become subject to long range forces .    in part because the potential energies are inversely proportional to the square symmetry breaking scale and on the other hand , proportional to the time rates of particle reactions , the situations of interest are special , but not unique ! here i exercised a scenario where lepton flavour violation is realized through  oscillations in a supernova with large enough intensity to alter the @xmath0 potentials and oscillation patterns , provided that the symmetry breaking scale is less than @xmath232 .",
    "the caracteristic feature of those kind of oscillations is their correlation with the periods of largest @xmath0 fluxes thus providing a challenge to better understand the time evolution of the  signal and the flavour dependent energy spectra as well .",
    "it seems worth to explore other physical systems and symmetries .",
