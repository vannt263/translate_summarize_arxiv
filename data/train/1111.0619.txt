    "giant resonances ( grs ) have been known for several decades to be the clear manifestation of the existence of nuclear collective motion .",
    "they carry definite quantum numbers ( spatial angular momentum @xmath2 , spin @xmath3 , isospin @xmath4 ) and , as a rule , they exhaust a large fraction of the associated energy - weighted sum rule . accordingly , the macroscopic picture of a giant resonance is often thought to be that of a coherent motion of all nucleons .",
    "although a number of experimental data and theoretical studies have been cumulated , as reviewed in monographic volumes @xcite , the question still exists whether we can access only the inclusive properties of the grs ( energy and fraction of energy - weighted sum rule ) , or more exclusive properties associated with the wave function of the gr .",
    "ultimately , we can say that we miss an unambiguous confirmation of the macroscopic picture of this collective motion .",
    "giant resonances have a finite lifetime .",
    "being excited by one - body external fields , they are as a first approximation described by coherent superpositions of 1 particle-1 hole ( 1p-1h ) configurations .",
    "the most probable damping mechanism is their coupling to progressively more complicated states of 2p-2h @xmath5 @xmath6p-@xmath6h character ( up to the eventual compound nucleus state ) .",
    "the associated contribution to the total width , the so - called spreading width @xmath7 , is the dominant one .",
    "the decay width associated with the emission of one nucleon in the continuum ( escape width , @xmath8 ) is of some relevance in light nuclei but much less important in heavy nuclei .",
    "the width @xmath9 is a small fraction ( @xmath10 10@xmath11 ) of the total width . despite this",
    ", the study of the of grs has been considered a valuable tool since about 30 years @xcite .    in these works ,",
    "the fact that can be a sensitive probe of the excited multipolarity , and that @xmath12-ejectile coincidence measurements can improve the extraction of the properties of grs , has been thoroughly discussed .",
    "generally speaking , the study of the gr decay products ( whether particles or photons ) is probably the only way to shed light on the microscopic properties of the states . to provide an example different from the standard electric grs discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we can add that in stable nuclei or in neutron - rich unstable nuclei some information exist on the so - called low - lying or `` pygmy '' dipole states .",
    "their nature ( collective or non - collective , isoscalar or isovector , compressional or toroidal ) is under strong debate . for these ,",
    "as for other states , exclusive decay measurements would be of paramount importance as they could validate some theoretical picture .",
    "in this spirit we present here a consistent study of the of giant resonances , both to the ground and low - lying excited states , not considering the compound @xcite . in the past , the theoretical study of the of grs has been undertaken using frameworks like the nuclear field theory ( nft ) @xcite or the theory of finite fermi systems @xcite .",
    "these studies have elucidated the basic physical mechanisms which explain the small probabilities and have provided results in quite reasonable agreement with experiment . as we discuss below , in ref .",
    "@xcite the quenching mechanisms for the decay of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( isgqr ) to a low - lying isoscalar states , are clearly pointed out . however , these studies are based on phenomenological models .",
    "after several decades , self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) or density functional theory ( dft ) based models have been developed , and have reached considerable success for the overall description of many nuclear properties . among these models , we can single out those based , respectively , on the nonrelativistic skyrme and gogny effective interactions or on covariant ( or relativistic ) effective lagrangians .",
    "years ago , some of us developed a microscopic description of the particle decay of grs based on the use of skyrme forces @xcite .",
    "it is timely to dispose of a fully microscopic description of the with skyrme effective interactions and to assess how large predictive power it can have , and which limitations show up .",

    "we have applied our model to the of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance in @xmath0pb and @xmath1zr into the ground - state and the first low - lying octupole vibration . in particular , in @xmath0pb , in the case of the ground - state decay , we find that our outcomes are consistent with previous theoretical calculations , based on phenomenological models , and with the experimental data . in particular , all the skyrme parametrizations give a width to the ground - state of the order of hundreds of electronvolts , though , at the same time , they tend to overestimate it : these discrepancies are due to the fact that the energy of the resonance does not completely agree with the experimental data . for this reason ,",
    "we conclude that the to the ground - state is not so able to discriminate between different models , at least not more than other inclusive observable ( as energy and strength ) .    on the other hand , the to low - lying collective states",
    "is more sensitive to the interaction used . as a matter of fact ,",
    "only two interactions ( namely sly5 and skp ) manage to achieve a decay width of few electronvolts , consistently with the experimental finding . in the case of sly5",
    ", this fact is consistent with the good features that this parameter set has , as far as spin - independent processes are concerned ( correct value of the nuclear incompressibility , reasonable fit of the neutron matter equation of state , good isovector properties ) .",
    "nonetheless , the other interactions give a width @xmath9 that is of the order of tens of electronvolts and it is very much quenched with respect to the decay width associated with a single particle transition .",
    "it is quite remarkable that our calculation , being parameter - free , reproduces numbers that are several orders of magnitude smaller than the nuclear scale of @xmath10 mev .",
    "in particular , the description of the dipole spectrum is a crucial point , because small differences in the strength of the dipole states , introduced as intermediate states , change significantly the polarization of the nuclear medium . for @xmath1zr ,",
    "the general conclusion is similar : the to low - lying collective states seems to be a good observable to test the quality of different skyrme models , being very sensitive to the description of the polarization of the nuclear medium .",
    "in this appendix , we provide some details about the calculation of the diagrams shown in fig . [",
    "fig : graphs ] .    within the pvc theory ,",
    "four particle - phonon vertices are possible ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pvv ] ) , depending whether the fermionic states involved are particles or holes .",
    "they are related by the particle - hole coniugation operator ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , so that all the vertices can be brought back to @xmath93 . from the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , we get for the first vertex @xmath93 @xmath94    for example , let us now consider the vertex @xmath95 .",
    "we can move the hole states from the initial to final state ( and viceversa ) by adding an appropriate phase factor .",
    "@xmath96 which is equal to @xmath97 after the identification @xmath98 and @xmath99 , except for the phase factor .",
    "similar relations can be established between @xmath97 and @xmath100 or @xmath101 . moreover ,",
    "the vertices in which the phonon is created instead of annihilated can be derived from these latter by adding a phase factor @xmath102 , changing the sign of the projection @xmath103 of the angular momentum @xmath21 of the phonon and using the following expression for the reduced matrix element of the interaction @xmath104    these pvc vertices are then used to evaluate the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs ] . in the following , one of them ( namely fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs ] ) is calculated in detail . for each particle - phonon vertex",
    ", we have a reduced matrix element of the interaction multiplied by a 3-j symbol that takes care of the coupling of angular momenta .",
    "moreover , the single - particle operator @xmath42 brings another 3-j symbol and a matrix element . eventually , the last 3-j symbol , matching the angular momentum of the initial state , of the final one and of the operator comes from the wigner - eckart theorem , since we need a reduced matrix element .",
    "the energy denominators are obtained by using the rules of second - order perturbation theory .",
