    "let us consider the hamiltonian system @xmath5 with @xmath6 , called the _",
    "potential_. system   describes the motion of a particle in the plane submitted to the force field @xmath7 .",
    "it always admits the so - called _ hamiltonian _ @xmath8 as a rational first integral .",
    "the potential  @xmath3 is called _ ( rationally ) integrable _ if system   admits another rational first integral  @xmath9 , functionally independent on  @xmath10 . intuitively , the integrability of  @xmath3 is equivalent to the fact that   can be solved in explicit terms .",
    "integrability is a rare phenomenon and it is in general a difficult task to determine whether a given potential is integrable or not . for _ homogeneous potentials _ in  @xmath11 , _ necessary _ conditions for integrability",
    "were given by morales - ramis  @xcite and by morales - ramis - sim  @xcite .",
    "building on these works , we design in this article an algorithm which takes as input a _",
    "family _ of rational homogeneous potentials @xmath12 depending on parameters @xmath13 and which computes a set of constraints on the parameter values @xmath14 that are necessary for the integrability of  @xmath15 .",
    "these constraints turn out to be of polynomial nature in @xmath16 .",
    "there are several difficulties in this parameterized setting .",
    "the first one is that the integrability constraints provided by the morales - ramis theory on which our whole approach relies , are expressed in terms of quantities ( eigenvalues of hessian matrices at darboux points , see section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ) which are not easily accessible .",
    "we circumvent this basic difficulty by using an equation that relates the eigenvalues , but this brings a new technical complication since the equation is of diophantine type .",
    "a third difficulty is that the number of darboux points itself may depend on the parameters , leading to _ singular _ cases .",
    "we follow a classical approach , inspired mostly by ideas in  @xcite .",
    "our contribution to the topic is effective and algorithmic , as we provide a complete , proven and implemented algorithm for the problem of computing necessary integrability conditions for planar parametrized homogeneous potentials , with precise output specifications .",
    "our algorithm uses classical tools in computer algebra , such as polynomial ideal elimination based on grbner bases techniques .",
    "an important feature is the use of ( complex ) polar coordinates to represent homogeneous potentials by univariate rational functions with parameters @xmath17 .",
    "this change of representation considerably simplifies the computations and the proofs .",
    "for instance , in polar representation , _ singular _ cases are those with non - generic multiplicity of the roots / poles of @xmath18 .",
    "they are treated by our algorithm , which builds a tree containing each possible singular case .",
    "this approach is related with comprehensive grbner bases  @xcite , which are avoided here thanks to some a priori knowledge about singular cases .    in summary ,",
    "our strategy for computing necessary integrability conditions for  @xmath3 consists in  4 steps : _ ( i ) _",
    "rewrite @xmath3 in polar coordinates ; _",
    "( ii ) _ set up a diophantine equation whose solutions belong to the so - called _ morales - ramis table _ ( that contains all possible eigenvalues of the hessian of @xmath3 at darboux points of @xmath3 ) ; _ ( iii ) _ solve this diophantine equation ; _ ( iv ) _ rewrite the condition of having prescribed eigenvalues at darboux points as polynomial conditions on  @xmath19 .",
    "some prior works used a similar strategy , but it was unclear which cases were possible to tackle , in particular for singular ones .",
    "the approach was not fully automatized and this explains that results were only available for special families of potentials , for instance polynomials of small degree ( 3 or 4 )  @xcite , as the number of singular cases grows very fast ( already @xmath20 for polynomials of degree  @xmath21 ) . by contrast , our treatment is unified and fully automated , and it allows not only to retrieve ( and sometimes correct ) known results , but more importantly , to treat potentials of degrees previously unreached ( up to  9 ) . by applying our algorithm to polynomial potentials",
    ", we found three new cases admissible for integrability at degree  @xmath21 ( but still not proved to be integrable ) , and various new families for higher degrees .",
    "an even more striking application of our algorithm is the first complete proof of the non - integrability of the _ collinear three body problem _ , on which only partial results were known  @xcite .",
    "the direct approach that consists in searching first integrals @xcite is complementary to our ( non-)integrability analysis , as our algorithm helps either proving that the lists in @xcite are complete , or finding new unknown cases .    .",
    "( this is because the morales - ramis theory is much less powerful when @xmath22 . )    _ convention of notation : to avoid confusion , we will use bold letters for variables / parameters , and italic letters for parameter values_.",
    "there exist strong integrability constraints ( see theorem  [ thm : morales ] below ) .",
    "they require to deal with darboux points , whose definition we now recall .",
    "note that , by homogeneity , we could have chosen an arbitrary normalization non - zero constant on the right - hand side of  . in the literature , this normalization constant is frequently chosen equal to  @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "however , our choice is deliberate , see the remark after theorem  [ thm : morales ] .    the following result ( which is an application of a more general criterion due to morales and ramis  @xcite ) provides _ necessary _ conditions for integrability under the form of constraints on eigenvalues of hessian matrices at each darboux point .",
    "it is the basic ingredient for numerous non - integrability proofs  @xcite .",
    "roughly , its main idea is as follows .",
    "a darboux point leads to a straight line orbit of the dynamical system   associated to  @xmath3 , around which the system   can be linearized .",
    "if the whole system is integrable , then the linearized system , which in our case corresponds to a hypergeometric equation , is also integrable .",
    "thus the integrability table of theorem  [ thm : morales ] below is reminiscent of kimura s classification @xcite of solvable hypergeometric equations .",
    "[ thm : morales ] ( morales - ramis @xcite ) let @xmath6 be a homogeneous rational function of homogeneity degree @xmath1 , and let @xmath27 be a darboux point of @xmath3 . if the potential @xmath3 is integrable , then for any eigenvalue  @xmath28 of the hessian matrix of @xmath3 at @xmath29 , the pair @xmath30 belongs to the following table , for some @xmath31 .        for polynomials of degree @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "we retrieve known results ( leading to a complete classification of integrable homogeneous potentials of degree @xmath32 , and almost complete for degree @xmath33 ) . for @xmath34",

    "thus for degree @xmath41 , the only cases whose integrability status is still unknown are up to rotation - dilatation @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "so we obtained a classification of integrable homogeneous polynomial potentials of degree  @xmath41 . for degree @xmath44 and @xmath4 ,",
    "some optimizations are necessary for the algorithm to be workable .",
