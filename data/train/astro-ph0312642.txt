    "a general picture of old snrs is a hot bubble surrounded by a dense , atomic shell .",
    "the shell is preceded by snr shock , which is radiative .",
    "a shock is referred to as  radiative \" if the cooling time of the shock - heated material is shorter than the age of the shock . for the snr shock propagating in a uniform , homogeneous medium of hydrogen density @xmath6  @xmath1 , it becomes radiative when the snr is @xmath7  yrs old , or when the shock velocity drops to @xmath8  ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "the shell decelerates as it sweeps out more material , and , eventually , when the snr is @xmath9  yrs old , the velocity of the shell drops to an order of the ambient sound speed ( @xmath10  ) and the snr merges into the general interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "we may call old snrs with fast - expanding shells  snrs \" because they are observable in 21-cm emission line .",
    "a systematic 21-cm line observation of snrs to detect the expanding shells have been made by koo & heiles ( 1991 ; hereafter kh91 ) .",
    "it is difficult to detect expanding shells , because most known snrs are located in the galactic plane where the galactic background emission causes severe contamination .",
    "there had been papers reporting the detection of shells with expansion velocities smaller than @xmath1120  , but the association was rather ambiguous @xcite .",
    "if the expansion velocity of the shell is very large , larger than the maximum velocity permitted by the galactic rotation , however , then it could be easily discernable from the background emission . fig .",
    "1 shows such an example , where we can clearly see an extended high - velocity ( hv ) excess emission localized at the position of the snr hb  21 .",
    "the positional coincidence and the forbidden velocity strongly suggest that the excess emission is emitted from the gas accelerated by the snr shock .",
    "kh91 carried out a sensitive survey of 21  cm emission lines toward 103 northern galactic snrs and detected such hv gas toward 15 snrs ) and the classical source ic  443 . ] , including 34 snrs known prior to the survey ( denoyer 1978 ; giovanelli & haynes 1979 ; landecker , roger , & higgs 1980 ; braun & strom 1986 ; koo 1990 ) .",
    "koo , kang , & mcclure - griffiths ( 2003 ) searched for similar features toward 97 southern snrs using the southern galactic plane survey data ( mcclure - griffiths 2001 ) and identified another 10 snrs .",
    "these @xmath12 ) snrs are _ candidates _ for snrs because the surveys were made using single - dish radio telescopes with a large ( @xmath13 or 16@xmath14 ) beam size and high - resolution observational studies are necessary for confirming the nature of the hv emission .",
    "such high - resolution studies have been done for some of the snrs and confirmed the shell - like structure of the hv features , e.g. , ctb 80 @xcite , w44 @xcite , w51c @xcite , and ic 443 @xcite .",
    "but molecular lines studies showed that the latter three snrs exhibit evidences for the interaction with molecular clouds , e.g. , broad molecular lines , high - ratio of high- to low - transition co lines , 1720-mhz maser line of the oh molecule , etc .",
    "( see koo 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the hv gas in these snrs is possibly formed by a radiative shock propagating through molecular clouds , not by the shock propagating through the general diffuse ism . in summary , including the ones interacting with molecular clouds , there are 25 snr candidates which appear to have shock - accelerated gas at velocities forbidden by the galactic rotation .    how does this compare to the expected number of snrs in the galaxy ?",
    "if we naively multiply the total supernova rate ( @xmath15  yr@xmath16 ) in the galaxy to the lifetime ( @xmath17  yr ) of snrs , we get @xmath18 .",
    "the majority of supernovae ( sne ) , however , are core - collapse sne with massive progenitors .",
    "massive stars are born in associations , and most of these sne dissipate their energy in producing superbubbles instead of isolated snrs . also , a significant fraction of sne occur in the galactic halo where they merge into the ambient ism before cooling becomes important . and",
    ", if the structure of the ism is close to the three - phase model of the @xcite so that most of the interstellar space is filled with hot tenuous ( @xmath19  @xmath1 ) medium , the snrs may overlap with other snrs before dense shell formation .",
    "meanwhile , the majority of snrs may not be visible because of the contamination due to the galactic background emission and the limited sensitivity .",
    "the effect of the background contamination is difficult to calculate in general , which hampers the estimation of the number of visible snrs .",
    "but , for the snrs , if we limit to the ones with large expansion velocities as in fig .",
    "1 , it is straightforward to calculate the effect because the boundary of the background emission in fig",
    ". 1 is mainly determined by the galactic rotation .",
    "therefore , the statistics of such snrs can be related to the galactic distribution of sne , their environments , and the evolution of their remnants .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a model to estimate the visibility of snrs in the galaxy .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe our model and formulation .",
    "we model the galactic disk as an axi - symmetric , uniform , homogeneous disk with a central hole .",
    "we estimate the frequency and distribution of sne in the disk using recent observational results on extragalactic sne and old disk stars .",
    "we summarize the dynamical evolution of old snrs in homogeneous , uniform medium and devise the detection probability .",
    "section 3 presents the results , where we show the expected distribution of snrs in the galactic plane and their statistics .",
    "we explore how the background contamination and the telescope sensitivity limit the visible number of snrs . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the effect of embedded clouds and compare the result with observations .",
    "what would be the nature of the ism that a typical isolated snr experiences ?",
    "this is perhaps the very essential question in deriving the number of snrs because the formation and evolution of dense radiative shells depend on the physical properties of the ambient ism .",
    "a general picture of the ism is dense clouds immersed in a diffuse intercloud medium , perhaps except regions surrounding ob stars where the clouds might have vanished through photoevaporation and rocket effect due to strong uv radiation ( e.g. , mckee , van buren , & lazareff 1984 ) .",
    "the birthplaces for the isolated sne are presumably far from ob stars , so as to be close to the general ism .",
    "then , although the embedded clouds may modify the internal structure through evaporation , it is the intercloud medium that primarily controls the dynamical evolution of snrs ( e.g. , cowie , mckee , & ostriker 1981 ) , and the question is what the physical conditions of the intercloud medium are .",
    "there have been substantial studies on this subject , and it is generally considered that the major component of the intercloud medium is either the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) with a typical density of @xmath0  @xmath1 as in the two - phase model of field , goldsmith , & habing ( 1969 ) or the hot ionized medium ( him ) of @xmath19  @xmath1 as in the three - phase model of @xcite ( see mckee 1995 for a review ) .",
    "relative filling factors of the two phases , however , are poorly known even in the solar neighborhood .",
    "if it is the him , then most of the snrs might dissipate their energy without forming a radiative shell , and there will be only a few snrs . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the number of snrs assuming that the intercloud medium is composed with the wnm only , and , by comparing the result with observations , we will infer the structure of the ism .",
    "we assume that the gas in the galaxy is confined to an axi - symmetric , center - emptied disk with an inner edge at 3.5 kpc and outer edge at 15 kpc .",
    "the total column density perpendicular to the galactic plane is approximately constant between 3.5 kpc and 20 kpc , but has a central hole .",
    "the inner edge represents the boundary where the surface density drops rapidly @xcite .",
    "we take the outer edge of the disk at 15 kpc ( instead of 20 kpc ) considering that the distribution of isolated sne are possibly truncated at @xmath20  kpc ( see section 2.2 ) . even if there is no truncation",
    ", the small disk size should not notably affect the result because , as we discuss in section 2.2 , the isolated sne are considered to be centrally concentrated with a short ( @xmath21 kpc ) exponential radial scale length .",
    "we assume that the thickness of the disk is constant and the density distribution is uniform .",
    "the real galactic disk is warped and flares outside the solar circle ( kulkarni , blitz , & heiles 1982 ; lockman 1984 ) . but this complexity should have little effect on the result because , firstly , most ( @xmath22% ) sne occur within the solar circle and , secondly , the stellar disk and , therefore the sne disk , warps and flares too @xcite .",
    "our formulation is essentially two - dimensional and the primary purpose of considering the thickness of the disk is to estimate the fraction of sne that explodes in the very tenuous halo , which may not evolve to snrs ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "according to kh91 , all the snr candidates in the inner galaxy is within @xmath23  pc , while , in the outer galaxy , the one ( cta 1 ) located at the farthest from the midplane is at @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the galactocentric radius and @xmath26 is the height above the midplane .",
    "the latter corresponds to @xmath27  pc at @xmath28  kpc if we consider that the thickness of the disk flares almost linearly outside the solar circle . considering this , we adopt the half - thickness of our disk to be 320 pc , i.e. , sne occurring outside this disk",
    "are assumed not to form an shell .",
    "this is greater than the half - width at half - maximum ( 265 pc ) of the thick gaussian component and less than the scale height ( 403 pc ) of the exponential component of the disk @xcite .",
    "the total intercloud column density perpendicular to the galactic plane in the solar neighborhood is @xmath29  @xmath1 pc @xcite , and we require our model disk to have the same vertical column density .",
    "therefore , the density of our disk @xmath30 .",
    "for such axi - symmetric , two - dimensional disk , the number of observable snrs can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total _",
    "isolated _ sn rate in the galaxy , @xmath33 is the fraction of isolated sne that produces snrs ( i.e. , the fraction within the center - emptied model gaseous disk ) , @xmath34 is the lifetime of snrs , and @xmath35 the fraction of snrs that are detectable : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the surface density distribution of sne , i.e. , the sn rate per unit area as a function of galactocentric radius @xmath25 , and @xmath38 is the probability that a snr of age @xmath39 is detectable considering the background contamination and the telescope sensitivity .",
    "@xmath40 represents a coordinate grid centered at the galactic center and the integration range over @xmath40 is from @xmath41  kpc to 15 kpc . if the detection probability @xmath38 is independent of @xmath40 and is equal to 1 during @xmath34 , then @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the following sections , we estimate the individual items in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .      for our purpose , sne are divided into two types : supernovae of type ia ( sne ia ) which have old disk stars as their progenitors and the  core - collapse \" sne ( e.g. , type ib / c and type ii sne ; hereafter sne ii ) which have massive progenitors .",
    "sne ii may be further divided into two groups ; ones exploding in associations and the other exploding isolated .",
    "most of the former sne are expected to explode within a superbubble where the density is very low and pressure is very high .",
    "such snrs might dissipate their energy before radiative cooling becomes important , and we consider that they do not evolve to snrs .",
    "the latter group is consisted of  runaway \" ob stars which are ejected from their parent association and also possibly the ob stars formed isolated . @xcite",
    "derived that 1025% of o stars are runaways while only about 2% of early b stars , which contribute most of the sne , are runaways .",
    "this led @xcite to conclude that there is no need to assume a separate population of isolated ob stars . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite analyzed the catalog of ob stars compiled by @xcite and @xcite , and concluded that 40% of sne ii occurs isolated ( see also mckee 1990 ) . among the historical sne ii , at least crab is not associated with a group of ob stars and its progenitor could have been a runaway @xcite .",
    "we assume that all sne ii explode in groups and that only sne ia produce isolated snrs that can evolve to snrs .",
    "the basic idea is to choose parameters to minimize the number of snrs when they are uncertain , so that the derived number is to be a lower limit .",
    "if the population of isolated ob stars is indeed significant , then the expected number of snrs will be larger than the calculated below .",
    "the galactic sn ia rate is inferred from the extragalactic sn rates , which are usually expressed in snu or sn ( 100 yr)@xmath16 ( @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the blue luminosity of the galaxy ( e.g. , van den bergh & mcclure 1994 ; cappellaro , evans , & turatto 1999 ) .",
    "our galaxy is considered to be a spiral of hubble type sb or sbc with @xmath46  @xmath47 @xcite , and we take the arithmetic mean of the average rates of s0a - sb and sbc - sd galaxies in @xcite to obtain the total sn ia rate of @xmath48 yr@xmath16 .",
    "( for comparison , the total sn ii rate is @xmath49  yr@xmath16 . )",
    "it is noted that this sn ia rate is higher than the one ( 0.30.4@xmath50 ) derived from the nova rate @xcite , but consistent with the estimate ( 0.30.6@xmath50 ) of @xcite .",
    "sne are centrally concentrated and vertically stratified , presumably following the distribution of their progenitors .",
    "the progenitors of sn ia are mostly old disk stars .",
    "bulge stars could contribute as much as @xmath51% to the total sn ia rate if the sn rate scales with the mass ratio of the bulge ( @xmath52  ) to the disk ( @xmath53  ) @xcite .",
    "but the rate of sn ia within 1 kpc of the center of spiral galaxies has been found to be significantly lower than outside this region ( wang , hflich , & wheeler 1997 ; hatano , branch , & deaton 1998 ) , which suggests that the sn ia occurs in the bulge not as frequently as expected .",
    "the space density of old disk stars perpendicular to the galactic plane can be accurately represented by the sum of two exponentials , one with a characteristic scale height of @xmath54  pc and the other which has a scale height of @xmath6  kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the latter ",
    "thick disk \" stars appear older ( @xmath55  yr ) and more metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath56 ) than the former  thin \" disk @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the thick disk stars is @xmath57 of the thin disk stars ( trimble 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , if the sn ia rates of thin and thick disks are proportional to their masses , the thick disk could contribute at most @xmath58% of the thin disk to the total sn ia rate .",
    "we neglect the small uncertain contributions from the bulge and thick disk , and assume that the old stellar disk representing the sn ia progenitors has a vertical exponential distribution with a scale height of 300 pc at @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that , in the solar neighborhood , 34% of sne ia explodes outside our @xmath60  pc - thick gaseous disk .",
    "we further assume that this fraction remains constant over the full disk , e.g. , we assume that the fraction of sne ia exploding in the ` halo ' and not evolving to snrs @xmath61 .",
    "this is not unreasonable because the old stellar disk warps and flares as the gaseous disk does @xcite .",
    "but the flaring of the stellar disk may start well inside the solar circle @xcite , in which case the assumption of the constant fraction underestimates the sn ia rate in the inner galaxy .    the radial surface distribution of old stellar disk is usually described by a single exponential profile , but the radial scale lengths quoted in published papers span an enormous range : 1.8 to 6 kpc ( kent , dame , & fazio 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "recent near - infrared studies based on the the _",
    "cobe_/dirbe data or the two micron all sky survey data appear to yield a shorter scale length ( 2.12.8 kpc ) consistently ( freudenreich 1998 ; ojha 2001 ; drimmel & spergel 2001 and references therein ) . on the other hand , studies on extragalactic",
    "sne show that , although the number of sn ia is small ( 54 ) to constrain the slope very well , the distribution could be represented by a single radial scale length of @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the semimajor axes of isophote having 25.0 mag arcsec@xmath64 in blue @xcite . the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , for example ,",
    "has @xmath65  kpc ( trimble 2000 ) , so that the radial scale length of sn ia would be @xmath66  kpc .",
    "we adopt 3.0 kpc as the radial scale length of the sn ia surface density distribution in the galaxy , and assume that the distribution extends all the way to the galactic center .",
    "the stellar disk may have a central hole where a stellar bar is located @xcite .",
    "but , since the surface density profile averaged over the azimuth remains approximately exponential to the center @xcite , the assumption of an axisymmetric exponential distribution is plausible .",
    "hence , after normalization , the sn rate per unit area in our model disk is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68  kpc@xmath64 yr@xmath16 . with the above distribution , the fraction exploding inside the central hole @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the fraction of isolated sne that explodes within our model gaseous disk @xmath70 .",
    "the frequency of snrs in our model disk , therefore , is @xmath71  yr@xmath16 , or one per 500 yrs .      in our model ,",
    "snrs evolve in a homogeneous , uniform medium and we are interested in their late - stage evolution .",
    "( the effect of embedded clouds will be discussed in section 4.1 . )",
    "snrs form a dense , neutral shell through radiative cooling when the cooling time of the shock - heated material becomes shorter than the age of the snrs .",
    "numerical studies showed that the shell formation occurs ` catastrophically ' , accompanying multiple shocks and oscillations of shock velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shell is also dynamically unstable to develop nonspherical structure @xcite .",
    "but this violent transition lasts only for a relatively short time , and the global dynamics of radiative snrs for most of time could be described by a spherically - symmetric , steady model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the results of @xcite in the following to describe the snr evolution .",
    "their model neglects magnetic field and thermal conduction .",
    "magnetic field inhibits compression to make the shell thicker and the outer radius larger .",
    "thermal conduction lowers the temperature and increases the density in the hot bubble , the effectiveness of which depends on the magnetic field configuration .",
    "these effects , however , are dynamically important only at very late times when the shell is sufficiently slowed down . for example , the radius and velocity of the shell in the numerical result of @xcite , which includes a uniform 5  @xmath72 g magnetic field and unimpeded thermal conduction , are described well by the formulae in this section until the expansion velocity drops to @xmath73  . for a tangled random magnetic field",
    ", the shell will be more compressible and the effect of the conduction will be reduced ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , so that the agreement will persist at lower velocities .",
    "since the visible snrs have large ( @xmath74  ) expansion velocities ( section 2.4 ) , the magnetic field and thermal conduction may be neglected in our formulation .",
    "we consider the time when the first element of shocked - heated gas cools to zero as the onset of the formation of shell .",
    "this shell - formation time @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the sn energy released to the ism in units of @xmath78 , and we assumed that the metallicity is given by solar abundances .",
    "after some finite violent transition period , the shell expands steadily , driving a radiative shock .",

    "a statistical property that can be directly compared with the observations is the galactic longitude distribution of snrs ( fig .",

    "the real ism is pervaded by cold clouds and their effect on our results should be discussed .",
    "the evolution of snrs in a cloudy ism has been studied numerically by @xcite .",
    "one of their models ( model 6 ) is for the two - phase ism and applicable to our case .",
    "they adopted @xmath178  @xmath1 and @xmath179 , and assumed that the spitzer s standard clouds @xcite are randomly distributed with a relatively large ( 7% ) volume filling factor ( see below ) .",
    "they simulated the evolution until the beginning of radiative phase and showed that neither cloud evaporation nor the dynamical effects of the clouds affect the evolution of snrs in a significant way .",
    "their shell - formation time and radius agree with those from equations ( 4 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "they did not derive the fraction @xmath180 of mass compressed into neutral shell at the time of shell formation , but , since the interior structure is only slightly modified , we expect that @xmath180 is not significantly different from the homogeneous case , i.e. , 0.5 .    in radiative phase ,",
    "the cloud - shell interaction depends on the ratio of their column densities .",
    "the column density of the shell of the visible snrs is ( 3.38.8)@xmath181  cm@xmath64 ( cf . equation 11 ) , which is less than that of typical clouds ( @xmath183  cm@xmath64 ) .",
    "thus , the collisions with clouds will punch holes in the shell @xcite . the hot interior gas , however , will drive a shock to reform the missing portion of the shell . since the column density for a strong shock to be radiative @xmath184 @xcite , the required distance for the reformation of the shell is @xmath185  pc",
    "this is much less than the mean distance for a particular portion of the shell to experience successive collisions ( see below ) .",
    "hence , in the two - phase ism , the snrs will be punched by cold clouds as they expand , but the holes will be quickly recovered .",
    "the shell loses mass and momentum by the collision with clouds .",
    "the evolution of such radiative snrs in cloudy medium has been analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the key factor that determines the importance of clouds is @xmath186 $ ] where @xmath187 is the cloud mean free path .",
    "for example , the mass in the shell at the time of shell formation decreases by this factor due to the collisions with clouds as it expands . if @xmath188 , therefore , the ` cloud - punching ' is not important .",
    "if the clouds are spherical with radius @xmath189 and their volume filling factor is @xmath190 , then @xmath191 .",
    "the filling factor of cold clouds can be inferred from their characteristic and space - averaged densities .",
    "the two - phase equilibrium yields the density of cold clouds @xmath192  @xmath1 , which agrees with observations @xcite .",
    "the space - averaged density of cold near the sun is @xmath193",
    "@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that @xmath194% . the characteristic radius of the clouds inferred from the column density ( @xmath195  cm@xmath64 ) of ` standard ' clouds @xcite is @xmath196  pc",
    ". therefore , @xmath197  pc and @xmath198 for visible snrs .",
    "this implies that the cloud punching effect is not important for the evolution of visible snrs and therefore for their statistics .",
    "recently @xcite showed that in two regions they studied the cold ism is distributed in huge blobby sheets of thickness @xmath199 and @xmath200  pc with lengh - to - thickness aspect ratios @xmath201 and @xmath202 , and , proposed that , if these characteristics are general , the cold ism could be organized into a small number of large sheetlike structures instead of a large number of randomly distributed small clumps .",
    "if the ism morphology is close to this clumpy sheet model , then the probability for a snr to cross the sheets will be small and only a portion of the snr will be affected by the interaction , so that the the statistics of snrs will be determined by the nature of the intercloud medium .",
    "our results can be compared with results of kh91 and @xcite introduced in section 1 . in short , kh91 did a sensitive survey of 21 cm emission lines toward 103 northern galactic snrs using the hat creek 26-m telescope ( @xmath203 ) , and detected faint extended wing at forbidden velocities toward 15 snrs . )",
    "snrs increased from 103 to 152 ( green 2001 ) , so that the number would increase to @xmath204 by scaling .",
    "but this would not affect the discussion in this paper . ]",
    "the sensitivity ( 1.5@xmath205 ) of the survey was @xmath206  k. @xcite searched for similar features toward 97 southern snrs and identified another 10 snrs .",
    "the southern galactic plane survey data was obtained with the parkes 64-m telescope ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "the sensitivity ( @xmath208 ) of the survey was 0.090.14 k. these 25 ( = 15 + 10 ) snrs constitute the snr candidates ( see comment in section 1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the expected number from model b for the parameters of kh91 , e.g. , @xmath209 , is @xmath210 , and for those of @xcite is @xmath211190220 .",
    "therefore , the observed number of snrs is less than the expected by a factor of @xmath212 .",
    "6 shows the galactic longitude distribution of the snr candidates . for comparison , we show the expected distributions and also the distribution of all known galactic snrs in the green s catalog ( green 2001 ) .",
    "most candidates in the first quadrant have an excess emission at positive velocities , while those in the fourth quadrant at negative velocities .",
    "this seems to be consistent with our expectation ( fig .",
    "4 ) . fig .",
    "7 shows the angular size distribution .",
    "most ( 72% ) galactic snrs have sizes smaller than 30@xmath14 , while the average size of snr candidates is @xmath213 .",
    "a significant ( 36% ) fraction of snr candidates has size less than @xmath177 whereas none is expected from the model .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed and the expected numbers is significant and needs to be explained .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the old snrs are too faint to be identified in radio continuum , so that the surveys by kh91 and @xcite , which were based on the current ( radio continuum - based ) snr catalog , might have missed most of the snrs with shells .",
    "this thought led us to search for snrs _ based on the data_. we used the leiden - dwingeloo ( ld ) survey data , which was obtained by @xcite using the dwingeloo 25-m radio telescope ( hpbw=36@xmath14 ) .",
    "the survey covers the galactic plane ( @xmath214 ) between @xmath166 and 260@xmath174 , and the rms sensitivity of the final data cube is 0.07  k. we first examined about 130 snrs in the green s catalogue and have found high - velocity features toward @xmath215 snrs .",
    "these snrs look protruding from their surroundings in ( @xmath129 , @xmath216 ) diagram ( cf .",
    "we then examined individual ( @xmath217 ) maps with the naked eye , and have identified @xmath202 similar - looking , forbidden - velocity features not related to the known snrs .",
    "8 is an example where we can see several such features .",
    "some of these  forbidden - velocity ( fv ) wings \" are associated with galaxies or perhaps hii regions , but most ( 70% ) of them are not .",
    "could they be the so - far undiscovered old snrs ?",
    "we have been looking into these regions in various wavelengths , but have not identified their natures yet .",
    "but the distribution of fv wings appears to be very different from the expected distribution of visible snrs ( fig .",
    "9 ) : between @xmath166 and 70@xmath174 , the number of fv wings is much less than the expected number of snrs , while , between @xmath218 and @xmath219 , it is significantly greater in general .",
    "possible candidates for such extended forbidden - velocity wings other than snrs are stellar wind - blown shells , neutral stellar winds associated with protostars @xcite , high - velocity and/or intermediate clouds , galaxies , etc .",
    "the detailed results are in preparation @xcite .",
    "if the observed number ( @xmath4 ) turns out to be close to the total number of snrs in the galaxy , then the discrepancy implies that either some of our input parameters are inaccurate or some of our basic assumptions are wrong .",
    "the parameters and assumptions regarding the frequency and distribution of sne , however , are chosen to minimize the number of snrs when they are uncertain , e.g. , we have assumed that all core - collapse sne explode in groups and only sne ia produce isolated snrs .",
    "the total sn ia rate can not be much lower than what we adopted ( @xmath48 ) if we consider that there are at least two sn ia ( tycho and sn 1006 ) during last 2,000 years in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we have discussed the effect of magnetic fields , thermal conduction , and embedded clouds on the evolution of snrs in sections 2.3 and 4.1 , and concluded that they are not dynamically important for the visible snrs which are moving fast . if the disk is denser and thinner , the number of visible snrs will decrease , but not by a large factor .",
    "for example , if the density of the disk is @xmath220  @xmath1 and its thickness is @xmath221  pc , the number decreases by @xmath222% .",
    "one possibility is that the interstellar space in the inner galaxy is not filled with wnm , but mostly filled with a very hot , diffuse ( @xmath19  @xmath1 ) medium as in the three phase model of @xcite .",
    "in such a tenuous medium , the snrs develop dense shells when they are very old ( @xmath223  yr , equation 4 ) , at which time their radius is 230 pc .",
    "but this radius is very large , so that it is possible that the snrs come into equilibrium with the interstellar pressure or overlap with other snrs before dense shell formation , in which case shells are not formed @xcite .",
    "embedded clouds could be accelerated by the snr shock and also by the ram pressure , but numerical simulations by @xcite showed that they are substantially destroyed by evaporation before acquiring high velocities .",
    "in the three - phase ism , the observed snrs may be the ones in special environments , e.g. , near large atomic or molecular clouds .",
    "the above conclusion on the structure of the ism in the inner galaxy would not be totally changed even if the fv wing sources turn out to be snrs because , according to fig .",
    "9 , there are much less number of fv wings than what the model predicts in the inner galaxy . in the outer galaxy , however , the number is significantly greater than the predicted .",
    "the model distribution can be made to have more snrs in the outer galaxy , for example , by increasing the radial scale length of sne distribution , but it can not be made to be consistent with the observed fv wing distribution simply by changing some of its parameters .",
    "we postpone further discussion on the fv wings and their significance after identifying their natures .",
    "we have developed a simple model to estimate the number of old , radiative snrs visible in 21-cm emission line in the galaxy .",
    "old snrs are expected to be surrounded by rapidly expanding shells , but the contamination due to the galactic background emission severely limits their visibility .",
    "the visible snrs are defined as the ones with a sufficiently large expansion velocity , so that their line - of - sight velocities are significantly ( @xmath224  ) outside the velocity range of the galactic background emission .",
    "another factor that determines the visibility is the telescope sensitivity , which is included in our formulation .",
    "some of the essential features of our model are ( 1 ) the gas in the galaxy is confined to an axi - symmetric , center - emptied disk with an inner edge at 3.5 kpc and outer edge at 15 kpc , ( 2 ) the disk is uniform and homogeneous , and the density of the disk is @xmath225  @xmath1 , ( 3 ) the disk is rotating with a constant speed @xmath226  , ( 4 ) only sne ia produce isolated snrs , ( 5 ) total galactic sn ia rate is @xmath48  yr@xmath16 , but only 44% of them explodes within the gaseous disk to produce snrs ( 34% explodes above and below the disk while 22% within the central hole ) , and ( 6 ) the sne ia are exponentially distributed with a radial scale length of 3 kpc .",
    "we use the equations of @xcite in a slightly modified form to calculate how the radius , velocity , and mass of a snr shell vary with time , and , at each position in the disk , we derive the number of visible snrs .    according to our result , the number of snrs in the galaxy is 2850 .",
    "galactic background contamination limits the number of visible snrs to @xmath2 , or @xmath3% of the total snrs .",
    "they are concentrated along the loci of tangential points and near @xmath166 ( fig .",
    "the telescope sensitivity may prevent observing the ones on the far side of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "we have calculated the expected number of visible snrs for realistic observational parameters and compared the results with observations .",
    "there have been two systematic 21-cm emission line studies toward 103 northern and 97 southern snrs , and faint extended wings at forbidden velocities have been detected toward 25 snrs ( kh91 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the expected number is much ( @xmath212 ) greater than this .",
    "we consider that our estimate is on the conservative side and the discrepancy is significant .",
    "a plausible explanation is that previous observational studies , which were made toward the snrs identified in radio continuum , missed most of the snrs because they are too faint to be visible in radio continuum .",
    "we propose that the faint extended wings at forbidden velocities seen in 21-cm line surveys ( e.g. , fig .",
    "8) could be possible candidates for such old snrs . according to our our preliminary result",
    ", however , their galactic longitude distribution is quite different from the expected distribution of visible snrs , e.g. , the number of fv wings is considerably less than the expected in the inner galaxy .",
    "the natures of the fv wings need to be identified .",
    "if the observed number ( @xmath4 ) turns out to be close to the total number of snrs in the galaxy , then the discrepancy implies that either some of our input parameters are inaccurate or some of our basic assumptions are wrong .",
    "a possible explanation is that the interstellar space in the inner galaxy is largely filled with a very tenuous gas as in the three - phase ism model . in this case , the observed snrs are likely the ones in special environments , e.g. , near large atomic or molecular clouds .",

    "<S> we conclude that a possible explanation for the small number of snrs in the inner galaxy is that the interstellar space there is largely filled with a very tenuous gas as in the three - phase ism model , not with the warm neutral medium of moderate density .    </S>",
