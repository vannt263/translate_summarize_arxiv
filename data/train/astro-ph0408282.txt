    "v4334  sgr ( sakurai s object ) continues to be the subject of intense interest .",
    "it is a low - mass ( @xmath2 ) star that is retracing its evolution along the hertzsprung - russell diagram following a very late thermal pulse ( herwig 2001 ) .",
    "the star is at the centre of a faint planetary nebula ( pn ) of diameter @xmath3 ( e.g. pollacco 1999 ; bond & pollacco 2002 ) and , after an early incarnation as an f - type star , it underwent a transformation to a carbon star in 1997 .",
    "little is known observationally about the evolution of the star since mid-1998 , when it was completely obscured by an optically thick dust shell from which ( as of april 2004 ) it has still not emerged ; a dramatic illustration of the obscuration is given by bond & pollacco ( 2002 ) . since the major dust event of 1998 the @xmath1  spectum is black - body - like and is simply that of the dust shell .",
    "analysis of the post-1998 infrared ( ir ) observations has shown that the dust is carbon , primarily in amorphous form ( geballe et al . 2002 ; tyne et al .",
    "2002 ; eyres et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the @xmath1  spectra during the period 1999 - 2001 were consistent with a mass - loss that increased from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( for the gas - to - dust ratio of 75 we adopt here ; see  [ 75 ] below ) , while the maximum grain radius in a grain size distribution @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) increased by a factor @xmath8 ( tyne et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we first observed v4334  sgr at sub - millimetre wavelengths with the scuba instrument ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) in 2001 august , and reported marginal detections at both 450  and 850  ( evans et al . 2002 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "we report here the results of our continued monitoring of sakurai s object at these wavelengths .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ masses ]    the 450  and 850  light curves are shown in fig .  [ lc ] .",
    "we see a consistent and significant rise in the 850  flux density between 2001 august and 2003 sepember ; the behaviour of the 450  data is consistent with the rise at 850 , but of course the 450  calibration is less certain . in paper  i we considered the possibility that the 450/840  emission detected in 2001 august might have originated in the old pn but we concluded that the emission originated in material ejected in the 1995 event .",
    "the fact that the sub - millimetre flux densities rise so dramatically is consistent with this conclusion .",
    "we first note that the sub - millimetre data may imply a drop in the @xmath9-index of the dust ( defined in the usual way such that the dust emissivity at frequency @xmath10 is @xmath11 ) , from @xmath12 in 2001 august to @xmath13 in 2003 .",
    "this may indicate changes in ( a )  the nature of the dust ( e.g. as grains grow , or are processed ) and/or ( b )  the dust distribution , allowing hotter grains ( which have flatter emissivities , cf .",
    "mennella et al .",
    "1998 ) to contribute more to the observed flux .",
    "however any conclusion along these lines must await detailed modelling combining both ukirt ( e.g. tyne et al .",
    "2002 , eyres et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and jcmt datasets ; such an analysis will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the referee has pointed out that the sub - millimetre rise could be due to the anticipated rise in effective temperature as the star retraces its post - agb evolution towards the pn phase , and the consequent heating of the inner dust shell .",
    "while observational evidence that this process may have started has been presented by kerber et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we do not consider that this accounts for the rise in the sub - millimetre flux for reasons which may be discerned from fig .",
    "[ sak_late03 ] .    in this figure",
    "we plot the jcmt data from 15 june 2003 ( table  [ fluxes ] ) , together with the 25  data obtained in september 2003 from our ukirt programme ( eyres et al .",
    ", in preparation ) ; we assume that variations are sufficiently slow that the data can be combined . both sets of data are reasonably fitted by a @xmath14  k black - body ( cf . equation  ( [ temp ] ) below , and @xmath15  k for the ukirt data alone ; eyres et al .",
    "2004 ) , suggesting that the 25  and sub - millimetre emission have common origin .    we might envisage a scenario in which the sub - millimetre emission in fig .",
    "[ sak_late03 ] comes from inner , hotter , dust whose near - ir emission does not penetrate the outer region of the dust shell , while the observed near - ir emission comes from dust in the outer shell having very steep @xmath9-index .",
    "however such a situation would be _ ad hoc _ and contrived .",
    "indeed that the @xmath9-index is close to zero in late 2003 is supported both by the 450/850 flux ratio , and by the closeness of the 2850data to a black - body at @xmath16  k ( see fig .",
    "[ sak_late03 ] ) .",
    "( 5.0,5.0 ) ( 0.0,4.0 )    we therefore make the assumptions that ( i )  the emission we detect at 450  and 850  is from the dust shell ( any emission at these wavelengths from the star ",
    "whatever its effective temperature  is at the few @xmath17jy level at most ) , ( ii )  the dust shell is optically thin at sub - millimetre wavelengths and ( iii )  the sub - millimetre emission is on the rayleigh - jeans tail .",
    "we justify ( ii )  by noting that the optical depth @xmath18 at wavelength @xmath19 ( in ) is @xmath20 , since the optical depth in the visual is @xmath21 ( see tyne et al .",
    "2002 ) , and ( iii )  is valid if the dust temperature is @xmath22  k. eyres et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that a @xmath1  spectrum of sakurai s object obtained on 2003 september  8 is well - described by a black - body at temperature @xmath23  k , consistent with continued cooling of the dust shell ; thus ( iii )  is certainly justified .",
    "we therefore have that @xmath24 where the constant @xmath25 for 450 , and @xmath26 for 850 . in equation  ( [ eq ] )",
    "@xmath27 is the dust mass , @xmath28 is the distance of sakuai s object ( see kimeswenger 2002 ) , @xmath29 is an appropriate value for the dust temperature ( see below ) , @xmath30 is the absorption coefficient for the dust , and @xmath31 depends on physical conditions in the dust shell ( e.g. @xmath32 for an optically thin , isothermal shell ) .",
    "( 5.0,5.0 ) ( 0.0,4.0 )    although equation  ( [ eq ] ) applies to an optically thin , isothermal shell , it is also accurate , to within a factor @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 are respectively the inner and outer radii of the dust shell ) , to the case of a dust shell with grain density law @xmath35 that is optically thick at short ( @xmath0 optical / near - ir ) wavelengths , optically thin in the sub - millimetre , and for which the dust temperature depends on distance @xmath36 from the star as @xmath37 ( see ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) . in this case @xmath29 in equation  ( [ eq ] ) is the temperature of the coolest dust ; we take this to be the dust seen in the @xmath1  data , which still detect the dust ` pseudophotosphere ' ( tyne et al .",
    "2002 , eyres et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "it is not unreasonable to assume that the dust shell around sakurai s object is geometrically thick , so that @xmath38 ; for this case @xmath39 and we use this value here ( see also below ) .    for the distance , we take @xmath40  kpc ( see kimeswenger 2002 ) , and we have taken @xmath30 from mennella et al .",
    "( 1998 ; their @xmath30 values for amorphous carbon at 295  k , which is likely to be close to that appropriate for sakurai s object ) .",
    "we give values of @xmath27@xmath29 , computed from equation  ( [ eq ] ) , in table  [ masses ] for both wavelengths . for each epoch , we have estimated the temperature @xmath29 of the coolest dust by ( i )  fitting a black - body to @xmath1data obtained in the course of our ir monitoring programme ( see tyne et al .",
    "2002 , eyres et al .",
    "2004 , and paper in preparation ) and ( ii )  fitting an exponential decline to the time - dependence of @xmath29 .",
    "we find : @xmath41 \\ : \\ : , \\label{temp}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and the uncertainty in @xmath29 is typically @xmath43% in reproducing the values in tyne et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and eyres et al .",
    "we stress that this expression is not physically meaningful , and we will refine it as we obtain further ir data ; we use it simply as a means of interpolating the value of @xmath29 at the time of our scuba observations .",
    "these values are included in table  [ masses ] , together with the corresponding dust masses @xmath27 ; the uncertainties in @xmath27 include an uncertainty of 10% in estimating @xmath29 .",
    "neither the values of @xmath27@xmath29 , nor of @xmath27 , should of course depend on wavelength , and the discrepancies between the 450and 850  values are due to the uncertainties in the 450calibration , the error in the interpolated temperature , uncertainty in the properties of the dust , and the fact that the @xmath1  emission differs somewhat from a black - body .",
    "nevertheless the data at both wavelengths are consistent with a steady increase in the dust mass between 2001 august and 2003 june .",
    "the dust mass may be converted to a circumstellar mass @xmath44 if we assume a gas - to - dust ratio , and that the gas - to - dust ratio remains constant in time .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio for solar abundances and in the interstellar medium is @xmath45 ( e.g. whittet 2003 ) , while a value 200 was assumed by tyne et al .",
    "these values are unlikely to be appropriate for the h - deficient , he- and c - rich wind of sakurai s object . if we take the abundances for 1996 july 3 from asplund et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , assume that all o is locked up in co ( see eyres et al .",
    "2004 ) and that the remaining c is tied up in dust , we get a gas - to - dust ratio of 26 ; this is most likely a lower limit .",
    "we assume an intermediate value of 75 here ; the uncertainties in the gas - to - dust ratio and in the value of @xmath31 clearly lead to a corresponding uncertainty in dust mass , but we believe that _ changes _ in the latter should be reliable .",
    "the corresponding circumstellar masses are given in table  [ masses ] ; the dependence of circumstellar mass on time is shown in fig .",
    "[ dmass ] .",
    "we use these data to determine the average mass - loss rate over the period 2001 august to 2003 june . using the 850  data",
    ", we find that @xmath46 over this period ; the corresponding value from the 450  data is . taking the 2003 observations only , the 450  and 850data give @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , with a weighted mean of @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "[ dmass ] ) ; for comparison , the maximum mass - loss rate for post - agb stars is @xmath50 ( van winckel 2003 ) .",
    "tyne et al . (",
    "2002 ) used the dusty code ( ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) to fit the @xmath1data with a carbon dust shell and , adjusted for a gas - to - dust ratio of 75 , found that @xmath51 increased from to over the period 1999 may to 2001 september .",
    "our results suggest that the mass - loss from sakurai s object continues to rise .",
    "we have presented 450  and 850  photometry of sakurai s object , and find that the flux densities at both wavelengths have increased steadily over the period 2001 august to 2003 june .",
    "these data , combined with dust temperatures obtained from out ir monitoring programme , lead to a mass - loss in 2003 of @xmath0  , consistent with a continuing rise since our ir observations of 1999 - 2003 .",
