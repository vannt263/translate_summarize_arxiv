    "it is widely accepted that fading is a physical phenomenon that degrades communication signals during wireless propagation .",
    "a common approach for accounting for this effect is to exploit appropriate statistical distributions which are typically known as _",
    "fading models_. as a result , statistical models such as rayleigh , nakagami-@xmath4 , weibull and nakagami - q ( hoyt ) have been shown to be capable of modelling small - scale fading in non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) communication scenarios , whereas the nakagami-@xmath5 ( rice ) distribution has been typically utilized in characterizing multipath fading in line - of - sight ( los ) communication scenarios , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "capitalizing on the these models , m. d. yacoub initially proposed three generalised fading distributions , namely , the @xmath6 , the @xmath7 , the @xmath2 models and subsequently the @xmath3 and the @xmath7 extreme models , @xcite .",
    "these models are distinct thanks to the remarkable flexibility offered by their named parameters which render them capable of providing adequate fitting to experimental data which correspond to realistic communication scenarios .",
    "their usefulness is also evident by the fact that they include as special cases all the aforementioned small - scale fading distributions .",
    "+ however , it is recalled that a crucial aspect of wireless radio propagation is that the occurrence of multipath and shadowing effects is typically simultaneous . as a consequence , in spite of the undoubted usefulness of the aforementioned fading models , they all ultimately fail to account concurrently for both shadowing and multipath fading . in other words , the utilization of the aforementioned fading models is limited to the effective characterisation of either the one or the other effect . based on this principal limitation ,",
    "the need for composite statistical models which are capable of providing efficient characterization of fading `` as a whole '' , became evident @xcite .",
    "+ to this effect , the authors in @xcite proposed the rayleigh / gamma fading model , which is also known as @xmath8-distibution , @xmath9 .",
    "likewise , shankar in @xcite exploited the flexibility of nakagami-@xmath4 distribution , which includes rayleigh distribution as a special case , and introduced the nakagami-@xmath4/gamma composite distribution - or generalised @xmath8-distribution , @xmath10 . in the same context",
    ", the weibull / gamma composite distribution was proposed in @xcite while an introduction to more generalized composite distributions was reported in @xcite .",
    "+ capitalizing on the above , the aim of this work is the formulation and derivation of the @xmath11-@xmath12/gamma , and the @xmath13-@xmath12/gamma composite fading distributions . specifically , after formulating these models , novel analytic expressions are derived for their corresponding envelope probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "the validity of the offered results is justified numerically and their behaviour is examined under different parametric scenarios . thanks to their relatively convenient algebraic representation , the offered results are considered useful mathematical tools that can be efficiently utilized in analytical studies related to the performance of digital communications over @xmath2/gamma and @xmath3/gamma composite fading channels . to this effect , they can be meaningfully exploited in the derivation of analytic expressions for critical performance metrics such as error probability , channel capacity and higher order statistics , among others .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : section ii revisits the basic principles of the @xmath2 , the @xmath3 and the gamma distributions .",
    "sections iii and iv are devoted to the presentation , formulation and derivation of the @xmath2/gamma and @xmath3/gamma fading models , respectively , along with the necessary analysis on their behaviour .",
    "finally , discussions on their potential applicability in wireless communications along with closing remarks are given in section v.",
    "the @xmath2 distribution is a general fading distribution that accounts for the small - scale variation of fading signals in nlos communication scenarios .",
    "it is written in terms of two physical parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; the former corresponds to the ratio of the powers between the multipath waves in the in - phase and quadrature components , whereas the latter is related to the number of multipath clusters in the environment @xcite . for a fading signal with envelope @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the @xmath2 envelope probability density function ( pdf )",
    "is mathematically expressed as    @xmath16\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote expectation and the root - mean - square @xmath19 value of @xmath14 , respectively .",

    ", it is shown that @xcite    @xmath27    equation can be also expressed in a normalized form by considering a normalized envelope @xmath28 .",
    "based on this , the corresponding normalized power pdf can be deduced by setting @xmath29 , namely ,    @xmath30    it is recalled that the @xmath2 model includes as special cases other widely known small - scale fading distributions . more specifically , the hoyt distribution is obtained for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 denotes the nakagami-@xmath34 or hoyt parameter ) .",
    "likewise , the one sided gaussian distribution is attained for @xmath35 or @xmath36 whereas the nakagami-@xmath4 distribution is attained for @xmath37 and @xmath36 or @xmath35 .",

    "the log - normal distribution has been largely considered the optimum statistical model for characterising the shadowing effect , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of its usefulness , it has been largely shown that when it becomes algebraically involved with other elementary and/or special function , its algebraic representation often renders it inconvenient to handle analytically .",
    "this is particularly the case in studies related to the analytical derivation of critical performance measures in digital communications over fading channels .",

    "in addition , its algebraic representation is particularly tractable and therefore , easy to handle both analytically and numerically . as a result",
    ", it has been widely considered a useful model for characterising shadowing effect and based on this , it has been exploited in the formulation of the @xmath8 and @xmath55 composite multipath / shadowing models , @xcite .",
    "according to the basic principles of statistics , the envelope pdf of a composite statistical distribution is constituted by superimposing two or more statistical distributions . in the present case , this is realized by superimposing one multipath and one shadowing distribution , namely ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 denotes the corresponding multipath distribution with mode @xmath58 .",
