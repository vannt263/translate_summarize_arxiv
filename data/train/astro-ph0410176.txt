    "evolutionary models of extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the overwhelming majority of sources with integrated flux densities in excess of @xmath19  mjy are typically identified with active galaxies , energised by accretion onto massive black holes .",
    "these bright sources have a median angular size of 5 - 10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are usually resolved by the vla on arcsecond and sub - arcsecond scales .",
    "often a significant fraction of the total radio emission resides within a compact and unresolved radio `` core '' , with a size measured on milliarcsecond ( mas ) and sub - mas scales using the techniques of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "fainter sub - mjy and microjy radio sources have a higher probability of being energised by , and coextensive with , star formation in galaxies located at moderate redshifts @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that the bulk of these distant systems obey the locally derived ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fir - radio correlation . indeed , only about 20% of the sub - mjy radio source population appears to be optically identified with active galaxies ; a further 10% are optically faint sources with @xmath21 and are difficult to classify from their weak radio emission alone @xcite .",
    "merlin - vla observations of faint radio sources in the hdf show that the microjy radio sources are resolved and typically sub - galactic in their overall extent , with typical measured sizes of 0.2 - 3 arcseconds @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of @xcite , limiting the maximum brightness temperature of star forming galaxies to @xmath22  k at frequencies above 1 ghz .",
    "a recent study conducted by @xcite suggests that a significant fraction of the faint radio source population may be located at high redshift . at the level of 10  @xmath11jy they predict , in their simplest models , source surface densities of 10  deg@xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "however , at these faint sensitivity levels it is increasingly difficult to identify radio - loud active galaxies from the dominant star forming radio source population , especially in the case of optically faint systems .",
    "high - resolution vlbi observations resolve out these extended star forming galaxies and , currently , any compact radio sources in these galaxies , such as luminous type iin sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , would be too faint to detect at cosmological distances .",
    "on the other hand , vlbi is very well matched to detect the very compact radio emission associated with the relativistic outflows generated by accretion onto massive black holes in active galaxies .",
    "high sensitivity vlbi observations , covering a large fraction of sky , thus provide a simple and direct method of identifying these faint , and possibly distant , radio - loud active galaxies .",
    "free from the effects of dust obscuration , deep and wide - field vlbi studies can therefore contribute to the cosmic census of active galaxies ( and their energising massive black holes ) , and together with redshift information , can potentially probe the accretion history of the early universe .",
    "in addition , the positions of the compact vlbi detections can be measured very accurately , via the use of standard phase - referencing techniques .",
    "astrometric precision at the mas level can be achieved routinely , and cross identification with sources detected at other wave - bands can anchor these non - radio observations to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) .",
    "in crowded and deep fields , such precision astrometry may be useful in identifying the counterparts of faint or obscured sources at other wavelengths .",
    "the observations presented here build on earlier wide - field vlbi studies of the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) , conducted by @xcite using the european vlbi network ( evn ) .",
    "unlike traditional snapshot vlbi surveys , the wide - field approach permits many potential targets in the field to be imaged simultaneously , taking full advantage of the sensitivity and the coverage in the _ ( u , v ) _ plane associated with the total duration of the observations and the characteristics of the array . using this observing strategy , it is possible to survey many sources ( as in the case of snapshot observations ) but with much greater sensitivity .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a deep vlbi survey that covers a region of 1017  arcmin@xmath0 @xmath1 0.28  deg@xmath0 , surveying 61 potential sub - mjy and mjy radio source targets at angular resolution ranging from about 10 to 100  mas . for sources located at cosmological distances , the linear resolution corresponding to 10  mas is 90  pc or finer for a _ wmap _ cosmology @xcite .",
    "the vlbi observations and correlation are described in section  [ obs ] , while section  [ cal ] describes the vlbi calibration and imaging .",
    "definition of the vlbi survey fields , survey depths , and target - source selection appear in section  [ sel ] .",
    "results of the vlbi survey are presented in section  [ res ] and discussed in section  [ dis ] .",
    "the paper closes in section  [ fut ] with a synopsis of the future prospects for deep , wide - field vlbi surveys .",
    "observations at 1.4  ghz of a region of the noao - n botes field were made with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) and green bank telescope ( gbt ) , recording at a data rate of 256  mbit  s@xmath7 across a 64-mhz band . for descriptions of the vlba and gbt , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the observations spanned three 8-hour segments on 2002 august 3 , 4 , and 5 ut .",
    "the pointing position for the vlbi array was chosen as @xmath2 14h 29 m 22.0s and @xmath3 @xmath4352850.00 ( j2000 ) and included an area of sky surveyed as part of an earlier vlba snapshot survey of the region @xcite .",
    "in particular , with this pointing position , the compact 20-mjy source j142910.223@xmath4352946.86 fell within the fwhm of the primary beam of all the antennas , including the 100-m gbt .",
    "figure  1 presents the vlba+gbt antenna pointing position and the in - beam calibrator , superimposed upon the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) image of the field described in section [ wsrtsec ] .",
    "a combination of nodding and in - beam phase referencing was employed @xcite , , resulting in an integration time on the target field of 20 hours .",
    "j1426@xmath43625 was used as the conventional phase calibrator and the vlbi astrometry reported in this paper assumes a position for this calibrator of @xmath2 14h 26 m 37.0874939s and @xmath3 @xmath436259.573930 ( j2000 ) in the icrf ( extension 1 ) @xcite .",
    "both the observations and correlation processing assumed a coordinate equinox of 2000 .",
    "two correlation passes were made within the gbt primary beam of fwhm 8.6 .",
    "one correlation pass was centered on the vlba position of the in - beam calibrator j142910.223@xmath4352946.86 given in table  3 .",
    "another correlation pass was centered on @xmath2 14h 29 m 27.0s and @xmath3 @xmath4352830.00 ( j2000 ) , chosen because of the favorable number of potential targets that lay within a radial extent of 2 .",
    "the various vlbi survey fields introduced in section [ sel ] are cast in terms of their radial extents with respect to this correlation phase center .    in order to reduce the effects of bandwidth and time smearing , and thus to image out as large a field of view as possible ,",
    "the vlba correlator generated data with 1024 spectral points per baseline and an integration time of 0.524  s. the vlba station at mauna kea , hi , was omitted from the correlation process , due to the physical limitation on the total output data rate . with a correlator output data rate of 1  mbyte  s@xmath7 , a final data set size of 60  gbytes was realised for each of the two correlator passes .",
    "previous wsrt observations of the botes field @xcite also encompassed the region of sky observed by the vlba+gbt .",
    "in addition , a further 12-hour , 1.4-ghz observation of this particular region of the botes field was conducted @xcite , using the full 160 ( @xmath25 ) mhz wsrt observing band and employing the default continuum frequency set - up ( with the eight bands centered between 1.311 and 1.450 ghz ) .",
    "a short 20-minute scan on 3c  48 was used to initially calibrate the data . for each of the 8 bands ,",
    "64 spectral channels were generated ( a total of 512 spectral points were obtained for the 160 mhz band ) and 4 polarization products were recorded .",
    "the data were calibrated and images generated using the miriad software package @xcite . the @xcite wsrt image of the field , after primary beam correction , is shown in figure  1 . the image reaches a 1 @xmath5 rms noise level of @xmath26jy  beam@xmath7 in this area .",
    "the aips task jmfit was used to determine the positions of regions of radio emission in the wsrt image , as well as their peak flux densities @xmath27 and integrated flux densities @xmath28 .",
    "wsrt sources that met the selection criteria defined in section [ sel ] and table  1 were added to the lists of potential target sources for the vlba+gbt observations ; those lists appear in tables  2 - 7 .",
    "the wsrt astrometry is typically accurate to @xmath29 .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the measured positions of the wsrt sources detected during the vlba+gbt observations ( see tables  2 - 7 ) . in figure  1 , the positions of potential radio source targets for the vlba+gbt observations are indicated by a cross .",
    "the data from the in - beam calibrator pass were edited , averaged , and calibrated in the nrao aips package , and the gain parameters applied to the unaveraged , target - pass data .",
    "the response of the in - beam calibrator was also subtracted from the target _ (",
    "u , v ) _ data .",
    "the aips task imagr was used to make naturally weighted dirty images and beams of the target regions selected from the wsrt image .",
    "targets falling within a certain radial distance were imaged simultaneously using the multi - field option within imagr . given the astrometric accuracy of the wsrt , together with the fact that many of the target sources may have extended radio structures on arcsecond scales , a large possible error between the wsrt and vlbi positions was assumed : each dirty image therefore subtended a square of at least 6 on a side . for each target ,",
    "three such dirty images were made , corresponding to the three epochs of observation .",
    "the three images for each target source were then simply co - added ( averaged ) to form the final target image .",
    "we estimate that the survey analysis required two orders of magnitude more processing power and disk storage requirements than a typical ( single target ) vlbi observation .",
    "the amount of processing power required does not only depend on the data set size ( e.g. 120 gbytes of data for this observation c.f .",
    "@xmath30gbyte for a typical vlbi continnum observation ) but also the number of target images that must be generated ( @xmath31 target images in this experiment c.f .",
    "1 target image for typical vlbi experiments ) .",
    "the largest vlbi images of the targets contained about 400,000 synthesized - beam areas .",
    "hence , the chances of misidentifying a random noise spike as a real detection are significant . in order to avoid spurious detections ,",
    "the dirty images of the target regions were inspected for valid sources using a conservative 6 @xmath5 detection threshold .",
    "most of the sources we detected lie well above this threshold and were therefore bright enough to benefit from the application of the clean deconvolution algorithm .",
    "cleaned images were produced using the aips task apcln .",
    "visibility - based cleaning is currently prohibitively expensive in terms of computing requirements .",
    "we split the survey into 6 separate fields , demarcated by increasing radial distance from the correlation phase center .",
    "these are referred to as the 0 - 2 , 2 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 9 , 9 - 12 , and 12 - 18 survey fields .",
    "we also refer to deep and shallow survey fields . the deep survey fields ( 0 - 2",
    ", 2 - 4 and 4 - 6 ) attains 1 @xmath5 rms noise levels of 9 - 19  @xmath11jy  beam@xmath7 , significantly better than the @xmath32jy  beam@xmath7 for a typical 8-hour vlba observation . the shallow survey field ( 6 - 9 , 9 - 12 and 12 - 18 ) attains 1 @xmath5 rms noise levels of 37 - 55  @xmath11jy  beam@xmath7 , comparable with a typical 8-hour vlba observation .",
    "the measured noise levels are in good agreement with those expected from thermal noise considerations .",
    "our survey attempts to detect sources at large radial distances from the antenna pointing position and the correlation phase center .",
    "the fall - off of the response of the primary beam is one effect that limits the depth of each survey field .",
    "in addition , the effect of employing a restricted _ ( u , v ) _ range in most survey fields , in order to reduce the effect of bandwidth and time smearing , leads to a noise level that also increases with radial distance from the correlation phase center .",
    "in particular , the reduced response in the vlba+gbt images presented here is composed of 4 independent components : the gbt primary beam response ( @xmath33 ) , the vlba primary beam response ( @xmath34 ) and the reduced response due to time and bandwidth smearing effects ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "the combined reduced response , @xmath37 , is given by :    @xmath38    the gbt only contributes to the 0 - 2 and 2 - 4 surveys , due to the sharp fall off of the primary beam response beyond its half - power point .",
    "for the 4 - 6 , 6 - 9 , 9 - 12 , and 12 - 18 survey fields , the reduced response is given by :    @xmath39    we have estimated @xmath35 and @xmath36 following @xcite . for the vlba 25-m antennas ,",
    "a fiducial estimate of the primary beam at fwhm is 29 , but a functional form for the measured primary beam response is not available . since the primary beam response of the vlba 25-m antennas",
    "is expected to be similar to that for the vla 25-m antennas , we have adopted for the vlba antennas the fitted function documented in the aips task pbcor to model the response of the vla primary beam . for the gbt , we have assumed a pure gaussian response ( f.  ghigo , 2004 , private communication ) with a fwhm of 8.6 . in table  1 , we calculate the total response at the outer edge of each of the main survey fields . for the naturally weighted images associated with the inner 0 - 2 and 2 - 4 survey regions , we assume that the longest gbt baseline ( 3326 km to the vlba station at brewster , wa ) , is the appropriate limiting factor for the time and bandwidth smearing response .    for any given region we selected target sources with",
    "measured peak flux densities in the wsrt image , @xmath27 , that satisfied the following constraint :    @xmath40    details of the properties of the various survey fields , including the survey depth , are presented in table  1 .",
    "the quoted survey depth is conservative , in the sense that the value of @xmath37 is determined from the maximum radial extent encompassed by each survey field ; and for the 4 - 6 , 6 - 9 , 9 - 12 , and 12 - 18 fields , from the maximum contributing baseline of the vlbi array .",
    "the deep survey is capable of detecting sub - mjy radio sources over its full extent of 254  arcmin@xmath0 @xmath1 0.07  deg@xmath0 .",
    "the shallower and lower - resolution survey covers an additional 763  arcmin@xmath0 @xmath1 0.21  deg@xmath0 of sky , targeting the brighter sub - mjy and mjy radio sources in the field .",
    "the resolution at fwhm of the deep and shallow surveys range between 7 and 26 mas , and 27 and 115 mas , respectively .",
    "details of the target sources and vlbi detections are presented in tables 2 - 7 for the various deep and shallow fields .",
    "the wsrt flux densities are corrected for primary beam attenuation and the absolute flux density scale is estimated to be better than 2% .",
    "the absolute flux density scale of the vlbi observations are expected to be better than 5% .",
    "the vlbi flux densities have not been corrected for primary beam attenuation , the correction factors scale as @xmath41 as detailed in table 1 for the various survey regions .",
    "we estimate the error in vlbi positions in the 0 - 2 , 2 - 4 & 4 - 6 fields to be set by errors introduced by the ionosphere . with a separation of 1.2between our primary phase reference and the target fields ,",
    "we estimate an error of @xmath42 mas in each coordinate .",
    "in fact we measure a @xmath43  mas offset in each coordinate between the 1.4 ghz position for the in - beam phase reference vlbi j142910.2224 ( target 11 ) presented in this paper , and the 5  ghz position for the same source measured by @xcite .",
    "this offset is consistent with our estimated absolute vlbi position error , given that the source is likely to present slightly different radio source structures at 1.4 and 5  ghz . in the ( heavily tapered ) lower - resolution 6 - 9 , 9 - 12 & 12 - 18 fields , r.m.s .",

    "most of the sources are probably located at moderate redshifts ( @xmath103 ) but the non - detection of two objects in k - band and one object in both i and k - band , suggests some significant fraction of these faint , compact sources may be located at @xmath104 .",
    "our observations suggests that the percentage of mjy and sub - mjy radio sources that are powered by black - hole accretion processes in this botes field is , at least , 15@xmath1055% .",
    "only 3 _ sub - mjy _ wsrt sources ( vlbi j142934.7033 , j143002.5631 , and j142835.5389 ) are detected out of a total of 40 potential _ sub - mjy _ targets , implying a detection rate of 8@xmath17% .",
    "the detection rate is higher for _ mjy _ wsrt sources : 6 sources are detected out of a total of 21 potential _",
    "targets , for a detection rate of 29@xmath18% .",
    "the disappointing detection rate in the sub - mjy radio source population serves to reinforce the rapid evolution that is believed to be taking place in the radio source population at these faint mjy and sub - mjy flux density levels @xcite .",
    "however , the detection rate reported here is probably further affected by resolution effects .",
    "several of the sub - mjy sources in our sample are likely to be partially , rather than fully resolved . in these cases ,",
    "compact structure associated with an active nucleus may be missed by our survey if it falls below our 6 @xmath5 detection threshold",
    ". our detection rate of about 8% for sub - mjy sources is , therefore , very much a lower - limit on the fraction of sub - mjy sources with active nuclei .",
    "the morphology of the sources detected also confirms previously observed trends for brighter sources to exhibit radio structure on much larger scales than fainter sources .",
    "this can be understood in terms of synchrotron - self - absorption theory , wherein the overall radio source size is proportional to the square root of the peak flux density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "evn observations of the hdf - n @xcite , plus the new vlba+gbt vlbi observations presented here , demonstrate that deep , wide - field vlbi surveys can now be conducted on largely random areas of sky . in particular , at the single - figure r.m.s .",
    "noise levels demonstrated here , many sources can be detected simultaneously within the primary beam of individual vlbi antennas .",
    "this opens up the possibility of embarking on large - area , unbiased , high - resolution surveys of the sub - mjy and mjy radio source population .",
    "in addition , at frequencies of a few ghz , the combined response of the sources detected in such wide - field analyses should always be sufficient to permit self - calibration techniques to be utilized , irrespective of where the vlbi antennas are pointing .",
    "further important technical developments in this field are imminent .",
    "fast data output rates are being implemented in the evn correlator at jive and will permit wide - field , global vlbi studies to be conducted with reduced losses associated with time and bandwidth smearing .",
    "the resulting data sets will be extrememly large , typically @xmath106terrabyte .",
    "fortunately the basic calibration data ( e.g. phase corrections via external calibrators ) will be possible via averaged ( smaller ) data sets .",
    "the full - beam calibration technique however , requires processing of the full ( un - averaged ) data set and would currently require the data to be split - up into smaller chunks ( time - ranges ) and the self - calibration process spread over multiple computer processors .",
    "a similar requirement is necessary for target imaging , though in this case the data can be split - up both in the time & frequency domain .",
    "such parallel data processing is well - suited to emerging computer hardware , such as linux - based pc clusters .",
    "these developments , together with the wide - spread adoption of the mark  5 recording system by the major vlbi networks @xcite , should permit global , wide - field surveys to reach 1 @xmath5 rms noise levels of @xmath107jy  beam@xmath7 . at these levels of sensitivity , a much more comprehensive census of active galaxies associated with sub - mjy",
    "radio sources will be possible , including studies of the optically faint microjy radio source population . at microjy noise levels ,",
    "radio - loud active galaxies are detectable at the very earliest cosmic epochs , when the first active galaxies and their energising massive black holes began to form . certainly with these new capabilities in place",
    ", it will be very interesting to see if the apparent low detection rate of sub - mjy radio sources continues to be observed at @xmath107jy  beam@xmath7 noise levels .",
    "such an effect might be expected if black holes less massive than @xmath108m@xmath109 are rare and/or produce less radio emission than more massive systems @xcite .",
