    "in two - dimensional electron systems , the electrons are confined to move in a plane in the presence of a random potential . according to the scaling theory of localization ( abrahams  1979 ) ,",
    "these systems lie on the boundary between high and low dimensions insofar as the metal - insulator transition is concerned .",
    "the carriers are always strongly localized in one dimension , while in three dimensions , the electronic states can be either localized or extended . in the case of two dimensions the electrons may conduct well at room temperature , but a weak logarithmic increase of the resistance is expected as the temperature is reduced .",
    "this is due to the fact that , when scattered from impurities back to their starting point , electron waves interfere constructively with their time reversed paths . while this effect is weak at high temperatures due to inelastic scattering events , quantum interference becomes increasingly important as the temperature is reduced and leads to localization of the electrons , albeit on a large length scale ; this is generally referred to as `` weak localization '' . indeed ,",
    "thin metallic films and two - dimensional electron systems fabricated on semiconductor surfaces were found to display the predicted logarithmic increase of resistivity ( dolan and osheroff 1979 ; bishop  1980 , 1982 ; uren  1980 ) , providing support for the weak localization theory .",
    "the scaling theory does not explicitly consider the effect of the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "the strength of the interactions is usually characterized by the dimensionless wigner - seitz radius , @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 is the electron density and @xmath2 is the bohr radius in a semiconductor ) . in the experiments mentioned above , the coulomb interactions are relatively weak .",
    "indeed , these experiments are in agreement with theoretical predictions ( altshuler , aronov and lee 1980 ) that weak electron - electron interactions ( @xmath3 ) increase the localization even further .",
    "as the density of electrons is reduced , however , the wigner - seitz radius grows and the interactions provide the dominant energy of the system .",
    "no analytical theory has been developed to date in the strongly - interacting limit ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "finkelstein ( 1983 , 1984 ) and castellani  ( 1984 ) predicted that for weak disorder and sufficiently strong interactions , a 2d system should scale towards a _ conducting _ state as the temperature is lowered .",
    "however , the scaling procedure leads to an increase in the effective strength of the interactions and to a divergent spin susceptibility , so that the perturbative approach breaks down as the temperature is reduced toward zero .",
    "therefore , the possibility of a 2d metallic ground state stabilized by strong electron - electron interactions was not seriously considered .",
    "recent progress in semiconductor technology has enabled the fabrication of high quality 2d samples with very low randomness in which measurements can be made at very low carrier densities . the strongly - interacting regime ( @xmath4 )",
    "has thus become experimentally accessible .",
    "experiments on low - disordered 2d silicon samples ( kravchenko  1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) demonstrated that there are surprising and dramatic differences between the behaviour of strongly interacting systems at @xmath5 as compared with weakly - interacting systems : with increasing electron density , one can cross from the regime where the resistance diverges with decreasing temperature ( insulating behaviour ) to a regime where the resistance decreases strongly with decreasing @xmath6 ( metallic behaviour ) .",
    "these results were met with great scepticism and largely overlooked until 1997 , when they were confirmed in silicon mosfets from a different source ( popovi  1997 ) and in other strongly - interacting 2d systems ( coleridge  1997 ; hanein  1998a ; papadakis and shayegan 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , it was found ( simonian  1997b ; pudalov  1997 ; simmons  1998 ) that in the strongly - interacting regime , an external magnetic field strong enough to polarize the electrons spins induces a giant positive in - plane magnetoresistance and completely suppresses the metallic behaviour , thus implying that the spin state is central to the high conductance of the metallic state .",
    "this finding was in qualitative agreement with the prediction of finkelstein and castellani  that for spin - polarized electrons , only an insulating ground state is possible in a disordered 2d system even in the presence of strong interactions .",
    "subsequent experiments ( okamoto  1999 ; kravchenko  2000b ; shashkin  2001 , 2002 ; vitkalov  2001b , 2002 ; pudalov  2002b ; zhu  2003 ) have shown that there is a sharp enhancement of the spin susceptibility as the metal - insulator transition is approached ; indications exist that in silicon mosfets , the spin susceptibility may actually diverge at some sample - independent electron density @xmath7  @xmath8 .    in silicon samples with very low disorder potential , the critical density for the metal - insulator transition",
    "was found to be at or very near @xmath9 ( shashkin  2001a , 2002 ; vitkalov  2001b , 2002 ) , indicating that the metal - insulator transition observed in these samples is a property of a clean disorder - free 2d system , rather than being a disorder - driven transition . in such samples ,",
    "the metallic and insulating regimes are divided by a temperature - independent separatrix with @xmath10 , in the vicinity of which the resistivity displays virtually universal critical behaviour . however , in samples with relatively strong disorder , the electrons become localized at densities significantly higher than @xmath9 : from @xmath11 to @xmath12  @xmath8 ( prus  2002 ) , and even as high as @xmath13  @xmath8 ( pudalov  1999 ) , indicating that the localization transition in these samples is driven by disorder .",
    "we suggest that there has been a great deal of confusion and controversy caused by the fact that often no distinction has been made between results obtained in systems with relatively high disorder and those obtained for very clean samples , and also because in many experimental studies , a change in the sign of the derivative @xmath14 has always been assumed to signal a metal - insulator transition . in this review ,",
    "we focus our attention on results for very clean samples .",
    "the experimental findings described above were quite unexpected .",
    "once accepted , they elicited strong and widespread interest among theorists , with proposed explanations that included unusual superconductivity ( phillips  1998 ) , charging / discharging of contaminations in the oxide ( altshuler and maslov 1999 ) , the formation of a disordered wigner solid ( chakravarty  1999 ) , inter - subband scattering ( yaish  2000 ) and many more ( for a review , see abrahams , kravchenko and sarachik 2001 ) .",
    "it is now well - documented that the metallic behaviour in zero magnetic field is caused by the delocalizing effect associated with strong electron - electron interactions which overpower quantum localization . in the `` ballistic regime ''",
    "deep in the metallic state , the conductivity is linear with temperature and derives from coherent scattering of electrons by friedel oscillations ( zala , narozhny and aleiner 2001 ) .",
    "closer to the transition , in the `` diffusive '' regime , the temperature dependence of the resistance is well described by a renormalization group analysis of the interplay of strong interactions and disorder ( punnoose and finkelstein 2002 ) . within both theories ( which consider essentially two limits of the same physical process ) an external magnetic field quenches the delocalizing effect of interactions by aligning the spins , and causes a giant positive magnetoresistance .",
    "however , the metal - insulator transition itself , as well as the dramatic increase of the spin susceptibility and effective mass in its close vicinity , still lack adequate theoretical description ; in this region the system appears to behave well beyond a weakly interacting fermi liquid .",
    "in the next three sections , we describe the main experimental results that demonstrate the unexpected presence of a metallic phase in 2d and present an overview of recent experiments with emphasis on the anomalous magnetic properties observed in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the first experiments that demonstrated the unusual temperature dependence of the resistivity ( kravchenko  1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) were performed on low - disordered silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) with maximum electron mobilities reaching more than @xmath15  @xmath16/vs , mobilities that were considerably higher than in samples used in earlier investigations .",
    "it was the very high quality of the samples that allowed access to the physics at electron densities below @xmath17  @xmath8 .",
    "at these low densities , the coulomb energy , @xmath18 , is the dominant parameter .",
    "estimates for si mosfets at @xmath19  @xmath8 yield @xmath20  mev , while the fermi energy , @xmath21 , is about @xmath22  mev ( a valley degeneracy of two is taken into account when calculating the fermi energy , and the effective mass is assumed to be equal to the band mass , @xmath23 . ) the ratio between the coulomb and fermi energies , @xmath24 , thus assumes values above 10 in these samples .    figure  [ r(t)first ]  ( a ) shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity measured in units of @xmath25 of a high - mobility mosfet for 30 different electron densities @xmath1 varying from @xmath26 to @xmath27  @xmath8 . if the resistivity at high temperatures exceeds the quantum resistance @xmath25 ( the curves above the dashed red line ) , @xmath28 increases monotonically as the temperature decreases , behaviour that is characteristic of an insulator . however , for @xmath1 above a certain `` critical '' value , @xmath29 ( the curves below the `` critical '' curve that extrapolates to @xmath30 denoted in red ) , the temperature dependence of @xmath28 becomes non - monotonic : with decreasing temperature , the resistivity first increases ( at @xmath31  k ) and then starts to decrease . at",
    "yet higher density @xmath1 , the resistivity is almost constant at @xmath32  k but drops by an order of magnitude at lower temperatures , showing strongly metallic behaviour as @xmath33 .",
    "a striking feature of the @xmath28 curves shown in figure  [ r(t)first ]  ( a ) for different @xmath1 is that they can be made to overlap by applying a ( density - dependent ) scale factor along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "thus , the resistivity can be expressed as a function of @xmath34 with @xmath35 depending only on @xmath1 .",
    "this was demonstrated for several samples over a rather wide range of electron densities ( typically @xmath36  @xmath8 ) ) and in the temperature interval 0.2 to 2  k. the results of this scaling are shown in fig .",
    "[ r(t)first ]  ( b ) , where @xmath37 is plotted as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "one can see that the data collapse onto two separate branches , the upper one for the insulating side of the transition and the lower one for the metallic side . the thickness of the lines is largely governed by the noise within a given data set , attesting to the high quality of the scaling .",
    "the procedure used to bring about the collapse and determine @xmath35 for each @xmath1 was the following .",
    "no power law dependence was assumed _ a priori _ for @xmath35 versus @xmath38 ; instead , the @xmath28 curves were successively scaled along the @xmath6-axis to coincide : the second `` insulating '' curve from the top was scaled along the @xmath6-axis to coincide with the top - most curve and the corresponding scaling factor was recorded , then the third , and so on , yielding the upper curve in fig .  [ r(t)first ]  ( b ) ( designated by open symbols ) . the same procedure was applied on the metallic side of the transition starting with the highest - density curve , giving the lower curve in fig .",
    "[ r(t)first ]  ( b ) ( shown as closed symbols ) .",
    "a quantitative value was assigned to the scaling factor to obtain @xmath35 for the insulating curves by using the fact that the resistivity of the most insulating ( lowest @xmath1 ) curve was shown ( mason  , 1995 ) to exhibit the temperature dependence characteristic of hopping in the presence of a coulomb gap : @xmath39exp@xmath40 $ ] ( efros and shklovskii 1975 ) .",
    "@xmath35 was determined on the metallic side using the symmetry between metallic and insulating curves , as described in more detail in kravchenko  ( 1995 ) . for all samples",
    "studied , this scaling procedure yields a power law dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath41 on both sides of the transition : @xmath42 with the average power @xmath43 for the insulating side and @xmath44 for the metallic side of the transition ; this common power law can be clearly seen in the inset to fig .",
    "[ r(t)first ]  ( b ) , where for each sample the open ( insulating side ) and filled ( metallic side ) symbols form a single line . the same power law was later observed by popovi ( 1997 ) in silicon samples from another source , thus establishing its universality and supporting the validity of the scaling analysis .",
    "simonian  ( 1997a ) noted that the metallic and insulating curves are reflection - symmetric in the temperature range between approximately 300  mk and 2  k. in fig .",
    "[ duality ]  ( a ) , the normalized resistivity , @xmath45 , is shown as a function of the gate voltage , @xmath46 , together with the normalized conductivity , @xmath47 ; the apparent symmetry about the vertical line corresponding to the critical electron density can be clearly seen .",
    "[ duality ]  ( b ) demonstrates that the curves can be mapped onto each other by reflection , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath48 is virtually identical to @xmath49 .",
    "this mapping holds over a range of temperature from @xmath50  k to @xmath51  k ; however , the range @xmath52 over which it holds decreases as the temperature is decreased : for example , at @xmath53  k , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are symmetric for @xmath56 , while at @xmath57  k , they are symmetric only for @xmath58 ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ duality ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "similar symmetry was later reported by popovi  ( 1997 ) and simmons  ( 1998 ) .",
    "this implies that there is a simple relation between the mechanism for conduction on opposite sides in the vicinity of the transition ; the data bear a strong resemblance to the behaviour found by shahar  ( 1996 ) for the resistivity near the transition between the quantum hall liquid and insulator , where it has been attributed to charge - flux duality in the composite boson description .",
    "it was argued by dobrosavljevi  ( 1997 ) that both the scaling and reflection symmetry are consequences of a simple analysis assuming that a @xmath59 quantum critical point describes the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath28 is very similar for clean silicon mosfets . as an example , fig .",
    "[ r(t)universal ] shows the resistivity as a function of temperature of three low - disordered samples obtained from different sources .",
    "the behaviour is quantitatively similar in the critical region in the vicinity of the `` separatrix '' , which is the horizontal curve for which the resistivity is independent of temperature . in all samples ,",
    "the separatrix is remarkably flat at temperatures below 1  k  k , the resistivity of the separatrix slowly decreases with increasing temperature , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ r(t)first ] , where @xmath28 curves are shown in a much wider temperature interval . ] , and the resistivity is essentially the same numerically at slightly less than @xmath30 . the curves below the separatrix exhibit strongly metallic temperature dependence ( @xmath60 ) with no low-@xmath6 saturation down to the lowest temperature ( @xmath61  mk or lower ; see fig.[r(t)universal ]  ( b ) ) ; the drop in resistivity reaches as much as a factor of 10 for the bottom curve in fig.[r(t)universal ]  ( a ) .",
    "alternative methods used to determine the critical electron density in low - disordered samples yield the same value as the density for the separatrix ( see sec .",
    "[ n_c ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the separatrix in ultra - clean samples represents the `` upper limit '' of the resistivity for which metallic behaviour ( as characterized by @xmath60 ) can exist : metallic @xmath28 has never been observed in any 2d samples at resistivities above @xmath62 , in quantitative agreement with the predictions of the renormalization group theory ( see sec.[sec : rg ] ) .    in more disordered samples ,",
    "however , the behaviour of the resistivity is very different .",
    "even though the @xmath63 isotherms apparently cross at some electron density ( see the inset to fig.[pudalov2001dirty ] ) , the temperature dependence of the resistivity does not resemble the critical behaviour seen in low - disordered samples .",
    "an example of @xmath28 curves in a disordered sample is shown in fig.[pudalov2001dirty ] .",
    "the sample is insulating at electron densities up to @xmath64  @xmath8 which is an order of magnitude higher than the critical density in low - disordered samples .",
    "the metallic temperature dependence of the resistance visible at higher @xmath1 does not exceed a few percent ( compared to a factor of 10 in low - disordered samples ) .",
    "most importantly , the density corresponding to the crossing point shown in the inset to fig.[pudalov2001dirty ] does not coincide with the critical density determined by other methods discussed in the next subsection .",
    "a metal - insulator transition similar to that seen in clean silicon mosfets has also been observed in other low - disordered , strongly - interacting 2d systems : @xmath65-type sige heterostructures ( coleridge  1997 ) , gaas / algaas heterostructures ( hanein  1998a ; yoon  1999 ; mills  1999 ; noh  2002 and others ) and alas heterostructures ( papadakis and shayegan 1998 ) .",
    "it is difficult to make a direct comparison of the resistivity observed in different material systems because the temperature scales are different , since the coulomb and fermi energies depend on the effective mass and carrier density .",
    "for example , the characteristic temperature below which the metallic decrease in the resistivity occurs in @xmath65-type gaas / algaas samples is about ten times smaller than in silicon mosfets . on the other hand ,",
    "the values of the resistivity are quite similar in the two systems . in fig .",
    "[ r(t)gaas ] , the resistivity is plotted as a function of temperature for two @xmath65-type gaas / algaas samples produced using different technologies .",
    "the data shown in the left hand panel were obtained by hanein  ( 1998a ) for an inverted semiconductor - insulator - semiconductor ( isis ) structure with maximum mobility of @xmath66  @xmath67vs , while the right - hand panel shows @xmath28 measured by yoon  ( 1999 ) on a @xmath65-type gaas / algaas heterostructure with peak mobility by a factor of five higher ( @xmath68  @xmath69/vs ) .",
    "the interaction parameter , @xmath70 , changes between approximately 12 and 32 for the left hand plot and from 16 to 44 for the right hand plot values were calculated assuming that the effective mass is independent of density and equal to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the free - electron mass . ] . in spite of the difference in the sample quality and range of densities , the dependence of @xmath28 on temperature is almost the same for the two samples .",
    "the main features are very similar to those found in silicon mosfets : when the resistivity at `` high '' temperatures exceeds the quantum resistance , @xmath25 ( _ i.e. _ , at hole densities below some critical value , @xmath73 ) , the @xmath28 curves are insulating - like in the entire temperature range ; for densities just above @xmath73 , the resistivity shows insulating - like behaviour at higher temperatures and then drops by a factor of 2 to 3 at temperatures below a few hundred mk ; and at yet higher hole densities , the resistivity is metallic in the entire temperature range .",
    "note that the curves that separate metallic and insulating behaviour have resistivities that increase with decreasing temperature at the higher temperatures shown ; this is quite similar to the behaviour of the separatrix in silicon mosfets when viewed over a broad temperature range ( see fig .",
    "[ r(t)first ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "however , below approximately 150  mk , the separatrix in @xmath65-type gaas / algaas heterostructures is independent of temperature ( hanein  , 1998b ) , as it is in si mosfets below approximately 2  k. the resistivity of the separatrix in both systems extrapolates to @xmath74 as @xmath33 , even though the corresponding carrier densities are very different .    as in the case of highly disordered silicon mosfets , no critical behaviour of resistance",
    "is observed in disordered gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ simmons2000dirty ] where the temperature dependence of the resistivity at @xmath75 is plotted for hole densities @xmath76 @xmath8 .",
    "monotonic localized behaviour is observed even when the `` high - temperature '' resistivity lies well below @xmath25 , at carrier densities up to @xmath77  @xmath8 ; both samples shown in the previous figure would be in the deeply metallic regime at this hole density . above this density ,",
    "the decrease in resistivity with decreasing temperature is very small ( about 10% in the temperature interval 0.7 to 0.1  k ) .",
    "as indicated by the experimental results presented above , the @xmath28 curves are nearly universal in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition , but only in samples with very weak disorder potential .",
    "the strength of the disorder is usually characterized by the maximum carrier mobility , @xmath78 . in general , the higher the maximum mobility ( _ i.e_.  the lower the disorder ) , the lower the carrier density at which the localization transition occurs .",
    "this was shown empirically by sarachik ( 2002 ) to hold over a broad range ( five decades in density ) for all materials studied : the critical density follows a power law dependence on peak mobility ( or scattering rate ) . however , the data exhibit some scatter , and the correlation is not exact .",
    "thus , for example , the peak hole mobilities in samples used by hanein  ( 1998a ) and simmons  ( 1998 ) are similar , while the localization transition occurs in the latter at a value of @xmath65 several times higher than the former . this may be due to sample imperfections ( _ e.g. _ , a slightly inhomogeneous density distribution ) , which are important at low carrier densities , while the maximum mobility is reached at relatively high carrier densities and may therefore be relatively insensitive to such effects .",
    "a better indicator of the strength of the disorder potential near the mit is how low the carrier density is at which the localization transition occurs . in silicon mosfets ,",
    "the experimental results obtained to date suggest that the resistivity near the transition approaches universal behaviour for samples in which the transition to a strongly localized state occurs at @xmath79  @xmath8 .",
    "( in @xmath65-type gaas / algaas heterostructures , the corresponding density separating universal and non - universal behaviour appears to be about an order of magnitude lower , although the data are currently insufficient to determine the value reliably . ) below , we will argue that the `` universal '' metal - insulator transition in very clean samples is not driven by disorder but by some other mechanism , possibly of magnetic origin .",
    "in contrast , the transition is not universal in more disordered samples and is presumably due to anderson localization , which is strong enough to overpower the metallic behaviour at low densities .      to verify whether or not the separatrix corresponds to the critical density ,",
    "an independent determination of the critical point is necessary : comparison of values obtained using different criteria provides an experimental test of whether or not a true mit exists at @xmath75 .",
    "one obvious criterion , hereafter referred to as the `` derivative criterion '' , is a change in sign of the temperature derivative of the resistivity , @xmath80 ; this is the criterion often used to identify the mit .",
    "a positive ( negative ) sign of the derivative at the lowest achievable temperatures is empirically associated with a metallic ( insulating ) phase .",
    "a weakness of this criterion is that it requires extrapolation to zero temperature .",
    "a second criterion can be applied based on an analysis of a temperature - independent characteristic , namely , the localisation length @xmath81 extrapolated from the insulating phase .",
    "these two methods have been applied to low - disordered silicon mosfets by shashkin  ( 2001b ) and jaroszyski  ( 2002 ) .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the temperature dependence of the resistance deep in the insulating phase obeys the efros - shklovskii variable - range hopping form ( mason  1995 ) ; on the other hand , closer to the critical electron density at temperatures that are not too low , the resistance has an activated form @xmath82 ( pepper  1974 ; pudalov  1993 ; shashkin  1994 ) due to thermal activation to the mobility edge . fig .",
    "[ mobility_edge ] shows the activation energy @xmath83 as a function of the electron density ( diamonds ) ; the data can be approximated by a linear function which yields , within the experimental uncertainty , the same critical electron density as the `` derivative criterion '' .",
    "the critical density can also be determined by studying the nonlinear current - voltage @xmath84 characteristics on the insulating side of the transition .",
    "a typical low - temperature @xmath84 curve is close to a step - like function : the voltage rises abruptly at low current and then saturates , as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ mobility_edge ] ; the magnitude of the step is @xmath85 .",
    "the curve becomes less sharp at higher temperatures , yet the threshold voltage , @xmath86 , remains essentially unchanged .",
    "closer to the mit , the threshold voltage decreases , and at @xmath87  @xmath8 , the @xmath84 curve is strictly linear ( shashkin  2001b ) . according to polyakov and shklovskii ( 1993 ) and shashkin  ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the breakdown of the localized phase occurs when the localized electrons at the fermi level gain enough energy to reach the mobility edge in an electric field , @xmath88 , over a distance given by the localization length , @xmath81 , which is temperature - independent : @xmath89 ( here @xmath90 is the distance between the potential probes ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath91 near the mit is linear , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mobility_edge ] by closed circles , and its extrapolation to zero threshold value again yields approximately the same critical electron density as the two previous criteria .",
    "the linear dependence @xmath91 , accompanied by linear @xmath92 , signals the localization length diverging near the critical density : @xmath93 .",
    "these experiments indicate that in low - disordered samples , the two methods  one based on extrapolation of @xmath28 to zero temperature and a second based on the behaviour of the temperature - independent localization length  give the same critical electron density : @xmath94 .",
    "this implies that the separatrix remains `` flat '' ( or extrapolates to a finite resistivity ) at zero temperature .",
    "since one of the methods is independent of temperature , this equivalence supports the existence of a true @xmath59 mit in low - disordered samples in zero magnetic field .    in contrast , we note that in highly - disordered samples , the localization length method yields a critical density noticeably lower than the derivative criterion .",

    "@xmath96 changes sign at electron density @xmath97  @xmath8 .",
    "the activation energy , however , vanishes at @xmath98  @xmath8 , which is more than a factor of two lower than @xmath99 : at densities between these two values , the resistivity does not diverge as @xmath33 , even though it exhibits an insulating - like temperature dependence .",
    "thus , these two different methods yield different `` critical densities '' for a sample with strong disorder .",
    "moreover , from the study of low - frequency resistance noise in dilute silicon mosfets , bogdanovich and popovi ( 2002 ) and jaroszyski  ( 2002 ) have found that the behaviour of several spectral characteristics indicates a dramatic slowing down of the electron dynamics at a well - defined electron density @xmath100 , which they have interpreted as an indication of a ( glassy ) freezing of the 2d electron system . in low - disordered samples",

    "the interaction parameter , @xmath24 , is generally assumed to be equal to the dimensionless wigner - seitz radius , @xmath226 , and , hence , proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "however , this is true only if the effective mass does not depend on @xmath1 ; close to the transition , where the effective mass is strongly enhanced , the deviations from the square root law become important , and the interaction parameter is larger than the wigner - seitz radius by a factor of @xmath222 ( or @xmath227 in silicon mosfets , where an additional factor of 2 derives from the valley degeneracy ) .    near the metal - insulator transition , @xmath203 grows rapidly due to the sharp increase of the effective mass , as shown on the upper @xmath228-axis in figure  [ m ] ; here @xmath203 is calculated using the effective mass obtained from the analysis of the sdh oscillations .",
    "we note that since at low @xmath1 this method yields a somewhat smaller effective mass than the method based on the analysis of @xmath151 , the plotted values represent the most conservative estimate for @xmath203 . due to the rapid increase of @xmath146 near the transition ,",
    "even small changes in the electron density may lead to large changes in @xmath203 .",
    "for example , the transition to a localized state in a low - disordered sample used by shashkin  ( 2001b ) occurs at @xmath229  @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ r(t)inb_ours ] ) , while in a sample of lesser quality used by prus  ( 2002 ) , it occurs at @xmath230  @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ reznikov_r(t ) ] ) .",
    "the areas corresponding to the metallic regimes studied in these papers are shaded in fig .",
    "[ m ] ; the corresponding values of @xmath203 differ dramatically ( the actual values of @xmath203 in the study by shashkin  are not known because the effective mass has not been determined near the transition ; the lower boundary for @xmath203 is 50 ) .",
    "the difference in @xmath203 may account for the qualitative change in the behaviour of the resistance in the two samples : in the more disordered sample , there is no temperature - independent curve ( the separatrix ) , and some of the curves which look `` metallic '' at higher temperature are insulating below a few hundred mk , suggesting that localization becomes dominant in this sample as @xmath33 .",
    "the possibility that a @xmath75 metallic state in 2d can be stabilized by interactions was first suggested by finkelstein ( 1983 , 1984 ) and castellani  ( 1984 ) . in this theory ,",
    "the combined effects of disorder and interactions were studied by perturbative renormalization group methods .",
    "it was found that as the temperature is decreased , the resistivity increases and then decreases at lower temperatures , suggesting that the system is approaching a low - temperature metallic state .",
    "an external magnetic field , via zeeman splitting , drives the system back to the insulating state .",
    "these predictions of the theory are in qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "however , an interaction parameter scales to infinitely large values before zero temperature is reached , and the theory thus becomes uncontrolled ; this scenario has consequently not received general acceptance .",
    "it should also be noted that the theory may not be applicable to the current experiments since it was developed for the diffusive regime : @xmath231 , where @xmath109 is the elastic mean - free time extracted from the drude conductivity ( boltzmann constant is assumed to be equal to 1 throughout this section ) .",
    "this condition corresponds to the low - temperature limit @xmath232 .",
    "since the fermi temperature , @xmath233 , is rather low at the small carrier densities considered here , the above condition is satisfied only close to the transition , where @xmath37 becomes of the order of @xmath25 . in the experiments , however , the characteristic decrease of the resistance with decreasing temperature often persists into the relatively high - temperature _ ballistic _ regime @xmath234 ( or @xmath235 ) .",
    "altshuler  ( 2001 ) and brunthaler  ( 2001 ) have interpreted this observation as evidence that the mechanism responsible for the strong temperature dependence can not originate from quantum interference .    for the ballistic region ,",
    "calculations in the random phase approximation were carried out two decades ago by stern ( 1980 ) , gold and dolgopolov ( 1986 ) , das  sarma ( 1986 ) and were recently refined by das  sarma and hwang ( 1999 ) .",
    "these theories predict a linear temperature dependence for the conductivity with metallic - like slope ( @xmath236 ) regardless of the strength of the interactions .",
    "the spin degree of freedom is not important in this theory and enters only through the fermi energy , which is a factor of two larger for the spin - polarized than for the unpolarized system .",
    "therefore , the application of a ( parallel ) magnetic field does not eliminate the metallic temperature dependence .    the two limits  diffusive and ballistic ",
    "had until recently been assumed to be governed by different physical processes .",
    "however , zala  ( 2001 ) have shown that the temperature dependence of the conductivity in the ballistic regime originates from the same physical process as the altshuler - aronov - lee corrections : coherent scattering of electrons by friedel oscillations . in this regime",
    "the correction is linear in temperature , as is the case for the results mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , the value and even the _ sign _ of the slope depends on the strength of electron - electron interaction , the slope being directly related to the renormalization of the spin susceptibility ( see also gold 2001 , 2003 ) . by aligning the spins , a magnetic field causes a positive magnetoresistance and changes the temperature dependence of the conductivity from metallic - like to insulating - like ( herbut 2001 ; zala  2002 ; gold 2003 ) , in agreement with experiments .",
    "it is well known that in the diffusive limit ( @xmath237 ) , electron - electron interactions in two dimensional disordered systems lead to logarithmically divergent corrections to the conductivity given by : @xmath238,\\ ] ] where @xmath239 is the interaction constant in the triplet channel which depends on the interaction strength .",
    "the sign of this logarithmically divergent correction may be positive ( metallic - like ) or negative ( insulating - like ) , depending on the value of @xmath239 .",
    "experimentally , the diffusive regime is realized in a relatively narrow range of electron densities near the metal - insulator transition , where the resistivity is of the order of @xmath25 .",
    "punnoose and finkelstein ( 2002 ) have convincingly demonstrated that in this region , the temperature dependence of the resistivity can be understood within the renormalization group theory describing the effect of the electron - electron interactions on the propagation of diffusive collective modes , with the _ delocalizing _ component becoming dominant in dilute 2d systems .    in 2d ,",
    "the renormalization group equation describing the evolution of the resistivity has been derived previously by finkelstein : @xmath240~. \\label{eqn:1-val - g}\\ ] ] here @xmath241 , the dimensionless parameter @xmath185 is the conductance in units of @xmath242 and @xmath243 is the coupling constant . the first term in the square brackets of eq .",
    "[ eqn:1-val - g ] corresponds to the weak localization correction ( quantum interference ; abrahams  1979 ) , while the second term is the contribution of the singlet density mode which is due to the long range nature of the coulomb interaction ( altshuler , aronov and lee 1980 ) .",
    "the last term describes the contribution of the three triplet modes .",
    "note that the last two terms have opposite signs , favouring localization and delocalization , respectively .",
    "the resulting dependence @xmath244 becomes delocalizing when @xmath245 .",
    "this requires the presence of rather strong electron correlations .    in the case of two distinct valleys ( as in ( 100 ) silicon mosfets ) , eq .",
    "[ eqn:1-val - g ] can be easily generalized to : @xmath246~. \\label{eqn:2-val - g}\\ ] ] the difference between the numerical factors in eq .",
    "[ eqn:1-val - g ] and eq .",
    "[ eqn:2-val - g ] results from the number of degrees of freedom in each case .",
    "the weak localization term becomes twice as large .",
    "the difference in the number of the multiplet modes increases the coefficient of the @xmath247 term from @xmath248 to @xmath249 . as a result of these modifications ,",
    "the value of @xmath247 required for the dependence @xmath250 to become delocalizing is reduced to @xmath251 which makes it easier in the case of two valleys to reach the condition where the resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature .    in conventional conductors",
    "the initial values of @xmath247 are small , and the net effect is in favour of localization . in dilute systems , however , this value is enhanced due to electron - electron correlations .",
    "in addition , @xmath247 also experiences logarithmic corrections due to the disorder ( finkelstein 1983 , 1984 ; castellani  1984 , 1998 ) .",
    "the equation describing the renormalization group evolution of @xmath247 is the same for the case of one and two valleys : @xmath252 it follows from this equation that @xmath247 increases monotonically as the temperature is decreased .",
    "once it exceeds @xmath253 , the resistivity passes through a maximum .",
    "even though the initial values of @xmath185 and @xmath247 are not universal , the flow of @xmath185 can be described by a universal function @xmath254 ( finkelstein , 1983 ) : @xmath255 where @xmath140 is the temperature at which @xmath185 reaches its maximum value @xmath256 .    in fig .",
    "[ punnoose ] , the theoretical calculations are compared with the experimental data obtained by pudalov  ( 1998 ) . since the renormalization group equations were derived in the lowest order in @xmath185 and can not be applied in the critical region where @xmath257 , only curves with maximum @xmath185 ranging from @xmath258 to @xmath259 are shown in the figure .",
    "the decrease in the resistivity by up to a factor of five , as well as its saturation , are both captured in the correct temperature interval by this analysis without any adjustable parameters .    in agreement with experiment ,",
    "this universal behaviour can be observed only in ultra clean samples ( with negligible inter - valley scattering ) and will not be found in samples that are only moderately clean . in disordered silicon mosfets , a description in terms of an effective _ single _ valley is relevant , and the large value of @xmath260 makes it difficult for the non - monotonic @xmath28 to be observed as the initial values of @xmath243 are usually much less than @xmath261 . as a result , for @xmath185 near the critical region , the resistivity becomes insulating - like instead of going through the maximum .",
    "therefore , in ultra clean silicon mosfets , the behaviour of the resistivity not far from the transition is quantitatively well described by the renormalization group analysis that considers the interplay of the electron - electron interactions and disorder when the electron band has two distinct valleys .",
    "the theory in this case remains in control down to exponentially low temperatures , unlike the single valley case , where @xmath247 diverges at @xmath262 , or at temperatures just below @xmath140 .",
    "a parallel magnetic field provides a zeeman splitting and gives rise to positive magnetoresistance ( lee and ramakrishnan 1982 ; finkelstein 1984 ; castellani  1998 ) . in a very strong magnetic field ,",
    "when the electrons are completely spin - polarized , the system becomes `` spinless '' . in this case , the system always scales to an insulator , and in the weak disorder limit , a universal logarithmic temperature dependence is expected : @xmath263      far from the transition ( @xmath264 ) , the inverse scattering time @xmath265 is often smaller than the temperature at which the experiments are performed , and one is in the ballistic regime : @xmath266 .",
    "the interaction theory by zala  ( 2001 ) considers coherent electron scattering off the friedel oscillations .",
    "the phase of the friedel oscillation is such that the wave scattered from the impurity interferes constructively with the wave scattered from the oscillation , leading to a quantum correction to the drude conductivity , @xmath217 .",
    "as has already been mentioned , this correction ( @xmath267 ) , which is logarithmic in the diffusive regime , becomes linear in the ballistic regime : @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the fermi liquid interaction parameter in the triplet channel .",
    "as in the diffusing regime , the sign of @xmath270 depends on the constant @xmath269 .    the total correction to the conductivity",

    "the divergence at low temperature is due to the usual logarithmic correction ( altshuler , aronov and lee 1980 ; finkelstein 1983 , 1984 ; castellani  1984 ) .",
    "although the exact value of @xmath239 can not be calculated theoretically ( in particular , its relation to the conventional measure of the interaction strength , @xmath70 , is unknown for @xmath271 ) , it can in principle be found from a measurement of the pauli spin susceptibility .",
    "the correction to the conductivity is almost always monotonic , except for a narrow region @xmath272 .    as in the diffusive limit , magnetic field in the ballistic regime suppresses the correction in the triplet channel in eq .",

    "this was attributed to the neglect of additional scattering terms that affect the temperature dependence more strongly than the field dependence . despite this quantitative discrepancy",

    "the calculations of finkelstein ( 1983 , 1984 ) , castellani  ( 1984 ) and zala  ( 2001 ) use the fermi liquid as a starting point . as discussed earlier , @xmath70 becomes so large that the theory s applicability is in question near the transition ( chamon  2001 ; for a review , see varma  2002 ) .",
    "moreover , the behaviour of the effective mass reported by shashkin  ( 2003a , 2003b ) in the vicinity of the transition is unlikely to be consistent with a fermi liquid model .",
    "very little theory has been developed for strongly interacting systems for which @xmath70 is large but below the expected wigner crystallization .",
    "several candidates have been suggested for the ground state of the strongly interacting 2d system , among them ( i )  a wigner crystal characterized by spatial and spin ordering ( wigner 1934 ) , ( ii )  an itinerant ferromagnet with spontaneous spin ordering ( stoner 1946 ) , and ( iii )  a paramagnetic fermi liquid ( landau 1957 ) . according to numerical simulations ( tanatar and ceperley 1989 ) ,",
    "wigner crystallization is expected in a very dilute regime , when @xmath70 reaches approximately 35 .",
    "this value has already been exceeded in the best @xmath65-type gaas / algaas heterostructures ; however , no dramatic change in transport properties has occurred at the corresponding density .",
    "recent detailed numerical simulations ( attaccalite  2002 ) have predicted that in the range of the interaction parameter @xmath280 prior to the crystallization , the ground state of the system becomes an itinerant ferromagnet .",
    "the corresponding schematic phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] . as discussed earlier",
    ", there are experimental indications that a spontaneous spin polarization may occur at a finite electron density in silicon mosfets ( and possibly in gaas / algaas heterostructures ) .",
    "chakravarty  ( 1999 ) have proposed a more complicated phase diagram where the low - density insulating state is a wigner glass , a phase that has quasi - long - range translational order and competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin - exchange interactions .",
    "the transition between insulating and metallic states within this theory is the melting of the wigner glass , where the transition is second order due to the disorder .",
    "spivak ( 2002 ) predicted the existence of an intermediate phase between the fermi liquid and the wigner crystal with a first order transition in a clean electron system . the suggested phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ spivak ] .",
    "in analogy with he@xmath281 , where @xmath146 increases approaching the crystallization point , spivak ( 2001 ) suggested in an earlier paper that the renormalization of @xmath146 is dominant compared to that of the @xmath185-factor as the transition is approached , and that @xmath146 should increase with magnetic field .",
    "although the increase of the mass is in agreement with the experimental results of shashkin  ( 2002 , 2003a , 2003b ) , the suggested increase of @xmath146 with the degree of spin polarization is not confirmed by their data .",
    "the strong increase of the effective mass near crystallization also follows from the approach used by dolgopolov ( 2002 ) , who has applied gutzwiller s variational method ( brinkman and rice 1970 ) to silicon mosfets , and from the dynamical mean - field theory ( tanaskovi  2003 ) . however , the predicted dependence of @xmath146 on the degree of spin polarization is again at odds with the experiment .",
    "dharma - wardana ( 2003 ) has argued that in two - valley systems , correlation effects outweigh exchange , and a coupled - valley state is formed at @xmath282 leading to strong enhancement of the effective mass , which in this case is only weakly dependent on the degree of spin polarization .",
    "significant progress has been achieved during the past few years in understanding the metallic state found a decade ago in strongly interacting 2d systems .",
    "there is now considerable evidence that the strong metallic temperature dependence of the resistance in these systems is due to the delocalizing effects of strong electron - electron interactions . in ultra - clean silicon systems ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity is universal near the metal - insulator transition and is quantitatively well described by the renormalization group theory ; deep in the metallic state , in the ballistic regime , the temperature dependence of the resistance can be explained by coherent scattering of electrons by friedel oscillations . in both cases ,",
    "an external magnetic field quenches the delocalizing effect of interactions by aligning the spins , causing a giant positive magnetoresistance .",
    "the metal - insulator transition is not yet understood theoretically . in silicon mosfets ,",
    "various experimental methods provide evidence for a sharp increase and possible divergence of the spin susceptibility at some finite sample - independent electron density , @xmath9 , which is at or very near the critical density for the mit in high mobility samples .",
    "unlike the stoner instability which entails an increase in the @xmath185-factor , the increase in the susceptibility in these systems is due to an increase of the effective mass .",
    "the effective mass is , in turn , found to be independent of the degree of spin polarization , implying that the increase is not due to spin exchange , in disagreement with the fermi liquid model .",
    "a similar increase of the spin susceptibility is observed in gaas / algaas heterostructures , but it is not yet clear whether or not it points to a spontaneous spin polarization at a finite carrier density .",
    "the fact that the @xmath75 metal - insulator transition in the least disordered silicon samples occurs at or very close to @xmath9 indicates that the transition in such samples is a property of a clean electron system and is not driven by disorder .",
    "quantum localization appears to be suppressed near the transition in these systems . in lower mobility samples ,",
    "the localization transition occurs at electron densities much higher than @xmath9 and may be driven by disorder .    in closing",
