    "theory of topological defects is a natural framework for studying properties of physical systems . in cosmology",
    ", the origin of defects can be understood as a sequence of phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "these processes occur with critical temperatures which are related to the corresponding symmetry spontaneously breaking scales @xcite .",
    "these phase transitions can give rise to topologically stable defects , for example , domain walls , strings and monopoles @xcite .",
    "topological defects are also found in condensed matter systems . in these systems",
    ", they appears as vortices in superconductors , domain wall in magnetic materials , dislocations of crystalline substances , among others .",
    "an important property that can be verified in topological defects is that they are described by a spacetime metric with a riemann ",

    ", we look for a cosmic string , which is a linear topological defect with a conical singularity at the origin .",

    "we derive the dirac - pauli equation in the cosmic string spacetime without neglecting the term which depends explicitly on the spin .",

    ", we use the same vierbein of the ref .",
    "@xcite , where the spinorial affine connection @xmath26 has been calculated in detail .",
    "moreover , in this work , we are only interested on the planar dynamics of a spin1/2 neutral particle under the action of a radial electric field . in this manner",
    "we require that @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , according to the tetrad postulated @xcite , the matrices @xmath30 can be any set of constant dirac matrices in a such way that we are free to choose a representation for them .",
    "we choose to work in a representation in which the dirac matrices are given in terms of the pauli matrices , namely @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the pauli matrices and @xmath33 is twice the spin value , with @xmath34 for spin `` up '' and @xmath35 for spin `` down '' . in this representation ,",
    "the only non - vanishing component of the spinorial affine connection @xmath26 is found to be @xmath36 for the field configuration , we consider the electric field due to a linear charge distribution , superposed to the cosmic string . the expression for this field is seem to be @xmath37 therefore , the second order equation associated with eq .",

    "however , there , the spin effect was not taken into account once the author imposed the regularity of the wave function at the origin .",
    "the inclusion of spin gives rise to the dirac delta function potential , which comes from the interaction between the spin and the line of charge , and its inclusion has effects on the scattering phase shift , giving rise to an additional scattering phase shift @xcite .",
    "thus , the main aim of this work is to show that there are bound states due to the presence of the dirac delta function .",
    "the approach adopted here is that of the self  adjoint extensions @xcite , which has been used to deal with singular hamiltonians , for instance , in the study of spin 1/2 aharonov - bohm system and cosmic strings @xcite , in the aharonov - bohm - coulomb problem @xcite , and in the equivalence between the self ",

    "all the self ",
    "adjoint extension of @xmath54 , @xmath65 , are accomplished by requiring the boundary condition at the origin @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "this situation is equivalent to impose the dirichlet boundary condition on the wave function . on the other hand , if @xmath74 , @xmath65 describes a point interaction at the origin . in this latter case",
    "the boundary condition permits a @xmath75 singularity in the wave functions at the origin @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] we plot the planes @xmath90 for @xmath77 and @xmath34 .",

    "we can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) that , for @xmath91 , only for @xmath92 the operator @xmath78 is not self adjoint , whereas for @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ) the operator @xmath54 is not self adjoint for @xmath92 and @xmath94 , but not for both values of @xmath79 at same time for the whole range of @xmath95 values .",
    "indeed , a necessary condition for the operator @xmath54 not being self ",
    "adjoint for the state with @xmath94 is @xmath96 .",
    "in fact , this condition is also valid for @xmath97 and , in this latter case , the @xmath79 values for which the @xmath54 is not self  adjoint are shifted to the values @xmath98 and @xmath99 . for @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) ) we can observe that there is a range the values of @xmath95 in which , for both values of @xmath92 and @xmath94 , the operator @xmath78 is not self  adjoint . and last but not least , @xmath101 ( see fig [ fig : fig2 ] ( d ) ) is the only situation in which the operator @xmath78 is not self ",
    "adjoint for the both values of angular momentum quantum number for the whole range of @xmath95 ( the unique exception is @xmath102 ) .",
    "now , let us comeback to the solution of eq . . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is the bessel differential equation .",
    "thus , the general solution for @xmath103 is seen to be @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the bessel function of fractional order .",
    "the coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 represent the contributions of the regular and irregular solutions at the origin , respectively . thus making use of the boundary condition in eq . in the subspace @xmath63 , a relation between the coefficients",
    "is obtained , namely , @xmath108 where the term @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the gamma function .",

    "consequently , the total wave function reads @xmath115 it is well - known that the coefficient @xmath106 must be chosen in a such way that @xmath116 represents a plane wave that is incident from the right . in this manner",
    ", we obtain the result @xmath117 the scattering phase shift can be obtained from the asymptotic behavior of eq . .",
    "this leads to @xmath118 this is the scattering phase shift of the aharonov - casher effect in the cosmic string background .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , for @xmath83 , it reduces to the phase shift for the usual aharonov - casher effect in flat space @xmath119 @xcite .    on the other hand , for @xmath120 ,",
    "the contribution of the irregular solution modifies the scattering phase shift to @xmath121 thus one obtains @xmath122 which is the expression for the s - matrix in terms of the phase shift . as a result , one observes that in this latter case there is an additional scattering for any value of the self ",
    "adjoint extension parameter @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath72 , we have the s - matrix for the aharonov - casher effect on the cosmic string background , as it should be .",
    "the s - matrix or scattering matrix relates incoming and outgoing wave functions of a physical system undergoing a scattering process .",
    "bound states are identified as the poles of the s - matrix in the upper half in the complex @xmath123 plane . in this manner ,",
    "the poles are determined at the zeros of the denominator in eq . with the replacement @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",

    "however , we observe that @xmath132 has a dependence on @xmath109 , which in its turn has explicit dependence on @xmath123 ( see eq . ) .",
    "this behavior is associated with the failure of helicity conservation .",
