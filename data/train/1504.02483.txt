    "it is important to bear in mind that at the velocity dispersion of our target galaxies ( 200 - 400 km  s@xmath2 ) all indices are blends of multiple elements .",

    "we quote [ fe / h ] , which is directly inferred from the fe indices .",
    "if we assume that [ o / fe ] tracks [ mg / fe ] , then we can use the latter to infer [ z / h ] .",

    "there are a number of systematic effects that may impact the equivalent widths ( ew ) .",
    "one relates to the velocity dispersion : while the default dispersion corrections within _",

    "corrections agree with the input values within 0.02  for an @xmath8-enhanced model with a salpeter imf , which is a good approximation to our galaxies .",
    "the corrections are a weak function of stellar population parameters , but only at the hundredths of an   level , which is small compared to our other sources of systematic error .",
    "a larger correction must be made for low - level emission that can fill in the absorption lines and artificially lower their equivalent widths ( ews ) .",
    "weak emission from warm ionized gas is very common in the centers of elliptical galaxies @xcite , and small amounts of line infill can lead to significant errors in recovered parameters . even 0.1    errors in h@xmath45  ew can lead to errors of @xmath54 gyr in the modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the very low emission levels , and the large uncertainties involved , we compare two methods for determining the levels of [ ]  and h@xmath45  emission . in @xcite , we utilized ppxf+gandalf developed by m. sarzi @xcite and m. cappellari @xcite to simultaneously model the stellar absorption and emission lines .",

    "we then iterate these fits until the emission line flux has converged .",
    "in addition , we search for residuals around strong sky lines at 5200 and 5460  .    from our iterative fits , and focused on the galaxy centers for simplicity , roughly two - thirds of the galaxies have low - level h@xmath45  emission detected , with a median ew of 0.2 , and a maximum of 1  ( calculated for those galaxies with detected h@xmath45 ) .",
    "the gandalf measurements do not correlate very strongly with our iterative fits . in the gandalf",
    "fits , only half of the galaxies have detections , with a median ew is 0.2  and a maximum h@xmath45  ew of 1.7 . as a means of quantifying our systematic errors ,",
    "we rerun the stacking analysis described below on the gandalf - subtracted spectra . as expected , only the stellar age changes significantly , being @xmath55 gyr lower in the gandalf stacks .",
    "but all other stellar population properties are virtually identical ( with the [ fe / h ]  shifting higher by a small amount to compensate the shift in stellar age ) .",
    "thus , we present results based on the iterative fits , but we caution that there is a rather large systematic uncertainty in the absolute stellar age .",
    "all other stellar population properties are robust to this modeling difficulty , and in general the relative ages are robust as well .",
    "we are currently working on more robust gas detection schemes using all lines in the spectra ( v. pandya et al . in preparation ) .",

    ", we minimize small errors due to dispersion corrections to the lick indices",
    ". an alternate procedure would be to smooth all templates , in all bins , to a high dispersion ( e.g. , 400  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "we find very small ( @xmath69  ) differences in the resulting indices if we adopt the latter approach , again confirming that our dispersion corrections are working (  4.2 ) .",
    "when we make bins in @xmath3 below , because of the wide range of @xmath9  in each bin , we smooth all bins to 400  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we remove the continuum by dividing each spectrum by a heavily smoothed version of itself .",
    "this step simultaneously normalizes all spectra to the same level and ensures that differences in continuum shape ( whether real or due to small errors in sky subtraction or flux calibration ) do not impact the final line strengths .",
    "we then calculate the median flux at each pixel , with rejection , although we get very similar results using the biweight estimator @xcite .",
    "we experiment with multiplying the coadded spectrum by the median continuum before measuring indices , but the changes to the lick indices are negligible .      to determine the level of variation in the composite spectra , we generate 100 boot - strapped composite spectra by randomly drawing from the total list of galaxies in that bin , with replacement .",
    "we measure lick indices from each of these 100 trial spectra .",
    "we then assign errors on the lick indices that enclose 68% of the lick indices measured from the 100 trials .",

    "we believe that this larger error bar reflects a genuine increase in the spread in stellar populations in this bin . at yet lower @xmath3",

    "-0 mm      we now ask whether , at fixed @xmath9 , there are residual trends in the stellar population gradients as a function of stellar mass ( figure [ fig : radialmassig ] ) .",
    "we create two luminosity bins divided at @xmath94 mag ( which approximately divides the sample in two ) .",
    "we then enforce a matched distribution in @xmath9  between 200 - 330 km  s@xmath2  by creating 100 stacks for each mass bin , each having an identical distribution of @xmath9  and each including a total of 30 galaxies .",
    "we find small but detectable differences in the two mass bins .",
    "specifically , while the average stellar population ages are both @xmath95 gyr , we find that the high - mass bin is more @xmath8-enhanced by @xmath96 dex with ( possibly ) correspondingly lower [ fe / h ]  at fixed @xmath34 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the c and n abundances and radial profiles are consistent with each other , but there is a hint that the more massive galaxies are also more ca - enhanced at fixed @xmath9 .",
    "all of these trends could be qualitatively explained if the timescale for star formation were shorter in the more massive systems , such that [ fe / h ] is lower while [ @xmath8/fe ] is higher and [ ca / h ] follows [ fe / h ] .",
    "the other possible explanation is that at fixed @xmath9 , more massive galaxies are physically larger .",
    "this would explain why at a fixed fraction of @xmath34 , the more massive galaxies have lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "@xcite find that galaxies with the lowest central surface brightness also have the oldest ages and lowest [ fe / h ]  values , a similar trend to that seen here , albeit only for galaxy centers .",
    "when we have robust size measurements for our sample galaxies we will revisit the question of stellar populations through the fundamental plane , also including radial stellar population information .",
    "there are a number of interesting trends seen in the stellar populations of elliptical galaxy centers that challenge our understanding , particularly when compared with galactic trends .",
    "it is our hope that adding radial information will shed new light not only on the assembly history of ellipticals , but also on the nucleosynthetic yields that lead to these observed trends .",
    "there are a few important caveats to keep in mind as we interpret the observations .",
    "first , our stellar ages , particularly at the center , are subject to large ( @xmath97 gyr ) uncertainties .",
    "thus , we caution against over - interpreting the radial trends in age at present .",
    "some work covering larger dynamic range in radius do detect clear age gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we do not go to large enough radius to detect the very low metallicity true halo component that has been seen in a few nearby cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , we remain cautious about the nitrogen measurements given the possible flux calibration difficulties at the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "third , recall that we are examining average trends in stacked spectra .",
    "undoubtably there are interesting exceptions to all of these trends , and we plan to study the full range of parameters in future work .",
    "we revisit our expectations for stellar population trends as a function of radius in light of the recent picture that galaxies form in two `` phases '' , an initial burst of in - situ star formation creating the central component , followed by late - time accretion of smaller , fluffier units at larger radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for galaxies in our mass range ,",
    "the typical sizes of the central components are measured to be 2 - 5 kpc at @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when we look at the stellar populations at this typical radius ( figure [ fig : sigmasscor ] ) , we find that age and [ @xmath8/fe ] depend on @xmath9  rather than @xmath3 .",
    "since we expect galaxies that form early to be denser and have higher @xmath9 , a stronger correlation between age and star formation timescale with @xmath9  seems natural .",
    "in contrast , [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] , and [ n / fe ] depend more on the total stellar mass of the system .",
    "in addition to considering a fixed physical radius , we look at stellar population trends at @xmath98 ( figure [ fig : sigmasscor ] ) . according to simulations ,",
    "more massive galaxies are increasingly dominated by accreted stars at radii beyond @xmath99 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we might expect the correlation between @xmath9  and stellar population properties to decrease when taken over the bulk of the stellar population .",
    "this is what we observe .",
    "beyond @xmath100 we find no strong trend between @xmath9  or @xmath3 and abundances or abundance ratios .",
    "this result builds on what we saw in @xcite .",
    "there , we emphasized that the stellar populations beyond @xmath34 in massive galaxies tend to have low [ fe / h]@xmath101 dex and high [ @xmath8/fe]@xmath102 dex , stellar populations that are not seen in the centers of any galaxies today ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . here",
    "we see that beyond @xmath34 , galaxies over a relatively wide range in @xmath9  and @xmath3 have similar abundances and abundance ratios , as expected if the more massive galaxies were built by accreting the less massive . only stellar age",
    "is still seen to increase at higher @xmath9  when examined at @xmath100 ; we await better age measurements to verify this result .",
    "another ongoing discussion in the literature regards carbon . as is seen here , [ c / fe ]",
    "is observed to increase with @xmath9  in elliptical galaxy centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is in contrast to the behavior of carbon in the milky way or local group dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to get such super - solar carbon levels in the short timescales implied by the high ratio of [ @xmath8/fe ] , carbon must come not only from intermediate - mass ( agb ) stars but also from massive stars @xcite .",
    "carbon yields from massive stars are thought to increase with increasing metallicity due to increased mass - loss from winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these same high yields at high metallicity",
    "are also invoked to explain abundance trends in milky way stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if true , we would expect that as the metallicity decreases outwards in these elliptical galaxies , the [ c / fe ] would also decrease .",
    "this is what we observe @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that the [ c / fe ] gradient follows the decline in [ fe / h ] in both the @xmath9  and @xmath3 bins",
    ".    there is also considerable debate in the literature about the origin and behavior of nitrogen in elliptical galaxy centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our surprising results are two - fold .",
    "first , [ n / fe ] is remarkably super - solar . even assuming solar [ o / fe ] ( at odds with the observed [ mg / fe ] ) [ n / fe ] is found to be three times the solar value .",
    "second , since the n is produced by c through the cno cycle , their different behavior with radius is non - intuitive ( and may point to a changing o abundance as well ) . as discussed above , the flux calibration at the blue end of the spectrum , containing cn , is quite uncertain .",
    "we do find good agreement between cn as measured from the sdss spectra and the central mitchell fiber .",
    "we also confirm that the cn measurements do not depend on how we treat the continuum . including or excluding the overall continuum level in the stacks changes the cn1 measurement by @xmath103 mag , resulting in very small @xmath104 dex in the [ n / fe ] ratio . to really confirm these high n abundance ratios at large radius",
    ", we would like to perform full spectral modeling to mitigate the impacts of blending and the uncertainties introduced by oxygen . in the meantime ,",
    "it is interesting to note other stellar systems that display very super - solar nitrogen abundance ratios .",
    "for instance , in globular clusters , the wide range in [ n / fe ] strongly suggests pre - enrichment by a previous early epoch of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    finally , we come to ca .",
    "while nominally an @xmath8-element , it has long been known , based on both ca4227 in the blue and the calcium triplet ( cat ) index in the red , that ca is under - abundant with respect to the other @xmath8  elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there are a number of explanations in the literature for the cat measurements , including changes in the initial mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a minority metal - poor population @xcite .",
    "however , to explain both the blue and red index behavior , it is more natural to presume that ca behaves like an fe - peak element because it is predominantly produced in type 1a supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as expected in that case , we measure a flat [ ca / fe ] ratio with radius .",
    "the one intriguing difference is the possible increase in [ ca / fe ] at large radius , which is worth pursuing .",
    "-0 mm      -0 mm    while there are well - documented differences in the morphological mix of galaxies as a function of local galaxy density @xcite , the observations of environmental differences in stellar population properties are quite subtle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early studies found evidence for younger ages in ` field ' galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but do find a larger fraction of `` rejuvenated '' galaxies with recent star formation in low - density environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , the samples have grown large enough to evaluate not just the average properties of field and cluster galaxies , but to control for stellar and halo mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , pasquali et al .",
    "find that satellite galaxies at fixed mass grow older and more metal rich as their host halo mass increases .",
    "there is precious little literature on radial gradients in stellar populations as a function of group richness , although a few photometric studies find steeper metallicity gradients in lower - density environments @xcite .",
    "given our large sample and wide range of measured group richness @xcite , we are in a unique position to examine radial stellar population trends with environment .",
    "to divide the sample by richness , we use the group catalog of @xcite . when we divide our galaxies based on group richness alone",
    ", the distributions in @xmath9  do not match .",
    "instead , there are more high @xmath9  galaxies in richer groups .",
    "since @xmath9  is strongly correlated with stellar population properties , we must match the @xmath9  distributions across different halo mass bins .",
    "therefore , we divide the sample in half based on the number of neighbors : `` low '' comprises galaxies with no more than three companions of @xmath105 while `` high '' comprises the rest .",
    "the raw distribution of @xmath9  have median @xmath57@xmath9@xmath106  km  s@xmath2  for the low - density bin and @xmath57@xmath9@xmath107  km  s@xmath2  for the high - density bin .",
    "since there are not sufficient numbers to further subdivide the galaxies into bins of @xmath9 , we create 100 stacks , drawing from the objects with @xmath9  between 200 and 330  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we force the low - density and high - density stacks to have the same number of objects ( 24 in this case ) with the same distribution of @xmath9 .",
    "we do not have sufficient numbers to match on @xmath108 as well ; two - thirds of the rich galaxies are also in the brighter half of the sample .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : radialenvmatch ] .",
    "there are only very slight differences between the two galaxy samples divided by group richness .",
    "the high - density stack is slightly older , has slightly lower [ fe / h ] , and slightly higher [ @xmath8/fe ] , similar to some previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the basic interpretation is that objects found in the highest density peaks today likely formed earlier , and thus have older ages , higher [ @xmath8/fe ] , and slightly lower [ fe / h ]  ( although they maintain roughly solar metallicity overall ) .",
    "again , the other possibility is that at fixed @xmath9 , galaxies in denser environments tend to be slightly larger .",
    "we plan to control for galaxy size in future work . turning to the other light elements",
    ", we find that [ c / fe ] is marginally higher in the high - density bin , while [ n / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] are comparable between the two . finally , it is interesting to note that the sample variance is larger for the low - density sample .",
    "we see marginal evidence for a steeper [ fe / h ]  gradient in the higher halo - mass bin as a function of effective radius ( figure [ fig : radialenvmatch ] , right ; @xmath109 for the higher halo mass bin , @xmath110 for the lower halo mass bin ) .",
    "the slope difference is only significant at @xmath111 .",
    "[ @xmath8/fe ] also shows a very marginal difference in the opposite direction , with slopes of @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the higher and lower halo mass bins respectively . because of the anti - correlation between [ fe / h ]  and [ @xmath8/fe ] , the resulting gradients in [ z / h ] for the two bins are comparable ( @xmath114 in both cases ) .",
    "if this result is confirmed , it perhaps suggests that at a given @xmath9 , galaxies in richer environments are more compact , and thus show steeper [ fe / h ]  gradients .",
    "while we do see marginal differences between [ fe / h ]  and [ @xmath8/fe ] , we do not confirm results from previous photometric surveys that reported steeper metallicity gradients in lower density environments @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that in addition to looking for trends as a function of halo mass , we should also be dividing the samples into `` central '' ( the most massive galaxy in a halo ) and `` satellite '' galaxies .",
    "we therefore repeat the stacking exercise , but this time removing all satellite galaxies ( figure [ fig : radialbcg ] ) ; we do not have sufficient numbers of satellite galaxies to stack them alone .",
    "interestingly , when we examine central galaxies alone , the marginal stellar population differences discussed above vanish ( although we note that our statistical power is lessened by the smaller sample size as well ) . perhaps the differences between the two samples are driven by differing fractions of satellite galaxies in the two environmental stacks , but better statistics are needed before we can be sure .",
    "on the other hand , studies of individual brightest cluster galaxies in rich clusters find a wide spread in central properties such as age and [ @xmath8/fe ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , as well as evidence for distinct accretion episodes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in future work",
    "we will investigate in more detail the spread in central galaxy properties as a function of halo mass .",
    "we do not reproduce the trend found by la barbera et al .  that the central galaxies are younger in the larger halos . instead , when we focus on central galaxies only , we see no significant difference between the stellar populations of the two groups at the 0.1 dex level . on the other hand ,",
    "`` low - mass '' halos in the la barbera study have @xmath115  @xmath19 .",

    "furthermore , the differences reported by la barbera et al .",
    "are at the 0.025 dex level , not yet accessible with our data .",
    "using integral - field spectroscopy , we have looked at the average stellar population gradients for a large sample of 100 early type massive galaxies .",
    "we are able to reach radii @xmath6 or @xmath117 kpc . in keeping with previous results",
    ", we find no significant gradients in stellar population age nor [ @xmath8/fe ] abundance ratios with radius , and gentle gradients in [ fe / h ] .",
    "we thus confirm our previous result that the stellar populations in the outskirts of massive galaxies have sub - solar [ fe / h ]  but are enhanced in [ @xmath8/fe ] , suggesting that the stars formed quickly and early , but in shallow potentials @xcite .",

    "we see that age and [ @xmath8/fe ] rise with increasing @xmath9 , as we might expect if denser galaxies with higher @xmath9  form earlier .",
    "we also find that at fixed physical radius , [ fe / h ]  and [ c / fe ] correlate more strongly with @xmath3 than stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "in contrast , when looking at bins weighted towards @xmath100 , we find no strong trends between abundances or abundance ratios and @xmath9  or @xmath3 .",
    "the average star as measured near the half - light radius in the most massive ellipticals is similar to the average star as measured at the half - light radius in galaxies of lower mass , as we might expect if large galaxies grow via accreting smaller satellites .",
    "we do , however , still see a trend between stellar age and @xmath9  even in the @xmath34-weighted bins .",
    "the gradients in [ c / fe ] are similar to those seen in [ fe / h ] .",
    "we suggest that the c comes mainly from mass loss in massive stars because there is not time to get it from intermediate - mass agb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "higher yields due to mass loss from metal - rich stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) cause a pseudo - secondary dependence of carbon on fe .",
    "in contrast , we see super - solar [ n / fe ] that persists to large radius ; the mismatch between [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] is a puzzle",
    ". [ ca / fe ] has solar values over the entire radial range that we observe ( with the possible exception of a rise at large radius in the high dispersion bin ) , consistent with the idea that significant ca is produced in type 1a supernovae .",
    "thanks to our relatively large sample , we are able to examine trends in stellar mass at fixed @xmath9 . at fixed @xmath9 ,",
    "we find marginal evidence that galaxies with higher stellar mass are more @xmath8-enhanced and [ ca / fe ] enhanced ( because they are slightly [ fe / h ]  poor ) , suggesting a shorter timescale for star formation in more massive systems .    finally , we perform one of the most extensive spectroscopic studies of stellar population gradients as a function of group richness , while controlling for @xmath9 . overall , the differences in stellar population properties at large radius as a function of richness are very small , suggesting that internal properties like @xmath9   determine stellar population gradients ( as in galaxy centers ; e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "<S> we examine stellar population gradients in @xmath0 massive early type galaxies spanning @xmath1  km  s@xmath2  and @xmath3 of @xmath4 to @xmath5 mag , observed as part of the massive survey @xcite . using integral - field spectroscopy from the mitchell spectrograph on the 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory , </S>",
    "<S> we create stacked spectra as a function of radius for galaxies binned by their stellar velocity dispersion , stellar mass , and group richness . with excellent sampling at the highest stellar mass , </S>",
    "<S> we examine radial trends in stellar population properties extending to beyond twice the effective radius ( @xmath6 ) . specifically , we examine trends in age , metallicity , and abundance ratios of mg , c , n , and ca , and discuss the implications for star formation histories and elemental yields . at a fixed physical radius of @xmath7 kpc ( the likely size of the galaxy cores formed at high redshift ) stellar age and [ @xmath8/fe ] increase with increasing @xmath9  and </S>",
    "<S> depend only weakly on stellar mass , as we might expect if denser galaxies form their central cores earlier and faster . </S>",
    "<S> if we instead focus on @xmath10 , the trends in abundance and abundance ratio are washed out , as might be expected if the stars at large radius were accreted by smaller galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that when controlling for @xmath9 , there are only very subtle differences in stellar population properties or gradients as a function of group richness ; even at large radius internal properties matter more than environment in determining star formation history . </S>"
