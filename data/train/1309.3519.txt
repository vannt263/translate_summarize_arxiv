    "the science case for the alma beamformer reflects the broad scientific goals of the vlbi community .",
    "astronomers were solicited for input at a variety of meetings including the 10th european vlbi network ( evn ) symposium ( manchester 2010 ) , the xxx ursi general assembly ( istanbul 2011 ) , bringing black holes into focus : the event horizon telescope ( tucson 2012 ) , outflows , winds and jets : from young stars to supermassive black holes ( charlottesville 2012 ) , from stars to black holes : mm - vlbi with alma and other telescopes ( garching 2012 ) , and the 11th evn symposium ( bordeaux 2012 ) .",
    "this document includes input from scientists in all alma regions and is designed to be a living document , envisaged to evolve as new science areas are developed and existing areas refined by the community .",
    "the case for science with beamformed alma is broad , ranging from galactic to extragalactic science and touching on questions of vital importance for fundamental physics .",
    "* alma vlbi observations of nearby supermassive black holes in bands 6 and 7 will produce the first schwarzschild - radius - scale images of nuclear black hole accretion disks and jets . with this resolution",

    "high - resolution imaging of agn jets in conjunction with vlbi arrays in bands 3 and 1 will clarify the internal jet structure , the role of magnetic fields in jet launch and collimation , and connections with very - high - energy ( vhe ) photon emission ( section  [ agn ] ) .",

    "* astrometry will clarify the structure of the milky way and obtain geometric distances to galactic and extragalactic objects ( section  [ astrometry ] ) .    in order to address these scientific topics , phased alma",
    "will primarily be used as a crucial station in millimeter and submillimeter vlbi arrays",
    ". however , it will also be valuable as a stand - alone instrument ( e.g. , for high - frequency pulsar observations ) .",
    "the alma beamformer will most frequently be used in conjunction with other vlbi telescopes .",
    "alma s most significant contributions to vlbi arrays will be superlative sensitivity and higher angular resolution .",
    "the aggregated collecting area of 50 alma 12-m telescopes is equivalent to that of a single telescope with a diameter of @xmath0  m. this large aperture , combined with excellent typical atmospheric conditions and low receiver noise temperatures , means that phased alma will be the most sensitive element in vlbi arrays .",
    "the expected noise characteristics of alma in bands 3 , 6 , 7 , and 9 are summarized in table  [ tab - noise ] . in band 3 the system equivalent flux density ( sefd ) of alma",
    "will be a factor of two better than the green bank telescope ( gbt ) and nearly two orders of magnitude better than telescopes in the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "band 3 continuum observations between alma and the gbt can provide a single - polarization rms noise of less than 20  @xmath1jy in 1  hr in a bandwidth of 4  ghz .",
    "spectral line observations ( as , for instance , of 86  ghz sio masers ) will achieve an rms of nearly 2  mjy in a 1  kms@xmath2 velocity channel . at observing frequencies of 230 and 345  ghz ,",
    "phased alma will improve upon the sensitivity of the phased sma by more than a factor of 7 in rms noise on corresponding baselines .",

    "alma will more than double the north - south resolution of present 3 and 7  mm vlbi arrays ( figure  [ fig - uvcoverage ] ) . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the fringe spacings of the longest baselines to alma are smaller than 20  @xmath1as .",
    "importantly , alma will provide not only increased angular resolution but also @xmath3 coverage that is critical for imaging at 230  ghz and above .",
    "as the most extreme self - gravitating objects predicted by einstein s general theory of relativity ( gr ) , black holes lie squarely at the intersection of astronomy and physics .",
    "they are now believed to reside at the heart of the vast majority of galaxies , and power a subset of x - ray binaries .",
    "black holes play a critical role at the endpoints of stellar evolution , as the engines of gamma - ray bursts ( the brightest events in the universe ) , in the formation and evolution of galaxies via feedback , and in powering the high - energy phenomena associated with active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , launching relativistic jets and producing the extraordinary electromagnetic luminosities observed . )    resolving the immediate environment of a black hole on scales of the event horizon promises to provide sorely needed empirical insight into the impact of the black hole upon all of these processes .",
    "it is in this near - horizon environment where the accretion luminosity and relativistic outflows are produced , with potential implications on galactic and intergalactic scales .",
    "realization of this goal requires angular resolution that only ( sub)millimeter vlbi can provide ( falcke et al .",
    "2000 ) . the black hole with the largest apparent angular size , sgr  a * , subtends tens of _ _ micro__arcseconds .",
    "however , successful observations using the technique of 1.3  mm vlbi have made it clear that imaging the emission at the event horizon is now within reach .",
    "the most compelling evidence for this exciting possibility is the detection of structure on scales of @xmath4 ( schwarzschild radius ) in sgr  a * , the @xmath5  million @xmath6 black hole at the center of our galaxy ( doeleman et al .",
    "these results were obtained using a 3-station 1.3  mm vlbi array , and continued observations with an enhanced 1.3  mm vlbi network have now measured time variability on @xmath7 scales in sgr  a * ( fish et al .",
    "2011 ) and revealed structure at the very base of the relativistic jet in m87 ( doeleman et al .",
    "these results confirm the power of ( sub)millimeter vlbi to resolve regions at the black hole boundary where strong gravity is dominant , creating an opportunity of immense scientific potential .",
    "existing 1.3  mm and 0.8  mm telescopes have in recent years engaged in an effort to produce a network of telescopes to be used for millimeter and submillimeter vlbi .",
    "transforming this array into a wide - bandwidth , short - wavelength vlbi network that spans the globe , will achieve the resolution , sensitivity , and baseline coverage required to make true images of the event horizon .",
    "a critical step will be the inclusion of alma as a phased and beamformed single element in this observing array , the technical project described in this document .",
    "parallel efforts to wide - band vlbi instrumentation to match alma bandwidths are funded and underway at other potential network sites .",
    "this combination of phasing alma and increased bandwidth will advance three important areas that will dramatically enhance the current 1.3  mm vlbi array and enable future 0.8  mm vlbi .",
    "sensitivity : :    recording up to 8  ghz of bandwidth and coherently phasing alma will    lead to more than an order of magnitude sensitivity increase over    current 1.3  mm vlbi arrays .",
    "one of the greatest impacts of this    extraordinary leap in sensitivity will be the reliable measurement of    interferometric phase , leading to first imaging capability .",
    "polarization : :    focused efforts to enable dual - polarization recording at 1.3  mm and    0.8  mm vlbi telescopes will allow full - polarization vlbi data sets    ( all four stokes parameters ) .",
    "this capability will lead to new areas    of research that target magnetic field structure near the event    horizon .",
    "baseline coverage : :    addition of new 1.3  mm and 0.8  mm vlbi sites over the next three years    will increase imaging fidelity , sensitivity , and temporal coverage of    both sgr  a * and m87 .",
    "the scheduled addition of alma ( 2015 ) , and    inclusion of the south pole telescope ( now a fully - funded project ) and    the proposed greenland telescope will provide important new high    resolution baselines that enable imaging and sensitive tests for time    variable @xmath7-scale structures    ( figure  [ fig - globes ] ) .",
    "these new capabilities have the potential to fundamentally transform our understanding of black holes on event horizon scales .",
    "due to their mass and proximity , the two prime targets for such high - resolution studies are the black holes in the centers of the milky way ( sagittarius a * ) and virgo a ( m87 ) . at a distance hundreds of times smaller than that to the next nearest supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , sgr  a * can be studied in unparalleled detail and therefore plays an important role in astrophysics . on scales",
    "much larger than those probed by vlbi , the world s most powerful optical / ir telescopes have been trained on sgr  a * for years to directly observe the orbits of stars around the black hole and thereby measure its mass and distance ( ghez et al .",
    "2008 ; gillessen et al .",
    "2009a ) . from these and other observations ,",
    "the case for linking sgr  a * with a @xmath8 smbh is extremely strong ( reid 2009a and references therein ) . among the most compelling pieces of evidence",
    "is the new intrinsic size of sgr  a * measured using 1.3  mm vlbi , which implies a central mass density in excess of @xmath9pc@xmath10 , ruling out all but the most exotic black hole alternatives ( maoz 1998 ) . at a distance of 8",
    "kpc , the schwarzschild radius of this black hole subtends @xmath11as ( corresponding to an _ apparent horizon diameter _ of @xmath12as ) , making the apparent size of its event horizon the largest that we know of .",
    "vlbi at 1.3  mm wavelength can `` see through '' the interstellar medium that scatter broadens this source with a @xmath13 dependence . unlike sgr  a * , the giant elliptical galaxy m87 exhibits a relativistic jet from sub - parsec to kiloparsec scales and is possibly the best candidate for the study of jet formation and collimation on small scales with vlbi ( kovalev et al .",
    "2007 ; ly et al .  2007 ; hada et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) . at a distance of 16.7  mpc , the @xmath14 central black hole ( gebhardt et al . 2011 ) has @xmath15as , only slightly smaller than that of sgr  a*.      sgr  a * is highly underluminous , with a bolometric luminosity of around 10@xmath16 times the eddington limit .",
    "the emission from sgr  a * is conventionally modelled as arising from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) in which the electron and ion temperatures are decoupled from one another ( narayan et al",
    ".  1995 ) .",
    "the cool electrons are incapable of radiating much heat , while the hotter ions disappear through the event horizon or drive outflows ( yuan et al .",
    "contributions from a jet component are also possible ( falcke et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "some physical constraints on riaf models arise from fitting the multiwavelength properties of sgr  a * , including the spectral energy density and the implied accretion rate from faraday rotation and depolarization at millimeter wavelengths",
    ". however , spatially - resolved observations are necessary for unambiguously determining properties such as the spin of the black hole and the viewing geometry  indeed , for validating the riaf model in general .",
    "vlbi data at 1.3  mm ( doeleman et al .  2008 ;",
    "fish et al .  2011 ) , which provide this much - needed resolution , have successfully been used to constrain these parameters , establishing that the spin vector of the black hole has a large inclination to the line of sight and identifying a clearly preferred orientation in the plane of the sky ( broderick et al .",
    "2009 , 2011a ) .",
    "more sophisticated general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic models of the emission ( mocibrodzka et al .  2009 ; dexter et al .",
    "2010 ) and even jet models ( markoff et al .",
    "2007 ) reach consistent constraints , suggesting that the observed emission morphology is dominated by the geometry of the flow and the general relativistic beaming and lensing effects near the black hole rather than by turbulent microphysics in the accretion flow .",
    "while the present three - station vlbi array has been very successful in determining the structure of sgr  a * , some parameter degeneracies persist , largely because the marginal signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the vlbi data prevents use of vlbi phase information .",
    "the highly sensitive , very long baselines to phased alma will enable precise measurement of the closure phase , the sum of interferometric phase around a closed triangle of baselines .",
    "inclusion of closure phase decisively removes symmetry - flip degeneracies that persist when using only vlbi amplitudes ( broderick et al .",
    "simulations ( figure  [ fig - riaf ] ) show that measurement of closure phase on triangles including alma will produce exceptionally tight constraints on the spin vector of the sgr  a * black hole within the context of riaf models .",
    "one of the most promising areas where vlbi can make new contributions to the study of black hole physics is in searching for time - variable structures due to inhomogeneities in the accretion flow surrounding sgr  a*. localized heating in the inner accretion flow is a natural consequence of magnetic turbulence ( broderick & loeb 2006 ; dexter et al .",
    "2010 ) and can give rise to orbiting `` hot spots '' , which have been used to explain the pronounced x - ray , near infrared and submillimeter flares in sgr  a * ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2006 ; eckart et al .  2006 ; marrone et al .",
    "vlbi can not image these time - variable structures since they would be smeared out over a single observing epoch  for sgr  a * , the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) has a period of 30  min for a non - spinning black hole ( @xmath17 ) , and only 4  min for one that has maximum spin ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , clear signatures of hot spots should be detectable by using closure phase .",
    "( for the more massive black hole in m87 , the isco period is longer than an observing night , with the result that standard earth - rotation aperture - synthesis imaging can be used to make movies during periods when the emission is variable . )",
    "simulations of such hot - spots that include full gr ray - tracing and radiative transfer ( doeleman et al .  2009 ;",
    "fish et al .",
    "2009b ) show that baselines to alma can not only detect such hot spots using closure phase , but will have sufficient sensitivity to detect periodicity if the hot spots persist for multiple orbits in the accretion flow .",
    "detection of periodicity would result in a new way to measure black hole spin and test the validity of the kerr metric by studying ensembles of hot - spot orbits over many observing epochs .",
    "increased bandwidths combined with dual polarization receivers will also allow high sensitivity vlbi polarimetry of sgr  a*. at 230 and 345  ghz , the measured low angular resolution linear polarization fraction of sgr  a * is @xmath19% ( aitken et al .",
    "2000 ; bower et al .  2003 ; marrone et al .  2006 , 2007 ) , but models of magnetized accretion flows predict polarization fractions in excess of 30% and up to 60% on angular scales probed by 230 ghz vlbi ( bromley et al .  2001 ; broderick & loeb 2006 ) . it is probable that all previous polarimetry of sgr  a * has suffered from significant beam depolarization . only ( sub)millimeter vlbi polarimetry , particularly at the 345  ghz where source opacity is lowest and the blurring of interstellar scattering is least important , can observe the small - scale polarized structures that models predict , providing a very powerful new diagnostic of hot spots and accretion emission .",
    "on sensitive single vlbi baselines , weaker cross - polarized detections ( e.g. , between the right and left circular polarizations , rcp - lcp ) can be phase - referenced to the stronger parallel detections ( e.g. , rcp - rcp ) , allowing searches for time - variable polarized emission on @xmath7 scales .",
    "strong lensing due to general relativity around a black hole is predicted to produce detectable observational signatures .",
    "when a black hole is surrounded by an optically thin plasma , lensing should produce a bright photon ring with a dim `` shadow '' in its interior ( falcke et al .",
    "the shape of this shadow very closely approximates a circle for values of the spin @xmath20 ( takahashi 2004 ; johannsen & psaltis 2010b ) .",
    "confirmation of this prediction would probe more deeply and cleanly into a relativistic potential than has ever been done before .",
    "general relativity predicts not only the existence of the black hole shadow but also its size , which is proportional to the mass of the black hole .",
    "some uncertainties remain regarding the mass of the black hole in sgr  a * and its distance from the earth ( e.g. , ghez et al .",
    "2008 ; gillessen et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) , although the predicted diameter of the shadow is approximately 50  @xmath1as .",
    "a wide variety of models of the 1.3  mm emission , including models in which this emission arises in an accretion disk and others in which it originates from a jet , predict that the morphology of the emission will be dominated by general relativistic lensing , resulting in crescent - like images and a shadow that will be detectable on vlbi baselines to alma ( e.g. , dexter et al .",
    "similar results may be found for m87 , although there is less agreement on the predicted morphology of the emitting region ( e.g. , dexter et al .",
    "conversely , if general relativity is assumed to be true , measuring the size of a black hole shadow provides an independent measurement of the ratio of the black hole mass to the source distance ( johannsen et al .",
    "2012 ; ruprecht 2012 ) .",
    "the shape of the photon ring also provides a test of the `` no - hair '' theorem , which states that the exterior spacetime of a black hole can be completely characterized by the black hole s mass , spin , and electric charge .",
    "since it is difficult to envision how a black hole could sustain a gravitationally relevant net electric charge ( see blandford & znajek 1977 ) , the only independent multipole moments of the spacetime of a real astrophysical black hole are the monopole and dipole moments , which correspond to the black hole mass and spin , respectively .",
    "in general relativity , all higher moments are expressible in terms of the mass and spin alone .",
    "the simplest theoretical spacetimes that violate this theorem assume a quadrupole moment @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the black hole spin , @xmath23 is the mass , and @xmath24 parameterizes the deviation from general relativity ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ; johannsen & psaltis 2010a ) .",
    "when a nonzero quadrupole deviation is introduced , the shape of the photon ring and shadow becomes noncircular ( johannsen & psaltis 2010b ) , imprinting a signature onto vlbi quantities that would be detectable with an observing array that includes phased alma ( figure  [ fig - epsilon ] ) .",
    "similarly , many other alternative theories of gravitation make testable predictions for the properties of black hole shadows ( e.g. , the review by falcke & markoff 2013 ) .",
    "jets are believed to be powered through extraction of energy from accreting supermassive black holes .",
    "feedback from these jets enriches and heats the intergalactic medium and plays a role in galaxy formation .",
    "mechanisms have been proposed to explain how energy and angular momentum can be extracted from the accretion flow or the spin of the black hole ( e.g. , blandford & znajek 1977 ; blandford & payne 1982 ) , and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations are beginning to be able to model the magnetized plasmas in the inner accretion and outflow region ( e.g. , mckinney et al .",
    "2012 ) , but the lack of observations probing these small angular scales make it difficult to distinguish among classes of models that have the same behavior on large scales .",
    "+    recent observations have detected m87 on baselines between hawaii and the western us , establishing that at 1.3  mm the inner jet is approximately 38  @xmath1as ( 4.8  @xmath7 ) in size ( figure  [ fig - m87data ] and figure  [ fig - m87jetwidth ] ; doeleman et al .  2012 ) .",
    "this size favors models in which the jet is launched within a few schwarzschild radii of the black hole ( e.g. , nishikawa et al .",
    "2005 ) rather than arising from magnetic fields anchored out past the isco of the disk ( e.g. , de villiers & hawley 2003 ) .",
    "this size is also substantially smaller than the isco of a nonrotating black hole , which may suggest that the accretion flow rotates in a prograde sense around a spinning black hole .",
    "however , further observations on baselines oriented perpendicular to the roughly east - west direction of the doeleman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) detections , such as those between the us and alma , will be necessary to break degeneracies between this interpretation and other models .    at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the inclusion of phased alma in vlbi imaging arrays can address questions relating to jet launch and collimation mechanisms .",
    "the jet in m87 has been observed to have a parabolic jet width profile on scales ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( junor et al .",
    "1999 ; asada & nakamura 2012 ) .",
    "high - fidelity imaging at 3  mm is required to make the connection between the scales accessible to 1.3  mm vlbi ( a few schwarzschild radii ) and the @xmath27 scales observable at longer wavelengths .",
    "the structure of the m87 jet at 3  mm is observed to be highly variable , but global mm - vlbi array ( gmva ) observations suffer from limitations in image fidelity and sensitivity .",
    "higher - resolution jet images would allow a more precise measurement of the jet opening angle , which is predicted to be at least 60  if centrifugal acceleration along poloidal magnetic field lines connected to the accretion disk is responsible for jet formation ( blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "polarimetric observations of the emission near the jet base would help clarify the three - dimensional geometry of the magnetic field that launches the jet .",
    "multi - epoch observations at high fidelity will allow structures within the jet to be tracked , providing measurements of the velocity along the jet length .",
    "motions in the jet are known to be superluminal at the location of the knot hst-1 , approximately 100 pc ( @xmath28 ) from the black hole ( biretta et al .",
    "1999 ; cheung et al .",
    "2007 ) , but there is substantial observational disagreement as to whether the velocity at the jet base is highly subrelativistic , relativistic , or even superluminal ( kovalev et al .  2007 ;",
    "ly et al .  2007 ; acciari et al .",
    "the improved imaging capability provided by the inclusion of phased alma in vlbi observing arrays will clarify the acceleration profile of the jet in m87 .",
    "substantial scientific progress has been made to date understanding sgr  a * and m87 with non - imaging techniques , but much of this work has necessarily been dependent on models of the assumed emission morphology based on physical intuition and unresolved multiwavelength observations .",
    "direct imaging would provide a model - independent picture of the inner emitting region around supermassive black holes .",
    "the prospects for imaging sgr  a * or m87 in the next few years are great .",
    "bispectral maximum entropy imaging methods originally developed for optical interferometry ( e.g. , bsmem ; buscher 1994 ) have shown great promise in being able to produce image reconstructions from sparsely - sampled @xmath3 coverage ( e.g. , malbet et al .",
    "monte carlo imaging techniques , such as those used by the macim code ( ireland et al .",
    "2006 ) , also appear to be particularly well suited to millimeter vlbi ( ruprecht 2012 ) .",
    "compared to deconvolution - based methods , these forward - imaging algorithms are able to provide significantly better image quality and , in the case of sparse arrays , often succeed when clean fails to converge at all .",
    "an array consisting solely of phased alma and the three telescope sites in the us that have been participated in 1.3  mm vlbi observations ( carma , smt , hawaii ) can produce images that are sufficient to distinguish between models of the m87 jet that differ only on scales of a few @xmath7 . figure  [ fig - m87images ] shows two models , one of which has the jet forming close to the black hole with its emission strongly lensed into a `` shadow '' morphology . in the other model , the jet forms farther out from the black hole and the image is dominated by the approaching outflow , though a faint shadow is also observed .",
    "the addition of other antennas that are likely to be vlbi - capable at this wavelength before or shortly after the completion of the alma phasing project will enable much higher fidelity images to be produced .",
    "this is a possibility that can only be pursued with the sensitivity and baseline coverage provided by phased alma .",
    "powered by accretion onto black holes with masses up to @xmath29 m@xmath30 , agns represent the most energetic long - lived phenomenon in the universe . in @xmath19% of these objects , a substantial fraction ( as much as tens of percent ) of the energy of accretion is converted into kinetic energy of outflows in the form of relativistic , highly collimated jets of energetic plasma and magnetic fields .",
    "the jets emit highly variable nonthermal radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum that can greatly exceed the thermal emission from the accretion disk and host galaxy in blazars , agns in which one of the jets points in our direction . in some cases",
    ", the bulk of the observed flux emerges in @xmath31-ray photons in the gev or even tev energy range .",
    "one of the most intriguing and challenging quests of current astrophysics is to understand the physical conditions and processes that give rise to the formation of these relativistic jets , production of high - energy particles , and emission of @xmath31-rays .",
    "of particular interest is the question of how accretion onto smbhs generates such high - powered directed outflows .",
    "agn jets have profound effects on the surrounding environment , e.g. , in clusters of galaxies ( mcnamara et al .",
    "energy and momentum exchange between jets and the intracluster medium between galaxies can regulate the formation and growth of galaxies and the smbhs within them , as well as limit the rate of mergers and flows onto galaxies hosting smbhs ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ; di matteo et al .",
    "moreover , radiation from the jets ionizes gas along a cone surrounding the channel of flow within the host galaxy .",
    "shock waves form where jets ram into the external medium , inducing large bulk motion of gas and even triggering star formation .",
    "these effects are visible in agns today , but were even more prevalent at earlier epochs of the universe , when many galaxies were still in the formation phase and a greater proportion were strongly active . understanding galaxy formation and the birth of the early generations of stars is therefore intimately tied to our understanding of how black holes grow by accretion and generate relativistic jets , and how the jets propagate from the center of a galaxy to its outskirts and beyond .",
    "vlbi is the only technique currently capable of viewing directly the parsec- and subparsec - scale regions of jets in agns . at frequencies of 43 and 86",
    "ghz , the jet is mostly optically thin .",
    "the vlba currently provides angular resolution of @xmath32as in the east - west direction at wavelengths of 3 and 7  mm , but only @xmath33as in the north - south direction .",
    "the inclusion of phased alma as a vlbi station will more than double the north - south resolution of 3 and 7  mm vlbi arrays ( figure  [ fig - uvcoverage ] ) .",
    "such high - resolution observations can image the acceleration and collimation zone of the flow , which currently can be explored only in an indirect manner through time variability of flux and polarization .",
    "the jets of even the brightest blazars are challenging to detect with arrays composed of single - dish telescopes operating at 3  mm ; adding phased alma would improve this dramatically .",
    "the jets of radio - loud agns contain a bright , compact feature at the upstream end of 7 and 3  mm images .",
    "this is called the core , although in blazars and blazar - like radio galaxies there is considerable evidence that it lies more than 0.5  pc from the smbh that powers the agn ( e.g. , chatterjee et al .  2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the core is a key structure in a jet . at centimeter wavelengths what appears to be the core is generally just the transition between optically thick and thin emission , but at millimeter wavelengths it has the properties of a physical structure , such as a standing cone - shaped shock ( cawthorne 2006 ; darcangelo et al .  2007 ;",
    "marscher et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "synchrotron models show that in some sources the 7 and 3  mm emission is optically thin enough to trace the recollimation shock ( figure  [ fig : shock ] ) .",
    "a surprising result of recent studies that combine time sequences of 7  mm vlba images with monitoring of flux across the electromagnetic spectrum is that , in many blazars , most of the infrared , optical , x - ray , and @xmath31-ray emission originates in or near the core .",
    "it is frustrating that the core is only slightly resolved ( and not resolved at all in the north - south direction ) at 7  mm .",
    "currently , it is not generally resolved much better at 3  mm because the trans - continental baselines are too noisy . with the addition of alma , millimeter vlbi can resolve the cores in bright blazars as well as image a portion of the jet between the core and the central engine . by doing so",
    ", vlbi studies will address through direct imaging the key question of how ultra - relativistic jets are generated by accreting smbhs .",
    "in particular , such imaging can provide clues regarding how and where the outflow transforms from purely electromagnetic to kinetic energy - dominated , and the relative roles played by velocity shear , turbulence , shocks , and plasma instabilities in the flow .",
    "some of the most exciting recent discoveries in agn jets have arisen from studies of their structure transverse to the flow direction .",
    "observations of large scale agn jets with the vla ( laing & bridle 2002 ) show distinct velocity gradients in which a fast central spine is surrounded by a slower sheath that interacts with the external medium .",
    "it is not yet clear to what extent these interactions serve to stabilize and/or decelerate the flow , and how they influence the overall evolution and structure of the jet .",
    "our knowledge is more limited on small scales , due to the need for high dynamic range polarimetric imaging , preferably with a symmetric beam .",
    "the addition of phased alma to vlbi arrays will provide significant improvement in these directions , allowing observations of limb brightening and changes in polarization that provide powerful probes of the flow properties .",
    "the european space agency s gaia optical astrometry mission ( expected launch time late 2013 ) will provide astrometric and photometric observations of a large sample of qsos down to v@xmath34  mag .",

    "high - fidelity imaging with phased alma in bands 1 and 3 as part of vlbi arrays will produce better reconstructions of the jet emission , allowing observers to more accurately model the structure in both the forward jet and counterjet to determine whether the intrinsic structure is indeed asymmetric .",
    "models of bl lac objects with tev emission are self - inconsistent on the doppler factor of the jet , which henri & saug ( 2006 ) refer to as the `` bulk lorentz factor crisis of tev blazars . '' in brief , the two broad humps in the spectral energy distributions of these objects are usually attributed to synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and inverse compton processes associated with relativistic leptons . the fact that tev photons are detected  and therefore not destroyed by pair production processes  and the timescale of variability lead to the conclusion that the bulk lorentz factor must be very high ( e.g. , 10 to 50 ) in the ssc region .",
    "however , bl lac objects are a small subset of a larger class of fr i galaxies in which the jet is not aligned with the line of sight .",
    "the statistics imply that the bulk lorentz factor of the bl lac subset should be close to 3 , about an order of magnitude lower than believed from ssc / tev arguments .",
    "one possible resolution is if the jet is composed of two different regions , a mildly relativistic jet containing and confining a pair plasma .",
    "this model predicts that the jet emission at 3  mm , where opacity effects are less severe than at centimeter wavelengths , should be limb - brightened at a distance of @xmath43 from the black hole .",

    "osullivan & gabuzda 2009 ) and spatial structure of the magnetic fields and can therefore be used to test theories of jet structure .",
    "for instance , if the spine of the jet is pressure dominated but confinement is provided by toroidal magnetic fields , the gradient of faraday rotation across the jet should have a constant sign along the jet direction ( blandford 2008 ) .",
    "indeed , such rotation measure gradients have been detected in several jets ( e.g. , asada et al .",
    "2002 ; gabuzda et al .",
    "2004 ; gmez et al .  2008 ; hovatta et al .",
    "2012 ) and interpreted as indicating the presence of a toroidal or helical magnetic field in the jet sheath . however , the region in which the rotation measure gradient is detected is located at more than @xmath45 from the black hole , beyond the acceleration and collimation zone .",
    "high angular resolution observations with high sensitivity and image fidelity would allow similar results to be obtained nearer to the central black hole .",
    "the inclusion of phased alma will dramatically improve polarization capability at millimeter wavelengths . the quality and purity of the polarization signal in the alma receivers will allow dramatic increases in the fidelity of full - polarization vlbi images at high frequencies , which can be the limiting factor for polarimetric imaging at 86 ghz ; for example , the noise cutoff can exceed 50% of the polarization peak in current gmva observations ( mart - vidal et al .",
    "the large collecting area is also critical for improving the sensitivity of millimeter vlbi arrays , since the polarized flux is generally only a small fraction ( often 10% or less ) of the total intensity signal .",
    "the higher angular resolution available on long baselines to alma is important for reducing beam depolarization , which reduces sensitivity to structures that vary in polarization position angle on scales comparable to the beam size ( figure  [ fig-3c345 ] ) .",

    "references therein ) .",
    "progress on understanding which mechanisms apply to specific cases has been unsteady .",
    "for example , the periodic regular outbursts in oj  287 have been explained as arising due to interactions of a binary pair of smbhs ( sillanp et al .",
    "although this model has been developed and refined over the past two decades , no model is consistent with the totality of the observational evidence , including the timing of the outbursts , radio imaging , and optical polarimetry ( villforth et al .",
    "2010 ) . in some sources , there is no consensus even as to whether or not the jet precession is periodic ( e.g. , mutel & denn 2005 ) .",
    "regular monitoring with high angular resolution and high sensitivity is required to clarify the observational picture , a necessary prerequisite for interpretation .",
    "the mechanisms producing precession in binary agn systems with accretion disks may also have applicability to galactic microquasars ( e.g. , katz 1997 ) .",

    "the long baselines and sensitivity of phased alma are necessary to study the interactions within these close binary systems , such as the strength of the radio emission from close black hole pairs and the presence of a secondary jet .",
    "the presence of a second black hole causes periodic or quasi - periodic variability of the radio flux density and vlbi core flux ( e.g. , qian et al .",

    "astrometry of the innermost jet of these candidate binary systems willl test whether the black holes follow elliptical trajectories around a common mass center , providing the first direct evidence that these systems do indeed contain more than one supermassive black hole .",

    "they represent an opportunity to observe black hole dynamics and jet formation on a much smaller scale .",
    "alma will open up an important new way to study these because the field is currently limited by the need to go to higher frequencies for better resolution and sensitivity .",
    "microquasars are the stellar remnant of a star that has collapsed to form a compact object , such as a neutron star or black hole , and has remained gravitationally bound to its binary companion star .",
    "matter is transferred from the companion star to the compact object either via a stellar wind ( for high - mass stars ) or a roche lobe ( for low - mass stars ) .",
    "an accretion disk forms around the compact object , releasing extremely high energies within a very small volume .",
    "microquasars release a small fraction of the inflow matter by accelerating particles into highly collimated bipolar jets ; hence they have a similar morphology to quasars , but on much smaller scales .    like agns ,",
    "the jets from microquasars have a high luminosity , nonthermal spectra , and polarization properties consistent with self - absorbed synchrotron radiation ( hjellming & johnston 1988 ) .",
    "the minimum size of the jet region is related to the mass of the compact object and the turnover frequency at which the emission transitions from being self - absorbed to optically thin : @xmath46 . therefore ,",
    "emission from the compact jet can dominate the sed from stellar - mass sources at much higher frequency than in the cores of agn ( e.g. , ss433 ; figure  [ fig - ss433 ] ) . while we know that shocked ejecta from these sources can have superluminal apparent motion ( dhawan et al .",
    "2000 ) , the velocity of the compact jet is still unknown .",
    "we do not know exactly where superluminal shocks are formed or how their formation time is associated with changes in the accretion disk .",
    "one of the most persistently bright galactic microquasars is grs 1915 + 105 , which appears to be in near constant outburst .",
    "it is estimated that the source has a relatively high accretion rate ( @xmath47 ) , which feeds a jet moving at up to 0.98c ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ; fender et al .",
    "1999 ) , giving an overall spectrum that is flat and bright ( @xmath48  mjy ) from radio to submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "moreover , the source has one of the largest accretion disks in the galaxy . with an estimated outer radius of @xmath49  cm ( done et al .",
    "2004 ) , the disk size corresponds to an angular scale of @xmath50as , assuming a distance of 10 kpc .",
    "this matches very well the angular resolution of vlbi baselines to phased alma at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "vlbi with phased alma will be able to directly resolve the accretion disk and image the region where the particles are accelerated to superluminal apparent velocities .",
    "it will be possible to measure the expansion of the shocked jets , measure the tangential jet cross - section , and pinpoint the position of the central black hole or neutron star .",
    "alma will also be able to study the proposed free - free absorption region and observe anisotropy in the stellar wind around high - mass stars such as cygnus x-1 ( brocksopp et al .",
    "2002 ) . located at a distance of 1.86  kpc ( reid et al .  2011 ) , the black hole x - ray binary cyg  x-1 is observed to transition between low / hard and high / soft x - ray states .",
    "it is theorized that these states are characterized by the existence of a thick advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) inside a transition radius and a geometrically thin disk with hot corona outside this radius ( narayan 1996 ) .",
    "the low / hard and high / soft states may represent the two extremes of this picture , with the system transitioning from an adaf into a thin disk as the accretion rate increases ( esin et al .",
    "simultaneous radio and x - ray monitoring suggests that the disk , corona , and jet are all coupled , with the location of the jet base around @xmath51 above the black hole rather than near the inner edge of the accretion disk ( miller et al .",
    "cyg  x-1 is seen to produce a radio jet extending out to about 15  mas ( e.g. , stirling et al .",
    "2001 ) , but , unexpectedly , vlbi observations at centimeter wavelengths do not provide any evidence for the formation of knots or shocks as cyg x-1 transitions between the low / hard and high / soft states ( rushton et al .",
    "nevertheless , some differences must exist between the jet in these two states , since the total radio flux is modulated by the orbital period ( 5.6 days ; pooley et al .",
    "1999 ) in the low / hard state but not in the high / soft state ( rushton et al .  2012 ) ; furthermore , the millimeter flux density is substantially higher in the high / soft state than in the low / hard state ( tigelaar et al .",
    "it is possible that structural changes in the jet are being masked by the high optical depth near the radio core at centimeter wavelengths , although the very flat spectrum from radio through millimeter wavelengths suggests that a combination of self - absorbed synchrotron , free - free , and thermal emission combine to produce the emission from cyg  x-1 ( fender et al .",
    "high - resolution vlbi observations in bands 1 , 3 , and 6 including phased alma will have a much greater capability of detecting jet changes during the transition between the hard and soft states . due to their rapid timescale of variability , microquasars such as cyg x-1 represent unique probes of structural changes in small - scale disk - corona - jet systems , but the same physical processes may be applicable to agn / jet systems as well , in which variability due to changes in the accretion rate occur much more slowly .    finally , the inclusion of alma in vlbi arrays will enable high - precision astrometry (   [ astrometry ] ) of x - ray binaries .",
    "parallax measurements provide a direct geometric distance to the source , an important prerequisite for extracting the masses of the objects in these systems ( see , e.g. , orosz et al .",
    "detections of the orbital motion of the jet base place strong constraints on physical properties of the binary system , including estimates of the semimajor axis of the orbit and the ratios of the masses in the system .",
    "cyg  x-1 serves as a good example of the power of these techniques ( reid et al .",
    "2011 ; orosz et al .",
    "2011 ) , but the size of the orbital motion in angular units ( @xmath52  @xmath1as ) is larger than most other x - ray binaries .",

    "pulsars are broadband , steep - spectrum radio sources .",

    "a sensitive millimeter telescope is needed to increase this number .",
    "the location of alma is especially appropriate , since 72% of all known pulsars are located in the southern hemisphere .",
    "previous observations indicate that the emission properties at these very high frequencies are particularly interesting for understanding the creation of coherent pulsar emission .",
    "two out of the nine sources detected above 30 ghz show a peculiar change in the flux density , indicating a flattening or even an increase in the flux density with increasing frequency ( kramer et al .",

    "one natural interpretation for a spectral change in the range between centimeter and infrared observations is that the coherence conditions for normal pulsar radio emission break down and an incoherent component of the emission takes over ( kramer 1995 ; michel 1982 , 1991 ) . indeed , many of the poorly - understood ( though well - studied ) striking properties of the radio emission are likely a consequence of the coherence process , including nanosecond - scale pulse structure , very high brightness temperatures exceeding @xmath53  k , linear polarization fractions approaching 100% ( often with a strong circularly - polarized component ) , and steep radio spectra with spectral indices ranging between @xmath54 and @xmath55 . as plasma moves along curved magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere",

    "magnetars are a special class of neutron stars that typically have rotation periods between 5 and 12  s. they get their name from their very large inferred magnetic fields ( in excess of @xmath60  g ) , which appear to power these sources during their high - energy outbursts .",

    "they found significant differences compared to the same isotopic ratios in the local universe , and interpreted them as due to a gradual nucleosynthesis enrichment by low - mass stars , while massive stars contribute on a much smaller timescale . with high - angular resolution and high sensitivity , offered by the vlbi network including alma , it would be possible to investigate the interstellar mixing of elements at the sub - parsec scale in distant galaxies , and to much smaller scales by studying molecular absorption in milky way clouds .",
    "finally , recent alma early science data on pks 1830@xmath68211 focusing on absorption lines in the intervening galaxy have revealed remarkable time- and frequency - dependent variations in the flux ratios between the two lensed images of the background blazar ( mart - vidal et al .",
    "those variations were interpreted as chromatic structure changes related to the activity close to the base of the blazar jet , as the alma observations were serendipitously coincident with a strong gamma - ray flare in the blazar .",
    "hence , the observations of molecular absorbers have multiple interests , from the study of absorbing gas in the foreground galaxy , using molecules as cosmological probes , to the study of the background ( most likely strongly lensed ) quasar , vitally requiring the high angular resolution and high sensitivity that alma will bring to vlbi .",
    "thanks to large amplification factors , many masers are very spatially compact . multi - epoch vlbi studies of masers have been very scientifically productive , allowing astronomers to understand the environments and detailed dynamics of star - forming regions ( sfrs ) and the envelopes of evolved stars as well as obtain robust geometric distance measurements of other galaxies and of sfrs in the spiral arms of the milky way .",
    "the main emphasis has traditionally been placed on observations at centimeter wavelengths ( oh and 1.35  cm h@xmath79o ) , but there has been growing interest in millimeter and submillimeter maser studies as sensitive high - frequency telescopes and arrays have come on line ( e.g. , humphreys 2007 ) .",

    "the preceding sections summarize areas in which the alma beamformer will be uniquely capable to have great scientific impact . these span a wide range : from astrophysics to fundamental physics , from galactic sources to objects at cosmic redshift , from very compact objects to kiloparsec - scale jets , and from cool molecules to extremely hot plasmas .",
    "most of these studies will be made possible thanks to the sensitivity and angular resolution that phased alma will bring to vlbi arrays .",
    "pulsar observations with the alma beamformer can be done commensally with standard alma observing too , increasing the scientific efficiency of allocated alma time .    in this document",
    "we have attempted to identify the most fruitful lines of investigation that will be enabled by the alma beamformer .",
    "however , the history of astronomy demonstrates that when an instrument opens up a new area of discovery space , some of the most important scientific results come from unanticipated directions .",
    "the full measure of the scientific capability of the phased alma system will ultimately be limited only by the imagination of the astronomy community ."
