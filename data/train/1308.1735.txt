    "valence fluctuation phenomena in heavy - fermion ( hf ) compounds have attracted much attention because the quantum critical point ( qcp ) of the valence transition can play an important role the novel phenomena such as the superconductivity and the non - fermi liquid behaviors @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 is theoretically proposed to be located very close to the qcp of the valence transition @xcite .",
    "actually , considerable valence fluctuation was observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the valence state directly reflects the degree of localization of the @xmath5-electrons in hf systems , the temperature and the magnetic field dependences of the valence are intriguing research subjects .",
    "there are several techniques to measure the valence state , e.g. , photoemission spectroscopy , x - ray absorption spectroscopy , x - ray emission spectroscopy , and mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "@xmath6-edge x - ray absorption spectroscopy on the rare - earth ions is very suitable for experiments at high pressures @xcite and/or high magnetic fields @xcite , because high - energy x - rays have strong penetrating power , so an ultrahigh - vacuum condition is not necessary .",
    "determination of the valence state can be done in very high magnetic fields of up to 40  t by x - ray absorption measurement @xcite .    in the present study , we have studied the temperature dependence of yb valence in @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 @xcite by using @xmath6-edge x - ray absorption and emission spectroscopy .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectra were measured in high magnetic fields up to 32  t and a small , but finite valence increase was found at 40  k.",
    "the experiment was done at the beamline bl39xu of spring-8 , japan .",
    "pulsed high magnetic fields were generated by using a miniature magnet @xcite . @xmath0- and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 crystals were powdered and mixed with epoxy resin so that the effective thickness was appropriate for obtaining an x - ray absorption intensity of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the absorption coefficient and the thickness of the sample , respectively .",
    "a single crystal of @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 was also used for x - ray absorption and x - ray emission spectroscopy .",
    "the details of the experimental techniques using a pulsed high field are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the x - ray absorption spectrum at the @xmath6-edge ( from the @xmath10 to @xmath11 transition ) in a powdered @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 at 10  k. the spectrum of a single crystal of @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 was also measured and found to be very similar to that of the powdered sample . the solid curve is the result of the curve - fitting analysis .",
    "we analyzed the x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) by using a fitting function that consists of a lorentzian and an arctangent function .",
    "this is a standard method for analyzing the absorption edge and has previously been used in an x - ray absorption study of ybincu@xmath1 @xcite . the dashed and dot - dashed curves are the results of the curve - fitting for yb@xmath12 and yb@xmath13 states , respectively .",
    "background is represented by a dotted line .",
    "the main absorption peak around 8.950  kev due to the yb@xmath12 state is distinct . on the other hand ,",
    "the absorption band around 8.945  kev due to the yb@xmath13 state is not clearly seen in the spectrum .",
    "since the valence ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 was reported to be 2.75 at 20  k @xcite , about a 25% spectrum weight is expected to be observed .",
    "the lifetime broadening effect of the @xmath10 core hole can be the reason the yb@xmath13 band at the low energy is not very clear .",
    "however , as we show later , the yb@xmath13 band is confirmed to be located around 8.945  kev by the magnetic field dependence of xas .",
    "although the @xmath14 is deduced to be 2.84 from the fitting results shown in fig .  1 , the error bar can be as large as 0.05 because of the broadness of the xas .",
    "the solid curve is the result of the curve - fitting analysis . the dashed and dot - dashed curves are the results of the curve - fitting for the yb@xmath12 and yb@xmath13 states , respectively .",
    "background is represented by a dotted line .",
    ", width=377 ]    therefore , we determined @xmath14 at low temperatures by another method , i.e. , x - ray emission spectroscopy that enables us to observe the xas with smaller broadening effect of the core hole @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission spectra ( xes ) with different excitation energies at 2 and 280  k are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the emission band due to yb@xmath13 state is larger at 2  k compared to that at 280  k , indicating that the valence decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "x - ray emission spectra at different excitation energies in a @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 single crystal at 2 and 280  k.,width=321 ]    from the analysis of the xes @xmath14 was found to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 at 2 and 280  k , respectively .",
    "@xcite since the optical transition process of xes is more complicated than that of xas , the valence state can not be directly obtained by using the spectral weight .",
    "the detailed analysis is explained in elsewhere @xcite and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is found that the xes show distinct emission bands due to the yb@xmath13 and yb@xmath12 contributions .",
    "this is because the lifetime of the @xmath17 core hole that exists in the final state of the emission process ( from the 3@xmath18 to 2@xmath19 @xmath20 transition ) is expected to be much longer than that of the @xmath10 core hole .",
    "this high - resolution spectroscopy is more reliable than xas when the xas is broad , making it difficult to distinguish each valence state separately .",
    "hence , we take @xmath15 for the valence value of @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 at 2  k , and the temperature dependence of @xmath14 obtained from xas is used as the relative change . the relative change in the spectrum",
    "is determined precisely , and the valence change is determined with much smaller error bar compared to the error bar for determination of the absolute value .",
    "the temperature variation of @xmath14 is shown in fig .",
    "-ybalb@xmath1 and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 .",
    "the closed squares are the results of the single crystal of @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 , and closed and open circles are the results from the powdered @xmath0- ybalb@xmath1 and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 samples , respectively .",
    "open diamonds denote the results of xes in the single crystal of @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 .",
    "the dashed curves are guides for the eyes .",
    "( b ) temperature dependences of the yb valence in the single crystal @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 ( open squares ) and powdered @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 ( open circles ) are shown together with that of the yb valence in ybagcu@xmath1 ( open triangles ) @xcite .",
    ", width=491 ]    @xmath14 of @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 is also plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "because we did not measure xes of @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 , we used the literature value at 20  k ( 2.73 ) @xcite for the @xmath14 value at 5  k , and the relative change in @xmath14 with increasing temperature was deduced by the change in the xas in this work .",
    "it is found that the valence gradually increases with increasing temperature , and the increasing trends for @xmath0- and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 look similar .",
    "the occupation number of the hole in the 4@xmath5-shell ( @xmath21 ) is deduced from @xmath22 . according to the gtzwiller approximation , the deviation of @xmath21 from unity ( @xmath23 )",
    "can be expressed by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to the kinetic energy of the @xmath5 electrons with the electron interaction and that without the interaction , respectively @xcite .",
    "an itinerant character manifests itself in the deviation of the occupation number of the @xmath5 hole from unity @xmath23 .",
    "if we define @xmath27 as the difference of @xmath21 from that at the lowest temperature , the value @xmath27/(@xmath28 ) corresponds to the relative change in the degree of itinerancy when the temperature is increased .    in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the temperature dependences of @xmath27/(@xmath28 ) in single crystal @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 ( open squares ) and powdered @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 ( open circles ) are shown .",
    "@xmath27/(@xmath28 ) in another heavy fermion compound ybagcu@xmath1 @xcite is also plotted ( open triangles ) .",
    "ybagcu@xmath1 is one of the materials that are expected to be located in the vicinity of the qcp of the valence transition @xcite .",
    "the scale of the horizontal axis is set differently for ybalb@xmath1 ( bottom ) and ybagcu@xmath1 ( top ) so that the temperature variation of @xmath27/(@xmath28 ) in both materials almost overlap .",
    "the valence transition temperature ( @xmath29 ) was determined to be 42.3  k in ybagcu@xmath1 in our previous work @xcite .",
    "if we simply assume that the temperature dependence of the valence in ybalb@xmath1 is scaled to that in ybagcu@xmath1 , the hypothetical valence transition temperature ( @xmath30 ) is 288  k for ybalb@xmath1 .",
    "this value seems to be consistent with the fact that @xmath0-and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 have a large characteristic temperature @xmath31 @xmath4 250  k below which the magnetic moments are screened to form the hf state @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 becomes about 2.96 and the local magnetic moments are restored in ybagcu@xmath1 at about 70  k @xcite . according to fig .",
    "3(b ) , the localized magnetic moments are expected to be restored in @xmath32 and @xmath33ybalb@xmath1 at corresponding temperature around 480  k.    since the characteristic temperature @xmath31 of ybalb@xmath1 is as high as 250  k @xcite , a strong magnetic field is necessary to see the effect of the magnetic field on the valence state .",
    "figure 4 shows xas at 0 and 32  t in the lower panel and the difference spectrum between 0 and 32  t ( dxas ) in the upper panel .",
    "the measurement temperature was 40  k. the xas seem to be almost identical at 0 and 32  t. however , the positive peak around 8.950  kev and negative peak around 8.945  kev in dxas are clear evidence of an increase in the yb@xmath12 component and a decrease in the yb@xmath13 component , respectively .",
    "the solid curve is the result of the curve fitting .",
    "the agreement of the fitting and the experimental data confirms that a small valence increase , @xmath34 , is induced by a magnetic field of 32 t. although a similar measurement was made at 5  k for the same sample no clear valence change was observed .",
    "therefore , the observed field - induced small valence change was assisted by a thermal excitation at 40  k.    -ybalb@xmath1 sample at 0 and 32 t ( lower panel ) .",
    "the difference spectrum between the xas at 0 and 32 t is shown in the upper panel , together with the result of the curve fitting .",
    "a magnetic field is applied parallel to the c - axes of the powders that were aligned by means of a steady magnetic field of 14  t when the epoxy resin was solidified .",
    "the measurement temperature was 40 k. , width=377 ]",
    "xas and xes in @xmath0- and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1 were investigated at several temperatures and a high magnetic field of 32  t. the observed yb valence is 2.78 @xmath3 0.01 in @xmath0-ybalb@xmath1 at 2 k by using xes .",
    "the yb valences of these materials are found to increase with increasing temperature and by applying a magnetic field . by comparison with another heavy fermion compound ybagcu@xmath1 , the hypothetical valence transition temperature in @xmath0- and @xmath2-ybalb@xmath1",
