    "cosmic strings have been extensively studied in the context of classical field theory , and nielen - olesen vortex - strings in the abelian - higgs model have been regarded as the representative example  @xcite . by solving the nonlinear field equations in the abelian - higgs model , one obtains point - like vortex solutions in 2-dimensional flat space .",
    "when such solitons gravitate in three dimensional spacetime , their 1-dimensional stringy objects could be interpreted as straight cosmic strings .",
    "the resulting conical geometry with deficit angle  @xcite has cosmological implications associated with possible lensing signatures , which are significantly different from those of standard gravitational lenses  @xcite , or cosmological perturbations induced by the motion of cosmic strings .    a characteristic property of some topological solitons , including kinks , vortices , and monopoles , is saturation of the bps bound  @xcite . in the case of the bps vortices in the abelian - higgs model ,",
    "an analysis of moduli space dynamics based on their @xmath5 zero modes predicts 90 degree scattering in the head - on collision of two slowly - moving vortices  @xcite .",
    "this property has been confirmed by numerical analysis even for the fast - moving vortices  @xcite , and it suggests an inter - commuting process of two colliding strings , which plays an important role in the evolution of a stringy network .",
    "another candidate for cosmic string is the superstring  @xcite .",
    "it shares almost all of the characteristic with vortex - strings in gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism . as the topics of d - branes and the warped geometry have been developed , the idea of the cosmic superstring has recently been revived and , as an appropriate candidate , the d- and df - strings have attracted much attention  @xcite . concerning string cosmology  @xcite ,",
    "an intriguing setting is d- and df - strings generated from the system of d3@xmath6 , particularly those in the  model  @xcite .    for the generation of macroscopic d- and df - strings from the system of d3@xmath0",
    ", a useful description can be made by employing the tachyon effective action  @xcite as shown in the case of tachyon kinks  @xcite .",
    "when d3 and @xmath0 are separated by a short distance , they start to approach each other due to mutual attraction and finally collide .",
    "cosmologically , this period corresponds to an inflationary era in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "instability of d@xmath7 implies the presence of a complex tachyon field , and zero modes on d and @xmath8 correspond to two gauge fields of the u(1)@xmath9u(1 ) symmetry . for description of this system ,",
    "two kinds of effective actions have been proposed : one is that derived from boundary string field theory , which is very complicated  @xcite , and the other is that of a dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) type  @xcite . as a u(1 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken , codimension - two d- or df - branes are given as static vortex - string solutions in flat spacetime .",
    "these are nothing but straight d- or df - strings ( ( @xmath10)-strings ) from the d3@xmath11  @xcite . in order to detect fossils of the cosmic superstrings",
    ", some remnants of macroscopic cosmic superstrings should survive in the present universe as far as their result is consistent with the data from the cosmic microwave background experiments . in this sense , d(f)-strings from d3@xmath6",
    "is deemed more viable since they are produced after d - brane inflation  @xcite .",
    "once cosmic superstrings are produced , various dynamical issues need to be understood , e.g. , collisions between d - strings , f - strings , and df - strings  @xcite , formations of y - junctions  @xcite , probability of the reconnection of cosmic superstrings  @xcite , and evolution of a cosmic df - string network  @xcite .",
    "when the d@xmath8 is dissociated , it decays into either perturbative closed string degrees  @xcite or nonperturbative open string degrees like cosmic d(f)-strings . in this sense ,",
    "graviton production from d- or df - strings is intriguing  @xcite . concerning string cosmology based on flux compactification  @xcite , d- and df - strings in a warped geometry need also to be studied  @xcite .    in section 2 , we introduce the dbi type action of d3@xmath11 and investigate gravitating thick global d - strings with radial electric flux .",
    "on the spatial manifold @xmath12 , the straight strings , stretched along the @xmath13 , are attached to both the south and north poles of the @xmath14 .",
    "a horizon is formed along the equator of the @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the solution found is a black string solution  @xcite . in section 3 , through a systematic study , we demonstrate the saturation of the bps sum rule in the thin - limit d- and df - strings in both flat and curved spacetime .",
    "we derive a condition for the tachyon potential saturating the bps sum rule of multi - d(f)-strings and show that gaussian type tachyon potential saturates this bps sum rule , consistent with the descent relation for codimension - two bps branes . the resulting deficit angle for thin bps d- and df - strings has the maximum value of @xmath3 .",

    "moreover , @xmath185 vanishes everywhere in the limit of @xmath186 .",
    "thus the first - order bogomolnyi equation ( [ be1 ] ) is consistent with the second - order tachyon equation ( [ ter ] ) for static bps d- and df - strings , equivalent to conservation of energy - momentum , @xmath187 , for nontrivial solutions .",
    "therefore , the tachyon configurations given by the solutions ( [ ph])([ta1 ] ) of the bogomolnyi equation ( [ be1 ] ) can be a bps configuration only in the limit of infinite @xmath188 .    to see the bps relation , let us look into the hamiltonian density : @xmath189 where the corresponding conjugate momenta are @xmath190 for the static tachyon configurations , @xmath191 from ( [ cm1])([cm2 ] ) .",

    "therefore , the constraint to the shape of the tachyon potential @xmath210 is @xmath211 suppose that we consider first the 1/cosh type tachyon potential ( [ v3 ] ) as a candidate .",
    "if we perform the integration for a single d(f)-string with @xmath212 before taking @xmath186 , the integration produces @xmath213 which is different from the descent relation ( [ dsr ] ) .",

    ". then , the above argument can be applied in the same manner since the gaussian type potential reproduces correctly the bps sum rule ( [ dsr ] ) for an arbitrary number of superimposed d(f)-strings as mentioned previously . in synthesis",
    ", the aforementioned analysis means that the gaussian type tachyon potential ( [ bsft ] ) passes all of the requirements for the bps sum rule ( [ sxc])([dsr ] ) so that ( [ bsft ] ) is a bps potential for parallel d(f)-strings .    for these d- and df - strings , the boost symmetry along the string direction is sustained : @xmath238 though the above bps limit was attained in the scheme of field theory , the bps limit for thin d(f)-strings is consistent with the nature of a bps d1-brane with zero thickness in string theory .    from now on , let us move to a discussion of the bps bound in curved spacetime",
    ". with the metric ( [ trme ] ) for curved spacetime , the pressure difference , @xmath239 , becomes @xmath240 which leads to the same bps equation in flat spacetime ( [ be1 ] ) with cylindrical symmetry and the linear ( @xmath241 ) singular ( @xmath242 ) tachyon profile ( [ ph])([ta1 ] ) .",
    "we check that the first - order equation and its would - be bps configuration satisfies the second - order euler - lagrange equations .",

    "substitution of ( [ ta1 ] ) with @xmath241 and @xmath253 results in @xmath254 where the function @xmath255 is defined as @xmath256 . for @xmath250 , the right - hand sides of ( [ eeq2])([eeq1 ] ) vanish due to the runaway property of the tachyon potential .",
    "hence , the solutions for @xmath250 are @xmath257 and @xmath258 , where @xmath68 , @xmath259 , @xmath69 , and @xmath227 are integral constants .",
    "the nontrivial solution consistent with the required boundary condition in ( [ bdy ] ) is @xmath260 .",
    "then ( [ eeq2 ] ) requires a boundary condition @xmath261 since @xmath262 is unity while @xmath263 is zero in the entire region .",
    "hence , @xmath227 in @xmath264 should be greater than @xmath265 .    in ( [ eeq1 ] ) , a constraint form of the tachyon potential for the desired descent relation",
    "is assumed as discussed in ( [ bpe ] ) , @xmath266 , where @xmath267 in this case .",
    "the left - hand side of ( [ eeq1 ] ) is @xmath268 .",
    "comparison with the right - hand side of ( [ eeq1 ] ) yields @xmath269 , which provides a familiar conic spatial structure of the deficit angle , @xmath270 . since @xmath271",
    ", the deficit angle has , amazingly , the maximum value , @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , for the d- and df - strings , the same bps limit is saturated in curved spacetime , where the left - hand side of ( [ eeq1 ] ) leads to a topological quantity from the geometry side , an euler number , and the right - hand side to a topological charge of a soliton , vorticity .    in curved spacetime , comparing with the d - strings , the only difference for the df - string is a constant , @xmath272 .",
    "since bps bound is attained for the constant lapse function @xmath273 , the previous bps bound of the d - strings in curved spacetime is automatically applied to the case of df - strings .    when the electric flux @xmath101 along the radial direction is turned on , any bps bound is not saturated for these thick d - strings with electric flux .",
    "in addition , @xmath274 and thus the boost symmetry along the string direction breaks down to a translation symmetry along the @xmath23-axis .    for the abelian higgs model ,",
    "the gauge field is indispensable .",
    "it converts the global vortices of the logarithmically divergent energy into the local vortices of finite energy .",
    "in addition , these local vortices can saturate the bps bound under a specific form of scalar potential  @xcite . in the case of d- and df - strings , their energy can not be tamed by the gauge field @xmath19 and the bps limit is achieved in the limit of thin vortices without the gauge field @xmath275 .",
    "if we add the u(1 ) gauge field @xmath19 to make the global strings be local ones and introduce the electric field @xmath101 transverse to the strings , from eqs .",
    "( [ emtt])([emhh ] ) we could expect such additions to hinder saturation of the bps limit .",
    "we studied gravitating global d- and df - strings in a d3@xmath11 system in the context of dbi type action of a complex tachyon and a dbi electromagnetic field .",
    "einstein gravity with a vanishing cosmological constant has been assumed and only static straight strings have been considered .    when the electric flux in the transverse direction is turned on , the gravitated straight d - strings stretched along @xmath23-direction form a black string .",

    "the d - strings with the same vorticity lie on both the north and south poles of the two - sphere .",
    "the black string horizon is located on the equator so that the geometry of the horizon is s@xmath277r@xmath278 . from a transverse direction",
    ", fundamental strings also come into both the north and south poles , flow along the latitudes , and go out through the equator to the transverse direction . although we constructed a static black string solution , their stability  @xcite needs to be addressed for the obtained structure of the black strings ( or branes )  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated explicitly and systematically the bps limit for thin d- and df - strings in both flat and curved spacetime .",
    "almost all of the bps properties are shared with nielsen - olesen vortices in the abelian - higgs model and their cosmic analogues , but the pressure components on the @xmath166-plane have a nonvanishing value , @xmath279 , only at each d(f)-string site .",
    "we showed that a gaussian type tachyon potential satisfied the bps sum rule consistent with the descent relation for codimension - two bps d(f)-strings .",
    "our language describing cosmic d- and df - strings was dbi - type action  @xcite .",
    "it would be more intriguing to describe the strings in the context of boundary conformal field theory  @xcite or boundary string field theory  @xcite as has been done for tachyon kinks  @xcite . in the scheme of the dbi - type field theory of d3@xmath0 of our consideration ,",
    "higher - derivative terms have been neglected .",
    "thus , their effect may be tested to check whether or not the obtained bps property is a genuine property of bps d1- or d1f1-branes in the string theory .",
