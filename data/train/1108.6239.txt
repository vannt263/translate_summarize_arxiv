    "the relation between information theory and statistical mechanics of disordered systems has been long stablished @xcite . since then",
    ", various techniques from statistical physics of disordered systems have been used not only to assess the theoretical bounds of the achievable performance but also to provide practical encoding / decoding methods for lossy data compression . in particular ,",
    "both cavity method and replica symmetry breaking techniques have been used to demonstrate the shannon results and assess the performance of codes defined on sparse factor graphs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the classical problem of finding an efficient lossy compression scheme for a generic binary symmetric source .",
    "this objective is reached by exploiting some unexpected features of the cavity method when applied to graphical codes defined over a finite field algebra of high order .",
    "given any realization @xmath4 of a symmetric bernoulli process @xmath5 , the goal is to compress @xmath6 by mapping it to a shorter binary vector such that an approximate reconstruction of @xmath6 is possible within a given fidelity criterion . more precisely ,",
    "suppose @xmath6 is mapped to the binary vector @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the reconstructed source sequence .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is called the compression rate . the fidelity or distortion is measured by the hamming distance @xmath11 .",
    "the goal is to minimize the average hamming distortion @xmath12 $ ] for any given rate .",
    "the asymptotic limit , known as the rate - distortion function , is given by @xmath13 for any @xmath14 $ ] where @xmath15 is the binary entropy function .",
    "our approach in this paper is based on low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes .",
    "let @xmath16 be a ldpc code with @xmath17 generator matrix @xmath18 and @xmath19 parity check matrix @xmath20 .",
    "encoding in lossy compression can be implemented like decoding in error correction . given a source sequence @xmath6",
    ", we look for a codeword @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is minimized . the compressed sequence @xmath23 is obtained as the @xmath24 information bits that satisfy @xmath25 .",
    "even though ldpc codes have been successfully used for various types of lossless data compression schemes @xcite , and also the existence of ensembles that asymptotically achieve the shannon s bound for binary symmetric sources has been proved @xcite , they have not been fully explored for lossy data compression .",
    "it is partially due to the long standing problem of finding a practical source - coding algorithm for ldpc codes , and partially because low - density generator matrix ( ldgm ) codes , as dual of ldpc codes , seemed to be more adapted for source coding and received more attention in the few past years .    in @xcite , martinian and yedidia",
    "show that quantizing a ternary memoryless source coding with erasures is dual of the transmission problem over a binary erasure channel .",
    "they also prove that ldgm codes , as dual of ldpc codes , combined with a modified belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm can saturate the corresponding rate - distortion bound .",
    "following their pioneering work , ldgm codes have been extensively studied for lossy compression by several researchers . in a series of parallel works ,",
    "several researches have used techniques from statistical physics to provide non - rigorous analysis of ldgm codes @xcite . however , ldgm codes seem to perform well only for rates smaller than 0.5 .",
    "as we will see , our proposed ldpc codes perform very near to the rate distortion bound for rates larger than 0.5 . for smaller rates the loss in performance can be compensated by increasing the complexity ( number of iterations ) of our coding scheme .    in terms of practical algorithms ,",
    "lossy compression is still an active research topic . in particular , an asymptotically optimal low complexity compressor with near",
    "optimal empirical performance has not been found yet .",
    "almost all suggested algorithms have been based on some kind of decimation of belief / survey propagation which suffers a computational complexity of @xmath26 @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "one exception is the algorithm proposed by murayama @xcite . when the generator matrix is ultra sparse ( us )",
    ", the algorithm was empirically shown to perform very near to the associated capacity needing @xmath27 computations .",
    "a generalized form of this algorithm , called reinforced belief propagation ( rbp)@xcite , was used in a dual setting @xcite , for ultra sparse ldpc codes ( us - ldpc ) over gf(@xmath28 ) for lossy compression @xcite .",
    "the main drawback in both cases is the non - optimality of ultra sparse structures over gf(@xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "as we will see , this problem can be overcome by increasing the size of the finite field .",
    "estimation of the weight enumerating function show that randomly constructed us - ldpc codes over gf(@xmath0 ) nearly achieve the rate - distortion bound for @xmath29 . despite this , practical encoding for these codes",
    "is a hard task .",
    "the main problem seems to stem from geometrical properties of the configuration space : as the codes are good for channel coding , solutions are isolated and well - separated .",
    "this characteristic is known to make the encoding problem difficult to solve for iterative and local algorithms@xcite . to improve this step we introduce the ensemble of _",
    "b - reduced _ us - ldpc codes , which by eliminating a logarithmic number of constraints from us - ldpc codes , just multiplies the number of codewords by a polynomial .",
    "this change has a negligible effect in the rate , while having a large effect on the performance of the scheme .",
    "indeed , this modification not only improves the convergence of the rbp algorithm on encoding , but also provides us with a simple efficient decoding algorithm .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : ldpcgf(q ) ] reviews the code ensemble which we use for lossy compression .",
    "section [ sec : rbpgf(@xmath0 ) ] describes the rbp algorithm over gf(@xmath0 ) .",
    "we also discuss briefly the complexity and implementation of the rbp algorithm . in section [ sec : ilc ] we describe iterative encoding and decoding for our ensemble and then present the corresponding simulation results in section [ sec : result ] . a brief discussion on further research is given in section [ sec : fr ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the ultra sparse ldpc codes over gf(@xmath0 ) .",
    "as we will see later , near shannon s bound lossy compression is possible using these codes and bp - like iterative algorithms .",
    "we follow the methods and notations in @xcite to construct irregular bipartite factor graphs .",
    "what distinguishes gf(@xmath0 ) ldpc codes from their binary counterparts is that each edge ( @xmath31 ) of the factor graph has a label @xmath32 gf(@xmath0 ) @xmath33 . in other words , the non - zero elements of the parity - check matrix of a gf(@xmath0 ) ldpc codes are chosen from the non - zero elements of the field gf(@xmath0 ) .",
    "denoting the set of variable nodes adjacent to a check node @xmath34 by @xmath35 , a word @xmath36 with components in gf(@xmath0 ) is a codeword if at each check node @xmath34 the equation @xmath37 holds .",
    "an ensemble of gf(@xmath0 ) ldpc codes is characterized by two generating polynomials @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) denotes the fraction of edges incident on variable(check ) nodes of degree @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is maximum variable ( check ) node degree .",
    "a ( @xmath30 ) gf(@xmath0 ) ldpc code can be constructed from a ( @xmath30 ) ldpc code by random independent and identically distributed selection of the matrix coefficients with uniform probability from gf(@xmath0)@xmath44 .",
    "note that this may not be an optimal way for selecting the coefficients .",
    "for more details on code construction and coefficient selection we refer the readers to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the parity check matrix of a gf(@xmath0 ) ldpc code , optimized for binary input channels , is much sparser than the one of a binary ldpc code with same parameters @xcite . in particular , when @xmath45 , the best error rate results on binary input channels is obtained with the lowest possible variable node degrees , i.e. , when almost all variable nodes have degree two .",
    "such codes have been called _ ultra sparse _ or _ cyclic _ ldpc codes in the literature . in the rest of this paper",
    "we call a ldpc code ultra sparse ( us - ldpc ) if all variable nodes have degree two . we will mainly concentrate on codes in which the parity check s degree distribution is concentrated on at most two different degree values , for any given rate .    given a linear code @xmath46 and an integer @xmath47 ,",
    "a @xmath47-reduction of @xmath46 is the code obtained by randomly eliminating @xmath47 parity - check nodes of @xmath46 . for reasons to be cleared in section [ sec : ilc ] , we are mainly interested in @xmath47-reduction of gf(@xmath0 ) us - ldpc codes for small values of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "gf(@xmath0 ) us - ldpc codes have been extensively studied for transmission over noisy channels @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using such codes is twofold . on the one hand , by moving to sufficiently large fields , it is possible to obtain nearly capacity achieving codes . on the other hand ,",
    "the extreme sparseness of the factor graph is well - suited for iterative message - passing decoding algorithms . despite the state of the art performance of moderate length gf(@xmath0 ) us - ldpc channel codes , they have been less studied for lossy compression .",
    "the main reason being the lack of fast suboptimal algorithms . in the next section",
    "we present rbp algorithm over gf(@xmath0 ) and then show that practical encoding for lossy compression is possible by using rbp as the encoding algorithm for the ensemble of @xmath47-reduced us - ldpc codes .",
    "in this section first we briefly review the rbp equations over gf(@xmath0 ) and then we discuss in some details the complexity of the algorithm following declercq and fossorier @xcite .      the gf(@xmath0 ) belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm is a straightforward generalization of the binary case , where the messages are q - dimensional vectors .",
    "let @xmath49 denotes the message vector form variable node @xmath50 to check node @xmath51 at the @xmath52th iteration .",
    "for each symbol @xmath53gf(@xmath0 ) , the @xmath54th component of @xmath49 is the probability that variable @xmath50 takes the value @xmath54 and is denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , @xmath56 denotes the message vector from check node @xmath51 to variable node @xmath50 at the iteration @xmath52 and @xmath57 is its @xmath54th component .",
    "also let @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) denote the set of check ( variable ) nodes adjacent to @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) in a given factor graph .",
    "constants @xmath60 are initialized according to the prior information .",
    "the bp updating rules can be expressed as follows :    * local function to variable : * @xmath61    * variable to local function : * @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the set of all configurations of variables in @xmath59 which satisfy the check node @xmath51 when the value of variable @xmath50 is fixed to @xmath54 .",
    "we define the marginal function of variable @xmath50 at iteration @xmath64 as    @xmath65    the algorithm converges after @xmath66 iterations if and only if for all variables @xmath50 and all function nodes @xmath51 @xmath67 up to some precision @xmath68 . a predefined maximum number of iterations @xmath69 and the precision parameter @xmath68 are the input to the algorithm .",
    "rbp is a generalization of bp in which the messages from variable nodes to check nodes are modified as follows @xmath70 where @xmath71\\longrightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] is a non - decreasing function and @xmath72 is the marginal function of variable @xmath50 at iteration @xmath52 .",
    "the marginals for rbp are defined as    @xmath73    intuitively , rbp equations can be thought as a sort of `` soft - decimation '' procedure .",
    "indeed , in a decimation procedure @xcite , the bp equations are iterated until convergence , and then an infinite external field with the same sign of the local field is applied to one or more variables and the process is repeated ( until all variables receive an infinite field ) . in the rbp procedure ,",
    "every variable receives a finite external field which is proportional to its own local field ( the proportionality factor being @xmath74 ) .",
    "moreover , the two time - scales ( convergence and external field update ) are intermixed .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath75 to be @xmath76 where @xmath77 are in @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "note that when @xmath79 , rbp is the same as the algorithm presented in @xcite for lossy data compression . in this case",
    "it is easy to show that the only fixed points of rbp are configurations that satisfy all the constraints .      ignoring the normalization factor in ( [ spvar2func ] ) , to compute all variable to check - node messages at a variable node of degree @xmath42 we need @xmath80 computations . a naive implementation of gf(@xmath0 )",
    "bp has computational complexity of @xmath81 operations at each check node of degree @xmath82 .",
    "this high complexity is mainly due to the sum in ( [ spfunc2var ] ) , that can be interpreted as a discrete convolution of probability density functions .",
    "efficient implementations of function to variable node messages based on discrete fourier transform ( dft ) have been proposed by several authors , see for example and the references within .",
    "the procedure consists in using the identity @xmath83 where the @xmath84 symbol denotes convolution of functions over @xmath85 , and the product on the right - hand side is the pointwise product of real - valued functions .",
    "assuming @xmath86 , the fourier transform of each message @xmath87 needs @xmath88 computations and hence the total computational complexity at check node @xmath51 can be reduced into @xmath89 .",
    "this complexity can be further reduced to @xmath90 by using the fact that @xmath91 , or alternatively by using the summation strategy described in @xcite which has the same complexity but is numerically more stable .",
    "therefore , the total number of computations per iteration is @xmath92 where @xmath2 is the average check - node degree .",
    "a prototipe c++ implementation of these equations is provided in source form @xcite .",
    "in the following three subsections we first describe a simple method for identifying information bits of a @xmath47-reduced us - ldpc code and then present a near optimal scheme for iterative compression ( encoding ) and linear decompression ( decoding ) .      for @xmath47-reduced us - ldpc codes",
    ", one can use the _ leaf removal _ ( lr ) algorithm to find the information bits in linear time . in the rest of this section",
    "we briefly review the lr algorithm and show that 1-reduction ( removal of a sole check node ) of a us - ldpc code significantly changes the intrinsic structure of the factor graph of the original code .",
    "the main idea behind lr algorithm is that a variable on a leaf of a factor graph can be fixed in such a way that the check node to which it is connected is satisfied @xcite . given a factor graph , lr starts from a leaf and removes it as well as the check node it is connected to .",
    "lr continues this process until no leaf remains .",
    "the residual sub - graph is called the _ core_. note that the core is independent of the order in which leaves ( and hence the corresponding check nodes ) are removed from the factor graph .",
    "this implies that also the number of steps needed to find the core does not depend on the order on which leaves are chosen .",
    "while us - ldpc codes have a complete core , i.e. there is no leaf in their factor graph , the @xmath47-reduction of these codes have empty core .",
    "our simulations also indicate that even 1-reduction of a code largely improves the encoding under rbp algorithm ( see section [ sec : result ] ) .",
    "how rbp exploits this property is the subject of ongoing research .",
    "as we have mentioned , the lr algorithm can be also used to find a set of information bits of a given us - ldpc code .",
    "let us examine the lr algorithm in more detail . at any step @xmath66 of lr algorithm ,",
    "a leaf variable node @xmath93 attached to a factor node @xmath94 is selected .",
    "denote by @xmath95 the remaining leaf variable nodes attached to check node @xmath94 ( @xmath95 could be empty if there are no other leaves attached to it ) .",
    "now we remove check node @xmath94 and leaf nodes in @xmath96 , and repeat . under the hypothesis",
    "that the original graph was connected , this process is guarateed to finish at some time @xmath97 with the empty graph , as at each step except the last one , at least one leaf is created .",
    "it is easy to see that at each step , if we fix the values of all variables except those in @xmath98 , then for each configuration of variables in @xmath95 , the value of variable @xmath93 is uniquely determined .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 will form a set of information bits . indeed , using the ordering of the variable indices @xmath100 , the check matrix becomes upper triangular and each solution can be found by back substitution in linear time once information bits are fixed .",
    "suppose a code of rate @xmath101 and a source sequence @xmath6 is given . in order to find the codeword @xmath9 that minimizes @xmath102",
    ", we will employ the rbp algorithm with a strong prior @xmath103 centered around @xmath6 .",
    "the sequence of information bits of @xmath9 is the compressed sequence and is denoted by @xmath23 . in order to process the encoding in gf(@xmath0 ) , we first need to map @xmath6 into a sequence in gf(@xmath0 ) .",
    "this can be simply done by grouping @xmath104 bits together and use the binary representation of the symbols in gf(@xmath0 ) .      given the sequence of information bits @xmath23 ,",
    "the goal of the decoder is to find the corresponding codeword @xmath9 .",
    "this can be done by calculating the @xmath105 which in general needs @xmath26 computations .",
    "one of the advantages of our scheme is that it allows for a linear complexity iterative decoding .",
    "the decoding can be performed by iteratively fixing variables following the inverse steps of the lr algorithm ; at each step @xmath66 only one non - information bit is unknown ( variable @xmath93 ) and its value can be determined from the parity check @xmath94 . for a sparse parity - check matrix ,",
    "the number of needed operations is @xmath27 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that a code has empty core if and only if there exists a permutation of columns of the corresponding parity - check matrix @xmath20 such that @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",
    "the decoding procedure is equivalent to back - substitution on this permutated triangular matrix .",
    "given an initial vector @xmath6 , and a probability distribution @xmath110 over all configurations , the @xmath111-average distance from @xmath6 can be computed by    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the set of marginals of @xmath111 . on the other hand , the entropy of the distribution @xmath111 is defined by    @xmath114    even though it is a hard problem to calculate analytically both marginals and @xmath115 of a given code , one may approximate them using messages of the bp algorithm at a fixed point @xcite . assuming the normalized distance is asymptotically a self - averaging quantity for our ensemble , @xmath115 represents the logarithm of the number of codeword at distance @xmath116 from @xmath6 . by applying a prior distribution on codewords given by @xmath117 one",

    "this hypothesis can be corroborated by comparing the plot in figure [ fig : wef ] with the simulation results we obtained by using rbp algorithm ( figure [ fig : qperformace ] ) .",
    "for the simplicity of the analysis , in all our simulations the parameter @xmath119 of rbp algorithm is fixed to one and therefore the function @xmath75 is constant .",

    "we would like to add a few words to the role of @xmath47-reduction .",
    "for simplicity , let us concentrate on @xmath133 , though the argument is general .",
    "first note that by removing a parity check node from a code , the number of codewords is doubled .",
    "this increment has an asymptotically negligible effect on the compression rate since it only increases by @xmath140 , while the robustness may increase .",
    "more generally , it is possible to significantly alter the geometry of the solution space while maintaining ( asymptotically ) the compression rate : for instance , adding a path \\{@xmath141 } of new codewords from each codeword @xmath36 of a given code to the codeword @xmath142 , such that @xmath143 and @xmath144 , multiplies the number of codewords by at most @xmath3 and thus increases the rate by at most @xmath145 which is asymptotically negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "the codeword space becomes `` star - shaped '' and thus connected on the hypercube geometry .",
    "note that such modified codes may be terrible for channel coding , as the separation properties may have been severely worsened ( e.g. the minimum distance of the code becomes @xmath146 ) .",
    "we think that a similar phenomenon could take place on @xmath47-reduced codes . on the one hand , the asymptotic rate for source coding under the proposed scheme",
    "is only increased by @xmath147 and the performance assuming map encoding can only improve . on the other hand , we believe that the implied modification of the geometry could ease the task of our iterative encoder .",
    "indeed , it is well known that large separation between solutions makes the problem very hard for iterative and local algorithms @xcite . in the following we briefly explain some asymptotic implications of 1-reduction on weight enumerating function of the us - ldpc code ensemble .",
    "as we have mentioned , cancelling a single check node increases the the cardinality of the code by the factor @xmath0 .",

    "a cluster of new codewords emerges for each codeword @xmath36 . in order to see this fact ,",

    "the checknode @xmath54 and both variables @xmath50 and @xmath150 belong to a loop of length @xmath151 of the original factor graph as @xmath152 . after removing @xmath54 ,",
    "this loop is broken and for any codeword of the original factor graph one can obtain new codewords by assigning to @xmath50 any value from the finite field and changing accordingly the values of all variables in the broken loop .",
    "note that this can be done because all variables in the broken loop have degree two and @xmath150 can be adjusted to satisfy the last checknode in the path from @xmath50 to @xmath150 .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to provide a low complexity coding scheme for lossy data compression with near rate - distortion bound performance .",
    "we propose a practical iterative encoding / decoding scheme that exploits the geometrical structure of the so called reduced ultra sparse low density parity check codes .",
    "our proposed algorithm for encoding can be considered as a soft decimation strategy for belief propagation algorithm .",
    "the complexity per iteration at the iterative encoder depends linearly on both the length of the code and the order of the field on which the code is defined .",
    "the decoding algorithm is based on leaf removal algorithm which has linear complexity on the proposed sparse factor graphs .",
    "we have investigated the behaviour of our scheme for various field orders and parameters of the proposed algorithm .",
    "in particular , we approximately calculate the weight enumerating function of us - ldpc codes as a function of field order using the bp algorithm .",
    "our estimations show that us - ldpc codes over gf(@xmath0 ) nearly achieve the rate - distortion bound for @xmath29 .",
    "though bp is not exact over loopy graphs , we conjecture that the wef calculated for us - ldpc codes is asymptotically exact .",
    "this hypothesis is corroborated by the simulation results we obtained by using rbp algorithm .",
    "our research can be expanded in several directions .",
    "for example , it is interesting to study other ultra sparse ensembles sharing similar properties , e.g. where just a certain fraction of variable nodes of degree one is allowed .",
    "several directions could be explored in order to obtain more efficient coding schemes : other choices of the reinforcement rate @xmath74 , choices of random codes and coefficient selection , and a @xmath153 version of the encoder along the lines of @xcite as it could allow much lower computational complexity .",
    "work is in progress in these direction .",
    "the authors wish to thank guido montorsi and abolfazl ramezanpour for valuable suggestions and useful discussions .",
