    "one of the open questions of high energy physics is how to unify gravity with quantum physics .",
    "a lot of effort has been devoted to develop a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "this theory is likely to require a drastic modification of our current understanding of the space - time . at present",
    "there are two formal mathematical approaches : loop quantum gravity and superstring theory .",
    "whatever might be the right description of the space - time at very short scales , there are some likely physical manifestations .",
    "it has been suggested , for instance , that such a theory would break what we believe to be basic symmetries of nature . in @xcite , it was shown that einstein lagrangian allows for large fluctuations of the metric and the topology of the space - time on scales of order of the planck length , creating a foam - like structure at these scales .",
    "it has been proposed that the propagation of particles in a foamy space - time is strongly affected on short scales . the medium responds differently depending on the energy of the particle , in analogy with the propagation through a conventional electromagnetic plasma @xcite .",
    "thus space - time might exhibit a non - trivial dispersion relation in vacuum , violating therefore lorentz invariance .",
    "there are many different ways of breaking lorentz symmetry ; a background tensor field , like a magnetic field , breaks the vacuum rotational invariance , for instance .",
    "however , it has been shown that there are 46 different ways in which the standard model lagrangian can be modified while remaining renormalizable , invariant under @xmath1 and rotationally and translationally invariant in a preferred frame @xcite . among other effects ,",
    "these terms cause the velocity of light to differ from the maximum attainable velocity of a particle , therefore changing the kinematics of particle decays . modifying the dispersion relations of photons and electrons",
    "allows for new qed vertex interactions like photon splitting in vacuum , vacuum erenkov effect for electrons , photon decay , electron - positron annihilation to a single photon , etc . @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider only rotationally invariant deformations of the photon dispersion relation which produce an energy - dependent speed of light . if this effect is present in nature , it has to be absent below some energy scale , @xmath2 , ( where @xmath0 is the planck energy and @xmath3 a dimensionless constant ) , high enough to have been undetected so far . traditionally this energy is believed to be the planck energy which , at first , seems to make hopeless any experimental attempt to test these models .",
    "however , in 1997 amelino - camelia et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that such models can be explored by studying the propagation of photons emitted from a distance source like a gamma ray burst ( grb ) grbs are short and intense pulses of soft gamma rays that arrive from cosmological distances from random directions in the sky .",
    "the bursts last from a fraction of a second to several hundred seconds .",
    "most grbs are narrowly beamed with typical energies around @xmath4 ergs , making them comparable to supernovae ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "because of the large distances traveled by the photons , these bursts are valuable tools to explore energies far beyond the reach of any laboratory on earth .",
    "if one considers photons with energies much smaller than the symmetry breaking scale , it is possible to expand the dispersion relation in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "the first correction produces a tiny departure from the lorentz invariant ( li ) equations and we expect that the low energy limit of the deformed dispersion relation can be written generically as : e^2 - p^2 c^2 e^2 ( e m_pl ) ^n , [ mod - dis - rel ] where @xmath6 takes into account the possibility of having either infraluminal or superluminal motion , the latter appearing in some models of quantum loop gravity @xcite .",
    "photons simultaneously emitted from a grb with different energies will travel at different speeds , and therefore will show on earth a time delay .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore these high energy lorentz violation models by studying such time delays .",
    "we analyze the potential of detecting observational consequences of a modified dispersion relation like eq .",
    "[ mod - dis - rel ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; in section [ stand - th ] we review cosmological photon propagation in the li theory and show how these results are modified when a non li term is introduced .",
    "we compute the travel time of cosmological photons and , as a check , compare it with the travel time obtained in the newtonian approximation .",
    "in section [ det - photons ] we turn to the observations and show how such models can be tested using grb observations .",

    "the hamiltonian depends explicitly on @xmath10 through @xmath11 , expressing the fact that the momentum is redshifted due to the cosmological expansion .",
    "the trajectory of the particle is x(t , p ) = , p = .",
    "[ distance ] for a massless particle , like a photon , eq . [ distance ] becomes a x = c .",
    "hence the speed of photons is an universal constant , @xmath12 , which does not depend on the energy .    when lorentz symmetry is broken this result is modified .",

    "while the reason for this phenomenon is not understood , an anti - correlation between the spectral evolution timescale and the peak luminosity has been found @xcite .",
    "there are two different ways to deal with the intrinsic delay .",
    "the first is to try to reduce it by choosing very luminous bursts and observing in mev or higher , where the delay , if still exists , seems to be smaller .",
    "the second approach is based on the fact that the delays produced by a violation of lorentz symmetry increase with the redshift of the source , whereas intrinsic time delays are independent of the redshift of the source @xcite .",
    "thus , a systematic comparison of a delays in a group of bursts with known redshifts could enable us to distinguish between intrinsic and redshift dependent delays .",
    "using a sample of 35 bursts with known redshifts , ellis et al .",
    "@xcite established a lower limit of @xmath145 on the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "these bounds are two orders of magnitude lower than our theoretical limits .",
    "this difference demonstrates the importance that intrinsic time delays , noise and the real instrumental resolution can have .",
    "our goal was to explore the potential of grbs to set bounds on lorentz violation and to find optimal techniques to do so .",
    "we modified the dispersion relation of photons by adding an extra term proportional to the photon momentum to the power @xmath146 .",
    "we have shown that in models with @xmath61 it is possible to explore energies which are close to the planck energy .",
    "when @xmath88 , the energies explored are smaller , around @xmath147 gev .",
    "these bounds are idealized and they do not take into account experimental limitations or the intrinsic time - structure of the @xmath148-ray emission .",
    "they should serve as theoretical estimations of what can be achieved .",
    "the methodology we use here can be used to design future optimal experiments for observing this effect ( or setting bounds on it ) .",
    "we have modelled the burst high energy emission with a power law spectrum @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "this fits well the time integrated emission of most of the bursts .",
    "we found two non intuitive results : ( i ) the optimal redshift to set the strongest bound is less than 1 .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath61 , low energy , rather than high energy emission is preferred .",
    "both results are counter - intuitive since the lorentz violation delay increases with the distance and with the energy",
    ". however , distance or observations at high energies ( where the flux is lower ) dilute the photons reducing the temporal resolution achieved on earth .",
    "it turns out that this is the dominant effect .    in the models with @xmath88 , going to higher energies",
    "always improves the bounds . here",
    "the situation will be remarkably changed when the spatial observatory glast will become operational .",
    "we have also investigated the probability of improving the current experimental bounds , given a phenomenological luminosity and space distribution of bursts .",
    "as we are discussing idealized bounds , this probability should only be trusted up to an order of magnitude .",
