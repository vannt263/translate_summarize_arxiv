    "the casimir effect @xcite is the direct manifectation of zero - point oscillations of quantized fields .",
    "it finds multidisciplinary applications in quantum field theory , gravitation and cosmology , atomic physics , condensed matter and , most recently , in nanotechnology ( see , e.g. , the monographs @xcite and reviews @xcite ) . according to casimir s prediction",
    ", the existence of zero - point oscillations leads to the polarization of vacuum in quantization volumes restricted by material boundaries and in spaces with non - euclidean topology .",
    "this is accompanied by forces acting on the boundary surfaces ( the so called casimir force ) .",
    "the casimir force acts between electrically neutral closely spaced surfaces .",
    "it is a pure quantum phenomenon ( there is no such a force in the framework of classical electrodynamics ) being the generalization of the well known van der waals force for the case of relatively large separations where relativistic effects become essential .",
    "the theoretical basis for the description of both the van der waals and casimir forces is given by the lifshitz theory @xcite .",
    "the main formulas of the lifshitz theory express the free energy and pressure of the van der waals and casimir interaction between two plane parallel plates as some functionals of the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities of plate materials .",
    "these formulas can be derived in many different theoretical schemes @xcite . in particular , they were obtained in the framework of thermal quantum field theory in the matsubara formulation @xcite . during the last few years the lifshitz theory was successfully applied to the interpretation of many measurements of the casimir force between metal surfaces @xcite and between metal and semiconductor @xcite .",
    "a complicated problem of the lifshitz theory is how to describe the casimir interaction between real metals at nonzero temperature .",
    "the most convenient form of the lifshitz formulas exploits the dielectric permittivity along the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "the latter is obtained from the tabulated optical data for the complex index of refraction by means of the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "the available data are , however , insufficient and must be extrapolated in some way to lower frequencies . in this respect the contribution from the zero frequency is of most concern .",
    "the point is that in matsubara thermal field theory the zero - frequency term becomes dominant at large separations ( high temperatures ) whereas the contributions from all other matsubara frequencies being exponentially small . in @xcite the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula",
    "was obtained by using the dielectric function of the drude model .",
    "this results in a violation of the nernst heat theorem in the case of perfect crystal lattices @xcite and is in contradiction with experiments at separations below 1@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic value of the casimir force at large separations predicted in @xcite is equal to one half of the value predicted for ideal metals , i.e. , to one half of the so called classical limit @xcite .",
    "another approach @xcite uses the dielectric permittivity of the plasma model to determine the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula .",
    "this approach was shown to be in agreement with thermodynamics @xcite and consistent with experiment @xcite .",
    "it predicts the magnitudes of the casimir force at short separations in qualitative agreement with the case of ideal metals . at large separations",
    "the predicted force magnitude is practically equal to that for ideal metals .",
    "very similar results , which are also in agreement with the requirements of thermodynamics and consistent with experiment , are predicted by the surface impedance approach @xcite .",
    "the controversies among different approaches to the thermal casimir force between metals are detailly discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently it was demonstrated @xcite that even the traditional application of the lifshitz formula to the case of two dielectric semispaces presents problems . in @xcite",
    "the analytic asymptotic expressions for the casimir free energy , pressure and entropy at low temperatures ( short separations ) were found for two dielectrics .",
    "it was shown that if the dielectric materials possess finite static dielectric permittivities the theory is self - consistent and in agreement with thermodynamics .",
    "if , however , a nonzero dc conductivity of dielectrics is taken into account ( any dielectric at nonzero temperature is characterized by some nonzero dc conductivity which is many orders of magnitude lower than for metals ) , this leads to a qualitative enhancement of the casimir force and a simultaneous violation of the nernst heat theorem .",
    "( note that the dc conductivity of dielectrics was taken into account in @xcite to explain the large observed effect in noncontact friction @xcite . ) in @xcite the phenomenological prescription was proposed that the dc conductivity of dielectrics is not related to the casimir interaction , and to avoid contradictions with thermodynamics it should not be included in the model of dielectric response .",
    "the difficulties which were met in the application of the lifshitz theory to two metal and two dielectric plates attracted attention to the case when one plate is metallic and another one dielectric .",
    "this configuration was first considered in @xcite .",
    "it presents the interesting opportunity to investigate the casimir force in the case when different plates are described by quite different models of the dielectric response . in @xcite , however , only the first leading terms in the low - temperature asymptotic expressions for the casimir free energy and entropy were obtained , and the pressure was derived only in the dilute approximation . in the analytical derivations in @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) it was supposed that the metallic plate is made of ideal metal and the dielectric of the other plate is described by the frequency independent dielectric permittivity .",
    "these suppositions narrow the applicability of the obtained results .",
    "also , the role of the dc conductivity of a dielectric plate was not investigated for plates with frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities .    in the present paper",
    "we develop the analytic approach to the thermal casimir force acting between metal and dielectric permitting to find several expansion terms in the asymptotic expressions for all physical quantities at low temperature .",
    "this approach is applied not only to the configuration of ideal metal and dielectric with frequency independent dielectric permittivity but also to real metal and dielectric described by the dielectric permittivities depending on frequency .",
    "we pioneer in derivation of the low - temperature asymptotic expressions for the casimir free energy , entropy and pressure between real metal and dielectric .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of all physical quantities at high temperatures ( large separations ) is also provided . what is more , the obtained representation for the casimir free energy permits to find the low - temperature behavior of the casimir force acting between a metal sphere and a dielectric plate ( or , alternatively , dielectric sphere above a metal plate ) .",
    "this can be done with the help of the proximity force theorem @xcite .",
    "the configuration of a sphere above a plate is most topical in experiments on the measurement of the casimir force @xcite .",
    "( note that for the experimental parameters the error introduced by the use of the proximity force theorem was recently shown to be less than 0.1% @xcite . )",
    "thus , our results will find immediate utility in experiment .",
    "the analytic expressions for the casimir interaction between metal and dielectric at zero temperature are also found here for the first time .",
    "we determine the applicability region of the obtained analytic formulas by compairing them with numerical computations using the tabulated optical data for metallic and dielectric materials .",
    "the fundamental conclusion following from our results is that the lifshitz theory , applied to the configuration of a metal and a dielectric plate , is in agreement with the nernst heat theorem if the static dielectric permittivity of a dielectric plate is finite .",
    "note that this conclusion could not be achieved by using the numerical computations which inevitably identify zero with all nonzero numbers in the limits of a computational error .",
    "if , however , the dc conductivity of a dielectric plate is included in the model of dielectric response , we show that the nernst heat theorem is violated .",
    "this is in analogy to the same conclusion in @xcite obtained for the configuration of two dielectric plates and confirms our phenomenological prescription that the dc conductivity is not related to the van der waals and casimir forces and should not be included in the model of dielectric response .",
    "recently this prescription was confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we summarize the main formulas of the lifshitz theory for the configuration of one plate made of metal and another one made of dielectric .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the simplified model where the metal is an ideal one and dielectric is described by a constant dielectric permittivity . in the framework of this model a perturbation formalism applicable at low temperatures ( short separations ) is developed . in section  4 the realistic case",
    "is considered when the dielectric permittivities of both metal and dielectric plates depend on the frequency .",
    "the analytic asymptotic expressions for the free energy , entropy and pressure of the casimir interaction at both low and high temperatures are obtained .",
    "section  5 contains the comparison between the analytical results and numerical computations using the tabulated optical data for plate materials .",

    "different models of the dielectric response for both metal and dielectric were considered : the simplified model of an ideal metal and dielectric with constant dielectric permittivity , and the realistic model of a metal described by the plasma model and a dielectric described in the ninham - parsegian representation for @xmath205 . to derive the asymptotic expressions at low temperatures , the perturbation theory in the small parameter @xmath87",
    "was developed which is proportional to the product of separation distance and the temperature .",
    "the analytic expressions for the main physical quantities in the limit of high temperatures and at zero temperature were also obtained .",
    "the analytic results were compared with numerical computations using the lifshitz formula and tabulated optical data , and good agreement was found .",
    "the fundamental conclusion arrived in the paper is that the lifshitz theory applied to the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate is in agreement with thermodynamics if the dielectric permittivity of a dielectric plate at zero frequency is finite . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the casimir entropy goes to zero when the temperature vanishes , i.e. , the nernst heat theorem is satisfied .",
    "this conclusion can not be reached numerically , because it is impossible to perform numerical computations at arbitrarily low temperature and their precision is always restricted . on the contrary , it was shown that , if the dielectric permittivity of the dielectric plate at zero frequency turns to infinity ( i.e. , small dc conductivity of a dielectric material is taken into account ) , this leads to a nonzero value of the casimir entropy at zero temperature , i.e. , to a violation of the nernst heat theorem .",
    "the inclusion of the dc conductivity of high - resistivity semiconductors in the model of dielectric response was also recently shown to be in contradiction with experiment @xcite .",
    "what this means is that to avoid contradictions with thermodynamics and experiment , one should not include the actual conductivity properties of dielectric materials at very low , quasistatic , frequencies into the model of the dielectric response ( this phenomenological prescription was obtained previously in @xcite for the case of two dielectric plates made of real materials ) .",
    "the above conclusions can be discussed in the context of the formalism of thermal quantum field theory in matsubara formulation where the zero - frequency term plays a separated role and calls for an adequate interpretation .",
    "it is common knowledge that the zero - point energy of quantized fields contains oscillations of any frequency .",
    "it would be hard , however , to imagine the presence of a zero - frequency ( i.e. , constant ) field in the vacuum state .",
    "this suggests that the zero - frequency term in the matsubara summation could be understood not literally but as a mathematical limit to zero from the region of much higher frequencies [ the characteristic frequency of the casimir effect @xmath249 , and the thermal frequency @xmath250 which determine the physical phenomena of the van der waals and casimir forces . as was discussed below eq .",
    "( [ eq72 ] ) , in the region of characteristic and thermal frequencies the effects of dc conductivity contribute twelve orders of magnitude less than @xmath251 .",
    "because of this , the dc conductivity may be considered as not related to the casimir forces and be not included into the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula .",
    "this phenomenological prescription is not the fundamental resolution of the problem , which remains unknown , but following it one avoids contradictions to thermodynamics and experiment .",
    "note that the problems discussed above for the configuration of metal - dielectric are of different nature than those arising for two metals . for metals",
    "the concentration of charge carriers only slightly depends on the temperature .",
    "the validity of the nernst heat theorem in the casimir interaction between two metals is caused by the scattering processes of free charge carriers on phonons , impurities etc .",
    "for the perfect drude metals with no impurities , relaxation goes to zero when the temperature vanishes and the nernst heat theorem is violated @xcite . on the contrary , for dielectrics the concentration of charge carriers quickly decreases to zero when the temperature vanishes . here",
    "the violation of the nernst heat theorem does not depend on the scattering processes and is caused by the inclusion of the infinitely large dc conductivity . in the formalism , for two metals a discontinuity in the reflection coefficient of the transverse electric mode at zero frequency arises , whereas for a metal and dielectric a discontinuity holds in the reflection coefficient of the transverse magnetic mode .",
    "these differences are reflected in the fact that even the sign of the entropy at @xmath108 for two perfect drude metals and for one metal and one dielectric with included dc conductivity are opposite ( negative for two metals and positive for a metal and dielectric ) .",
    "the obtained results are topical for the interpretation of recent measurements of the casimir force between metal sphere and semiconductor plate @xcite .",
    "semiconductors suggest a wide variety of the conductivity properties ranging from metallic to dielectric ones . in the application of the lifshitz theory to the metal - semiconductor test bodies the model of the dielectric response for a semiconductor",
    "should be chosen to satisfy the nernst heat theorem and other fundamental physical principles .",
    "this can be done by using the proposed phenomenological prescription .",
    "a more fundamental resolution of the discussed problems may go beyond the scope of the lifshitz theory .",
