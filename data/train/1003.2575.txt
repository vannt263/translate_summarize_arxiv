    "in the weak gravitational field such as solar system , there are many experiments and the validity of general relativity ( gr ) has been shown , while the gravitational theory in the strong field regime are still unconstrained by the observations",
    ". however , the development of technology will be possible to observe compact objects with high accuracy and those observations could be used as a direct test of the gravitational theory in strong field regime @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are attempts to test the gravitational theory by using surface atomic line redshifts @xcite or gravitational waves emitted from the neutron stars @xcite . in these works",
    ", they suggest the possibility to distinguish the scalar - tensor theory proposed in @xcite from gr .    as an alternative gravitational theory , the tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory",
    "has attracted considerable attention , which is proposed originally by bekenstein @xcite as a covariant theory for modified newtonian dynamics @xcite ( see @xcite for review of teves ) . the advantage to adopt",
    "this theory is possible to explain the galaxy rotational curves and the tully - fisher law without the existence of dark matter @xcite .",
    "additionally , teves has successfully explained not only strong gravitational lensing @xcite but also the galaxy distribution through an evolving universe without cold dark matter @xcite . in the strong gravitational region of teves ,",
    "the schwarzschild solution was found by giannios @xcite , and the reissner - nordstrm solution was found by sagi and bekenstein @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lasky et al . derived the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations in teves and they produced the static , spherically symmetric neutron star models in teves @xcite .",
    "recently , there are some suggestions to distinguish teves from gr by using some observations , i.e. , with the redshift of the atomic spectral lines radiated from the surface of neutron star @xcite , with the shapiro delays of gravitational waves and photons or neutrinos @xcite , and with the emitted gravitational waves from neutron stars @xcite . in this article",
    ", we examine the different way to distinguish teves from gr , i.e. , the rotational effect around neutron stars . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider the slowly rotating neutron stars with a uniform angular velocity . the analysis of slowly rotating neutron star in gr has originally done by hartle @xcite , and subsequently many works have done in this field . actually , taking into account the rotational effect is more natural and more important . for example , due to the rotational effect , the new oscillation family , i.e. , so - called @xmath1 mode , could be excited @xcite .",
    "so , this article would become a first step to consider the rotational effect in more complicated system in teves .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the fundamental parts of teves and the equations to produce the non - rotating relativistic stellar models in teves , which are corresponding to tov equations in gr . in section [ sec : iii ] , we derive the equations to describe the slowly rotating relativistic stars . in order to discuss about the slowly rotating star models in teves , as mentioned later , two variables are required , i.e. , one is the variable shown the frame dragging and the other is the vector field induced by the rotation . in this section , we also show the numerical results for many stellar models . at",
    "last , we make a conclusion in section [ sec : iv ] . in this article",
    ", we adopt the unit of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath5 .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the fundamental parts of teves , which are necessary for the calculations in this article ( see for the details of this theory in @xcite ) .",
    "teves is constructed with three dynamical gravitational fields , i.e. , an einstein metric @xmath6 , a timelike 4-vector field @xmath7 , and a scalar field @xmath8 , in addition to a nondynamical scalar field @xmath9 .",
    "the vector field fulfills the normalization condition , @xmath10 , and the physical metric is given by @xmath11 along which usual matter such as electromagnetic fields propagate .",
    "hereafter , all quantities in the physical frame are denoted with a tilde , and any quantity without a tilde is in the einstein frame .",
    "the total action of teves , @xmath12 , contains contributions from the three dynamical fields and a matter contribution , i.e. , the einstein - hilbert action , @xmath13 , the vector field s action , @xmath14 , the scalar s action , @xmath15 , and the matter action , @xmath16 .",
    "these four parts of action can be written down as @xmath17}{\\cal u}_{[\\beta,\\nu]}\\right)-\\frac{2\\lambda}{k}\\left(g^{\\mu\\nu}{\\cal u}_\\mu{\\cal u}_\\nu+1\\right)\\right]\\sqrt{-g}d^4x } , \\\\   s_s = & -\\frac{1}{2k^2\\ell^2g}\\int{f(k\\ell^2h^{\\alpha\\beta}\\varphi_{,\\alpha}\\varphi_{,\\beta})\\sqrt{-g}d^4x } , \\\\   s_m = & \\int{{\\cal l}\\left(\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu},f^\\alpha , f^\\alpha_{|\\mu},\\cdots\\right)\\sqrt{-\\tilde{g}}d^4x},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18}\\equiv{\\cal u}_{\\alpha,\\beta}-{\\cal u}_{\\beta,\\alpha}$ ] , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath0 are positive dimensionless parameters associated with the scalar and vector fields respectively , @xmath21 is a dimensionless free function , @xmath22 is a constant length scale , @xmath23 is a spacetime dependent lagrange multiplier , @xmath24 denotes the field variables collectively , and the covariant derivative denoted by @xmath25 is taken with respect to @xmath26 ( see @xcite for details ) .    although the free function , @xmath21 , is not predicted by the theory , as mentioned later our results in this article are independent of this function and therefore our results are also independent from the value of @xmath22 .",
    "the scalar field coupling , @xmath20 , has been constrained by bekenstein @xcite to be @xmath27 by using planetary motions in the outer solar system .",
    "while , the restrictions on the vector field coupling , @xmath0 , are less severe , but probably one should consider the range of @xmath28 , because for @xmath29 one can show that the stellar pressure diverges from the stellar center outward and one can not construct the stellar models @xcite . additionally , the lagrange multiplier , @xmath23 , can be described as a function of field variables from the vector equation with the normalization condition ( see eq.([lambda00 ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , we should notice about the propagation speed .",
    "that is , bekenstein showed that teves allows for superluminal propagation of tensor , vector , and scalar perturbations when @xmath30 @xcite . using perturbations of the various fields in the physical frame ,",
    "this statement was shown and was independent of the matter content of the model .",
    "thus , in order to avoid the violating causality , the scalar field should not be negative .",
    "namely , one should construct the neutron star model keeping that the scalar field be everywhere greater than or equal to zero . with this condition , the cosmological value of scalar field , @xmath31 ,",
    "can be constrained as @xmath32 @xcite .    by varying the total action , with respect to @xmath33 ,",

    "strictly speaking , in the asymptotic region , the assumption that @xmath47 might not be good , but we set the numerical boundary to be @xmath49 in this article and the results are independent from the position of numerical boundary if the numerical boundary set to be far from @xmath49 .",

    "<S> in order to examine the rotational effect around neutron star in tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory , we consider the slowly rotating relativistic stars with a uniform angular velocity . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we find that similar to the case in general relativity ( gr ) , the angular momentum is proportional to the angular velocity . additionally , as the value of coupling constant @xmath0 becomes higher , the frame dragging in teves becomes quite different distribution from that in gr , where we can also see the deviation even in the interior of star . while with smaller value of @xmath0 , although the frame dragging approaches to that expected in gr , the induced vector field due to the rotation does not vanish and still exists . </S>",
    "<S> thus , through the observations associated with relativistic object , one could be possible to distinguish the gravitational theory in strong field regime even in the case that the value of coupling constant @xmath0 is quite small . </S>"
