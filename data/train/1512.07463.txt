    "this property can be used in modification of local emission properties , increasing efficiency of absorption , and many biological applications @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the large non - radiative losses in such metal particles discourage their use in bulk materials for many applications .",
    "hence , discovering useful optical properties in non - plasmonic nanostructures is a significant direction of research in developing nanoscale materials @xcite .",
    "one path in realizing new useful optical properties is the strong excitation of higher order modes of nanostructures like nanoshells @xcite .",
    "studies of layered nanospheres with an absorbing layer or core were motivated by meteorological applications many decades before the advent of plasmonics @xcite .",
    "more recently , tunable properties of plasmonics core - shell nanostructures have been studied for applications where low quality factors and dissipative losses are not an impediment .",
    "non - intuitive properties of magnetic spheres like a negligible back - scattering efficiency were predicted decades ago , @xcite and recent experimental observations of certain cylindrical oligomers confirm such behavior @xcite . but studies of dielectric particles have been mostly limited to large cylindrical and spherical microstructures for optical fiber communication and optical cavities that exploit whispering gallery modes , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that an interference structure in the extinction spectrum of homogeneous particles on the order of wavelength has been well - known @xcite .",
    "this was understood as the spectral maxima and minima representing the interference of forward - scattered light and incident light , and this effect has been used in micro - wave signal processing before@xcite .",
    "also , an asymmetric optical resonance for particles was predicted by van de hulst earlier than its quantum - mechanical counterpart@xcite and such a resonance was experimentally observed using nanospheres with a sharp absorption spectrum @xcite before fano resonances became well - known in plasmonics .",
    "plasmonic particles offer the possibility of sharp changes in the optical spectra when two different mode numbers are coupled strongly by the dissipative currents .    however , we highlight that strong optical effects can be derived even in dielectric nanoshells with dimensions on the order of , but less than , wavelength of incident light _ i.e",

    "transparencies where the optical efficiency of a large nanoparticle reduces to unity due to a minimal interaction with the incident field are equally significant spectral regions @xcite .",
    "we show that interference occur between the complementary normal modes of the nanoshell and core regions , due to large phase shifts relative to each other , in many mode numbers .",
    "in other spectral regions , the optical properties are not remarkably different from that of dielectric homogeneous spheres @xcite .",
    "note that this is accompanied by directional scattering typically in forward or backward directions and hence a useful property for optical antennas@xcite .",
    "this classical behavior has interesting quantum - mechanical interpretations as discussed later , and is potentially conducive to single - photon communication applications .",

    "the properties of scattered field and resulting absorption / scattering are typically studied using mode coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the origin of such effects come from the interference of the complementary electric and magnetic normal modes of the core - shell region .",
    "this requires a study of the higher order internal modes of the core - shell particle using all the above mentioned coefficients .",
    "we studied nanospheres with silica as dielectric core which is very stable in nature @xcite , and a shell of titania which is an unremarkable non - absorbing material in its vis properties , though strongly absorbing in the uv @xcite .",
    "we show that hollow titania nanoshells also exhibit similar behavior in the absence of the silica core .",
    "numerical results also suggest that these interference effects can survive size - dispersion in actual realization of materials while allowing spectral tunability based on the nominal geometrical parameters . in case of larger particles",
    "both resonances and transparencies manifest at different spectral regions of the particle and these are broad .",

    "we assume the titania is of anatase phase and the dispersive permittivity of anatase is different from its rutile phase @xcite ( see supplementary material for the refractive indices of the materials used ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the extinction spectra of silica - titania spheres of three increasing dimensions with varying ratios of thickness of shell and radius of the particle . as mentioned before",
    ", the larger shells exhibit non - intuitive spectra which we show later to be due to the interference between higher order modes .",
    "the 180 nm dia particles ( represented in figure 2a ) are unremarkable as they show a rayleigh scattering type @xmath26 behavior for @xmath27 450 nm as expected , followed by an indication of interference structure around the optical efficiency of 2 for 400 nm @xmath28 450 nm . the higher energies ( @xmath29 350 nm ) are strongly absorbed by titania and the extinction spectra show a saturation behavior based on thickness of the shells @xcite .",

    "this efficiency is 5 times smaller than that of the smaller 180 nm sphere of similar constitution , and note that while both titania and silica are in fact mostly non - absorbing in this energy spectrum , the lack of stronger scattering for the larger particles seems anomalous .",
    "weak absorption close to the absorption edge at 350 nm significantly enhances the typical interference structure in the extinction spectrum of a dielectric particle , resulting in this sharp asymmetric resonance around 370 nm . a similar more broadband effect for the larger sphere of 600 nm dia ( represented in figure 2c ) is observed , which exhibits both a broader transparency ( at @xmath31 @xmath30 450 nm ) and another resonance ( at @xmath31 @xmath30370 nm ) .",
