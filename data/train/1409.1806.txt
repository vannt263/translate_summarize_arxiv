    "the spontaneous creation of electron - positron pairs in a strong external electric field is a remarkable nonperturbative phenomenon , intrinsically associated with the instability of the quantum vacuum @xcite . in a constant electric field , this phenomenon  also known as the schwinger mechanism  has a production rate exponentially small @xmath0 .",
    "hence , its occurrence is expected to be difficult to achieve experimentally , unless the electric field strength @xmath1 comes close to the critical scale of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , a field of such a nature is not within the reach of current technical capabilities and a direct experimental observation of the schwinger mechanism remains a big challenge for the contemporary physics .",
    "hopes of reaching the required field strengths in the focal spot of envisaged high - intensity lasers such as the extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) @xcite and the exawatt center for extreme light studies ( xcels ) @xcite have renewed the interest in the study of schwinger - like pair production ( pp ) processes",
    ". its verification will provide significant insights in the nonlinear qed regime as well as in various processes which share its nonperturbative feature .",
    "notably , among them are the unruh and hawking radiation and the string breaking in the theory of the strong interactions @xcite .",
    "while the prospect of using the strong field of lasers is enticing from practical perspectives , there exists a price to be paid for : the complicated nature of the electromagnetic field of a laser pulse  the wave profile , its space - time dependence and the existence of magnetic field components  introduces considerable additional complications in the calculations associated with the pp process .",
    "indeed , it seems that a full description of the vacuum decay in such a scenario is far from being computationally feasible , at least in the near future . in order to make the problem tractable",
    "some simplifications are required . and",
    "@xmath3 vanish identically , and the vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude does not decay against electron - positron pairs  @xcite . ] in the first instance , an analysis in a pure electric field would be highly desirable since , on the one hand , it resembles the electric - like background used in the genuine schwinger mechanism , and on the other hand because this special field configuration can be obtained to a good approximation through a collision of two counterpropagating linearly polarized laser pulses with equal intensities and polarization directions .",
    "the resulting field is a standing electromagnetic wave depending separately upon the spatial and temporal coordinates .",
    "this setup substantially simplifies the treatment of the problem , but the field inhomogenity still represents a major task to overcome from analytic and numeric viewpoints . although some progresses in the latter direction have been accomplished already @xcite , most of the theoretical efforts carried out so far have been focused on the idealization in which the background is a homogeneous electric field oscillating in time @xcite . as such , this temporal dependence renders the vacuum decay into electron - positron pairs a far from equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "consequently , the quantum kinetic theory has turned out to be an appropriate formalism for analyzing the aforementioned process @xcite .    in parallel , various mechanisms for compensating the suppression associated with the spontaneous creation of electron - positron pairs from the vacuum have been put forward @xcite .",
    "some of them have been motivated by the fact that pair production by multiphoton absorption has been observed using nonlinear compton scattering @xcite . in line with this issue ,",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the pair creation rate can be enhanced by superimposing a weak beam of energetic photons with a strong but low - frequency electric field .",
    "the study of such a problem was carried out by taking the slow laser pulse as a constant electric field reducing the problem to that of a photon - stimulated schwinger pair creation .",
    "the idea has been further extended to the case in which both pulses are sauter fields with different time scales @xcite .",
    "however , in more realistic setups it is expected that the subcycle structure of an oscillating electric field ( oef ) plays a relevant role as it provides a phenomenology characterized by resonant effects and rabi - like oscillations @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the study of such a problem in a bifrequent oef composed of a strong and a weak mode has not been addressed so far .",
    "hence , we aim to show how these features are manifest in the dynamical - assisted schwinger mechanism and reveal their consequences in the total density of produced pairs . for other recent studies of pair production processes in bifrequent electromagnetic fields ,",
    "we refer the interested reader to refs .",

    "apart from this introductory portion , our paper has three additional sections . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qka ] we describe some basic features of the pp process within the framework of the quantum boltzmann - vlasov equation .",
    "afterwards , its solution in a periodic multimode oef is derived and a study of the resonant effects and rabi - like oscillations is carried out .",
    "the numerical results are exposed in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] for the particular situation in which a two - mode oef is considered . there",
    ", different issues associated with the production mechanism for various frequency combinations are discussed .",
    "special attention is paid to the effects caused by the superposition of a strong and perturbative mode on the single - particle distribution function .",
    "the density of pairs yielded in such a configuration is also investigated .",
    "further comments and remarks are finally given in the conclusion .",
    "we consider the production of electron - positron pairs from a vacuum polarized by an external classical electromagnetic field which is described by a spatially homogeneous but time - dependent four - potential @xmath4 . with the former assumption we are implicitly disregarding the potential realization of avalanche processes @xcite that could dim the field strength .",
    "the latter condition implies that the field can be fourier - expanded in terms of the canonical momentum @xmath5 and , additionally , prevents the existence of magnetic field components .",
    "note that , according to noether s theorem , the total momentum of each created pair will always sum up to zero .",
    "thus , the creation of an electron with momentum @xmath5 is always accompanied by the creation of a positron with momentum @xmath6 in the purely time - dependent external field .    for further convenience , we will choose @xmath4 fulfilling the temporal gauge ",
    ", @xmath7so that the nonvanishing electric field is given by @xmath8 pointing in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "hereafter , we focus ourselves in the subcritical regime @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron mass and charge , respectively . and the planck constant @xmath13 are equal to unity , @xmath14 . ] also , in what follows , we take into account neither the collision between the created particles nor their inherent radiation fields .",
    "previous investigations on these subjects have revealed that the effects induced by both phenomena are irrelevant for the pp whenever the field strength @xmath1 is weaker than the critical one @xmath15 @xcite and this is in fact the regime in which we are interested .",
    "we note that only those lorentz transformations which leave the external field invariant describe the formal invariance properties of the vacuum in the presence of the field .",
    "since they form a subgroup of the full lorentz symmetry group and the concept of one - particle states relies on the irreducible representations of the latter group @xcite , one finds that the standard classification of elementary particles is no longer applicable in the region occupied by an external field . despite this conceptual loss ,",
    "the canonical quantization of the matter sector of qed in an oef can be carried out @xcite .",
    "a relevant step in this direction results from the diagonalization of the corresponding hamiltonian in every instant of time through time - dependent bogolyubov transformations .",
    "such a procedure allows us to express the spinor field operator in terms of degrees of freedom in the external field , i. e. , in the so - called quasiparticles representation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the normalization volume and @xmath18 the discretized momentum with @xmath19 , @xmath20 in this framework , the time - dependent bispinors @xmath21 and @xmath22 are eigenfunctions of the boost operator component along the external field direction with eigenvalues @xmath23 .",
    "while @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the corresponding annihilation and creation operators for a quasiparticle , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the creation and annihilation operators for an antiquasiparticle , respectively .",

    "( [ anticommutator1 ] ) and ( [ anticommutator2 ] ) is mediated by certain bogolyubov coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 [ see details in appendix  [ subsec : gen - remarks ] ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the time evolution equations of @xmath38 follow from the temporal equations of @xmath36 .",
    "the latter can be determined by exploiting the fact that the field representations [ eq .",
    "( [ instantaneousfield ] ) ] satisfy the dirac equation in the external field .",
    "this procedure leads to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that have been extensively exploited in the study of several open questions associated with the ppprocess @xcite .",

    "( [ vlasov ] ) with a pronounced non - markovian feature @xcite .",
    "it means that the single - particle distribution function depends on the number of degrees of freedom already present in the system .",
    "we should also mention at this point that the experimentally observable fields are those resulting at asymptotically large times [ @xmath54 , when the electric field is switched off @xmath55 .",
    "these are the electron and positron one - particle states to which the degrees of freedom in an oefare relaxed at this asymptotic condition .",

    "than in the monofrequent case .",
    "one can observe , moreover , that the number of resonance rings with sizeable magnitudes is increased in the presence of a boef .",
    "this indicates that the total pair yield , which is obtained by integration over the momentum space , will be substantially larger in the boef .",
    "this becomes especially apparent in view of the considerably larger red - colored regions in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dim - mom](a ) .      from the two - dimensional momentum distributions in the @xmath154 plane ,",
    "we can obtain the total number of produced electron - positron pairs per unit volume by evaluating the integral .",
    "we can exploit the cylindrical symmetry of the problem about the @xmath9 axis and , accordingly , perform the integral over @xmath172 in cylindrical coordinates using @xmath173 as the polar coordinate . for a finite interaction time @xmath134",
    ", we thus arrive at the expression @xmath174 for the numerical evaluation , it is required to introduce a finite cutoff for such values in the momentum plane where the distribution function no longer contributes appreciably .",
    "we shall use the cutoff value @xmath175 and restrict the ranges of integration to @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "hence , we obtain approximately @xmath178 where we have exploited the symmetry relation @xmath179 in order to make the connection of the total number of produced pairs with the two - dimensional momentum distributions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dim - mom ] , explicit .",
    "the latter integral is solved by numerical integration as a sum of the corresponding discretized values provided by the two - dimensional data sets .",
    "first , we analyze the dependence of the total number of produced pairs on the strong - field intensity parameter of a boef .",
    "the latter has been varied within the interval @xmath180 .",
    "the other parameters were set to @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath130 and @xmath168 .",
    "the number of plateau cycles has been chosen to enable a good comparison with the moef case .",
    "for the boef according to table  i , the pair production probability will reach its next maximum close to @xmath168 , due to the periodic rabi oscillations . ]",
    "the latter was realized by using parameters identical to the strong mode of the boef .",
    "the respective plot for the total number of produced electron - positron pairs per unit volume ( given by the compton volume @xmath183 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : totn](a ) .",
    "we observe that throughout the whole range of @xmath184 values , the pair yield from the boef is substantially larger than that from the moef .",
    "this indicates an effective enhancement of the pair production by superimposing a second weak mode of high frequency in addition to a stronger one . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath185 , the boef results exceed the moef results by @xmath186 orders of magnitude . the ( average ) slope of the moef curve , however , is larger than the boef curve ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , so that eventually for @xmath187 the enhancing effect of the perturbative mode will diminish .",
    "this behavior coincides with the intuitive expectation according to which the perturbative high - frequency mode is getting less relevant because the low - frequency mode becomes strong enough to dominate the production process .",
    "another noticeable issue shown in fig .  [ fig : totn](a ) is the comparison for the moef case between the numerical results and the analytical curve obtained from ref .  @xcite .",
    "the general trend of both curves is very similar , with the caveat that their absolute heights are somewhat different ( see also fig .  14 in ref .",
    "a remarkable feature of the numerical curve is that it exhibits considerable dropoffs around the values of @xmath188 , 0.95 , and 1.32 , which do not occur for the analytical curve .",
    "they can be attributed to the fact that at these specific @xmath184 values a resonance disappears due to energetic reasons .",
    "namely , when @xmath184 increases , the effective mass @xmath189 increases as well , which determines the minimal energy to be absorbed from the field in order to produce a pair .",
    "this phenomenon is commonly known as a channel - closing effect ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the positions of the channel closings are marked by the vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : totn](a ) . from left",
    "to right , they correspond to the vanishing of the resonances with @xmath169 , 8 , and 9 , respectively .    ' '' ''     +    ' '' ''    finally , in addition to the previous discussion , fig .  [",
    "fig : totn](b ) shows the dependency of the total number of produced pairs per unit volume @xmath190 on the combined keldysh parameter given by @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the period of the perturbative mode . the interval @xmath193 is considered and the keldysh parameter is varied by varying @xmath105 while keeping @xmath194 fixed . the curve for @xmath157 , @xmath158 ( black solid line ) may serve us as a reference . by comparison",
    "we find that , when the intensity parameter of the weak mode is amplified by a factor of 1.5 ( blue solid line ) , a much stronger growth of the particle number results as compared with the case when the intensity parameter of the strong mode is increased by the same factor ( red dashed line ) .",
    "thus , in the considered interaction regime , it is more efficient to invest in an increase of the small parameter @xmath195 than a further increase of the large parameter @xmath184 .    moreover , a comparison of the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : totn](b ) reveals that the particle number scales linearly with @xmath195 . from our formalism , this can be understood by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) .",
    "the total electric field @xmath196 enters quadratically there , and since we operate in a regime where the combined effect of both modes is crucial , one may expect that the resulting cross term @xmath197 gives the largest contribution to the single - particle distribution function .",
    "this leads to a linear dependence on @xmath198 , in accordance with the numerical outcomes .",
    "we would like to stress that , despite its very plausible explanation , the linear scaling with the parameter @xmath195 is an interesting feature of pp in a boef .",
    "in fact , other pp processes , which exhibit a similar enhancement mechanism in a bifrequent field , do not share this scaling property . for dynamically assisted breit - wheeler  @xcite as well as bethe - heitler @xcite pp in strong laser fields , a quadratic scaling law",
    "@xmath199 has been found , provided that a single high - frequency photon assists in the process .",
    "this is because the underlying pp amplitude there is linear in @xmath195 whose square provides the pp rate . that a subquadratic dependence on @xmath195 arises in a boef",
    "can already be anticipated on the basis of its resonant nature , which does not exist for the pp processes in refs .",
    "the resonances provide a substantial contribution to the total number of produced pairs , but their height is bounded by the maximum value of @xmath200 .",
    "thus , an increase of @xmath195 can not enhance this value further .",
    "however , the fundamental reason for the different @xmath195 scaling in a boef as compared with intense bifrequent laser fields   @xcite can be traced back to the fact that the strong mode of the boef alone is capable of producing pairs , whereas the quantum vacuum is stable in the presence of a plane - wave laser field .",
    "therefore , in the latter case , the leading - order vacuum polarization diagram , whose imaginary part is related to the pp rate via the optical theorem , contains the perturbatively weak field at two vertices .",
    "in contrast , to the pp in an oef also diagrams with just a single perturbative vertex contribute , which leads to the observed linear dependence on the small parameter @xmath195 .",
    "we presented a comprehensive investigation of electron - positron pair production in a bifrequent oef composed of a strong low - frequency and a perturbative high - frequency mode .",
    "a quantum kinetic approach allowed us to calculate the single - particle distribution function by using numerical methods .",
    "we found a pronounced resonant behavior depending on the frequency composition of the field and demonstrated rabi - like oscillations in full time resolution on and slightly off a resonance peak ( secs .",
    "[ subsec : res - spec ]  and  [ subsec : rabi - like ] ) .",
    "these numerical findings showed a clear agreement with predictions from the theory [ sec .",
    "[ subsec : res - effects ] ] .",
    "the occurrence of the resonances could be explained by discrete numbers of photons absorbed from ( or emitted into ) the bifrequent field . while in the case of vanishing particle momenta , only odd total photon numbers are allowed due to charge - conjugation symmetry , resonant production of pairs with nonzero momenta",
    "may also proceed involving an even number ( secs .",
    "[ subsec:1d - mom ]  and  [ subsec:2d - mom ] ) .",
    "besides , it has been shown that processes with more than one photon from the perturbative mode also occur . finally , we have seen that the superimposed perturbative mode can substantially amplify the total number of generated electron - positron pairs in comparison with the case where a single strong mode drives the vacuum decay ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : total - numbers ] ) .",
    "the enhancement shows a linear dependence on the intensity parameter of the weak mode and is especially pronounced at large values of the relative keldysh parameter ( i.e. , at relatively low field strengths of the strong mode and high frequencies of the weak mode ) .",
