    "a major conceptual as well as technical difficulty in the practical implementation of quantum information processing and quantum control schemes is the unavoidable interaction of quantum systems with their environment .",
    "this interaction can destroy quantum superpositions and lead to an irreversible loss of information , a process generally known as decoherence .",
    "understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems is therefore of considerable importance .",
    "the schrdinger equation , which describes the evolution of closed systems , is generally inapplicable to open systems , unless one includes the environment in the description .",
    "this is , however , generally difficult , due to the large number of environment degrees of freedom .",
    "an alternative is to develop a description for the evolution of only the subsystem of interest .",
    "a multitude of different approaches have been developed in this direction , exact as well as approximate alicki:87,breuer : book .",
    "typically the exact approaches are of limited practical usefulness as they are either phenomenological or involve complicated integro - differential equations .",
    "the various approximations lead to regions of validity that have some overlap .",
    "such techniques have been studied for many different models , but their performance in general , is not fully understood .    in this work",
    "we consider an exactly solvable model of a single qubit ( spin @xmath0 particle ) coupled to an environment of qubits .",
    "we are motivated by the physical importance of such spin bath models @xcite in the description of decoherence in solid state quantum information processors , such as systems based on the nuclear spin of donors in semiconductors kane:98,vrijen:00 , or on the electron spin in quantum dots @xcite . rather than trying to accurately model decoherence due to the spin bath in such systems ( as in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , our goal in this work is to compare the performance of different master equations which have been proposed in the literature . because the model we consider is exactly solvable , we are able to accurately assess the performance of the approximation techniques that we study . in particular , we study the born - markov and born master equations , and the perturbation expansions of the nakajima - zwanzig ( nz ) @xcite and the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) master equations @xcite up to fourth order in the coupling constant .",
    "we also study the post - markovian ( pm ) master equation proposed in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system qubit in the model we study is highly non - markovian and hence we do not expect the traditional markovian master equations commonly used , e.g. , in quantum optics @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , to be accurate .",
    "this is typical of spin - baths , and was noted , e.g. , by breuer et al . @xcite .",
    "the work by breuer et al .",
    "( as well as by other authors in a number of subsequent publications palumbo:06,burgarth:06,hamdouni:06,yuan:07,camalet:07,jing:07 ) is conceptually close to ours in that in both cases an analytically solvable spin - bath model is considered and the analytical solution for the open system dynamics is compared to approximations . however , there are also important differences , namely , in ref .",
    "@xcite a so - called spin - star system was studied , where the system spin has equal couplings to all the bath spins , and these are of the xy exchange - type .",
    "in contrast , in our model the system spin interacts via ising couplings with the bath spins , and we allow for arbitrary coupling constants . as a result",
    "there are also important differences in the dynamics .",
    "for example , unlike the model in ref .",
    "bbp04 , for our model we find that the odd order terms in the perturbation expansions of nakajima - zwanzig and time - convolutionless master equations are non - vanishing .",
    "this reflects the fact that there is a coupling between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 components of the bloch vector which is absent in @xcite . in view of the non - markovian behavior of our model",
    ", we also discuss the relation between a representation of the analytical solution of our model in terms of completely positive maps , and the markovian limit obtained via a coarse - graining method introduced in @xcite , and the performance of the post - markovian master equation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we present the model , derive the exact solution and discuss its behavior in the limit of small times and large number of bath spins , and in the cases of discontinuous spectral density co - domain and alternating sign of the system - bath coupling constants . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider second order approximation methods such as the born - markov and born master equations , and a coarse - graining approach to the markovian semigroup master equation .",
    "then we derive solutions to higher order corrections obtained from the nakajima - zwanzig and time - convolutionless projection techniques as well as derive the optimal approximation achievable through the post - markovian master equation . in sec .",
    "iv , we compare these solutions for various parameter values in the model and plot the results . finally in sec .",
    "v , we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a single spin-@xmath3 system ( i.e. , a qubit with a two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 ) interacting with a bath of @xmath5 spin-@xmath3 particles ( described by an @xmath5-fold tensor product of two - dimensional hilbert spaces denoted @xmath6 ) .",
    "we model the interaction between the system qubit and the bath by the ising hamiltonian @xmath7where @xmath8 are dimensionless real - valued coupling constants in the interval @xmath9 $ ] , and @xmath10 is a parameter having the dimension of frequency ( we work in units in which @xmath11 ) , which describes the coupling strength and will be used below in conjunction with time ( @xmath12 ) for perturbation expansions .",

    "so we do not lose generality , since we will be working in the interaction picture where only the frequencies @xmath17 appear in relation to the state of the bath [ eq .  ( [ eq : rhob0 ] ) ] . since the ratios of these frequencies and the temperature of the bath occur in the equations , only their values relative to the temperature are of interest .",
    "therefore , henceforth we will omit the units of frequency and temperature and will treat these quantities as dimensionless .",
    "the interaction picture is defined as the transformation of any operator @xmath18where @xmath19 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath20 chosen here is invariant under this transformation since it commutes with @xmath21 .",
    "[ note that in the next subsection , to simplify our calculations we redefine @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( whence @xmath23 becomes @xmath20 ) , but this does not alter the present analysis . ]",
    "all the quantities discussed in the rest of this article are assumed to be in the interaction picture .",
    "the dynamics can be described using the superoperator notation for the liouville operator @xmath24,\\]]where @xmath25 is the density matrix for the total system in the hilbert space @xmath26 .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the von neumann equation @xmath27and the formal solution of this equation can be written as follows : @xmath28the state of the system is given by the reduced density operator @xmath29where @xmath30 denotes a partial trace taken over the bath hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "this can also be written in terms of the bloch sphere vector @xmath31where @xmath32 is the vector of pauli matrices .",

    "now , we derive the exact solution for the reduced density operator @xmath47 corresponding to the system . we do this in two different ways .",
    "the kraus operator sum representation is a standard description of the dynamics of a system initially decoupled from its environment and it will also be helpful in studying the coarse - graining approach to the quantum semigroup master equation .",
    "the second method is computationally more effective and is helpful in obtaining analytical expressions for @xmath48 .      in the kraus representation",
    "the system state at any given time can be written as @xmath49where the kraus operators satisfy @xmath50 kraus:83 .",
    "these operators can be expressed easily in the eigenbasis of the initial state of the bath density operator as @xmath51where the bath density operator at the initial time is @xmath52 . for the gibbs thermal state chosen here ,",

    "here @xmath55is the energy of each eigenstate @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the binary expansion of the integer @xmath58 , and the partition function is @xmath59 .",

    "( [ prod ] ) is @xmath98where we have used eq .",

    "does not decay exponentially but is initially flat , as is the case here due to the vanishing time derivative of @xmath101 at @xmath102 . as we will see in sec .",
    "iii , the dynamics in the born approximation ( which is also the second order time - convolutionless approximation ) exactly matches the last result .      when @xmath48 and the values of @xmath8 are random , then the different terms in the product of eq .",
    "( [ prod ] ) are smaller than @xmath103 most of the time and have recurrences at different times .",
    "therefore , we expect the function @xmath97 to be close to zero in magnitude for most of the time and full recurrences , if they exist , to be extremely rare . when @xmath8 are equal and so are @xmath16 , then partial recurrences occur periodically , independently of @xmath5 .",
    "full recurrences occur with a period which grows at least as fast as @xmath5 .",
    "this can be argued from eq .",
    "( [ exactsoln ] ) by imposing the condition that the arguments of all the cosines and sines are simultaneously equal to an integer multiple of @xmath104 .",
    "when @xmath105 has a narrow high peak , e.g. , one @xmath8 is much larger than the others , then the corresponding terms in the products in eq .",
    "( [ prod ] ) oscillate faster than the rate at which the whole product decays .",
    "this is effectively a modulation of the decay .      as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ prod ] ) , the coupling constants @xmath8 determine the oscillation periods of the product terms , while the temperature factors @xmath106 determine their modulation depths .",
    "if the codomain of spectral density is not continuous , i.e. it can be split into nonoverlapping intervals @xmath107 , @xmath108 , then eq .  ( [ prod ] ) can be represented in the following form : @xmath109where @xmath110.\\]]in this case , if @xmath107 are separated by large enough gaps , the evolution rates of different @xmath111 can be significantly different .",
    "this is particularly noticeable if one @xmath111 undergoes partial recurrences while another @xmath112 slowly decays .",
    "for example , one can envision a situation with two intervals such that one term shows frequent partial recurrences that slowly decay with time , while the other term decays faster , but at times larger than the recurrence time .",
    "the overall evolution then consists in a small number of fast partial recurrences . in an extreme case , when one @xmath8 is much larger then the others , this results in an infinite harmonic modulation of the decay with depth dependent on @xmath106 , i.e. , on temperature .",
    "if the bath has the property that every bath qubit @xmath113 has a pair @xmath114 with the same frequency @xmath115 , but opposite coupling constant @xmath116 , the exact solution can be simplified .",
    "first , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",

    "( [ eq : cs ] ) becomes @xmath120 , so that @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the exact solution is then symmetric under the interchange @xmath123 , a property shared by all the second order approximate solutions considered below , as well as the post - markovian master equation .",
    "the limiting case eq .",
    "( [ eq : f - approx ] ) remains unchanged , and since @xmath124 depends on @xmath125 , but not @xmath8 , it and all second order approximations also remain unchanged . in the special case @xmath126 ,",
    "the exact solution exhibits full recurrences with period @xmath127 .",
    "in this section we discuss the performance of different approximation methods developed in the open quantum systems literature alicki:87,breuer : book .",
    "the corresponding master equations for the system density matrix can be derived explicitly and since the model considered here is exactly solvable , we can compare the appoximations to the exact dynamics .",
    "we use the bloch vector representation and since the @xmath66 component has no dynamics , a fact which is reflected in all the master equations , we omit it from our comparisons .      both the born and born - markov approximations are second order in the coupling strength @xmath128 .",
    "the born approximation is equivalent to a truncation of the nakajima - zwanzig projection operator method at the second order , which is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "iii b. the born approximation is given by the following integro - differential master equation:@xmath129\\}\\text{d}s.\\]]since in our case the interaction hamiltonian is time - independent , the integral becomes easy to solve .",

    "this gives @xmath137which can be readily solved by taking the inverse laplace transform .",
    "doing so , we obtain the solution of the born master equation for our model : @xmath138note that this solution is symmetric under the interchange @xmath123 , but the exact dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ exactsoln ] ) does not have this symmetry .",
    "the exact dynamics respects the symmetry : @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which is a symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "this means that higher order corrections are required to break the symmetry @xmath123 in order to approximate the exact solution more closely .",
    "one often makes the substitution @xmath136 for @xmath141 in eq .",
    "( bornapprox ) since the integro - differential equation obtained in other models may not be as easily solvable .",
    "this approximation , which is valid for short times , yields @xmath142which gives @xmath143i.e . , we recover eq .",
    "( [ shorttimes ] ) .",
    "this is the same solution obtained in the second order approximation using the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) projection method discussed in sec .",
    "iii b.      in order to obtain the born - markov approximation , we use the following quantities @xcite[ch.3 ] : @xmath144where @xmath145 , @xmath146 is an eigenvalue of the system hamiltonian @xmath22 , and @xmath147 is the projector onto the eigenspace corresponding to this eigenvalue . in our case",
    "@xmath22 is diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath33 , and only @xmath148 is relevant .",
    "this leads to @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "since @xmath151 is real , we have @xmath152 hence the lamb shift hamiltonian @xmath153 , and the lindblad form of the born - markov approximation is @xmath154where @xmath155d@xmath156 . but note that @xmath157 does not depend on time .",
    "this means that @xmath158 and hence @xmath159 are both infinite . thus the born - markov approximation is not valid for this model and the main reason for this is the time independence of the bath correlation functions .",
    "the dynamics is inherently non - markovian .",
    "a different approach to the derivation of a markovian semigroup master equation was proposed in @xcite . in this approach ,",
