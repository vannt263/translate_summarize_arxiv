    "the categorization of the electroweak ( ew ) corrections based on their contribution types dates back to a study of photon propagated four - fermion processes @xcite .",
    "the corrections to vertices , box diagrams and bremsstrahlung diagrams were all considered as `` direct '' whereas the propagator corrections due to vacuum polarization effects were all named as `` oblique '' since these participate to the computations in an indirect manner @xcite .",
    "the ew precision data collected over the last few decades by various particle physics experiments have often been used to constrain many new models of particle interactions .",
    "they are particularly useful in checking the allowed parameter space of a given model through its contributions especially to the vacuum polarization corrections to the boson propagators .",
    "the main oblique parameters are usually denoted by letters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the auxiliaries with letters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite . as an example , the @xmath2 parameter estimates the size of the new fermion sector and the @xmath3 parameter measures the isospin symmetry violation , i.e. the split between the masses of the new up and down - type fermions .",
    "the standard model is defined by the values @xmath8 for a given top quark and higgs boson mass .",
    "together with the detailed review by peskin and takeuchi @xcite , a number of papers were published , calculating the contribution of a given model to the oblique parameters . to name a few , the estimation of the number of fermion families and neutral gauge bosons @xcite",
    ", the validity consideration of the higgs - less models @xcite , and the investigation of the majorana nature of the neutrinos @xcite can be cited .",
    "however , a number of such publications suffer from unusual notations with typos in formulas , and errors arising due to utilization of approximations instead of exact calculations ( with assumptions such as @xmath9 ) or in some cases from unguarded remarks such as `` heavy '' for the new fermions .",
    "the goal of this work is two fold : the first is to present a library to compute the oblique parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 both with exact one - loop calculations and with some well - defined approximations for a number of models and the second is to scan the available parameter space for the fourth family models .",
    "the comparisons between exact and approximate computations , and amongst formulas from different papers provide an error checking machinery which improves the enduser reliability .",
    "implemented in c / c++ languages , we call this library opucem , which stands for oblique parameters using c with error - checking machinery .",
    "the opucem package consisting of the library and a set of example driver and presentation functions , which are discussed in this manuscript , are publicly available @xcite .",
    "the next section describes the technical details of the library implementation .",
    "then the following sections are on detailed physics studies demonstrating the use cases of opucem .",
    "section 3 uses the opucem library to investigate the plausibiliy of a generic fourth standard model ( sm ) family ( sm4 ) .",
    "section 4 focuses on the implications of the ew data from the viewpoint of the flavor democracy ( fd ) hypothesis , which provides a principle theoretical motivation for the potential existence of a fourth sm family .",
    "these case studies deal with defining the parameter regions favored by the data and define a set of benchmarking points for the sm4 . in both sections ,",
    "dirac and majorana cases of the fourth sm family neutrino are investigated separately . finally in section 5 ,",
    "we present our concluding remarks .",
    "the opucem library mainly consists of a header file ` opucem.h ` declaring the available function prototypes and ` opucem.c ` implementing them .",
    "the functions are grouped by the relevant physics cases such as majorana neutrinos or higgs bosons . in each case , internal comments are used to document the source code , indicating the reference paper for each of the formula and the nature of the calculations ( e.g. exact 1-loop calculations , or approximations valid under certain assumptions such as the new fermions being much heavier than the z - boson ) .",
    "compilation of the library is straightforward , however a makefile is provided as is customary .",
    "the makefile also features additional targets to produce example command - line and graphical - user - interface applications that make use of the library in studying the fermions of a fourth sm family @xcite .",
    "one of the primary goals of the implementation is portability , since we consider portability an auxiliary measure of the reliability of the code . to facilitate this goal ,",
    "the initial implementation was done in pure c , with the code having no dependencies or requirements beyond a standards - compliant c compiler . since certain formulas make use of complex numbers , we made use of the complex type found in the c99 standard .",
    "however , starting with version 00 - 00 - 03 , the c99 complex type was dropped in favor of the std::complex template in the c++ standard template library .",
    "the main motivation for this change was to provide an easy roadmap for an eventual replacement of various long double variables with multi - precision variables .",
    "the compilation and execution is compatible with any unix - like environment with modern versions of the gnu compiler collection ( gcc ) @xcite , that support a subset of the complex functions given in the c99 standard .",
    "for example , the last version which uses the pure c implementation ( v00 - 00 - 02 ) is known to compile with gcc 4.x . on the other hand , the current version ( v00 - 00 - 04 ) , which makes use of the c++ std::complex templates ,",
    "can only be compiled with versions of g++ 4.2 onwards , which implements the part of the c++ technical report 1 ( tr1 ) that pertains to complex numbers .",
    "tr1 introduced the complex inverse hyperbolic functions of c99 into the std::complex template , and these additions are expected to appear in the upcoming c++0x standard as well .",
    "while we do not intend to support microsoft windows operating system as a regular opucem target , we still have ported the c version of the library using the gnu development toolchain provided under the cygwin environment and independently by the native tools from the mingw project @xcite .",
    "the main missing ingredients are complex numbers with long double precision .",
    "the latest mingw distribution ( mingw 5.1.6 ) comes with complex.h implementations for gcc 3.4.4 and gcc 4.3.4 but only with double precision . for this reason , for the windows port",
    ", we rely on an external implementation of the c99 complex numbers implemented by s.@xmath10moshier @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this complex - number implementation , along with the long double math library from the same author , makes it possible to port the c version of opucem to any architecture that supports even rather old versions of the gnu compiler collection .",
    "( for example under cygwin 1.5.25 , we were able to compile even with gcc 3.4.4 . ) under a separate windows branch , we provide documentation and makefiles to facilitate such efforts .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that the current version of the code , while using the c++ complex templates , is still structured in a strictly c - like manner , making no use of the object - oriented features of c++ . because of this , it is clear that the enduser experience is likely to quickly deteriorate as more and more physics models are added to the library in the future .",
    "therefore for the upcoming revisions of the code , the planned updates include a better c++ implementation , in particular making use of namespaces to separate formulas from different physics models .",
    "the oblique parameter calculation is implemented for the following scenarios in the current version of the opucem library :    * new lepton doublets with dirac @xcite or majorana @xcite type neutral leptons ; * new quark doublets with variable @xmath11 ckm mixing to the third generation @xcite ; * sm and 2 higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "additionally , a set of functions for recalculation of the sm origin in the @xmath12 plane based on reference values of the top quark and the higgs boson masses is also available .    during the implementation of the library ,",
    "a number of minor errors on the reference papers have been found and corrected .",
    "these are :    * mixing angle in the definition of the left - handed weak eigenstates of the two majorana neutrinos in @xcite ; their equation 10 should read @xmath13 .",
    "* contribution to w and z boson self energies induced by the two majorana neutrinos in @xcite ; the right hand side of their equation 3.6 should start as @xmath14 ( see the corrected form in@xmath10@xcite ) .",
    "to ensure the correct calculation of the oblique parameters , a number of validation techniques have been used .",
    "the core part of the library has been pair programmed , with subsequent updates consistently cross - checked against the earlier parts .",
    "furthermore , a number of sanity checks have been performed during the implementation .",
    "some of these checks are documented as embedded comments in the source code .",
    "for example , by setting the masses of the second doublet higgs particles in the 2-higgs - doublet - model to zero and taking into account the extra multiplicative factor of 3 , we have verified the calculation of the contribution from the sm higgs boson .",
    "other sanity checks have been promoted to become actual run - time tests , accessible through clearly indicated safe - to - use functions .",
    "for example , the contributions to @xmath2 and @xmath4 parameters from majorana - type neutrinos requires high precision , for which the long double type might not be adequate under certain values of the input parameters . to catch such cases automatically , we check whether the computations for majorana - type neutrinos converge to those of the dirac - type in the fully - degenerate limit of the two majorana masses .",
    "moreover , these safe - to - use functions compare approximate and exact computations and display warnings if absolute or relative difference between the two are above certain predefined thresholds .",
    "finally , special cases such as equal mass values for up and down type fermions , have been addressed carefully with limiting cases of the formulas derived using symbolic computation tools .    ,",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 , with masses @xmath17 gev , @xmath18@xmath19gev and @xmath20@xmath19gev as a function of @xmath21 the top plot is from @xcite and the bottom plot is the output of opucem library . in both cases exact and approximate calculations",
    "are compared.[fig : kniehl_kohrs ] ]    , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with masses @xmath17 gev , @xmath18@xmath19gev and @xmath20@xmath19gev as a function of @xmath21 the top plot is from @xcite and the bottom plot is the output of opucem library . in both cases exact and approximate calculations are compared.[fig : kniehl_kohrs ] ]    we have also tried to make sure that the opucem implementation of the formulas can correctly reproduce the tables and plots in the previously published work .",
    "an example of this has been available in the ` examples / prd48_pg225 ` directory since the very first public version of the library .",
    "the provided shell script generates an executable that calculates @xmath2 and @xmath4 as a function of the lepton mass parameter @xmath22 , reproducing the first figure of @xcite , as shown in figure@xmath10[fig : kniehl_kohrs ] .",
    "it is worth noting that some of the comparisons mentioned in the previous section can not go beyond being qualitative analyses , due to the fact that quantitative information is missing in the original publications . in such cases ,",
    "we have tried to manually extract values from the published figures and documented the level of agreement as auxiliary notes spread as comments in the source code . in a few cases",
    ", we have also discovered that the representation of data in the figures was incorrect .",
    "an example of such a mistake is in the figure 2 of @xcite , where the @xmath23 fit results to the ew precision data are being plotted on the @xmath12 plane . in that figure ,",
    "the 90% confidence level ( cl ) ellipse seems to have been plotted instead of the 2-sigma ( 95% cl ) error ellipse . in our figure",
    "[ fig : kribs - corrected - figure ] , we show both the 90% cl and 95% cl error ellipses to highlight the enlarged parameter space . in the same paper , we have also identified additional minor errors in the value of the @xmath3 parameter for @xmath24=300 gev and in the position of the @xmath12 origin , after their recomputation to take into account new reference values of the the top quark and presumed higgs boson masses .",
    "although the relative size of all these errors are rather small ( ~3 - 4% ) , and the impact on the conclusions of the paper is negligible , we mention them here for the sake of accuracy .    in order to facilitate correct representation of the ew data on the @xmath12 plane , we provide our plotting routines as part of the opucem package , under the ` tools / stellipse ` directory .",
    "error ellipses can easily be drawn from the central values and the uncertainties of the measured @xmath25 values and their correlation coefficient .",
    "these plotting functions make use of the root package @xcite , an object - oriented c++ analysis framework from cern and the de facto standard for statistical analysis in the experimental high - energy physics community today .    ]      besides the full - featured standard command - line , the package also provides users with a light - weight graphical user interface ( gui ) for demonstration purposes .",
    "the gui developed within the root @xcite framework , is actually an independent application loading the opucem libraries at run - time .",
    "it makes relevant function calls based on the user set of inputs and simply displays the results accordingly on the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane .",
    "as it can be seen on the figure [ flo : gui ] , the gui provides simple input boxes for the input parameters such as the fermion masses and also access to the internal parameters used in the calculations such as the sine squared of the weak mixing angle .",
    "the user can perform the @xmath2-@xmath3 calculation , see the resulting data points being plotted and save the plot in multiple formats ( e.g. eps , png , root , etc . ) using the buttons at the bottom of the gui window .",
    "for example , majority of the @xmath2-@xmath3 plots shown in this manuscript have been generated using the opucem gui .",
    "like the library itself , the opucem gui has been tested on various operating systems ( os ) running different root releases .",
    "these include but are not limited to slc-5 , mac osx 10.5 and 10.6 running rootv5.26.00(b ) , ubuntu-9.10 and 10.4 running rootv5.18.00b .",
    "however it should be noted that while the gui can both be interpreted in root and be natively compiled , the library functions themselves are always loaded dynamically in binary form at run time .        we have chosen the root framework for visualization and gui development as an example , however we do not necesarily endorse any specific framework . since opucem is a generic function library ,",
    "it can be loaded and instantly be used from within any rapid application development ( rad ) environment such as mono@xcite and gambas@xcite for basic , qtcreator@xcite for c / c++ , and potentially ms visual studio for .net pretty much the same way .",
    "this makes possible applications of the opucem library available on almost any platform .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we make use of opucem to study the standard model with 4 generations of fermions ( sm4 ) in order to determine the parameter space compatible with the precision ew data and to look for possible correlations among the sm4 parameters .",
    "a fourth sm family , with fermion doublets of masses heavier than 100@xmath19gev , could explain some emerging new physics hints from current particle physics experiments and also cure some of the theoretical shortcomings of the sm itself @xcite .",
    "the compatibility of the additional generations with the electroweak data was previously investigated using a multi - parameter fit approach@xmath10@xcite .      before using opucem to scan the fourth generation parameter space ,",
    "we would like to point to the excellent applicability of the @xmath25 formalism in studies of sm4 , by providing an example comparing the results from a global ew fit ( involving 16 input parameters and more than 10 degrees of freedom ) to those obtained from the oblique parameters .",
    "in a recent publication , it has been demonstated that the mixing between the third and the fourth generation quarks , @xmath26 , plays an important role in the determination of the best fit to the ew precision data@xmath10@xcite .",
    "a resulting plot from this publication is reproduced in figure [ fig : h_vs_sinth34-a ] , in which the most probable value of the higgs boson mass obtained from the global fit is plotted as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "opucem library is able to closely reproduce this result without a global fit by scanning the @xmath24-@xmath27 parameter space , as shown in figure [ fig : h_vs_sinth34-b ] .",
    "the different colors correspond to different @xmath28-probability values .",
    "there is a very good agreement between the most possible values obtained from opucem and the trend of the global fit results from @xcite .      neglecting possible mixings in the fermionic sector as motivated by the preference for small @xmath27 , one deals with 5 parameters ( masses of the four new fermions , @xmath29 , and of the higgs boson ) if the neutrino is of dirac type like the other fermions .",
    "however in the realm of the sm , there is no reason to forbid the majorana mass terms for right - handed components of neutrinos . in this case",
    ", the neutrino transforms into two majorana particles .",
    "we will denote the lighter of these as @xmath30 and the heavier as @xmath31 .",
    "thus in the majorana case , one has an extra mass parameter ( @xmath32 ) to consider . given the many degrees of freedom , we initially follow a simple scanning method : namely , we choose definite value(s ) for dirac(majorana ) neutrino mass(es ) and scan the masses of the three charged fermions and the higgs boson .",
    "we note that similar scans with more details have very recently appeared in the literature , but only for dirac - type neutrinos@xmath10@xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\"],title=\"fig : \" ]    we start by an analysis of the quark sector .",
    "the results are presented in figure@xmath10[fig : genel - quarks ] for dirac ( left ) and majorana ( right ) cases .",
    "the mass values , for which the computed _ s _ and _ t _ fall within the 2@xmath33 error ellipse of the lep ew working group s @xmath23 fit@xmath10@xcite , are accepted .",
    "darker regions correspond to more entries , whereas the white region has no entries .",
    "we scan the charged fermion masses from 200@xmath19gev to 1@xmath19tev and higgs mass from 115@xmath19gev to 900@xmath19gev . in the dirac neutrino case ,",
    "the neutrino mass is assumed to be , m@xmath34= 90@xmath19gev , the lowest value allowed by the lep data@xmath10@xcite .",
    "it is seen that the preferable values for @xmath35-@xmath36 mass difference lie between -30@xmath19gev and + 40@xmath19gev , independent of the quark mass .",
    "however , values between -70@xmath19gev and + 80@xmath19gev are also allowed .",
    "studying other neutrino mass values , we observe that these results show a slight dependence on the fourth neutrino dirac mass . in the majorana neutrino case , we initially assume @xmath37@xmath19gev , the lowest value allowed by the lep data@xmath10@xcite and @xmath38@xmath19gev . it is seen that although the preferable values for @xmath35-@xmath36 mass difference lie around 100@xmath19gev , other values between -110@xmath19gev and + 130@xmath19gev are also allowed .",
    "if the lighter neutrino mass increases , the favoured @xmath35- @xmath36 mass difference also increases , as an example for @xmath39@xmath19gev , the preferred @xmath35- @xmath36 mass difference lies around 170@xmath19gev .    , title=\"fig:\"],title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure@xmath10[fig : genel - lepton ] , the correlation between the fourth family lepton mass and quark mass differences are shown for dirac ( left ) and majorana ( right ) neutrinos . in this figure ,",
    "where the darker ( lighter ) regions correspond to more ( less ) entries , only the mass values falling into the 2@xmath33 error ellipse of _ s _ and _ t _ parameters are shown . the charged fermion masses from 200@xmath19gev to 1000@xmath19gev and higgs mass from 115@xmath19gev to 900@xmath19gev have been scanned .",
    "neutrino masses are selected as in figure@xmath10[fig : genel - quarks ] .",
    "it is seen that only @xmath40 masses below 275 ( 390)@xmath19gev are allowed for dirac ( majorana ) cases for a @xmath35-@xmath36 mass difference that lie between -80@xmath19gev and + 90@xmath19gev , independent of the quark mass .",
    "the impact of the higgs mass is better understood with a reduced set of parameters . to that end , and based on the hint from the mass difference studies , the correlation of the mass difference between the quark sector and the lepton sector is studied for different values of the higgs boson mass . however , in this study , the fermion masses themselves are not used as independent variables ; while keeping the sum of the quark and lepton masses as equal and constant , the probabilities are calculated as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath42 mass difference . the upper part of figure@xmath10[fig : dirac - sums ] shows the @xmath43 probability of fourth generation s compatibility with the ew precision data for @xmath44@xmath19gev but for different values of the fermion mass sums : from left to right @xmath45 600 , 1000 and 1600@xmath19gev .",
    "different colors correspond to different probabilities with black being the highest and blue the lowest as given in the scale on the right hand side .",
    "the most probable mass differences constitute an ellipse in the @xmath46,@xmath47 plane , independent of the fermion mass sums .",
    "the ellipse obtained from the fit to the 1600@xmath19gev results , can be seen on all 3 plots in yellow solid line .",
    "the impact of the higgs boson mass is shown in the lower 3 plots , where the fermion mass sum is taken as 1600@xmath19gev but the higgs boson mass changes as 115 , 300 and 600@xmath19gev , from left to right .",
    "one can notice that as the higgs boson mass increases , so do the fitted ellipse s radii .    ]    ]    the results of the fitted ellipse s semi - minor axis length as a function of @xmath48 are given in figure@xmath10[fig : fit_sum ] , the upper plot .",
    "the lower plot shows that the semi - major axis is always 1.75 times longer than its semi - minor axis .",
    "it is therefore possible to summarize the results and parameterize the core of the valid region as a function of the higgs mass ( all masses in gev ) :",
    "@xmath49    ]    for majorana - type neutrinos , the compatibility of the fourth generation with ew data depends also on the heavier majorana neutrino s mass .",
    "this dependency can be illustrated using three example scenarios with different higgs boson mass values , shown with open circles in figure@xmath10[fig : higgs_impact_majorana ] .",
    "the open circle inside the 1-sigma ellipse corresponds to @xmath50115@xmath19gev and @xmath51=@xmath52=300@xmath19gev , @xmath53=245@xmath19gev and @xmath54=355@xmath19gev .",
    "the open circle inside the 2-sigma ellipse corresponds to a higher higgs boson mass , of 450 gev and to fermion masses as @xmath51=335@xmath19gev , @xmath52=@xmath53=265@xmath19gev and @xmath54=335@xmath19gev . the third open circle , the farthest from the center of the @xmath2-@xmath3 minimum is for the heaviest higgs mass : 900@xmath19gev with the corresponding fermion masses as @xmath51=@xmath54=435@xmath19gev , @xmath53=365@xmath19gev and @xmath52=455@xmath19gev . for all the three open circles the mass of the heavier neutrino , @xmath55 , was initially taken to be the same as its lighter partner .",
    "keeping their equivalent dirac mass constant , ( @xmath56 = const . ) , their ratio ( @xmath57 ) was increased from 1 to higher values in steps of 0.5 alongside the solid line connecting the closed circles .",
    "the highest value of the ratio is fixed by the lowest experimentally allowed @xmath58 mass of 80@xmath19gev .",
    "the plot shows that the increase of the ratio causes an initial decrease in @xmath3 which later becomes an increase .",
    "this behaviour is accompanied by a continuous slight decrease in @xmath2 . the combination of these two has the potential of driving the test points into the allowed region , even for the @xmath24=900@xmath19gev case , the farthest from the @xmath2-@xmath3 minimum .",
    "it can be concluded that the asymmetry between the two majorana neutrino masses provides an opportunity for accommodating very heavy higgs bosons in the fourth family model .",
    "while the allowed parameter space for the dirac case has recently been considered narrow@xcite , it is clear that allowing neutrinos to be of majorana - type significantly extends the range of possibilities .",

    "mass and mixing patterns of the first three family fermions are provided by small deviations from the full flavor democracy .",
    "it should be noted that fd consequences are independent on concrete mechanism of fermion s mass generation ( e.g. higgs mechanism ) , the sole requirement is that this mechanism should be the same for all sm fermions .    if the common yukawa constant of the fermion - higgs interactions is taken to be equal to su@xmath62(2 ) coupling constant g@xmath62 , the fourth family fermion masses are equal to @xmath63 ( where @xmath64@xmath65245 gev ) , therefore , @xmath66 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the fourth family masses are restricted from above ( @xmath67 tev ) due to partial wave unitarity .",

    "we have presented opucem , an open - source function library publicly available to calculate the electroweak oblique parameters @xmath104 @xmath3 and @xmath4 for a number of physics models . this library has been heavily tested and shown to be able reproduce various earlier results successfully .",
    "it provides safe - to - use functions with an error - checking machinery that relies on comparisons amongst different formulas and between exact calculations and well - known approximations .",
    "the current version is expected to compile , run and give correct results using any unix - like platform with the c++ technical report 1 ( tr1 ) compiler support ( e.g. g++ 4.2 or later ) .",

    "many scientific papers include numerical examples of various symbolic calculations . with time , such examples loose a lot of their value , unless they are not readily reproducible by others .",
    "reproduction of old results is usually very difficult , since most representations of the numerical results are on plots and figures , which provide only limited precision when one wants to check an independent re - implementation of the symbolic calculations . as a solution to this",
    ", we suggest authors of scientific papers , which present and demonstrate new formulas , commit the actual computer code of their numerical calculations on a publicly available repository .",
    "this will also help resolve errors that occasionally happen when the results are sent to publication , such as misprinting of the formulas .",
    "in addition to the library itself , we have also presented an example of its use in studying the mass parameters of a fourth generation of standard model fermions .",
    "investigations yielded regions of the parameter space favored by the precision ew data , both for dirac and majorana cases of the fourth sm family neutrinos . for the dirac - type neutrinos , the allowed mass parameters describe an elliptical ring in the @xmath105 , @xmath106 plane when the sum of the fourth generation quark masses and the sum of the fourth generation lepton masses are kept constant . the radius and the thickness of this elliptical ring are dependent on the mass of the higgs boson and the mixing angle between the third and fourth generation quarks .",
    "we also note that on this ring , ew data favours @xmath99 and @xmath107 . for the majorana case ,",
    "the additional parameter ( the mass of the heavier neutrino ) gives more flexibility to the choice of parameters and especially by adjusting the ratio of the masses of the new neutrinos ,",
    "it is possible to move some additional portions of the parameter space to become compatible with the measured @xmath25 values . finally , we test predictions of the flavor democracy hypothesis and find that in either majorana or dirac case , for the fd predictions to be true , the sine of the mixing angle should be about 0.02 , @xmath51 should be about 50 - 60 gev higher than the generic 4th generation mass scale and the smaller values of the higgs mass are preferred . under these conditions , the @xmath28 measured on the @xmath25 plane for an fd - motivated 4-generation sm is lower than the 3-generation sm .",
