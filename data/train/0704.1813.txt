    "recent discoveries of several extremely low mass white dwarfs ( wds ) in the field ( kilic et al . 2007 ; eisenstein et al . 2006 ; kawka et al .",

    "no galaxy is old enough to produce such extremely low mass wds through single star evolution .",
    "the oldest globular clusters in our galaxy are currently producing @xmath5@xmath1  wds ( hansen et al .",
    "2007 ) , therefore lower mass wds must experience significant mass loss . the most likely explanation is a close binary companion .",
    "if a wd forms in a close binary , it can lose its outer envelope without reaching the asymptotic giant branch and without ever igniting helium , ending up as a low mass , helium core wd .",
    "confirmation of the binary nature of several low mass wds by marsh et al .",
    "( 1995 ) supports this binary formation scenario .",
    "white dwarf binaries provide an important tool for testing binary evolution , specifically the efficiency of the mass loss process and the common envelope phase .",
    "since wds can be created only at the cores of giant stars , their properties can be used to reconstruct the properties of the progenitor binary systems . using a simple core mass - radius relation for giants and the known orbital period ,",
    "the initial orbital parameters of the binary system can be determined . for a review of binary evolution involving wds ,",

    "late type stellar companions to low mass wds have a distribution of masses with median 0.27@xmath1  ( nelemans & tout 2005 ) .",

    "do extremely low mass wds form in binaries with neutron stars , wds , or late type stars ? if the companion is a neutron star , the mass of the neutron star can be used to constrain the neutron star equation of state . in case of a wd or a late type star companion , the orbital parameters can be used to constrain the common - envelope phase of binary evolution in these systems . in this letter , we present new optical spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements for j0917 + 46 .",
    "our observations are discussed in  2 , while an analysis of the spectroscopic data and the discovery of a companion are discussed in  3 .",
    "the nature of the companion is discussed in  4 .",
    "we used the 6.5 m mmt telescope equipped with the blue channel spectrograph to obtain moderate resolution spectroscopy of sdss j0917 + 46 nine times over the course of five nights between ut 2006 december 22 - 27 and five times on ut 2007 march 19 .",
    "the spectrograph was operated with the 832 line mm@xmath3 grating in second order , providing a wavelength coverage of 3650 - 4500  .",
    "most spectra were obtained with a 1.0@xmath8 slit yielding a resolving power of @xmath9 4300 , however a 1.25@xmath8 slit was used on 2006 december 24 , which resulted in a resolving power of 3500 .",
    "exposure times ranged from 15 to 22 minutes and yielded signal - to - noise ratio @xmath10 in the continuum at 4000  .",
    "all spectra were obtained at the parallactic angle , and comparison lamp exposures were obtained after every exposure .",
    "the spectra were flux - calibrated using blue spectrophotometric standards ( massey et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "heliocentric radial velocities were measured using the cross - correlation package rvsao ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) .",
    "we obtained preliminary velocities by cross - correlating the observations with bright wd templates of known velocity .",
    "however , greater velocity precision comes from cross - correlating j0917 + 46 with itself .",
    "thus we shifted the individual spectra to rest - frame and summed them together into a high s / n template spectrum .",
    "our final velocities come from cross - correlating the individual observations with the j0917 + 46 template , and are presented in table 1 .",
    "the radial velocity of the lowest mass wd varies by as much as 263 km s@xmath3 between different observations , revealing the presence of a companion object .",
    "we solve for the best - fit orbit using the code of kenyon & garcia ( 1986 ) .",
    "we find that the heliocentric radial velocities of the wd are best fitted with a circular orbit and a radial velocity amplitude k = 148.8 @xmath2 6.9 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we used the method of lucy & sweeney ( 1971 ) to show that there is no evidence for an eccentric orbit from our data and that the 1@xmath11 upper limit to the eccentricity is @xmath12 .",
    "we have assumed that the orbit is circular .",
    "the orbital period is 7.5936 @xmath2 0.0024 hours with spectroscopic conjunction at hjd 2454091.73 @xmath2 0.002 .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed radial velocities and our best fit model for sdss j0917 + 46 .",
    "measurement of the orbital period @xmath13 and the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity variations @xmath14 allows us to calculate the mass function    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the orbital inclination angle , @xmath17 is the wd mass ( 0.17@xmath1  for sdss j0917 + 46 ) , and @xmath18 is the mass of the companion object .",
    "we can put a lower limit on the mass of the companion by assuming an edge - on orbit ( sin @xmath19 1 ) , for which the companion would be an @xmath20@xmath1  object at an orbital separation of 1.5@xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the companion mass is @xmath4@xmath1 .",
    "to understand the nature of the companion , first we need to understand the properties of the wd .",
    "kilic et al.s ( 2007 ) analysis of j0917 + 46 was based on a single 15 minute exposure with s / n = 20 at 4000  .",
    "here we use 14 different spectra of j0917 + 46 ( 4.3 hours total exposure time ) and repeat our spectroscopic analysis .",
    "we also combine all of these spectra into a composite ( weighted average ) spectrum with @xmath22 that results in s / n = 80 at 4000  .",
    "figure 2 shows the composite spectrum and our fits using the entire spectrum ( excluding the ca k line ) and also using only the balmer lines ( see kilic et al .",
    "2007 for the details of the spectroscopic analysis ) .",
    "we find a best - fit solution of @xmath23 k and @xmath24 g = 5.55 if we use the observed composite spectrum .",
    "if we normalize ( continuum - correct ) the composite spectrum and fit just the balmer lines , then we obtain @xmath25 k and @xmath24 g = 5.51 . since we have 14 different spectra , we also fit each spectrum individually to obtain a robust estimate of the errors in our analysis . for the first case where we fit the observed spectra",
    ", we obtain a best fit solution of @xmath26 k and @xmath24 g = 5.57 @xmath27 .",
    "for the second case where we fit only the balmer lines , we obtain @xmath28 k and @xmath24 g = 5.51 @xmath29 .",
    "our results are consistent with each other and also with kilic et al.s analysis .",
    "we confirm that our temperature and gravity estimates are robust ; sdss j0917 + 46 is still the lowest gravity / mass wd currently known .",
    "we adopt our best fit solution of @xmath30 k and @xmath24 g = 5.55 @xmath27 for the remainder of the paper . using our new temperature and gravity measurements and althaus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) models , we estimate the absolute magnitude of the wd to be @xmath31 7.0 , corresponding to a distance modulus of 11.8 ( at 2.3 kpc ) and a cooling age of about 500 myr . at a galactic latitude of @xmath32 , j0917 + 46 is located at 1.6 kpc above the plane .",
    "the radial velocity of the binary system is @xmath629 km s@xmath3 .",
    "j0917 + 46 displays a proper motion of @xmath33 mas yr@xmath3 and @xmath34 mas yr@xmath3 measured from its sdss and usno - b positions ( kindly provided by j. munn ) .",
    "these measurements correspond to a tangential velocity of 31 @xmath2 52 km s@xmath3 .",
    "j0917 + 46 has disk kinematics , and its location above the galactic plane is consistent with a thick disk origin .",
    "therefore the main sequence age of the progenitor star of the lowest mass wd needs to be on the order of 10 gyr ; the progenitor was a @xmath61@xmath1  main sequence star .",
    "the broad - band spectral energy distribution of j0917 + 46 is shown in panel c in figure 2 .",
    "the de - reddened sdss photometry and the fluxes predicted for the parameters derived from our spectroscopic analysis are shown as error bars and circles , respectively .",
    "the sdss photometry is consistent with our spectroscopic solution within the errors .",
    "the @xmath35-band photometry is slightly brighter than expected , however it is within 1.7@xmath11 of our spectroscopic solution and therefore the excess is not significant .",
    "we also note that many low mass wd candidates analyzed by kilic et al .",
    "( 2007 ) had discrepant @xmath35-band photometry .",
    "a similar problem may cause the observed slight @xmath35-band excess .",
    "the mass function for our target plus the mmt spectroscopy and the sdss photometry can be used to constrain the nature of the companion star .",
    "since the companion mass has to be @xmath36@xmath1 , it can be a low mass star , another wd , or a neutron star .",
    "if the orbital inclination angle of the binary system is between 47@xmath37 and 90@xmath37 , the companion mass would be 0.28 - 0.50@xmath1 , consistent with being an m dwarf .",
    "however , an m dwarf companion would show up as an excess in the sdss photometry .",
    "for example , an m6 dwarf would cause a 10% excess in the z - band photometry of j0917 + 46 at its distance , and hence any star with @xmath38@xmath1  would be visible in the sdss photometry . since the mass function derived from the observed orbital parameters of the binary limits the companion mass to @xmath36@xmath1  ( earlier than m3.5v spectral type ) , and any such companion would be visible in the sdss photometry ( see panel c in figure 2 ) , a main sequence star companion is ruled out .",
    "we search for spectral features from a companion by subtracting all 14 individual spectra from our best - fit wd model after shifting the individual spectra to the rest - frame .",
    "the _ only _ significant feature that we detect is a ca k line .",
    "this same calcium line was also present in the discovery spectrum of j0917 + 46 ( kilic et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it had the same radial velocity as the balmer lines and hence , it was predicted to be photospheric .",
    "the ca k line is visible in all of our new spectra of this object , and its radial velocity changes with the radial velocity of the balmer lines ; it is confirmed to be photospheric .",
    "the ca h line overlaps with the saturated h@xmath39 line and it is not detected in our spectrum . if j0917 + 46 had a low mass star companion , it could contribute an additional calcium line in the spectrum .",
    "marsh et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were able to find the companion to the low mass white dwarf wd1713 + 332 by searching for asymmetries in the h@xmath40 line profile .",
    "we perform a similar analysis for j0917 + 46 using the calcium line .",
    "we combine the spectra near maximum radial velocity ( @xmath41 km s@xmath3 ) and near minimum radial velocity ( @xmath42 km s@xmath3 ) into two composite spectra",
    ". if there is a contribution from a companion object , it should be visible as an asymmetry in the line profile .",
    "this asymmetry should be on the blue side of the red - shifted composite spectrum , and on the red side of the blue - shifted composite spectrum .",
    "figure 3 shows the red - shifted ( solid line ) and blue - shifted ( dotted line ) composite spectra of j0917 + 46 .",
    "the rest - frame wavelegth of the ca k line is shown as a dashed line .",
    "this figure demonstrates that there is an asymmetry in the ca k line profile of the red - shifted spectrum , however the additional ca k feature is close to the rest - frame velocity , and it is not detected in the blue - shifted spectrum .",
    "the equivalent width of the main ca k feature in the red - shifted spectrum is 0.42 , and the additional feature has an equivalent width of @xmath60.16  .",
    "the blue shifted spectrum has a stronger ca k feature with an equivalent width of 0.57  , and it is consistent with a blend of the two ca k features seen in the red - shifted spectrum .",
    "the observed additional calcium feature seems to be stationary and it seems to originate from interstellar absorption .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our optical spectroscopy does not reveal any spectral features from a companion object .      using the most likely inclination angle for a random stellar sample , @xmath43",
    ", we estimate that the companion mass is most likely to be 0.36@xmath1 , another low mass wd .",
    "the orbital separation of the system would be about 1.6@xmath21 . if the inclination angle is between 47@xmath37 and 27@xmath37 ( 21% likelihood )",
    ", the companion mass would be 0.5 - 1.4@xmath1 , consistent with a normal carbon / oxygen or a massive wd .",
    "liebert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue that it is possible to create a 0.16 - 0.19@xmath1  wd from a 1@xmath1  progenitor star , if the binary separation is appropriate and the common - envelope phase is sufficiently unstable so that the envelope can be lost quickly from the system .",
    "we re - visit their claim to see if j0917 + 46 can be a low mass wd formed from such a progenitor system .",
    "close wd pairs can be created by two consecutive common envelope phases or an algol - like stable mass transfer phase followed by a common envelope phase ( iben et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the first scenario , due to orbital shrinkage",
    "the recently formed wd is expected to be less massive than its companion by a factor of @xmath440.55 .",
    "on the other hand , the expected mass ratio for the second scenario involving a stable mass transfer and a common - envelope phase is around 1.1 ( nelemans et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the mass ratio of the j0917 + 46 binary is @xmath45 , therefore the progenitor binary star system has probably gone through two common envelope phases .",
    "nelemans & tout ( 2005 ) found that the common - envelope evolution of close wd binaries can be reconstructed with an algorithm ( @xmath46-algorithm ) equating the angular momentum balance .",
    "the final orbital separation of a binary system that went through a common envelope phase is    @xmath47    where a is the orbital separation , @xmath18 are the masses of the companion , core , giant , and the envelope , and @xmath48 ( nelemans & tout 2005 ) .",
    "we assume that the mass of the wd is the same as the mass of the core of the giant at the onset of the mass transfer . assuming a giant mass of 0.8 - 1.3@xmath1 , a core mass of 0.17@xmath1 , and possible wd companion masses of 0.28 - 1.39@xmath1",
    ", we estimate the initial orbital separation . using the core - mass - radius relation for giants , @xmath49 ( iben & tutukov 1985 ) , we find that the radius of the giant star that created j0917 + 46 was r = @xmath50 . for @xmath18 = 0.28 - 1.39@xmath1  companions ,",
    "we use the size of the roche lobe @xmath51 as given by eggleton ( 1983 ) to determine the separation at the onset of mass transfer assuming @xmath52 .",
    "the size of the roche lobe depends on the mass ratio and the orbital separation of the system . the initial separation and the size of the roche lobe gives us a unique solution for the binary mass ratio .",
    "table 2 presents the companion mass , initial orbital separation and the orbital period for 0.8 - 1.3@xmath1  giants that could create the lowest mass wd with the observed orbital parameters .",
    "the mass function for j0917 + 46 favors a low mass wd companion , therefore the first four scenarios in table 2 seem to be more likely . for example , a 0.8@xmath1  giant and a 0.33@xmath1  wd companion with an initial orbital separation of 5.7@xmath21 and an orbital period of 36 hr would create a 0.17@xmath1  wd with the observed orbital parameters .",
    "the same procedures can be used to re - create the first common - envelope phase of the binary evolution .",
    "the progenitor of the unseen companion to j0917 + 46 must be in the range 0.8 - 2.3@xmath1 .",
    "the lower mass limit is set by the fact that the unseen companion has to be more massive than the lowest mass wd .",
    "the upper limit is set by the fact that more massive stars do not form degenerate helium cores ( nelemans et al . 2000 ) and that a common envelope phase with a more massive giant would end up in a merger and not in a binary system . assuming 0.8 - 2.3@xmath1  giants and 0.8 - 1.3@xmath1  main sequence companions , we calculate possible evolutionary scenarios to create the orbital parameters of the binary system before the last common envelope phase .",
    "we find that a 2.2@xmath1  star and a 0.8@xmath1  companion ( which is the progenitor of the lowest mass wd ) with an orbital period of 51 days and orbital separation of 0.4 au would create a 0.33@xmath1  wd .",
    "in addition , we find that the progenitor of the lowest mass wd has to be less massive than 0.9@xmath1 since a @xmath53 0.9@xmath1  progenitor would require a companion more massive than 2.3@xmath1  to match the binary properties of the system before the last common envelope phase .",
    "therefore , the most likely evolutionary scenario for a wd + wd binary involving j0917 + 46 would be : 2.2@xmath1  giant + 0.8@xmath1  star @xmath54 0.33@xmath1  wd + 0.8@xmath1  star @xmath54 0.33@xmath1  wd + 0.8@xmath1  giant @xmath54 0.33@xmath1  wd + 0.17@xmath1  wd .    the main sequence lifetime of a 2.2@xmath1  thick disk ( [ fe / h ] @xmath55 ) star is about 650 myr ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) , and a 0.33@xmath1  white dwarf created from such a system would be a @xmath610 gyr old wd . according to althaus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) models , a 0.33@xmath1  he - core wd would cool down to 3700 k in 10 gyr and it would have @xmath56 . this companion would be several orders of magnitude fainter than the 0.17@xmath1  wd observed today , and therefore the lack of evidence of a companion in the sdss photometry and our optical spectroscopy is consistent with this formation scenario .      the formation scenarios for low mass helium wds in close binary systems also include neutron star companions",
    ". there are already several low mass wds known to have neutron star companions ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "1996 ; nice et al . 2005",
    "; bassa et al . 2006 ) .",
    "according to the theoretical calculations by benvenuto & de vito ( 2005 ) , a 1@xmath1  star with a neutron star companion in an initial orbital period of 0.5 - 0.75 days would end up as a 0.05 - 0.21@xmath1  wd with a 1.8 - 1.9@xmath1  neutron star in an orbital period of 0.03 - 3.5 days .",
    "they expect a 0.17@xmath1  wd + neutron star binary to have an orbital period of 9.6 hours ( see their figure 16 ) .",
    "the orbital period of j0917 + 46 is consistent with their analysis .",
    "if the orbital inclination angle of the j0917 + 46 binary system is less than 27@xmath37 , the companion mass would be @xmath571.4@xmath1 , consistent with being a neutron star .",

    "short period binaries may merge within a hubble time by losing angular momentum through gravitational radiation .",
    "the merger time for such binaries is given by @xmath58    where the masses are in solar units and the period is in hours ( landau & lifshitz 1958 ; marsh et al .",

    "if the companion is a low mass wd with @xmath59@xmath1 , the merger time is longer than 23 gyr .",

    "j0917 + 46 binary system will not merge within the next 10 gyr .",
    "j0917 + 46 has nearly solar calcium abundance , and it has more calcium than many of the metal - rich wds with circumstellar debris disks .",
    "the extremely short timescales for gravitational settling of ca implies that the wd requires an external source for the observed metals ( koester & wilken 2006 ; kilic & redfield 2007 ) .",
    "the star is located far above the galactic plane where accretion from the ism is unlikely . a possible scenario for explaining the photospheric calcium is accretion from a circumbinary disk created during the mass loss phase of the giant . since j0917 + 46 went through a common envelope phase with a companion , a left - over circumbinary disk is possible .",
    "an accretion disk is observed around the companion to the giant mira a ( ireland et al .",
    "in addition , a fallback disk is observed around a young neutron star ( wang et al .",
    "a similar mechanism could create a circumbinary disk around j0917 + 46 .",

    "2006 ; von hippel et al .",
    "these wds are 0.2 - 1.0 gyr old .",

    "this disk could form from the left - over material from the giant phase that is ejected with less than the escape speed .",

    "<S> we report the detection of a radial velocity companion to sdss j091709.55 + 463821.8 , the lowest mass white dwarf currently known with @xmath0@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial velocity of the white dwarf shows variations with a semi - amplitude of 148.8 @xmath2 6.9 km s@xmath3 and a period of 7.5936 @xmath2 0.0024 hours , which implies a companion mass of @xmath4@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of evidence of a companion in the optical photometry forces any main - sequence companion to be smaller than 0.1@xmath1 , hence a low mass main sequence star companion is ruled out for this system . </S>",
    "<S> the companion is most likely another white dwarf , and we present tentative evidence for an evolutionary scenario which could have produced it . </S>",
    "<S> however , a neutron star companion can not be ruled out and follow - up radio observations are required to search for a pulsar companion . </S>"
