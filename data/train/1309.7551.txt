    "for a meromorphic function @xmath3 of the complex variable @xmath4 consider its decomposition into odd and even parts such that @xmath5 it is a well - known fact that for stability of a real polynomial  @xmath3 it is necessary and sufficient that the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 only have simple negative interlacing zeros and the same sign at the origin .",
    "this condition can be restated as follows : the polynomials are coprime and their ratio @xmath8 has only negative zeros and poles and is positive at the origin .",
    "this correspondence ( expressed as conditions on the hurwitz matrix ) is at the heart of the routh - hurwitz theory ( see , _ e.g. _  ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "xv ) ,  @xcite ) .",
    "with a proper extension of the notion of stability , this criterion can be generalized into entire ( see  @xcite ) , rational ( see  @xcite ) and further toward meromorphic functions .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath9 is a polynomial and we allow the ratio @xmath8 to have positive zeros and poles , then we will obtain the `` generalized hurwitz '' polynomials ( in terms of the work  @xcite ) . in the same publication ( see ( * ? ? ? * subsection  4.6 ) ) the author describes `` strange polynomials '' ( which are related to stable polynomials ) with a very specific behaviour . in the present paper the nature of this phenomenon is explained ( theorem  [ th : ca1 ] , the case  [ distr3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , here we consider a more general question . how are the zeros of a ( complex ) entire function @xmath9 distributed if the ratio  @xmath8 has only negative zeros and positive poles ? or even more generally , how are the zeros of a meromorphic function @xmath9 distributed if both functions @xmath6 and @xmath10 have only negative zeros and positive poles ?",
    "the obtained solution to the question allows us to treat a special case of a conjecture , which was stated by alan sokal ( see section  [ sec : conj - alan - sokal ] ) .",
    "this research originally began with considering that conjecture .",
    "the author is grateful to the people who made helpful comments concerning this publication , especially to the members ( former and current ) of his working group at the tu - berlin .",
    "i also thank the colleagues from potsdam and ufa for useful discussions .",
    "at first , we state our result for entire functions @xmath9 of genus one at the most .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition that the genus of the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 defined by   is equal to zero .",
    "then we discuss further extensions and alternative conditions .",
    "let entire functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 of genus 0 satisfy @xmath11 and @xmath12 , that is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a nonnegative integer , @xmath17 for all @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "we also allow the situation when one of the functions @xmath6 , @xmath23 is constant ( not both of them ) .",
    "however , we do not highlight this case specially , since the corresponding notation can be abusing .",
    "if both of these functions are constants , then the zeros of  @xmath24 satisfy @xmath25 ; so theorem  [ th : ca1 ] in such case holds only for  @xmath26 .    according to",
    ", the function @xmath9 is equal to @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are its even and odd parts , respectively .",
    "denote @xmath30 and @xmath31 here the products on @xmath32 and @xmath33 are convergent . using the notation  `` @xmath34 '' for the multivalued argument function and  `` @xmath35 '' for the principal branch of argument , @xmath36 for any  @xmath4 , we have @xmath37 furthermore , @xmath38    for the ( open ) quadrants of the complex plane we use the notation @xmath39 so that they are numbered in a counterclockwise direction .",
    "observe that @xmath40 is the same as @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the same as @xmath43 .",
    "we also denote the set of all zeros of the function  @xmath9 under consideration via  @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where each multiple zero is taken as many times as its multiplicity .",
    "[ th : ca1 ] the zeros @xmath44 are distributed as follows :    1 .",

    "moreover , for each natural @xmath49 we have @xmath69    the distribution  [ distr3 ] reflects that the function  @xmath9 is real up to a constant for real  @xmath70 , and the distribution  [ distr4 ] reflects that @xmath71 is real up to a constant for purely imaginary  @xmath70 .",
    "note that , in particular , the distributions  [ distr1][distr4 ] are `` almost uniform '' .",
    "that is , if zeros of a function are distributed as in  [ distr1 ] or  [ distr2 ] , then for any @xmath72 the number of zeros in @xmath73 can differ from the number of zeros in @xmath74 at most by @xmath75 ( here @xmath76 ) .",
    "the cases  [ distr3 ] and  [ distr4 ] are the `` degenerated '' cases [ distr1 ] and  [ distr2 ] , with possible ingress of some zeros onto the real or imaginary axes .",
    "the standard test on negativity of zeros of an entire function is grommer s criterion ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . applying this criterion immediately gives the following conditions on coefficients of the expansion into the power series .",
    "[ cr : ca3 ] let an entire function @xmath9 be of genus no more than one .",

    "conversely , if the function @xmath9 satisfies theorem  [ th : ca1 ] then for @xmath83 and @xmath84 it has the form   and the matrices   have their leading principle minors positive ( or positive up to some order and then all equal to zero , @xmath81 ) .",
    "the number of minors to be checked can be reduced if we take advantage of the results by linard and chipart .",
    "the conditions on the odd or on the even minors can be replaced with conditions on the coefficients .",
    "furthermore , in ( and only in ) the case of a polynomial @xmath9 , the number of conditions in corollary  [ cr : ca3 ] is finite ( see , _",
    "@xcite ) .    observe that if @xmath85 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath32 is a primitive @xmath86th root of unity ) and @xmath87 , then we have the identity @xmath88 consequently , the following is true .",

    "a real entire function @xmath99 is _ strongly stable _ if @xmath100 has no zeros in the closed right half of the complex plane for all complex  @xmath101 which are small enough .",
    "the notion of strong stability is not widely used .",
    "it is the `` proper '' extension to entire functions of the polynomial stability .",
    "the strongly stable functions include all stable polynomial and functions which are in some sense close to them ( for example , @xmath102 ) ; but they exclude such functions , like @xmath103 . for the case of complex functions and further details",

    ", strict stability of @xmath105 implies that the zeros of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are negative , simple and interlacing . at the same time , the interlacing property is redundant for this corollary .      a careful observer will notice that theorem  [ th : ca1 ] holds for any meromorphic function of a certain form .",
    "indeed , the following generalization is valid .    [",
