    "as complex systems , cities exhibit quantitative and qualitative change in composition as they grow in size . economies of agglomeration are one of the most debated of such transformations .",
    "research suggests that there is evidence of systematic variations in productivity levels across space , but the diversity of specifications used to estimate the magnitude of agglomeration economies makes it hard to compare studies and this leads to a wide array of differences in quantitative results . + in their review , @xcite find that city size tends to increase individual productivity by 3 to 8% . in a meta - analysis",
    ", @xcite looked at the parameters influencing this estimation in thirty - four studies where they found :    * * country specific * effects : stronger agglomeration effects are reported in studies of france and italy , compared to the usa , and they are even weaker in china , japan , sweden and the uk . * * industrial coverage * effects : agglomeration economies of service activities are larger than those estimated for the economy as a whole . *",
    "* controls and fixed * effects : controlling for differences in human capital and skills at the individual level significantly lowers the estimation of city size effects on productivity .",
    "* confounded relations from the type of * urban measures * used ( total population or density ) and their * spatial characteristics*. * a * publication bias * towards reporting a larger number of significant positive relations rather than negative or non - significant ones .    using six spatial definitions in france",
    ", @xcite looked at scale and shape effects in the estimation of the wage premium .",
    "they concluded that their impact on the coefficients measured were less important than the effect of specifications and controls used in the regressions ( the use of gross or net wages for example ) .",
    "we argue here that spatial effects are less trivial than shape and scale differences , and deserve to be studied extensively , in particular by distinguishing between urban and non - urban spaces ( i.e. geographical units larger than cities at the regional scale or smaller than cities at the local scale ) . to this end , we ask three questions : +    * are agglomeration economies specifically urban or do larger regions that include non - urban areas exhibit this behaviour too ? * does the location of economic agents within cities matter when measuring agglomeration economies ?",
    "* are larger cities more unequal ?    these questions have not been studied much despite the fact that population cutoffs and spatial definitions affect the variation of _ per capita _ measures across city size @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the diversity of the urban landscape within cities is populated by different kinds of activities and different classes of population with different economic characteristics .",
    "we therefore expect that the way cities are defined matters in the estimation of agglomeration economies , the wage premium and internal inequalities .",
    "we start by reviewing the different economic mechanisms which might cause wealth , income and productivity to cluster in cities , in cities of larger sizes , and in neighbourhoods of particular affluence .",
    "we find that the mixed evidence from the literature is paralleled by a diversity in different theories as to the causes ( section [ sec : cause ] ) and _ loci _ ( section [ sec : geo ] ) of agglomeration economies .",
    "this leads us to articulate in section [ sec : why ] our own hypotheses about why urban definition should be of importance in the estimation of agglomeration economies .      what we refer to here as a causal limit to agglomeration relates to the direction from which wage and income premia arise between cities and individuals as articulated in different economic theories .",
    "from the causes and reinforcing mechanisms of agglomeration economies within the framework of regional science , urban economics and the new economic geography , we find two groups of explanations .",
    "the first acknowledges a retroaction of cities on people ( making them more productive , providing them with more knowledge , interactions and opportunities , etc . ) , whereas the second focuses on the micro foundations of aggregate measurements of the wage premium as well as of the spatial accumulation of wealth .",
    "+ @xcite summarises the first group into three classes of mechanisms .",
    "larger cities and markets allow for increased : sharing ( infrastructure and facilities ) , matching ( demand and supply for products and skills ) and learning ( of new practices and technologies ) .",
    "these causal chains rely on the effect of city size and large - scale amenities with high fixed costs @xcite to increase the output measured at the aggregate level .",
    "another type of explanation involves the self sorting of the most productive and educated workers in the largest cities @xcite .",
    "sorting describes the fact that economic agents of different educational attainments choose different locations , corresponding to different but equivalent bargains ( typically : higher salary and higher rents in large cities or lower salary and lower rents in smaller cities ) , depending on their preferences for different sets of amenities .",
    "the distribution of jobs is assumed to follow the realisation of individual preferences and individual real income levels to be equivalent in cities of different sizes .",
    "however , the concentration of highly educated workers affects the productive composition of large cities and boosts the total income generated compared to smaller cities .",
    "+ from an aggregate perspective , @xcite reviews potential mechanisms explaining the distribution of activity in space as an equilibrium between centripetal forces ( natural and relative location advantages , market size , knowledge spillovers ) and centrifugal forces ( commuting costs , urban land rents , congestion and pollution ) driving the location of firms and individuals as a consequence . in this framework , agglomeration economies occur where centripetal exceed centrifugal forces .",
    "+ consequently there seem to be two major ways of looking at higher wages and incomes in larger agglomerations : either urban concentrations produce higher productivity _ per se _ , or it is because highly productive workers and industries have similar location preferences . in the latter case ,",
    "no real economic premium exists at the individual level in the largest cities as larger wages only compensate for larger rents , although @xcite suggest that this leads to larger cities being more unequal ( due to complementarities in extreme skills ) .",
    "similarly , either individual preferences or particular urban characteristics explain the variety of city sizes .",
    "these theoretical but undecided options suggest further empirical investigations , and add to the definitional sources of confusion : what are the most appropriate spatial limits of agglomerations and which economic quantity is most relevant to measure agglomeration effects ?      two major sources of confusion ( city definition and economic specifications ) have hampered the empirical testing of results drawn from models that have originated in the new economic geography and the new urban economics .",
    "+ @xcite and @xcite point to the unclear , undefined or usually over - simplified concepts of space and time which plague most theories of agglomeration economies .",
    "the extreme example of this simplification of space is the linear space that is assumed in the classic textbook by @xcite .",
    "beyond this simplification , there does not appear to be any agreement about the scale at which agglomeration economies emerge .",
    "most authors refer to cities usually as homogeneous objects @xcite , whereas some refer more broadly to industrial districts @xcite , dense urban spaces @xcite or to small regions @xcite .",
    "some researchers have explicitly questioned the right scale at which these processes occur @xcite . from a concentration analysis in the us performed at different geographical levels ( from zip codes to states ) ,",
    "@xcite conclude that different causes of agglomeration play out at each geographical level .",
    "@xcite examine the link between small employment districts and city - level measures of urban externalities and conclude that smaller units generate higher levels because cities are internally heterogeneous , with employment highly concentrated in their central parts and people of different income levels located in different areas . finally despite limits on data , some theoretical urban arguments are empirically tested with regional data on exhaustive partitions , which seems problematic .",
    "+ in this paper , we evaluate the hypothesis that the city is the relevant unit to observe agglomeration economies as well as internal inequalities .",
    "we do not take this statement for granted but explore and compare results for different geographies .",
    "our exploration is motivated by a search for robustness but also because we think there are theoretical reasons why urban definitional criteria should play a role in the estimation of urban inequalities .",
    "+ the second source of definitional confusion relates to what is measured empirically when referring to `` economies '' , `` rich populations '' or `` premium wages '' .",
    "indeed , the lack of comparability between empirical studies from the literature emerges from the variety of economic outputs that relate to city size . typically , the theoretical prediction which we want to verify with empirical data is the increase in added value per capita with city size ( or agglomeration of population ) @xcite .",
    "however , added value is seldom measured at local levels of administrative geography , so wages are often taken as a proxy for productivity levels @xcite .",
    "moreover , taking nominal or real wages and controlling for education levels and/or housing prices have important impacts on empirical results @xcite .",
    "we also observe a strong theoretical difference between measuring wage ( or income ) premium at the individual level of workers located in cities on the one hand @xcite , and evaluating the effect of population size on the mass of income produced and its distribution in cities on the other @xcite .",
    "+ finally , when looking at inequality , a more classical indicator of wealth differences is income .",
    "this derives for some part from the revenue of labour ( although with large variations across the income distribution of households ) , and for the rest from capital profits and welfare transfers @xcite .",
    "these two specifications are thus not necessarily strongly correlated in space , as we know that the distribution of production and consumption at residence locations do not coincide @xcite .",
    "the uneven spatial distribution of income in cities is explained by models of segregation , but wage premia , income inequality , and segregation are rarely associated with city size even though the distribution of wealth is of paramount importance in urban processes of production and growth @xcite .",
    "the key ( and overarching ) question of urban socioeconomics seems to be this : as cities get larger , do they get richer , but also more unequal and segregated @xcite ?",
    "+ because all these processes are linked and localised in cities , we strongly expect their spatial delimitation to play a strong role in the empirical estimation of agglomeration economies and inequalities , as well as the obvious effects of econometric specification .",
    "we also expect these variations to tell a story about the social and morphological heterogeneity of urban space .",
    "we see four reasons why size effects on production and income inequality should vary with urban definitions .",
    "[ [ because - agglomeration - economies - are - considered - to - be - urban . ] ] because agglomeration economies are considered to be urban .",
    "if processes of learning , sharing , matching and sorting are enhanced by urban characteristics ( such as the density of interactions ) , then the measure of agglomeration economies and scaling of economic variables needs to be performed on urban objects .",
    "a unique set of criteria to define cities is obviously illusory ( as cities can be defined in many valid but non equivalent ways @xcite ) , but it is clear that the same estimation performed at an urban and a regional level are supposed to give different results .    [ [ because - the - estimation - of - other - parameters - changes - with - city - definition . ] ] because the estimation of other parameters changes with city definition .    when studying the concentration of infrastructural and socio - economic attributes with city size , the choice of definitional criteria ( density , flow and population thresholds to spatially delineate urban clusters ) has proven to affect the value of scaling estimates @xcite .    [",
    "[ because - cities - are - heterogeneously - populated - and - used - for - activities . ] ] because cities are heterogeneously populated and used for activities .",
    "jobs and amenities are more concentrated than the resident population in cities @xcite .",
    "this feature has increased since the 1950s because of the development of automobile mobility and the sprawl of residential population beyond the built - up area of cities .",
    "therefore restrictive and extensive delineations do not capture the same activities within their urban boundaries and the resulting activity composition might be affected differently by size effects .",
    "finally , in terms of social landscapes and income inequality , @xcite and @xcite note for contemporary france , that different urban morphologies tend to coincide with different mixes of activities ( productive and residential ) , but also with different population categories : recent immigrants and young professionals tend to reside in the densest parts of the largest metropolises , pockets of suburban wealth belong to their periphery , whereas rural areas and the outskirts of medium - sized and smaller cities concentrate deprived households .",
    "this implies that including some or all these heterogeneous spaces in the delineation of cities will modify the picture of urban wealth and inequality , and potentially its relation to city size .",
    "[ [ because - geolocated - estimations - are - subject - to - spatial - biases - in - general . ] ] because geolocated estimations are subject to spatial biases in general .",
    "there is a large body of literature that has focused on the aggregation biases in spatial measures associated with varying administrative boundaries .",
    "the modifiable area unit problem ( maup ) @xcite affects the measurement of concentration @xcite and segregation @xcite in general , so we must expect estimations of agglomeration economies and urban inequality to behave similarly and respond to the variations of shape and scale of the units defined as urban .",
    "the aim of this paper is to test this assumption and evaluate the significance of this variation on possible conclusions , using the data and methods exposed in the following section .",
    "for this experiment , we use multiple definitions of cities applied to three sets of recent french data :    * * population data * are gathered for 36546 local units from the 2011 french population census ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : com ] ) and aggregated into higher levels of geography ( cf .",
    "figures [ fig : uu ] to [ fig : dep ] ) . *",
    "* income data * are provided by the taxation office .",
    "it gives for each local unit the sum of income declared by the fiscal households ( people who declare their income together ) for the year 2011 .",
    "the distributional income data refer to the number of households in each taxation bracket of declared income of 2011 and their aggregated income at the local unit level .",
    "unfortunately , the 8 taxation brackets do not correspond to regular quantiles of households .",
    "their distribution is displayed in table [ tab : income ] .",
    ".distribution of french households per income , 2011 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     com stands for _ communes _ , the french local spatial units , uu for _ units urbaines _ ( the definition of city cores ) , au for _ aires urbaines _ ( metropolitan areas ) and dep for the nuts 3 level ( _ dpartements _ ) .",
