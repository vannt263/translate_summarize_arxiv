    "the formalism proposed by e. verlinde@xcite obtains the gravitational acceleration by using the holographic principle and the equipartition law of energy .",
    "his ideas relied on the fact that gravitation can be considered universal and independent of the details of spacetime microstructure .",
    "besides , he brought new concepts concerning holography since the holographic principle must unify matter , gravity and quantum mechanics .",
    "it is important to mention that similar ideas have also been given by padmanabhan@xcite .    an important concept used by verlinde",
    "is the notion of bits in which it can be understood as the smallest unit of information in a holographic screen .",
    "indeed , bits play an essential role in verlinde formalism because when the total bits number is assumed to satisfy completely the equipartition law of energy , we have the well known formula of the classical gravitational acceleration .",
    "so , the aim of this work is to show that when we consider that the total number of bits no longer satisfies the equipartition theorem then , at first , we can obtain two important results which are both the quantum correction of the gravitational acceleration and mond - type theory@xcite .    in other words , we will obtain a constant parameter ( @xmath0 ) that is a measure of how much a difference between classical and quantum results concerning the number of bits is relevant .",
    "we will see that this difference is not conserved at the quantum level . in the second part of this work ,",
    "the @xmath0-parameter is a temperature function and a phase transition and critical phenomena analysis is provided .",
    "this paper is organized in a way such that in section 2 we have depicted very briefly some verlinde s entropic concepts . in section 3",
    "we have computed the @xmath1 to show that @xmath2 is not conserved at the quantum level . in section 4",
    "we have provided a brief review of mond s main ideas . in section 5",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0-parameter through mond theory . in section 6",
    "we have carried out a phase transition and critical phenomena analysis on the holographic screen based on the computation of the @xmath0-parameter . in section 7",
    "the conclusions are written .",
    "before we begin to describe our proposal , let us review , in a short way , the verlinde formalism .",
    "the model considers a spherical surface as being the holographic screen , with a particle of mass @xmath3 positioned in its center .",
    "the holographic screen can be imagined as a storage device for information .",
    "the number of bits , which is the smallest unit of information in the holographic screen , is assumed to be proportional to the holographic screen area @xmath4 @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the planck length and @xmath8 is the planck area .",
    "we can see clearly that the connection between @xmath9 and @xmath10 characterizes @xmath9 as a quantum parameter .",
    "it means that its introduction can be considered a semiclassical feature . in verlinde s framework",
    "one can suppose that the bits total energy on the screen is given by the equipartition law of energy    @xmath11    it is important to notice that the usual equipartition theorem in eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) , can be derived from the usual boltzmann - gibbs thermostatistics .",
    "let us consider that the energy of the particle inside the holographic screen is equally divided by all bits in such a manner that we can have the expression    @xmath12    with eq .",
    "( [ bits ] ) and using the unruh temperature equation @xcite given by    @xmath13    we are able to obtain the ( absolute ) gravitational acceleration equation    @xmath14    from eq .",
    "( [ acc ] ) we can see that newton s constant @xmath15 is just written in terms of the fundamental constants , @xmath16 .",
    "it is well known that the infrared behavior of quantum gravity is more interesting than the ultraviolet one .",
    "however , the low energy propagation of massless particles leads us to quantum corrections for long distances . in this way",
    ", the effective action may be expanded in a taylor momentum expansion . in the current literature ,",
    "the standard calculation procedure is through feynman rules . in a different way , in this section we will use the holographic and equipartition law ideas to compute the quantum correction to the newtonian potential .",
    "we begin our formalism by rewriting expression ( [ eq ] ) in a similar form as the one from padmanabhan@xcite , except by the fact that we consider just the holographic screen , as @xmath17    then , our proposal is to assume that there is a numerical difference between the total bits s number in the holographic screen and the bits number that exist in the equipartition @xmath18 or @xmath19 where    @xmath20    and    @xmath21    hence , as we have said before , we can understand that the @xmath0-parameter measures the difference between the quantum @xmath22 and the classical @xmath23 objects .",
    "however , since @xmath22 and @xmath23 are two objects that provide one quantity , namely , the number of bits , naively one can say that @xmath24 .",
    "but here we will make two assumptions .",
    "the first one is that @xmath25 but not zero .",
    "and the second one is that @xmath26 , namely , @xmath27 .",
    "we believe that both assumptions are not very different from reality . since they are simple assumptions , any result that contradicts any one of them will be easily noticed .",
    "initially if we consider that the @xmath0 parameter is a constant then ( [ dif ] ) can be written as    @xmath28    performing a binomial expansion in ( [ conta1 ] ) we obtain that @xmath29 where we have assumed that @xmath30 . using the unruh temperature formula , eq.([un ] ) , and @xmath31 in ( [ conta12 ] ) , we can obtain a modified gravitational acceleration    @xmath32    the second term in eq.([conta2 ] ) is the first order non - relativistic quantum correction to the gravitational acceleration .",
    "there are several works that show different results for the coefficient @xmath0 when general relativity is treated as an effective field theory . among them",
    "we can mention works of donoghue@xcite , akhundov et al@xcite and bjerrum - bohr et al@xcite . as a simple potential",
    "can not be considered an ideal relativistic concept , the general corrections would have the following expression    @xmath33    where the @xmath34-parameter would rely on the exact definition of the potential [ 8 ] .",
    "it would be computed in the post - newtonian expansion .",
    "the factor @xmath35 is dimensionless and gives an expression parameter for the long distance quantum effects .",
    "the values of @xmath34 can be summarized in the table i    [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     1 cm we will use that the gravitational acceleration is related to the potential through the equation @xmath36 then from ( [ conta2 ] ) and ( [ conta5 ] ) we can obtain a connection between @xmath34 and @xmath0 given by    @xmath37    observing table i we can see that the first two negative results means that the number of bits that satisfy the equipartition theorem is greater than the total number of bits of the holographic screen .",
    "we consider that these results are not consistent with our proposal because we have assumed that @xmath38",
    ". only the positive @xmath39 agrees with our model , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "we can imagine that @xmath0 represents a small number of bits on the holographic screen .",
    "we have verified that if @xmath40 then the value of @xmath34 obtained by eq .",
    "( [ conta7 ] ) approximately reproduces the value of @xmath34 given by bjerrum - bohr et al .",
    "in fact , 49 bits is an extremely small value compared , as an example , with the number of bits on the holographic screen , eq.([bits ] ) , with radius 1 m that is @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 can be interpreted as a fluctuation in the equality of the bits number of the holographic screen and the bits number that satisfies the equipartition theorem .",
    "a small deviation of equality ( [ class ] ) leads to a quantum correction in the gravitational acceleration .",
    "it is important to mention here that in our proposal we are not using any usual procedure of a quantum field theory or effective field theory for the gravitational interaction .",
    "only the holographic principle and the equipartition theorem which are the basis of the verlinde formalism were used .",
    "the mond theory successfully explains the majority of the rotation curves of the galaxies .",
    "mond theory reproduces the well known tully - fisher relation@xcite and it can be also an alternative to dark matter .    basically , this theory is a modification of newton s second law in which the force can be described as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is a function with the following properties : @xmath44 for @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 is a constant .",
    "there are different interpolation functions for @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "however , it is believed that the main implications caused by mond theory do not depend on the specific form of these functions .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , it is usual to assume that the variation of @xmath43 between the asymptotic limits occurs abruptly at @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "let us consider @xcite that , below a critical temperature , the cooling of the holographic screen is not homogeneous .",
    "we choose that the fraction of bits with zero energy is given by the equation    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the total number of bits given by the equation ( [ bits ] ) , @xmath52 is the number of bits with zero energy and @xmath53 is the critical temperature .",
    "for @xmath54 we have that @xmath55 and for @xmath56 the zero energy phenomenon for some bits starts to occur .",
    "equation ( [ mond2 ] ) is a standard relation of critical phenomena and second order phase transitions theory . from ( [ mond2 ] )",
    "the number of bits with energy different from zero for a given temperature @xmath57 is    @xmath58    considering that the energy of the particle inside the holographic screen is equally distributed over all bits with nonzero energy and using relation ( [ mond2 ] ) in the equipartition law of energy , we obtain that    @xmath59    then , combining ( [ bits ] ) , ( [ un ] ) and ( [ mond4 ] ) , we are able to derive , for @xmath57 , the mond theory for newton s law of gravitation    @xmath60    where    @xmath61    using @xmath62 we obtain @xmath63 , an extremely low temperature which is far from the usual temperature observed in our real word .",
    "from eqs.([mond1 ] ) and ( [ mond4 ] ) we can deduce that the argument of the interpolation function @xmath43 can be written as @xmath64 so , in our mond - type theory we are considering that the interpolation function is    @xmath65    in figure 1 we plot @xmath66 as function of @xmath67 .    . ]    this interpolation function , eq.([interpo ] ) , is not a widely - used interpolating function@xcite in mond s theory and because of this reason that we have called our model as mond - type theory .",
    "however , the use of this interpolation function in our approach leads to a second order phase transition phenomenon in mond s theory where we can derive critical exponents .    considering that there is a difference between the number of bits in the holographic screen and the number of bits that exists in the equipartition law",
    ", we can choose a particular expression for the @xmath0-parameter , eq.([dif ] ) , that leads to mond - type theory . to do this",
    "we will write eq.([mond3 ] ) in the form    @xmath68    or @xmath69 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is defined in eqs.([dif3 ] ) and ( [ dif4 ] ) respectively .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath54 we have @xmath70 , since above the critical temperature @xmath53 we have that @xmath71 .",
    "then , from eq.([mond7 ] ) , the @xmath0-parameter is given by    @xmath72    which shows that in our mond - type theory the @xmath0-parameter depends on the temprature .",
    "in order to establish our results within the context of phase transition and critical phenomena , we plot in figure 2 , as an example , a typical spontaneous magnetization curve@xcite . we can observe that for temperatures below @xmath53 the magnetization is different from zero and for temperatures above @xmath53 the magnetization is zero .    in figure 3",
    "we have plotted eq.([mond8 ] ) as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "also , we can observe that for temperatures below @xmath53 the bits difference number is different from zero and for temperatures above @xmath53 the bits difference number is zero . comparing both figures we can notice some similarities between the two graphics .    .",
    "]    , as function of @xmath67 . ]",
    "if we consider @xmath73 as an order parameter@xcite then we can observe that the critical exponent @xmath34 associated with the order parameter is equal to 1 , i.e.    @xmath74    where @xmath75    and @xmath76 .",
    "we can use a scaling law for critical exponents , called josephson scaling@xcite which can be written as    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the correlation length critical exponent , i.e.    @xmath79    and @xmath80 is the space dimension . in a short description ,",
    "the correlation length is a measure of the range in which the fluctuations in one region of space are correlated with those in another region .",
    "two points which are separated by a distance larger than the correlation length will each one have fluctuations where they are expected to be independent , i.e. , uncorrelated . experimentally , the correlation length is found to diverge at the critical point .",
    "the derivative of energy @xmath81 with respect to temperature , which is the heat capacity at constant volume , is zero because in the verlinde formalism the energy is a constant ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "therefore the critical exponent @xmath0 is zero . from the josephson scaling law , eq.([sl ] ) , we obtain that @xmath82 since @xmath83 in verlinde s formalism .",
    "so , the correlation length near @xmath84 is    @xmath85    which shows that at @xmath86 the correlation length , @xmath87 , also diverges in our model . this important result ( which confirms what we have mentioned before ) indicates that there is a phase transition in the holographic screen from newton to mond s regime .",
    "two recent formalisms that were originated in order to introduce alternative models concerning gravity theory , the so - called mond and verlinde s entropic gravity promoted a whole scientific research .",
    "the first one had the objective to explain the galaxies rotation curves and it was considered as an alternative to dark matter .",
    "the second one was aimed to continue the ideas of beckenstein and hawking who explored the black holes thermodynamics through entropic concepts and the unruh thermodynamical acceleration definition , we can obtain newton s gravitational law .    in this work ,",
    "we have used both frameworks to obtain an @xmath0-parameter which has worked as a measure for classical / quantum differences and to analyze the phase transition and critical phenomena .",
    "what is new here about these results is that both are considered on the holographic screen , which is an important concept in the current information theory .",
    "the first result concerning the @xmath0-parameter has shown that the difference between the number of bits on the holographic screen ( @xmath22 ) and the equipartition law ( @xmath23 ) is not zero , as one would expect . in other words , since we have shown also that @xmath0 has quantum features , at the quantum level , @xmath88 is not conserved , which could be considered as a kind of anomaly .",
    "the @xmath0-parameter has also appeared as the perturbative correction of the newton law and we have compared it with other values obtained in the literature .",
    "considering mond , we have obtained another relative value for @xmath88 . however , considering phase transition and critical phenomena in the holographic screen , we have demonstrated precisely that the correlation length diverges during the phase transition . consequently , there is a phase transition in the holographic screen .",
