    "in recent five years , much attention has been paid to the problem of evolving networks @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the problem can be summarized as follows : we consider a graph , initially small , of @xmath2 nodes .",
    "a new @xmath8-th node is linked to @xmath9 nodes , selected randomly from @xmath2 previously existing nodes , with probability of linking to a given node dependent on its degree , i.e. its number of edges @xmath10 .",
    "if this probability is constant , we get the so - called exponential network  this term is due to the exponential distribution @xmath11 of the number of edges of a node @xcite .",
    "the distribution @xmath11 is often treated as giving most essential local characteristics of the network .",
    "example giving , for the cayley tree @xmath12 .",
    "if the probability of linking to a node is proportional to the node degree @xmath10 , the network is scale - free , i.e. the distribution @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "this kind of networks is called `` barabsi  albert networks '' from the names of the inventors @xcite .",
    "the scale - free character has been discovered in many real networks : a network of web pages which are available one from another , a network of coauthors of scientific papers , a network of actors playing roles in the same movies and some others . in any case , the evolving procedure is to be considered as a non - equilibrium process .",
    "here we focus on the mean distance @xmath1 between nodes in trees , where @xmath0 . in trees ,",
    "the path between each two nodes is unique and it can not be changed during the system evolution . a number of results on @xmath1 in trees has been derived recently for uncorrelated random networks @xcite .",
    "these results are based on scaling hypotheses and/or assumptions of lack of correlations between nodes .",
    "the goal of the present work is to calculate @xmath15 numerically for the exponential trees and the barabsi ",
    "albert @xmath0 scale - free networks , and analytically for the exponential trees .",
    "our analytical results are formulated in terms of iterative equations and they are exact also for small trees .",
    "the numerical algorithm is as follows : an initial tree is composed of two nodes connected by an edge .",
    "each time when a @xmath8-th node is added to a @xmath16-th node , the distance @xmath17 between the new node and any other ( say , @xmath18-th one ) is @xmath19 .",
    "the set of distances can be presented as a symmetric matrix @xmath20 . adding a new node",
    "is represented by an enlargement of the matrix size by one .",
    "the last @xmath8-th column and row are equal to one plus the @xmath16-th column ( or row ) , where @xmath16 is the index of a node to which the new node is attached ( see fig .  [ fig_matrix ] ) .    the mean distance , i.e. the average length @xmath1 , is just the average over the nondiagonal matrix elements . obviously , the diagonal elements are zero .",
    "the obtained curve @xmath15 is an average over @xmath21 trees .",
    "the results on @xmath22 ( hereafter abbreviated as @xmath1 ) for the exponential trees and for the scale - free trees they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_d ] .    for large @xmath2",
    ", the obtained curves can be well approximated as linear with @xmath23 .",
    "namely we get @xmath24 for the exponential trees and @xmath25 for the scale - free trees .",
    "preliminary numerical results on the dispersion for both kind of trees suggest that for large @xmath2 , the dispersion @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the same as for the average distance @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively for the exponential and the scale - free trees .",
    "during the tree growth , the size of the matrix @xmath20 of distances between nodes increases . then , the time evolution of a tree is equivalent to the evolution of the matrix size @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the evolution of the ensemble average of the distance matrix @xmath20 .",
    "the mean distance @xmath15 between nodes , averaged over all pairs of nodes @xmath30 and trees @xmath31 with @xmath2 nodes can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the probability of a tree @xmath31 of size @xmath2 , and it is normalized to unity within the set of all possible trees with @xmath2 nodes .",
    "although we are interested in @xmath1 , it is easier to work just with the average matrix element @xmath34 , which includes diagonal elements",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36    the relation @xmath37 comes from the obvious fact that the diagonal element @xmath38 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath34 is given by @xmath39 because the matrix @xmath20 is symmetrical and @xmath40 .",
    "in the first sum of the latter expression , the average over trees with @xmath8 nodes is performed over the sum of matrix elements which depend on the subgraph @xmath31 .",
    "that is why in fact @xmath41 is the boundary distribution @xmath33 , and the information on the @xmath8-th node is averaged out . in the second sum , @xmath42 , where the latter is the conditional probability of attaching a new node to a preexisting node indexed by @xmath16 . on the other hand , we have again @xmath43",
    "this is the same rule which has been helpful in the numerical calculations , described above . substituting all that to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we get @xmath44    the first term on r.h.s .",
    "is nothing but @xmath45 ; the problem is with the last term . for scale - free trees ,",
    "the probability @xmath46 is proportional to the degree of the node @xmath16 in the tree @xmath31 , i.e. it is equal to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a tree - dependent constant .",
    "substituting it to eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we obtain the relation between the average distance between nodes of trees with @xmath8 nodes and the average distance from a node of degree @xmath10 to any other node in trees with @xmath2 nodes .",
    "this relation , even if natural , seems hard to use further .    on the contrary , for the exponential trees",
    "this term can be extracted out from the sum and we get a compact iterative relation @xmath50    substituting @xmath51 , we get @xmath52    the same manipulations are possible with the moments of higher order .",
    "the average of the squared matrix element is @xmath53    applying it to the exponential trees , we get the relation @xmath54    we start from the only existing tree of @xmath55 ; obviously @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "successive values of @xmath15 , @xmath58 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_exptre ] together with the respective results of the simulation .    as we see , the agreement is good . for high values of @xmath2 , the plots are linear with @xmath59 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the obtained coefficients are : @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "for both kinds of trees , the terms of @xmath1 and @xmath63 leading in @xmath2 are proportional to @xmath23 , with apparently the same coefficients ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the exponential trees and the barabsi  albert scale - free trees , respectively ) .",
    "this means , that in both cases the term in @xmath63 proportional to @xmath64 cancels .",
    "the selecting of subsequent nodes to attach new nodes is equivalent to a random walk in the space of all trees . at each step , the number of possibilities  nodes where a new node can be attached  increases . in principle , the number @xmath65 of trees used in the averaging procedure should increase in time to have a good statistics , but such a simulation would be time - consuming . if @xmath65 is much smaller than the maximal size @xmath2 of trees , the averaging is not ergodic and numerical errors can increase .    in our formulation ,",
    "the weights of particular trees of size @xmath8 do depend on the weights of trees of size @xmath2 from which they are formed .",
    "this dependence is specific for the process of growing of the trees . in consequence ,",
    "our results differ from those obtained within the equilibrium statistical mechanics , e.g. in @xcite",
