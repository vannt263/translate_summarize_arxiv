    "one way of separating a superparamagnet , where spins form non - interacting clusters , from a spin - glass , which contains long range correlations is by looking at the frequency sensitivity of @xmath36  @xcite :    @xmath37    generally metallic canonical spin - glasses have values of @xmath38 , insulating spin - glasses have values in the region @xmath39 and shifts higher than this are typical of superparamagnets .",

    "fits , the low values of @xmath35 appear to indicate that the entities freezing out are clusters rather than individual spins .",
    "this seems somewhat unlikely as cluster size seemingly increases as er content decreases , but could be due to the spins existing with a long - range ordered matrix .",
    "this embedded spin - glass state shares some similarities with the _ anti - glass _ state observed in liho@xmath146y@xmath147f@xmath2  @xcite . more specifically in both compounds there is a clear deviation from arrhenius law behavior of the spin - glass freezing temperature , but with no evidence of a zero - frequency freezing temperature .",

    "inhomogeneous mean - field ( imf ) calculations on a lattice of 100 x 100 x 100 unit cells gives identical results to the vcmf , implying the effect is not simply due to the disorder in the location of magnetic moments and confirming the system is no longer mean - field .",
    "in investigating this reduction of @xmath7 , we came across an interesting result .",
    "if the @xmath7 obtained from mean - field is multiplied with an additional @xmath17 , then there is a remarkably good agreement with the experimental phase diagram as seen in fig .",
    "[ phasediag_mf ] . for the time being we have no theoretical argument that this is more than a coincidence , although it could prove a useful starting point for additional theoretical work .",
    "further calculations to explain the rapidly decreasing @xmath10 have been carried out .",
    "first , the hamiltonian containing only the two lowest crystal field levels was diagonalized for a small cluster of 8 ho ions surrounding a central er ion ( 4 nearest neighbors , 4 next nearest neighbors ) in the presence of the temperature dependent mean - field generated in pure lihof@xmath2 .",
    "these calculations gave identical results to the mean - field ones - the er becomes polarized by the ho ions , increasing @xmath10 .",
    "similar calculations using the full hamiltonian were carried out for an er ion with 4 nearest - neighbor ho ions , giving the same result . as there is a slight change in lattice parameters for lihof@xmath2 and lierf@xmath2 , on the order of 0.5 % ,",
    "another possibility is that the distorted lattice could influence the crystal field levels . to investigate this hypothesis , point",
    "charge crystal field calculations were carried out for a variety of symmetrical lattice distortions and the resulting crystal field used in vcmf calculations .",
    "the net effect of the distortions was a change in @xmath10 far too small to explain the experimental data .",
    "more theoretical work must be carried out in order to understand the dependence of @xmath10 as a function of er content .",
    "it is clear from the calculations already carried out that it is not a local quantum or classical effect and therefore probably a long range effect .",
    "given the success of classical monte carlo simulations  @xcite in explaining the non - mf behavior observed in liho@xmath0y@xmath1f@xmath2 for @xmath148 , these calculations may shed more light on the situation .",
    "as @xmath17 decreases , the ferromagnetic component in the @xmath31 disappears completely . in @xmath28 on the other hand , the peak due to the spin - glass begins to widen .",
    "given the existence of a spin - glass embedded within the ferromagnetic state for larger @xmath17 , it seems likely that this widening is due to two physically distinct transitions .",
    "indeed the large difference in the form of @xmath81 and @xmath80 indicate that at high temperatures an ising spin - glass forms and at lower temperatures an @xmath3 spin - glass forms within this glass .",
    "the neutron scattering data on @xmath84 confirms the presence of the ising spin - glass , which consists of elongated needle - like clusters .",
    "this kind of spin - glass where at high temperatures the ising moments freeze out then at lower temperatures the xy moments freeze has been theoretically predicted for mixed anisotropy spin - glasses  @xcite .      moving to even lower @xmath17",
    ", the susceptibility evolves continuously towards that of a canonical spin glass , where the features in both real and imaginary susceptibility are analogous to those seen in the canonical spin glasses @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering measurements confirm the presence of short - range correlations as are present in spin glasses .",
    "surprisingly , these correlations are anti - ferromagnetic in nature , not ferromagnetic as could be expected for ho ions . mapping the correlations in the scattering plane",
    "reveals an ellipsoidal correlation volume with major radius of @xmath149 along the c - axis and minor radius of @xmath150 along the a - axis .",
    "the field and temperature dependence of the correlations is consistent with previous studies on spin glasses , where there is a monotonic decrease in intensity as a function of temperature and field .",
    "to conclude , we have measured the experimental phase diagram of liho@xmath0er@xmath1f@xmath2 , finding a rich phase diagram with at least three distinct regions . at large @xmath17",
    "the system is a ferromagnet with a low - temperature embedded spin glass . for @xmath151",
    "the system likely consists of two coexisting spin - glasses , one of which freezes at around 0.5 k and the other at around 0.2 k. at lower @xmath17 the features of the spin - glass sharpen and by @xmath90 there is only evidence of a single spin - glass state showing antiferromagnetic spin - spin correlations .",
