    "magnetic reconnection is one of the most important subjects in the studies of space , laboratory , and astrophysical plasmas @xcite . in particular , it plays an essential role in the understanding of energy conversion processes in high energy plasmas that characterize astrophysical compact objects , such as neutron stars @xcite , soft gamma - ray repeaters @xcite , active galactic nuclei @xcite , and gamma - ray bursts .    while issues concerning the physical mechanisms and properties of magnetic reconnection remain unsettled in the relativistic regime , a few theoretical studies of relativistic effects",
    "have been made @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied relativistic sweet  parker type reconnection within the framework of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , finding that the reconnection - driven outflow can have an ultra - relativistic speed ( lorentz factor @xmath4 ) when the magnetic energy is preferentially converted to kinetic energy .",
    "they concluded that the reconnection rate would be enhanced in the relativistic regime due to lorentz contraction .",
    "in contrast , @xcite concluded that the outflow can not be accelerated to a relativistic speed ( @xmath5 ) because the magnetic energy should be converted into thermal energy to maintain the pressure balance across the current sheet .",
    "the effect of the lorentz contraction is then negligible and the reconnection rate would not be enhanced .",

    "since the lorentz factor of the outflow is of order unity , the enhancement of the reconnection rate due to the lorentz contraction is ineffective .",

    "1d , the model of b2r10 ) .",
    "an increase in the reconnection rate following the instability is also observed in non - relativistic reconnection .",
    "once the tearing instability develops , the current sheet is disrupted and the system evolves to a non - steady state .",
    "a remarkable feature is that the increase in the outflow velocity coincides with the enhancement of the reconnection rate ( e.g. , @xmath154 of model b2r10 in figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "although the reason for the acceleration is not yet clear , we speculate that the outflow is accelerated by the pressure gradient force . when the plasmoid created due to the tearing instability flows along the current sheet , the plasma in the current sheet is swept up by it",
    "the subsequent outflow can then be accelerated by the pressure gradient force ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1]d ) . since the plasma inertia @xmath155 decreases while it is accelerated by the pressure gradient force , the outflow speed might be ultra - relativistic @xmath4 .",
    "in such cases , relativistic effects would facilitate the energy conversion in the reconnection process .",
