    "it is a high - mass x - ray binary system located at a distance of 2.0@xmath20.2  kpc @xcite .",
    "the system contains a rapidly rotating early type b0ve star with a persistent equatorial decretion disk and mass loss , and a compact object with a mass between 1 and 4  @xmath3 orbiting it every @xmath426.5  d in an eccentric orbit ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "was classified as a microquasar based on structures detected from five to several tens of milliarcseconds with the european vlbi network ( evn ) and merlin ( @xcite , and references therein ) , although analysis of later evn and merlin data sets does not reveal the presence of such structures @xcite .",
    "very long baseline array ( vlba ) images with a resolution of 1  mas ( 2  au at the source distance ) obtained during a full orbital cycle show an elongated structure that rotates as a function of the orbital phase @xcite .",
    "later vlba images show repeating structures at the same orbital phases , reinforcing the idea that the milliarcsecond structure depends on the orbital phase @xcite . this may be consistent with a model based on the interaction between the relativistic wind of a young non - accreting pulsar and the wind / decretion disk of the stellar companion @xcite , as occurs in psr  b1259@xmath563 ( but confining the pulsar wind may be problematic ; see @xcite )",
    ".    shows periodic non - thermal radio outbursts on average every @xmath6=26.4960@xmath20.0028  d , with the peak of the radio emission shifting progressively from phase 0.45 to 0.95 , using @xmath7=jd  2,443,366.775 , with a modulation period of 1667@xmath28  d @xcite . according to the most precise orbital parameters",
    ", the periastron takes place at phase 0.275 and the eccentricity of the orbit is @xmath8 @xcite .    has been observed several times in x - rays ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it generally displays quasi - periodic x - ray outbursts , with the maximum occurring between orbital phases 0.4 and 0.8 @xcite , although the lack of a sensitive long - term monitoring has prevented to search for a super - orbital modulation .",
    "the source also shows short - term variability on timescales of hours @xcite .    at vhe gamma rays ,",
    "has been clearly detected several times both by magic @xcite and veritas @xcite .",
    "the source also displays vhe gamma - ray periodicity , with minima taking place near periastron , where only upper limits were found in magic observations , and maxima occurring on average at phase 0.60.7 , although the source has also shown a second peak at phase 0.84 in one of the cycles @xcite .",
    "there are indications of correlated x - ray / vhe emission , based on non - simultaneous data taken more than 6  hr apart @xcite , and 1  d apart @xcite .",
    "the lack of a systematic behavior from cycle to cycle at x - ray and vhe bands , and the occurrence of short - term variability in the x - ray flux , has hampered the definitive detection of an x - ray / vhe correlation from the comparison of non - simultaneous data .",
    "we therefore conducted a multiwavelength campaign in 2007 september , covering the epoch of maximum vhe emission . here , we report the first simultaneous vhe and x - ray observations of  obtained with the magic cherenkov telescope and the _ xmm - newton _  and _ swift _  x - ray satellites that show correlated emission in both energy bands",
    ". we also briefly comment on radio and optical spectroscopic observations obtained during the campaign .",
    "the vhe gamma - ray observations were performed from 2007 september 4 to 21 using the magic telescope on the canary island of la palma ( @xmath9n , @xmath10w , 2225  m a.s.l . ) , from where  is observable at zenith angles above @xmath11 .",
    "the essential parameters of magic are a 17  m diameter segmented mirror of parabolic shape ( currently the largest dish for an air cherenkov telescope ) , an @xmath12 of 1.05 , and an hexagonally shaped camera of 576 hemispherical photo multiplier tubes with a field of view of @xmath13 diameter .",
    "magic can detect gamma rays from 60  gev to several tev , and with a special setup the trigger threshold can be reduced to 25  gev @xcite . its energy resolution is @xmath14% above energies of 200  gev .",
    "the current sensitivity is 1.6% of the crab nebula flux for a @xmath15 detection in 50  hr of on - source time .",
    "the improvement compared to the previous sensitivity was achieved by installing new 2  ghz fadcs @xcite .",
    "the total observation time was 58.8  hr , including 39.6  hr in dark conditions and 19.2  hr under moonlight or twilight @xcite .",

    "in addition to this established feature we measured , as in 2006 december , significant flux on a nightly basis at phase 0.85 .",
    "we note that there is significant flux in the phase range 0.81.0 at the level of @xmath127  @xmath23  s@xmath24 , which is compatible with the 2@xmath66 upper limit we obtained for the shorter 2006 observations @xcite .",

    "this implies that , for each observation , the flux and corresponding uncertainty obtained from the spectral fit is a good estimate of the flux during the whole observation . however , moderate count - rate variability on timescales of ks is present in most observations , ranging from 6% to 17% for the _ xmm - newton _  data and from 9% to 25% for the _ swift _  data ( see table  [ table : xray ] ) .",
    "the rms of this variability should be considered in addition to the statistical uncertainty when providing a flux measurement spanning several ks .",
    "we converted this count - rate variability into flux variability by multiplying the degree of variability defined in section  [ obs_xray ] with the fluxes coming from the spectral fits .",
    "since no spectral change is detected within each observation , we added this flux variability in quadrature to the spectral fits flux errors .",
    "this procedure provides the more realistic total flux uncertainties quoted in parentheses in table  [ table : xray ] , and used hereafter .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : lc ] ( bottom ) the 0.310  kev light curve of .",
    "the source displays a steady flux during the first four observations and shows a steep increase at phase 0.62 , which is followed by a slower decay up to phase 0.69 ( _ xmm - newton _ ) and probably up to phase 0.72 ( _ swift _ ) .",
    "the behavior is very similar to the one seen at vhe gamma rays , although at x - ray energies the baseline has a significant flux .",
    "later on there is a significant increase of the x - ray flux up to phase 0.8 .",
    "this high flux is detected with a sparse sampling up to phase 0.9 , and the source goes back to its baseline flux at phase 1.0 .",
    "this high x - ray flux between phases 0.8 and 1.0 occurs when the source is also detected at vhe gamma rays .",
    "a clear correlation between the x - ray and vhe gamma - ray emissions is seen during the outburst , with a simultaneous peak at phase 0.62 ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) . to study the significance of this correlation , we selected the x - ray data sets that overlap with magic observations .",
    "there are six overlapping magic/_xmm - newton _  data sets , for which strictly simultaneous observations range from 3.3 to 3.9  hr .",
    "for the four overlapping magic/_swift_data sets , the strictly simultaneous observations range from 2.2 to 4.1  hr ( although the _ swift _  runs have gaps ) .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : corr ] the x - ray fluxes against the vhe fluxes ( from tables  [ table : vhe ] and [ table : xray ] ) for all 10 simultaneous pairs , which are marked with arrows in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient for the six simultaneous magic/_xmm - newton _  pairs that trace the outburst is @xmath0 .",
    "for the ten simultaneous pairs , we find @xmath1 ( a @xmath129 larger than that has a probability of about @xmath130 to be produced from independent x - ray and vhe fluxes ) .",
    "minimizing @xmath63 we obtain @xmath131 for 8 degrees of freedom and the following relationship : @xmath132(0.310  kev)/[10@xmath22  erg  @xmath23  s@xmath133=(12.2^{+0.9}_{-1.0})+(0.71^{+0.17}_{-0.14})\\times n$](@xmath134300  gev)/[10@xmath22  @xmath23  s@xmath133 $ ] ( non - gaussian uncertainties ) .",
    "this fit is plotted as a solid line in figure  [ fig : corr ] .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : corr ] , the flux uncertainties are relatively large . this calls for a test of the reliability of the correlation strength considering the errors of individual data points . to this end",
    ", we use the @xmath135-transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) , which determines 68% confidence level intervals for the correlation coefficient from unevenly sampled data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fisher @xmath135-transform of the linear correlation coefficient is used to estimate the 68% confidence level interval . applying the zdcf to the x - ray and vhe light curves reported here",
    "we obtain the following uncertainties for the linear correlation coefficient : @xmath136 .",
    "the sensitivity of the magic telescope requires observation times of several hours to be able to get few - sigma detections for the vhe fluxes from . during such long periods , the x - ray fluxes have quite large intrinsic variability ( see table  [ table : xray ] ) .",
    "this results in quite large uncertainties on both the vhe and x - ray fluxes that restrict the ability to determine a possible correlation out of the outburst .",
    "we have discovered an x - ray / vhe gamma - ray correlation in the gamma - ray binary  based on simultaneous multiwavelength data obtained with magic , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _  during a single orbital cycle .",
    "the correlation is mainly due to the very similar trends of the detected flux during the outburst around orbital phase 0.62 , while the uncertainties prevent to be sure about the existence of the correlation outside the outburst .",
    "given the variability in the x - ray flux ( up to 25% on hour scales ) , it is necessary to program simultaneous observations to perform correlation studies in .",
    "this conclusion has also been reached recently by the veritas collaboration , when reporting the lack of x - ray / vhe correlation based on contemporaneous data with a vhe sampling that is not dense enough @xcite .",
    "although a similar x - ray / vhe correlation has been obtained for the vhe gamma - ray emitting x - ray binary , this result was based on non - simultaneous data acquired years apart @xcite .",
    "the vhe emission within a binary system can suffer photon ",
    "photon absorption via pair creation , mainly with the stellar optical / ultraviolet photons . in , this absorption",
    "is only expected to be significant toward the observer for @xmath137  gev just before periastron @xcite , a phase range not explored here .",
    "in addition , the quoted x - ray fluxes are already de - absorbed ( and the hydrogen column densities and the associated errors are low ) .",
    "overall , there are no absorption effects to be considered .",
    "therefore , the x - ray / vhe correlation we have found for  can not be an artifact due to variable absorption toward the source .",
    "this indicates that the emission processes at both wavelengths occur at the same time and are probably the result of a single physical mechanism . in this context , it is reasonable to assume that the x - ray and vhe emissions are produced by a single particle population .",
    "it is interesting to note that the magic spectrum in the 0.60.7 phase range yields @xmath138  erg  @xmath23  s@xmath24 for @xmath137  gev , while the x - ray flux is @xmath139  erg  @xmath23  s@xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the total x - ray flux is approximately twice the vhe flux .",
    "however , if we subtract an apparent baseline x - ray flux of @xmath140  erg  @xmath23  s@xmath24 , the resulting x - ray flux is similar to the total vhe flux in the phase range 0.60.7 . if the radiation mechanisms are dominated by a single particle population , the x - ray / vhe correlation and the smaller / similar vhe fluxes favor leptonic models . in hadronic models ,",
    "the x - ray emitting @xmath141 and the vhe photons would come from the same protons ( for reasonable values of the magnetic field ) , and the luminosity of the @xmath141 radiation should be @xmath142 that of vhe gamma - rays ( see figure  5 of @xcite for reasonable proton energy distributions ) unlike it is observed .",
    "in addition , the inverse compton ( ic ) cooling channel is less efficient than the synchrotron channel to produce the detected x - ray emission for reasonable values of the magnetic field ( see @xcite for a similar discussion for ) .",
    "this clearly suggests that the x rays are the result of synchrotron radiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result of ic scattering of optical / ultraviolet stellar photons .",
    "the observed photon indices of the simultaneous x - ray and vhe spectra are consistent with one population of electrons following a power - law energy distribution with index @xmath42.1 .",
    "these electrons would produce x - rays via synchrotron and vhe photons via ic with an interaction angle @xmath143 .",
    "we note that an electron index of @xmath42.1 is too hard if synchrotron cooling dominates in the x - ray range , since it implies an injected electron index of 1.1 . on the other hand ,",
    "dominant adiabatic cooling implies an injection index of 2.1 , a more reasonable value ( see , for example , the discussion in @xcite ) . although small changes in the vhe spectrum would be expected due to variations in the ic interaction angle or the electron index ( as seen in x - rays ) , at present they are not detectable due to the large uncertainties of the vhe photon index .",
    "finally , we note that contemporaneous radio light curves obtained with ratan , vlba images , and h@xmath144 spectroscopy are consistent with previous results @xcite .",
    "details on these observations will be reported elsewhere .",
    "therefore , the x - ray / vhe correlation occurred when the source was showing a standard behavior in both its outflow ( radio ) and decretion disk ( h@xmath144 line ) .",

    "<S> the discovery of very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray emitting x - ray binaries has triggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration , absorption , and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems , which provide variable conditions along eccentric orbits . despite this </S>",
    "<S> , the nature of some of these systems , and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission , is unclear . </S>",
    "<S> to answer some of these open questions , we conducted a multiwavelength campaign of the vhe gamma - ray emitting x - ray binary  including the magic telescope , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _  during 60% of an orbit in 2007 september . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a simultaneous outburst at x - ray and vhe bands , with the peak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> a linear fit to the simultaneous x - ray / vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlation coefficient of @xmath0 , while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs provides @xmath1 . since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer </S>",
    "<S> is not expected for the data reported here , the correlation found indicates a simultaneity in the emission processes . assuming that they are dominated by a single particle population , either hadronic or leptonic , the x - ray / vhe flux ratio favors leptonic models . </S>",
    "<S> this fact , together with the detected photon indices , suggests that in  the x - rays are the result of synchrotron radiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result of inverse compton scattering of stellar photons . </S>"
