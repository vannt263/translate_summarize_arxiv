    "@xcite on the near - resonant spectra of a single @xmath0rb atom localized in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) optical lattice .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec.2 the formula for the 3d optical lattice in a phase - stabilized magneto - optical trap ( mot )",
    "is derived . in sec.3",
    "the data analysis details for the spectral lineshape fitting are given . in sec.4",
    "supplementary data on many - atom spectra with a fixed depletion rate to the inaccessible @xmath1 hyperfine level are presented .",
    "a three - dimensional optical lattice can be established in a phase - stabilized mot .",
    "phase stabilization can be done by passive means , _",
    "i.e. _ , by making a standing wave formed by a trap laser intersect with itself at right angle twice by folding it @xcite as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in this configuration ,",
    "the electric fields of the trap laser can be expressed as follows , assuming a unit amplitude for each field , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are unit vectors parallel to the propagation directions of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the phase factors for @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "since each beam path is not independent from the others , there exists some constraints on the phase factors .",
    "the mathematical form for the total electric field in the intersection region is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the path lengths depicted as thick colored lines in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "note that the total time phase @xmath16 term is common , thus the interference pattern is insensitive to time - phase jittering although the whole pattern may slowly shift due to the fluctuating phase factors or path lengths @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the light shift potential due to interference pattern of the standing waves , corresponding to the optical - lattice potential structure in fig.1(a ) of ref.@xcite , can then be calculated as @xmath17",
    "in ref.@xcite we trapped a single rubidium atom in the optical lattice in a phase - stabilized mot and measured its near - resonant spectra for various micro - potential depths of the optical lattice . the full - width - at - half - maximum of the central rayleigh peak",
    "was then plotted as a function of the micro - potential depth in fig.4 there .",
    "the fit curve in fig.4 of ref.@xcite was obtained as follows . for a given oscillation frequency @xmath18 of the micropotential",
    ", the observed lineshape of the rayleigh peak is fit by the following convolution integrals .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the population in the ground ( excited ) vibrational level including a degeneracy factor ( 1 for the ground and 2 for the excited level ) and @xmath21 is the rayleigh scattering cross section of the ground ( excited ) vibrational levels .",
    "lineshape @xmath22 is given by a voigt integral ( with respect to a resonance frequency ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a lorentzian given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a gaussian given by @xmath27 parameter @xmath28 is given by a sum of @xmath29 the @xmath30-state bandwidth due to tunneling ( given by the band calculation of ref.@xcite ) and @xmath31 the depletion - induced broadening of the excited electronic state ( independently measured ) .",
    "parameter @xmath32 is given by the square root of the sum of squares of @xmath33 , the spectral resolution of our system ( given by experiment ) , and @xmath34 , a small inhomogeneous broadening , which is a fitting parameter .",
    "lineshape @xmath35 is similarly defined with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the @xmath39-state bandwidth due to tunneling and @xmath40 , another fitting parameter , is the inhomogeneous broadening associated with the excited vibrational level .",
    "the populations are determined by the temperature of the atoms @xcite .",
    "the temperature increases as the potential depth increases because the atomic momentum diffusion is proportional to the trap laser power @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed this relation in our experiment . for the range of trap depth covered in our experiment ,",
    "the temperature varied from 3 @xmath41k to 6 @xmath41k as shown in fig.[fig3](a ) .",
    "however , the boltzmann factor @xmath42 , which determines the population ratio @xmath43 , remains almost constant , so @xmath44 as shown in fig.[fig3](b ) .",
    "since the rayleigh scattering cross section is proportional to @xmath45 for @xmath46th vibrational level , @xmath47 @xcite , we then obtain @xmath48 .     versus the oscillation frequency.,width=326 ]",
    "there are two fitting parameters @xmath34 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , we obtain @xmath49 khz within the fitting uncertainty for all @xmath18 in fig.4 of ref.@xcite . the full - width - at - half - maximum of the resulting lineshape curve of eq.(2 ) as a function of @xmath18 is our final fit curve in fig.4 of ref.@xcite .",
    "it well reproduces the trend of the rayleigh - peak linewidth at small @xmath18 .",
    "in order to isolate the tunneling effect in the rayleigh - peak linewidth , we have also measured the spectra for various trap depths or the oscillation frequency @xmath18 while keeping the depletion rate into the inaccessible @xmath1 hyperfine levels @xcite almost constant .",
    "note that the depletion rate is proportional to the population of the excited electronic states whereas the potential depth is proportional the light shift of the ground electronic state .",
    "we carefully selected sets of mot parameters producing the same depletion rate but different trap depths or different @xmath18 .",
    "the experimental results obtained with hundreds of atoms are shown in fig.[fig2 ] . as mentioned in ref.@xcite",
    ", we could not perform the same experiment for a single atom for the given range of @xmath18 because the signal level became too low for small and large @xmath18 .        in our analysis",
    "the observed rayleigh peak was fit by eq.(2 ) , but this time with three fitting parameters : @xmath34 , @xmath40 and @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is kept constant for all oscillation frequencies since the population of the excited electronic states were kept almost constant in our experiment as shown in fig.[fig2](b ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath50 khz and @xmath51 khz as in the single - atom experiment , but @xmath52 khz , 22% larger than that in the single - atom case , indicating additional broadening due to many atoms .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that the linewidth decreases as the oscillation frequency increases in fig.[fig2 ] , confirming the dependence of the tunneling effect on the oscillation frequency .",
