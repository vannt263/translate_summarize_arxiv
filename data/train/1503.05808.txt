    "x - ray spectra from stellar mass black hole ( bh ) binaries are known to transit between the high / soft state ( hss ) and low / hard state ( lhs ) , in accordance with the mass accretion rate . the hss spectrum is mainly composed of a bright thermal component that dominates the soft x - ray band accompanied by a less bight power law ( pl ) component that exhibits a `` hard tail '' in the @xmath410 kev band .",
    "the thermal component is well reproduced by a multi - color disk ( mcd ; @xcite ; @xcite ) emission from an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk described by the standard disk model ( @xcite ) . from the fact that the inner radius of the accretion disk derived from the mcd model is constant ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , which is determined by the bh mass and spin , has been established ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the hard - tail component seen in the hss is thought to be produced by compton upscattering of the mcd photons by energetic electrons .",
    "this implies a situation similar to the one that produces the dominant hard x - ray continuum in the lhs , which is understood as resulting from thermal comptonization of the disk photons by hot thermal electron clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , these two phenomena show considerable differences . the hard tail in the hss is expressed by a single pl with a photon index of @xmath5@xmath6 , and often extends to @xmath7 mev , in contrast to the lhs continuum which is flatter ( @xmath8 ) with",
    "clear a cut - off at @xmath9 kev . as a result",
    ", the hss hard tail can be explained either by non - thermal comptonization , or by a hybrid of non - thermal and thermal comptonization processes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "overall , the hard - tail phenomenon is much less well understood than the soft component .",
    "when a bhb ( particularly a transient one ) evolves from the lhs into the hss , it often passes through another spectral state , called the very high state ( vhs ; e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the vhs spectrum is characterized by luminous disk emissions with a strong pl hard tail with a steep slope of @xmath10 2.4 .",
    "the latter is resolved to two hard - tail , and explained by non - thermal plus thermal combined comptonization ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , of which the thermal fraction is thought to decrease as the system approaches the hss from the vhs .",
    "this state evolution is also thought to involve changes in the optically - thick disk , which extends down to isco in the hss ( as described above ) but while is likely to be truncated in the lhs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the vhs is thus understood as a transient stage in which the innermost disk radius gradually decreases and approaches the isco .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", the optically - thick disk and the comptonizing clouds are suspected to be coupled to each other through the state transition . in the present paper",
    ", we examine possible relationships between the disk and the compton - clouds in bhbs by examining a vhs that is rather close to the hss .",
    "this objective requires broadband coverage from @xmath7 to @xmath9 kev , for which _ suzaku _ is ideal .",
    "lmc x-1 is a persistently x - ray luminous bh binary that is accompanied by an o type star with an estimated mass of 32 @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the solar mass .",
    "the binary parameters are known with good accuracy : bh mass @xmath12 , inclination angle @xmath13 , and distance @xmath14 kpc ( @xcite ) . for decades , it has been found in the hss or vhs , with relatively high luminosity of @xmath010% of the eddington value .",
    "previous observations have reported a variable inner disk radius and a steep hard - tail slope of @xmath15 , which are both suggestive of the vhs .",
    "this , together with its strong x - ray variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , makes the object a good source for our study . in previous studies of lmc x-1 in energy bands below 20 kev ,",
    "the hard tail was in most cases reproduced by a simple pl feature with reflection ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed clear evidence for an iron line in the time - averaged _ suzaku _ spectrum , and a positive correlation between the iron line flux and compton scattering fraction obtained from rxte observations .",
    "although those results suggest that the comptonized hard - tail photons are illuminating the disk to produce the iron line photons , that study considered neither combined comptonization nor studied spectral variations in the _ suzaku _ data . in the present paper ,",
    "we hence reanalyze the same _ suzaku _ observation data , attempting to see whether the inner disk radius remained constant , and whether the hard tail exhibited the signature of combined comptonization .",
    "_ suzaku _ , which is the fifth japanese x - ray satellite ( @xcite ) , carries onboard the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the xis consists of four charge - coupled device cameras placed at the focus of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) , covering the 0.212 kev energy range . however , one of four units is not operational ( suzaku - memo 2007 - 08 ) . of the three available xis units ,",
    "two ( xis-0 and xis-3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) while the other ( xis-1 ) is back - illuminated ( bi ) .",
    "the hxd consists of pin silicon diodes ( hxd - pin ; 1070 kev ) and gd@xmath16sio@xmath17ce scintillators ( gso ; 50600 kev ) . in 2009 from july 21 ut 18:38 to july 24 21:29 , _ suzaku _ observed the source at `` xis nominal '' pointing position .",
    "the xis was operated in standard clocking mode and `` 1/4 window '' option in order to attain a time resolution of 2 s.    we used data product from _ suzaku _ pipeline processing version 2.4.12.26 with calibration version hxd20090511 , xis20090402 and xrt20080709 , and software version headas 6.6.2 .",
    "xis and hxd events were screened by standard criteria .",
    "we discarded events collected with earth elevation below 5@xmath18 , or with the sun irradiated - earth elevation below 20@xmath18 ( for xis ) , or when the spacecraft was in an orbit phase within 436 s after ( for xis ) or 180 s before and 500 s after ( for hxd ) the south atlantic anomaly ingress / egress , or at low - cutoff rigidity regions below 6 gv .",
    "we accepted only the xis events with standard grades ( 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 ) in the analysis .",
    "xis spectra and light curves were extracted from a rectangle region of @xmath19 , attained in the 1/4 window area and centered on the image peak , while the background was also obtained from a source - free region in the same 1/4 window area .",
    "furthermore , we excluded a circular region of around the image peak . according to the software aepileupcheckup ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the remaining signals are evaluated to have a pileup fraction of @xmath201% .",
    "the net averaged xiss count rates were @xmath015 counts s@xmath21 in the exposure time of @xmath0 110 ks for each sensor .",
    "the xis redistribution matrix files were calculated using the xisrmfgen tool and the ancillary response files were simulated by the xissimarfgen tool ( @xcite ) .",
    "the xis1 unfolded data deviate systematically , at energies of @xmath22 kev , from those of xis0 and xis3 .",
    "this is presumably due to the residual calibration uncertainties of xis1 ( @xcite , subsection 7.3.3 of suzaku technical description ) .",
    "therefore we did not use the xis1 data in the following analysis .",
    "the hxd screened events were used to obtain spectra and light curves from the pin and gso sensors .",
    "the net exposure of each sensor was 124 ks after dead - time correction .",
    "the dead - time fractions were 6.8 % averaged for both pin and gso sensors .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background was modeled assuming an exponentially cutoff pl model ( @xcite ) .",
    "non - x - ray background ( nxb ) models were provided by the hxd team ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the model with method=``lcfitdt(bgd_d ) '' , together with the version of methodv=``2.0ver0804 '' and `` 2.4ver0912 - 64 '' for the data from the pin and gso sensors , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_detect ] shows the background - subtracted spectra .",
    "events are significantly detected by the pin sensor up to 50 kev , which is above the systematic uncertainty in the nxb model ( 3% for pin ) .",
    "in addition to lmc x-1 , there were three hard x - ray sources in the pin field of view ( fov ; @xmath19 ) ; psr b0540@xmath2369.3 , sn 1987a and rx j0541.4@xmath236936 .",
    "although the expected 20100 kev flux of psr b0540@xmath2369.3 , @xmath24 ( @xcite ) , is comparable to the observed pin flux of @xmath25 ( modeled with a single pl ) , it is separated from lmc x-1 by .",
    "the pin fov during the present observation is evaluated to have a transmission efficiency of 21% .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis , the spectral contribution from this active pulsar was modeled by a pl with @xmath26=2.12 ( @xcite ) , but with the flux reduced to 21% of that reported . in the light curve analysis",
    ", we subtracted the constant count rate of 1.21@xmath1910@xmath27 counts s@xmath1 in 1350 kev , which estimated by pimms tool , from the pin light curve .",
    "the hard x - ray spectra of sn 1987a and rx j0541.4@xmath236936 were cutoff - pl with @xmath26=1.7 , cut - off energy of @xmath28=100 kev and flux of @xmath29 @xmath30 , and @xmath26=1.0 , @xmath28=15 kev and the flux of @xmath31 , respectively , as taken from the @xmath32 source catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "their locations are off - axis to the pin fov , and the pin efficiency was @xmath2050% of the peak value .",
    "the contributions of these two sources are thus an order of magnitude below the pin flux and hence negligible . because the gso fov contained too many contaminating sources to individually evaluate",
    ", we do not use the gso data in this paper .",
    "using the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec version 12.8.2 and employing the solar abundance tabulated in @xcite , we analyzed 0.810 kev xis spectra and 1350 kev hxd - pin spectra , averaged over the entire exposure .",
    "the energy bands of 1.62.0 kev and 2.22.4 kev were excluded to avoid relatively large systematic instrumental uncertainties near the silicon k edge ( 1.74 kev and 1.84 kev for k@xmath33 and k@xmath34 , respectively ) and the gold m edge ( 2.29 kev ) , respectively .",
    "the remaining instrumental feature at @xmath0 3.2 kev by the gold m edge was modeled by a gaussian line with a fixed width of @xmath35 = 0.1 kev ( ref .",
    "we used a combination of xis0 and xis3 after co - adding them together , and we added a 1% systematic uncertainty to all xis energy channels .",
    "we extended the energy range of spectral fitting to 0.11000 kev , as used in some convolution models .",
    "we fitted the xis and pin spectra simultaneously with a cross normalization factor of 1.16 between xis and pin ( suzaku - memo-2008 - 06 ) .",
    "we assumed the situation where part of the mcd photons are compton - upscattered to the hard tail , and with reflection of comptonized emissions .",
    "we utilize a convolution model simpl which takes some fraction of the disk seed photons and upscatters these to higher energy ( @xcite ) . in order to account for the reflection of the comptonization continuum from ionized material ,",
    "we employed the rfxconv model ( @xcite ) which is a convolution model and calculates reflection continuum and fluorescence based on the tables of @xcite .",
    "we fixed the ionized parameter @xmath361000 erg cm s@xmath1 , inclination angle of @xmath37=36.38(@xcite ) and assumed solar abundances . using kdblur ( @xcite )",
    "the reflected spectrum is smeared by general relativistic effects , with fixed inner and outer disk radii of @xmath38 ( @xcite ) and @xmath39 , inclination angle @xmath40 , and emissivity index @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the mass of the central bh ) .",
    "the output of simpl*diskbb is the mcd component reduced by comptonization and upscattered emissions . to calculate the reflection of the compton component",
    ", we divided the simpl into simpl@xmath44 and simpl@xmath45 for reduced mcd and comptonization emission , respectively .",
    "consequently , we employed the continuum model as expressed by ( simpl@xmath44 + kdblur*rfxconv*simpl@xmath45)*diskbb modified by photoelectric absorption ( phabs in xspec ) as model 1 .",

    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table [ tab : avr_rfxcomv_simpl_dbborbhspec ] as model 1 .",
    "this fit is unacceptable , with @xmath46 = 290.13/118 , and we see large residuals below 3 kev and above 20 kev . to check that the assumption of @xmath47 erg cm s@xmath1 does not affect the result , we set @xmath48 to be free . this did not resolve the problem , with results of @xmath46 = 216.84/117 , where @xmath48 = @xmath49 erg cm s@xmath1 and reflection strength of @xmath50 = @xmath51 , which is too large to be physically compatible .    to introduce a physical explanation for the excess in the 510 kev band , we replaced the diskbb model by bhspec model ( @xcite ) ( model 2 ) to account for relativity .",

    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table [ tab : avr_rfxcomv_simpl_dbborbhspec ] as model 2 .",
    "the fit is still unacceptable with @xmath46 = 302.24/118 .",
    "as shown by the black and red lines in figure [ fig : spec_avr_rfxconv_dbborbhspec ] ( d ) , the application of relativistic effects makes the disk component slightly broader but the difference is compensated for by increased photoelectric absorption .",
    "we tested the fit again by allowing @xmath48 to be free , and derived @xmath46 = 245.15/117 , where @xmath48 = @xmath52 erg cm s@xmath1and @xmath50 = @xmath53 .",
    "to provide an alternative picture , we introduce a combined hard and soft comptonization model . for the soft comptonization process",
    ", we employed a dkbbfth model ( @xcite ) , which calculates comptonized mcd spectrum from the accretion disk and the thermal plasma covering the inner region at @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are inner disk radius and outer radius of the thermal comptonizing cloud .",
    "the model parameters are temperature of seed mcd , electron temperature @xmath57 , photon index @xmath58 , @xmath56 , and normalization .",
    "we again include the simpl model for hard comptonization with fixed @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that hard comptonization occurs independently of soft comptonization ( i.e. , hard electrons do not scatter soft comptonized photons ) and assume the same reflection process for both components .",
    "this thus gives a continuum model expressed by phabs * [ simpl@xmath60 * dkbbfth@xmath61 + kdblur * rfxconv * ( simpl@xmath62 * dkbbfth@xmath61 + dkbbfth@xmath63 ) ] ( model 3 ) , where the subscripts of hc and sc denote the hard and soft compton component , respectively .    the fitting result with the third model is shown in figure [ fig : spec_avr_rfxconv_dbborbhspec ] ( c ) and table [ tab : avr_rfxcomv_simpl_dbborbhspec ] as model 3 .",
    "the reduced @xmath64 is acceptable with 111.57/116 .",
    "equation 1 of @xcite gives the relationship between @xmath65 , @xmath66 and optical depth assuming a source of slab geometry with seed photons at the bottom of the slab : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and the optical depth is approximately half that of spherical geometry ( see also @xcite ) . using this equation , the optical depth",
    "is calculated to be @xmath69 = @xmath70 . since the normalization of dkbbfth is not equivalent to that of diskbb , we calculated the inner disk radius @xmath71 via equation a.1 in @xcite using the unabsorbed photon flux .",
    "we derived @xmath72 which is consistent with the estimation from model 1 .",
    "this implies that the soft compton cloud localized within @xmath73 scatters 12% of disk photons .    as show in figure [ fig : spec_avr_rfxconv_dbborbhspec ] ( d ) , the inclusion of the soft comptonized emission shifts the disk component to lower temperature , which makes derived @xmath71 larger substantially .",

    "<S> this double compton component model allows a slightly larger inner radius of the multi - color disk , implying lower spin parameter . </S>",
    "<S> significant spectral evolution was observed above 8 kev along with a flux decrease on a timescale of @xmath010@xmath210@xmath3 s. by spectral fitting , we show that this behavior is well explained by changes in the hard comptonized emission component in contrast to the maintained disk and soft comptonized emission . </S>"
