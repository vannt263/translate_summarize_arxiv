    "the traditional notion of a simple liquid  involving point - like particles interacting via radially symmetric pair potentials@xcite ( for example the lennard - jones ( lj ) system)is challenged by the existence of examples like the gaussian core model,@xcite and the lennard - jones gaussian model@xcite which exhibit complex behavior .",
    "moreover many molecular models have simple behavior in computer simulations , and experiments on van der waals liquids show that these are generally regular with no anomalous behavior .",
    "we have recently suggested redefining a simple liquid  termed now a roskilde - simple liquid , or just a roskilde liquid  as one with strong correlations between the equilibrium virial ( @xmath5 ) and potential - energy ( @xmath6 ) fluctuations in the canonical fixed - volume ( nvt ) ensemble.@xcite the basic phenomenology and theoretical understanding of roskilde liquids were presented in a series of five papers published in the journal of chemical physics .",
    "@xcite in particular , appendix a of ref .   established an essential theorem of roskilde liquids : a system has strong @xmath7 correlations if and only if it has good isomorphs ( curves in the thermodynamic phase diagram along which a number of properties are invariant in reduced units @xcite ) .",
    "the degree of simplicity depends on the thermodynamic state point ",
    "all realistic systems lose simplicity when approaching the critical point and gas states . to illustrate this ,",
    "figure  [ rcontours ] shows the lennard - jones diagram including contours of the correlation coefficient @xmath4 between @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "we choose an ( arbitrary ) cut - off @xmath8 as the boundary of simple - liquid behavior .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the correlation coefficient decreases rapidly as the liquid - gas spinodal is approached .",
    "the theory of isomorphs starts with their definition and derives consequences from this which can be tested in simulations . for a system with @xmath9 particles , two density - temperature state points @xmath10 and @xmath11 are isomorphic to each other",
    "if the boltzmann factors for corresponding configurational microstates are proportional :    @xmath12    here @xmath6 is the potential energy function and @xmath13 depends on the two state points , but not on which microstates are considered .",
    "corresponding microstates means @xmath14 , or @xmath15 , where a tilde denotes so - called reduced units .",
    "reduced units for lengths means multiplying by @xmath16 , for energies dividing by @xmath17 , and for times dividing by @xmath18 ( for newtonian dynamics ) .",
    "an isomorph is a curve in the phase diagram of points which are isomorphic to each other . from the definition it follows that all structural and dynamical correlation functions are isomorph invariant when expressed in reduced units .",
    "thermodynamic quantities which do not involve volume derivatives , such as the excess entropy @xmath1 and excess specific heat at constant volume @xmath19 , are also isomorph invariant .",
    "another consequence of the isomorph definition is that phase boundaries lying within the simple region of the phase diagram are isomorphs  note that the isomorph shown in fig .",
    "[ rcontours ] is nearly parallel to the liquid - solid coexistence lines .",
    "reference   gives a brief review of the theory and its experimentally relevant consequences .    only inverse power - law ( ipl ) systems , i.e. , systems for which the potential energy is an euler homogeneous function , have 100% virial potential - energy correlation and perfect isomorphs .",
    "thus for realistic roskilde liquids the isomorph concept is only approximate .",
    "extensive computer simulations have shown , however , that the predicted isomorph invariants apply to a good approximation for several systems .",
    "@xcite a few predictions have also been confirmed experimentally.@xcite    despite the success of the isomorph concept , it remains a `` zero - order '' theory , analogous to the ideal gas .",
    "in particular there is so systematic theory for describing realistic systems in terms of perturbations about the ideal case .",
    "the purpose of this work is to examine deviations from perfect isomorph behavior in roskilde liquids .",
    "one motivation is to understand what kind of deviations from ipl behavior ( for example constancy of the scaling exponent ) are allowed while remaining in the `` simple part '' of the phase diagram .",
    "a second motivation is the hope of using roskilde liquids to identify a general theory of liquids .",
    "for example , the existence of good isomorphs explains many observed connections between dynamics , structure and thermodynamics , but also means that cause - and - effect interpretations of such connections ( `` the dynamics is _ controlled _ by  '' ) must be re - examined",
    ". given perfect isomorphs , any isomorph - invariant quantity can be said to control all the others .",
    "this puts a constraint on general theories , referred to as the `` isomorph filter'',@xcite but prevents one from sorting among theories that pass the filter . examining carefully whether dynamical properties are more invariant when holding one isomorph - invariant quantity fixed versus holding another fixed could provide a means to select theories .",
    "strong @xmath7 correlation in the equilibrium nvt ensemble is a hallmark , and the first identified feature,@xcite of roskilde liquids .",
    "it is characterized at the level of second moments by the correlation coefficient    @xmath20    and the slope    @xmath21    here @xmath22 represents the deviation of a quantity from its nvt ensemble average .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath2 may be thought of in terms of an effective inverse power - law ( ipl ) potential with exponent 3@xmath2 ( which in general depends on state point).@xcite it has also a thermodynamic interpretation , namely it is the ratio of the excess pressure coefficient @xmath23 and excess specific heat per unit volume ,    @xmath24    as mentioned , in ipl systems the correlation is indeed perfect , but non - ipl systems exist which yet have strong @xmath7-correlations , in particular the usual lj fluid . while in any system",
    "the fluctuation formula for @xmath2 can be used to generate curves of constant ( excess ) entropy @xmath1 ( configurational adiabats ) via@xcite    @xmath25    in roskilde - simple liquids several properties related to structure , thermodynamics , and dynamics are invariant along these curves .",
    "this leads to their designation as `` isomorphs '' ; note that quantities must be expressed in thermodynamically reduced units to exhibit the invariance .",
    "@xcite one of the most basic isomorph - invariant quantities is the specific heat at constant volume : perfect isomorphs are also @xmath0-contours , while in imperfectly correlating systems the @xmath0 contours and configurational adiabats may differ .    one might expect that the closer @xmath4 is to unity , the better approximated the system would be by a single ipl potential .",
    "so it is perhaps surprising that we have recently identified systems where @xmath2 changes much more than in the lj case , over a range in which strong @xmath7-correlation ( @xmath8 ) is maintained .",
    "one such system is the `` repulsive lennard - jones '' potential , in which the sign of the @xmath26 term is made positive.@xcite it seems that the property of strong @xmath7 correlation , and the existence of isomorphs are somehow more robust than the constancy of @xmath2",
    ". it can be surprising how well isomorphs `` work '' for non - ipl systems .",
    "this robustness allows for a richer variety of behavior , since the shapes of isomorphs are no longer necessarily straight lines in a @xmath27-plot .",
    "the theory of the thermodynamics of roskilde - simple liquids @xcite implies that @xmath2 may be considered a function of @xmath28 only .",
    "this immediately gives us a new quantity ( in addition to @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) to characterize roskilde liquids : @xmath3 , or more simply , its sign .",
    "this result depends on the assumption that configurational adiabats and @xmath0-contours exactly coincide .",
    "it is not clear",
    "what to expect when this does not hold exactly ; this paper is an attempt to address the topic of imperfect correlation from statistical mechanical considerations . because @xmath0 is also a fundamental thermodynamic quantity , the difference between adiabats and @xmath0-contours should be a useful probe of the breakdown of perfect isomorphs as @xmath7-correlation becomes less than perfect , and will be the focus of this paper .    while as mentioned above , the arguments of ref .",
    "( which assume perfect isomorphs ) show that @xmath29 , in practice @xmath2 does depend on @xmath30 but the dependence is much smaller than that on @xmath28 , and we can ignore it most of the time .",
    "this is apparent for the single - component lj system in fig .",
    "5 of ref .  .",
    "a more explicit quantitative comparison , of the logarithmic derivatives of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath30 , was made in ref .",
    "for two molecular systems .",
    "we present further data on this below .",
    "fluids with lj and similar potentials ( for example generalized - lj potentials with different exponents ) tend to have @xmath31 : it is clear that @xmath2 must converge to one third of the repulsive exponent at very high densities and temperatures while typical values are larger.@xcite on the other hand potentials may be constructed which have @xmath32 , simply by shifting the potential radially outwards so that the repulsive divergence occurs at a finite value of pair separation .",
    "such potentials naturally involve a hard core of absolutely excluded volume .",
    "they are relevant to experiments,@xcite because tests of the isomorph theory@xcite typically involve molecules rather than single atoms , with the interaction range being relatively short compared to the particle size ( colloids are of an even more extreme example of this , of course ) .",
    "the dzugutov system,@xcite although only roskilde - simple at high densities and temperatures , is another example with @xmath32 , but where there is no hard core .",
    "another such system is the above - mentioned repulsive lennard - jones potential ; in this case the effective exponent increases monotonically , interpolating between the low density limit 6 ( @xmath33 ) and the high density limit 12 ( @xmath34 ) .    for brevity",
    "we term curves of constant @xmath1 _ adiabats _ ( the qualifier `` configurational '' is to be understood ) ; in this paper , unlike all our other works on isomorphs , we deliberately avoid calling them isomorphs , since the point of this work is to examine deviations from perfect isomorph behavior .",
    "we also drop the subscript @xmath35 for notational simplicity , and similarly use @xmath0 to mean the configurational part of specific heat ( the kinetic part is also isomorph invariant , though , being 3/2 for a classical monatomic system ) .",
    "below we derive some exact results concerning the relation between adiabats and @xmath0-contours , and argue how this connects to whether @xmath2 is an increasing or decreasing function of @xmath28 ( more specifically the sign of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the argument involves relating @xmath2 to an exponent determined by derivatives of the pair potential , introduced in ref .  .",
    "the claim is supported by simulations of two roskilde liquids : the lj fluid ( with @xmath37 ) and the girifalco fluid ( with @xmath38 at least for high densities ) .",
    "the girifalco potential was constructed to model the c@xmath39 molecules as spheres containing a uniform density of lennard - jones particles on their surface .",
    "rotationally averaging gives the following c@xmath39-c@xmath39 pair interaction@xcite    @xmath40    we have chosen the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that the potential well has a depth of approximately 1 and the potential diverges at unit distance , @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "for simulations we use systems of 1000 particles simulated at constant volume and temperature ( nvt ) using the rumd code@xcite for simulating on nvidia graphical processing units ( gpus ) .",
    "although the state points considered do not involve long relaxation times , the speed provided by gpus is desirable because reasonably accurate determination of third moments requires of order one million independent samples ; we typically run 50 million steps and sample every 50 steps ( the time step sizes were 0.0025 - 0.004 for lj and 0.0004 for girifalco ) .",
    "the temperature was controlled using a nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "part ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ potentials_n2 ] shows the correlation coefficient @xmath4 along an adiabat for each system .",
    "both systems are roskilde - simple ( have @xmath8 ) in the simulated part of the phase diagram .    in section  [ thermo_derivs ] a general fluctuation formula for derivatives of thermodynamic quantities along adiabats",
    "is derived , and applied to the case of @xmath45 in section  [ sign_dcv_sign_dgamma ] we show the connection between the derivative of @xmath0 and derivatives of @xmath2 .",
    "the results are illustrated with data from simulations . in section  [ fluc_cv_contours ] a fluctuation formula for the slope of contours of @xmath0",
    "is derived , and illustrated with simulation data .",
    "the final two sections are the discussion and a brief conclusion .",
    "before proceeding to thermodynamic derivatives we recall the connection between the above definition of @xmath2 and linear regression . following appendix c of ref .",
    "we characterize the deviation from perfect correlation via the fluctuating variable @xmath46 which vanishes for perfect correlation .",
    "the linear regression slope is defined by minimizing @xmath47 with respect to @xmath2 , leading to eq .",
    ".@xcite a consequence of this definition of @xmath2 is seen by writing    @xmath48    and correlating this with @xmath49 :    @xmath50    from this and the definition of @xmath2 it follows that    @xmath51    that is , @xmath6 and @xmath52 are ( linearly ) uncorrelated , independent of whether perfect correlation holds between @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "we are interested in the derivatives of thermodynamic quantities along certain curves in the phase diagram , in particular those of constant @xmath53 , so we start by presenting general formulas for the derivatives with respect to @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( holding the other constant ) . from standard statistical mechanics ( see , for example , appendix b of ref .  )",
    "we have ( with @xmath56 ; in the following we set @xmath57 )    @xmath58    which implies    @xmath59    likewise ( see appendix [ da_d_ln_rho_deriv ] )    @xmath60    where differentiation with respect to @xmath54 inside an expectation value  that is , for an arbitrary configuration rather than an ensemble average  is understood to imply that the reduced coordinates of the configuration , @xmath61 , are held fixed .",

    "this expression can be used to find formulas for the direction in which a given thermodynamic variable is constant , as we do below .",
    "for now we choose @xmath66 , to obtain a formula for derivatives along adiabats ( eq .  ):",
    "@xmath67    as an example , we take @xmath68 . noting that @xmath69 and eq .",
    ", we get    @xmath70    which is a general result that can also be derived thermodynamically starting with the fundamental thermodynamic identity @xmath71 ( here the variables @xmath6 , @xmath5 refer to macroscopic , or thermally averaged quantities , the omission of angle - brackets notwithstanding ) . as a second application of eq .  , consider a system with perfect correlation .",
    "then @xmath72 , and we get    @xmath73    which means that in such systems the derivative along an adiabat is given entirely by the `` intrinsic '' density dependence for individual configurations ; fluctuations do not contribute .",
    "this is of course the case of perfect isomorphs , where the probabilities of scaled configurations are identical along an isomorph .",
    "we consider the derivative of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath54 on an adiabat . from @xmath74",
    ", we have    @xmath75    writing @xmath76 and making use of the general result of eq .",
    ", after some algebra ( see appendix  [ derivation_c_v_deriv ] ) we obtain the simple result    @xmath77    this is a major result of this paper . note that the right side vanishes for perfect correlation ( @xmath78)in which case @xmath0 is constant on the same curves that @xmath53 is ; in other words , @xmath0 is a function of entropy only . for less than perfect correlation ,",
    "the most interesting feature is the sign , which we argue in the next section , is the opposite of that of @xmath3 .",
    "we wish to understand the sign of @xmath80 . we know from eq .   that @xmath6 and @xmath52 are linearly uncorrelated ; we must now consider higher order correlations . recall that @xmath2 may also be interpreted@xcite as the slope of isochores in the @xmath81 phase diagram ",
    "the linear regression of the scatter - plot of instantaneous @xmath81 values at one state point gives the slope of @xmath82 versus @xmath83 at fixed density .",
    "the triple correlation is related to the curvature of the isochore , and thus to @xmath84 .",
    "we can get the exact relation differentiating @xmath2 with respect to @xmath42 :    @xmath85    where we have used eq . and some algebraic manipulation as in appendix  [ derivation_c_v_deriv ] .",
    "combining this result with eq .   gives    @xmath86    or more concisely @xmath87      the last result implies , in particular , that the sign of the density - derivative of @xmath0 along an isomorph is opposite to that of @xmath89 . since the latter derivative is neglected in the theory of isomorphs , it is useful to find a connection with a density derivative of @xmath2 .",
    "the relevant derivative turns out not to be @xmath90 but @xmath36 , i.e. the derivative of @xmath2 along the adiabat . for many systems of interest",
    "this derivative has the same sign as @xmath89 , while those signs can be positive or negative depending on the system ( or even for a given system ) .",
    "we shall now argue that this sign - equivalence is to be expected by considering how @xmath2 is related to the pair potential @xmath91 .",
    "this is an interesting question in its own right , and was explored in ref .. for potentials with strong repulsion at short distances , we can indeed relate @xmath2 directly , albeit approximately , to @xmath91 , or more precisely , to its derivatives . as discussed in ref .",
    "the idea is to match an ipl to the actual potential ; @xmath2 is then one third of the `` effective ipl exponent '' .",
    "there are many ways to define such an exponent , but a key insight is that it should involve neither the potential itself ( because shifting the zero of potential has no consequences ) , nor its first derivative ( because the contributions to the forces from a linear term tend to cancel out in dense systems at fixed volume).@xcite the simplest possibility within these constraints involves the ratio of the second and third derivatives . for an ipl , @xmath92 , and indicating derivatives with primes , we have @xmath93 , so @xmath94 can be extracted as @xmath95 . for a general pair potential",
    "this quantity will be a function of @xmath96 , and thus we define the @xmath96-dependent second - order effective ipl exponent @xmath88 as@xcite    @xmath97    the superscript `` ( 2 ) '' indicates which derivative appears in the denominator ; one can similarly@xcite define @xmath98 for @xmath99 ; @xmath100 is the first not involving @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "interestingly , the ipl is not the only solution to @xmath103 with constant @xmath94 ; so is the so - called extended ipl    @xmath104    introduced in ref .. the resemblance of the lennard - jones potential to such a form can be considered an explanation of why it behaves like an ipl system . for a general potential ,",
    "the question that now arises is at which @xmath96 one should evaluate @xmath105 .",
    "it was argued in ref .   that @xmath106 evaluated at a point near the maximum of @xmath107let us",
    "call it @xmath108should correspond to @xmath2 .",
    "one expects that , like the peak in @xmath107 , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is of order unity and depends weakly on temperature , but we do not know it precisely _ a priori_. there are two crucial things we can say , however : first , we can certainly identify @xmath108 _ a posteriori _ by inspection for a given state point : that is , having simulated a reference state point @xmath111 and determined @xmath112 there , it is straightforward to ( typically numerically ) solve the equation @xmath113 for @xmath108 .",
    "the second crucial point is that whatever details of the liquid s statistical mechanics determine @xmath108 ( for instance a kind of @xmath107-weighted average ) , _ these details do not vary along an isomorph _",
    "( this argument assumes good isomorphs , so that the statement can be applied to adiabats ) .",
    "therefore @xmath108 is an isomorph invariant  more precisely its reduced - unit form @xmath114 is constant along an adiabat , which implies @xmath115 .",
