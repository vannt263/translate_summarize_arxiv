    "the concept of wandering intervals plays an important role in studying dynamical behavior of non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system . in the area of interval dynamics ,",
    "most important results are related to the absence of wandering intervals .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to obtain a condition on the orbits of the critical values to ensure the absence of wandering intervals for piecewise @xmath0 interval maps with critical points and discontinuities , and to give a sufficient condition to the nonexistence of wandering intervals for multimodal maps whose orders of critical points are different to the left and to the right .",
    "the motivation to show nonexistence of wandering intervals are well known .",
    "firstly , it is relevant to the isomorphism problem of dynamical system . in the 1880s",
    ", poincar@xmath3 proved that each orientation preserving homeomorphism of the circle without periodic points is semi - conjugate to an irrational rotation .",
    "denjoy showed that for the @xmath4 diffeomorphism of the circle without periodic points such wandering interval can not exist , and this semiconjugacy is indeed a conjugacy .",
    "analogue of denjoy s theory also holds for a @xmath5 unimodal map @xmath6 with a non - flat critical point ( whose orders are equal to the left and to the right ) and negative schwarzian derivative , it was shown that @xmath6 admits no wandering intervals , and it is conjugate to a quadratic map @xmath7 @xmath8 with some value of the parameter @xmath9 @xcite if it has no periodic attractor . secondly , the nonexistence of wandering intervals is also relevant to the dynamics of single dynamical system .",
    "a very remarkable result about iterations of rational maps of the riemann sphere proved by sullivan is that there are no wandering components in fatou set , i.e. , all of the connected components of fatou set of a rational map are eventually periodic @xcite .",
    "the julia -fatou - sullivan theory for the dynamics of rational map is also valid for @xmath4 multimodal maps with non - flat critical points whose orders are equal to the left and to the right , it was shown that there are no wandering intervals for such maps @xcite .",
    "besides the above results , the nonexistence of wandering intervals was proved by a series remarkable works : by schwartz for continuous piecewise @xmath0 interval maps @xmath6 with @xmath10 satisfying lipschitz condition in @xcite , by guckenheimer for maps which everywhere have negative schwarzian derivative in @xcite , by yoccoz for @xmath11 homeomorphisms of the circle with non - flat critical points in @xcite , by blokh and lyubich for smooth interval maps with all critical points are turning points in @xcite and @xcite , and by van strien and vargas for general multimodal maps whose orders of each critical point are equal from both sides in @xcite .",
    "however , the wandering intervals may exist for some maps .",
    "for the continuous case , denjoy s counterexample tell us that a @xmath0 differeomorphism on the circle may have a wandering interval @xcite , and there are @xmath11 maps on compact interval with flat critical points which have wandering intervals @xcite . for the discontinuous case ,",
    "there are wandering intervals for a lorenz map if it can be renormalized to be a gap map with irrational rotation number , berry and mestel showed that wandering intervals exist only in this case for the lorenz map @xmath6 with @xmath10 satisfying the lipschitz condition in @xcite .",
    "there exists affine interval exchange transformations which have wandering intervals @xcite @xcite .    from the above examples",
    ", we can not expect that there are no wandering intervals for discontinuous interval maps with critical points like continuous case under some general conditions . on the other hand",
    ", the known results of nonexistence of wandering intervals for continuous multimodal maps always require the orders of each critical point are the same to the left and to the right .",
    "blokh had asked whether wandering intervals can exist for unimodal maps which are smooth except at their critical point and the critical order is different to the left and to the right ( this question is quoted in @xcite , or @xcite for a general case ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the nonexistence of wandering intervals of interval maps with some additional conditions , and give a sufficient condition to answer blokh s question for general maps in some sense .",
    "we now give the precise statement of our main result .",
    "an interval @xmath12 is a _ wandering interval _ for a map @xmath13 if it satisfies :    \\(a ) its forward iterates @xmath14 are all disjoint for all @xmath15 ;    \\(b ) @xmath12 is not contained in the basin of attraction of an attracting periodic orbit ;    \\(c ) @xmath16 is a homeomorphism for all @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the class of interval maps satisfying conditions 1 and 2 listed below .",
    "then we have the following    * theorem a. * _ wandering intervals can not exist for each map in @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a compact interval @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 be a piecewise @xmath0 interval map with negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "this means that there exists a finite set @xmath22 such that @xmath6 is a diffeomorphism on each component of @xmath23 , and admits a continuous extension to the boundary so that the left and the right limits @xmath24 exist .",
    "we always regard each @xmath25 as two points : @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the concrete values depend on the corresponding one - side neighborhoods we considered .",
    "we assume that each @xmath28 has two one - side critical orders @xmath29 , this means that @xmath30 for @xmath31 in the corresponding one - side neighborhood of c , where we say @xmath32 if the ratio @xmath33 is bounded above and below uniformly in its domain .",
    "when we use @xmath34 , it may be either @xmath35 or @xmath36 , and the concrete value can be easily understood from the context .",
    "if @xmath37 , we say that @xmath38 is a critical point , if @xmath39 , we say that @xmath38 is a bounded derivative point .",
    "note that @xmath38 may be a critical point on one side and is a bounded derivative point . when there is no possibility of confusion , each point @xmath25 will be called a critical point without distinguishing whether @xmath38 is really a critical point with @xmath40 , or @xmath38 is a bounded derivative point with @xmath39 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath6 is with negative schwarzian derivative outside of @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath41 is a convex function on each component of @xmath42 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath6 satisfies the following summability conditions along the critical orbits .",
    "the first summability condition is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the critical point closest to @xmath45 , and @xmath34 and @xmath46 depend on the corresponding one - side neighborhoods .",
    "the second summability condition is @xmath47    according to the first summability condition , a map @xmath48 can not map its critical point to another critical point , i.e. , @xmath49 , and it is easy to see that if all of the critical orders are equal , the first summability condition is equivalent to the second summability condition and @xmath49 .",
    "the above similar summability conditions along the critical orbits have been applied to show the existence of absolutely continuous invariant measure for unimodal maps in @xcite , for multimodal maps in @xcite and for interval maps possible with critical points and singularities in @xcite recently .",
    "the second summability condition is similar to the nowicki - van strien condition in @xcite .",
    "simple examples satisfying the conditions 1 and 2 listed above are the contracting lorenz maps considered in @xcite and @xcite , which were motivated by the study of the return map of the lorenz equations near classical parameter values , see figure 1 . for lorenz map",
    "@xmath6 with @xmath10 satisfying the lipschitz condition , berry and mestel showed in @xcite that wandering intervals exist if and only if it can be renormalized to be a gap map with irrational rotation number .",
    "this , together with theorem a , implies that if a @xmath0 lorenz map @xmath6 with @xmath39 satisfying the summability condition @xmath50 and the negative schwarzian derivative condition , then it can not be renormalized to be a gap map with irrational rotation number . on the other hand , for @xmath4 lorenz map",
    "@xmath6 whose critical orders are greater than @xmath51 , it is conjectured in an old version of @xcite ( arxiv : math/9610222v1 ) and in @xcite that @xmath6 admits wandering intervals if and only if it can be renormalized to be a gap map with irrational rotation number , while theorem a indicates that wandering intervals can not exist for lorenz map @xmath6 satisfying @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , for continuous maps in @xmath18 , we answer the blokh s question in some sense partially .",
    "let @xmath6 be a @xmath0 multimodal map with finite critical points whose orders may not equal to the left and to the right . if @xmath6 satisfies the negative schwarzian derivative condition and our summability conditions",
    ", then @xmath6 admits no wandering intervals .",
    "furthermore , we can prove the following theorem b.    * theorem b. * _ let @xmath6 be a map in @xmath18 , then @xmath6 admits an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure ( acip ) .",
    "moreover , if @xmath53 , the density is in @xmath54 for all @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the maximum of the orders of the critical points .",
    "_    we present some comments on theorem b. at first , theorem b improves a result in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for contracting lorenz maps @xmath6 satisfying the following conditions    \\(1 ) outside of the unique critical point @xmath38 ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath6 is of @xmath5 classes and with negative schwarzian derivative , and with equal critical orders from both sides ;    \\(2 ) ( increasing condition ) @xmath57 , for each @xmath58 and some @xmath59 ;    \\(3 ) ( recurrence condition ) @xmath60 for some @xmath61 small enough , and for all @xmath58 , + then @xmath6 admits an absolutely continuous invariant probability . while theorem b tell us that it suffices to assume the summability condition @xmath62 and the above condition @xmath63 for the contracting lorenz map",
    "moreover , theorem b provides the regularity of the density of the acip .",
    "secondly , theorem b is similar to a result in @xcite .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that for any piecewise @xmath4 interval map @xmath6 possibly containing discontinuities and singularities ( @xmath64 ) and satisfying an analytical condition ( uniformly expanding away from the critical points ) and    \\(1 ) _ bounded backward contraction ( bbc ) property _ , there is a constant @xmath65 such that for all @xmath66 , one can find @xmath67 such that for a neighborhood @xmath68 ( a concrete definition of @xmath68 is stated in section 4 ) of the critical points and each @xmath31 , @xmath69    \\(2 ) _ summability condition along the critical orbit _ @xmath70 then @xmath6 admits only finite number of absolutely continuous invariant ( physical ) probability measures .",
    "note that the summability condition ( [ summability condition ] ) implies our first summability condition ( [ the first summability ] ) and the second summability condition ( [ the second summability ] ) in our argument for @xmath40 , this is because for @xmath71 large enough , @xmath72 by the definition of orders of critical points and @xmath40 . as was stated in @xcite ,",
    "in the special cases in which there are no singularities ( @xmath64 ) , the summability condition ( [ summability condition ] ) can not reduce to the summability condition assumed in @xcite , while our conditions can .    moreover , we can show bbc property under our conditions .    as stated above",
    ", the bbc property is an assumption in @xcite , is also an assumption for the studying of the statistical properties such as decay of correlations and the central limit theorem of interval maps in @xcite , and an important lemma in @xcite .",
    "bbc property is true @xcite for symmetric unimodal maps with negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "it is also proved in @xcite for multimodal case with the same critical orders of all critical points and @xmath73 it is interesting that the motivation of the proof the bbc property in @xcite is to show the existence of the acip , but in our argument we prove the bbc using the methods of the proof of the existence of the acip . we emphasize that the proof of the bbc property of mutlimodal case have to use the nonexistence of wandering intervals for multimodal map [ theorem 1.2 in @xcite ] and the same critical order of all of critical points .",
    "using theorem c , we can consider the decay of correlations and clt for interval maps possibly containing critical points and discontinuities with negative schwarzian derivative , under some summability conditions on the growth of the derivative and recurrence along critical orbits in our future work .",
    "the proof of the nonexistence of wandering intervals of interval maps will be achieved by contradiction , so we suppose that there is a wandering interval @xmath12 . according to denjoy s original ideas , most of the proofs ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite ) of the nonexistence of wandering intervals contain two ingredients : a topological one and an analytical one .",
    "the topological part is to the understanding of the detailed dynamics of interval map , while the analytical part is to estimate the distortion using the topological results .",
    "then , either @xmath12 would be attracted by a periodic orbit or one can get a conclusion that contradicts to the estimation of analytic aspect .",
    "note that the condition that the orders of each critical point from both sides are equal is necessary in both ingredients of previous proofs .",
    "our proof is completely analytical , and has links to the method of the proof of the existence of the acip .",
    "the method , as in @xcite , is to estimate of the lebesgue measure of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a small neighborhood of the critical points .",
    "the proof of theorems can be divided into three steps :    step 1 .",
    "show that if @xmath76 then there exists a constant @xmath77 so that @xmath78 , for any @xmath28 , @xmath79 and small @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "this property relates the measure of preimages of a small neighborhood of the critical points to the measure of neighborhood of the critical points .",
    "show that if @xmath76 and satisfies the above property in step 1 , then there exists a constant @xmath77 so that @xmath82 , where @xmath75 is any borel set .",
    "a more precise version of the above two steps is stated in section 3 .",
    "the proof seems complicated , but it is almost the same as the proof of the existence of the acip of unimodal map in @xcite , multimodal map in @xcite .",
    "step 3 . in section 4 , we present the proofs of theorem a , theorem b , and theorem c. theorem a is a direct consequence of the property in step 2 .",
    "the proof of theorem b is classical when @xmath6 is continuous .",
    "in fact , if @xmath6 is continuous , the existence of acip follows from proposition 2 and the compactness of the space of probability measure on @xmath19 under the weak star topology .",
    "this kind of argument can not be applied to our case directly because @xmath6 may have discontinuities .",
    "we obtain the existence of acip by checking the uniformly integrability of the action of frobenius - perron operator on the constant function @xmath83 .",
    "to show theorem c , the result in step 1 indicates that if @xmath76 then there exists a constant @xmath65 such that @xmath84 for @xmath85 , because the critical point will not be mapped into another critical point .",
    "this property implies that the derivatives of the preimages of the critical points are bounded away zero .",
    "next we can find enough koebe spaces so that we can relate the derivatives of the preimages of the critical point to the derivatives of the preimages of any point in the neighborhood of the critical point by the one - side koebe principle .",
    "we refer @xcite for the proof of the koebe principle .",
    "it is possible to improve these results .",
    "the negative schwarzian derivative condition may be omitted , however the strategy in @xcite and @xcite made use of the nonexistence wandering intervals , and the method in @xcite involves detailed analysis of topological dynamics of intervals maps . note that the negative schwarzian derivative condition rule out the existence of the singularities ( @xmath64 ) , once one can get rid of this negative schwarzian derivative condition , then the results in this paper can generalized to the interval maps with singularities and critical points .",
    "secondly , general methods of proving the existence of the acip of smooth maps may work efficiently without using the result of the nonexistence of wandering intervals , the quite general conditions are known to guarantee the existence of the acip for smooth maps with a finite number of critical points recently in @xcite , but they used the results of the nonexistence of wandering intervals , too",
    ". however , it was conjectured by ara@xmath86jo et al . in @xcite",
    "that it is not possible to obtain a general result about the existence of acip in the presence of both critical points and singularities by assuming conditions on the derivatives growth of the critical points .",
    "we denote by @xmath87 the constant from the orders of the critical points , by @xmath88 from the koebe principle , and denote @xmath89 as the lebesgue measure of @xmath12 .",
    "in this section , we will use the proof of the existence of acip of unimodal maps and multimodal maps , see @xcite and @xcite , and we refer the chapter 5 of @xcite for more details .",
