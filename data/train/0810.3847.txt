    "the low - energy behavior of quantum dot josephson junctions is governed by an interplay of superconductivity and the kondo effect .",
    "the physics emerging from the competition of these correlation phenomena was discussed decades ago in the context of magnetic impurities inside superconducting metals.@xcite if the kondo energy scale @xmath4 is much larger than the superconducting gap @xmath5 , local magnetic moments are screened by virtue of the kondo effect .",
    "this causes cooper pairs to break , and the ground state of the system becomes a kondo rather than a bcs singlet . in the opposite limit @xmath6 , kondo screening",
    "is disturbed due to the superconducting gap at the fermi energy , and the ground state describes free magnetic moments . at temperature @xmath7 , a first order level - crossing quantum phase transition from a non - magnetic singlet to a degenerate ( so - called magnetic ) ground state is observed if @xmath8 increases .    in recent years ,",
    "the rise of nanotechnology allowed for sandwiching quantum dots between superconducting electrodes and for measuring the equilibrium josephson current as a function of well - controlable microscopic parameters.@xcite this was the motivation to theoretically re - investigate the interplay between superconductivity and kondo physics in the context of ( anderson - like ) models which feature all parameters ( and not only @xmath8 ) necessary to describe the experimental quantum dot josephson junction.@xcite both the phase boundary between the ( kondo ) singlet and the ( magnetic ) doublet phases and the supercurrent were calculated using reliable many - particle methods to tackle the vital coulomb interaction @xmath0.@xcite in particular , is was demonstrated that the critical supercurrent as a function of the quantum dot energy @xmath9 can be obtained in good agreement with experimental data.@xcite    if a quantum dot is placed in one arm of a non - superconducting closed aharonov - bohm geometry , signatures of the fano effect can be experimentally observed in mesoscopic systems.@xcite in addition , the interferometric setup allows for extracting physical properties which can not be accessed by measurements on the isolated dot ( such as the transmission phase).@xcite both situations were investigated theoretically using anderson - like impurity models as well as appropriate many - body methods in order to obtain a physical understanding consistent with the observed data.@xcite in contrast , no interferometric experiments on quantum dots within a superconducting environment have been performed so far .",
    "however , in consideration of the rapid progress in nano science it is reasonable to assume that experimental ( e.g. , transport ) data on such setups will become available fairly soon .    as mentioned above , both the singlet - doublet phase transition and the supercurrent of the quantum dot josephson junction were extensively investigated theoretically , most times employing the single impurity anderson model with bcs source and drain leads.@xcite in contrast , the aharonov - bohm situation where both superconductors are in addition directly linked by a hopping matrix element @xmath10 has only been partly investigated .",
    "zhang used a slave - boson mean - field approach to compute the supercurrent for the ( singlet ) situation where the kondo temperature @xmath4 is larger than the energy gap @xmath5.@xcite however , the author fails to obtain correct results in the analytically - solveable non - interacting case @xmath11 , rendering his results questionable.@xcite the opposite ( doublet ) situation with @xmath12 was studied by osawa , kurihara , and yokoshi.@xcite they employ , however , a hartree - fock framework which can not account properly for kondo correlations , the latter being a vital ingredient for the problem at hand . most surprisingly",
    ", both works do not at all address the question whether the general picture of the existence of singlet and doublet low - energy states survives if the superconductors are connected directly , and , if so , how the ground state actually depends on the physical parameters ( particularly @xmath10 ) of the system .",
    "it is the first aim of this paper to clarify this issue and to demonstrate that the @xmath7 ` phase boundary ' is affected non - monotonically by a finite coupling @xmath13 , causing the system to exhibit re - entrance behavior and multiple singlet - doublet transitions .",
    "secondly , we present reliable results for the zero - temperature josephson current @xmath14 for arbitrary system parameters ( not focussing on a specific regime of @xmath8@xcite ) and particularly illustrate that @xmath14 can become negative in the singlet phase.@xcite our starting point is the so - called atomic limit @xmath1 which can be treated analytically even in presence of finite coulomb correlations . in order to address arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath3",

    "however , for the simple quantum dot josephson junction ( @xmath15 ) it was demonstrated that generic physics shows up for small values of @xmath118 ( but not neccessarily extremely small @xmath4 itsself).@xcite since we do not observe any qualitative changes apart from an overall increase of the size of the singlet phase in going from @xmath1 to @xmath119 , it is reasonable to assume that the same holds for the problem at hand .    for the simple quantum dot josephson junction ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "it was previously observed that in the doublet phase the supercurrent obtained from the frg is completely independent of both the two - particle interaction strength @xmath0 and the impurity energy @xmath9.@xcite even though this is an artifact of the approximative approach , numerical rg calculations showed that physical properties only vary slightly in this regime.@xcite    some generalized perturbative approach@xcite could be employed in order to get some intuitive understanding why @xmath14 can become negative in the singlet phase .",
