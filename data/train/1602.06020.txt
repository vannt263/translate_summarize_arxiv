    "photonic crystals are the structures in which some electromagnetic constitutive parameters vary periodically in space @xcite .",
    "these structures exhibit photonic band gaps in their frequency spectra due to the interference of multiply - scattered waves , which influence the wave propagation characteristics enormously .",
    "photonic crystals have played a central role in the modern development of optics and photonics .",
    "more recently , the photonic crystal concept has been extended to plasma physics .",
    "plasma photonic crystals ( ppcs ) refer to plasma media with periodic spatial density variations or periodic composite structures of plasmas and solids .",
    "periodic modulations of the plasma density can be induced in plasma - filled backward - wave oscillators by the ponderomotive potential effect , which is due to the strong interaction between plasmas and two counter - propagating electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to create ppcs using the dielectric barrier discharge method @xcite .",
    "the wave propagation characteristics of various types of one - dimensional and two - dimensional ppcs and their applications have been studied extensively by a number of researchers @xcite .",
    "one interesting phenomenon concerning the propagation of electromagnetic waves in inhomogeneous plasmas is the mode conversion of one type of wave mode into another type in some regions where the two modes meet the resonance condition @xcite .",
    "the irreversible transfer of electromagnetic wave energy to the resonance region associated with the mode conversion occurring in unmagnetized or magnetized inhomogeneous plasmas plays a central role in a wide range of phenomena in plasma physics @xcite .",
    "we are mainly interested in the mode conversion of transverse electromagnetic waves into longitudinal plasma oscillations in cold unmagnetized plasmas , which occurs at the regions where the local dielectric permittivity vanishes , or equivalently , the wave frequency matches the local plasma frequency @xcite . in this paper , we consider plasma density configurations where this resonance condition is satisfied periodically along one direction in space .",
    "the interplay of photonic band gap and mode conversion in such systems has never been investigated before .",
    "we explore this phenomenon by calculating the mode conversion coefficient , which measures the wave absorption , in a numerically exact manner using the invariant imbedding method @xcite .    in a given configuration of the plasma density",
    ", the mode conversion is allowed to occur within a certain frequency band , which we call the mode conversion band .",
    "we find that when the mode conversion band is well within the transmission band of a ppc , the mode conversion coefficient is greatly enhanced for a broad frequency range and for a wide range of incident angle .",
    "this occurs because the wave reflection is strongly suppressed for frequencies in the transmission band and the wave is able to penetrate more deeply into the periodic region , thus enhancing the efficiency of mode conversion .    in sec .",

    "the mode conversion is possible if there exists a region where the real part of @xmath5 vanishes . in the present configuration",
    ", this condition imposes that there is a mode conversion band , or an absorption band , in the frequency region @xmath72 . when @xmath27 , the absorption band is in @xmath73 , as shown in fig .",
    "we have verified numerically that the results do not change as @xmath23 becomes smaller .",
    "when mode conversion occurs , the mode conversion coefficient is finite even in the presence of an infinitesimally small amount of damping at the resonance region , which signifies that the absorption is not due to any dissipative damping process but due to mode conversion . with the choice of @xmath66",
    ", we find that there are a transmission band in @xmath74 and a reflection band in @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , we have chosen the parameter @xmath66 deliberately so that the mode conversion band is well - included in the transmission band . for normal incidence , mode conversion",

    "this result is in sharp contrast to that for the case with a single resonance point , where the mode conversion occurs only for a rather narrow range of incident angle and the maximum value of the mode conversion coefficient is just 0.5 @xcite . combining the results of figs .  3 and 4",
    ", we can conclude that a broadband and wide - angle absorption enhancement is achieved due to the interplay between the mode conversion and the formation of a transmission band in ppcs .    finally , in fig .  5",
    ", we show the spatial distributions of the magnetic field intensity @xmath84 inside the inhomogeneous plasma for @xmath80 and @xmath62 , @xmath68 and @xmath70 , when @xmath27 , @xmath81 , @xmath28 and @xmath66 in linear and logarithmic plots .",
    "we note that the wave is incident from the side where @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath35 is zero , no mode conversion occurs and the field distribution shows the characteristic of an extended state in the transmission band .",
    "the field intensity is not attenuated as the wave propagates toward @xmath86 . when @xmath77 , the mode conversion coefficient is very large ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "even though the overall field intensity decays exponentially with some periodical variation superimposed on it , it remains to be non - negligible close to @xmath86 .",
    "this implies that the mode conversion and the associated resonant absorption occur at all 40 resonance points where @xmath88 , thereby making the value of @xmath52 very large . when @xmath89 , the mode conversion coefficient is smaller ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we observe that the field intensity decays faster than when @xmath77 , which makes a less number of resonance points participate in the mode conversion process , thereby making @xmath52 smaller .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a theoretical study of the mode conversion and the resonant absorption of @xmath0 waves in cold , unmagnetized and stratified plasmas with sinusoidal density variations .",
    "we have calculated the mode conversion coefficient and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field intensity as a function of the frequency and the incident angle using the invariant imbedding method .",
    "we have found that in contrast to the case where there is only one resonance point , the mode conversion coefficient in the periodic case can be significantly enhanced over a wide range of frequency and incident angle , which is due to the interplay between the mode conversion and the formation of a transmission band in ppcs .",
    "we expect that analogous phenomena will occur in more complicated plasmas such as magnetized plasmas with electrons and ions",
