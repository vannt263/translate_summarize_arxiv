    "in this paper we develop the basic existence , uniqueness and regularity theory for the problem @xmath5 u(x,0 ) = f(x)\\ge0 , & \\qquad x\\in\\mathbb{r}.\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the equation in can be viewed as the limit @xmath6 in the so - called fractional porous medium equation , @xmath7 after a shift in the @xmath8-variable and a change in the time scale .",
    "the latter equation was treated in our papers @xcite , @xcite , where it was proved that it generates a contraction semigroup in @xmath9 for any dimension @xmath10 , and that solutions become instantaneously bounded and @xmath11 in space and time for data in @xmath12 with @xmath13 larger than a critical value @xmath14 .",
    "the difficulty we face here is that , according to those papers , the logarithmic diffusion is borderline for regularity questions when @xmath15 and @xmath16 for data in the natural space @xmath17 .",
    "this entails a very delicate critical - case analysis and a new type of regularity results : besides the expected result for @xmath18 with @xmath19 , we obtain that solutions become immediately bounded when @xmath20 belongs to an @xmath2 space , almost @xmath21 but not quite .",
    "this also offers some novelty when compared to the existing results for the standard porous medium equation , given by   with @xmath22 , which are gathered in @xcite and @xcite . actually , we go on to prove that the solutions are @xmath3 in space and time , hence classical .",
    "let us remark that the method proposed to tackle regularity has a more general scope .",
    "actually , it can be applied to positive solutions of equations of the form @xmath23 posed in @xmath24 under quite unrestrictive assumptions on the nonlinearity .",
    "we will study this issue in a forthcoming work .",
    "a further motivation for our study comes from the following connection : equation can be transformed through a special nonlocal change of variables of the bcklund type into the transport equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for a nonlocal operator which is a modification of the hilbert transform .",
    "if instead of @xmath26 we had the standard hilbert transform @xmath27 , using the identity @xmath28 , valid when these operators are applied to regular functions , we would get @xmath29 which is the transport equation with fractional diffusivity proposed by crdoba , crdoba and fontelos in  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the several one - dimensional models considered in the last years to recast the main properties of the three - dimensional incompressible euler equation and the two - dimensional quasigeostrophic equation , beginning with the work by constantin , lax and majda  @xcite .    conveniently reformulated",
    ", our results for problem   produce existence and uniqueness of a _ classical _ global in time solution for equation for all initial data in @xmath21 .",
    "this is a remarkable variation with respect to the results available for problem  : a global in time solution is only known to exist if the initial value belongs to the sobolev space of fractional order @xmath30 , in which case it is in @xmath31 for almost every @xmath32 ; see dong  @xcite . from this regularity",
    "one might try to use the techniques of kiselev , nazarov and shterenberg  @xcite to obtain further smoothness in space .",
    "the application of the present approach to the transport equation   is not immediate and needs further study .",
    "we believe that the connection between fractional diffusion and nonlocal transport problems is worth pursuing , since it may lead to the fruitful combination of very different techniques .",
    "as said above , the case @xmath33 is critical in various aspects , in particular with respect to sobolev embeddings .",
    "thus , in the course of the proof of the smoothing effect in the mentioned @xmath34 space we need to use a critical fractional trudinger type embedding due to strichartz ; see @xcite .",
    "we generalize this embedding to other values of the exponents , a result in pure functional analysis that we hope could be of further application .",
    "we recall that the nonlocal operator @xmath35 , @xmath36 , is defined for any function @xmath37 in the schwartz class through the fourier transform , @xmath38 or via the ( hypersingular ) riesz potential , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a normalization constant ; see for example @xcite . in our case ,",
    "@xmath41 , the constant is @xmath42 , and we also have @xmath43 , where @xmath27 denotes the hilbert transform operator , defined trough @xmath44    if we multiply the equation in by a test function @xmath45 and integrate by parts  , we obtain @xmath46 this identity will be the basis of our definition of a weak solution .",
    "the integrals in   make sense if @xmath8 and @xmath47 belong to suitable spaces .",
    "the correct space for @xmath48 is the homogeneous fractional sobolev space @xmath49 , defined as the completion of @xmath50 with the norm latexmath:[\\[\\|\\psi\\|_{\\dot{h}^{1/2}}=\\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{r } }    the sobolev space @xmath30 is then defined through the norm @xmath52    [ def : weak.solution.nonlocal ] a function @xmath8 is a _ weak _",
