    "the fundamental importance of element settling ( also called microscopic diffusion ) inside stars was recognized by the pioneers of stellar structure computations ( see references in vauclair and vauclair 1982 ) .",
    "a star is a self - gravitational gaseous sphere , composed of all possible kinds of different chemical elements , with different masses and atomic spectra . due to the pressure and thermal gradients and to the selective radiative transfer , individual elements diffuse inside the star , one with respect to the other , leading to a slow but effective restructuration . mixing processes like convection , turbulence , rotation - induced internal motions ,",
    "compete with microscopic diffusion and decrease its efficiency according to the strength of the resulting homogeneization .",
    "when von zeipel ( 1924 ) demonstrated that , due to centrifugal effects on the equipotentials of gravity , rotating stars could not be in radiative equilibrium , he concluded that the resulting thermal imbalance lead to meridional circulation which could be the reason why the effects of microscopic diffusion were not seen in most stars .",
    "much later , when evidences of  chemically peculiar stars \" where obtained , astrophysicists first discussed them in terms of nuclear or spallation reactions .",
    "these explanations could not however account for the observations ( see , for example , vauclair and reeves 1972 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the idea that these abundance anomalies could be due to microscopic diffusion emerged again and gave interesting results ( michaud 1970 , michaud et al .",
    "1976 ( mcv@xmath1 ) , vauclair et al .",
    "1978 a and b ( v@xmath1 m and v@xmath1sm ) ) . from then on , for more than two decades , this became  the diffusion hypothesis \" which was supposed to be added to the physics of peculiar stars , for the aim of explaining their anomalies .",
    "this interpretation was misleading in the sense that it presented element diffusion as a somewhat  ad hoc \" process added in some cases , forgetting its fundamental character in the structure of self - gravitational spheres .",
    "the importance of element settling in the stellar evolution process has recently been proved in the sun by helioseismic investigations .",
    "it was known for a long time that helium and metals should have diffused by about @xmath2 down from the solar convective zone since the birth of the sun up to know ( aller and chapman 1960 ) .",
    "recent comparisons between the sound velocity inside the sun as computed in the models and as deduced from the inversion of seismic modes , confirmed that this settling really occurred .",
    "in fact , element diffusion is always present in stars , unless hydrodynamical processes increase its time scale in such a way that it becomes much larger than the stellar lifetime . in this framework ,",
    "the basic difficulty is not to account for the occurrence of abundance anomalies in some stars , but to understand why the consequences of diffusion processes are not seen in all the stars and also why , in chemically peculiar stars , the observed anomalies are not as strong as predicted by the theory .",
    "this is related to the hydrodynamical processes which occur in stellar radiative zones and may slow down the element settling .",
    "rotation - induced mixing is certainly one of the most important of these processes .",
    "the process of meridional circulation and its consequences have been studied by many authors , including eddington ( 1926 ) , sweet ( 1950 ) , mestel ( 1953 , 1957 , 1961 ) , tassoul and tassoul ( 1982 , 1983 , 1989 ) , zahn ( 1992 , 1993 ) , maeder and zahn ( 1998 ) .",
    "the way such processes can slow down diffusion have also been studied many times in the literature , beginning with schatzman ( 1977 ) , v@xmath1sm and v@xmath1 m .",
    "zahn ( 1992 , 1993 ) suggested that the transport of angular momentum induced by the meridional flow could lead to shear flow instabilities . due to the density stratification",
    ", these instabilities should create anisotropic turbulence , more important in the horizontal than in the vertical direction .",
    "the coupling between the meridional advection and the horizontal turbulence would lead to a special kind of mixing for the chemical species , parametrized as an effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "such a description has been used , for example , by pinsonneault , deliyannis and demarque ( 1992 ) , charbonnel , vauclair and zahn ( 1992 ) , richard et al ( 1996)(rvcd ) .    later on ,",
    "the transport of chemical species and angular momentum were consistently coupled in the computations , with the assumption that no other process interferred with rotation - induced mixing ( zahn , talon and matias 1997 , talon and charbonnel 1998).the results predicted a non negligible differential rotation inside the solar radiative regions , in contradiction with helioseismology .",
    "the fact that the sun rotates like a solid body below the convection zone proves that angular momentum has to be tranported by another process , presumably magnetic fields ( mestel , moss and tayler 1988 , charbonneau and mac gregor 1992 , gough and macintyre 1998 ) .",
    "> from the beginning of these computations of rotation - induced mixing , the importance of the feed - back effect due nuclearly - induced @xmath3-gradients was well recognized .",
    "mestel and moss ( 1986 ) showed how these @xmath4-gradients could slowly stabilize the circulation and expel it from the core towards the external layers .",
    "they called this process  creeping paralysis \" . indeed , without such a stabilization of the meridional circulation , the stars could not become red giants in the correct time scale .",
    "however , in all these computations the feed - back effect due to the diffusion - induced @xmath4-gradients on the meridional circulation was not included or artificially reduced to prevent numerical instabilities .",
    "vauclair ( 1999 ) showed how , in slowly rotating stars , the resulting terms in the computations of the circulation velocity could rapidly become of the same order as the other terms .",
    "thado and vauclair ( 2001 ) computed these terms for the case of pop ii stars and claimed that the induced diffusion - circulation coupling could be the reason for the very small dispersion of the lithium abundances observed in halo stars .    while the @xmath4 terms due to element settling have definitely to be taken into account in the computations of rotation - induced mixing , the details of the coupling process which occurs when these terms become of the same order of magnitude as the classical terms remain difficult to handle . in the present paper",
    ", we introduce an analytical approach of the process in solar type stars and discuss an approximate solution in a quasi - stationary case . in a second paper ( thado and vauclair 2002a , herafter referred to as paper ii ) , we will present the results of a 2d numerical simulation which will help visualize the situation and give a prescription for introducing this process in 1d stellar evolution codes . the case of earlier spectral types ,",
    "when the so - called  gratton-@xmath5pik term \" becomes larger than unity below the convective zone , will be discussed in a third paper , with applications to galactic clusters ( thado and vauclair 2002b , paper iii ) .",
    "our conclusion will be that the feed - back effect due to diffusion - induced @xmath4-gradients may strongly modify the meridional circulation and meanwhile reduce the efficiency of diffusion as suggested in thado and vauclair 2001 .",
    "in rotating stars , due to the centrifugal forces , radiative equilibrium is not satisfied .",
    "this has to be compensated by a motion of matter with a vertical velocity derived form the equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the nuclear energy production , negligible in the outer layers , f the radiative flux , s the entropy density , @xmath8 the local density , @xmath9 the local temperature , @xmath10 the matter velocity .",
    "> from eq.(1 ) we deduce the vertical component of the circulation velocity which , if developped on the second legendre polynomial , may be written ( zahn 1993 , maeder and zahn 1998 , herafter mz98 ) : @xmath11    following zahn 1993 and mz98 , all physical parameters are developped on a level surface in the form : @xmath12    then @xmath13 is obtained as : @xmath14\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the local pressure , @xmath16 the gravity , @xmath17 the specific heat at constant pressure , and : @xmath18    this parameter was referred to as @xmath19 in mz98 : we prefer to call it @xmath20 to avoid any confusion with the latitude angle , specially when we treat 2d numerical simulations ( paper ii ) ; note that , in mz98 equation ( 4.38 ) , @xmath21 was forgotten in the second term of the bracket , as well as in the first term of equation ( 4.36 ) .    we have neglected the deviations from perfect gas law , which are not important for the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the thermodynamical parameters are averaged over level surfaces : in the following the bars will be omitted for simplicity .",
    "following mz98 , @xmath22 is the luminosity at radius @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the stellar mass at radius @xmath23 and @xmath26 the mean density inside the sphere of radius r.    in most stellar situations , the term @xmath27 is negligible . in the present paper ,",
    "we discuss the case of solar type stars where the  gratton-@xmath28pik term \" @xmath29 ( larger than the previous term as @xmath30 replaces @xmath26 in the denominator ) is always smaller than one below the convective zones .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we will replace @xmath31 by @xmath25 in the following equations .",
    "the case where the ",
    "gratton-@xmath28pik term \" is not negligible in radiative zones ( e.g. in f and a stars ) , will be studied in a forthcoming paper ( thado and vauclair 2002b , paper iii ) .    in equation ( 3 ) , the terms related to the @xmath4-gradients are gathered in @xmath32 while the classical terms appear in @xmath33 . when the energy production terms are negligible ( as in the regions below the outer convective zone , when element settling is important ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by : @xmath35 -\\frac{\\rho _ { m}}{\\rho } \\left [   \\frac{r}{3}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left ( h_{t}\\frac{d\\zeta } { dr}-\\chi _",

    "it is due to the fact that such a turbulence modifies the radiative energy transport . in mz98",
    ", this term is added in the expression of @xmath46 ( their equations 4.36 and 4.37 ) .",
    "we prefer to add it separately as : @xmath47 which can also be written : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the thermal diffusivity ( zahn 1993 ) . in this way ,",
    "equation ( 3 ) may be written : @xmath50 with : @xmath51    note that the fourth term @xmath52 has a different behavior from the other ones , as it is formally proportional to @xmath13 when the horizontal diffusion coefficient @xmath45 is approximated as in mz98 , that is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an unknown coefficient .",
    "rigorously , it should be introduced in a different way , on the left side of equation ( 11 ) .",
    "we prefer to leave it presently on the right side and will show later ( section 3.3 ) how the prescription given for its parametrisation induces that it must be negligible compared to the other terms",
    ".    then the horizontal component of the meridional velocity is deduced from the equation of matter conservation : @xmath55 so that : @xmath56    in the classical eddington sweet circulation , only @xmath43 is introduced in the computations . in this case , the divergence of the upward flux is negative : for mass conservation , matter flows horizontaly from the upward flux towards the downwards flux .",
    "this situation may be dramatically modified when the other terms are introduced , and particularly in the situation when @xmath32 becomes of the same order as @xmath43 while the two other terms are smaller .",
    "according to the period in stellar evolution , the four terms included in equation ( 11 ) may have various relative importance . here",
    "we wish to compare their orders of magnitude in solar type stars . before that",
    ", we have to discuss the various ways of computing the horizontal @xmath4 gradients @xmath57 which enter the @xmath32 term .      due to the meridional circulation ,",
    "vertical @xmath58gradients give rise to horizontal ones as the upward flow brings up matter with a larger @xmath4 while the downward flow brings down matter with a smaller @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting horizontal @xmath4-gradients depend on whether horizontal turbulence is present or not .    in case of a laminar circulation ( pure advection ) , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are of the same order , the order of magnitude of @xmath38",
    "is simply given by : @xmath61 ( the case where @xmath59 and @xmath60 have different orders of magnitude will be came upon and studied in section 4 )    according to zahn ( 1992 ) and chaboyer and zahn ( 1992 ) , the shears induced by the circulation lead to horizontal turbulence , which reduces the horizontal @xmath4-gradients . in this case , introducing a horizontal diffusion coefficient @xmath62 , the local variations of @xmath4 are solutions of : @xmath63 in the stationary case , the horizontal @xmath4-gradient including turbulence is given by : @xmath64 with the assumption that : @xmath65 , this equation becomes : @xmath66 where @xmath54 should be of order unity ( mz98 , equation 4.41 ; note that we have chosen here the mz98 definition of @xmath54 , which is the inverse of its definition in chaboyer and zahn 1992 )    at the beginning of the stellar evolution on the main sequence , @xmath38 is equal to zero . in the case of negligible differential rotation ,",
    "it increases and eventually reaches the critical value for which @xmath67 .",
    "let us call this value @xmath68 .",
    "it only depends on the physical conditions in the star , without any arbitrary parameter .",
    "if we neglect the derivatives of @xmath57 ( in paper ii , all the terms will be included in the complete 2d simulation ) , we find : @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the part of the expression of @xmath43 which remains when the differential rotation is negligible .",
    "we see that @xmath68 varies like @xmath71 . in solar type stars , it is of order @xmath72 for rotation velocities of order @xmath73 km.s@xmath74 ( thado and vauclair 2001 ) . in case of non negligible differential rotation ,",
    "the value of @xmath75 may become larger than @xmath68 .    when there is a non negligible radial differential rotation in the stellar radiative zone , @xmath76 .",
    "a special situation occurs if @xmath20 becomes equal to @xmath77 .",
    "the equation of state leads to : @xmath78 or : @xmath79 ( if the equation of state is different from perfect gas law , factors of order unity have to be taken into account in these equations ; we neglect them in the present discussion for simplicity )    if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 is constant along a level surface . if @xmath82 , the temperature fluctuations vanish and the circulation stops unless forced by another process like angular momentum transport . in this special case",
    "we may write @xmath43 as : @xmath83 -\\frac{\\rho _ { m}}{\\rho } \\left [ \\frac{r}{3}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left ( h_{t}\\frac{d\\lambda } { dr}-\\chi _ { t}\\ \\lambda \\right ) -\\frac{2h_{t}}{r}\\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\lambda \\right]\\ ] ]    then @xmath84 becomes : @xmath85 which is about 100 times larger than @xmath68 below the convective zone of solar type stars",
    ".      suppose that @xmath87 increases rapidly from @xmath88 to @xmath84 at the beginning of the stellar lifetime on the main sequence .",
    "writing @xmath89 we obtain : @xmath90 as @xmath70 varies like @xmath91 , equation ( 26 ) may be written : @xmath92 so that @xmath86 may be larger than @xmath70 only if : @xmath93    in consequence , the term @xmath86 may be dominant in equation ( 11 ) during rotational braking , if the braking time scale is smaller than :    @xmath94    for solar type stars , this time scale is of order @xmath95s , i.e. a few million years .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath86 term may be important only at the beginning of the stellar lifetime , and only if the time scale for the angular momentum transport is smaller than a few million years .",
    "then , it becomes negligible compared to the two other terms , @xmath43 and @xmath32 .this situation may be different in late stages of stellar evolution , as the internal structure of the stars then evolve in smaller time scales , leading to a more rapid restructuration , while diffusion processes are slowed down because of deep convective zone .",
    "however @xmath0-barriers induced by nuclear reactions then have to be taken into account , which may change the landscape .",
    "let us now discuss the @xmath52 term in equation ( 13 ) , as given by equation ( 10 ) .",
    "this term is proportional to @xmath20 and vanishes in case of negligible differential rotation .",
    "suppose that , on the contrary , this term becomes preponderant in equation ( 12 ) .",
    "replacing @xmath96 by its expression @xmath97 , this equation becomes : @xmath98 @xmath13 being on both sides disappears , and the coefficients in front of @xmath99 are completely determined by the stellar structure , so that the product of these two terms should be fixed , which does not seem credible . at the bottom of convective zones in solar type stars , the order of magnitude of the product @xmath99 as derived from equation 30 is typically one .",
    "as @xmath20 is of order @xmath72 to @xmath100 maximum , it would need a coefficient @xmath54 of order @xmath101 to @xmath102 , much larger than one . in consequence , @xmath52 is always negligible in the computations .    in the following section",
    ", we discuss the situation which happens when @xmath86 and @xmath103 are negligible and @xmath104 becomes of the same order as @xmath105 .",
    "due to helium settling below the stellar convective zones in solar - type stars , a @xmath4-gradient can built so that @xmath106 becomes very close to @xmath105 in a time scale which depends on the local conditions but may be much shorter than the main - sequence lifetime ( vauclair 1999 , thado and vauclair 2001 ) . in the case",
    "when @xmath107 , a local process emerges where too  big terms \" ( @xmath32 and @xmath43 ) nearly cancel each other , thereby creating numerical instabilities in ordinary  diffusion and mixing \" computations . in vauclair 1999 and thado and vauclair 2001",
    ", we suggested that both the mixing and the settling were then strongly modified .",
    "here we try to understand in more details what physically happens in the star when this situation occurs .",
    "we study it first in an approximate analytical way and later , in a second paper , we will present a complete 2d numerical simulation of this process ( thado and vauclair 2002a , paper ii ) .",
    "if @xmath86 is negligible , and @xmath32 nearly cancels @xmath46 , we may expect , at first sight , that rotation - induced mixing freezes out , like in the nuclear core of the star ( mestel and moss 1986 ) .",
    "this  creeping paralysis \" would first occur in the region just below the convective zone , and slowly extend down to deeper layers .",
    "however such a scheme forgets that helium settling would go on in this case , changing both the vertical and horizontal @xmath4-gradients with time .",
    "thus no equilibrium could be reached , and circulation would proceed again .",
    "this is the situation we analyse below .",
    "suppose that the circulation is nearly frozen in a region just below the convective zone .",
    "this means that on every level surface , the horizontal @xmath4-gradient @xmath38 is just equal to the critical value @xmath108 , for which @xmath109 is equal to @xmath105 .",
    "however , helium diffuses out of the convective zone where it is completely homogeneous , that is @xmath110 . because of this diffusion , the horizontal @xmath4-gradient is always forced to remain below the critical value in a boundary layer just below the convective zone ( in this analysis , we do not take into account any overshooting or tachocline , but it would reinforce this conclusion ) . under such conditions ,",
    "the radiative unbalance which is responsible for the meridional circulation and subsequent mixing still exists in this boundary layer while it is mostly cancelled out in the frozen region below ( but it still exists deeper in the star ) .",
    "let us go back to the equation of matter conservation ( 14 ) . in normal ( classical ) meridional circulation ,",
    "the flux divergence is negative and matter is expelled horizontally from the upward flow to the downward flow . here , on the contrary ,",
    "as the vertical circulation velocity becomes very small below the convective zone except in the boundary layers where it increases rapidly upwards , the flux divergence is positive and matter is  aspirated \" instead of being expelled .",
    "we expect that this situation must result in a local loop of matter which closes horizontaly from the downward flow to the upward flow ( figure 1 )",
    ". this may , in first approximation , lead to a quasi - stationary stage that we discuss below .",
    "we assume that @xmath111 is equal to @xmath112 below the convective zone except in a few layers where it decreases exponentially from @xmath112 to 0 . that is : @xmath113\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is a scale height which may be identified to the diffusion scale height and @xmath115 the radius at the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "let us call @xmath116 the value of @xmath13 obtained when @xmath117 ( classical meridional circulation ) .",
    "when @xmath118 , we may write : @xmath119 assuming , in first approximation , that @xmath120 , equation ( 32 ) becomes : @xmath121    we may now calculate , from equation ( 14 ) , the magnitude @xmath122 of the horizontal velocity which we define by : @xmath123    neglecting the @xmath124 variation in the boundary region , for a first approximation , we obtain : @xmath125 \\exp \\left ( -\\ \\frac{r_{c}-\\ r}{h}\\right)\\ ] ] as @xmath126 , this equation becomes : @xmath127 thus the horizontal velocity is much larger that the vertical one for matter conservation :    @xmath128    so matter which settles down below the convective zone is swept up again through this boundary loop .",
    "a quasi - stationary stage may take place for which the horizontal @xmath129gradient @xmath77 does not change with time , except for the slow increase of the scale height @xmath130    in this case , the continuity equation may be written in first approximation : @xmath131 so that @xmath77 must be written : @xmath132 the vertical @xmath129gradient is fixed from this relation : @xmath133\\ ] ]    although these computations are approximate , they show how the coupling between helium settling and rotation - induced mixing can slow down both the mixing and the settling when the @xmath134-terms are of the same order as the @xmath135-terms in the velocity of meridional circulation .",
    "this does not completely stop the diffusion , but matter flows ajust themselves so that , in the layers where this process occurs , the vertical @xmath136-gradients remain constant .",
    "we see from figure 1 that matter is flowing in opposite directions below the convective zone and deeper in the star .",
    "this could create shear flow instabilities in - between .",
    "however , as will be discussed in paper ii , the frozen zone is large enough and is the site of a stabilizing vertical @xmath137-gradient , so that we expect this effect to be negligible . as",
    "diffusion proceeds slowly , the @xmath114 scale height increases with time : it is not a complete stationary stage .",
    "but we expect the element settling to be significantly reduced by this process , which may completely change the landscape of abundance variations in slowly rotating stars , as already suggested by vauclair ( 1999 ) and thado and vauclair ( 2001 ) .",
    "in the present paper , we have discussed the orders of magnitude of the various terms which enter the computation of the meridional circulation velocity in solar type stars . we have shown in an approximate way what happens when the terms due to the diffusion - induced @xmath136-gradient become of the same order as the classical terms in the circulation velocity . in this case the pattern of the meridional circulation is dramatically modified .    when the @xmath136-terms are not taken into account ( classical circulation ) ,",
    "a prescription may be used , as given by zahn ( 1992 ) , to compute the transport of chemical elements . due to angular momentum transport ,",
    "a shear flow instability may develop which leads to anisotropic turbulence , smaller in the vertical than in the horizontal direction because of the density gradient .",
    "the horizontal turbulence is parametrised by a turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath138 while the vertical transport , which is a combination of the meridional advection and the horizontal turbulence , is treated with an effective diffusion coefficient :      when the @xmath136-terms are taken into account , the prescription must be modified .",
    "horizontal turbulence has two effects : first it slows down the construction of horizontal @xmath136-gradients , thereby delaying the time when the @xmath136-terms become of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath140-terms ; second it helps transporting energy horizontaly ( the so - called @xmath52 term in equation ( 12 ) ) .",
    "we have shown however that the @xmath52 term can never be preponderant , because of its dependance on @xmath13 , which is consistent with the fact that @xmath54 should be of order one . in this case , as discussed in vauclair and thado ( 2001 ) for halo stars and will be discussed again for other cases ( paper ii and paper iii ) , the @xmath136-terms and the @xmath140-terms become of the same order during the main sequence lifetime of most solar type stars .",
    "then the process described here has to be taken into account .",
    "we have shown that , when @xmath141 becomes very close to @xmath105 , matter flows may ajust so that the vertical @xmath136-gradient @xmath142 remains constant in the  frozen zone \" .",
    "this  self - regulating process \" will be confirmed by the 2d numerical simulation ( paper ii ) .",
    "it can be used as a prescription in stellar evolution codes for the computations of abundance variations of chemical elements .",
    "it assumes however that the time scale for restoring the equilibrium @xmath136-gradient is short compared to the time scale of the element settling process which tends to destabilize it . in other words , it assumes that @xmath143 is larger than the microscopic diffusion velocity .",
    "this is the case below the convective zone , but it may not be the case deeper in the star where @xmath143 decreases quicker than the diffusion velocity .",
    "this is why , in vauclair and thado ( 2001 ) , we assumed that the  self - regulating \" process occurred only in the region where @xmath143 was larger than @xmath144 and that microscopic diffusion occurred unaltered below .",
    "the question may arise of the orders of magnitude of the other terms in equation ( 13 ) compared to the difference @xmath145 when this difference is small . in any case , as we have seen , the term @xmath146 can never become preponderant .",
    "what about the @xmath86 term ?",
    "@xmath86 is given by equations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) .",
    "we know , from rotational braking in solar type pop i stars , that the external rotation velocity decreases rapidly ( in a few million years ) from about @xmath147km.s@xmath74 to a few km.s@xmath74 and then go on decreasing very slowly . the situation inside the star depends on the process of angular momentum transport . we know",
    ", from helioseismology , that a transport process more efficient than the one induced by the circulation is needed for the angular momentum . as discussed in section 3.3 , @xmath86 may be important at the beginning of the stellar lifetime on the main - sequence , which is consistent with the rotation braking time scale . for it to be also important later , during the self - regulating process",
    ", it would need a time scale ( equation ( 29 ) modified ) :                  in summary , mixing induced by the transport of angular momentum may be important at the beginning of the main sequence stellar lifetime .",
    "later on , the situation below the convective zone is modulated by the competition between the so - called @xmath140-currents , due to the classical meridional circulation and the so - called @xmath136-currents , due to the diffusion - induced @xmath136-gradient . in the present description ,",
    "we have not taken into account other mixing processes which can decrease the horizontal chemical fluctuations , like tachocline layers .",
    "this should be added in future studies .",
    "as proposed in thado and vauclair ( 2001 ) , the reason why no large lithium depletion is observed in most of pop ii main - sequence stars , in contradiction with pop i stars , could be due to a different rotation history : as the two stellar populations were formed in the galaxy in different circumstances and at different ages , it could be that pop ii stars suffered less rotation braking than pop i stars so that the final lithium abundance and the very small dispersion observed would be a consequence of the  self - regulating process \" .",

    "<S> in the presence of rotation - induced mixing , element diffusion still occurs in stellar radiative zones , although at a slower rate than in the case of a complete stability of the stellar gas . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , helium settling leads to vertical @xmath0-gradients which , due to the meridional circulation , turn into horizontal fluctuations . up to now , the feed - back effect of this process on the rotation - induced mixing was currently neglected in the computations of abundance variations in stellar surfaces , or artificially reduced . here </S>",
    "<S> we analyse its consequences and derive an approximate analytical solution in a quasi - stationary case . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the relative importance of the various physical effects which influence the meridional circulation velocity . in a second paper ( thado and vauclair 2002a ) </S>",
    "<S> , we will present a complete 2d numerical simulation of this process while a third paper ( thado and vauclair 2002b ) will be devoted to special applications to pop i stars . </S>"
