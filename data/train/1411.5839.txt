    "more than eight decades ago , bethe solved @xcite the spin-@xmath0 isotropic heisenberg chain , i.e. the spin-@xmath0 xxx chain , by a method , known as the bethe ansatz . in the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite ,",
    "the eigenvalues and the eigenstates are expressed in terms of the rapidities @xmath7 , known as the bethe roots .",
    "these @xmath7 are the solutions of the bethe ansatz equations , which are a set of polynomial equations , emerge as conditions for the eigenvalue equation of the transfer matrix of the spin-@xmath0 xxx chain .",
    "numerical methods , such as , the newton - raphson , homotopy continuations and iterations are usually deployed to solve the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "the distinct and self - conjugate solutions @xcite of the bethe ansatz equations produce the bethe eigenstates of the spin-@xmath0 xxx chain which are of highest weight . for the higher spin chains ,",
    "however , there are repeated rapidities @xcite in some solutions , which produce the bethe eigenstates .",
    "the complex solutions present more challenges numerically as opposed to the real solutions , which are easier to evaluate .",
    "nonetheless , there has been growing interest in the solutions of the spin-@xmath0 xxx chain in recent years @xcite .",
    "although making use of the _ string hypothesis _ @xcite one can estimate the total number of bethe eigenstates , its certain assumptions do not always hold for any given finite length spin chain .",
    "for example , as the length of the chain increases , some of the two string solutions deform back to form two real distinct rapidities @xcite and some of the two strings have much larger rapidities @xcite for very large length spin chains , which are a violation of the _ string hypothesis_. it is therefore necessary to look into the detailed analysis of the bethe ansatz solutions .",
    "moreover effects of the complex solutions on quantities such as the correlation functions @xcite , form factors and fidelity are also important , while we need complete knowledge of the complex solutions beforehand in order to investigate them explicitly .",
    "it is also worth to mention that some types of solutions of the bethe ansatz equations in the anisotropic heisenberg spin chains are studied in @xcite .",
    "the sets of rapidities associated with the spectrum of the spin-@xmath0 xxx chain are of two classes .",
    "one is regular solutions , for which both the bethe eigenstates and the eigenvalues are finite and well - defined .",
    "the other is the singular sets of rapidities @xcite , which have one pair of rapidities of the form @xmath8 .",
    "as the name suggests , the bethe eigenstates and the eigenvalues are ill - defined because of the pair @xmath8 .",
    "if one straightforwardly plugs the singular solutions into the formula for the bethe eigenstates in the algebraic bethe ansatz method or into the eigenvalues , then the states vanish and the eigenvalues diverge .",
    "singular solutions , nevertheless , are an essential part of the spectrum , because , without them the solutions are not complete .",
    "it is therefore imperative to devise a regularization scheme @xcite to make the singular solutions viable such that both the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues become finite and well - defined .",
    "recently , a detailed investigation is carried out by nepomechie and wang @xcite and extended to higher spin chains @xcite , where the authors first solve the pole free form of the bethe ansatz equations for the singular solutions and then introduce the regularization scheme to obtain a consistency condition , which is satisfied only by the physical singular solutions ( i.e. the solutions which do produce the bethe eigenstates and their corresponding eigenvalues ) .",
    "we note that in the standard approach for solving the algebraic bethe ansatz there is an implicit assumption that no bethe roots contain rapidities of the form @xmath9 .",
    "as mentioned above , the presence of @xmath9 reduce the bethe eigenstates to null states , making the eigenvalue equation trivial .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the implications of the already developed regularization scheme on the even(odd ) length spin chains in some specific down - spin sectors . for an even length spin-@xmath0 xxx chain , the singular solutions which are invariant under the change of sign of each of the rapidities , i.e. @xmath10 , simplify the bethe ansatz equations significantly such that they can be handled easily in the numerical process .",
    "for example , in our previous work @xcite on non self - conjugate strings , singular strings and rigged configurations @xcite of the spin-@xmath0 xxx chain , it helped us obtain the singular solutions in specific cases easily .",
    "we analytically show that the singular solutions @xmath11 are present for any odd - length chain of the form of @xmath5 with @xmath6 . the repetition of these singular solutions with such a periodicity of @xmath12 in @xmath4 has already been confirmed numerically in @xcite for some values of the length of the spin chain .",
    "analytically explicit expressions of the bethe eigenstates for @xmath13 have been obtained for even and odd - length spin chains and the numerical forms of these states are also obtained for some fixed lengths .",
    "a graphical method is provided to search for any singular solution present , if at all , for the @xmath14 sector in some finite odd - length spin chains .",
    "we organize this paper in the following fashion : in the next section , we briefly discuss the algebraic bethe ansatz method for the spin-@xmath0 xxx chain , which sets the basis for the subsequent sections . in section iii , we review the regularization for the singular solutions , which has been studied recently in ref . @xcite . in section",
    "iv we show for the even - length spin-@xmath0 xxx chain that the bethe ansatz equations for the singular solutions such that they are symmetrically distributed in the complex plane of rapidities , i.e. @xmath2 , can be written in a significantly reduced form . the explicit expression of the three down - spin singular bethe eigenstate for even - length chains has been obtained and a derivation of the formulae for the bethe eigenstate with two down - spins and that of three down - spins in the even - length chain have been provided in * appendix [ app1 ] * and * appendix [ app2 ] * , respectively . in section v it is analytically shown that there exist singular solutions of the form @xmath11 in any odd - length chain of the form @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "it is shown in * appendix [ app3]*. the corresponding bethe eigenstates are derived in * appendix [ app21]*. a graphical method is also suggested for the odd @xmath4 cases to search for any possible singular solutions in the @xmath14 down - spin sector and we show that for @xmath15 there is no singular solutions . finally we conclude in section vi .",

    "the eigenstates and eigenvalues of this hamiltonian can be obtained in the algebraic bethe ansatz formulation in the following way .",

    "in this section we review the regularization of the singular solutions , which was introduced in @xcite and later pursued in detail in @xcite , as these results are essential in our study .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the singular sets of rapidities make the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors ill - defined .",
    "it is manifest from the expression that the bethe eigenstate ( [ vec1 ] ) vanishes and the eigenvalue equation ( [ eigen ] ) diverges . by considering typical singular solutions for the @xmath31 down - spins as , @xmath65 it can be easily seen that the presence of @xmath9 in the singular solutions are responsible for the pathology in the expression of the bethe eigenstate and the eigenvalue .",
