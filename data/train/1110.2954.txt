    "the top quark , which is the heaviest known fundamental particle , was discovered in 1995  @xcite at the tevatron proton - antiproton collider at fermilab .",
    "the dominant top quark production mode at the tevatron is @xmath7 . since the time of discovery , over 100 times more data has been collected , providing a large number of  events with which to study the properties of the top quark . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the branching ratio for the top quark to decay to a @xmath2 boson and a @xmath8 quark is @xmath9% .",
    "the on - shell @xmath2 boson from the top quark decay has three possible helicity states depending on the relative direction of the spin and momentum of the @xmath2 boson .",
    "we define the fraction of @xmath2 bosons produced in these states as @xmath5 ( longitudinal ) , @xmath10 ( left - handed ) , and @xmath11 ( right - handed ) . in the sm",
    ", the top quark decays via the @xmath12 charged weak current interaction , which strongly suppresses right - handed @xmath2 bosons .",
    "the sm expected values are @xmath5=0.698 , @xmath10=0.301 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the uncertainties on the sm expectations are @xmath14% for @xmath5 and @xmath10 , and @xmath15 for @xmath11  @xcite .    here",
    "we present a measurement of the @xmath2 boson helicity fractions @xmath5 and @xmath11 and constrain the fraction @xmath10 through the unitarity requirement of @xmath16 . any significant deviation from the sm expectation",
    "would be an indication of new physics , arising from either a deviation from the expected @xmath12 coupling of the @xmath17 vertex or the presence of non - sm events in the data sample .",
    "the extraction of the @xmath2 boson helicities is based on the measurement of the angle @xmath18 between the directions of the top quark and the down - type fermion ( charged lepton or @xmath19 , @xmath20 quark ) decay product of the @xmath2 boson in the @xmath2 boson rest frame .",
    "the dependence of the distribution of on the @xmath2 boson helicity fractions is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "after selection of a ttbar enriched sample the four - momenta of the  decay products in each event are reconstructed as described below , permitting the calculation of .",
    "once the  distribution is measured , the values of @xmath5 and @xmath11 are extracted with a binned poisson likelihood fit to the data .",

    "this analysis is performed using events collected between april 2002 and june 2009 , corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb@xmath1 .",
    "analysis of the run iia sample , which totals about 1 fb@xmath1 , was presented in ref .",

    "we describe the analysis of the run iib data sample and then combine our result with the result from ref .",
    "@xcite when reporting our measurement from the full data sample .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulated samples used for modeling the data are generated with alpgen  @xcite interfaced to pythia  @xcite for parton shower simulation , passed through a detailed detector simulation based on geant  @xcite , and reconstructed using the same algorithms as are used for collider data . for the signal ( )  sample , this analysis requires mc samples with arbitrary non - standard values for the @xmath2 helicity fractions , while alpgen can only produce linear combinations of @xmath12 and @xmath24 @xmath17 couplings .",
    "hence , for this analysis , we use samples that are either purely @xmath12 or purely @xmath24 , and use a reweighting procedure to form models of arbitrary helicity states .",
    "alpgen is also used for generating all @xmath25jets processes where @xmath26 represents the vector bosons .",

    "background from multijet production is modeled using data .",
    "for this analysis , the selection is done in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "a loose initial selection using data quality , trigger , object identification , and kinematic criteria is applied to define a sample with the characteristics of  events .",
    "subsequently , a multivariate likelihood discriminant is defined to separate the  signal from the background in the data .",
    "we use events in the @xmath0jets and dilepton  decay channels , which are defined below .    in the @xmath0jets decay @xmath30 ,",
    "events contain one charged lepton ( where lepton here refers to an electron or a muon ) , at least four jets with two of them being @xmath8 jets , and significant missing transverse energy . for the dilepton decay channel , @xmath31 ,",
    "the signature is two leptons of opposite charge , two @xmath8 jets , and significant .",
    "the main sources of background after the initial selection in the @xmath0jets channel are @xmath32jets and multijet production ; in the dilepton channels they are @xmath33 boson and diboson production as well as multijet and @xmath2+jets production . the multijet contribution to the @xmath0jets final states in the initially - selected sample",
