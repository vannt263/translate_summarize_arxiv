    "a gamma - ray signal from the direction of the galactic center has been established : the recent claims for gamma - rays from the galactic center by the cangaroo collaboration with a signal @xmath7 @xcite and a possible excess claimed by the veritas collaboration on the level of 3.7  @xmath8 @xcite have already stimulated first speculations on the interpretation of the signal as annihilation radiation from dark matter @xcite . finally , the recently commissioned h.e.s.s .",
    "system of cherenkov telescopes has detected a signal from the vicinity of @xcite .",
    "the different confidence regions of the detections by the different instruments in comparison with a 21  cm radio map @xcite are indicated in fig .  1 and the flux measurements are given in fig .  2 .",

    "however , given the positional uncertainty of the cangaroo ii and veritas results evident in fig .",
    "1 , it remains possible that in fact more than one ( possibly even variable ) source may exist in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "interestingly , the observations of h.e.s.s . indicate the presence of even further sources in the field of view ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "further observations with h.e.s.s . and cangaroo iii in the coming years will help to clarify the situation which might be consistent with multiple sources which are not resolvable by single telescope observations .",

    "observations have shown discrepancies in the flux values for other steady sources : sn1006 , psr b1706 - 44 , vela , and rxj1713 - 304 @xcite - a similar situation might be present in this case .    the veritas energy flux given in fig .",
    "2 is converted from the 40  % crab flux as measured with the whipple telescope , assuming a photon index of 2.2 , and using the crab flux as determined by h.e.s.s . to compare the two instruments observations .",
    "the error bars are given as the sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the two measurements are in reasonable agreement and given the possible positive bias in the flux estimate for a source detected at the level of less than 4 standard deviations should be considered to be consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "the discussion here is focussing on the results obtained with the h.e.s.s .",
    "system of telescopes which achieves a superior angular resolution in comparison to the previously published results as is evident from fig .  1",
    ". the reconstructed source location is , within the errors , consistent with the position of ( space angle @xmath9  ) and appears to be consistent with a pointsource for the given angular resolution of @xmath10 ( 50  % containment radius @xcite ) .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations ( spectrum and angular distribution ) are interpreted in the framework of a dark matter annihilation scenario to investigate the consequences for the wimp mass , density , and spatial structure and to understand whether such an interpretation is feasible .",
    "in order to quantify the minimum mass required to explain the observed energy spectrum in terms of an annihilation signal , an assumption on the shape of the annihilation continuum spectrum is required . in the very generic case of a self - annihilating massive wimp , it is assumed that the branching ratio for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is quite large .",
    "subsequent hadronization leads to the production of charged and neutral mesons which decay finally into electrons , neutrinos , and gammas .",
    "the gamma signal is described by a fairly hard differential energy spectrum with an exponential cut - off @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xcite . however , the exact shape of the spectrum depends on details of the branching ratio of other processes .",
    "namely , for @xmath16 , direct radiative losses produce a second hard component .    for the purpose of calculating a lower limit on @xmath17",
    "it is assumed that the branching ratio for @xmath18 or @xmath12is close to one .",
    "the minimum mass requirement is somewhat relaxed if @xmath19 is of importance .",

    "is provided by susy models which naturally predict the existence of a stable ( if r - parity is conserved ) majorana particle that can self - annihilate .",
    "generically , this susy particle is referred to as the lightest stable particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the detection of gamma - rays with energies up to 10  tev as seen with the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes implies that the wimp mass has to be sufficienly large to explain the observed spectrum .",
    "the surprisingly large mass inferred from the observations appears at first glance to be inconsistent with cosmology and the general conception that the mass of lsp in susy models should be close to the electro - weak unification scale @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued that a multi - tev wimp is in fact natural in minimal supergravity models @xcite .",
    "the upper bound on the possible mass of a wimp that decoupled thermally during the early phase of expansion is around 40  tev @xcite for a cosmological non - baryonic dark matter density of @xmath21 .",
    "the average annihilation cross section @xmath22 for susy wimps is in the right range to explain today s dark matter density as determined by the wmap mission : @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , given that for the thermal decoupling @xmath24 and that @xmath25 , rather tight constraints on the mass of the wimp @xmath26  gev can be derived @xcite .",
    "however , as already pointed out in @xcite there are specific manifestations of susy models ( even in the constrained , universal models ) that allow for larger wimp masses which still produce the right relic density :    1 .   for specific susy models",
    "in which the lsp is almost degenerate in mass with other susy particle ( e.g. @xmath27 ) coannihilation depletes the relic density even for a small annihilation cross section .",
    "2 .   for a non - thermal decoupling process",
    ", the relic density as it is today is not depending on the cross section .",
    "3 .   relaxing the universality of the higgs multiplett masses at the gut scale : in this ( and in the general susy ) case , it is conceivable that a massive ( multi - tev ) wimp with the right relic density may exist",
    ". thess wimps are generally almost pure higgsino type neutralinos with a large cross section .    in the first case ,",
    "the cross section for annihilation remains small and therefore requires high relic density values in the galactic center to explain the observed @xmath6-ray flux . in the special case of a degeneracy between the lsp and other susy particles ,",
    "careful tuning is required to achieve the right relic density . for a massive lsp beyond a few tev ,",
    "even co - annihilation does not suffice to reduce the relic density .",
    "a non - thermal scenario invoking q - balls @xcite which replenish the dark matter content via evaporation at some time after the decoupling has been studied in the literature @xcite . in this and other non - thermal scenarios the cross section for",
    "wimps could be rather high .",
    "the last case is more attractive but again requires tuning of the gaugino masses at the unification scale which might appear less attractive from the point of view of a natural theory .",
    "generally , a massive wimp as suggested by the observations with a sufficiently high cross section is not the obvious candidate in the framework of msugra but could be the lsp in slightly less general theories . in this way , thermal decoupling would produce the right relic density and the observed flux could be consistent with a dark matter density which is not violating other astrophysical bounds .    ultimately , a neutralino mass exceeding 40  tev is excluded by the unitarity bound in the framework of thermal decoupling @xcite .",
    "given the measured flux , it is possible ( without assuming a specific halo shape ) to derive an upper limit on the product @xmath28 this is truly an upper limit , as can be seen from the following argument : + assuming that the true density distribution is spherically symmetric and follows a general form @xcite @xmath29^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha}}\\label{eqn : r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the halo density profiles predicted from n - body simulations of hierarchical structure formation follow a power law roughly between @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the annihilation flux observed from within the galaxy is proportional to the line of sight integral @xmath32 averaged over the solid angle observed : @xmath33 with the commonly used normalization for the galactic center : @xmath34 for reasons of simplification and in order to calculate an upper limit , it is convenient to use a truncated version of eq .",
    "[ eqn : r ] which drops to zero outside a spherical volume with radius @xmath35 .",
    "obviously , the derived density to match an observed flux would be higher than in the case of a continuous halo distribution . for a truncated density function with @xmath35 much smaller than the distance of the observer to the sun",
    ", the line of sight integral can be safely replaced by a volume integral and the observed differential gamma - ray flux is given by : @xmath36    considering a truncated density function which follows a single power law up to a radius @xmath35 dropping to zero for larger radii : @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39    and for @xmath40 : @xmath41 which gives for the ratio @xmath42 : @xmath43 this ratio is @xmath44 for @xmath45 . for @xmath46 the trivial case of a constant density and @xmath47 is recovered . for @xmath45 @xmath48 which implies for a given flux ( @xmath49 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : flux ] ) a _ lower _ average density than in the case of a constant wimp density , but it holds true for any @xmath45 . ] .",
    "therefore , calculating an average density with @xmath46 from the observed flux sets an upper limit on the actual average density for a realistic radial density distribution .    for convenience , eq .",
    "[ eq : flux ] can be rewritten with appropriate units : @xmath50 in the more general case of a radial density profile extending beyond @xmath35 , the line - of - sight integral of eq .",
    "[ eq : los ] will naturally give larger observed fluxes ( @xmath51 ) than for a truncated density therefore relaxing the requirement of the average central density @xmath52 even more .",
    "in this sense , the approach of calculating an average , truncated density is truly an upper limit on the average density as expected for a realistic , smooth dark matter halo distribution .",
    "the parameterization for the decay spectrum is of course depending on the nature of the wimp and can not be given in general .",
    "for the case of a very massive wimp considered here , the dominant annihilation channel is into a @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath11 pairs .",
    "a parameterization of the form @xmath53 is a reasonable description of the decay spectrum ( with @xmath54 and @xmath17 in tev , @xmath55 ) .    in order to calculate the upper limit on @xmath52 it is assumed that the entire observed flux is produced by annihilation of wimps .",
