    "in order to improve , e. g. , the performance of nitride - based laser diodes , the density of threading dislocations penetrating into the corresponding layer systems need to be further reduced .",
    "this is a difficult task , when growing such device structures on foreign substrates , e. g. , on sapphire , silicon carbide , or silicon due to a strain - related generation of extended defects .",
    "therefore , the interest in the fabrication of bulk gan substrates as well as of free - standing gan layers ( fs - gan ) for a subsequent homo - epitaxial deposition of device structures is growing .",
    "hydride vapor phase epitaxy ( hvpe ) has already proven to be well suited for the fabrication of fs - gan with threading dislocation densities below 10@xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite commonly , sapphire wafers are used as substrates for the hvpe process to grow fs - gan .",
    "@xcite    however , due to the low cost , available large wafer size , and well - established chemical etching techniques , silicon is very attractive to serve as a substrate material for the growth of fs - gan .",
    "so far , two key problems , which depend on each other , have prevented a successful use of silicon as a substrate for the hvpe growth of fs - gan .",
    "first , there is a high lattice mismatch ( 17@xmath5 ) and a large difference in the thermal expansion coefficient ( 56@xmath5 ) between gan and silicon giving rise to cracking of the gan during the growth as well as during the cooling of the gan substrate from the growth temperature down to room temperature .",
    "second , silicon is not stable in the reactive ambiance and at the high temperatures applied during the hvpe process , where the reaction between silicon and the chlorine - based growth chemistry often results in a mixture of silicon , ga , and n including sin@xmath6 phases ( silicon - melt - back etching ) instead of the intended gan . @xcite    aln buffer layers and a two - step growth mode with first a low - temperature ( low-@xmath1 ) step have been used to suppress the silicon - melt - back etching . also selective - area growth ( sag ) , where the templates for the hvpe consist of a few 100  @xmath0 m large growth windows to prevent cracking , has been applied .",
    "@xcite however , the optimization of the protecting interlayer is very critical . for too thin aln buffer layers ,",
    "the reaction with silicon hinders an epitaxial growth of gan . for too thick buffer layers ,",
    "micro - cracks can appear during the growth , which again open a way for a reaction of si with ga or n. thus , although the growth of a few ten  @xmath0 m thick gan layers on silicon by hvpe has already been reported about 10 years ago @xcite , a long - term hvpe growth of gan on silicon resulting in substrates with a thickness of several hundred  @xmath0 m is still challenging .",
    "furthermore , the use of sag or epitaxial lateral overgrowth techniques require micrometer masking , ex situ sio@xmath7 or sin@xmath6 deposition and multi - step photolithography , which increase the process complexity and costs .",
    "hersee @xmath8@xcite proposed a nano - heteroepitaxy technique , taking advantage of three - dimensional stress relief mechanisms , which is expected to result in a further improvement of gan epilayers grown on foreign substrates . based on this method , several authors have discussed a new non - lithographic nano - heteroepitaxy approach relying on self - assembled nanostructures in order to reduce the process steps and costs .",
    "@xcite kwon @xmath9 @xcite have used a 50  nm thick sputtered aln buffer on silicon , on which they have grown self - assembled nano - needles and -rods during a first low-@xmath1 hvpe step at 600 and 650  @xmath10c , respectively .",

    "@xmath0 m thick gan layers have been overgrown in a second hvpe step at 1040  @xmath10c .",
    "the optical near - band gap emission of these gan layers are red - shifted with regard to the expected spectral position , the origin of which has not been analyzed in detail . moreover",
    ", longer high-@xmath1 hvpe runs to obtain thick gan layers have not been carried out .    in this work",
    ", we are reporting on the hvpe growth of thick gan layers on self - assembled gan nanostructures , the latter having been deposited on si(111 ) substrates with aln buffer layers using plasma - assisted molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) .",
    "the hvpe growth process is investigated by spatially and spectrally resolved cathodoluminescence ( cl ) spectroscopy in a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) at cross - sections of the layers . by adding gan nano - structures as nucleation sites and applying a two - step hvpe growth process , silicon incorporation into several ten  @xmath0 m thick gan layers could be prevented .",
    "three templates have been prepared by mbe for the hvpe overgrowth to obtain several ten to several hundred  @xmath0 m thick gan layers on silicon . for sample s1 ,",
    "a commercial kyma - si / aln template consisting of an n - type si(111 ) wafer and a 200  nm thick al - face aln buffer layer have been used . on top of this template ,",
    "gan has been deposited by mbe at a temperature of 800  @xmath10c setting the iii / v flux ratio to 0.5 . as a result , we obtained gan nanostructures consisting of highly dense 0.6  @xmath0 m high nano - walls and of taller nano - wires ( nw ) with a low density as shown in the sem image of s1 in figure  [ fig1 ] ( a ) and indicated by white arrows in the top view and cross - sectional image of figure  [ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the very thin gan nws visible in figure  [ fig1 ] ( a ) , which emerge from the gan matrix , resemble a lot the ones observed by fernndez garrido @xmath9 @xcite on high quality al - polar aln layers grown on sic ( 0001 ) .",
    "for this reason we believe that the results obtained by fernndez garrido @xmath9 are also valid for sample s1 , that is the very thin gan nws are n - polar , whereas the gan matrix is ga - polar .",
    "the template of samples s2 and s4 consisted of an n - type si(111 ) wafer and a 25  nm thick aln buffer layer grown by mbe at a temperature of 680  @xmath10c with a iii / v flux ratio close to unity .",
    "this si / aln template was transferred to another mbe chamber to add gan nanostructures , which have been grown at 780  @xmath10c using a iii / v flux ratio of 0.31 .",
    "the resulting nanostructures consist of a rough parasitic layer , straight nws with low density , and a large density of tilted nano - leafs [ cf .",

    "the template of the reference sample s3 consists of a si(111 ) wafer and a 15  nm thick aln layer grown by mbe at a temperature of 680  @xmath10c setting the iii / v flux ratio close to unity .",
    "as shown in the atomic force microscopy ( afm ) image of figure  [ fig1 ] ( c ) , the aln layer of s3 is almost contineous with scattered pits .",

    "@xcite    [ 4 cm ]       the described templates showing very different surface structures were overgrown by thick gan layers using a home - made horizontal reactor hvpe system . during the gan growth , n@xmath11 and h@xmath11 were used as a carrier gas with a ratio of 1:1",
    "the temperature of the ga boat was set to about 850  @xmath10c .",
    "the samples s1 to s3 were overgrown separately , but using the same conditions .",
    "we applied a two - step growth mode approach , which consisted of a low-@xmath1 ( 800  @xmath10c ) and a subsequent high-@xmath1 ( 950  @xmath10c ) step . during the first hvpe step , a lower temperature together with low hcl and nh@xmath12 fluxes have been chosen in order to prevent the evolution of silicon - melt - back etching .",
    "the hcl and nh@xmath12 fluxes amounted to 0.01 and 0.6  slm during the first step and to 0.04 and 1.8  slm during the second step .",
    "for s1 and s2s4 , the growth time of the low-@xmath1 step amounted to 20 and 50 minutes , respectively .",

    "after the hvpe growth , the wafers were slowly cooled down from the growth temperature to room temperature over a period of 4 hours .",
    "nevertheless , cracks appeared within the gan layers of s1 to s3 caused by the large tensile strain due to the large difference of the thermal expansion coefficients between silicon and gan .",
    "the typical crack density amounts to several cracks per @xmath22 .",
    "for s1 to s3 , the thickness of the hvpe gan layer amounts to 25 to 35  @xmath0 m .",
    "as confirmed by an energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis at the cross - sections of these hvpe gan layers ( not shown ) , silicon - melt - back etching was successfully suppressed during the hvpe process .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the sem images of the surface of the hvpe gan layers . from sample to sample , the sem images exhibit a varying density and size of v - pits .",
    "the v - pit density amounts to 6.5@xmath2310@xmath24  @xmath4 for s1 , 3@xmath2310@xmath24  @xmath4 for s2 and 1.4  @xmath2310@xmath25  @xmath4 for s3 .",

    "however , such spectral line does not seem to be present in the cl spectra of samples s1s3 , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , or at least its intensity is very weak .",
    "the absence of the cl line at 3.45 ev indicates that the hvpe - gan exhibits a uniform ga - polarity .",
    "furthermore , the cl spectra of the upper part of all hvpe gan layers are dominated by the donor - bound exciton ( dx ) recombination centered at about 3.475  ev .",
    "however , the spectrum of s1 is significantly broadened toward the low - energy side . for the lower part",
    " close to the aln / gan interface  the cl spectra of s1 and s2 are dominated by luminescence lines centered at energy values below 3.44  ev .",
    "we assign these lines to excitons bound to basal plane stacking faults ( i@xmath26 sf , i@xmath7 sf , and e sf ) .",
    "@xcite for sample s3 , the cl spectrum of the lower part of the cross - section shows also significant contributions of sf - related luminescence , which are not as dominant as in s1 and s2 .",
    "in contrast to s1 and s2 , the cl spectrum of the lower part of s3 clearly shows a shoulder at an energy value exceeding the one of the gan band edge [ cf .",
    "dashed arrow in figure  [ fig3](b ) ] . as will be discussed below",
    ", the origin of this high - energy shoulder could be a high unintentional doping of the gan layer close to the si / gan interface due to silicon incorporation .",

    "figure  [ fig4](a ) shows the cl map of the cross - section of sample s1 recorded for @xmath28  ev , which reveals that the donor - bound exciton emission originates from an about 20  @xmath0 m thick upper region of the hvpe gan , while the about 5  @xmath0 m thick bottom layer does not show any significant donor - bound exciton cl .",
    "however , this region at the bottom of the hvpe gan shows significant emission for values of @xmath27 lower than 3.45  ev as shown in figures  [ fig4](b)4(d ) , which we assign to sf - related luminescence .",
    "thus , the cl maps clearly indicate two sharply separated regions along the growth direction , where the sf - related luminescence is found only within a 5  @xmath0 m thick bottom layer , while near - band gap luminescence originates mainly from the upper , thick part of the hvpe gan layer .",
    "the near - band gap luminescence of the upper region shows an inhomogeneous distribution with dark vertical lines and bands resulting from non - radiative recombination at threading dislocations and/or grain boundaries , the density of which decreases along the growth direction .    .",
    "@xmath28  ev corresponds to the donor - bound exciton in gan .",
    "the dashed lines mark the gan / si interface.,width=377 ]    since the formation of sfs in gan is known to be promoted at low growth temperatures @xcite as well as for growth along directions different from the @xmath2-direction @xcite , we conclude that the 5  @xmath0 m thick sf - rich bottom region of the gan layer is a result of the epitaxy during the first , low-@xmath1 hvpe step . due to the typically high growth rate of the hvpe process ,",
    "a temperature of 800  @xmath10c is not sufficiently high to prevent instabilities of the crystallographic phase leading to the evolution of sfs or even of inclusions of the cubic phase of gan .",
    "moreover , at the beginning of the low-@xmath1 growth step , the nucleation of the hvpe gan on the nanostructures is followed by lateral growth , until coalescence is completed , with the latter also being known to lead to the formation of sfs .",
    "@xcite    note that both the cl spectrum of figure  [ fig3](a ) and the cl map of figure  [ fig4](b ) of sample s1 show significant emission for @xmath29  ev also within the upper thick part of the hvpe gan .",
    "however , the spatial distribution of the emission at this energy differs significantly from the one of the region at the bottom of the hvpe gan , and , in contrast to the sf emission , comes from an area also showing dx emission , thus indicating a different origin of this emission .",
    "we clearly observe large v - shaped and small column - like contrasts of the cl mapping throughout the upper and lower regions of the layer , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] displays a magnified cl image of the lower part of the cross - section of sample s1 for a detection energy @xmath29  ev . at the bottom",
    ", the low-@xmath1 hvpe gan shows cl features , which are arranged in columns and are elongated along the basal plane .",
    "the latter observation supports the assignment of this emission to sf - related luminescence . directly from the interface to the low-@xmath1 hvpe gan , the cl map of the high-@xmath1 hvpe gan is characterized by v - shaped features as indicated by dashed lines .",
    "specifically , the apex of these features originates at the boundary between two of the columns situated beneath .",
    "as described recently by lee @xmath9 , @xcite v - shaped intensity distributions in cl maps of the cross - section of thick hvpe gan layers are caused by the evolution of @xmath30 facets initiated by threading dislocations .",
    "these facets , which form the observed v - pits , are nitrogen - terminated and promote the incorporation of oxygen atoms during growth .",
    "@xcite since oxygen atoms give rise to a donor level with a donor - to - valence band transition at about 3.42  ev @xcite , the near - band edge cl line of the upper region of s1 is broadened toward the low - energy side , and the motion of the growth front of the @xmath30 facets can be clearly imaged for @xmath29",

    "a columnar growth occurs with a mean column diameter of about 0.3  @xmath0 m . at the very",
    "beginning of the subsequent high-@xmath1 hvpe step , v - pits evolve , the growth dynamics of which are governed by facet growth leading to an increase of the concentration of incorporated impurity atoms such as oxygen .",
    "figures  [ fig6](a ) and 6(b ) show cl images of identical regions from the cross - section of sample s2 for cl detection energies of @xmath28 and 3.425  ev , respectively .",
    "again , we observe two distinct parts of the hvpe gan representing the hvpe grown at low @xmath1 and high @xmath1 , where the optical emission of the former is related to basal plane sfs , while the emission of the latter is related to the donor - bound exciton in gan . moreover , the cl distribution mapped at 3.425  ev is very weak throughout the whole upper part of the hvpe gan and does not show any significant features such as v - shaped patterns . an enlarged section of the superposition of the cl maps of figures  [ fig6](a ) and 6(b ) is shown in figure  [ fig6](c ) for a direct correlation . in the lower part of figure  [ fig6](c ) , the cl intensity forms stripe segments oriented along the basal plane confirming again their basal plane sf - related origin .",
    "these stripe segments are arranged within columns with an average diameter of 2  @xmath0 m , the borders of which are continued within the upper part of figure  [ fig6](c ) ( cf . dashed arrows ) indicating a columnar growth of the gan along the @xmath2-direction during the high-@xmath1 hvpe step .",
    "some of the dark border lines are disappearing along the growth direction due to coalescence of neighboring columns .",
    "we do not observe any indication of the evolution of @xmath30 or other slowly growing facets , i. e. , of a v - pit - like growth at this stage of the epitaxy .",
    "nevertheless , v - pits are also present at the surface of s2 as visible in figure  [ fig6](a ) and shown in figure  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "these v - pits were , however , formed within a region close to the surface , where either a bundle of or single dark - line defects are found at their apex as shown in the cl image of figure  [ fig7 ] .",

    "the indicated angle corresponds to the @xmath30 facet of wurtzite gan.,width=264 ]    comparing the above discussed cl data of s1 and s2 , we assume that the different morphology of the underlying mbe - grown nanostructure ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ) , where the density of the nanowalls of s1 is much higher than the density of nws or nanoleafs of s2 , resulted in a columnar growth with very different mean column diameters ( 0.3  @xmath0 m for s1 and 2  @xmath0 m for s2 ) during the low-@xmath1 hvpe step . according to kwon @xmath32 @xmath33 @xcite , a larger distance of the nanostructures serving as the template for a hvpe overgrowth promotes a lateral epitaxy and therefore results in larger grains during the first hvpe step .",
    "the very different mean column diameters formed during the low-@xmath1 hvpe step resulted in a different growth dynamics for s1 and s2 during the subsequent high-@xmath1 hvpe step . while in the case of s1 , a @xmath30 faceted growth dominates , we observe a columnar growth along the @xmath2-direction throughout the whole gan layer for s2 .      for the reference sample s3 ,",
    "the cl distribution of the cross - section differs significantly from the ones of s1 and s2 . in figure  [ fig8](a ) , the cross - section cl image of s3 obtained for @xmath28  ev shows near - band gap optical emission throughout the whole thickness without a clear distinction between the low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 hvpe growth regions .",

    "the latter could serve as fast diffusion paths for si @xcite leading to a local incorporation of silicon into the gan layer on a strong dopant level .",
    "a silicon concentration on a dopant level can not yet be detected by edx and is probably not a result of a silicon - melt - back etching , which usually leads to a much higher silicon content .",
    "we suppose that due to the hvpe growth directly on top of the uncovered aln buffer layer , a locally high silicon doping of the gan takes place leading to a broad and blue - shifted optical emission spectrum , which we have also observed for aln buffer layers as thick as 200  nm for a 6 hours lasting hvpe process at 800  @xmath10c .",
    "the appearance of sf - related cl features just above this interface region could also be a signature of a strong silicon doping .",
    "@xcite      in figure  [ fig9 ] , we compare the cl spectra excited at the upper part of the cross - sections of s1 to s3 at room temperature .",
    "s1 shows the highest cl intensity , but also the largest linewidth ( fwhm@xmath37  mev ) .",
    "both the higher intensity and the larger fwhm are probably a result of doping due to a growth controlled by @xmath30 or other slowly growing facets .",
    "the maximum cl intensity of s2 is about 10@xmath5 lower than the one of s1 , whereas the linewidth of the spectrum is significantly smaller ( fwhm@xmath38  mev ) and is close to the linewidth of a corresponding spectrum obtained from a fs - gan substrate , which exhibits a dislocation density as low as @xmath39  @xmath4 .",
    "the linewidth of the cl spectrum of s3 is equal to the one of s2 , but the cl intensity is about 60@xmath5 lower than that of s2 , which is probably due to a higher density of dark - line defects in s3 as compared with s2 .",
    "this difference in the dark - line density can hardly be quantified by means of the cl maps shown in figures .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig8 ] , but can be indirectly concluded by comparing the v - pit density at the surface , which amounts to @xmath40  @xmath4 for s2 and @xmath41  @xmath4 for s3 ( cf .",

    "s2 with the ones of s3 , we can conclude that the hvpe of gan on silicon covered by gan nanostructures in addition to an aln buffer layer can prevent the incorporation of silicon and results in a higher luminescence efficiency of the hvpe gan as compared with the growth directly on top of an aln buffer layer .",
    "moreover , the template of s2 is more suitable for an undisturbed growth along the @xmath2-direction , which in turn prevents an undesired incorporation of impurity atoms at the growth front .      the conclusion drawn above encouraged us to try a deposition of several 100  @xmath0 m gan using the same template and growth parameters as for s2 , but adding a 6 hours long high-@xmath1 hvpe step at 1063  @xmath10c . as a result",

    ", the silicon substrate was self - separated from the hvpe layer .",
    "however , the surface of s4 is apparently rough , and the lower region of the hvpe layer shows a dark contrast in the sem image . as checked by edx , this dark part of the hvpe layer is not any more gan , but a mixture of ga , n , and silicon .",
    "moreover , the cl maps of figures  [ fig10](b ) and 10(c ) obtained from an ion - polished region of the cross - section of s4 indicate that the upper , several 100  @xmath0 m thick",
    "gan does not exhibit a single , but a polycrystalline structure consisting of several 10 to 100  @xmath0 m large crystals .",
    "the bright stripes visible in the cl map of figure  [ fig10](c ) , which are complementary to the luminescence in figure  [ fig10](b ) , correspond to luminescence of excitons bound to i@xmath26-type basal plane sfs and are therefore oriented perpendicular to the @xmath2-direction .",
    "consequently , the @xmath2-axies of the grains , which can be recognized in the cl maps , are tilted to each other by several degrees .",
    "the inset of figure  [ fig11 ] shows a large polished piece of s4 , whereas the main graph depicts the room temperature cl spectra of this polished piece and the one of the mentioned fs - gan sample .",
    "both the intensity and the linewidth of the near - band edge cl of s4 are similar to the ones of the fs - gan sample , where the fwhm amounts to 75  mev . the cl intensity at the spectral range of the `` yellow luminescence '' ( centered at about 2.3  ev ) is more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the near - band edge cl , and therefore , as low as for the fs - gan .",
    "the only significant difference between the two spectra is the appearance of a weak , broad band in the spectrum of s4 centered at about 2.9  ev .",
    "the origin of this luminescence band is most probably associated with the presence of a high density of sfs and possibly cubic segments as visible in the low - temperature cl map of the cross - section of s4 in figure  [ fig10](c ) .",
    "using a two - step hvpe process , we have grown several ten  @xmath0 m thick gan layers on si(111 ) substrates covered by an aln buffer as protection layer , both without and with additional gan nanostructures as nucleation sites .",
    "a 15  nm thick aln buffer layer in combination with a low-@xmath1 hvpe step at 800  @xmath10c can successfully suppress a silicon - melt - back etching .",
    "the gan layer deposited directly on the aln buffer by hvpe without mbe - grown gan nanostructures shows a significant broadening and blue - shift of the luminescence spectrum , when excited close to the aln / gan interface , which indicates a strong doping of the interface region due to silicon incorporation via fast diffusion paths provided by grain boundaries of the aln buffer . when additional gan nanostructures are deposited by mbe on the aln buffer , the nucleation and growth during the subsequent low-@xmath1 hvpe step results in a columnar growth of the gan , where the column diameter is controlled by the morphology of the nanostructure .",
    "due to the relatively low growth temperature as well as to the lateral growth after nucleation , the gan layer region of the low-@xmath1 hvpe step contains a high density of stacking faults , which are no longer present within the region of the high-@xmath1 hvpe growth . when the diameters of the columns formed during the low-@xmath1 hvpe step amount to a few 100  nm , the growth dynamics of the subsequent high-@xmath1 hvpe step is characterized by the formation of v - pits at a very early stage , which in turn is associated with an incorporation of impurity atoms . for diameters of the columns formed during the low-@xmath1 hvpe step on the order of a few @xmath0 m ,",
    "the growth dynamics of the subsequent high-@xmath1 hvpe step is characterized by straight columnar growth along the @xmath2-axis throughout the whole gan layer .",
    "room temperature luminescence spectra of such gan layers are very similar to spectra obtained from fs - gan with respect to both intensity and fwhm .",
    "a several hours long high-@xmath1 hvpe step resulted in several hundred  @xmath0 m thick gan layers , which show , however , a silicon contamination at their bottom part , a high density of sfs throughout the whole layer , and a polycrystalline structure .",
    "our future research will be focused on the origin of the silicon incorporation during a long - time , high-@xmath1 hvpe process and the necessary template structure as well as growth parameters to prevent the reaction of silicon with the hvpe gan .",
    "we thank oliver brandt for fruitful discussions and raffaella calarco as well as holger t. grahn for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "moreover , we thank o. romanyuk for the investigation of the polarity of the hvpe gan by photoelectron diffraction and we gratefully acknowledge financial support of this work by the sino - german center for science promotion through the project gz 736 ."
