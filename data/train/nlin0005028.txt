    "@xcite to the case of a single quadratic nonlinear layer embedded into a periodic linear medium , and describe a number of new features of the localized modes that appear due to a bandgap structure .",
    "first , we discuss the physical motivation for our model .",
    "let us consider an interface between two semi - infinite bulk optical media with inversion symmetry .",
    "the interface layer breaks the symmetry and therefore it should possess a nonvanishing surface quadratic response  @xcite that can be enhanced by a proper coating creating a nonlinear layer with quadratic nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "such a layer corresponds to an effective nonlinear defect that can support photonic modes localized at the interface .",
    "there exists a strong experimental evidence of shg in such type of localized photonic modes .",
    "for example , recent experimental results  @xcite reported shg in periodic photonic band - gap structures with embedded nonlinear defect layers .",
    "an enhancement of the parametric interaction in the vicinity of the defects was observed , suggesting that shg occurs in localized modes , being suppressed for propagating modes .",
    "the surface nature of shg was confirmed by comparison of experimental data and results of direct numerical simulations  @xcite .    to introduce an analytically solvable model for shg in localized waves ,",
    "we follow ref .  @xcite and consider a fundamental frequency ( ff ) wave propagating along the @xmath1-direction in a linear slab waveguide , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] .",
    "we assume that the interfaces ( or _ defect layers _ ) possess a quadratic nonlinear response , so that a ff wave can parametrically couple to its second harmonic ( sh ) wave .",

    "on the other hand , to make the parametric interaction effective , the mismatch between the phase velocities of the ff and sh waves should be small , @xmath24 .",

    "the fundamental properties of npc can be understood by studying _ nonlinear localized modes_. such modes appear in the frequency gap of the layered linear structure , and they can be called _ discrete gap solitons _ or , in a broader context , _ intrinsic localized modes _  @xcite .    we search for solutions of eqs .",

    "thus , we develop a more complete analytical description of discrete gap solitons , which can predict their properties in all the parameter regions .    in order to find approximate solutions for highly localized modes , we use the variational method .",

    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are determined by minimizing the lagrangian corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dchi2 ] ) .",
    "details of these calculations will be presented elsewhere  @xcite , here we give a brief summary of the main results , and discuss their physical consequences .    as the system ( [ eq : dchi2 ] )",
    "possesses the symmetries ( i )  @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and ( ii )  @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we consider , without a lack of generality , the case @xmath90 .",
    "the analysis shows that localized solutions exist only if @xmath91 .",
    "the latter condition means that the ff component is _ unstaggered _ for @xmath92 , and _ staggered _ , otherwise ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "similarly , we consider only the case @xmath94 , as for other values the localized solutions are unstable due to resonant interaction with linear waves  @xcite .    analyzing the linear problem , it is straightforward to see that the sh mode can be staggered only if @xmath95 .",
    "then , we distinguish between two limits : ( i )  a strongly localized ff mode ( @xmath96 ) , when the sh consists of staggered linear tails  @xcite , and ( ii )  the cascading limit ( @xmath97 ) , when the sh profile is unstaggered and can be found as @xmath98 , resulting in an effectively cubic nonlinearity for the ff wave  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in the intermediate case , a transition of the sh profile between staggered and unstaggered topologies should be observed .",
    "indeed , our variational calculations predict that the sh is staggered for @xmath99 , and unstaggered for @xmath100 . here , the critical parameter value depends on @xmath101 : for odd modes , it is found from the quadratic equation , @xmath102 , and a similar relation holds for even modes @xmath103 .",
    "the topology does not change sharply as the parameter @xmath104 crosses the critical value @xmath105 , but numerical calculations confirm that such a transition occurs in a region close to the separation line .",
    "we performed numerical analysis and found that the approximate variational solutions provide close matching for the highly localized profiles , i.e. for relatively large values of @xmath106 .",
    "examples of odd and even modes are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : odd ] and [ fig : even ] , respectively .",
    "we see that the profiles of staggered modes , supported by only a few interfaces , are described very accurately .",
    "however , for wider modes the deviations between the exact numerical and variational solutions are more pronounced , see figs .",
    "[ fig : odd](c ) and [ fig : even](c ) .",
    "the limitation of the variational solution is due to the specific choice of the trial functions  ( [ eq : testf_odd]),([eq : testf_even ] ) , which are not suitable for description of `` moderately '' localized waves with smoother profiles .",
    "it can be demonstrated that in the continuum limit untwisted modes acquire the profiles of quadratic solitons  @xcite , that can be well approximated with the @xmath107-type functions  @xcite . a special _ quasi - continuous approach _ , which allows to determine the mode profiles as a soliton bound state can also be developed .",
    "the resulting approximate solutions provide very good estimates , and they are very useful for understanding the mode scaling properties , i.e. a change from broad solitons to narrow highly localized states . on the other hand , it should be noted that the twisted modes do not exist close to the continuum limit , because their profiles are intrinsically discrete due to a sharp amplitude change between the layers at the mode center .",
    "a comprehensive description of these results goes beyond the scope of the present paper , and will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a special situation , when there exists only a single nonlinear layer located at embedded into a linear grating . a similar problem has been considered in our recent paper  @xcite for the case when the linear media on both sides of the nonlinear interface are uniform . here , we generalize those results to the case of non - uniform linear media , considering a nonlinear layer with quadratic nonlinearity embedded into a periodic structure .",
    "therefore , we modify the model  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) as follows : ( i )  nonlinear coupling terms are taken into account only for @xmath108 , and ( ii )  a linear response of the central layer is assumed to be different from that of other layers , i.e. we change @xmath109 at @xmath108 . in connection with the previous problem ( see secs .",
    "[ sect : model ] and  [ sect : period ] ) , the case with @xmath110 corresponds to the limit of a highly localized mode , when the mode width is much smaller than the distance in between the nonlinear layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bragg ] ) .",
    "following the general approach outlined in the previous section , we first analyze the linear properties .",
    "we also use the similar notations , but for a single nonlinear interface we omit the index @xmath108 . from the theory of linear structures , it follows that a link between the linear - wave amplitudes can be characterized by the reflection coefficients , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . we do not assume that the linear structure is symmetric [ in general @xmath113 and denote with @xmath77 and @xmath78 the wave characteristics at the right and left boundaries of the nonlinear layer .",

    "quite remarkably , the corresponding mode properties are very similar to those of _ quadratic solitons _  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for large values of the propagation constant @xmath134 the power dependence @xmath139 always has a positive slope , while for smaller @xmath134 the slope can be negative , resulting in _ bistability_. such a case is demonstrated in fig .",

    "in order to demonstrate some features of linear modes existing in periodic structures , we consider the properties of the corresponding transfer matrices . first , we see that a matrix describing changes of the wave amplitudes at the boundary between linear layers , @xmath143 , depends only on the wave numbers on either side of the interface , as follows from eq .",

    "it is also easy to check that the following relation holds : @xmath144 { \\displaystyle \\qquad \\qquad        t_{\\rm r}(\\mu_{j , m+1},\\tilde{\\mu } ) \\ ;        t_{\\rm r}(\\tilde{\\mu},\\mu_{j , m } ) ,     } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is arbitrary , and we assume that it is real .",

    ". it can be verified by direct substitution that these matrices are real ( we use the fact that , for stationary modes , @xmath150 are real or purely imaginary ) , and therefore @xmath151 is real as well . finally , we find that @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which proves that coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath67 in eq .",
