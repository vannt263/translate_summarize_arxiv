    "the physics of hadrons , studied with electron scattering , is an active research field : jefferson lab is completing its successful program using a 6-gev cebaf accelerator and is preparing a 12-gev upgrade to start a new physics program within the next several years @xcite .",
    "electron - scattering experiments probing the structure of hadrons also continue at the mami and elsa facilities in germany .",
    "a common feature of the modern experiments that study electromagnetic structure of hadrons is their high precision .",
    "the increased accuracy of the measurements put stringent requirements on qed radiative corrections that must be applied to the data .",
    "the largest qed corrections arise from bremsstrahlung , @xmath0 the emission of real photons by the electrons .",
    "the bremsstrahlung corrections are characterized by large logarithms of the type @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is transferred 4-momentum and @xmath3 is electron mass , resulting in an order - of - magnitude enhancement of @xmath4 effects .",
    "systematic uncertainties due to the bremsstrahlung corrections can be minimized by using iterative procedures and without requiring additional knowledge of hadronic structure . however ,",
    "when the experiments reach accuracy at a percent level , their interpretation also becomes sensitive to box - type contributions described by two - photon ( 2@xmath5 ) exchange .",
    "a good example of the importance of @xmath6-exchange corrections is the rosenbluth separation experiments in elastic electron - proton scattering @xcite . in these experiments",
    ", the measured rosenbluth slope may be misinterpreted due to the omission of the angular dependence of @xmath6 corrections in the data analysis , which can mimic a significant part of the electric form factor contribution to the cross section .    in this paper , we evaluate @xmath6-exchange effects for the processes of exclusive pion electroproduction @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these processes have been studied experimentally in great detail and have become a valuable source of information on the electromagnetic structure of nucleons .",
    "for example , depending on the choice of kinematics , they provide access to the electromagnetic transition amplitudes from the nucleon ground state to excited states @xcite ; or @xmath9-dependence of the pion electromagnetic form factor @xcite ; or , in a deep - virtual regime , polarization - dependent generalized parton distributions of a nucleon @xcite .",
    "the qed radiative corrections are indispensable in the interpretation of the experimental data on electron scattering .",
    "although significant theoretical effort has been dedicated to this problem , more work still needs to be done . a classical approach developed by four decades ago",
    "was mainly intended for inclusive and elastic electron scattering , assuming integration over the phase space of final hadrons .",
    "more recent work addressed the case of electroproduction with detection of hadrons in the final state for semi - inclusive @xcite and exclusive diffractive @xcite processes .",
    "a calculation of qed corrections to exclusive electroproduction of pions by @xcite provided the next - to - leading order qed radiative corrections to the cross section and the beam polarization asymmetry for exclusive pion electroproduction . in comparison to earlier work , the authors of ref.@xcite ( a ) eliminated dependence on a nonphysical parameter coming from splitting soft and hard regions of the phase space of radiated photons by covariant treatment of an infrared divergence using the method of @xcite , ( b ) treated bremsstrahlung exactly , without applying either the soft photon or peaking approximations and ( c ) retained the effects arising from the kinematics of detection in coincidence of two particles , an electron and a hadron , in the final state . however , the calculation of @xcite only included vacuum polarization corrections and contributions from bremsstrahlung and vertex corrections from the electron .",
    "no box diagrams with two - photon exchange or photon emission from hadrons were considered .    motivated by the need to evaluate two - photon exchange for measurements of the pion form factor , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite extended their approach to elastic electron - proton scattering ( outlined in @xcite ) to calculate two - photon exchange corrections in the elastic electron - pion scattering , including only pion elastic intermediate states .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered a process of @xmath10 elastic scattering as well .",
    "both these papers , @xcite and @xcite , concluded that the two - photon exchange plays a sizable role in the pion form factor measurements at extreme backward angles . in @xcite ,",
    "the two - photon exchange amplitude for the elastic electron - pion scattering was computed in the dispersion approach and with the monopole parameterization of the pion form factor , including both elastic and inelastic contributions .",
    "all the previous calculations of 2@xmath5-exchange for pion form factor measurements treated the pion as a stable and free particle at rest , which complicates the application of this correction to actual measurements .    in the work presented here ,",
    "we calculate the two - photon box corrections for the cross sections of the entire process of pion electroproduction on a nucleon for two production channels ,    @xmath11    where in the final state an electron and a charged hadron are detected , @xmath12 or the proton .",
    "the calculations are performed both analytically and numerically using _ feynarts _ and _ formcalc _ @xcite as the base languages .",
    "the regularization of infrared divergences arising in the box diagrams is addressed by giving the photon a small rest mass and canceling that by adding the soft - photon bremsstrahlung contribution from the electron , proton , and the charged pion .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows : in section ii , we derive formulae for 2@xmath5 corrections to pion electroproduction amplitudes .",
    "section iii describes the soft - photon bremsstrahlung contribution required for cancellation of infrared divergences .",
    "section iv provides the analytical results .",
    "numerical analysis is performed in section v , and the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "our goal is to derive the radiative correction associated with the two - photon box diagrams in exclusive pion electroproduction . here , we choose to employ , compare and analyze two approaches .",
    "the first approach is based on the soft - photon approximation , where we follow two prescriptions . in the first prescription , we apply the soft - photon approximation in the box amplitude consistently in the numerator and denominator algebra according to the method suggested by tsai @xcite . in this paper , we will call this type of soft - photon treatment of the box amplitude spt ( soft - photon - tsai ) .",
    "the second prescription is based on the work of maximon and tjon @xcite , where the soft - photon approximation is applied only in the numerator algebra .",
    "accordingly , we will refer to this prescription as spmt ( soft - photon - maximon - tjon ) . in the second approach ,",
    "we evaluate the box amplitude exactly , without relying on the soft - photon approximation .",
    "since in this case the box amplitude can not be factorized by the born amplitude , this approach will result in the model dependence of the radiative correction . here , we evaluate the box amplitude by employing the model with the monopole form - factor in the photon - proton , photon - pion and pion photoproduction couplings .",
    "we will refer to this approach as fm ( formfactor - model ) .",
    "the two - photon box diagrams in exclusive pion electroproduction are given in fig.([flo : feynman_diag ] ) .",
    "for the incoming electron and proton , we have momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for the outgoing electron , detected proton ( or pion : @xmath15 ) and",
    "undetected neutron ( or pion : @xmath16 ) we have momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "let us start with the definitions of the input kinematic parameters .",
    "we choose to use the incoming electron energy in the laboratory frame @xmath19 , the momentum transfer @xmath20 and the invariant mass of the virtual photon plus incoming proton @xmath21 as input parameters .",
    "in addition , the polar ( @xmath22 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath23 ) angles of the detected proton ( pion ) are defined in the center of mass of the final hadrons .",
    "the extended set of lorentz invariants is defined according to the prescription of @xcite . @xmath24 with the help of the invariants in eq.([eq : kin1 ] ) , we define energy and momenta in the center of mass system of the virtual photon @xmath25 and initial proton as follows :    & e_1,3= , p_1,3= , +   + & e_2= , p_2=p_q=,[eq : kin2 ] +   + & e_4= , p_4=.    the angles @xmath26 are given by the following expressions :    & _ 1,3=,[eq : kin3 ] +   + & _",

    "the soft - photon approximation significantly simplifies the calculations of the two - photon box amplitudes .",
    "specifically , a photon which does not couple to the pion photoproduction vertex is treated as a soft one .",
    "this implies that we extract only the infrared - divergent part of the amplitude and , for now , we assume that the non - infrared - divergent part of the amplitude gives a negligible contribution .",
    "the infrared divergences arising in the cross section from the two - photon box diagrams will be treated later using soft - photon bremsstrahlung .    as an example ,",
    "let us start with the first graph on fig.([flo : feynman_diag](a ) ) .",

    "when the soft - photon approximation is applied , the photon - pion coupling becomes @xmath50 and hence the box amplitude will have the same general structure as for the case of @xmath16 electroproduction .",
