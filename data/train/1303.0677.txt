    "the idea that spontaneous breaking of symmetries gives rise to phase transitions plays an important role in our understanding of phase transitions in statistical physics , particle physics and even computer science .",
    "a canonical model for understanding the breaking of @xmath0-fold symmetries is the @xmath0-state potts model @xcite , whose hamiltonian for uniform ferromagnetic couplings may be written as @xmath7 where the interactions are along the edges @xmath8 of some graph , the spins @xmath9 at each vertex may take @xmath0 values and @xmath10 is the kronecker delta . with this hamiltonian like",
    "spins interact with one strength and unlike spins with a different strength . as is well known the phase transition for the potts model in two dimensions is continuous , i.e. second order , if @xmath11 and first order for larger @xmath0 .",
    "it is generally expected that a phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath0-fold symmetry in two dimensions will have the same order as the ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model , but recent studies have suggested this is by no means always the case @xcite .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that one possible mechanism giving rise to such non - canonical orders for phase transitions might be the presence of `` invisible '' states which did not contribute to the internal energy but still contributed to the entropy .",
    "it is possible to write down a potts hamiltonian that incorporates such states as @xmath12 which has @xmath0 visible states and @xmath6 invisible states for each spin @xmath13 . in the sequel",
    "we will denote this as the ( @xmath0,@xmath6)-state potts model .",
    "a useful way to rewrite this hamiltonian is to introduce new spin variables @xmath9",
    "where @xmath14 if @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise @xcite .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian @xmath17 contains a temperature dependent field term which gives the entropy contribution of the invisible states and the additional kronecker deltas in the first interaction term ensure the invisible states do not contribute to the internal energy .    in the case of a potts model with @xmath5 visible states and @xmath6 invisible states",
    "we may map this hamiltonian in turn to that of a spin one model , the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) @xcite model with equal couplings @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the generic beg model admits non - equal couplings for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms , but this is unnecessary for our purposes .",
    "the phase diagram for the beg model has been studied by numerous authors using various means . in @xcite",
    "a bragg - williams mean - field approximation was used , giving a phase diagram whose general form is shown in fig.(1 )     plane .",
    "the second order transition line is shown in bold and the first order dashed .",
    "the arrowed sloping lines ( a ) , ( b ) represent different values of @xmath6 when @xmath19 to make contact with the ( @xmath5,@xmath6)-state potts model .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=188 ] [ beggraph ]    where a magnetized phase exists in the small @xmath22 region .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is usually called the crystal field as a consequence of the model s phenomenological roots .    the mechanism by which the invisible states may affect the order of the transition is clear from the diagram . for smaller @xmath6 as @xmath24 is increased the system will move along a line similar to the the lower of the two sloping lines ( since @xmath19 ) , which we have denoted by ( a ) in fig.(1 ) .",
    "it will thus cross the second order portion of the phase transition line . for sufficiently large @xmath6",
    "the line is steep enough to cross the first order portion of the transition line , as shown in ( b ) .",
    "quantitatively , a second order transition occurs if @xmath25 and the transition becomes first order for larger @xmath6 .",
    "the existence of the low temperature symmetry broken phase and first order transition for the ( @xmath0,@xmath6)-state model has also been shown rigorously using random cluster methods in @xcite for @xmath26 and sufficiently large @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we employ another mean - field like model to study the @xmath27 state potts model by making use of the fact that spin models on regular random graphs ( random graphs where each vertex has the same valency ) will generically display mean - field behaviour since such graphs look locally like a bethe lattice @xcite . unlike the bethe lattice regular random graphs _ do _ have large loops @xcite , which renders them closed and obviates the need to deal with boundary conditions , as one must for the bethe lattice proper .",
    "the weightings to use for spin models living on such graphs can be determined by using similar methods to those used for `` fat '' random graphs , where the perturbative expansion of matrix integrals over @xmath28 matrices in the limit @xmath29 give planar random graphs decorated with the appropriate boltzmann weights .",
    "the regular random graphs considered here are generated in the @xmath30 , scalar limit of such integrals @xcite so we denote them as `` thin '' random graphs .",
    "the required ensemble of random graphs can be generated from the feynman diagram expansion of a scalar integral .",
    "for instance , if we are simply interested in calculating the number of undecorated 3-regular random graphs with @xmath31 vertices we could evaluate the integral @xmath32 which generates the graphs in a perturbative expansion with a unit propagator from the @xmath33 term tying together the cubic vertices from the @xmath34 term .",
    "the contour integral in @xmath35 picks out the desired size of graph .",
    "expanding the cubic terms in the exponential and evaluating the gaussian integrals gives the well known result @xmath36 for the number of @xmath3-regular random graphs with @xmath31 vertices .",
    "when the graphs are decorated with spins we introduce additional variables in the integral to give the desired weights to edge interactions . for the ising model , for example , the hamiltonian on any graph is @xmath37 where the sum is over the edges connecting nearest neighbour sites .",
    "the partition function @xmath38 for the ising model on an ensemble of thin graphs with @xmath31 vertices is then given by the integral @xcite @xmath39 where the propagator @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 and the integrand , which we shall call an `` action '' since we are thinking in terms of feynman diagrams , is @xmath43 inverting the propagator gives the correct ising interactions between the two spin states , which are proxied by the two variables @xmath44 in the integral .",
    "the approach extends naturally to other spin models , such as the q - state potts models where we may take an action of the form @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 and calculate the equivalent of equ.([znising ] ) with the @xmath0 variables @xmath47 .",
    "the potts transition is found to be first order for @xmath48 , as one might expect for a mean - field model .",
    "to evaluate such spin model partition functions on thin graphs in the thermodynamic limit we can employ saddle point methods , in which case the vertex coupling @xmath35 may be scaled out and we obtain the leading term by simply solving the saddle point equations for the action : @xmath49 .",
    "phase transitions occur when the free energies , given to leading order by @xmath50 itself , of the different solution branches cross over as the temperature or other parameters are varied .",
    "using saddle point calculations for the thin graphs gives a straightforward approach to mean - field theory for spin models in general and it has been possible to show that the saddle point equations for the thin graph actions may be transformed into the fixed point equations of the recursion relations @xcite used to solve various spin models on bethe lattices .",
    "the appropriate @xmath50 for the beg model on thin ( or indeed fat ) graphs is straightforward to write down @xcite , even for the more general case of a beg model with unequal couplings where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath51 since this is a spin one model , we employ three variables in @xmath52 @xmath53 where the couplings in the action @xmath52 are related to those in the hamiltonian by @xmath54 \\left [ b + a^2 ( 1 - b)^2 \\right ] } \\\\ a^3 \\ , \\exp ( \\beta \\mu ) & = & \\delta \\nonumber \\label{begrels}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as can been seen by inverting the quadratic terms in @xmath52 to obtain the propagator and demanding that the edge weights for the different spin configurations match those generated by the hamiltonian of equ.([beg2 ] ) .    for the purposes of investigating the @xmath27 state potts model it is sufficient to take @xmath55 , which means @xmath52 simplifies to @xmath56 since @xmath57 when @xmath55 the relation between the hamiltonian couplings and those in @xmath52 also simplifies to @xmath58 inverting the first of these we obtain the relation between the coupling @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 so the physical range of @xmath59 is given by @xmath62 .",
    "with the expression for @xmath52 in hand , the saddle point equations for the model are given by @xmath63 and these may then be used to obtain the phase diagram .",
    "the propagator in @xmath52 has a canonical form with unit coefficients for each of the quadratic terms in equ.([sbeg],[sbegeq ] ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath64 vertices must pick up an extra @xmath65 coefficient to give the correct boltzmann weights for edges with @xmath66 spins .",
    "this manifests itself in the relation between @xmath67 and and the crystal field coupling @xmath23 in the original hamiltonian in equs.([begrels],[begrels2 ] ) . an alternative would be to scale @xmath68 to shift all this dependence to the propagator",
    "we have belaboured this point because the relation between @xmath23 ( in the beg spin model hamiltonian ) and @xmath67 ( in the random graph action ) determines the number of invisible states @xmath6 via @xmath19 in equ.([begrels2 ] ) @xmath69 when we think of the beg model as a representation of the ( @xmath70)-state potts model .    perhaps the most direct way to see",
    "the phase structure of the model is to evaluate the magnetization along appropriate slices of the two - dimensional phase diagram shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the natural choice of variables for @xmath52 is given by @xmath71 , which we can translate back to @xmath72 as appropriate .",
    "the magnetization @xmath73 of a saddle point solution may be calculated by substituting the saddle point values of @xmath74 into @xmath75 which counts the number of @xmath76 vertices minus the number of @xmath77 vertices , normalized by the total number of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 vertices .",
    "the saddle point values of @xmath74 may also be substituted into @xmath52 itself to obtain the free energy .",
    "the explicit expressions of the saddle point values of @xmath74 are not particularly illuminating : there are two families of non - trivial solutions , one with @xmath79 corresponding to a magnetized state and one with @xmath80 corresponding to an un - magnetized state .",
    "there is also a trivial solution with @xmath81 .",
    "the expression for the saddle point action @xmath82 in the case of the magnetized solution(s ) is , however , quite simple @xmath83 and makes it clear that we might expect critical behaviour ( at least ) along the curve @xmath84 .",
    "the saddle point magnetization also confirms this since it is given along the various branches by @xmath85    to scan the phase diagram it is convenient to evaluate the magnetization @xmath73 at fixed @xmath59 as @xmath67 is varied . in fig.(2 )",
    "we have taken @xmath86 ( i.e. a low temperature value ) and plotted all the non - zero branches of the magnetization against @xmath67 .     at @xmath86 ( i.e. _ low _",
    "temperature),title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] [ m_a_small ]    the branching values at the tips of the prongs are at @xmath87 , confirming that @xmath88 . as @xmath67 is reduced at fixed @xmath59 ( which also corresponds to the crystal field @xmath23 decreasing ) the magnetization will jump at @xmath89 since the internal branches of the prong have a higher free energy , signalling a first order transition .    as @xmath59",
    "is increased the tips of the prong move in towards the horizontal axis and by @xmath90 they have coalesced as shown in fig.(3 )     at @xmath90 which lies just above the triple point value of @xmath91,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] [ m_a_big ]    which gives a picture that is typical of a second order transition .",
    "we can pinpoint the triple point value @xmath92 where the prongs coalesce and the transition becomes second order by substituting the equation for the first order critical line @xmath93 into the saddle point magnetizations to get the magnetization at @xmath94 , giving expressions of the form @xmath95 which show that @xmath96 at the triple point value , @xmath97 with @xmath98 .    on the second order transition line the critical value of @xmath67 decreases as @xmath59 is increased , as can be seen from the full expression for the non - zero branches of @xmath73 in equ.([fullm ] ) above @xmath99 where the physical solutions for the second order branches are given by choosing the upper signs for the various square roots in equ.([fullm ] ) .",
    "as @xmath100 the critical value of @xmath67 tends to zero and no magnetized solution exists for the remainder of the physical range @xmath101 .    remembering that increasing @xmath59 corresponds to increasing @xmath24 the general picture presented from the thin graph saddle point calculation is thus perfectly consistent with that observed from the bragg - williams mean - field approach shown in fig.(1 ) . for @xmath102",
    "first order transitions are observed as @xmath67 is varied , whereas between @xmath103 second order transitions are observed with the critical value of @xmath67 decreasing with increasing @xmath59 ( i.e. increasing temperature ) . for @xmath104 on the other hand , there is no transition .",
    "having obtained the phase diagram of the beg model on thin @xmath105 graphs we are now in a position to re - interpret it as the phase diagram of a ( @xmath5,@xmath6)-state potts model on the same graphs .",
    "the key equation here is equ.([a3r ] ) which states the relation between the number of invisible states and the parameters in @xmath52 , namely @xmath106 .",
    "the key values to insert in this are those of the triple point where the transition changes from being second to first order , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , so we find that @xmath6 at this point has the surprisingly large value of 16 .    in summary , on @xmath3-regular random graphs",
    "the ( @xmath5,@xmath6)-state potts model requires 17 or more invisible states to transmute the second order transition displayed by the @xmath5-state potts ( ising ) model on such graphs into a first order transition .",
    "curiously , another mechanism for changing the order of a phase transition discussed by tanaka and tamura in @xcite , the wajnflasz - pick model @xcite , bears a close relation to the behaviour of the standard potts model ( with no invisible states ) on thin graphs @xcite .",
    "the wajnflasz - pick hamiltonian is ising - like , but there are @xmath109 positive spin states and @xmath110 negative spin states @xmath111 this hamiltonian can be transformed to a standard ising hamiltonian in a shifted temperature dependent external field @xcite",
    "@xmath112     phase diagram for the wajnflasz - pick model .",
    "the trajectory of the system at fixed external field @xmath113 as @xmath24 is increased is plotted for three ratios of @xmath109 to @xmath110.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] [ wp ]    we can see in fig.(4 ) that changing the temperature at a fixed external field @xmath113 will take the system along a line with no transition , a second order transition ( if it goes through @xmath114 ) or a a first order transition depending on the ratio @xmath115    we now consider the standard q - state potts model where the hamiltonian is that given in equ.([potts1 ] ) @xmath116 on thin graphs the potts models display the mean - field behaviour of a continuous transition for @xmath117 and first order transitions for @xmath118 .",
    "the model on @xmath3-regular thin graphs is described by the action of equ.([qstate ] ) , also repeated here for convenience , @xmath119 and one finds a high temperature saddle - point solution of the form @xmath120 bifurcating to a broken symmetry solution @xmath121 at @xmath122 where , as before , @xmath123 .",
    "the magnetization may be defined as @xmath124 with a corresponding order parameter given by @xmath125 which is zero in the high temperature paramagnetic phase and tends to one in the magnetised low temperature phase .",
    "the graph of @xmath126 , shown in in fig.(5 ) for a @xmath3-state potts model , is a skewed pitchfork but the phase transition takes place neither at @xmath127 where the low temperature branches meet , nor at @xmath128 where the high temperature , symmetric branch intersects the low temperature branch , but rather at a value @xmath129 which lies between the two where the high and low temperature actions @xmath50 ( i.e. free energies ) are equal @xcite .",
    "there is therefore a jump in the magnetization of @xmath130 at this point between the high temperature value and that on the magnetized branch . when @xmath117 ( the ising case ) the pitchfork is symmetric and the points @xmath131 coincide to give a continuous transition     for a @xmath3 state potts model as calculated from the saddle point solutions .",
    "only the portion of the graph close to the transition point is shown for clarity.,title=\"fig:\",height=245 ] [ phase ]    at first sight , this looks rather different to the picture presented by the wajnflasz - pick model , but we can recast the potts model transition on thin graphs as that of an ising model in a temperature dependent external field @xcite by noting that the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath132 , so setting @xmath133 and @xmath134 in @xmath135 to give @xmath136 \\phi^2   - { \\lambda \\over 3 } ( q -1 ) \\phi^3 + { 1 \\over 2 } \\tilde \\phi^2   - { \\lambda \\over 3 } \\tilde",
    "\\phi^3 - c ( q -1 ) \\phi \\tilde \\phi.\\nonumber\\\\ { } \\label{app1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is sufficient to capture the transition .",
    "the action of equ.([app1 ] ) containing only ( @xmath137 ) may then be rescaled using @xmath138 to give an action equivalent to that of an ising model in field @xmath139 where the new parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 are related to the original @xmath142 and @xmath0 via @xmath143 the external field parameter @xmath140 in equs.([app2],[params ] ) depends on the temperature @xmath60 via @xmath142 , so the temperature driven first order transition of the standard potts model on thin graphs appears in this formulation as the first order _ field _ driven transition of the ising model .",
    "substituting the value of @xmath142 at the first order transition point , @xmath129 , into the first of equ.([params ] ) gives @xmath144 , the zero field point , so the picture of the transition in this formulation is similar to that presented by fig.(4 ) where the first order transition occurs when the system crosses the first order line in the @xmath145 plane .",
    "if we take @xmath117 , then @xmath144 for all @xmath142 and the action becomes that of the standard ising model , which displays a second order transition .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to determine the phase diagram of the beg model with equal couplings on @xmath3-regular ( @xmath105 ) random graphs by considering the saddle point equations derived from an action which decorates the graphs with the appropriate statistical weights .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram thus derived shares the properties of other mean - field approaches and displays both first and second order transitions .",
    "using the equivalence of the beg model and a ( @xmath5,@xmath6)-state potts model with @xmath6 `` invisible '' states implies that the position of the triple point in the beg model can then be interpreted as showing that a ( @xmath5,@xmath6)-state potts model requires 17 or more invisible states in order to transmute the second order transition of the ising model on @xmath105 random graphs into a first order transition .",
    "although the number of invisible states @xmath6 needed to force a first order transition is larger than the other examples explored by tamura _",
    "et al _ , the position of the triple point which determines the critical value of @xmath6 for such a transmutation is not a universal quantity and would be expected to be lattice dependent .    as further evidence of such non - universality",
    ", we could take the @xmath146 in equ.([sbeg],[sbegeq ] ) to be @xmath28 hermitean matrices and consider the @xmath29 limit of the integral rather than the @xmath30 limit which has effectively been considered here for the thin graphs . in this case",
    "we would be evaluating the partition function of the beg model on an ensemble of _ planar _ random graphs , or if one preferred the partition function of the beg model coupled to 2d quantum gravity .",
    "this was done by fukazawa _",
    "@xcite for the equal coupling beg model on @xmath147 planar graphs ( i.e. planar , 4-regular random graphs ) , who found that the triple point coupling values on such graphs were given by numerical means as approximately @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in this model",
    "the relation between the crystal field @xmath23 and the couplings @xmath59 and @xmath67 is given by @xmath150 , so taking @xmath19 as before we have @xmath151 and a critical @xmath6 value of approximately @xmath152 .",
    "on such graphs a ( @xmath5 , @xmath6)-state potts model would display a third order transition ( the order of the ising transition on such graphs ) for up to 223 invisible states .",
    "the general effect of coupling spin models to planar random graphs is to `` soften '' the order of the phase transition ( the ising transition becomes third order , for example ) , so many more invisible spins appear to be necessary to overcome this compared with , for instance , a square @xmath2 lattice .",
    "we also noted that the first order transition of the standard @xmath0-state potts model on thin graphs could be thought of as a different sort of transmutation of the continuous ising transition on such graphs , analogous to the mapping between the wajnflasz - pick model and the ising model in an external field also discussed in @xcite .",
    "we remark in closing that the beg model has been studied on the bethe lattice using recursion relations in @xcite .",
    "it would be an interesting exercise to confirm that the saddle point equations used here were equivalent to the fixed point of these recursion relations , as is the case for other thin graph models which have been compared with their bethe lattice counterparts @xcite .",
