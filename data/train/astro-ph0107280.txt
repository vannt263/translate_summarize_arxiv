    "a wake structure is formed as the solar wind flows past the moon .",
    "the moon is to a good approximation an insulator , has no intrinsic magnetic field and a very thin atmosphere .",
    "measurements by lunar prospector @xcite and magnetohydrodynamic simulations @xcite of the magnetic fields on the moon indicate a typical scale height of 100 km for miniature magnetospheres around the magnetic anomalies ( these crustal remnant fields will be neglected here ) .",
    "this results in the moon being a sink for solar wind particles that collide with it . directly behind the moon , there will therefore be a void in which no solar wind particles are present . as the solar wind continues beyond the moon",
    ", this wake is filled in .",
    "explorer 35 and the apollo sub - satellites made the first measurements of the lunar wake , albeit with very low resolution .",
    "they were able however , to detect a significant depletion in density behind the moon .",
    "the wind spacecraft used the moon for a gravitational assist on december 27 , 1994 , passing at a distance of 6.5 lunar radii ( @xmath1 ) , through the lunar wake . with all its instruments switched on ,",
    "a slice of the structure of the lunar wake was obtained .",
    "these observations showed significant ion and electron depletions , rarefaction waves travelling away from the wake , increased electron temperatures , constant ion temperatures , counter - streaming ion beams , an increase in magnetic field strength and a number of electromagnetic and electrostatic waves @xcite .",
    "analytical descriptions of the processes involved in filling lunar wake have been considered @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected the counter - streaming beam distribution , creating a two - stream instability .",
    "@xcite then analytically considered a two - stream ion distribution with a background of electrons as the process by which the wake is replenished .",
    "simulations of this nature have previously been undertaken @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , whereas farrell _ et al . _ @xcite find that the ion dynamics dominate the interaction , the higher phase space resolutions of birch and chapman @xcite established that the electron dynamics dominate the evolution of the wake . in this paper we present new results from these simulations , including detailed particle density and electric field descriptions , a comprehensive analysis of the electron instabilities occurring in the wake , and a detailed description of the structure and dynamics of electron phase space holes generated in the wake that are not found in previous simulations .",
    "the simulation was performed using a self consistent , fully relativistic , collisionless 1@xmath0d particle - in - cell ( pic ) code . in these simulations , the ion and electron distribution functions",
    "are represented by a collection of `` superparticles '' .",
    "these `` superparticles '' , along with the electric and magnetic fields , can exhibit both full ion and electron kinetics .",
    "the velocities of the `` superparticles '' and the fields have vector components in three dimensions and all quantities depend on one spatial coordinate , y , and time . since @xmath2 , the component of @xmath3 along the simulation is constant , but given this restriction , the simulation is fully electromagnetic .",
    "the phase space resolution of the simulation scales as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of particles per cell . as in birch and chapman @xcite ,",
    "@xmath6 particles per cell were used , compared with @xmath7 particles per cell used by farrell _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dsimgeom ] shows the geometry of the simulation .",
    "the simulation box begins directly behind the moon , perpendicular to the solar wind flow ( @xmath8 direction ) and parallel to the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) ( y direction ) .",
    "a higher dimensional simulation would be required to describe the lunar wake when the imf is at oblique angles , and bulk flows other than in the solar wind flow direction , as the simulation is performed in the rest frame of the solar wind with zero convection electric field .",
    "the imf will pass almost unaltered through the moon since the moon can be assumed to be a perfect insulator and therefore no currents can flow to change the field . the simulation begins with a void in an otherwise maxwellian distribution of ions and electrons which mimics the removal of solar wind particles by the moon .",
    "full shadowing is appropriate since the electron and ion gyroradii ( 1.2 km and 47 km respectively ) are significantly smaller than one lunar radius ( @xmath91738 km ) . as the simulation box moves with the solar wind , the simulation run time",
    "can be equated to a distance behind the moon , effectively building up a 2d picture of the wake , provided the imf and solar wind flow remain constant .",
    "an ion to electron mass ratio of 20 has been chosen in order to evolve both ion and electron dynamics .",
    "this alters the simulation s ion plasma frequency and ion thermal velocity to be @xmath10 since @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "since the actual solar wind velocity is 25 times the ion thermal velocity @xmath13 , the simulation also requires this relationship .",
    "thus , the distance behind the moon is given by , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is measured in plasma periods , @xmath17 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath18 where @xmath16 is in plasma periods and @xmath1 is the radius of the moon , i.e. half the width of the void . in reality , @xmath19 ; this may affect the magnitude of the potential and effectively rescales @xmath14 .    the simulation run time is limited by the length of the simulation box .",
    "if a wake related structure passes over the boundary and interacts with other structures moving in the opposite direction , the simulation must be terminated since this introduces an unphysical distribution . in these simulations a 2048 grid cell simulation box has been used ( grid cell @xmath20 debye length , @xmath21 ) which equates to @xmath22 either side of a @xmath23 initial void .",
    "an initial void of @xmath24 has also been simulated to verify that structures found are not a result of the choice of the size of the initial void .",
    "we begin by discussing the structures and instabilities found and comparing them with theoretical predictions and other simulations .",
    "the results will then be compared to the wind observations at @xmath25 .",
    "the density profiles along the simulation box [ y(@xmath1 ) ] are plotted on a colour plot at regular intervals [ along x(@xmath1 ) ] , with colour representing density .",
    "figure  [ fig : big](a ) shows the evolution of the electron density over the entire simulation .",
    "the first structure to evolve is the rarefaction wave travelling away from the wake at the ion sound speed , @xmath26 .",
    "this is due to the electrons moving into the wake , and more electrons from the undisturbed plasma filling the space they leave .",
    "ogilvie _ el al . _",
    "@xcite used analytic solutions of plasma expansion into a vacuum and showed that in such a step in density of a plasma , from @xmath27 to a vacuum at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the expression for particle densities at later times along @xmath30 are given by the following @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the density of particle species @xmath33 , @xmath27 is the ambient solar wind density and @xmath26 is the ion sound speed : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electron temperature and @xmath36 is the ion mass .",
    "these equations describe a rarefaction wave travelling away from the density step ( @xmath28 ) in the @xmath37 direction ( away from the wake ) at the ion sound speed and an exponential decrease in density in the @xmath38 direction ( into the wake ) . in the electron density plot ( fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : big](b ) shows the evolution of the ion density over the entire simulation .",
    "again , there is a rarefaction wave in the ion density . this wave can be seen to be coincident with the electron rarefaction wave , and therefore also travelling at the ion sound speed in agreement with the above equations . by taking the electron density away from the ion density at all points in figs .",
    "[ fig : big](a ) and ( b ) , a charge density plot can be produced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : big](c ) ) .    further behind the moon , once a sufficient number of electrons have entered the wake , more structures begin to appear .",
    "after @xmath8(@xmath1 ) @xmath40 enhancements of the electron density and ion density in the central wake region can be seen .",
    "these are due to the electrons and ions streaming into the wake and setting up a counter - streaming beam distribution .",
    "such a distribution is unstable and subsequently a two - stream instability grows .",
    "this instability is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "the obvious density enhancements emerging from this region are due to the electrons being trapped by electric potentials generated by the instability .",

    "iii - e .",
    "the majority of the structures associated with the lunar wake are confined to within the rarefaction wave .",
    "some electron phase space holes , however , are accelerated above the ion sound speed and overtake the rarefaction wave .",
    "the other detectable structures again occur after @xmath8(@xmath1 ) @xmath40 , generally just outside the wake .",
    "these are slight fluctuations in the electron density , travelling away from the wake at velocities between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "they are caused by the most energetic electrons which have travelled right across the wake and out on the other side , setting up a bump - on - tail distribution .",
    "this distribution is unstable and again , an instability is grown , resulting in these electron density fluctuations .",
    "this is an example of the electron bump - on - tail instability and is discussed further in sec .",
    "iii - f .    comparing these density plots with those produced by the simulations with an initial void @xmath24 wide shows very little difference .",
    "the main difference is the distance between the double electron density peaks .",
    "they appear wider than in the @xmath23 simulations , however , they are actually similar sizes in debye lengths ( not shown here ) .    the simulations by farrell it et al .",
    "@xcite , display some similarities with these higher resolution simulations .",
    "rarefaction waves and a two - stream instability occur , which shall be discussed further in sec .",
    "no electron phase space holes are simulated nor is the bump - on - tail instability detected .",
    "figure  [ fig : big](d ) shows the magnitude of the electric field on the same x , y scale as fig .",
    "[ fig : big](c ) .",
    "the first electric field structure to appear is the ambipolar electric field .",
    "significant increases in the electric field magnitude can be seen at y(@xmath1 ) @xmath43 .",
    "the electric fields at these points are directed into the wake . since the electrons have a higher thermal velocity than the ions ( @xmath11 and @xmath44 ) they move into the wake first , setting up the electric fields pointing into the wake",

    "these initial charge separations can also be seen at the beginning of the charge density plot .",

    "electrons are trapped in these electric potential peaks , oscillating back and forth .",
    "some of these peaks evolve to become electron phase space holes and move out of the wake , coinciding with the double electron density peak about a single ion peak .",

    "<S> the solar wind plasma from the sun interacts with the moon , generating a wake structure behind it , since the moon is to a good approximation an insulator , has no intrinsic magnetic field and a very thin atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the lunar wake in simplified geometry has been simulated via a 1@xmath0d electromagnetic particle - in - cell code , with high resolution in order to resolve the full phase space dynamics of both electrons and ions . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation begins immediately downstream of the moon , before the solar wind has infilled the wake region , then evolves in the solar wind rest frame . an ambipolar electric field and a potential well </S>",
    "<S> are generated by the electrons , which subsequently create a counter - streaming beam distribution , causing a two - stream instability which confines the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this also creates a number of electron phase space holes . </S>",
    "<S> ion beams are accelerated into the wake by the ambipolar electric field , generating a two stream distribution with phase space mixing that is strongly influenced by the potentials created by the electron two - stream instability . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations compare favourably with wind observations . </S>"
