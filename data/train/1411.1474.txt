    "galactic globular clusters continue to pose a series of intriguing questions concerning stellar evolution , stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution .",
    "first , it has been known for several decades that globular clusters exhibit star - to - star variations in the cn and ch line strengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these molecular line strength variations are driven by star - to - star abundance variations for the light elements from c to al ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite for details . ) secondly , a star - to - star dispersion in iron - peak elements , and other elements , has long been known to exist in the globular cluster @xmath4 centauri ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , abundance dispersions have also been identified in a number of globular clusters including m2 @xcite , m22 @xcite , m54 @xcite , ngc 1851 @xcite , ngc 3201 @xcite , ngc 5824 @xcite and terzan 5 @xcite , although the shape of the metallicity distribution function differs between these objects .",
    "the light element abundance variations are believed to result from hydrogen burning at high temperature @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical site in which these nuclear reactions occur continues to be debated with asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , fast rotating massive stars , massive binaries and supermassive stars among the candidates @xcite .",
    "additionally , many details regarding the production of these abundance variations including the initial mass function , minimum timescale , required mass budget , degree of ( or need for ) dilution with pristine gas and star formation modes still need to be established @xcite . an important constraint on the site and nature of",
    "the nucleosynthesis comes from the c+n+o scale .",
    "for example , the @xcite solar values are @xmath5(c ) = 8.43 , @xmath5(n ) = 7.83 and @xmath5(o ) = 8.69 and this gives c+n+o = 8.92 . ]",
    "abundance sum . in fast rotating massive stars ,",
    "the c+n+o abundance sum is expected to remain constant ; the slow winds are enriched in h - burning products whereas the he - burning products are ejected at later times at high velocity @xcite .",
    "agb stars , on the other hand , are expected to increase the c+n+o abundance sum @xcite .",
    "that said , adjustments to the input physics can result in agb models that produce an essentially constant c+n+o abundance sum @xcite .",
    "the dispersion in heavy element abundances in @xmath4 cen has led to the suggestion that it is the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy @xcite . for",
    "the recently discovered globular clusters with dispersions in iron - peak elements , the chemical similarities with @xmath4 centauri may also require a similarly complex formation process .",
    "the sequence of events leading to the formation of these globular clusters remain poorly understood .",
    "some of these objects exhibit multiple subgiant branches , and it is well known that the c+n+o abundance sum plays a key role in age determinations based on subgiant branch analyses @xcite . in the case of ngc 1851 , the double subgiant branch @xcite could be composed of two coeval populations with different mixtures of c+n+o abundances @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of the double subgiant branch in ngc 1851 , understanding its nature and formation history has been an active area of research @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that ngc 1851 may be the product of the merger of two clusters @xcite .    despite the importance of the c+n+o content in globular clusters , there is only a modest number of studies on this topic ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for ngc 1851 , there are conflicting results regarding the c+n+o abundance sum @xcite . in the case of ngc 6752",
    ", @xcite found that the c+n+o abundance sum was constant , within a factor of @xmath22 , for their sample of dwarfs and subgiants .",
    "we note that the c , n and o abundances are typically derived from the ch molecular lines , cn molecular lines and [ oi ] atomic lines , respectively . due to molecular equilibrium , deriving the c abundance requires knowledge of the o abundance , and vice versa .",
    "similarly , n abundances derived from the cn lines require knowledge of both the c and o abundances .",
    "for n measurements from cn molecular lines , the uncertainties can be magnified by the errors associated with both the c and o abundances .",
    "the situation can be improved by analysis of the nh molecular lines .",
    "one advantage is that the inferred n abundance requires no knowledge of the c and/or o abundances .",
    "a clear disadvantage is that the best nh molecular lines are near 3360 ; this is a crowded spectral region and red giant branch stars have limited flux in the blue relative to redder wavelengths .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the c+n+o abundance sum in the globular clusters ngc 1851 and ngc 6752 .",
    "ngc 6752 is representative of the least complex globular clusters ; it has a single subgiant branch ( when not viewed using filters sensitive to molecular lines of ch , cn , co , nh and oh : @xcite ) and no large dispersion in iron - peak elements ( modulo the small but statistically significant variations identified by @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of c+n+o in this cluster would serve to constrain the origin of the light element abundance variations in globular clusters and provide an important baseline for comparison with multiple subgiant branch clusters .",
    "ngc 1851 is representative of multiple subgiant branch globular clusters with star - to - star abundance dispersions for iron - peak and neutron - capture elements .",
    "measurements of c+n+o in this cluster would help establish whether or not the double subgiant branch populations are coeval . the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the sample selection and observations .",
    "the analysis is presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 includes the results and discussion and we present concluding remarks in section 5 .",

    "oxygen abundances were determined by comparing synthetic and observed spectra near the 6300  [ oi ] line . in ngc 1851 ,",
    "relative abundances for na , mg and zr were measured based on an equivalent - width analysis .",
    "the @xcite solar abundances were adopted and the chemical abundances are presented in tables [ tab:6752 ] , [ tab:1851 ] and [ tab:1851namgzr ] . the metallicity , [ fe / h ] , was determined by averaging the results from fei  and feii  weighted by the number of lines from each species ( this approach strongly favours fei ) .    as noted in the introduction , the abundances for c , n and o are coupled due to molecular equilibrium . the processes described above required iteration until self - consistent abundances were obtained for a given program star . in the upper panel of figure [ fig:1851spec ] , the star with the lower c abundance ( nr 2953 ) has stronger ch lines relative to the star with the higher c abundance ( nr 6250 ) .",
    "this apparently unusual situation is a direct consequence of the relative o abundances ( nr 6250 has a considerably higher abundance ) and molecular equilibrium .",
    "uncertainties in the abundance ratios were obtained in the following manner .",
    "we repeated the analysis and varied the stellar parameters , one at a time , by their uncertainties .",
    "we also considered the uncertainty in the metallicity used to generate the model atmosphere , [ m / h ] , and varied this value by 0.1 dex .",
    "the systematic uncertainty was obtained by adding these four error terms , in quadrature ( although we note that this approach ignores covariances ) . to obtain the total error",
    ", we added the systematic and random errors in quadrature . due to molecular equilibrium",
    ", the uncertainty in the o abundance affects the derived c abundance , and vice versa .",
    "for these two species , we include an additional error term accounting for the uncertainty in these abundances . for the n abundances derived from the cn molecular lines ,",
    "we also need to take into account the uncertainties in the c and o abundances .",

    "inclusion of those four stars ( two in each of the canonical and anomalous rgbs ) does not change the two key results , namely , that the mean c+n+o abundance is higher for the anomalous rgb ( 8.35 @xmath0 0.11 dex ) compared to the canonical rgb ( 7.94 @xmath0 0.07 dex ) and that the dispersion in c+n+o for the canonical rgb ( @xmath1 = 0.28 @xmath0 0.09 dex ) likely exceeds that expected from the measurement uncertainties . the dispersion for the anomalous rgb",
    ", @xmath1 = 0.20 @xmath0 0.06 dex , can be attributed to the measurement uncertainties .",
    "had we not applied the 0.44 dex shift to the n abundances , the canonical rgb would still have lower c+n+o compared to the anomalous rgb .",
    "regardless of whether we include the @xcite sample or apply an abundance correction to n , in all cases the anomalous rgb has a higher content of c+n+o compared to the canonical rgb .",
    "such a result supports the scenario proposed by @xcite in which the two subgiant branch populations are roughly coeval , but with different c+n+o abundances .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite reported constant c+n+o abundances for a sample of 15 red giants in ngc 1851 .",
    "their sample consisted of eight and seven stars on the canonical and anomalous rgbs , respectively .",
    "they used the same diagnostics to measure the cno abundances as in this study and obtained c+n+o values of 7.99 @xmath0 0.02 ( @xmath1 = 0.07 ) and 8.02 @xmath0 0.04 ( @xmath1 = 0.11 ) for the canonical and anomalous rgbs , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "our values for the canonical and anomalous rgbs are 7.90 @xmath0 0.10 and 8.48 @xmath0 0.13 dex , respectively . for the canonical rgb ,",
    "our c+n+o values are in agreement . for the anomalous rgb ,",
    "our c+n+o values disagree by @xmath2 0.45 dex .",
    "there are three stars in common between this study and @xcite : nr 3213 = i d 9 ; nr 5543 = i d 16 ; nr 6217 = i d 20 . for quantities published by both studies , we examine the differences in the sense `` this study @xmath3 @xcite '' ( while [ fe / h ] can be compared for all three stars , we only measured o and c+n+o for the latter two objects ) and find the following : @xmath19[fe / h ] = @xmath30.05 @xmath0 0.02 ; @xmath19a(o ) = @xmath30.04 @xmath0 0.08 ; @xmath19c+n+o = + 0.42 @xmath0 0.10 dex .",
    "we are unable to compare stellar parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , radial velocities or individual c and n abundances since @xcite did not publish these values .",
    "nevertheless , there is good agreement for [ fe / h ] and a(o ) .",
    "the stars in common are n - rich , so the c+n+o differences between this work and their study are likely due to differences in n abundance .",
    "it is important to recognise , however , that we are analysing rgb objects rather than subgiant branch stars .",
    "therefore any conclusions we draw concerning the cno content of subgiant branch stars in ngc 1851 will necessarily assume that the abundances we derive for rgb objects would be similar to those on the subgiant branch .",
    "that said , we can compare our average abundances for the two rgbs to measurements of subgiant branch stars by @xcite .",
    "they measured c and n ( but not o ) in subgiant branch stars in ngc 1851 and found that the fainter subgiant branch had a higher c+n content than the brighter subgiant branch , 7.64 @xmath0 0.24 and 7.23 @xmath0 0.31 , respectively .",
    "given that the fainter subgiant branch connects to the anomalous rgb , our c+n values for the anomalous ( 8.45 @xmath0 0.14 ) and canonical ( 7.52 @xmath0 0.21 ) rgbs are qualitatively consistent with @xcite , although we note that they used different diagnostics to measure n abundances compared to this study .",
    "we now briefly discuss the two agb stars . with or without the arbitrary shift in n abundance",
    ", these two objects have c+n+o values that lie between the canonical and anomalous rgb populations . as no change in the c+n+o sum",
    "is expected to take place between the rgb and agb ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) , the agbs could come from either the upper envelope of the canonical rgb c+n+o distribution or from the lower envelope of the anomalous rgb c+n+o distribution .",
    "given the known differences in neutron - capture element abundances between the canonical and anomalous rgbs in ngc 1851 @xcite , measurements of neutron - capture element abundances in the agb stars could reveal whether they are chemically related to a particular rgb .",
    "our zr measurements in the canonical and anomalous rgbs follow the established pattern in this cluster , i.e. , the average zr abundance in the anomalous rgb population is 0.21 @xmath0 0.08 dex higher than in the canonical rgb sample ( see figure [ fig:1851namgzr ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , we could only obtain upper limits to the zr abundance for all agb stars , and those limits could be consistent with either the zr - rich anomalous rgb or the zr - normal canonical rgb .",
    "given the modest wavelength coverage for the ngc 1851 sample , we were unable to identify lines of neutron - capture elements that would yield reliable abundance measurements .",
    "figure [ fig:1851namgzr ] indicates that the canonical and anomalous rgbs have distinct o abundances .",
    "the two agb stars have o abundances in accord with the anomalous rgb , although any suggestion of association would be speculation given the small numbers of stars .     ]    as noted in the introduction , there is evidence for a small iron abundance dispersion in ngc 1851 @xcite . for our [ fe / h ] measurements ,",
    "the standard deviation is 0.055 @xmath0 0.011 dex .",
    "while @xcite obtained a similar value , 0.051 @xmath0 0.005 dex , our measurement errors are 0.08 dex ( see table [ tab : parvar ] ) such that the dispersion can be explained entirely by the measurement uncertainties . in figure",
    "[ fig:1851namgzr ] , there is no correlation between metallicity , [ fe / h ] , and c+n+o . in this figure",
    ", we also confirm the anticorrelation between o and na @xcite .",
    "additionally , we identify a positive correlation between na and c+n+o .    finally , @xcite examined cno abundances in the globular cluster m22 . like ngc 1851",
    ", m22 possesses a double subgiant branch as well as a spread in @xmath25-process element abundances .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath25-process rich stars ( which preferentially populate the fainter subgiant branch and anomalous rgb ) have a higher c+n+o content compared to the @xmath25-process normal stars , 7.84 @xmath0 0.03 ( @xmath1 = 0.07 ) and 7.57 @xmath0 0.03 ( @xmath1 = 0.09 ) , respectively .",
    "we stress , however , that m22 and ngc 1851 are rather different objects with distinct mean metallicities , metallicity dispersions , absolute luminosities and kinematics @xcite .",
    "we have studied the c+n+o abundance sum in the globular clusters ngc 6752 and ngc 1851 . for ngc 6752",
    ", there is no evidence for an intrinsic abundance dispersion given the measurement uncertainties ( @xmath23 0.10 dex ) , although the absolute value of the c+n+o sum depends on which set of molecular lines ( nh versus cn ) are used to obtain the n abundance .",
    "while such a result confirms previous investigations of this cluster , this study imposes considerably tighter constraints on the source of the light element abundance variations .",
    "the agbs , fast - rotating massive stars and/or massive binaries that may have operated in the early life of this cluster to produce the abundance variations for o , na etc .  must not alter the c+n+o sum . if ngc 6752 is representative of the least complex globular clusters , then by extension all globular clusters that exhibit no evidence for a metallicity variation or multiple subgiant branches may also have a constant c+n+o abundance sum despite large variations for individual light element abundances .    for ngc 1851",
    ", we confirm a large dispersion in the c+n+o abundance sum .",
    "that is to say , the observed c+n+o dispersion ( @xmath1 = 0.34 @xmath0 0.08 dex ) far exceeds that expected from measurement uncertainties alone ( @xmath2 0.20 dex ) .",
    "we find that the anomalous rgb has a higher c+n+o content than the canonical rgb by a factor of @xmath2 0.6 dex .",
    "such a result would support the scenario in which the two subgiant branch populations are roughly coeval , but with a different c+n+o abundance sum . within the limited sample of canonical rgb objects",
    ", there is evidence that the c+n+o abundance dispersion exceeds the measurement uncertainties and this may indicate an intrinsic spread within this population .",
    "confirming such an abundance dispersion within the canonical rgb population in this cluster would be of great interest for understanding the formation history of this complicated object .",
