    "an explicit knot parametrization for knots in @xmath0 has been useful in estimating some important numerical knot  @xcite invariants such as bridge number , superbridge number and geometric degree .",
    "it was shown that each knot in @xmath0 can be parametrized by an embedding from @xmath1 to @xmath2 of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are real polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the image of such an embedding is a long knot which upon one point compactification gives our knot in @xmath0 . in this connection",
    "the question of obtaining the polynomials of minimal degree  @xcite for a given knot type was explored .",
    "polynomial parametrizations have certain disadvantages .",
    "for instance , polynomial parametrizations of two knots @xmath6 and @xmath7 can not be combined to give a polynomial parametrization of the connected sum @xmath8 . on the other hand",
    "if we take the projective closure of a polynomial knot of degree @xmath9 in @xmath2 we obtain a knot in the real projective 3-space @xmath10 that intersects the plane at infinity at one point with multiplicity @xmath9 which upon small perturbation turns out to be projective closure of an embedding of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are rational functions .",
    "so , in general , we can study the projective closure of the embeddings @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are rational functions .",
    "these are knots in @xmath10 ( for general , non - algebraic , links in @xmath10 see  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we define :    a knot in @xmath10 is said to be a _ real rational knot _ of degree @xmath9 if its parametrization can be realized by a rational map @xmath18 , i.e. there exist homogenoeus polynomials @xmath19 , all of the same degree  @xmath9 , so that for any @xmath20\\in \\mathbb{rp}^1 $ ] , @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "@xmath22 is called the _ real rational representative _ of the knot .    using a weierstrass approximation like argument",
    ", it can be shown that all knots ( smooth ) in @xmath10 are isotopic to the projective closure of a real rational knot , but it gives no information about the degree .",
    "therefore , a natural problem is to classify all the possible real rational knots of a given degree .",
    "this was done for low degrees in  @xcite .",
    "to classify , one can find restrictions on the number or type of isotopy classes and find examples to account for those that are permitted by the known restrictions .",
    "in this paper we focus constructing examples ; more specifically , we focus on the `` gluing technique '' introduced by bjrklund in @xcite to construct real rational representatives of each of the ( projective ) knots with less than 5 crossings .",
    "however , unlike the examples in @xcite , we aim for methods involving gluing that produce real rational representatives for either all knots or interesting classes containing infinite knots , with a control on the required degree .",
    "the gluing construction  @xcite allows one to glue two knots , intersecting transversally at a single point , to form a knot with the sum of the degrees . in his paper that introduces gluing , bjorklund constructed examples of real rational knots of low degrees by gluing conics and lines .",
    "three natural questions arise :    1 .",
    "can one obtain a representative for any knot by gluing only lines and/or conics ? 2 .",
    "can one predict the number of lines / conics required and therefore the required degree , in terms of some number associated to the classical knot ?",
    "3 .   can one find a general method of gluing certain families of knots ( like the pretzel knots ) , and hopefully obtain a lower bound on the required degree .",
    "the upper bound can be in terms of a number associated to a classical knot , for instance the minimal edge number of a polygonal representation or the minimal number of certain words in a braid group representation .",
    "for specific classes of knots like the @xmath23  pretzel knot , one may get a bound in terms of the @xmath24 .",
    "there are two apparent difficulties when trying to glue conics or lines to obtain all possible knots .",
    "we will demonstrate that both these difficulties can be overcome owing to some basic properties that the gluing construction possesses .",
    "the first difficulty is that conics and lines are geometrically rigid , making local changes difficult in real rational knots , where as in classical knots , it is the topology and not the geometry , which matters .",
    "for instance , while gluing , one has to account for the possibility of additional crossings being imposed on us in a particular diagram .",
    "nevertheless , these crossings can be rendered harmless by crossing changes  ( see theorem  [ switchingcrossings ] ) , which is also obtainable by gluing .",
    "the price one pays for that is an increase in degree by 2 , for each crossing change .",
    "therefore , it becomes important to ensure that either additional crossings are avoided , or that they can be removed by reidemeister moves .",
    "the latter is equivalent to finding a suitable representative of the isotopy class , which is not necessarily the `` standard '' or simplest one .",
    "we will see that the braid group approach achieves the latter , i.e. it finds a suitable isotopic representation of a knot which can be constructed by gluing and does not require any crossing changes .",
    "the second difficulty is that the two knots must be glued at precisely one point .",
    "gluing at more than one point would inevitably require a `` self gluing '' .",
    "gluing takes two distinct knots that intersect transversally and smoothens the intersection algebraically .",
    "one may ask if we can algebraically smoothen the self - intersection of a single singular knot , thereby making the method more flexible . this is not possible because if a real rational knot intersects itself , any self - gluing ( smoothening of the self - intersection ) will result in a curve of genus bigger than 0 and therefore not rational .    despite these difficulties",
    ", we will see that the gluing construction is flexible enough and can be connected with certain perspectives in classical knot theory .",
    "we begin with some simple but important theorems , the first of which is that it is possible to switch a crossing by gluing an ellipse which will increase the degree of the knot by 2 .",
    "secondly , by choosing an appropriate orientation of a circle , one can glue the circle to form a twist .",
    "this has been used implicitly by bjrklund in his constructions of knots with crossings that are less than or equal to 4 and using this method , it is easy to construct all the pretzel knots and ( 2,k)-torus knots .",
    "we then turn our attention to a general construction of all possible knots .    we will demonstrate that the isomorphism between the quotient by the braid group by the pure braid group with the permutation group , along with the standard generators of the braid group perfectly fit together to allow the gluing of all knots .",
    "we will predict the existence of a real rational representative in a degree that can be expressed in terms of the minimal number of pure braid group generators .",
    "polygonal representations of knots are the most geometric and indeed we will demonstrate two ways of constructing real rational knots using polygonal representations and obtaining a bound in terms of the edge number , connecting the complexity of polygonal representations , which is measured in terms of the edge number , with the complexity of real rational representatives , which is measured in terms of the degree .",
    "each method has its advantages and disadvantages and it is unlikely that any one method will consistently produce a knot of a degree lower than the others .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]        given a polygonal tangle with @xmath26 edges and @xmath27 crossings , there exists a real algebraic parametrization @xmath22 of a knot and two points @xmath28 and @xmath29 in @xmath30 such that the image under @xmath22 of one of the two components of @xmath31 is a section of the tubular neighbourhood of the given polygonal tangle and the images of @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the end - points of the given tangle .",
    "assume that the lemma is true for for all tangles with @xmath34 edges .",
    "then , given a tangle which is a union of line segments @xmath35 , there exists a real algebraic knot @xmath36 and points @xmath37 and @xmath38 of that parameter , so that the image of the interval @xmath39 $ ] lies in the tubular neighbourhood of the tangle @xmath40 .",
    "reparametrize @xmath36 so that it @xmath37 is the image of @xmath41 and @xmath38 is the image of 0 .",

    "then by the theorem on gluing , we know that there is a knot @xmath22 in the tubular neighbourhood of @xmath46 . by the theorem , we also know that the points @xmath28 and @xmath45 are unchanged under the gluing since they were the images of @xmath41 and @xmath44 . by the gluing theorem ,",

    "first , we prove that there exists such a knot ( see figure  [ fig : polygonaltrefoil ] ) .",
    "choose a vertex of the polygonal knot and replace it by a very small edge @xmath49 contained in a small enough ball around the vertex so that the resulting knot now has one more edge .",
    "on removing the edge , one obtains a tangle and therefore by the previous lemma , there exists a real algebraic knot and points @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the parametrization so that the image under the parametrization of the interval @xmath50 $ ] is isotopic to the tangle . note that @xmath28 and @xmath29 lie in the ball .",
    "if we connect the end points of the image , under this parametrization , of @xmath51 $ ] , inside the sphere , then the resulting topological knot is isotopic to the given polygonal knot .",
    "let us call this topological knot @xmath52 .",
    "on the other hand , the image of complement of @xmath51 $ ] can also be joined at the end points to obtain a topological knot @xmath53 which may be linked to @xmath52 . by crossing changes , which can be achieved by gluing circles to the original real algebraic knot that was constructed , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be unlinked .",
    "denote the resulting knots by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "observe that @xmath54 is still isotopic to the given polygonal knot .",
    "furthermore , by crossing changes , one can ensure that @xmath55 is the unknot .",
    "therefore , our real algebraic knot is isotopic to the connected sum of the given polygonal knot and the unknot and is therefore isotopic to the given knot .",
    "now we compute the degree : for @xmath34 edges , @xmath34 lines are needed .",
    "that increases the degree to @xmath34 however some over crossings may need to be changed to under crossings and vice - versa in order to unlink and unknot the cylinder knot .",
    "observe that each vertex corresponds to an intersection of two lines , which accounts for @xmath34 out of the @xmath56 pairs .",
    "also , @xmath22 pairs of intersections in the projection account for the over and under crossings of the original knot .",
    "if we weaken the definition of an real algebraic knot , we can reduce the degree .",
    "let us consider @xmath57/0\\sim 1 $ ] .",
    "viewing @xmath58 in this way , a knot parametrization is equivalent to a map @xmath59 \\to \\mathbb{rp}^3 $ ] such that @xmath60",
    ". let @xmath61 \\to s^1 = [ 0 , 1 ] / 0 \\sim 1 $ ] denote the quotient map from the closed interval to the the circle .",
    "if we define parametrization @xmath62 to be real algebraic if @xmath63 can be represented as a the restriction of a rational map from the projective line to @xmath10 , then given a polygonal knot with @xmath34 edges , there exists a real algebraic knot of degree @xmath64 which is differentiable at one point and smooth at all other points .",
    "this follows from the previous proof by using part 3 of theorem  [ maingluingtheorem ] .",
