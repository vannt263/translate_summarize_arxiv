    "a particularly simple confinement scenario @xcite is available in the minimal coulomb gauge .",
    "it attributes confinement of color to the long range of the color - coulomb potential @xmath6 .",
    "this quantity is the instantaneous part of the 4 - 4 component of the gluon propagator , @xmath7 , namely @xmath8 .",
    "the vacuum polarization term @xmath9 is less singular than @xmath10 at @xmath11 . since @xmath12 couples universally to color charge , the long range of @xmath6 suffices to confine all color charge .",
    "it was conjectured that it is linearly rising at large @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "if an external quark - antiquark pair is present , the physical potential @xmath15 between them may be extracted from a wilson loop .",
    "the color - coulomb potential contributes the term @xmath16 directly to the wilson loop , where @xmath17 in su(n ) gauge theory with external quarks in the fundamental representation .",
    "the minus sign occurs because the antiquark has opposite charge to the quark .",
    "the vacuum - polarization term is screening , and one expects that @xmath15 is bounded above by this term asymptotically at large @xmath13 , @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath15 is also linearly rising , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the conventional string tension , we get @xmath21 . if dynamical quarks are present , the string `` breaks '' at some radius @xmath22 , and the conventional asymptotic string tension vanishes , @xmath23 .",
    "string - breaking is easily explained in the coulomb - gauge confinement scenario if @xmath6 is linearly rising even in the presence of dynamical quarks , as was also conjectured @xcite . for , if so , it is energetically preferable to polarize a pair of sea quarks from the vacuum .    here",
    "we report the confrontation of this scenario with the numerical data for @xmath6 for the case of pure gluodynamics .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +      we may identify @xmath6 with the phenomenological potential that is the starting point for qcd bound state calculations @xcite .",
    "the identification of a phenomenological potential with the instantaneous part of the gluon propagator , a fundamental quantity in the gauge theory , is possible because , remarkably , @xmath6 is a renormalization - group invariant , and thus scheme - independent , so it is independent of the cut - off @xmath26 and of the renormalization mass @xmath27 .",
    "this follows from the non - renormalization of @xmath28 , as expressed by the identity @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 refer to unrenormalized and renormalized quantities in the coulomb gauge @xcite .",
    "this identity has no direct analog in a lorentz - covariant gauge . because of the scheme - independence of @xmath6 , its fourier transform @xmath32 provides a scheme - independent definition for the running coupling constant of qcd , @xmath33 , and of @xmath34 .",
    "here @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is a finite qcd mass scale @xcite .",
    "we have previously studied @xcite both space- and time - components of the gluon propagator , @xmath37 and @xmath38 at equal time , at @xmath39 , on various lattice volumes , @xmath40 to @xmath41 , in the minimal coulomb gauge .",
    "this gauge is achieved numerically by ( i ) maximizing @xmath42 with respect to all local gauge transformations @xmath43 , where the sum is on all horizontal or spatial links , and then ( ii ) maximizing @xmath44 with respect to all @xmath45-independent but @xmath46-dependent gauge transformations @xmath47 where the sum is on all vertical or time - like links .",
    "this makes the 3-vector potential @xmath48 , for @xmath49 transverse , @xmath50 , so @xmath51 .    in this gauge ,",
    "the horizontal link variables @xmath52 , for @xmath49 are as close to the identity as possible , but the vertical variables @xmath53 are much further from the identity .",
    "not surprisingly , we found that , whereas @xmath37 gave values that could be reasonably extrapolated to the continuum , this was not true for @xmath54 . in order to remedy this , in the present study we extended our investigation of @xmath54 to @xmath55 , on lattice volumes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we have also determined @xmath6 numerically by 2 quite different methods .",
    "method i relies on the standard formula @xmath56 .",
    "method ii relies on the lattice analog of the continuum formula that is obtained @xcite by integrating out @xmath12 namely , @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is the 3-dimensional faddeev - popov operator , and @xmath59 is the gauge - covariant derivative .",
    "method ii requires numerically inverting the lattice faddeev - popov matrix to obtain @xmath60 , but it has the advantage that @xmath54 is expressed entirely in terms of the spatial link variables @xmath52 for @xmath49 , that are close to the identity . moreover , method ii involves only the horizontal link variables that lie within a single time slice , so it is independent of the gauge fixing ( ii ) on vertical links .",
    "thus it measures a truly instantaneous quantity .",
    "we found that method i did not exhibit scaling in the above range of @xmath4 , and we report here only the result of method ii .            for each @xmath4 we have 100 configurations on volume @xmath61 and 50 configurations on volume @xmath62 .",
    "runs have been done on the pc clusters at the physics department of new york university and at the ifsc of so paulo university .    in figure 1",
    "we plotted the results for @xmath63 2.2 , 2.5 , and 2.8 respectively .",
    "the horizontal axis measures @xmath64 , for @xmath65 , rescaled to physical units by setting the physical string tension equal to @xmath66 and using table 3 of @xcite , so the lattice spacing at @xmath67 is ( in @xmath68 ) @xmath69 1.066 , 0.839 , 0.605 , 0.433 , 0.309 , 0.231 , 0.165 , respectively .",
    "the vertical axis measures @xmath70 in physical units , so string tension may be read off from the vertical intercept ( see below ) .",
    "finite - volume artifacts are clearly visible at low momentum . to control these , in our fits",
    "we have dropped those low - momentum points for which appreciably different values are obtained at volumes @xmath2 and @xmath3 and , for the fit , we used only data points obtained at @xmath62 .",
    "a simple parametrization of @xmath6 would be @xmath71 , which has the fourier transform @xmath72 .",
    "we have used the fitting formulas @xmath73 fit ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) has the asymptotic behavior at large @xmath74 , consistent with the 1-loop @xmath4-function .",
    "we report in table  [ table:1 ] the values of the parameters from fit  ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) .",
    "the most striking feature of the data is the finite intercepts @xmath75 .",
    "this is consistent with a finite string tension @xmath76 .",
    "it scales rather nicely , varying from @xmath77 at @xmath39 to @xmath78 at @xmath79 , but with considerable variation in between . from the lowest and highest values , @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    ", we get respectively @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the inequality @xmath84 for su(2 ) , with @xmath85 , reads for these values : @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we appear to be at or near saturation ."
