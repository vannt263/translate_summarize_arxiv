    "there are now many detections of linear polarization signals associated with the absorptive component of the h@xmath0 line profile . with high spectral resolution ( r@xmath310000 )",

    "the absorptive polarization effects are ubiquitous in the herbig ae / be stars with roughly 2/3 of the windy and disky stars showing this linear polarization signature .",
    "the classical be stars more typically showed a broad ` depolarization ' morphology ( 10/30 ) but about half of these show additional absorptive effects ( 4/10 ) and another sub - set ( 5/30 ) show complex linear polarization spectral morphologies .",
    "the presence of absorptive polarization effects in most of the obscured stars in this survey suggests that the phenomenon may be present in any obscured star . in the optical pumping model described by kuhn et al .",
