    "the exquisite sensitivity of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ has provided vast improvements in our understanding of faint , hard x - ray sources .",
    "_ chandra _  observations of distant galaxies allow us to study the x - ray population at luminosities similar to those accessible in our own galaxy with wide - field x - ray instruments like the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ all - sky monitor and the _ bepposax _ wide - field camera ( @xmath11  erg s@xmath10 ) , while observations of our own galaxy are sensitive to sources a million times fainter than found with previous wide - field surveys .",
    "one of the most dramatic products of this improvement in sensitivity are the _ chandra _  observations of the galactic center ( wang , gotthelf , & lang 2002 ; baganoff  2003 ) . whereas previous imaging surveys identified dozens of x - ray sources against a background of bright galactic diffuse emission @xcite , _ chandra _   observations have revealed thousands of individual x - ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and discrete , filamentary features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this high concentration of x - ray sources is not surprising .",
    "the 2@xmath0@xmath108 ( 300@xmath1125 pc for a distance of 8 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) region centered on the galactic center contains roughly 1% of the galactic mass ( lauhardt , zylka , & mezger 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , unlike the galactic bulge , star formation has occurred continuously in the central region of the galaxy , as is strikingly illustrated by the @xmath360 ultra - compact hii regions in the giant molecular cloud sgr b2 @xcite , and by three young , dense clusters of massive stars ( the arches , the quintuplet , and the central parsec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a wealth of questions can be addressed with _",
    "chandra _  observations , and with subsequent comparisons to multi - wavelength catalogs .",
    "for instance , a variety of studies of the synthesis of compact , accreting binaries have been designed to explain the large number of x - ray sources _ chandra _   detects in the galactic center , and the results constrain , for example , the amount of angular momentum dissipated in the common envelope phase ( e.g. , pfahl , rappaport , & podsiadlowski 2002 ; belczynski & taam 2004 ; liu & li 2005 ; ruiter , belczynski , & harrison 2005 ) .",
    "_ chandra _  also can detect outbursts from transient low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) at much lower flux levels than are accessible with traditional wide - field x - ray surveys , which provides unique insight into the duty cycles and emission mechanisms of compact objects accreting at very low rates ( @xmath12 @xmath13  yr@xmath10 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . combining _",
    "chandra _  and radio observations can be used to identify young stars with powerful winds , which helps to constrain the rate at which massive stars have formed recently in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "several observational studies have discussed the population of x - ray sources in _ chandra _  surveys of the galactic center .",
    "@xcite presented images from shallow ( 12  ks ) _ chandra _   exposures of the 2@xmath0@xmath108 around , and gave a general overview of the number of x - ray sources and the properties of the diffuse x - ray emission .",

    "@xcite and @xcite and studied the x - ray emission from massive stars in several clusters , including the arches and quintuplet .",

    "however , aside from the inner 25 pc , no catalog containing all of the x - ray sources found within the inner 150 pc of the galactic center has been published .    in this paper , we rectify this by reporting the locations and basic properties of the x - ray sources detected in _",

    "the total numbers of wind - accreting neutron stars , and the fractions of systems with companions more and less massive than 8@xmath13 , varies by a factor of a few depending upon the the magnitudes of the kicks imparted to the neutron stars at birth .",

    "we then divided that count threshold by the exposure map from the most sensitive observation at the location of the source to obtain a flux threshold .",
    "again , this technique ignores local background variations that introduce systematic errors in our computed thresholds for individual sources , but these errors should average out when considering large numbers of sources .",
    "the median probability of detecting a galactic center source was 57% .",
    "this is because the photons from faint sources are often lost to the wings of the psf , and because the number - flux distribution is quite steep ( see  [ sec : ns ] ) , so many faint sources are only detectable when poisson fluctuations result in larger observed counts ( this produces the eddington bias when computing number - flux distribution ) .",
    "the sensitivity maps and detection probabilities were used in computing the spatial distribution in  [ sec : dist ] and flux distributions in  [ sec : ns ] .",
    "we also repeated the above process for the combined image created from 625  ks of exposure on the 17@xmath117  field around , so that we could compare the results from the catalog in @xcite to the current one .",
    "we find that a source can be detected confidently with the fewest counts in the shallow survey ( fig .",
    "[ fig : countthresh ] ) , because the longer observations were background limited .",
    "of course , the observations were still more sensitive when the detection threshold was considered as a function of flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thresharea ] ) .",
    "we modeled the un - binned number - flux distributions using the technique described in @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the cumulative number - flux distribution could be described as a power law @xmath141 , where @xmath98 is the net number of counts for a source , and that the number of observed counts could be described by a poisson distribution with mean rate @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the average number of background counts in the source extraction region ( e.g. , @xmath146=4.3 for the shallow survey ) .",
    "the likelihood of observing sources with a distribution of total counts @xmath147 ( which are all integers ) is then : @xmath148 where @xmath127 is normalization over the range of count rates under consideration ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) , @xmath151 the normalization of the power law @xmath100 drops out of equation  [ eq : lognlogs ] , and so it was derived by setting the normalization @xmath127 for the best - fit @xmath99 equal to the observed number of sources . finally , we compared the observed cumulative flux distribution to the model distribution @xmath152 using a ks - test , to establish whether our power - law model is consistent with the data .",
    "caution needs to be used in exercising these equations , as is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "first , the integrals over @xmath98 will diverge as @xmath98 approaches 0 unless a the count rate from a source is inconsistent with the background rate @xmath146 at the @xmath75@xmath92 level @xcite .",
    "therefore , we restricted our analysis to sources brighter than the 5@xmath92 detection threshold for the average background level in each region .",
    "the mean background and count thresholds are listed in table  [ tab : ns ] . in doing so , we were able to ignore the negligible contributions to the above integrals from beyond @xmath153 .",
    "second , our source - detection algorithm was designed primarily to reject false positives , and we find that false negatives occur for @xmath720% of sources with count rates at the 5@xmath92 level above background .",
    "we use the factor @xmath154 in the above equations to account for the probability of detecting a source with a count rate @xmath147 , which we determined from our monte carlo simulations .",
    "third , in order to avoid being biased by bright sources detected in regions with poor sensitivity , we only considered regions of the image in which there was a @xmath2790% chance of identifying a source with a flux equal to the 5@xmath92 detection threshold . we list in table  [ tab : ns ] the number of sources that met these criteria and the area over which we were sensitive .",
    "finally , we note that we used average values for the background and the detection probability , even though both varied significantly over the regions covered by each set of observations .",
    "the total counts @xmath147 used above were the sum of the net counts derived from our photometry and the average background , which was then rounded to the nearest integer .",
    "this was necessary to ensure that the integrand in equations b1 and b2 were monotonic functions of @xmath147 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our approach to modeling the @xmath95 distribution takes into account the possible eddington bias , although it ignores the vast majority of faint sources .",
    "different approaches are possible , and should yield similar results . for instance , @xcite used monte carlo simulations to estimate the corrections to the flux required to offset both the eddington bias and biases introduced by their method for deriving the photometry for each source , assumed that the photometric uncertainties were negligible , and analytically computed @xmath99 from a maximum - likelihood distribution using corrected fluxes and the equations in @xcite . we have not implemented this technique , because our procedure for computing the photometry for each source was computationally prohibitive to incorporate it into our monte carlo simulations . we also note that their resulting slope could be somewhat biased , because they have assumed a @xmath95 distribution in computing the flux correction , thereby pre - determining the effect of the eddington bias .    @xcite has presented a method that is almost equivalent to ours , in which he applied a redistribution matrix to convert a model distribution into an observed distribution , and then found best - fit parameters for the model using the chi - squared and cash minimization techniques implemented in @xcite . if the model and un - binned fluxes are compared using the cash statistic @xcite , the techniques are equivalent , although the use of a response matrix converts the integral in equation  [ eq : lognlogs ] into a sum . using binned data and",
    "a chi - squared test obviously requires enough sources per bin that their numbers are approximately distributed as a gaussian .",
    "that technique has the advantage of using tools that x - ray astronomers are familiar with , although it is conceptually more complicated than our method .",
