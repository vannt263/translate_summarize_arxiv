    "measurements of the properties of circumstellar accretion disks around young stars are important because they represent constraints on the initial conditions of planet formation .",
    "a unique set of measurements can be performed on a disk in the rare case in which it is seen close to edge - on . because an edge - on disk occults the central star , scattered light from the disk surface dominates the total emergent flux at optical and near - infrared ( ir ) wavelengths , making it possible to spatially resolve the disk with high - resolution imaging @xcite . at mid - ir wavelengths ,",
    "the outer disk is seen in absorption against the star and inner disk , allowing spectroscopic measurements of the disk composition @xcite .",
    "the sample of edge - on disks discovered to date remains small .",
    "some of the most notable examples are orion  114 - 426 @xcite , haro  6 - 5b @xcite , hh  30 @xcite , iras  04302 + 2247 @xcite , dg  tau  b @xcite , ophe - mm3 , crbr 2422.8 - 3423 @xcite , hk  tau  b @xcite , hv  tau  c @xcite , lkh@xmath5  263  c @xcite , 2mass  j1628137 - 243139 @xcite , and pds  144 @xcite .",
    "additional young stars in taurus exhibit dust lanes that may also trace edge - on disks @xcite .    because young stars with edge - on disks are seen only in scattered light at optical and near - ir wavelengths , they appear much fainter than unocculted young stars at a given spectral type .",
    "recent spectroscopic surveys of nearby star - forming regions have identified a number of objects that are subluminous in this manner @xcite .",
    "one of these sources , 2mass  j04381486 + 2611399 in taurus ( henceforth 2 m  0438 + 2611 ) , appears to be a brown dwarf with a mass near 0.05  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this brown dwarf also exhibits anomalous near - ir colors and strong forbidden line emission , which are characteristics that are frequently observed in stars with edge - on disks . to definitively establish whether 2 m  0438 + 2611 has an edge - on disk , we have observed it with near- and mid - ir spectroscopy and high - resolution optical imaging . in this paper , we present these new data (   [ sec : obs ] ) and fit them with the predictions of accretion disk models to constrain the inclination and other physical properties of the disk around 2 m  0438 + 2611 (   [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "to investigate the possibility that 2 m  0438 + 2611 is seen in scattered light , we first obtained a low - resolution near - ir spectrum of it with spex @xcite at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "these data were collected on the night of 2004 november 12 .",
    "they were reduced with the spextool package @xcite and corrected for telluric absorption @xcite .",
    "the final spectrum extends from 0.8 - 2.5  and exhibits a resolving power of @xmath7 .    for most of the young brown dwarfs that we have observed in previous studies ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , the differences in the slopes of their 0.8 - 2.5  spectra are consistent with differences in extinction",
    ". however , this is not the case for 2 m  0438 + 2611 , which has an anomalous slope that differs significantly from those of other objects , regardless of any correction for extinction using standard reddening laws @xcite .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in figure  [ fig : spec ] , where we compare 2 m  0438 + 2611 to a typical unreddened young brown dwarf with the same optical spectral type , which is the extinction implied by a comparison to other young brown dwarfs and to dwarf standards .",
    "based on that comparison , the spex data for 2 m  0444 + 2512 do not exhibit excess emission from a disk . ]",
    "the standard was artificially reddened according to the reddening law of @xcite to the point that it has the same relative fluxes at 0.8 and 2.5  @xmath8 as 2 m  0438 + 2611 .",
    "however , the shape of this reddened spectrum between 0.8 and 2.5  @xmath8 differs significantly from that of 2 m  0438 + 2611 .",
    "an alternative demonstration of this effect is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] through the quotient these two spectra , which departs from the constant value expected for normal reddening .",
    "thus , reddening can not explain the observed slope of 2 m  0438 + 2611 .",
    "instead , relative to the flux at 0.8  , the spectrum of 2 m  0438 + 2611 becomes redder more slowly with longer wavelengths than expected from standard extinction laws , which is consistent with the presence of ( blue ) scattered light in the spectrum .",
    "meanwhile , the absence of significant residuals in the quotient of 2 m  0438 + 2611 and the standard demonstrates the close match in the depths of the steam absorption bands , supporting the similarity in spectral types indicated by previous optical spectroscopy .",

    ", we obtained a mid - ir spectrum of 2 m  0438 + 2611 on 2005 march 19 with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a part of the guaranteed time observations of the irs instrument team .",
    "these observations ( aor 12705792 ) were performed with the short - wavelength , low - resolution module of irs , providing data from 5.3 - 14  with a resolving power of @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum was processed with the s14 pipeline at the _",
    "spitzer _ science center .",
    "the remaining reduction was performed with the methods that have been previously applied to irs data for other low - mass members of taurus @xcite .",

    "0438 + 2611 from archival images obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the methods described by @xcite , we measured a flux of @xmath10  mjy from these mips data .",
    "we present the spectra from spex and irs and the photometry from 2mass , irac , mips , and iram for 2 m  0438 + 2611 in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the irac and irs data agree well with each other , while the 2mass photometry and the spex data differ significantly in both color and flux level .",
    "the spex data are consistent with a smooth extension of the irac and irs data , while the 2mass measurements appear to be discontinuous from the latter .",
    "the irac and irs observations were performed only 4 months after the spex observations , while the 2mass data were obtained 6 years earlier .",
    "thus , one explanation for the discrepancy in the 2mass photometry relative to the other data is variability , which is plausible for any young star and is particularly likely for an object that is seen in scattered light because of changes in the geometry of the occulting material .",
    "therefore , we exclude the 2mass photometry for the purposes of modeling the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 2 m  0438 + 2611 in   [ sec : model ] .",
    "because of the initial evidence indicating that the sed of 2 m  0438 + 2611 might be dominated by scattered light at optical and near - ir wavelengths ( * ? ? ?",
    "*   [ sec : spex ] ) , we sought to detect spatially resolved scattered light through high - resolution broad - band optical imaging with the _ hubble space telescope_. in addition , given the presence of forbidden line emission in optical spectra of this brown dwarf @xcite , we performed narrowband imaging centered on [ o  i ] at 6300    in an attempt to detect resolved line emission from a jet or an outflow . using the wide field planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) aboard _ hubble",
    "_ , we obtained images of 2 m  0438 + 2611 through the f675w , f791w , f850lp , and f631n filters on 2005 october 22 .",
    "the target was placed near the center of the pc , which has a plate scale of @xmath11  pixel@xmath12 .",
    "two images were taken in each filter , each with exposure times of 160  sec for f675w , f791w , and f850lp and 300  sec for f631n .",
    "each pair of images at a given filter was combined to create a single image .    in the [ o  i ]",
    "image , 2 m  0438 + 2611 is unresolved and no extended emission is detected .",
    "meanwhile , each of the three broad - band images reveal both a point source and spatially resolved emission , as shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the extended emission is elongated and reaches 0.4-@xmath13 from one side of the point source at a position angle of @xmath14 .",
    "analysis of these images with the point - spread - function of wfpc2 indicates that a small amount ( @xmath15 ) of extended emission is present on the opposite side of the point source as well .",
    "we have modeled the sed of 2 m  0438 + 2611 in figure  [ fig : sed ] following the procedures from @xcite . in short ,",
    "we solve the equations for the disk vertical structure , assuming it is an @xmath5-disk heated by viscous dissipation and by stellar irradiation . the relatively high flux at 1.3  mm of this object @xcite suggests the presence of grains that are larger than typical grains in the interstellar medium .",
    "at the same time , the presence of the 10  silicate band and the shape of the extinction of the stellar sed are indicative of small grains .",
    "therefore , we have constructed a disk model in which a large fraction of the dust has settled in the midplane , growing to a maximum size of @xmath16  mm , while a small fraction of the dust remains in the upper layers in the form of small interstellar - like grains @xcite .",
    "the dust is assumed to be segregated spheres of `` astronomical '' silicates and graphite with abundances and optical constants from @xcite and @xcite and a size distribution of @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the grain radius @xcite .",
    "for the small grains in the upper layers , the minimum and maximum grain radii are @xmath19  and @xmath20  . for the large grains at the disk midplane",
    ", we use @xmath19  and @xmath21  mm .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio of the small grains is parameterized in terms of @xmath22 , which is the ratio normalized by the standard interstellar value of @xmath23 .",
    "we have calculated models for @xmath24 . the dust - to - gas mass ratio of the large grains at the midplane is calculated assuming that the total mass in grains is conserved at each radius .    in our model , the dusty disk is truncated at a radius @xmath25 , where the inner wall of the disk receives radiation from the brown dwarf and accretion shocks at the stellar surface with a normal incidence .",
    "a natural explanation for a wall of this kind is that the silicates are sublimated inside @xmath25 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the temperature at the inner edge of the disk is @xmath26  k. however , disks can be truncated at larger radii , corresponding to lower temperatures ( i.e. , transitional disks ) .",
    "therefore , we have modeled the wall emission following the procedures of @xcite , varying the temperature of the optically thin dust in the wall from 300 to 1400  k. we have adopted an accretion rate of @xmath27  @xmath28 for our disk model , which is similar to the value derived by @xcite for 2 m  0438 + 2611 through modeling of the profile of its h@xmath5 emission line .    although the disk surface density , @xmath29 , is not an input parameter for our models , we are able to modify it through the viscosity parameter @xmath5 since @xmath30 for an @xmath5-disk . when fitting the millimeter flux , decreasing @xmath5 ( i.e. , increasing @xmath29 ) has the effect of decreasing the outer radius of the disk . after exploring models for @xmath31",
    ", we find that the observed millimeter flux constrains @xmath5 to the low end of this range if the accretion rate in the outer disk is the same as the accretion rate onto the brown dwarf . @xcite .",
    "] for a brown dwarf disk , @xmath32 implies a viscous timescale of @xmath33  myr , which is too long to justify our assumption of a steady disk with a constant accretion rate throughout the disk .",
    "it is possible that the accretion rate increases with disk radius , as in the disk model from @xcite .",
    "a higher accretion rate in the outer disk would correspond to lower @xmath5 and shorter @xmath34 . in a disk of this kind",
    ", material would accumulate in the inner disk , perhaps in a dead zone .",
    "exploring this possibility in detail would require a disk model that includes a dead zone .    for the photosphere of 2 m  0438 + 2611",
    ", we have adopted an effective temperature of 2838  k @xcite . because this object is seen in scattered light at optical and near - ir wavelengths ( * ? ? ?",
    "*   [ sec : spex ] ) , its extinction can not be measured from its colors . as a result",
    ", we can not reliably measure its luminosity with the normal method of applying an extinction correction to photometry in these bands .",
    "therefore , we have performed the disk calculations for a range of luminosities that are typical of members of taurus near the spectral type of 2 m  0438 + 2611 , namely @xmath35 , 0.06 , 0.08 , and 0.1  @xmath36 . for 2 m  0438 + 2611",
    ", we adopt a mass of 0.05  @xmath6 , which is the value implied by its spectral type for a member of taurus @xcite . as shown in @xcite and   [",
    "sec : spex ] , 2 m  0444 + 2512 has the same optical and ir spectral types as 2 m  0438 + 2611 . in addition , although it exhibits mid - ir excess emission that indicates the presence of a disk @xcite , 2 m  0444 + 2512 does not show excess emission at wavelengths shortward of 2.5  in a comparison to spex data for diskless brown dwarfs near the same spectral type @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have adopted the extinction - corrected spex data for 2 m  0444 + 2512 described in   [ sec : spex ] to represent the 0.8 - 2.5  sed of the photosphere of 2 m  0438 + 2611 .",
    "we assume that both 2 m  0438 + 2611 and 2 m  0444 + 2512 are at the average distance of members of taurus ( @xmath37  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "we measured the average colors between 2mass @xmath38 and the irac bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0  ) for diskless late - type members of taurus @xcite and applied them to the spex data for 2 m  0444 + 2512 to extend the photospheric sed to 8.0  .",
    "the sed was extrapolated to wavelengths beyond 8.0  with a rayleigh - jeans distribution .      a given portion of the observed sed provides constraints on specific properties of the disk .",
    "we use the @xmath39-band flux to estimate the optical depth to the brown dwarf , which in turn constrains the inclination , outer radius , and viscosity parameter of the disk .",
    "the silicate feature near 10  is sensitive to both the inclination and the presence of small grains in the upper layers of the disk .",
    "the abundance of these small grains is constrained by the 24  flux relative to the emission at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the flux at 3 - 10  depends on the inner radius of the disk and the stellar luminosity , while the millimeter flux is determined by a combination of the outer radius and the surface density . in this section",
    ", we discuss each of these constraints in detail for 2 m  0438 + 2611 and present the resulting best - fit model for its disk .",
    "the best fit to the flux at 3 - 10  is provided by a stellar luminosity of 0.06  @xmath36 ( corresponding to @xmath40  @xmath41 ) and a radius of @xmath2  au for the wall , which corresponds to a wall temperature of 400  k. for models with the wall placed at the dust destruction radius , the predicted fluxes at 3 - 10  are brighter than the observed values . thus , our modeling indicates that the disk is inwardly truncated .",
    "the inner disk of 2 m  0438 + 2611 shows the same physical properties as disks that have been identified in the literature as `` transitional disks '' , and which have been shown to have truncated optically thick disks at various distances from the central stars , from both sed modeling @xcite and millimeter interferometry @xcite .",
    "disks of this kind are thought to harbor forming planets that are opening gaps in the disk @xcite .",
    "photoevaporation is an alternative explanation for these disk gaps , but it is unlikely for 2 m  0438 + 2611 given the low ultraviolet fluxes that are expected from a brown dwarf @xcite .    for all reasonable choices of model parameters , the reddened flux from the stellar photosphere should dominate the total emergent flux at @xmath42 - 3  . combining the luminosity of 0.06  @xmath36 and the observed @xmath39-band flux produces a value of @xmath43 for the optical depth to the photosphere .",
    "the 10  silicate profile of 2 m  0438 + 2611 is distinctive , showing both absorption and emission components .",
    "this profile tightly constrains the disk inclination because small angles produce only emission and large ones produce only absorption , as illustrated for the face - on and edge - on disks around fm  tau and dg  tau  b in figure  [ fig : sed2 ] @xcite . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the model predicts silicate emission from the disk and silicate absorption from the highly extinguished wall that combine to form absorption and emission features at 10 and 11  , which closely matches the data , as shown in figure [ fig : sed2 ] . while modeling ir and millimeter photometry for 2 m  0438 + 2611 , @xcite also used a high inclination angle of @xmath45 for their model of this disk .",
    "a high inclination was produced by their model because 2 m  0438 + 2611 is much fainter than the photosphere of typical young brown dwarfs , so a highly inclined , obscuring disk was needed to suppress the near- and mid - ir fluxes of their adopted photospheric template to the observed levels .",
    "thus , their evidence for a high inclination disk was equivalent to that presented by @xcite , who showed that 2 m  0438 + 2611 is anomalously faint at near - ir wavelengths for its spectral type and might be occulted by circumstellar material .",
    "the distinctive silicate features in our irs spectra ( as well as the extended emission in the wfpc2 images ) represent new evidence of a highly - inclined disk around 2 m  0438 + 2611 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the disk around 2 m  0444 + 2512 also might have a high inclination .",
    "however , the slope of its near - ir spectrum is consistent with a small amount of extinction and a normal reddening law , and thus does not indicate the presence of scattered light .",
    "in addition , an unpublished irs spectrum of 2 m  0444 + 2512 does not show the silicate absorption that is seen in 2 m  0438 + 2611 and other highly - inclined disks ( figure  [ fig : sed2 ] ) .",
    "the flux at 24  is sensitive to the degree of dust settling in the disk .",
    "we find that small grain abundances of @xmath46 in the upper layers of the disk are required to explain the observed 24  flux . for values of @xmath22 that are outside of this range , the predicted slope of the mid- and far - ir sed is smaller or larger than the observed one .    in table  [",
    "tab : models ] , we summarize the models that provide the best fits to the sed of 2 m  0438 + 2611 for five values of @xmath5 . the seds produced by these models are shown with the observed sed in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "these models reproduce the observed sed longward of 2  equally well , while the model for @xmath47 provides a somewhat better match to the flux at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the disk radii of these models range from 5 to 200  au .",
    "thus , the sed alone does not provide a useful constraint on the outer radius of the disk .    to estimate the disk radius for 2 m  0438 + 2611",
    ", we compare the images produced by each of our five models to the wfpc2 images in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the wfpc2 data show a central peak surrounded by asymmetric bipolar emission . in comparison ,",
    "the model images for @xmath48 and 12  au show a point source and no detectable extended emission and the model for @xmath49  au produces too much extended emission .",
    "meanwhile , the images from the models for @xmath3 and 40  au agree reasonably well with the wfpc2 images of 2 m  0438 + 2611 .",
    "the relative fluxes of the two lobes of emission are better matched by the model for @xmath3  au , while the length of the extended emission is better matched by @xmath50  au .",
    "thus , the wfpc2 images constrain the disk radius to be @xmath3 - 40  au and confirm the high inclination that is implied by the sed analysis . in addition , given that the model images are formed by stellar light scattered at the disk surface and extinguished by the outer disk , the agreement between the optical sed and the predicted scattered light spectrum and flux level ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) is further evidence supporting our estimate of the depletion factor of small grains in the upper disk layers .",
    "the young brown dwarf 2 m  0438 + 2611 exhibits several characteristics that are often observed in stars with edge - on disks , such as unusually faint near - ir fluxes for its spectral type , strong emission in forbidden transitions , and anomalous near - ir colors @xcite . through observations presented in this paper ,",
    "we have confirmed that 2 m  0438 + 2611 is occulted by a highly inclined disk .",
    "this new evidence is summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "based on a comparison to other young brown dwarfs , the slope of the 0.8 - 2.5  spectrum of 2 m  0438 + 2611 can not be explained as a photosphere reddened by a standard extinction law and instead is consistent with scattered light , which suggests that the brown dwarf is occulted by circumstellar material .",
    "2 .   the presence of silicate absorption at @xmath51  and silicate emission at @xmath52  constrains the disk inclination angle to be near @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath53 from edge - on ) because higher or lower inclinations would produce only absorption or emission , respectively .",
    "we detect asymmetric bipolar emission in wfpc2 images of 2 m  0438 + 2611 , which is consistent with simulated scattered - light images produced our model of a highly - inclined disk around this brown dwarf .",
    "in addition to its inclination , we have been able to constrain several other properties of the disk around 2 m  0438 + 2611 through modeling of its sed and high - resolution images .",
    "these constraints are made possible by the unusual wealth of data available for this disk , although achieving a self - consistent model that simultaneously reproduces those data has proved to be quite challenging . in our best - fit models ,",
    "the disk has an inclination of @xmath0 , an inner radius of @xmath54  au , an outer radius of 20 - 40  au , a total mass of 100 - 200  @xmath55 , and an abundance of small grains in its upper layers of @xmath56 , indicating a large degree of settling to the midplane .",
    "our estimate of the inner radius suggests the presence of a large inner hole , which is a characteristic of transitional disks @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the outer radius of the disk around 2 m  0438 + 2611 is somewhat larger than expected from models of embryo ejection ( @xmath4 - 20  au , * ? ? ?",
