    "most metal - poor stars have relatively high abundances of the so - called `` @xmath2-elements '' ( o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and ti )  which is to say that the number abundance ratios o / fe , ne / fe , etc .",
    ", are higher than one finds in the sun ( see , e.g. , the reviews by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . for instance , @xcite concluded from his review of the available observational data that globular clusters ( gcs ) with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 are overabundant in the @xmath2-elements by a factor of about two ( i.e. , [ @xmath2/fe ] @xmath12 in the standard logarithmic notation ) .",
    "since then , some gcs have been discovered to have solar proportions of these elements ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , recent field star studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have revealed a significant number of halo stars with [ @xmath2/fe ] @xmath13 , though the majority of such stars show the same level of enhancement as is typically found in gcs .",
    "given that the abundances of the individual @xmath2-elements appear to scale with the overall @xmath2-element abundance,/fe ] value generally represents the abundance ratios determined for the _ individual _",
    "@xmath2-elements to within 0.1 dex .",
    "oxygen may turn out to be an exception to this rule , but current estimates of the abundance of this element have large error bars associated with them because they depend sensitively on which spectral features are analyzed : much higher o / fe ratios are found from the ultraviolet oh bands ( @xcite , @xcite ) than from the @xmath14 nm [ o i ] lines ( @xcite ) . in this investigation",
    "we assume that all of the @xmath2-elements , including oxygen , vary together .",
    "the possibility that [ o / fe ] @xmath15 in extremely metal - deficient stars , and the consequences of such high oxygen abundances for synthetic c - m diagrams and for turnoff luminosity versus age relations , is considered by @xcite . ] the chemical composition of a globular cluster or population ii star is often described in terms of the two quantities [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath2/fe ] .",
    "it goes without saying that the models which are used to interpret stellar data should be computed for the run of chemical abundances that is actually observed  and given that there are star - to - star differences in the abundances of the @xmath2-elements at a fixed iron content , it is important to treat such variations explicitly .",
    "accordingly , a new grid of stellar evolutionary tracks has been computed by @xcite for 17 [ fe / h ] values between @xmath16 and @xmath1 assuming , in each case , [ @xmath2/fe ] @xmath17 , 0.3 , and 0.6 .",
    "these calculations have also taken into account the most important non - ideal effects in the equation of state as well as recent improvements to opacity data and nuclear reaction rates ( though gravitational settling and radiative acceleration processes are not treated ) . moreover , as fully discussed in paper i , the properties of local sudwarfs , the loci for gc red giants on the ( @xmath18)plane as inferred from infrared photometry , and the luminosities of rr lyrae variables as deduced from baade - wesselink , statistical parallax , and trignometric parallax studies are reproduced quite well by the models .",
    "reference should be made to that study for a full description of how variations in [ @xmath2/fe ] affect the tracks and zero - age horizontal - branches , both at a fixed [ fe / h ] and as a function of [ fe / h ] .    in paper ii , @xcite examined the implications of the new model grids for the ages of gcs and of field halo stars .",
    "the main results of that study are ( 1 ) the most metal - deficient clusters _ and _ field subgiants have ages @xmath19 gyr , ( 2 ) ages decrease with increasing [ fe / h ] ( by 23 gyr between [ fe / h ] @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) ( 3 ) the dispersion in age at a fixed metallicity appears to be small ( especially at [ fe / h ] @xmath22 ) , and ( 4 ) there is no more than a weak variation of age with galactocentric distance , if that .",
    "the photometric data for many of the clusters are still not as good as they need to be , relative age estimates based on the horizontal method , as described by @xcite , sometimes seem to be inconsistent with those derived from the @xmath23 technique ( suggesting that something besides , or in addition to , age is varying ) , and the uncertainties associated with most reddening , metallicity , and distance determinations remain large .",
    "consequently , the conclusions that were reached must still be considered tentative even though they seem well - supported by the observations _ as they presently exist_. ( many age - related issues , such as how best to intercompare synthetic and observed c - m diagrams for the determination of both absolute and relative ages , are discussed in paper ii . )    the primary purpose of the present investigation is to make the @xmath2-element enhanced isochrones and what we have called `` isochrone population functions '' ( ipfs ) readily available to the astronomical community .",
    "an ipf is derived from the slope of the predicted mass_distance _ relation in @xmath24/mag , where the distance along an isochrone , on any color  magnitude plane for which good color@xmath25 relations are available , is defined with respect to some arbitrary , well - defined point . in conjunction with an assumed mass spectrum ,",
    "ipfs thus provide the means to generate synthetic stellar populations in a very straightforward way or to calculate luminosity functions ( lfs ) or color functions ( cfs ) .",
    "the value and importance of lfs have long been appreciated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but it is only recently that @xcite have pointed out that the distibution in color of stars along the subgiant branch has the potential to provide an age constraint that is not only completely distance - independent , but is also nearly metallicity - independent . to obtain meaningful results from observed cfs , superb photometry and very large subgiant samples are needed , but it should be possible to meet these requirements in the case of the nearest and most massive of the galaxy s gcs .",
    "certainly , all aspects of observed c - m diagrams should be fully investigated in order to achieve the best possible understanding of stellar systems .    in the following section , an improved algorithm for interpolating in evolutionary sequences for isochrones and ipfs",
    "is described : this is based in large part on the scheme introduced by @xcite .",
    "section 3 outlines how to execute the software that has been developed to obtain isochrones , ipfs , lfs , and cfs , and provides a fairly detailed description of the output of these codes . in ",
    "4 , some additional discussion beyond that contained in papers i and ii is presented on how well the present computations appear to satisfy observational constraints .",
    "brief concluding remarks are given in  5 .",
    "the mathematical formalism for the derivation of accurate ipfs parallels that for the derivation of luminosity functions presented in bv92 , except that the distance along an isochrone is used as the observable coordinate instead of luminosity . in the @xmath26@xmath27 plane ,",
    "the distance along an isochrone is defined by @xmath28^{1/2 } , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are chosen to stretch the sgb region and to obtain a convenient range of distances .",
    "( we have chosen @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and we arbitrarily define @xmath33 at the lowest mass point on the isochrone . )",
    "the slope of the mass  distance relation is then obtained from@xmath34^{1/2}.\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] consequently , equation ( 6 ) from bv92 is recast as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of stars with mass @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the differential isochrone population function .",
    "( note that the second of these two equations becomes the familiar definition of a differential luminosity function if @xmath39 is replaced by @xmath40  see bv92 . )",
    "the evaluation of the partial derivatives in equation ( 2 ) is performed as described in bv92 .    in the observer s plane ,",
    "the distance is calculated with respect to a well - defined , but arbitrary , point on the isochrone . for this paper ,",
    "a point on the subgiant branch ( sgb ) 0.05  mag redward of the main - sequence turnoff ( regardless of color index ) , has been adopted as the distance zero - point with the idea that it should be relatively easy to identify in observed cmds .",
    "a convenient definition of distance is @xmath41^{1/2 } , \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the absolute magnitude in the @xmath43 passband and @xmath44 is the color index for passbands @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "however , the transformation of equation ( 3 ) from the theoretical plane to the observer s plane involves the derivatives of both the color transformations and the bolometric corrections .",
    "rather than attempt to evaluate these numerically , it is easier to construct a @xmath47@xmath48 calibration which can be used to translate bin limits from the observer s plane to the theoretical plane , and then to perform integrations across bins on the theoretical plane .",
    "isochrones , ipfs , lfs , and cfs are interpolated from grids of evolutionary tracks for stars of the same initial chemical composition but different masses . consequently",
    ", the most fundamental interpolation is the one in which the mass is derived from the age ",
    "mass relation for a given evolutionary phase .",
    "the obvious advantage of an interpolation scheme in which mass is a monotonic function of age is that the mass is uniquely determined once the age and evolutionary phase are specified .",
    "the corresponding luminosities , effective temperatures , and their temporal derivatives then can be interpolated with respect to mass .",
    "the basic approach to setting up the interpolation scheme remains as it was described in bv92 , with up to seven primary  equivalent evolutionary phase \" ( eep ) points ( see , in particular , their fig .",
    "2 ) located on each track between the zero - age main sequence and the tip of the rgb .",
    "the definitions of two of these points have been revised slightly .",
    "the first primary eep is now taken to be the point at which the central hydrogen content falls to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the adopted h abundance in the initial fully convective model on the hayashi line .",
    "this corresponds quite well with the zero - age main - sequence location of the model on the h - r diagram .",
    "the more noteworthy change resulted from the discovery that the age ",
    "mass relation defined by the second primary eeps can be non - monotonic just where the blue hook begins to manifest itself ( at @xmath51 ) , if the amount of convective overshoot is assumed to increase with increasing mass .",
    "( depending on whether the star has a radiative or convective core during the main - sequence phase , the second primary eep corresponds to either the turnoff point or the minimum @xmath25 that is reached just prior to the blue hook , respectively . )",
    "it is however , relatively easy to avoid this difficulty .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f1 ] , the competition between the @xmath52-@xmath52 chain and the cno cycle produces a small dip in the derivative @xmath53 for the lower mass tracks that develops into the blue hook at higher mass . when this feature appears _ after _ the turnoff point , it is used to define the second primary eep .",
    "track in fig .  1 ) .",
    "perturbations to the model arising from the procedures used to optimize the mesh point distribution or to calculate the atmospheric boundary conditions are the most likely causes of this behavior . however , the amplitude of such variations is clearly very small and of little consequence for computed ipfs . ] over the range 0.51.8  @xmath54 in stellar mass and for metallicities @xmath55}\\le + 0.12 $ ] that we have investigated , the age ",
    "mass relations for the primary eeps remain monotonic",
    ". will be the subject of a forthcoming paper by d.a .",
    "vandenberg , p.a .",
    "bergbusch , and p.d .",
    "dowler ( in preparation ) . ]",
    "thus , it is possible to maintain the monotonic behaviour in the secondary eep relations that are obtained by dividing each evolutionary phase interval , bracketed by a pair of primary eeps , into an equal number of regularly placed sub - intervals . for the evolutionary tracks of low - mass stars which achieve ages of 30 gyr before reaching the turnoff point ,",
    "the placement of the last secondary eep is determined by matching it with the secondary eep having the same central hydrogen content on the track of the next higher mass .      in bv92 , linear interpolation was found to be acceptable for all of the eep relations , except for the evaluation of derivatives along the direction of interpolation . in the absence of a better solution at the time",
    ", these derivatives were evaluated from a cubic polynomial fitted through the eep points  in other words , the derivatives were obtained from smoothed versions of the eep relations .",
    "however , for this paper , the interpolations and evaluations of derivatives were performed with the akima spline ( akima , 1970 ) , for complete internal consistency . among the various spline routines tested ,",
    "the akima spline was found to be the best for tracing the subtle morphology of the eep relations , as it is particularly good at avoiding the typical spline overshooting that occurs when the behaviour of the spline points is non - polynomic .",
    "in addition , as one may infer from fig .  6 of bv92 , linear interpolation tends to produce the onset of the convective hook in the isochrones at ages slightly greater than those predicted by the evolutionary sequences .",
    "akima spline interpolation reduces this discrepancy over the entire range of metallicities that we have investigated .",
    "the differences between isochrones derived via akima spline interpolation and those derived using linear interpolation can be readily appreciated by comparing the eep relations that give the turnoff effective temperatures and luminosities as a function of mass .",
    "the @xmath3  eep relations , plotted in upper panel of figure  [ f2 ] , reveal small , but detectable , differences between linear interpolation and akima spline interpolation at the turnoff , even for low mass stars .",
    "moreover , the largest differences always occur when there is an abrupt change in the behaviour of the eep relation .",
    "for example , in the [ fe / h]@xmath56 , [ @xmath2/fe]@xmath17 grid , isochrones with ages 8 and 12 gyr , interpolated by either method , are virtually identical at the turnoff because they have turnoff masses near 0.9 and 0.8 solar masses , respectively . however , the turnoff masses for ages 10 , 14 , and 16 gyr , lie near @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively ; i.e. , approximately midway between the computed tracks .",
    "the @xmath3 eep relations shows a distinct change in slope at @xmath60 , around which the spline deviates noticeably from the linear relations . as can be seen from the lower panel of fig .  2 , the difference in @xmath27 for a mass of @xmath58 is @xmath61 .",
    "this means that the temperature predicted by the akima spline interpolation , for the turnoff of a 14  gyr isochrone , is @xmath62 cooler than that derived by linear interpolation .",
    "similar observations can be made about the luminosity eep relations , plotted in the upper panel of figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "the differences in @xmath63 between the two interpolation methods , plotted in the lower panel , reveal that turnoff luminosities are consistent to within 0.02  mag in @xmath64 over the entire range of masses plotted , and to within 0.008  mag over the range of turnoff masses relevant to globular cluster studies .",
    "it should be emphasized that the points plotted in the eep relations of figs .  2 and 3 are taken _ directly _ from the model tracks . in most instances ,",
    "they were identified automatically by software designed to recognize the primary eeps .",
    "thus , they directly reflect the behaviour of the models at the masses specified .",
    "one problem that is exposed by the spline approach occurs as a result of the fact that there are usually more tracks with zero - age main sequence eeps than turnoff eeps , and more with turnoff eeps than with eeps on the subgiant branch ( because lower mass tracks are not extended past an age of 30 gyr ) .",
    "consequently , the nature of the spline fit to the eeps changes abruptly when the number of points used to construct the fit changes .",
    "this sometimes manifests itself as a small discontinuity on an isochrone generated via the akima spline , that would not be evident on one generated by linear interpolation .",
    "( we emphasize that such discontinuities are virtually undetectable ; we have ensured this by extending low mass tracks to the base of the rgb in the grids where discontinuities appeared on isochrones near the turnoff . )    while the akima spline provides an accurate means of interpolating the points along an isochrone , its chief advantage over linear interpolation is that derivatives can be evaluated directly at each point . a comparison between differential ipfs on the theorist s plane , derived from akima spline interpolation via the approach defined by equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , and ipfs calculated directly from the tabulated masses and distances obtained via linear interpolation , is shown in figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "the discontinuities evident on the main sequence portion of the linearly interpolated ipfs occur wherever an isochrone crosses one of the evolutionary tracks .",
    "they are caused by the abrupt changes in the slopes of the interpolation relations at these points .",
    "such discontinuities would also be evident in linearly interpolated lfs and cfs ; they did not appear in the lfs presented in bv92 because the slopes of the eep relations were derived from cubic polynomial fits to the eep points .",
    "first we describe the general morphology of the ipfs with respect to the expected evolutionary behavior , using the examples plotted in figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "the transition from the main sequence to the rgb occurs near @xmath65 for both the metal - rich and the metal - poor cases , because the distance , as we have defined it , is calculated with reference to a point on the subgiant branch 0.05  mag redward of the turnoff .",
    "the relatively broad local maximum immediately following the transition , at @xmath66 , corresponds to the inflection point in the temperature evolution at the base of the rgb .",
    "the evolutionary pause on the rgb is located at a distance near @xmath67 to @xmath68 in both cases .",
    "the extension of the upper rgb to distances beyond @xmath69 in the @xmath70=+0.12 $ ] grid occurs because giant branch evolution in color is stronger than in more metal - poor stars , and color evolution is weighted more strongly than luminosity evolution in the calculation of distance along an isochrone .    in the theorist s plane ,",
    "the derivatives of luminosity and temperature with respect to time along evolutionary sequences tend to have some numerical noise on the lower rgb , more obviously in the metal - rich grids .",
    "the very fine wiggles seen on the lower rgb portion of the interpolated metal - rich ipf plotted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "5 are a manifestation of this .",
    "all of the other structures not predicted by canonical theory arise from the adopted color@xmath3 relations and the bolometric corrections .",
    "this is particularly evident at the faint end of the models in the upper panel of fig .  5 , where the plateau - like structure near @xmath71 in the ipf has no counterpart at the faint end of the theorist s ipfs plotted in fig .  4 .",
    "similar irregularities can be seen on the upper rgb , such as the one that is weakly evident near @xmath72 in the upper panel .",
    "it turns out that this anomaly is also found near @xmath73 in the corresponding cf ( not shown ) , and that it occurs over the same range in ( ) as the plateau - like structure on the main sequence .",
    "moreover , artifacts of the bolometric corrections , evident near the bright and faint ends of the corresponding lf ( not shown ) , are also found to occur over the same range in ( ) .",
    "one conclusion that can be drawn from fig .",
    "5 is that neither the color@xmath3 relations nor the bolometric corrections are solely responsible for a number of the features on the computed ipfs .",
    "most of them are probably not real ; indeed , it is our impression that the transformations to the observed plane are not as consistently determined for the metal - rich grid as for the metal - poor grid .",
    "for instance , only very minor artifacts appear on the ipfs for the latter case .",
    "the small glitch near @xmath74 on the ipf can be traced to a corresponding glitch near @xmath75 on the cfs , etc .",
    "comparisons with observations are needed for definitive conclusions : at this point , we can only say that , for the metal - rich grids in particular , the discontinuous behavior on both the main - sequence and on the rgb portions of the cfs between @xmath76 , and the corresponding wiggles at the bright and faint ends of the lfs originate in the same @xmath77 region of the transformation tables in which the color indices and bolometric corrections are interpolated . @xmath78 is prepared for publication . ]",
    "for this paper , the grids of evolutionary tracks described in paper i have already been processed with software that automatically locates the primary eeps . in this section ,",
    "we describe how to use the software and we give examples of the file formats currently available .    each grid of models",
    "is contained in an eep file ( denoted by the file extension .eep ) with the format illustrated in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the first seven lines have the same format in all of the subsequent files produced from the eep file .",
    "the first line specifies that this particular file contains seven tracks ; lines 2 through 6 list the adopted chemical abundances and line 7 gives the assumed mixing length parameter .",
    "for each track , there is a header line listing the mass , the number of models in the track ( npts ) , the last model generated via the lagrangian code ( match ) , the shifts in age and in @xmath79 applied to the subsequent giant branch models computed via the @xcite method , the age of the first model on the track , and the model numbers of the primary eeps . in the example illustrated , the primary eeps for the @xmath80 track are located at models 1 , 36 , 134 , 198 , 278 , and 434  this track does not have a convective hook and thus the three spaces following the turnoff point ( 36 ) are blank . within each track , the entries are the model number , the luminosity , the effective temperature , the age , the central hydrogen content , the derivative of luminosity with respect to time , and the derivative of the effective temperature with respect to time .",

    "however , since stars in the post - turnoff stages of evolution have the same colors as those along the main sequence , the distributions have been separated at the color of the turnoff .",

    ", the effective temperatures of most stars , including the best - studied population ii subdwarfs , appear to be uncertain at the level of about 100 k , which clearly limits the ability of such data to provide stringent constraints on predicted @xmath95 scales .",

    "paper i concluded that the present models provide a good fit to the local subdwarfs on the [ @xmath96diagram , _ if _ metallicities close to those adopted by gratton et al .  (",
    "1997 ) are assumed for them . but whether or not comparable agreement is found on the [ @xmath93]plane , if the _ temperatures _ derived by gratton et al",

    "in fact , it turns out that there is quite good consistency between these two plots . to illustrate this ,",
    "we have constructed `` mono - metallicity '' subdwarf sequences consisting of those subdwarfs that have the smallest uncertainties in their parallaxes , along with a few subgiants to permit an evaluation of the ages of stars that have evolved past the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "that is , we have used our isochrones ( only in a differential sense ) to correct the inferred @xmath25 and intrinsic color of each field halo star , at its observed @xmath98 , to the temperature and color it would have if it had [ fe / h ] = @xmath0 .",
    "( we chose the lowest metallicity in our grid as the reference [ fe / h ] value because the few subgiants that we have considered are very metal - deficient and it is desirable that the @xmath25/color adjustments which are applied to them be as small as possible to avoid introducing significant errors into the determination of their ages . )    the result of this exercise on the [ @xmath99plane is shown in figure  [ f6 ] .",

    "however , we would not expect their displacements to hotter temperatures to be more than @xmath1140.010 , judging from our models , and such small shifts are probably consistent with the uncertainties associated with the @xmath25 and [ fe / h ] determinations .",
    "( we have no explanation for the somewhat anomalous location of hd@xmath6145417 relative to the locus defined by the other subdwarfs . )    as illustrated in figure  [ f7 ] , the same subdwarfs define a mono - metallicity sequence on the @xmath115$]plane that is also in good agreement with the same isochrones , when the predicted effective temperatures are converted to @xmath116 colors using very close to @xcite transformations ( see paper i for some discussion of the adopted color@xmath25 relations ) .",
    "thus , there is no obvious need to adjust either the temperatures or the colors of the models in order to satisfy the constraints posed by the subdwarf sample that has been considered .",
    "granted , a couple of the stars ( hd@xmath625329 , hd@xmath6188510 ) are slightly displaced from the theoretical loci in fig .  7 , but not in fig .  6 , which suggests that the adopted temperatures and colors are not perfectly consistent with one another . but this could simply be an indication that the reddenings of these two stars are slightly higher than the values adopted by carretta et al .",
    "an underestimation of the reddenings of hd@xmath6134439 and hd@xmath6134440 could also explain why they sit on the same locus as hd@xmath6103095 despite the latter having [ @xmath2/fe ] @xmath117 ( gratton et al .",

    "as emphasized by @xcite , hd@xmath6140283 provides an especially strong argument that there are very old stars and , furthermore , that the most metal - deficient globular clusters must be of comparable age if the local subgiants are representative of cluster subgiants of similar metal abundance .",
    "indeed , paper ii has shown that excellent agreement between synthetic and observed c - m diagrams is obtained for such systems as m@xmath692 if its age is @xmath118 gyr . to be sure",

    "the left - hand panel reproduces the same isochrones that were plotted in fig .  7 and it is obvious that a superb match to the cluster fiducial is obtained if the adopted distance is near @xmath120 and if @xmath121 mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "this case assumes a value of @xmath92 that is needed to satisfy the solar constraint ( see paper i ) , and the distance is approximately what one would infer from hd@xmath6140283 if m@xmath692 and the field subgiant are close to being coeval .",
    "however , even if the cluster distance modulus is actually as high as @xmath122 , it is still possible to obtain an equally fine fit to the _ shape _ of the observed c - m diagram simply by adopting @xmath123 ( see the right - hand panel ) .",

    "hence , in this instance , one may have to postulate some variation in the value of the mixing - length parameter with evolutionary state in order to match the entire c - m diagram .",

    "the main problem with this scenario is that a very large correction must be applied to the model colors in order for the relevant isochrone ( for an age of @xmath125 gyr ) to match the observed turnoff color .",
    "such a large color shift would seem to be precluded by the comparisons given in figs .  6 and 7 .",

    "it seems highly improbable that m@xmath63 is 56 gyr younger than m@xmath692 and that the isochrone fit would would be so problematic for the one cluster , but not for the other .",

    "these corrections were always to the red and they tended to be systematically larger at higher [ fe / h ] values , which may indicate the lack of sufficient blanketing in the model atmospheres constructed by bell & gustafsson for cool , relatively metal - rich giants . in any case , it is desirable to force the _ colors _ of the upper giant branches to agree with those observed in order to enhance the usefulness of our models in stellar population studies .",

    "in contrast to the colors , which were constrained to some extent to satisfy empirical data ( for giants only ) , the bolometric corrections to @xmath83 magnitudes do represent purely theoretical predictions ( at all temperatures , gravities , and [ fe / h ] values ) .",

    "as argued therein and in the present investigation , the short distance scale is also implied by field population ii subdwarfs and subgiants .",
    "thus , in order to satisfy other constraints , we conclude that our models fail to match the observed luminosities of the rgb bump in clusters by @xmath205 mag .",
    "this is certainly speculation on our part , but not without justification .",
    "the location of radiative  convective boundaries in stars is subject to a lot of uncertain physics and it would not be too surprising that current models are somewhat lacking in this regard . whether or not the scenario that we have described is realistic may be difficult to confirm or refute until the uncertainties associated with current distance , @xmath25 , and chemical abundance determinations are significantly reduced .",
    "the algorithms presented in bv92 to produce isochrones , lfs , and cfs from grids of evolutionary sequences have been improved with the implementation of the akima spline to replace linear interpolation .",
    "experiments with the interpolating algorithms show that they work well , over a wide range in metallicity ( @xmath206[fe / h]@xmath207 ) and ages ( from @xmath15 gyr , which is the youngest age that has been examined , to 20 gyr ) , to produce the morphology of isochrones accurately .",
    "moreover , what we have called the  isochrone population function \" , which literally gives the number of stars at any location along the corresponding isochrone , has been built into the interpolation algorithms .",
    "software ( fortran 77 ) has been developed to implement the algorithms for grids of evolutionary sequences with @xmath208\\le -0.30 $ ] .",
    "each grid of sequences is available with three @xmath2-element enhancements : [ @xmath2/fe]@xmath17 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 .",
    "[ note that the diffusion of helium and heavy elements has not been treated in the models .",
    "however , as mentioned at the end of section 4.2 ( also see grundahl et al .",
    "2000 ) , current observations of population ii stars appear to be inconsistent with the predictions of diffusive models ( like those recently reported by salaris , groenewegen , & weiss 2000 ) , for reasons that have yet to be understood . ]",
    "the evolutionary grids , together with the software are available to the astronomical community , so that users can generate isochrones , ipfs , lfs , and cfs for the particular set of abundances and ages of interest to them .",
    "the ipf is a particularly powerful tool for stellar astrophysics and for stellar population studies because it contains all of the information found in isochrones , lfs , and cfs in a compact form .",
    "for example , magnitudes and color indices for synthetic stellar populations can easily be generated from the cumulative form of the ipf for any pair of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , for which empirically constrained color@xmath3 relations and bolometric corrections are supplied as part of the package .",
    "( transformations to the strmgren system , presently being developed by j.  clem at the university of victoria , will be provided in the near future .",
    "those involving the @xmath211 , and possibly @xmath212 , bands will be added at a later date . ) a side benefit of the differential ipfs , lfs , and cfs is that they provide a way of fine tuning the transformation tables that are used to transpose the models from the @xmath81@xmath77 plane to the observer s plane .",
    "the additional tests of the models that we have carried out to augment those described in papers i and ii suggest that the computed temperatures and adopted color@xmath3  relations are quite realistic .",
    "the apparent agreement between the predicted and observed properties of local subdwarfs having well - determined parallaxes ( @xmath213 , as measured by _ hipparcos _ ) is especially encouraging .",
    "indeed , there should be no difference between the distances which are derived to e.g. , globular star clusters when the observed fiducials are fitted either to the subdwarf calibrators or to our theoretical isochrones .",
    "however , in practice , the large uncertainty that presently exists in the gc [ fe / h ] scale ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is a severe limitation of the main - sequence fitting technique . be that as it may , it is our impression that something close to the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale is required to achieve the best overall consistency between synthetic and observed cmds ( and between distance estimates based on the subdwarf and rr lyrae  standard candles \"  see paper ii ) .",
    "both in zero - point and in slope , and on either the theoretical or observed planes , our computed giant branches agree well with those derived observationally .",
    "the models do not reproduce the luminosity of the rgb bump as well as they should , but this may simply be an indication that there is some overshooting of the convective envelopes of red giants into their radiative interiors  as suggested some time ago by , e.g. , the padova group ( alongi et al .",
    "1991 ) . in conclusion , we believe that the present grid of models is particularly well constrained and it should provide a valuable tool for the interpretation of stellar data , whether through the fitting of isochrones , lfs , and cfs or through the construction of integrated stellar population models whose properties can be compared with those of distant systems .",
    "we thank raffaele gratton for providing his estimates of the effective temperatures for a few field halo stars .",
    "the support of operating grants ( to p.a.b .  and to d.a.v . ) from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada is also gratefully acknowledged .",
