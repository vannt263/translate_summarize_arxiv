    "as it is well - known , due to the condensate of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cooper pairs at sufficiently low temperature , a nucleon many - body system , such as a large n nucleus or bulk nuclear matter in neutron stars , will be in superfluid state with many various interesting phenomena , like the properties of medium - mass @xmath2 nuclei produced at the radioactive nuclear beam facilities  @xcite , the deuteron formation in medium - energy heavy ion collisions  @xcite , and the equation of state of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "considering the spin and isospin degrees of freedom , the nn cooper pairs should have rich inner structure and hence different phase diagrams .",
    "recently , two research directions in the study of nuclear matter receive more attention .",
    "one is the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite .",
    "when nuclear density decreases , the weakly correlated nn bcs state at high density may go over to the bec superfluid of nn bound state at lower density .",
    "although the bcs and bec limits are physically quite different , the change from bcs to bec was found to be smooth  @xcite . for neutron - proton ( @xmath3 ) pairs in @xmath4 channel , the chemical potential changes sign at a critical density which can be regarded as a criterion of the formation of bec and finally approaches to a half of the deuteron binding energy at low density limit  @xcite .",
    "recently , the possible bcs - bec crossover of neutron - neutron ( @xmath5 ) pairs in @xmath6 channel was studied by examining the spatial structure of two correlated neutrons  @xcite and the density and spin correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "it was found that a di - neutron bec state can be formed in symmetric nuclear matter at very low neutron density .",
    "however , when the degree of isospin asymmetry is high , there is no such a bec state in the whole density region .",
    "the other direction is the possible phase transition induced by the mismatch between neutron and proton fermi surfaces  @xcite . when the isospin asymmetry becomes sufficiently high ,",
    "namely when the mismatch is comparable with the @xmath3 pairing gap , the pairing will be suppressed . a phase transition from the bcs state to normal nuclear fluid",
    "is expected at a critical isospin asymmetry . however , for an asymmetric system , besides the bcs state , some other superfluid states are suggested in condensed matter and nuclear matter , such as the sarma phase  @xcite or breached pairing phase  @xcite where the superfluid component is breached by the normal component in momentum space , the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase  @xcite where a cooper pair has a total momentum and the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken , the deformed fermi surface phase  @xcite where the fermi surfaces of the two species are deformed into ellipsoidal shape and cross to each other so that cooper pairs with zero total momentum could form at the cross node , and the phase separation ( ps ) in real space  @xcite where the normal and superfluid components are inhomogeneously mixed .",
    "since nucleons could form cooper pairs in both isospin singlet and triplet channels , it is natural to ask a question of how the competition between the isospin @xmath0 pairing , namely the @xmath3 pairing , and @xmath1 pairing , namely the @xmath5 and @xmath7 pairing , affects the bcs - bec crossover and thermodynamics of nuclear superfluid . to have an insight into this question , we perform in this paper a mean field analysis for the asymmetric nuclear matter with the above two kinds of pairings .",
    "the mean field approximation is an effective and successful treatment at low temperature or for weakly correlated systems . at high temperature or for strongly coupled systems ,",
    "pair fluctuations may become significant  @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our study on the bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature and the thermodynamics at high density . to simplify numerical calculations",

    "we summarize in section [ 5 ] .",

    "the system is in normal state when the asymmetry or temperature is high enough , and the superfluid is in homogeneous state at high temperature and fflo state at low temperature .",
    "however , the number susceptibility in the region of low temperature and low number asymmetry is not positive - definite , the fflo state in this region is therefore unstable against the number fluctuations , and the ground state is probably an inhomogeneous mixture of the bcs superfluid and normal nuclear fluid .",
