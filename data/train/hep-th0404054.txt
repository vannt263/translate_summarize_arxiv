    "we do not claim that spacetime has exactly this noncommutativity , rather we are interested in investigating a mathematically sound gauge theory based on this easiest noncommutative structure .",
    "general aspects of this noncommutative theory will then probably be in common with more refined choices of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular the choice @xmath9 constant breakes the lorentz group in a spontaneous way ; in a bigger theory we would like to consider @xmath10 ( or the related @xmath11 field ) dynamical and not frozen to a constant value , thus recovering lorentz covariance .",
    "one can also consider gauge theories with @xmath1 nondynamical but frozen to a particular nonconstant value , linear in the coordinates , such that one has a ( kappa ) deformed poincar symmetry , see @xcite .",
    "using seiberg - witten map @xcite , that relates commutative gauge fields to noncommutative ones in such a way that commutative gauge transformations are mapped in nc gauge transformations , one can construct nc gauge theories with arbirary gauge groups @xcite .",
    "these theories are invariant under both commutative and noncommutative gauge transformations . along these lines",
    "noncommutative generalizations of the standard model and gut theories have been studied @xcite .",
    "the sw map and the @xmath12 product allow us to expand these noncommutative actions order by order in @xmath1 and to express them in terms of ordinary commutative fields so that one can then study the physics properties of these @xmath1-expanded commutative actions , see for ex .",
    "it turns out that given a commutative ym theory , sw map and commutative / noncommutative gauge invariance are in general not enough in order to single out a unique noncommutative generalization of the original ym theory .",
    "one can follow different criteria in order to select a specific noncommutative generalization .",
    "we here focus on a classical analysis , in particular imposing the constraint that the noncommutative generalization of the standard model should be compatible with noncommutative gut theories .",
    "another issue would be to single out a noncommutative sm or gut that is well behaved at the quantum level .",
    "we refer to the problems relative to renormalization , see for ex . @xcite . on the other hand chiral gauge anomalies",
    "are absent in these models @xcite . in this",
    "talk , following @xcite , we present a general study of the ambiguities that appear when constructing ncym theories .",
    "we then see that at first order in @xmath1 there is no ambiguity in @xmath0 ncym theory .",
    "in particular no triple gauge bosons coupling of the kind @xmath13 is present .",
    "we further study the noncommutative sm compatible with @xmath0 .",
    "we next study the reality , hermiticity , charge conjugation , parity and time reversal properties of the sw map and of @xmath1-expanded ncym theories .",
    "this constraints the possible freedom in the choice of a `` good '' sw map . in @xcite the @xmath3 properties of ncqed",
    "were studied assuming the usual @xmath14 and @xmath15 transformations also for noncommutative fields .",
    "we here show that the usual @xmath3 transformation on commutative spinors and nonabelian gauge potentials imply , via sw map , the same @xmath3 transformations for the noncommutative spinors and gauge potentials .",
    "we also see that @xmath16 is always a symmetry of noncommutative actions . in @xcite @xmath16",
    "is studied more axiomatically .",
    "the reality property of the sw map is then used to analyze the difference between the sm in @xcite and the gut inspired sm proposed here .",
    "it is a basic one , and can be studied also in a qed model . while in @xcite , and in general in the literature , left and right handed components of a noncommutative spinor field are built with the same sw map , we here use and advocate a different choice : if noncommutative left handed fermions are built with the @xmath17 sw map then their right handed companions should be built with the @xmath18 sw map ; this implies that both noncommutative @xmath19 and @xmath20 are built with the @xmath17 sw map .",
    "in other words , with this choice , noncommutativity does not distinguish between a left handed fermion and a left handed antifermion , but does distinguish between fermions with different chirality .",
    "this appears to be the only choice compatible with gut theories .",

    "however , due to the sw map , the degrees of freedom of @xmath28 are the same as that of @xmath35 . similarly to @xmath28 , also @xmath26 is valued in the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath21",

    "the fermion representation and the adjoint representation .",
    "the adjoint representation is particularly appealing if we just have a pure gauge action , then , since only the structure constants appear in the commutative gauge kinetic term @xmath51 , a possible choice is indeed to consider only the adjoint representation .",
    "this is a minimal choice in the sense that in this case only structure constants enter ( [ ambiguity ] ) .",
    "( it can be shown @xcite that in this case the gauge action is even in @xmath1 ) .",
    "if we also have matter fields then from ( [ covder ] ) we see that we must consider the particle representation @xmath52 given by the multiplet @xmath25 ( and inherited by @xmath29 ) . in ( [ ambiguity ] ) one could then make the minimal choice of selecting just the @xmath52 representation .    along the lines of the above ncym theories framework we now examine the @xmath0 , the @xmath2 and the standard model noncommutative gauge theories .",
    "* noncommutative * we consider only one fermion generation : the @xmath53-dimensional spinor representation of @xmath0 usually denoted @xmath54 ( no relevant new effects appear considering all three families ) .",

    "the gauge and fermion sector of noncommutative @xmath0 is then simply obtained by replacing @xmath29 with @xmath59 in ( [ action1multiplet ] ) .",
    "notice that no linear term in @xmath1 , i.e. no cubic term in @xmath60 can appear .",
    "this is so because @xmath0 is anomaly free : @xmath50 forall @xmath41 . in other words , at first order in @xmath1 , noncommutative @xmath0 gauge theory is unique .",
    "* noncommutative * the fermionic sector of @xmath2 has the @xmath61 multiplet that transforms in the @xmath62 of @xmath2 and the @xmath63 multiplet that transforms according to the @xmath64 of @xmath2 . in this case",
    "we expect that the adjoint , the @xmath65 and the @xmath64 representations enter in ( [ ambiguity ] ) . in principle",
    "one can consider the coefficients @xmath66 , i.e. while the @xmath67 fermion rep .",
    "is @xmath68 , in ( [ ambiguity ] ) the weights @xmath42 of the @xmath65 and the @xmath64 can possibly be not the same .",
    "it turns out that only if @xmath66 then @xmath69 in ( [ traccia ] ) .",
    "we see that , already at first order in the noncommutativity parameter @xmath1 , noncommutative @xmath2 gauge theory is not uniquely determined by the gauge coupling constant @xmath70 , but also by the value of @xmath71 . thus @xmath2 is _ not _ a truly unified theory in a noncommutative setting .",
    "it is tempting to set @xmath72 so that exactly the fermion representation @xmath73 enters ( [ traccia ] ) .",
    "we then have @xmath74 , ( however this relation is not protected by symmetries ) .",
    "* ( gut inspired ) noncommutative standard model @xmath75 * one proceeds similarly for the sm gauge group . the full ambiguity of the gauge kinetic term is given in @xcite .",

    "the covariant derivative is as in ( [ covder ] ) , with @xmath78 and with @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are the generators of @xmath81 .",
    "the fermion kinetic term is then as in ( [ action1multiplet ] ) .",
    "this standard model is built using only left handed fermions and antifermions .",
    "we call it gut inspired because its noncommutative structure can be embedded in @xmath0 gut .",
    "indeed @xmath82 and @xmath83 differ just by the extra neutrino @xmath57 ; moreover under an infinitesimal gauge transformation @xmath30 , all fermions in @xmath82 transform with @xmath30 on the left .",
    "this gut inspired standard model differs from the one considered in @xcite ; indeed here we started from the chiral vector @xmath82 , while there the vector @xmath84 is considered . in the commutative case @xmath85 but in the noncommutative case",
    "( see later ) this is no more true : @xmath86 ; if we change @xmath1 into @xmath18 in the right handed sector of @xmath87 , then the two expressions coincide .",
    "finally it is a natural choice to consider in the sm gauge kinetic term only the adjoint rep . and the fermion rep .",
    ", we then have that at first order in @xmath4 there are no modifications to the sm gauge kinetic term .",
    "this is so because the fermion rep .",

    "higgs sectors@xmath75 * while the noncommutative higgs kinetic and potential terms are given by ( d_)^d^ + ^2 ^ - ^ ^  , a noncommutative version of the sm and gut yukawa terms is not straighforward and requires the introduction of the hybrid seiberg - witten maps @xmath90 on fermions .",

    "the yukawa term ( [ hsw ] ) is thus invariant under noncommutative gauge transformations .",
    "of course in the @xmath94 limit we recover the usual gauge transformation for the leptons .",

    "there the hybrid sw map is considered on @xmath95 , in particular there @xmath96 is not invariant under @xmath56 gauge transformations ( and this implies that in @xcite gluons couple directly to the higgs field ) .    the higgs sector in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 models can be constructed with similar techniques @xcite .",
    "from ( [ swa ] ) we see that if @xmath35 is hermitian then @xmath97 is also hermitian",

    "one proceeds similarly for the case of hermitian conjugation . *",
