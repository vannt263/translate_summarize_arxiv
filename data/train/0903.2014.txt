    "naively it would seem that this acceleration should increase in the future , since the density parameter for matter will approach zero and dark energy will dominate the dynamics of evolution of the universe . however , at the same time as @xmath188 , the equation - of - state parameter for dark energy , @xmath183 , approaches @xmath165 ( see fig .  [ fig - wy2 ] ) . as a result",

    "in this section , we calculate the full gravitational - wave spectrum of the salam - sezgin cosmological model using the formalism of the continuous bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "this formalism was first applied to particle production in an expanding universe by parker  @xcite and later extended to the case of gravitons by henriques  @xcite and moorhouse , henriques , and mendes  @xcite . it avoids , in a natural way ,",

    "the above differential equations are integrated numerically , from the beginning of the inflationary period till the present time .",
    "we assume that prior to the inflationary period the universe was radiation - dominated and , therefore , no gravitons were created , i.e. , @xmath203 and @xmath204 for @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is a bogoliubov coefficient related to @xmath198 and @xmath199 through @xmath207 .",
    "the appropriate initial conditions for the functions @xmath198 and @xmath199 are then @xmath208 and @xmath209 . the gravitational - wave angular frequency at present time , @xmath210 , is taken to vary from about @xmath211 ( corresponding to a wavelength equal , today , to the hubble distance ) to about @xmath212 ( corresponding to a wavelength equal to the hubble distance at the end of the inflationary period ) .    the full gravitational - wave spectrum for the salam - sezgin cosmological model is shown in fig .  [ fig - espectro ] .",

    "[ sect - numerical - simulations ] .        for angular frequencies corresponding to the present size of the hubble horizon , an upper limit on the gravitational - wave spectral energy density parameter can be derived from measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation , namely , @xmath213 for @xmath214 @xcite . the gravitational - wave spectrum of the salam - sezgin cosmological model satisfies this constraint easily .    in the intermediate range of frequencies , from about @xmath215 to about @xmath216 ,",
    "the gravitational - wave spectrum differs substantially from the ones obtained , with the same formalism , in refs .",
    "@xcite , in that it has a non - constant slope .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in previous investigations , numerical evaluation of the bogoliubov coefficients started at the end of inflation and , moreover , it was assumed , for the purpose of determining the initial conditions for the functions @xmath198 and @xmath199 , that the inflationary period was either exponential or of the power - law type .",
    "this assumption was needed since exact analytical solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ xx1 ] ) and ( [ yy1 ] ) are known only for these types of inflation . as a result ,",
    "the gravitational - wave spectrum had , in the intermediate range of frequencies , zero slope  @xcite or constant negative slope  @xcite , respectively .",
    "in this article , we have improved our calculation by numerically evaluating the bogoliubov coefficients from the very beginning of the inflationary period .",
    "this approach allow us to consider any type of inflation , not just exponential or power - law .",
    "this is rather convenient for the cosmological model under consideration , since , during inflation , the equation - of - state parameter @xmath217 changes smoothly from @xmath218 to @xmath165 ( see fig .  [ fig - equacao - estado-1 ] ) , i.e. , inflation is neither exponential nor power - law .",
    "the shape of the spectrum in the intermediate range of frequencies can be understood as follows .",
    "it is known that , for power - law inflationary models , the spectrum has constant negative slope in this range of frequencies  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the derivation of this result using the formalism of continuous bogoliubov coefficients ) . in the limit where power - law inflation approaches exponential inflation ( @xmath219 , where @xmath220 ) , the slope of the spectrum approaches zero .",
    "now , let us regard the evolution of our cosmological model , during inflation , as a succession of short periods of time , with duration @xmath221 , such that in each of them inflation can be considered to be of the power - law type with @xmath222 .",
    "gravitational waves that cross the hubble horizon during the first of these periods , have today low frequencies . since during this period the equation - of - state parameter is @xmath223 ( see fig .  [ fig - equacao - estado-1 ] )",
    ", corresponding to @xmath224 , the spectrum , for such low frequencies , is almost flat . during the second period of time",
    ", @xmath225 is slightly higher and the spectrum has a small negative slope in the corresponding frequency range .",
    "continuing with this process , we obtain a spectrum that is a succession of line segments with increasing ( in modulus ) slope as the frequency of the gravitational waves increases .",
    "taking the limit @xmath226 , we obtain , in the intermediate region of the spectrum , the shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - espectro ] .",
    ", during the first stage of evolution.,width=325 ]    the gravitational - wave spectrum of the salam - sezgin cosmological model shows no structure in the mhz / ghz frequency range .",
    "such a structure is expected in cosmological models in which standard ( cold ) inflation is followed by a preheating and/or reheating stage  @xcite . in such models , after the inflationary period the inflaton field oscillates about the minimum of the its potential , leading to particle production and an increase of the energy density of radiation .",
    "the structure of the gravitational - wave spectrum in the mhz / ghz range of frequencies depends on the form of the inflationary potential near its minimum . more specifically ,",
    "if the potential near its minimum is proportional to @xmath227 , then @xmath228 increases with the increase of @xmath229  @xcite .",
    "contrarily to these standard ( cold ) inflationary cosmological models , we have assumed that , within the salam - sezgin cosmological model , inflation is of the warm type .",
    "that is , the energy density of the @xmath61 and @xmath62-fields is continuously transferred to the radiation fluid and , consequently , the energy density of radiation is not diluted during inflation . because the energy density of radiation decreases slower than the energy density of the @xmath61 and @xmath62-fields ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - densidades1 ] ) , the transition from inflation to the radiation - dominated era occurs smoothly , well before the @xmath61-field starts to oscillate about the minimum of its potential .",
    "therefore , the coherent oscillations of the @xmath61-field leave no imprint in gravitational - wave spectrum in the mhz / ghz range of frequencies .",
    "in this work we have extended the analysis by anchordoqui , goldberg , nawata and nuez based on the salam - sezgin supergravity theory , by including the inflationary period in the evolution .",
    "the salam - sezgin potential contains two scalar fields , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . assuming sufficient dissipative coupling",
    ", it follows that a period of warm inflation takes place , driven by the @xmath61-field , during which energy is being transferred continuously from both scalars to a radiation fluid .",
    "well after the end of the inflationary period , with the universe already dominated by the energy density of the radiation fluid , the dissipative coefficients are switched off and the @xmath61-field begins a period of quick oscillations around the minimum of the potential , behaving like cold dark matter with a varying mass .",
    "the @xmath62-field , which behaves like dark energy , becomes then practically constant until very near the present epoch , when it begins to dominate the energy content of the universe .",
    "we have shown , therefore , that within the salam - sezgin cosmological model is possible to obtain a unified description of inflation , dark matter , and dark energy .",
    "for an appropriate choice of the parameters of the model , we were able to account for the observed values of radiation , matter , and dark - energy density parameters .",
    "however , only approximately 6% of the total matter content of the universe was obtained from the @xmath61-field , while , according to observational data , one would expect dark matter to amount to about 80% of the total matter content . even if not entirely successful in this respect , it is not unreasonable to expect that more sophisticated models , based on supergravity and superstring theories , could be found that may generate enough dark matter and dark energy in a fully unified description .",
    "we have also calculated the full gravitational - wave spectrum of the salam - sezgin cosmological model .",
    "using the formalism of the continuous bogoliubov coefficients , we have shown that this spectrum has a non - constant negative slope in the frequency range @xmath0 , and that , contrarily to cosmological models in which standard ( cold ) inflation is followed by a preheating and/or reheating stage , the gravitational - wave spectrum shows no structure in the mhz / ghz range of frequencies .",
