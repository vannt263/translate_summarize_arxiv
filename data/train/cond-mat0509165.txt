    "advances in fabrication and processing of semiconductor materials on the nanoscale are presently enabling the realization of deep submicron and nanoscale semiconductor structures and devices . at these ultrasmall length scales , finite size effects , hot - electrons ,",
    "ballistic transport and microscopic doping variations are important in determining transport properties .",
    "in addition , these systems can be very easily brought out - of - equilibrium , as very high fields are established even for low applied bias voltages .",
    "the physics of electron transport in ultrasmall semiconductor systems is thus very rich as well as complex .",
    "drift - diffusion approaches as well as approximations based on a drifted - maxwell - boltzmann distribution break down and an adequate treatment of the nonequilibrium distribution function is needed .",
    "in particular , the high - energy tail of the distribution can have complex features that are determined by the scattering processes and the electrostatics within the systems as shown experimentally in raman spectroscopy measurements of the electron distribution in submicron , inhomogeneous iii - v systems.@xcite these experiments have shown far - from - equilibrium features such as strongly broadened velocity distributions and interesting high - velocity tail structure.@xcite    theoretically , there have been a few recent works that have shown that high - velocity structure in the distribution function can be attributed to ballistic effects . in a recent paper by us,@xcite",
    "we discussed the spatial dependence of the distribution function in deep submicron gaas channels and showed how quasi - ballistic signatures manifest as a broadening and high - velocity tail structure , as seen in the experiments .",
    "we also analyzed microscopic features of scattering in the channel region in the presence of energy - dependent scattering due to polar - optical phonons .",
    "interesting similar analyses with or without the inclusion of finite scattering have also been previously reported within the same theoretical frameworks.@xcite    the scattering problem in submicron and nanoscale channels is complicated since scattering and the electrostatic response of the system constitute a strongly coupled physical problem that creates a self - consistent feedback and an interesting charge redistribution . since pure ballistic transport is not attainable at room temperature in the presence of finite scattering@xcite and thus , the transport in submicron systems is quasi - ballistic to a varying degree , it is interesting to ask : what are the signatures of nonequilibrium and quasi - ballistic transport in quantities other than the electron distribution , such as electron density , potential energy and how can one separate the ballistic contribution to the problem and study its influence on the total quantities ? more importantly , what constitutes the crossover between diffusive and quasi - ballistic transport and how does it manifest on a microscopic level ?    in this paper we report on a detailed study of the crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport in ( sub)micrometer scale semiconductor channels , in particular investigating how this crossover manifests in the electrostatic response of the system , the electron redistribution within the channel region , the contribution of ballistic electrons to the total electron density , and the nonequilibrium electron distribution function .",
    "our theoretical and computational framework is based on a self - consistent solution of the boltzmann and poisson equations,@xcite which enables us to calculate nonequilibrium electron distributions and corresponding moments , as well as the accurate electrostatic reponse .",
    "we identify that , for the gaas system that we study , with a given doping profile and at room - temperature , a crossover to quasi - ballistic transport occurs for channel lengths smaller than @xmath0 @xmath1 m . in the electrostatics ,",
    "the crossover manifests as as redistribution of the potential drop from the channel to the contact regions , for decreasing channel lengths . in the electron density , which we study by separating components with different velocity , we observe interesting spatial dependences reflecting the diffusive - to - ballistic crossover .",
    "finally , on a microscopic level , we examine the nonequilibrium electron distribution function and its phase - space dependence around the crossover regime .",
    "the presented results provide insight into the role of scattering , ballistic transport and electrostatics in the transport properties of deep submicron and nanoscale semiconductor systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we give a brief introduction to the theoretical model in section [ model ] , referring the reader to ref .   for further details .",
    "next , we will present our results and discussion , first presenting an introduction to the basic signatures of quasi - ballistic transport in section [ basics ] .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport in section [ crossover ] .",
    "we conclude and summarize our main results in section [ summary ] .",
    "a microscopic study of the kinetics of quasi - ballistic transport in ultra - small inhomogeneous semiconductor structures requires in principle the solution of the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) .",
    "in addition , in order to capture the full physical picture , the bte needs to be solved self - consistently with the poisson equation .",
    "this is a very difficult task since the bte is a nonlinear , integro - differential equation for the semiclassical distribution function , @xmath2 , which in principle has seven dimensions .",
    "although the monte carlo method has been very popular and successful for the solution of the bte in semiconductor device simulation,@xcite several works@xcite have recently solved the bte by direct methods . this allows noise - free spatial and temporal resolution of the electron distribution function , which in the monte carlo method may be difficult to obtain due to the statistical nature of the approach .    in our model ,",
    "the electron transport is described by the following one - dimensional bte@xcite within the relaxation time approximation    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the effective mass in the parabolic band approximation and where we have assumed that the nonequilibrium electron distribution relaxes to a local equilibrium distribution , @xmath5 , which we in the following assume to describe non - degenerate statistics according to the following normalized maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution    @xmath6 ^{1/2}\\exp \\left [   -\\frac{m^{\\ast } v^{2}}{2k_{b}t}\\right ] ,   \\label{mb}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the local electron density , and @xmath8 is the lattice temperature .",
    "the electron density is obtained from the full electron distribution according to    @xmath9    the bte , eq .",

    "we assume that our system is unipolar and hence , that the poisson equation is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a given inhomogeneous doping distribution profile and @xmath12 is the dielectric constant",
    ".    equations ( [ bte]-[poisson ] ) are coupled through the electron density and electric field , and thus , they need to be solved self - consistently .",
    "we use a numerical approach based on finite difference and relaxation methods , the details of which can be found in ref .. as boundary conditions , we adopt the following scheme : for the potential , the values at the system boundaries , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are fixed to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , corresponding to an externally applied voltage @xmath17 .",
    "the electron density is allowed to fluctuate around the system boundaries subject to the condition of global charge neutrality , which is enforced between each successive iteration in the self - consistent poisson - boltzmann loop .",
    "the size of the highly - doped contacts is chosen to be large enough such that the electron density is constant deep inside the contacts .",
    "in addition , the size of the contacts has to be large enough , such that the electric field deep in the contacts is constant , and very low .",

    ". a more detailed description and discussion of our numerical method can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the following , we will present and discuss our main results .",
    "first , we will discuss some basic signatures of quasi - ballistic transport , followed by a study of the crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport .",
    "our model structure consists of a lightly doped region ( hereafter called the channel ) , with doping concentration @xmath24 m@xmath25 , sandwiched between two highly doped semiconductor contact regions with doping concentration @xmath26 m@xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the entire @xmath27 structure consists of gaas , and use the appropriate parameters in the calculations ( effective mass @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the bare electron mass , and dielectric constant @xmath30 ) . unless otherwise indicated , we assume that the lightly doped channel region is 200 nm long .",
    "in addition , all of our calculations are performed at @xmath31 k , using a scattering time of @xmath32 ps , which corresponds to a realistic scattering time due to polar optical phonon scattering.@xcite the microscopic effects of an energy - dependent scattering mechanism have been previously studied in ref .  .",
    "the description of transport in submicron , inhomogeneous semiconductor structures such as the ones described in our paper is a complicated process due to _",
    "i ) _ the size of the system , _ ii ) _ the inhomogeneous field distribution , _ iii ) _ the strongly non - equilibrium and quasi - ballistic nature of the problem , _",
    "iv ) _ the self - consistent feedback between the scattering processes and electrostatics . in the following , we will discuss some general properties of our model @xmath27 structure , which are valid for a wide range of ultrasmall , inhomogeneous semiconductor structures and devices .",
    "some of these results have been previously discussed by us in ref . .    in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) the electron potential energy ( solid line ) and electric field ( dotted line ) are shown for a @xmath27 structure with dimensions 2.9/0.2/2.9 @xmath33 m , for an applied bias voltage of @xmath34 v. the potential energy has a very slow spatial dependence in the large contacts resulting in only @xmath35 of the voltage drop occuring within the contact regions .",
    "in contrast , most of the potential drops over the lightly doped , deep submicron channel region , resulting in a dramatic spatial variation . correspondingly , a large field build - up , with opposite sign , occurs at the @xmath36 interfaces , a strongly inhomogeneous electric field is observed in the channel region , and in contrast , the field in the contacts is very small and constant , thus validating the assumption of a near - equilibrium solution to the bte  at the system boundaries .",
    "the observed strong spatial dependence of the electron potential energy and electric field in the channel region is due to the carrier diffusion induced by the large variation in doping concentration.@xcite",
    "+    in addition to the electrostatic picture discussed above , valuable information can be obtained from the carrier distribution within the system for a given applied external field and inhomogeneous doping profile . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to study the separate contributions , @xmath37 due to electrons with @xmath38 ( hereafter denoted as @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 due to electrons with @xmath41 ( hereafter denoted as @xmath42 ) , to the total electron density@xmath43 in addition we also introduce and study the `` ballistic '' electron density,@xmath44which corresponds to the density of electrons with energies higher than the top of the potential barrier between the source contact and the channel [ occurring at @xmath45 in fig .

    "[ figure1](b ) the electron densities @xmath49 ( dashed line ) , @xmath50 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath51 ( solid line ) , i.e. , the total electron density , are shown for the structure with the same parameters as discussed in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) .",
    "in addition , we show the spatial dependence of the surplus of electrons with velocities @xmath39 relative to the total electron density , @xmath52 ( dashed - dotted line ) , which can be viewed as a `` polarization '' of the electrons in velocity space .",
    "several observations are made : first , the total electron density , @xmath53 , displays an asymmetric spatial dependence with respect to the direction of transport , indicating a pile - up of charge at the source - channel interface .",
    "second , it is seen that the difference between the two densities , @xmath54 , has a significant spatial dependence , and that the minimum of the electron density components occurs at different points along the channel .",
    "furthermore , @xmath55 attains its maximum around mid - channel .    one can view the above results within the following intuitive picture : as electrons are injected from the source contact into the channel , they scatter at a rate given by @xmath56 . however , the mean free path of the @xmath39 and @xmath42 electrons is significantly different due to the large built - in electric fields around the channel region , giving rise to a considerable enhancement of the @xmath49 component of the density in comparison to the @xmath50 .",
    "the latter on the contrary is suppressed since , _",
    "i ) _ electrons injected from the drain have to overcome a large potential barrier , _ ii ) _ source - injected electrons scattered from the @xmath49 contribution and back to the @xmath50 contribution of the density have a relatively short mean free path due to the built - in field that exerts a force in the opposite direction and thus , quickly scatter back to the @xmath49 component .",
    "the spatial dependence of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath57 indicates that the efficiency of the scattering is non - uniform within the channel .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the previously defined `` ballistic '' electron density , @xmath58 , and compare with the above shown results for the electron densities calculated from the entire velocity range . in fig .",
    "[ figure1](c ) the thick solid and dashed lines correspond to the @xmath39 , and @xmath42 components ( which we in the following denote by @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) of @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we also show the `` ballistic '' electron fractions @xmath61 ( thin dotted line ) , and @xmath62 ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "to the left of the source - channel interface at @xmath63 @xmath33 m , the two components , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , have a slow spatial dependence and are only slightly different in value , reflecting the small field that is present in the source region . around @xmath64 , corresponding to the top of the potential barrier",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) ] , the two components rapidly split , and @xmath59 peaks at the barrier top , as expected by the pile - up of source - electrons at the interface , where interestingly , only @xmath6580@xmath66 of the total density consists of electrons with positive velocity as seen in @xmath61 . since the potential barrier seen by the drain - injected electrons from the right is far too large compared to @xmath67 to explain the large @xmath60 component at @xmath45 in terms of thermionically injected electrons from the drain , the main contribution to that component consists of backscattered source injected electrons .",
    "this is consistent with the interesting analyses by sano@xcite in which it was shown mathematically that , due to the singular nature of the bte ( note , that the analyses was made for the bte in the relaxation time approximation ) , a finite @xmath60 around the top of the barrier separating the source and the channel region , is always present provided there is a finite scattering rate .",
    "the intuitive physical picture is that , electrons close to the conduction band edge can have an infinitely small velocity , and thus can spend long enough time to experience a scattering event .",
    "if electrons incident from the source experience a sharp potential rise around the barrier , electrons pile up close to the conduction band edge and are successively slowed down , thus increasing the time spent around the barrier region , and correspondingly giving rise to a significant contribution in @xmath60 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath50 becomes larger the larger the curvature of the potential energy around the barrier region.@xcite    beyond the location of the top of the barrier , for @xmath68 , @xmath60 drops rapidly within the channel region , followed by a change in the slope past the channel - drain interface .",
    "the positive component , @xmath59 , on the other hand , has a much slower decay within the channel region , followed by a similar change of decay rate at the channel - drain interface as seen in @xmath60 .",
    "we note that @xmath59 is two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath60 at the channel - drain interface showing that , indeed there are very few drain - injected electrons at kinetic energies comparable to the potential barrier at the source - channel interface .",
    "a simple exponential fit to @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the channel region shows that the mean free paths of electrons with @xmath69 and @xmath41 are @xmath70 and 50 nm , respectively .",
    "hence , source - injected electrons have a mean free path comparable to the channel region and , thus , propagate quasi - ballistically .",
    "however , inspite of the quasi - ballistic transport of these electrons , their relative contribution to the total electron density in the drain is very small , as shown by the thin dashed and thin dashed - dotted line representing @xmath61 and @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ figure1](c ) .",
    "as expected , the fractions @xmath61 and @xmath62 reach their maximum at the barrier top and subsequently decrease monotonically in the channel .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath62 has an exponential - like decay rate , indicative of diffusive - like transport , in contrast to @xmath61 which decays almost linearly .",
    "full information about the microscopic details of the electron transport is contained in the nonequilibrium electron distribution function , to which we have access through our self - consistent solution of the bte . in fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) we show the normalized electron distribution function , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the thermal velocity and @xmath73 is the electron density at @xmath74 , calculated at different locations : one point in the source contact , four points along the channel region , and one point in the drain contact [ same as arrows in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) ] .",
    "the electron distribution shows a strong spatial dependence , and a far - from - equilibrium form at all but two of the spatial points depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) , namely the ones in the contacts .",
    "the thick dashed curve , corresponding to the distribution at @xmath75 @xmath33 m , is nearly maxwellian , showing that the electrons at that point are near equilibrium .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that @xmath76 is situated in the contact region , where the field is very small and constant [ see figs .  [",
    "figure1](a ) and [ figure2](b ) ] and thus , the electrons are distributed according to a shifted mb distribution , as given by the linear response solution to the bte , eq .",
    "( [ linbte ] ) .",
    "the electron distributions at @xmath77 on the other hand are highly asymmetric , displaying a strong weight toward positive velocities , as well as pronounced structure in the high - velocity tail for @xmath39 . at @xmath78 @xmath33 m ,",
    "the dotted curve shows the electron distribution at the top of the potential barrier between the source and channel regions .",
    "the distribution is distorted from a gaussian - like mb distribution and shows a suppression of electrons in the @xmath41 tail of the distribution as expected since , intuitively , only electrons injected from the source , with positive velocities , should be present .",
    "the presence of a negative - velocity tail in the distribution at the top of the potential barrier is again in accordance with our discussion above and the findings of sano,@xcite showing that significant backscattering occurs around the barrier region due to the sharp potential barrier and corresponding pile - up of electrons at the conduction band edge resulting in an increased backscattering efficiency due to the prolongued dwell time in the barrier vicinity .    beyond the barrier top ,",
    "the peak of the distribution rapidly shifts toward higher velocities and is significantly broadened ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "in addition , beyond the channel half - point , the low - velocity contribution of the distribution function increases , and a second peak emerges , as seen in the dash - dotted line , corresponding to @xmath80 @xmath81 m . at @xmath82 @xmath1 m ,",
    "the low - velocity peak dominates and only a shoulder is observed on the high - velocity side of the non - equilibrium distribution .",
    "finally , at @xmath83 @xmath1 m , i.e. , in the drain contact , the distribution function again assumes a near - equilibrium form .",
    "note however that a high - velocity tail is still observable , and the distribution function , although closely resembling a shifted mb distribution , is significantly different from the one at @xmath84 .    a contour plot of @xmath85 around the channel region is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) and further illustrates the general features .",
    "the emergence of a narrow peak and its rapid shift toward high velocities for @xmath68 are clearly seen .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the points @xmath84-@xmath86 corresponding to the curves in fig .  [ figure2](a ) and the arrows in the potential energy in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) .",
    "the observed features are a signature of _ quasi - ballistic transport_. the high - velocity peak in the distribution corresponds to _ ballistic _ electrons which , initially injected over the source - channel barrier , due to the rapid and large ( compared to @xmath67 )  potential drop and corresponding strong inhomogeneous electric field , are accelerated to high ( positive ) velocities . as discussed before , in the process , the mean free path of backscattered electrons is strongly reduced by the large electric field , and thus , the `` ballistic '' peak reaches very high velocities , and penetrates deep into the channel region , as seen in figs .",
    "[ figure2](a ) and [ figure2](b ) .",
    "however , in addition to the narrow `` ballistic '' peak , a broad distribution of electrons occupy the low and negative velocity part of the phase space .",
    "this component of the distribution function becomes more and more pronounced beyond the channel mid - point .",
    "the origin of this broadening at the drain end of the channel is due to electrons with @xmath41 , injected from a near - equilibrium distribution in the drain contact which penetrate the channel and contribute to the negative and low velocity components of the distribution function . within the channel ,",
    "the inhomogeneous electric field causes a non - uniform dependence of the mean free paths of the @xmath49 and @xmath40 components of the electron density , as discussed previously , which in turn creates a feedback to the electrostatics due to the charge ( re)distribution .",
    "it is thus evident from figs .",
    "[ figure2](a ) and figure2(b ) that the microscopic details of the influence of scattering in a submicron channel can be obtained only from the full non - equilibrium distribution function , which can only be obtained by the self - consistent solution of the bte .      in the following",
    ", we will discuss the crossover between the quasi - ballistic and diffusive regimes of transport in terms of numerical calculations and a study of the microscopic signatures discussed above .",
    "we will focus on the quantities discussed in the previous section and investigate their dependence on an externally applied bias voltage , as well as the dependence on the channel length .",
    "we have performed calculations for different structures with channel lengths ranging between 0.2 to 4 @xmath33 m . in order to exclude the influence of finite contact size on the results , we have performed and compared studies using two definitions of the channel length variations . in one case , which we simply call the constant contact ( cc ) size case , we keep the size of the contacts fixed , while varying the channel length , thus effectively changing the total sample size . the second case , which we simply call the constant sample ( cs ) size case ,",
    "we assume that the total sample size is constant , such that the variation of the channel length effectively reduces the contact size . in both cases , as will be seen in the presented results , the contact sizes are found to be large enough not to influence the main features of our study .      in figs .",

    "the observed features in the electrostatic response are a _ signature of the crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport_.      next , we perform a similar study of the electron densities @xmath49 and @xmath50 , defined earlier in the text . in fig .

    "the two components are naturally centered , although slightly shifted from each other , around the channel mid - point .",
    "the slight shift is due to the fact that , as seen in fig.[figure3](a ) , the electric field is non - zero everywhere but at mid - channel , and anti - symmetric with respect to the channel center .",
    "hence , the electron distributions in each half of the channel consist of a slightly shifted mb distribution . in the channel half close to the source ,",

    "note , however , that the _ total _ electron density is entirely symmetric along the @xmath102-direction ( not shown here ) , as required since @xmath17=0 .",

    "in particular , the position of @xmath105 changes significantly with @xmath17 , whereas the position of @xmath107 is roughly bias independent , as indicated by the schematic lines in the figure .",
    "this is an indication that the efficiency of the scattering is different for the @xmath39 and @xmath42 electrons .",

    "we note that , throughout the presented bias voltage range , @xmath117 decays approximately linearly on both sides of the peak centered at the top of the potential barrier at the source - drain interface .",
    "the fraction of negative `` ballistic '' electrons , @xmath62 , on the other hand , has a faster , exponential - like decay on the drain side of the potential barrier , indicating diffusive - like transport .",
    "the length dependence of the ballistic fraction of electrons is found to show a distinct signature of the crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport , at similar channel lengths where the crossover was observed in the electrostatic response as well as the total electron density distribution .    in fig .",

    "interestingly , @xmath118 has similar decay lengths , relative to @xmath119 , and an almost vanishing contribution around mid - channel ( with the exception of the structure with @xmath95 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the diffusive nature of the transport of electrons with @xmath41 , since the resistance in the diffusive regime is linear with respect to the channel length .",
    "the positive velocity ballistic electron fraction @xmath117 on the other hand has : _ i ) _ a similar decay length and length dependence with @xmath118 for @xmath120 @xmath1 m , _ ii ) _ an increasing relative decay length for decreasing channel length , yielding a significant contribution throughout the full extension of the channel .",
    "more importantly , it is interesting to note the transition between an exponential - like dependence for long channel lengths , to an almost linear dependence at shorter channel lengths , as a function of the relative position , @xmath109 , within the channel region .",
    "we interpret this as yet another signature of the crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport .",
    "having discussed the signatures of the quasi - ballistic and diffusive regimes of transport in the electrostatic response and the electron density distribution we now direct our attention to the full nonequilibrium distribution function . in figs .",

    "this peak shifts rapidly toward higher velocities along the direction of transport and dominates the distribution function well into the second half of the channel , close to the drain side of the system . in the vicinity of the drain , however , as previously discussed , drain - injected electrons spill over into the channel and dominate the electron distribution .",
    "note however that the two contributions are well separated in phase - space and thus can be easily identified .",
    "as the bias voltage is decreased , the ballistic signatures become less pronounced .",

    "furthermore , a smoother transition occurs between the main peaks in the distribution on the source and drain side of the channel [ see fig .",
    "[ figure6](c ) ] indicating an increasingly diffusive character of the transport . in fig .  [ figure6](d ) , for @xmath100 v , the distribution is as expected symmetric along the direction of transport , but nevertheless reflects the inhomogeneous properties of the sample , as seen in the slightly shifted distributions around each of the two interfaces .    in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] we show the normalized electron distribution functions , calculated at @xmath34 v , and for the channel lengths @xmath95 , 0.8 , 1.4 , and 4 @xmath1 m .",

    ", it is clear that the quasi - ballistic features are persistent , although weaker , i.e. , lower maximum velocity and extension into the channel region ( relative to the channel length ) , as well as a smaller separation between the drain- and source - injected electron distributions .",
    "note again that we plot the results against @xmath109 and that here , the ballistic peak extends over 300 nm into the channel .    for @xmath125 @xmath1 m ,",
    "the distribution function shows significantly reduced ballistic features . at this channel length , there is no clear formation of a ballistic peak as in the previous cases .",
    "furthermore , the distribution has comparable width , only one dominant peak throughout the entire channel region and a smooth connection between the near - equilibrium source and drain distributions .",
    "this indicates that the transport is close - to - diffusive . for longer channels ,",
    "the electron distribution becomes even more featureless as the transport becomes more and more diffusive . in fig .",
    "[ figure7](d ) , the distribution function for a @xmath120 @xmath1 m channel based system is shown for comparison .",
    "no ballistic features are present , the velocities are low in comparison to the previous cases and the distribution in the channel region , although broadened and shifted due to the increased fields , is close to the electron distributions in the source and drain contacts . for channel lengths shorter than @xmath119=1.4 @xmath1 m we have , however , seen a transition toward an increasingly ballistic regime of transport , with features resembling the ones shown in figs .",
    "[ figure7](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in summary , we have performed a detailed microscopic study of quasi - ballistic transport in deep submicron semiconductor channels . in particular",
    ", we studied the crossover between the quasi - ballistic and diffusive regimes of transport and identified signatures in the electrostatic response , electron density and full , nonequilibrium electron distribution function , that are due to ballistic transport .",
    "the study was performed by numerically solving the coupled , nonequilibrium boltzmann - poisson system of equations , using a self - consistent direct method developed by us , that enables us to obtain noise - free electron distributions throughout the interesting submicron channel regions .",
    "semiconductor systems on the deep submicron and nanometer scale can in general very easily be brought out of equilibrium due to their reduced dimensionality .",
    "as shown in our model structures , even for moderately downscaled channels and realistic doping levels , the built - in fields are high and have a very strong spatial dependence .",
    "electron transport subject to these fields is therefore highly out - of - equilibrium and drift - diffusion approaches break down .",
    "our self - consistent calculations of the electron distribution function in submicron gaas channels using the boltzmann - poisson equations show that the electron distribution is radically different from a shifted maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the distribution is far from gaussian - shaped , has a large broadening , and displays pronounced features , peaks and shoulders in the high - velocity tail of the distribution .",
    "the high - velocity features are signatures of ballistic transport , which occur due to the large and strongly spatially varying electric fields .",
    "the large broadening and significant contribution to the negative - velocity component of the distribution are , however , in part due to backscattered electrons in the channel , and partly due to electrons injected from the drain .",
    "we performed an analysis of the spatial density distributions for electrons with positive and negative velocities , respectively .",
    "it was shown that the relative scattering efficiency varies within the channel region and gives rise to asymmetric density distributions for the forward and backward traveling electrons .",
    "we also defined and studied a `` ballistic '' electron density , corresponding to electrons with total energies higher than the energy of the top of the barrier at the source - channel interface .",
    "it was shown that the spatial dependence for the positive and negative velocity contributions to the total `` ballistic '' density is radically different .",
    "this is due to the large difference in the mean free path between the forward and backward traveling electrons caused by the strong built - in electric field .",
    "it was shown that a significant number of the source - injected `` ballistic '' electrons reach the channel - drain interface and propagate into the drain .",
    "the relative fraction of ballistic electrons in the drain is , however , very low due to the orders of magnitude higher electron density in the drain contact .",
    "we have shown how these signatures are affected by an externally applied bias voltage , and more importantly by the length of the channel region .",
    "the effects of scattering have thereby explicitly been illustrated .",
    "in general , we have found that a crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport for the gaas structures with the given doping concentrations studied at room temperatures occurs around channel lengths @xmath126 @xmath1 m , which is far longer than the mean free path of @xmath127 nm determined by the thermal velocity , @xmath72 .",
    "the main parameters that influence this crossover are the effective mass , the scattering time and the details of the doping profile .",
    "hence , a full self - consistent treatment such as ours is needed to accurately model the crossover between the two regimes of transport .    in the electrostatic response",
    "we found that the crossover manifests as a redistribution of the voltage drop between the contacts and the channel region .",
    "for large channel lengths , the transport is diffusive and the majority of the potential drop occurs across the channel region . for channel lengths smaller than @xmath0 @xmath1",
    "m a monotonic redistribution of the potential drop from the channel region to the contacts occurs , and a crossover between the two fractions occurs around @xmath128 @xmath1 m , beyond which , for decreasing channel lengths , the majority of the potential drop occurs across the contact regions .",
    "similar crossovers were observed in the total and `` ballistic '' electron density distributions , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , as well as in the full , nonequilibrium distribution , @xmath131 . in particular , we note that that the spatial distribution of @xmath59 relative to @xmath109 has an increasingly larger decay length and more importantly shows a crossover between an exponential - like to a linear decay rate around channel lengths at which the crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport were observed in the electrostatic response .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath60 , however , has a relatively similar spatial distribution for different channel lengths , relative to @xmath119 , and displays exponential - like decay indicative of diffusive transport . on a microscopic level",
    ", we also showed explicitly how the signatures of the crossover manifest in the nonequilibrium electron distribution , @xmath131 .",
    "in general , scattering and quasi - ballistic transport in ultrasmall semiconductor channels exhibit complex features due to the inherent nonlocal nature of the problem .",
    "our study has provided insight into the microscopic signatures of the problem as well as of the crossover between the diffusive and quasi - ballistic regimes of transport .",
    "we note that some of the features reported in this paper resemble experimental observations that may be explained within the presented physical picture .",
