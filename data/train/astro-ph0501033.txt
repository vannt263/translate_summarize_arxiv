    "the study of ultra high energy upward and horizontal @xmath8 air showers produced by @xmath8 neutrino interactions within the earth crust has been considered in recent years as an alternative way to detect high energy neutrinos . the problem of @xmath8 neutrinos crossing the earth is indeed quite complicated because of the complex terrestrial neutrino opacity at different energies and angles of arrival .",
    "in addition , several factors have to be taken into account , such as the amount of energy transferred in the @xmath9 - @xmath8 lepton conversion , as well as the @xmath8 energy losses and interaction lengths at different energies and materials .",
    "this makes the estimate of the links between the input neutrino - output @xmath8 air shower very difficult .",
    "such a prediction is further complicated by the existence of a long list of theoretical models for the incoming neutrino fluxes ( gzk neutrinos , z - burst model flux , @xmath10 flat spectra , agn neutrinos , topological defects ) .",
    "many authors have investigated this @xmath11 signature , however the results are varied , often in contradiction among themselves , and the expected rates may range over a few orders of magnitude ( fargion , aiello , & conversano 1999 ; fargion 2002 ; bertou et al .",

    "2004 ; jones et al . 2004 ; yoshida et al . 2004 ) .",
    "so far , the majority of the current studies on this topic is based on monte - carlo simulations assuming a particular model of the incoming neutrino flux .",
    "some author have chosen ad hoc the crossing depth of the tau ; other considered ad hoc maximal distance for the tau in flight .",
    "most of the authors focus on the uptaus tracks in underground detectors . in previous works",
    "we have presented a very simple analytical and numerical derivation ( as well as its more sophisticated extensions ) which takes into account , for any incoming angle , the main processes related to the neutrinos and @xmath8 leptons propagation and the @xmath8 energy losses within the earth crust ( see fargion et al",
    ". 2004a , fargion et al .",
    "2004b for details ) .",
    "our numerical results are constrained by upper and lower bounds derived in more simple and tested approximations .",
    "we have shown how the effective volumes and masses are more severely reduced at high energy and we included as a further constraint the role of the air dilution at high altitude , where @xmath8 decay and the consequent air - shower may ( or may not ) take place .",
    "we showed ( fargion et al .",
    "2004a ) that our results give an estimate of the @xmath8 air - shower event rates that exceeds earliest studies but they were comparable or even below more recent predictions ( yoshida et al .",
    "2004 ) . secondly , we pointed out that the consequent @xmath6 , @xmath12 , @xmath2 signature of hortaus largely differs from that of horizontal uhecr backgrounds ( fargion et al .",
    "+ in this paper we introduce in the calculation of the number of events an additional suppression factor related to the altitude at which air showers are observed .",
    "this guarantees the optimal extension and the largest flux for the shower to be detected at each observational @xmath13 altitude .",
    "in particular we apply all our previous results to the calculation of the expected number of events at different altitudes in the atmosphere , with a particular attention to the euso telescope .",
    "euso is a space born detector that will be located at an altitude of about 400 km on the international space station ( iss ) , aimed at the the detection of uhecr .",
    "it consists of a wide angle uv telescope that will look downwards towards the earth atmosphere to detect the fluorescence signals induced by uhecr showers in the atmosphere .",
    "its aperture is such to cover a surface as large as @xmath14 km , therefore it will encompass agasa - hires and auger areas .",
    "euso is scheduled to be launched in the 2009 .",
    "its ability to observe within the down ward atmosphere layer the long tracks of horizontal showers may show their peculiar opening , by geomagnetic fields , into three main fingers defined by their charges : ( muon and electron pairs of opposite charge bent in opposite arcs and rectilinear @xmath2 paths for tens and hundreds of km distances ) .",
    "to calculate the effective volume we assume that the neutrino traversing the earth is transformed in a tau lepton at a depth @xmath15 , after having travelled for a distance ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the column depth @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 , the integral of the density @xmath19 of the earth along the neutrino path at a given angle @xmath20 is shown in fig .",

    "the angle @xmath20 is included between the neutrino arrival direction and the tangent plane to the earth at the observer location ( @xmath21 corresponds to a beam of neutrinos tangential to the earth s surface ) and it is complementary to the nadir angle at the same location .",

    "as we will show in the next section , the probability for the outcoming @xmath8 to emerge from the earth keeping its primary energy @xmath25 is @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath24 at energy @xmath29 ev ) . by the interaction length",
    "@xmath30 we mean the characteristic length for neutrino interaction ; as we know its value may be associated to the inverse of the total cross - section @xmath31 , including both charged and neutral current interactions .",
    "it is possible to show that using the @xmath32 in the @xmath23 factor includes most of the @xmath33 regeneration along the neutrino trajectory making simpler the mathematical approach ( fargion et al .",
    "+ the effective volume per unit surface is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is any arbitrary surface above the corresponding effective volume .",
    "for instance this expression has been first estimated for all the earth . in this case",
    "a is just half of the terrestrial surface , due to the request of selecting only the upward direction . under the assumption that the @xmath15 depth is independent of @xmath30 and @xmath36 ,",
    "the above integral becomes :    @xmath37 where the energy of the neutrino @xmath22 has been expressed as a function of @xmath38 via the introduction of the parameter @xmath39 , the fraction of energy transferred from the neutrino to the lepton . at energies greater than @xmath40",

    "all 2004a ) ) . once the effective volume is found , we introduce an effective mass defined as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the density of the outer layer of the earth crust : @xmath45 ( water ) and @xmath46 ( rock ) .",
    "+ the expression of the effective volume in the most general case becomes ( see fargion et al 2004 for details )    @xmath47    where the interaction length @xmath48 ( shown in fig .",

    "2004 for a more detailed discussion of @xmath48 ) . + we remind that the total neutrino cross section @xmath50 consists of two main component , the charged current and neutral current terms , but the @xmath51 production depends only on the dominant charged current whose role will appear later in the event rate number estimate .",
    "the interaction lengths @xmath52 , @xmath53 depends on the energy , but one should be careful on the energy meaning . here",
    "we consider an incoming neutrino with energy @xmath54 , a prompt @xmath51 with an energy @xmath55 at its birth place , and a final outgoing @xmath51 escaping from the earth with energy @xmath56 , after some energy losses inside the crust . the final @xmath51 shower energy , which is the only observable quantity , is nearly corresponding to the latter value @xmath56 because of the negligible @xmath57 energy losses in air . however we must be able to infer @xmath58 and the primary neutrino energy , @xmath22 , to perform our calculation .",

    "the assumption on the flux may be changed at will and the event number will scale linearly according to the model .",
    "[ eusoevent ] we show the expected number of event for euso where we have included the earth s atmosphere and we have used @xmath48 , so that we may express the results as a function of the final @xmath8 lepton energy . + as one can see from fig .",

    "moreover this muonic shower would have a significant @xmath2 component , with a high number of photons - @xmath87 ( cillis & sciutto 2001 ; see also fig . 15 in cronin 2004 ) - because of the @xmath8 decay channels into both charged and neutral pions .",
    "+ on the other hand , horizontal uhecrs will not represent a source of contamination for our signal because the horizontal @xmath2 s produced in the hadronic shower inside the atmosphere would be exponentially suppressed at large slant depth ( @xmath88 g @xmath63 ) and large zenith angles ( @xmath89 ) ( cillis & sciutto 2001 ) . only @xmath1 can survive when propagating through the atmosphere at large zenith angles .",
    "such muons would also be source of parasite @xmath2 signal - due to the @xmath3 pair produced in the @xmath1 decay in flight - but the gamma - to - muon - number ratio would be now approximately @xmath90 1 .",
    "+ therefore , this difference would allow to distinguish gamma - rich hortaus from common horizonal gamma - poor uhecr events to reveal uhe earth - skimming @xmath9 s .",
    "+ for a more precise approach to the calculation of the rate of events one has also to take into account that the number of events varies as a function of the height @xmath13 at which the observer is located to detect the muonic , electronic and gamma shower .",
    "therefore we introduce an additional factor    @xmath91 where the parameter @xmath92 that we have introduced as    @xmath93    defines the optimal height where the shower can reach its maximal extension at the corresponding energy @xmath38 .",
    "this is the sum of the height reached by the @xmath8 in the atmosphere before its decay ( @xmath94 ) , where we have neglected @xmath8 energy losses in the atmosphere , and the altitude reached by the secondary particles of the shower which is related to the parameter @xmath95 .",

    "here we have considered the air density @xmath98 g @xmath99 constant and equal to the value at the sea level . at low energies ( @xmath40 - @xmath100 ev )",
    "the second term is dominant and @xmath67 can be considered as constant because the @xmath8 lepton travels for less than 1 km before it decays . at higher energy ( @xmath101 - @xmath102 ev )",
    "the first term is dominant , and we can neglect the way the exact value of @xmath67 changes with the altitude . in fig .",

    "we have performed this calculation assuming an input gzk neutrino flux and that the earth outer layer is made of rock ( left panel ) and water ( right panel ) .",
    "we show how the expected number of events increase with the altitude of the observer .",
    "in particular at @xmath103 40 - 20 km , roughly the altitude of the atmosphere layer where has or hortaus are expanding to maximal power and where euso is following the uhecr showers , the differential number flux of muons and electromagnetic showers reach already its maximal asymptotic value .",

    "again we show that at higher altitudes the muon , ( as well as the gamma flux ) from hortaus is high and that satellites orbiting around the earth at a few hundreds of kilometers may better search earth skimming tau - air showers secondaries , if they will turn their focus on the horizons edges of the earth , where they are mostly produced ( see fargion et all .",
    "horizontal showers from normal hadrons ( or gammas ) are strongly depleted of their electromagnetic component because of the large slant depth ( @xmath108 g @xmath63 ) , while horizontal tau air showers are not .",
