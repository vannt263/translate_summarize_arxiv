    "1987 ) , is probably among the best tracer of the dynamical mass in the galaxy . under the assumption of circular motion in an axisymmetric potential",
    ", the tangent point method allows in principle to derive the rotation curve inside the solar circle and to recover the spatial location of the spiral arms ( see the compilation of valle 1995 ) .    however , this approach is limited for at least two reasons related to the data themselves .",
    "first , it is long known ( rougoor & oort 1960 ) that the longitude - velocity ( @xmath1 ) distribution of the galactic gas reveals substantial diffuse and feature - like emission in the regions @xmath10 and @xmath11 close to the galactic centre which are forbidden to pure circular motion , the most popular example being the 3-kpc arm .",
    "second , bumps of about @xmath12  kms@xmath13 on the terminal velocity curves near the tangent points of the spiral arms reflect the gravitational perturbation of these arms on the gas flow and can propagate into distance errors of @xmath14  kpc along the line of sight if modeled by circular motion ( burton 1992 ; combes 1991 ) .",
    "traditional interpretations of the `` forbidden '' velocities near the centre involve explosion induced expansion ( van der kruit 1971 ; van der kruit et al .",
    "1972 ; cohen 1975 ; oort 1977 ) or gas moving on elliptical orbits in either a spiral ( shane  1972 ; simonson & mader 1973 ) or a barred potential ( peters 1975 ; cohen & few 1976 ; liszt & burton 1980 ; gerhard & vietri 1986 ) . in the last decade , the latter interpretation received strong support by direct evidence of a large scale stellar bar in the milky  way from near - ir surface photometry ( blitz & spergel 1991 ; dwek et al .",

    "1979 ; van albada 1985 ; mulder & liem 1986 ; athanassoula 1992 ; englmaier & gerhard 1997 ) have shown that the gas flow in a rapidly rotating barred potential is driven by strong shocks leading the bar major axis and followed downstream by enhanced gas densities . in external early - type ( i.e. sbc and earlier ) barred spirals ,",
    "these shocks are detected as offset dustlanes with very large velocity changes in the associated gas velocity field ( e.g. reynaud & downes 1998 ; laine et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "binney et al .  (",
    "1991 ) have interpreted the gas kinematics near the galactic centre approximating the gas streamlines by a sequence of closed @xmath4 and @xmath15 orbits ( contopoulos & mertz - anides 1977 ) , but such a model does not properly cares about the shocks .",
    "the hydro simulations designed for the milky  way ( mulder & liem 1986 ; wada et al .",
    "1994 ; englmaier & gerhard 1999 ; weiner & sellwood 1999 ) always assume rigid barred potentials and bisymmetry with respect to the galactic centre , but some details in the hi and co observations clearly betray important asymmetries : ( i ) about 3/4 of the molecular gas in the nuclear ring / disc lies at positive longitude , ( ii ) the 3-kpc arm and its far - side counterarm have very different absolute velocities at @xmath16 , and ( iii ) the positive and negative velocity peaks of bright emission , at @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , differ by roughly @xmath19",
    "kms@xmath13 in absolute velocity , and the emission of the nuclear ring / disc is also shifted towards receding velocities .",
    "moreover , as an sbbc galaxy ( sackett 1997 ) , the milky  way is also expected to present prominent dustlanes , but their gaseous traces have never been convincingly isolated in the hi and co data .",
    "this paper follows a first paper ( fux 1997 , hereafter paper  i ) where several @xmath0-body barred models of the galaxy have been built from bar unstable axisymmetric initial conditions , constraining the position of the observer relative to the bar with the cobe k - band data corrected for extinction by dust .",
    "the best matching models suggested an angle of @xmath20 for the bar inclination and a corotation radius of @xmath21  kpc .",
    "here we take advantage of these simulations to seek the most convenient initial conditions for much larger simulations , including a gas component treated by the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique and with no imposed symmetries .",
    "the resulting self - consistent gas flows are used to interpret the observed gas kinematics near the galactic plane , and more especially within the bar region .",
    "contrary to weiner & sellwood  ( 1999 ) , our approach is based on the observed bright @xmath1 features , and not on the mostly low density gas close to the terminal velocities , for which eulerian codes are more appropriate .    the structure of the paper is organised as follows : in sect .  2 we describe the main features appearing in the hi and co @xmath1 diagrams within the bar region .",

    "we set some new constraints on the bar parameters based on this interpretation .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "8 summarises our results . throughout the paper",
    ", we will adopt a solar galactocentric distance @xmath22  kpc .",
    "in the region @xmath23 several features stand out from the observed longitude - velocity distribution of both atomic and molecular gas ( see figs .",
    "[ lv ] and  [ lvb ] ) .",
    "the nomenclature of these features principally refers to rougoor  ( 1964 ) and we omit here the historical but confusing `` expanding '' qualification , since local radial motions do not necessarily imply a net flux when averaged over azimuth .",
    "other more exhaustive inventories of observed @xmath1 features can be found in van der kruit  ( 1970 ) and cohen  ( 1975 ) for the hi , and in bania  ( 1977 ) , bally et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and the review of combes  ( 1991 ) for the co.    * _ the 3-kpc arm_. this arm is the largest apparent feature , covering more than @xmath24 in galactic longitude , and with a `` forbidden '' radial velocity of @xmath25  kms@xmath13 at @xmath16 .",
    "it was discovered by van woerden et al .",
    "( 1957 ) and its name is related to the location of its tangent point near @xmath26 , corresponding to @xmath27 kpc ( at this time the galactocentric distance of the sun was assumed to be @xmath28  kpc ) .",
    "the same authors also noticed that this arm must lie in front of the galactic centre because of absorbing the continuum spectrum of radio sources close to the centre ( see the hi @xmath1 diagram at @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ lvb ] ) , which is consistent with its rather large latitudinal width .",
    "the 3-kpc arm can not be represented by a uniformly rotating and expanding circular arc over its whole longitude range ( burke & tuve 1964 ) .",
    "it was successfully modeled by mulder & liem  ( 1986 ) as a stationary density wave in a rotating barred potential . *",
    "_ the 135-kms@xmath13 arm_. this feature shows no absorption lines against galactic centre radio sources and is suspected to be the far - side counterpart of the 3-kpc arm ( e.g. oort 1977 ) .",
    "however it crosses the zero longitude axis at 135  kms@xmath13 ( hence his name ) , i.e. more than twice the absolute velocity of the 3-kpc arm , which is among the strongest evidence for an asymmetric spiral structure in the central few kpc ( velocity asymmetries at @xmath16 can not result from perspective effects ) .",
    "the 135-kms@xmath13 arm extends down to @xmath30 , where its radial velocity still reaches about @xmath31  kms@xmath13 , and lies slightly above the galactic plane , at @xmath32 .",
    "it also involves less hi mass than the 3-kpc arm and is more lumpy . * _ the connecting arm_. this is a very rarely discussed feature in the recent literature , despite its substantial brightness .",
    "it was probably mentioned the first time by rougoor & oort  ( 1960 ) .",
    "the origin of its name comes from the fact that it seems to link the nuclear ring / disc to the outer disc .",
    "it becomes easily identifiable in the hi and @xmath8co data near @xmath33 and @xmath34  kms@xmath13 , where it is located far below the plane at @xmath35 , and passes through the peak of the positive terminal velocity curve . in rougoor s  ( 1964 )",
    "description , this feature is doubtfully combined with another distinct feature extending at roughly constant velocity out to @xmath36 .",
    "the connecting arm was soon recognized as a very inclined spiral arm , i.e. with a high pitch angle , although its situation in front or behind the galactic centre remained unclear ( rougoor 1964 ; cohen & davies 1976 ) .",
    "kerr  ( 1967 ) adopted the latter alternative and interpreted this arm as part of a central gaseous bar . *",
    "_ the nuclear ring / disc _ , or _ central molecular zone_. concerns the offcentred dense molecular gas located within @xmath37 ,",
    "i.e. somewhat inside the positive and negative peaks of the terminal velocity curves ( see for instance the high resolution co @xmath1 maps in oort 1977 ; liszt & burton 1978 ; bally et al .",
    "1988 ; combes 1991 ; morris & serabyn 1996 and oka et al .",
    "the parallelogram bounding this structure is also called `` expanding molecular ring '' owing to its original interpretation ( scoville 1972 ; kaifu et al .",
    "1972 ) , and more recently `` 180-pc ring '' according to its size .",
    "the molecular complex enclosed by this ring forms a kind of disc rotating with a maximum velocity of order @xmath31  kms@xmath13 and is speculated to form two mini spirals ( sofue 1995 ) .",
    "almost the entire cs emission comes from this disc .",
    "binney et al .  (",
    "1991 ) have interpreted the parallelogram and the disc respectively as gas on the cusped @xmath4 orbit and on @xmath15 orbits in the bar potential ( see sect .  [ bin ] ) . an extensive review on this pattern",
    "is given by morris & serabyn  ( 1996 ) .",
    "* _ the molecular ring_. meant to represent a ring - like gas concentration with a radius of roughly @xmath38  kpc , the spatial distribution of this structure is in fact poorly known and could as well involve imbricated spiral arms .",
    "close to the positive terminal velocity curve , it forms two branches with tangent points at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath41  kpc and @xmath38  kpc .",
    "the molecular ring probably compares to the inner ( pseudo- ) rings seen in external spiral galaxies ( buta 1996 ) .",
    "all features listed here appear both in the co and hi data with a  rigorous coincidence in position , although the central molecular zone is much weaker in hi .",
    "it is not yet clear whether these features are transient or represent a permanent gas flow on closed orbits .",
    "bania  ( 1977 ) has also isolated two particular `` clumps '' in the @xmath8co data ( see fig .  [ lv ] ) , corresponding to massive molecular cloud complexes .    *",
    "_ clump  1 _ is located at the negative longitude end of the arm , at @xmath30 and @xmath42 , and represents the most extreme case of non - circular motion in the milky way s dense gas kinematics .",
    "it is located at slightly lower latitude than the nearby emission from the 135-kms@xmath13 arm .",
    "the clump  1 complex has been resolved into three distinct sub - complexes each of about @xmath43  @xmath44 h@xmath45 mass .",

    "@xmath8co @xmath51 emission line , other more transparent molecular tracer like @xmath8co @xmath52 ( oka et al .",
    "1998a ) , @xmath9co and cs ( bally et al .",
    "1987 ) , as well as hcn ( jackson et al . 1996 ; lee 1996 ) , have also been used to map dense gas like in the galactic centre region .",
    "the interpretation of features in the @xmath1 diagrams is subject to many difficulties .",
    "first , since only the radial component of the velocity is measured , the in - plane velocity field can be recovered directly only under very restrictive symmetry assumptions like axisymmetry .",
    "second , some features may not trace real spiral arms but be artifact of velocity crowding along the line of sight ( burton 1973 ; mulder & liem 1986 ) .",
    "third , features elongated in the velocity direction can be understood either by real structures elongated along the line of sight or by spatially localised emission with a very large velocity spread , as would result for example in a supernova explosion or in violent shocks . finally , some regions in the @xmath1 space overlay the emission from several distinct sources , in particular the low velocity emission from the galactic centre region is partly hidden by the emission from the surrounding disc spiral arms .",
    "this problem can however be addressed considering the latitudinal gas distribution or resorting to very dense gas tracers .",
    "optically thick regions are also strongly affected by absorption .",
    "the initial models are evolved using a composite @xmath0-body and hydro code developed by the geneva observatory galactic dynamic group , originally provided by d. friedli but considerably modified in the present application . at each time step , the gravitational forces on all particles ( gas included ) are derived by the particle - double mesh method detailed in sect .",

    "[ sph ] , and finally the phase space coordinates of each particle are updated by integration of the equations of motion according to the algorithm presented in sect .",
    "[ int ] .      to compute the gravitational forces on the particles , we have resorted as in paper i to the particle - mesh ( pm ) technique with polar - cylindrical grid geometry and variable homogeneous ellipsoidal kernel for the softening of the short range forces ( pfenniger & friedli 1993 ) . however , instead of using a single grid with constant vertical resolution , inappropriate to model efficiently the high density contrast between a thin disc and an extended dark halo , we have introduced a double embedded grid structure .",
    "the higher resolution grid  ( a ) has @xmath54 cells , with a maximum radial extent @xmath55 and a vertical spacing @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57",
    ". the lower resolution grid  ( b ) has half the number of cells in each dimension of the plane , skipping every second @xmath58- and @xmath59-grid point of the finer grid , and the same number of cells vertically but with a spacing of @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 . hence grid  b has the same radial extent than grid  a , but is larger in the vertical dimension .",
    "both grids have constant vertical spacing , thus allowing to keep the advantage of the fast fourier transform algorithm in this dimension . here",
    "@xmath62 designates the number of active cells in  @xmath63 , corresponding to half the value required by the doubling - up method ( hockney & eastwood 1981 ) .",
    "the vertical grid parameters are chosen to satisfy : @xmath64 ensuring that ( i ) there are grid points of each grid in the plane @xmath65 , ( ii ) the horizontal planes @xmath66 delimiting vertically grid  a also contain points of grid  b , and ( iii )  grid  b has at least four cells within grid  a in the @xmath63 dimension .",
    "figure  [ double1 ] gives an example of double grid fulfilling all these conditions .",
    "in this particle - double mesh ( or pm@xmath53 ) method , the mass assignment to the grid cells is repeated twice ( once for each grid ) , and the total potential involves the evaluation of three sub - potentials : @xmath67 and @xmath68 generated by the mass inside grids  a and b respectively , as well as @xmath69 generated by the mass within grid  b but outside grid  a. the potential @xmath67 is computed on grid  a , at high resolution , and the other potentials on grid  b. the total potential then amounts to @xmath70 in the region of grid  a , which requires an interpolation of @xmath69 to grid  a , and simply to @xmath68 outside this region .",
    "the increase of cpu time owing to the triple potential evaluation is amply compensated by the reduction by a factor @xmath71 of the effective number of cells relative to a single grid with the same resolution as grid  a and the same size as grid  b. the transition planes between the two grids are associated with numerical discontinuities in the force components , although quite small in practice ( see fig .",
    "[ double ] ) . to smooth them out , the forces in the first and last cells of grid  b within grid  a are taken as a linear combination so that the forces at @xmath66 coincide with the forces of grid  b and those at @xmath72 with the forces of grid  a.    the grid parameters adopted in our simulations are given in table  [ simul ] and the resulting gravitational resolution achieved with the high resolution double grid is depicted in fig .",

    "the pressure and viscous forces acting on the gas particles are derived by three - dimensional sph .",
    "we will not repeat here the principle of this very popular lagrangian method for solving euler s equation of motion ( see benz 1990 ; monaghan 1992 and steinmetz 1996 for reviews ) , but just give the necessary specifications about this part of our code .",
    "the relevant form of the euler equation writes : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the velocity field , @xmath75 the spatial mass density and @xmath76 the pressure of the gas .",
    "@xmath77 is the viscosity term and @xmath78 the gravitational force as obtained by the pm@xmath53 method .",
    "the internal properties of a classical fluid are fully described by three macroscopic independent variables of state , like for example the density and the pressure appearing explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) , and the internal energy per unit mass  @xmath79 .",
    "the density is evaluated directly at each particle position @xmath80 via : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of gas particles , @xmath83 the individual mass of the particles , @xmath84 the kernel function and @xmath85 the smoothing length . in sph , this equation is equivalent to the continuity equation expressing the conservation of total mass .    a first relation between the variables of state is given by the equation of state assuming a perfect gas , i.e. @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the adiabatic index of the gas , which from statistical mechanics is given by @xmath88 , with @xmath89 being the number of freedom degrees of the gas constituents ( @xmath90 for atomic hydrogen and @xmath91 for molecular hydrogen ) .",
    "a second relation comes from the energy conservation equation , which in its general form involves cooling and heating functions .",
    "since these functions are poorly constrained by theory , we have simply resorted to the isothermal assumption , i.e. the internal energy of the gas is at any time and everywhere the same .",
    "this assumption , partly justified by the homogeneous velocity dispersion of the warm gas component in external galaxies ( e.g. van der kruit & shostak 1984 ) , means that cooling and heating exactly cancel each other and that the energy released by the shocks is instantaneously radiated away .",
    "hence , introducing the ( constant ) sound speed @xmath92^{1/2}$ ] to substitute the internal energy , the equation of state for particle  @xmath93 reduces to : @xmath94 which is degenerated in sound speed and adiabatic index , depending only on the ratio @xmath95 . with this last equation , benz s  ( 1990 )",
    "sph version of the pressure term in euler s equation simply becomes : @xmath96    the empirical artificial viscosity is calculated exactly as in benz  ( 1990 ) .",
    "it consists of a superposition of the `` bulk '' and the von neumann - richtmyer viscosities , with the standard parameters set to @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and takes into account balsara s  ( 1995 ) correction to avoid energy dissipation in pure shearing flows .",

    "the gas does not always trace the full length of the axis shocks and hence it is not surprising that the emission from the connecting arm appears truncated at @xmath212 .",
    "the @xmath1 movies sometimes show gas lumps deposited by lateral arms in the near - side axis shock and moving precisely along the connecting arm feature .",
    "the time for the gas to travel from the endpoint of a lateral arm to the nuclear ring along the shock is of order @xmath213  myr and it takes about another @xmath214  myr for the gas not absorbed by the ring to encounter the opposite axis shock .",

    "[ region ] , the axis shock in the far - side of the bar is predicted as an almost vertical feature in the @xmath1 diagram , i.e. with @xmath217 constant . such a feature is indeed visible in the @xmath8co observations ( fig .  [ lv ] ) near @xmath218 , with only a marginal decrease of absolute longitude towards negative velocities .",
    "the longitude confinement comes from the fact that the shock line is nearly parallel to the line of sight and the velocity extension from the fact that the velocity of the gas along the shock rapidly increases when approaching the nuclear ring / disc .",
    "the 3-kpc and the 135-kms@xmath13 arms are lateral arms .",
    "the observed velocity asymmetry between these two arms happens because the latter passes closer to the centre than the former .",
    "the gas associated with the 135-kms@xmath13 arm , moving almost parallel to the arm ( fig .",
    "[ vfield ] ) , indeed falls deeper in the potential well of the nucleus and therefore reaches higher forbidden velocities before striking the dustlane shock .",
    "the observed velocity asymmetry of bright emission near the positive and negative terminal velocity peaks could have a related origin : the gas from the 3-kpc arm , after crossing the dustlane shock further out than its counterarm , starts to fall towards the nuclear ring / disc with a higher potential energy and therefore will approach the latter with higher velocities , producing an enhanced velocity peak .",
    "model l10t2540 however does not exhibit such a velocity asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry could also arise from a relative radial motion between the nuclear ring / disc and the lsr , produced either by the oscillations of the density centre ( see sect .",
    "[ stars ] ) or by a radial velocity component of the lsr with respect to the galactic centre , possibly induced by the bar itself ( raboud et al .",
    "1998 ) , or both .",
    "the inner branch of the molecular ring , with tangent point at @xmath39 , is the outer extension of the 135-kms@xmath13 arm .",
    "observations of the gas velocity field in external barred galaxies have revealed velocity changes up to @xmath219 kms@xmath13 across the bar leading dustlanes , demonstrating that these dustlanes are associated with very strong shocks .",
    "such velocity fields have been measured for example in ngc  6221 ( pence & blackman 1984 ) , ngc  1365 ( joersaeter & van moorsel 1995 ; lindblad et al .",

    "figure  [ shock ] shows how the gas velocity field is affected by the near - side branch of the axis shocks in model  l10t2066 .",
    "the shock occurs near @xmath220  kpc and is followed downstream by a huge gas concentration . both velocity components , parallel and perpendicular to the shock front , undergo an abrupt velocity gradient across the shock layer .",
    "the velocity change is however larger for the parallel component , reflecting the shearing nature of the axis shocks , and is comparable to the values observed in external galaxies . in ngc  1530 , reynaud & downes  ( 1998 ) found that the velocity change increases towards the nuclear ring , but this property is hard to infer from our models because the shock fronts are not well resolved in the low density part .",
    "bania s  ( 1977 ) clump 2  and an other vertical feature near @xmath221 ( see fig .",
    "[ lv ] ) could represent gas lumps which are just about to cross the near - side dustlane shock somewhere between the 3-kpc arm and the nuclear ring / disc : the upstream part still moves with the small quasi - apocentric velocities of the pre - shock orbits , while the downstream part has been accelerated to the high inwards post - shock velocities , giving rise to a steep radial velocity gradient ( fig .",
    "[ locate ] ) and a velocity stretch of over @xmath31  kms@xmath13 in the observations .",
    "contrary to the @xmath1 trace of the far - side dustlane shock , these features might be really concentrated in space and not result from an accumulation of gas along the line of sight . for the @xmath222 lump , this interpretation is supported by the fact that all emission from the lump originates at nearly constant latitude , as expected from a spatially confined source , and that the part of the connecting arm at the same longitude as the lump appears at almost the same latitude as the lump itself ( see fig .  [ lvb ] ) . furthermore , this lump also has a small mass relative to the connecting arm and will therefore essentially adapt its momentum to that of this arm . for clump  2 , with a mean latitude differing by more than @xmath223 from that of the connecting arm ( at similar @xmath224 ) and a total mass of nearly @xmath225  @xmath44 ( stark & bania 1986 ) , our interpretation is more speculative .",
    "however , if this clump is indeed close to the apocentre of its orbit , it will enter very slowly the shock line , where gas is moving at very high speed ( over @xmath219  kms@xmath13 ) , and thus receive a significant impulse when integrated over time .",
    "moreover , the clump complex may move on a kind of looped quasi-@xmath4 orbit and therefore will self - dissipate its energy if its size is comparable to that of the loops , whatever its mass . if the connecting arm indeed traces the near - side dustlane , the identification of clump  2 with such a dustlane , as proposed by stark & bania ( 1986 ) , is ruled out ( unless the milky  way has a double bar ) .",
    "but it should be noted that the axis shock assigned to the connecting arm in model l10t2540 can produce an @xmath1 trace resembling much more that of clump  2 if the bar inclination angle is reduced to @xmath226 ( see fig .",
    "[ other ] ) .",
    "clump  1 , composed of several clouds which are not bound to each other ( bania et al . 1986 ) , is the southern terminus part of the 135-kms@xmath13 arm which penetrates the far - side dustlane shock . according to model  l10t2540",
    ", its dynamics should be rather subtle : a part of its gas is absorbed by the dustlane , resulting in a huge velocity change like those described above , from @xmath227  kms@xmath13 to @xmath228 , and the other part , corresponding to the portion of clump  1 at @xmath229 , is gliding outwards along but without crossing the shock front until apocentre is reached ( see the magenta segment in fig .",
    "[ region ] ) .",
    "the momentum injected by this cloud into the axis shock gas bends the outer segment of the shock .",
    "since the far - side dustlane is nearly aligned with the line of sight , the vertical feature near @xmath218 is in fact a superposition of dustlane gas moving along this line and of clouds with shock induced velocity gradients ( see fig .",
    "[ path ] ) .",
    "clump  1 must be a very perturbed and compressed region , and hence a potential site of star formation a priori .",
    "an indicator of `` readiness '' for star formation is given by the @xmath8co @xmath52 to @xmath51 ratio , tracing dense molecular clouds , which is indeed particularly high for this clump ( hasegawa 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "however , the strong shearing in the shock may prevent any star formation to proceed ( e.g. reynaud & downes 1998 ) .",
    "the bulk of this clump , owing to its large mass and impact velocity , may also cross the shock front without being too much affected .",
    "a further observational argument supporting our interpretation of the dominant @xmath1 features is the fact that the connecting arm and the portion of the 3-kpc arm at positive longitude , located in the near - side of the bar according to the models , have their maximum emission below the galactic plane ( i.e. at @xmath230 ) , and that the dustlane near @xmath218 and the negative longitude part of the 135-kms@xmath13 arm , located in the far - side of the bar , above this plane ( i.e. @xmath231 ; see fig .",

    "( 1987 ; 1999 ) , where the dustlanes contribute only very little to the total emission .",

    "however , such a tilt has not been confirmed by the more recent cobe / dirbe maps ( weiland et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the dust subtracted k - band map ( paper i ) , the latitude centroid as a function of longitude , excluding the high extinction zone @xmath248 , only shows a significant tilt when",
    "regions beyond @xmath249 from the galactic plane are included , but then the tilt is likely an artifact due to the growing contribution of zodiacal light .",
    "the small tilt angle derived here is not generated by a position of the sun above the galactic plane , which is only of order @xmath250  pc ( humphreys & larsen 1995 and references therein ) , and concerns gas on a larger scale than the 180-pc molecular ring , for which an apparent tilt angle of @xmath251 has been estimated , also with negative latitude in the first galactic quadrant ( uchida et al .",
    "1994a ; morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "larger tilts of the inner @xmath252  kpc gaseous disc , of @xmath253 and based on expanding or elliptical motion models , have been reported in the past ( e.g. cohen 1975 ; burton & liszt 1978 ; liszt & burton 1980 ) .",
    "more recently , burton & liszt  ( 1992 ) have updated and improved their tilted disc model into a flaring warp with a central disc coplanar to the galactic plane .",
    "the warp is rectilinear in each radius and the tilt of its midplane is given by @xmath254 , where @xmath59 is the galactocentric azimuth relative to the sun defined positive in the direction of galactic rotation , @xmath255 the azimuth of the line of nodes and @xmath256 the maximum tilt angle .",

    "this part of the @xmath1 observations is probably the most complex and the most difficult to understand .",
    "binney et al .  (",
    "1991 ) have given a detailed description of the gas flow in a rotating barred potential in terms of the closed @xmath4 orbits , associating the terminal velocity curves in the observed @xmath1 diagrams with the envelope of non self - intersecting such orbits and the parallelogram structure of the 180-pc molecular ring with the innermost orbit of this kind , called the `` cusped @xmath4 '' orbit , where shocks would transform most of the atomic gas into molecules and force the gas to plunge onto the more viable orbits of the @xmath15 family .",
    "this model is confronted to several problems .",
    "the most frequently reported one ( e.g. kuijken 1996 ; morris & serabyn 1996 ) is the asymmetry of the observed 180-pc parallelogram , and in particular the substantial @xmath259  kms@xmath13 forbidden velocity near @xmath260 , which can not be fully accounted for by projection effects of the cusped @xmath4 orbit .",
    "other problems are : ( i ) when viewed in the full @xmath261 data cube , the 180-pc parallelogram appears more as an assemblage of larger scale features rather than forming a distinct unity ( see e.g. fig .  4 in morris & serabyn 1996 ) ; for instance , its upper edge is observed to extend continuously well beyond the longitude range of the postulated parallelogram and joins the connecting arm through the positive terminal velocity peak , ( ii )  the terminal velocity peaks and the parallelogram can not both be generated by the same cusped @xmath4 orbit because the formers occur well outside the longitude boundaries of the latter , ( iii ) the longitudinal edges of the parallelogram near @xmath262 and @xmath263 , assimilated to the bar leading shocks in the model , should define rather clear @xmath1 features as in our models , yet these edges are more disordered than the other edges of the parallelogram , and ( iv ) the cusped @xmath4 orbit of the stellar dynamical models in paper  i generally does not match the hi terminal velocity peaks ; the models providing the best agreement always arise in young and not completely stabilised bars , whereas in older bars the cusped @xmath4 orbit presents velocity peaks at fairly larger absolute longitudes than observed .",
    "figure  [ x1 ] shows that the dustlane shocks are indeed responsible for the positive and negative terminal velocity peaks , but that they do not coincide with the leading edges of the cusped @xmath4  orbit , which produces velocity peaks at higher absolute longitude and with lower velocity amplitude .",
    "gas on the shocks move along non - periodic orbits with much smaller pericentre than the cusped @xmath4  orbit .",
    "thus the milky  way s cusped @xmath4  orbit is probably much larger than in the binney et al .",
    "model , explaining why these authors find a very small corotation radius of @xmath244  kpc .",
    "the asymmetries in our models make the cusped @xmath4 orbit slightly uncertain . in particular",
    ", there is a small range of hamiltonians where the @xmath4 orbits only loop at one extremity .",
    "however , studies of galactic @xmath4 orbits generally represent the true milky  way s potential by bisymmetric models and therefore are also concerned with similar uncertainties .",
    "the gas on the dustlanes falling onto the nuclear ring from large distances does not necessarily merge with the ring , but rather passes round of it and lands on the opposite dustlane closer to the nuclear ring , merging with it only at the next passage or after repeating the whole cycle once more ( fig .",
    "[ path ] ; see also fig .",
    "10a in fukuda et al .",
    "the farther out the gas on the dustlanes originates , the more it passes away from the nuclear ring .",
    "the upper and lower edges of the 180-pc parallelogram could represent such gas streams which precisely brush the nuclear ring / disc , loosing only little mass to it .",
    "the mass transfer would appear in the @xmath1 plot like vertical bridges between the streams and the nuclear disc .",
    "an example of such bridges is detectable in the high resolution @xmath8co data ( e.g. morris & serabyn 1996 ) near @xmath264 and for @xmath265 between  @xmath31 and @xmath219  kms@xmath13 .",
    "the brushing streams finally crash in the dustlanes where they are abruptly decelerated .",
    "the right longitudinal edge of the 180-pc parallelogram , at @xmath266 , could be a trace of this process .",
    "however it is not very clear why this edge is located at lower absolute longitude than the bright emission near the negative terminal velocity peak , corresponding to gas with about maximum velocity on the far - side dustlane , i.e. why the gas on this dustlane slows down _ before _ being striked by the positive velocity stream round the nuclear ring .",
    "uchida et al .  ( 1994b ) have reported on a large scale shock front in the afgl  5376 region , which is close to the southern end of the parallelogram upper edge , but which they consider as a support of the expanding molecular ring hypothesis .",
    "figure  [ other ] shows how the @xmath1 diagram of model l10t2540 changes when the viewing point of the observer is modified . reducing the bar inclination angle",
    "@xmath267 shrinks the structures longitudinally and amplifies the velocities .",
    "the observed knee of the 135-km@xmath268 arm near @xmath269 is better reproduced , but the transition of the 3-kpc arm to the connecting arm happens at too negative velocity and the connecting arm becomes too steep .",
    "increasing the angle @xmath267 lowers the forbidden velocities , moves the terminal velocity peaks further away from @xmath16 and shifts the connecting arm closer to the northern tangent points of the two molecular ring branches . increasing",

    "the diagram with the observer at @xmath270 moves the loop associated to the @xmath271 prolongation of the molecular ring structure out to the real tangent point of the carina arm near @xmath272 .",
    "these properties can not be used to infer a robust inclination angle of the bar because they are based on one specific model and the gas flow is strongly time - dependent .",
    "constraining the bar parameters by adjusting gas dynamical models to the observed co and hi @xmath1 diagrams is a very delicate task and may lead to unreliable results if the models are not sufficiently realistic .",
    "however , with our interpretation of the dominant features in these diagrams , it is possible to provide geometrical constraints on the bar inclination angle and extension which do not depend on the details of the models .",
    "the principle of the method , illustrated in fig .",

    "the resulting constraints are put together in fig .",
    "clearly , the distance @xmath277 increases for smaller values of @xmath267 , but no precise value can be given so far for the inclination angle .",

    "it remains to see how the arm intersections discussed here are related to the true bar parameters .",
    "numerical simulations and analyses of observations in early - type barred galaxies indicate that the ratio between the bar semi - major axis and the corotation radius amounts to @xmath289 , and offset dustlanes in such galaxies do not extend beyond the bar ends , i.e. @xmath290 ( e.g. the review of elmegreen 1996 ) . also ,",

    "our value of @xmath277 would imply a corotation radius of @xmath293  kpc for the milky  way .",
    "the situation in our non - symmetrised and time - dependent simulations , shown in fig .",
    "[ lateral ] , is much more complicated however . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ gas ] , the radius of the intersections between the lateral arms and the axis shocks increases with time . at the formation of a lateral arm , the associated intersection leads the bar major axis , and as the arm moves outwards , it crosses this axis and becomes trailing .",
    "when both are exactly in phase , the intersection radius relative to corotation is @xmath294 on the average , compatible with the value adopted above , and compares very well to the apocentre radius of the cusped @xmath4 orbit ( see fig .",
    "further out , the lateral arms rapidly dissolve in the spiral arms emanating from the very end of the axis shocks .",
    "the minimum value of the ratio @xmath295 , which could depend on the size of the nuclear ring in the models , is about @xmath296 . taking this value as a lower limit for the 135-kms@xmath13 arm leads to @xmath297 for the 3-kpc arm , suggesting that this arm should meet the connecting arm close to the bar major axis and close to the apocentre of the cusped @xmath4 orbit",
    "this is also confirmed by the fact that there is no obvious velocity gap in the observed @xmath1 diagrams at the longitude where the 3-kpc arm passes into the connecting arm .",
    "our models suggest that the tangent points of the two molecular ring branches in the first galactic quadrant are within corotation ( see fig .",
    "[ x1 ] ) , contrary to englmaier & gerhard s  ( 1999 ) deduction , and therefore we rather advocate @xmath298  kpc .",
    "our value for the bar inclination angle agrees very well with many other determinations ( e.g. stanek et al .",
    "1997 ; nikolaev & weinberg 1997 ) , and in particular with the recent result @xmath299 of englmaier & gerhard  ( 1999 ) , who derived the gas flow in the potential of the deprojected cobe / dirbe luminosity distribution ( binney et al .",
    "the bisymmetric hydro simulations done by weiner & sellwood  ( 1999 ) and matched to the observed hi terminal velocity curves favour slightly larger values of this angle , i.e. @xmath300 , and support a corotation radius between @xmath38 and @xmath301  kpc ( for @xmath302  kpc ) .",
    "these authors consider an angle below @xmath208 unlikely , but it should be noted that gas flow fluctuations like those in our self - consistent simulations can increase the @xmath1 area covered by forbidden velocities and hence substantially bias their method .",
    "it is also possible from our data interpretation to give a crude estimate of the bar pattern speed .",
    "if the 3-kpc arm indeed encounters the connecting arm near the apocentre of the cusped @xmath4  orbit , then the gas at the intersection of the two arms should corotate with the bar figure .",
    "evaluating the radial velocity  @xmath303 of this gas relative to the lsr yields its rotation velocity with respect to the galactic centre : @xmath304 and resorting to eq .  ( 26 ) : @xmath305 where @xmath306 is the circular velocity of the lsr and @xmath307 .",
    "the bar inclination angle and @xmath277 have vanished in this last formula and thus the method is independent of them .",
    "the value of @xmath303 is hard to determine in the co and hi @xmath1 plots because of overlayed emission from the disc and in particular from the molecular ring , but a reasonable range is @xmath308  kms@xmath13 . with @xmath22  kpc , @xmath309  kms@xmath13 and @xmath310 as before , one gets @xmath311",
    "kms@xmath13kpc@xmath13 , in fair agreement with the @xmath19  kms@xmath13kpc@xmath13 of our gas simulations(fig .",
    "[ omp ] ) when rescaled to @xmath312  kpc .",
    "changing the value of @xmath273 or @xmath306 by @xmath313 and @xmath214  kms@xmath13 modifies the result only by @xmath252% and @xmath167% respectively .",
    "however , @xmath303 may be affected by a radial motion of the lsr and/or oscillations of the bar density centre .",
    "longitude - velocity maps of very dense gas ( like cs ) could help to localise more precisely the transition from the 3-kpc arm to the connecting arm .",
    "note that the method does not apply to the very asymmetric model l10t2540 , as can be checked from fig .",
    "[ other ] , because the gas at the transition is not at rest in the frame of the bar .",
    "this paper presents the first fully self - consistent gas flow models of the inner milky  way , obtained by incorporating an sph component with @xmath314 particles in realistic symmetry - free barred 3d @xmath0-body simulations with nearly @xmath315 total number of particles .",
    "the axisymmetric initial conditions of the simulations are chosen to evolve spontaneously in a barred configuration compatible with the cobe / dirbe k - band constraints , according to criteria based on a set of lower resolution pure stellar dynamical simulations realised in a precedent paper .",
    "the stellar bar rotates with its intrinsic natural pattern speed and the gas component , gently released from its axisymmetric configuration after the formation of the bar , freely interacts with the live stellar arms .",
    "the density centre of the stellar bar becomes unstable and oscillates around the centre of mass with an amplitude of several @xmath31  pc and a frequency of @xmath316  kms@xmath13kpc@xmath13 .",
    "the gas flow , contrary to other bisymmetric hydro simulations in fixed rotating barred potentials , never reaches a quasi - steady state and can delineate strong asymmetries in its spiral structure , not necessarily induced by the lopsided stellar distribution .",
    "some models selected from the simulations account for many features seen in the hi and co longitude - velocity distributions within the galactic bar and surrounding regions , and provide a very powerful guide to understand the inner structure of the milky  way .",
    "the galactic bar is inclined by @xmath5 relative to the @xmath16 line , has a corotation radius of @xmath6  kpc , a related pattern speed @xmath317  kms@xmath13kpc@xmath13 , and a face - on axis ratio @xmath7 . as in most early - type barred spirals ,",
    "offset dustlanes are leading the bar major axis .",
    "their gaseous traces in the observed @xmath1 diagrams correspond to the connecting arm ( near - side branch ) and another feature near @xmath218 ( far - side branch ) .",
    "these dustlanes are the loci of strong shearing shocks with velocity changes up to @xmath219  kms@xmath13 across , and are located closer to the bar major axis than the leading edges of the cusped @xmath4 orbit .",
    "the peaks in the terminal velocity curves at @xmath318 are produced by the post - shock gas and not by the @xmath1 trace of the latter orbit , which has velocity peaks at larger absolute longitude and with lower velocity amplitude .",
    "the near - side branch of the dustlanes lies below the galactic plane ( @xmath230 ) and the other branch , which is seen almost end - on , above it .",
    "their maximum departure fromthe plane amounts to more than @xmath31  pc .",
    "the 3-kpc and 135-kms@xmath13 arms are the inner prolongations of spiral arms in the disc , each passing close to one bar end and joining by a large bow around the nuclear ring / disc the dustlane in the other side of the bar , at galactocentric distances @xmath319  kpc and @xmath320  kpc respectively . the 135-kms@xmath13 arm is associated with larger forbidden velocities because of its deeper location in the central potential well .",
    "velocity - elongated features in the observed co @xmath1 diagrams `` below '' the connecting arm , i.e. at similar longitudes but lower velocities than this arm , are interpreted as gas lumps which are just about to cross the shock front layer of the near - side dustlane .",
    "a robust example of such a feature is given by the vertical feature near @xmath222 .",
    "clump  2 complex is a more controversial candidate because its mean galactic latitude differs by roughly half a degree from that of the connecting arm at same longitude and because of its substantial mass . finally , bania s clump  1 complex is the part of the 135-kms@xmath13 arm which strikes the far - side dustlane with a considerable incident velocity of order @xmath31  kms@xmath13 .",
    "a fraction of its gas is directly absorbed by the dustlane , producing the apparent positive velocity trace of the dustlane , another fraction is gliding outwards along the dustlane , but the bulk of the clump is probably not intercepted by the dustlane .",
    "the interpretation of the main observed @xmath1 features given in this paper are by far the most plausible that can be deduced from our simulations .",
    "however , these simulations may still significantly depart from reality and hence the unicity of our interpretation can not be guaranteed .",
    "for instance , if a large amount of gas is concentrated in the centre , a nuclear fast rotating bar may temporarily form and lead to a different understanding of the very complex innermost gas dynamics .",
    "i would like to thank l.  martinet , d.  pfenniger and d.  friedli for many advices and careful reading of the manuscript , d.  friedli for making its original hybrid @xmath0-body and sph code available , and f.  combes ( referee of this paper ) , j.  sellwood , o.  gerhard and p.  englmaier for several enlightening discussions .",
