    "observationally , helium and heavier element atmospheres have been proposed for interpreting the spectral features observed in several ins partially because the existing hydrogen atmosphere models do not reproduce the observed spectra @xcite",
    ". however , atomic and molecular data in the strong magnetic field regime are scarce for non - hydrogenic elements .",

    "helium molecular binding energies have been crudely calculated by density functional theory @xcite ( hereafter ml06 ) .",
    "unlike hydrogen atmospheres @xcite , the ionization and dissociation balance in strongly - magnetized helium atmosphere has not been investigated yet .    in this paper , we extend our hartree - fock type calculation @xcite to helium molecules in the born - oppenheimer approximation . for molecular ions that exist in strong magnetic fields ( @xmath6@xmath1 g ) , we achieved @xmath91% and @xmath910% agreement in binding energies and vibrational energies in comparison with other more accurate studies mainly on hydrogen molecules . including numerous electronic , vibrational and rotational states , we studied ionization and dissociation equilibrium in helium atmospheres at @xmath6@xmath1 g. we also applied our calculations to several inss which may have helium atmospheres on their surfaces .",
    "at first we adopt the born - oppenheimer approximation and neglected any effects associated with motion of atoms and molecules in a magnetic field .",
    "later , we will discuss rotovibrational states (  [ sec_rovib ] ) and how the finite nuclear mass modifies results (  [ sec_finite_mass ] ) . in the landau regime ( @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the atomic number ) , bound electrons in an atom and molecule are well specified by two quantum numbers @xmath13 .",

    "we consider only tightly - bound states with @xmath16 .",
    "electronic excited states with @xmath17 have small binding energies , therefore their population in the atmosphere is tiny due to small boltzmann factors and pressure ionization .",

    "the calculated binding energy values are not smooth near the energy minimum ( figure [ fig_he2_energy ] ) .",
    "this is due to our numerical errors .",

    "[ sec_nuc_mass ] , our scheme using the zero pseudomomentum becomes invalid at @xmath107 and in reality he@xmath28 will have lower binding energy than he@xmath52 .",

    "when motional stark effects are ignored ( dotted line ) , the molecular fraction is underestimated because helium ions and atoms are subject to a larger motional stark field due to their smaller masses and binding energies .",
    "as expected , molecules become more abundant when rotovibrational states are included .",
    "the discrepancy from the results without rotovibrational states ( dashed line ) increases toward higher temperature since more rotovibrational states have larger statistical weight as their excitation energies are an order of 100 ev at @xmath115 g ( see figure [ fig_he2_rovib ] ) .",
    "when we take into account only the ground states ( dot - dashed line ) , the results are close to the case without motional stark effects because the ground states are less affected by motional stark effects than the excited states .",
    "when he@xmath28 is abundant , larger helium molecules such as he@xmath116 may become abundant .",
    "we roughly estimated the fraction of he@xmath116 molecules by neglecting the finite nuclear mass effects and zero - point vibrational energy correction both of which will reduce the dissociation energy . similarly to he@xmath28 , we computed the binding energy of he@xmath116 molecules by hartree - fock calculation .",

    "figure  [ fig_he3 ] shows contours of the he@xmath116 molecule fraction with respect to he@xmath28 molecule at @xmath115 g. in the dotted area , the fraction of diatomic helium molecular ions is larger than 10% .",

    "we investigated the ionization and dissociation balance of helium atmospheres for two classes of ins whose x - ray spectra show absorption features .",
    "a class of ins called radio - quiet neutron stars ( rqns ) is characterized by their x - ray thermal spectra with @xmath128 k and spin - down dipole b - field strength @xmath120 g. a single or multiple absorption features have been detected from six radio - quiet ns @xcite . although the interpretation of these features is still in debate , helium is certainly one of the candidates for the surface composition of rqns @xcite .",
    "timing analysis suggests that a couple of rqns have dipole magnetic field strengths in the range of @xmath115@xmath1  g @xcite .",
    "therefore , we investigated the ionization / dissociation balance of a helium atmosphere at @xmath129 g. figure  [ fig_he30 ] shows the contours of he@xmath3 and he molecular fractions at @xmath130 g. he@xmath3 is dominant at @xmath131 k and molecules become largely populated at @xmath132 k.    suppose all the rqns have helium atmospheres on the surface .",
    "rqns with higher temperatures ( @xmath131 k ) such as rxj0720.4 - 3125 and rxj1605.3 + 3249 will have he@xmath3 ions predominantly with a small fraction of he atoms .",
    "indeed , several bound - bound transition lines of he@xmath3 ion have energies at the observed absorption line location at @xmath120 g @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , rqns with lower temperatures ( @xmath133 k ) such as rxj0420.0 - 5022 may have some fraction of helium molecules , although the he@xmath3 ion is still predominant at low densities where absorption lines are likely formed .",
    "1e1207.4 - 5209 is a hot isolated ns with age @xmath134  yrs .",
    "the fitted blackbody temperature is @xmath135  k @xcite .",
    "presence of a non - hydrogenic atmosphere has been suggested since 1e1207 shows multiple absorption features at higher energies than hydrogen atmosphere models predicted @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpreted the observed features as bound - bound transition lines of a he@xmath3 ion at @xmath136 g. also , @xcite suggested that he@xmath54 molecular ion may be responsible for one of the absorption features observed in 1e1207 at @xmath137 g.    however , our study shows that the fraction of he@xmath54 molecular ions is negligible at any b - field and temperature because more neutral molecular ions have significantly larger binding energies .",
    "we also investigated ionization / dissociation balance of helium atmospheres at @xmath138 g ( figure [ fig_he200 ] ) . at @xmath139 , our scheme of treating finite nuclear mass effects",
    "becomes progressively inaccurate . as a result ,",
    "the ionization energy of helium atoms becomes significantly smaller and the he@xmath28 molecule becomes auto - ionized due to the finite nuclear mass correction discussed in  [ sec_nuc_mass ] .",
    "therefore , the molecular fraction will be underestimated in this case ( the left panel in figure [ fig_he200 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when we ignore the finite nuclear mass effects ( the right panel in figure [ fig_he200 ] ) , the molecular fraction is likely overestimated .",
    "we expect that a realistic ionic and molecular fraction will be somewhere between the two cases .",
    "it is premature to conclude whether he@xmath3 is dominant for the case of 1e1207 since we do not have a self - consistent temperature and density profile .",
    "the study of ml06 and @xcite also suggests the critical temperature below which helium molecule chains form is @xmath135 k at @xmath136 g. this is close to the blackbody temperature of 1e1207 .",
    "further detailed studies are necessary to conclude the composition of helium atmospheres at @xmath136 g.",
    "we have examined the ionization - dissociation balance of the helium atmospheres of strongly magnetized neutron stars . as the observational data on isolated neutron stars has improved over the past decade @xcite ,",
    "both hydrogen and iron atmospheres have lost favour , and atmospheres composed of other elements have been invoked to interpret both the continuum and spectral properties of neutron stars . on the other hand",
    "the theoretical investigations of @xcite and @xcite have shown that diffusive nuclear burning may quickly deplete the hydrogen by so the ns surface may be composed of helium or heavier elements .",
    "the results found here indicate several avenues for future work .",
    "although the treatment of finite nuclear mass effects is problematic in the strong field limit , only by including this accurately can we know the physical state of matter in super - critical magnetic fields  solid , liquid or gas .",
    "the state can have significant effects of the outgoing radiation from these objects .",
    "it is also important to repeat a similar calculation to that presented here for molecular chains , including all of the relevant degrees of freedom of the chains , _",
    "i.e. _ including the bending modes which were neglected here .",
    "regardless , the high abundance of molecules under the conditions of observed neutron star atmospheres is bound to spur additional research into the statistical mechanics of highly magnetized molecules and polymers .    at the temperatures and densities of neutron star atmospheres the rotovibrational excitations of helium molecules",
    "are populated .",
    "including these excitations increases the expected abundance of molecules by up to two orders of magnitude relative to calculations that ignore the internal states of the molecule .",
    "ionization , dissociation and electric excitation energies of helium molecules are larger than 100 ev at @xmath5 g. on the other hand , rotovibrational excitation energies are in the range of 10100 ev at @xmath6@xmath1 g. if helium molecules are abundannt , their spectroscopic signatures may be detected in the optical , uv and x - ray band .",
