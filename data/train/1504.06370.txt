    "during the last few years , there has been significant progress  @xcite towards the realization of quantum computing architectures based on shallow donors in silicon ( si )  @xcite .",
    "several techniques have been explored to implement precise control of the nuclear or electronic spins through wave function engineering of donors using either electric fields  @xcite or strain fields  @xcite . at the core of such approaches , controlled",
    "manipulation of the donor hyperfine coupling is a critical component .",
    "previous theoretical studies have been primarily focused on the electric - field - dependent stark shift of the hyperfine interaction  @xcite for donors in si , which is now well understood from both theory  @xcite and experiments  @xcite . in comparison , the strain - dependence of the hyperfine coupling is relatively less studied , despite offering a promising alternative to manipulate the hyperfine coupling of donors .",
    "the presence of strain , in contrast to the use of an electric field , eliminates the possibility of ionization , as the control of the donor wave function is mechanical rather than electrostatic .",
    "additionally strain can drastically reduce valley oscillations of exchange coupling  @xcite , which would play an important role in field control of qubits in strained environments .",
    "recent progress towards atomically precise fabrication of donors in strained si provides a testbed to demonstrate the advantages of strain in the realization of donor - based qubit devices  @xcite .",
    "whilst the previous studies have exclusively considered strain or electric field effects on the quantum control of the donors , it is clear that through valley physics there is a subtle interplay between these two effects .",
    "this work establishes a multi - scale theoretical approach to provide an understanding of the impact of strain and electric fields simultaneously present in the qubit devices , and predicts that such a hybrid quantum control scheme can open new avenues for architectures with faster single spin gates and spin - dependent tunneling read - out strategies .",
    "existing theoretical studies of the impact of strain on the hyperfine interaction of donors have been based on either valley - repopulation model ( vrm ) derived from effective - mass theory ( emt )  @xcite or density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "while the vrm model was useful in providing a first - order description of the hyperfine shifts for small strain fields , it failed to explain the experimentally measured hyperfine reduction at large strain fields  @xcite .",
    "the dft calculations for strained si : p exhibited good agreement with the experimental measurements for an extended range of strain fields  @xcite , highlighting the importance of atomistic approaches .",
    "however , this method is limited to only few - atom systems , and is consequently unable to reproduce the donor binding energy spectra and provide a detailed picture of the wave functions  @xcite .",
    "therefore the requirement for a theoretical framework with an atomistic accuracy accompanied by scalability to large - scale realistic systems remains a critical challenging problem .",
    "our work fills this theory gap by establishing a multi - scale atomistic tight - binding framework , which in contrast to other approaches  @xcite explicitly includes central - cell corrections and non - static dielectric screening of the donor potential .",
    "the multi - million - atom simulations for strain - dependent hyperfine interaction are benchmarked to a high level against both ab - initio approaches and experiment .",
    "the electric field dependence of the hyperfine is accurately captured by demonstrating excellent agreement with the experimentally measured stark shift data  @xcite for all of the four donor species considered ( p , as , sb , and bi ) . a clear understanding of the influence of strain on the physical properties of the donor is presented in terms of underlying valley physics .",
    "the performance prospects of unstrained and strained si substrates are explored , uncovering the benefits of strain for qubit devices , in particular by showing that a hybrid control of qubits based on ( 001 ) compressive strain and in - plane fields ( 100 or 010 ) results in higher gate fidelities and/or faster gate operations for all of the four donor species . due to recent research interests for",
    "as , sb , and bi donors  @xcite , we also present a comparison among different donor species in strained si environments , further highlighting the trends of strain and electric field induced shifts in the hyperfine couplings , and providing predictions at large strain fields where no previous experimental or theoretical data exists .",
    "a novel scheme of two - dimensional hyperfine control in strained environments is explored based on electric fields from top and side gates .",
    "whilst faster gate operations are realisable with the in - plane fields for p , as , and sb donors , only for the bi donor , faster gate response is predicted in the presence of both in - plane ( 100 or 010 ) and out - of - plane ( 001 ) fields , truly benefiting from the proposed planar field control mechanism of hyperfine control .",
    "in our tb approach , the si bulk band structure is reproduced using a twenty - orbital ( sp@xmath0d@xmath1s@xmath2 ) basis  @xcite .",
    "the donor atom is placed at the center of a large si box ( 40@xmath340@xmath340 nm@xmath0 ) consisting of roughly 3.1 million atoms , and is represented by a coulomb potential , u(r ) , which is screened by non - static dielectric function for si and is given by :    @xmath4     + where @xmath5 is the electronic charge , and the previously published values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are taken from the literature  @xcite .",
    "recently we have demonstrated the importance of the central - cell corrections and the non - static dielectric screening of the donor potential to accurately reproduce the experimental stark shift for the si : as donors  @xcite .",
    "we now show that the non - static dielectric screening is also crucial to accurately reproduce the experimentally measured strained hyperfine interaction at large strain fields .",
    "therefore this work extends the tb model using the non - static screening function to p , sb , and bi donors .",
    "the donor potential is truncated to u@xmath11 at the donor site , @xmath12=0 .",
    "the values of u@xmath11 are adjusted to reproduce the experimentally measured binding energy spectra of the donors  @xcite . by using the u@xmath11 values of 3.5 ev , 2.2 ev , 3.8365 ev , and 4.6668 ev for p , as , sb ,",
    "and bi donors respectively , we calculate the binding energies of the ground states a@xmath13 within 1 @xmath14ev and the binding energies of the excited states ( t@xmath15 and e ) within 1 mev of the experimental values for all of the four donor species .",
    "it should be emphasized that whereas multi - valley emt theories have been successful in fitting the ground state binding energies  @xcite , the fitting of all of the three 1s states simultaneously with such a level of accuracy has been inaccessible .",
    "the accurate fitting of the excited state energies , as achieved in this work , is critically important for strain - dependent hyperfine studies , where the excited state e mixes with the ground state a@xmath13 as a function of the strain .",
    "for the study of the strain - dependent hyperfine interaction of donors , we first benchmark our model against the recent experimental data set for the p donors  @xcite .",
    "a commonly adopted procedure to induce strain is by using the lattice mismatch technique , where two materials with different lattice constants are grown on top of each other .",
    "such a technique is depicted in figure  [ fig : fig1](a ) , where p doped si is shown on top of a si@xmath16ge@xmath17 virtual substrate .",
    "the amount of strain in the si region can be tuned by varying the ge fraction ( @xmath18 ) in the substrate .",
    "the lattice constant of si@xmath16ge@xmath17 is larger than si , and therefore induces a tensile strain in p - doped si region along the in - plane directions ( a@xmath19 a@xmath20 ) .",
    "consequently , the out - of - plane lattice constant ( a@xmath21 ) shrinks in accordance with the poisson s ratio , leading to a compressive strain along the growth direction ( a@xmath22 a@xmath20 ) . for a ( 001)-oriented si@xmath16ge@xmath17/si system ,",
    "the growth axis is the z - axis and the growth plane is the xy - plane , implying that the z - valleys ( xy valleys ) will primarily experience the effect of a compressive ( tensile ) strain . +",
    "* 3.1 characterising strain effects through valley physics : * + figure  [ fig : fig1](b ) schematically illustrates different effects on the splittings of 1s donor states . the valley configuration of the lowest energy ground state is also included .",
    "a simple effective mass theory without multi - valley effects , such as presented by kohn - luttinger  @xcite , would lead to a six - fold degenerate 1s state as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1](b1 ) . in reality , the effect of valley - orbit interactions results in a splitting of the 1s energies into three sets ( figure  [ fig : fig1](b2 ) ) . the lowest ground state a@xmath13 is a singlet state , which is made up of all six valleys with a configuration of @xmath23\\{1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1}. the first triply - degenerate excited state ( t@xmath15 ) has the following valley configurations : t@xmath24=@xmath25\\{1 , -1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 } , t@xmath26=@xmath25\\{0 , 0 , 1 , -1 , 0 , 0 } , and t@xmath27=@xmath25\\{0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , -1}. the second doubly - degenerate excited states ( e ) are composed of the following valley configurations : e@xmath28=@xmath29\\{1 , 1 , -1 , -1 , 0 , 0 } and e@xmath30=@xmath31\\{-1 , -1 , -1 , -1 , 2 , 2}. the influence of strain on the donor energies can be understood in terms of their valley configurations : the valleys in the direction of compressive strain experience a reduction in energy ( higher population ) and that valleys in the direction of tensile strain exhibit an increased energy ( lower population )  @xcite .",
    "since the excited states consist of assymetric valley contributions , they experience different effects of strain and therefore do not remain degenerate in the presence of strain ( figure  [ fig : fig1](b3 ) ) . in our case",
    ", the tensile strain along the x and y directions will push the states with xy - valley configurations ( t@xmath24 , t@xmath26 , e@xmath28 ) up and the compressive strain along the z - axis will shift the states with z - valley configurations ( a@xmath32 and t@xmath27 ) downward on the energy scale .",
    "the valley repopluation effect for a@xmath32 has also been shown by illustrated by showing z - valleys ( indicated by the red color ) larger in size when compared with the xy valleys ( indicated by the green color ) . in the schemetic diagram of figure  [ fig : fig1](b3 ) .",
    "the impact of strain on the donor states can be characterized either directly in terms of the ge fraction @xmath18 in the substrate , or can be described in terms of a dimensionless parameter so called the valley strain , @xmath33 , which was derived by wilson and feher  @xcite , and is given by :    @xmath34    here the value of the uniaxial strain parameter @xmath35 is 8.6 ev , c@xmath36 and c@xmath37 are the elastic constants of si and the value of their ratio c@xmath37/c@xmath36 is 2.6 , 6@xmath38=12.96 ev is the energy splitting of the singlet ( a@xmath13 ) and doublet ( e ) states for the unstrained bulk p donor , a@xmath39=0.5431 nm and a@xmath40=0.5658 nm are the bulk si and ge lattice constants respectively , and @xmath18 is the concentration of ge in the virtual si@xmath16ge@xmath17 substrate . for this study , we vary @xmath18 between 0 and 0.5 , which corresponds to a variation of @xmath33 from 0 to @xmath4149 . for each value of @xmath18",
    ", a strained tb hamiltonian  @xcite is solved to compute the strained donor energies and states .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1](c1 ) plots the p donor energies calculated from tb simulations for a large variation of the valley strain @xmath33 .",
    "the valley repopulation effect primarily occurs for small magnitudes of @xmath33 , so figure  [ fig : fig1](c2 ) presents zoomed - in version of the plot for @xmath424 @xmath43 0 to highlight this effect .",
    "the effect of applied strain is on donor energies is accurately captured by the tb theory , indicating a partial lift of the degeneracy of the t@xmath15 states , splitting them into a single t@xmath27 state whose energy decreases due to compressive strain along the z - axis , and a pair of degenerate t@xmath24 and t@xmath26 states with their energies increasing due to the effect of tensile strain .",
    "the t@xmath24 and t@xmath26 states remain degenerate as the same magnitude of strain is applied along the x and y - axis ( a@xmath17=a@xmath44=a@xmath45 ) .",
    "the strain completely lifts the degeneracy of the e states . the energy of the e@xmath28 state increases due to the effect of tensile strain .",
    "the remaining two states a@xmath13 and e@xmath30 with contributions from all of the six valleys experience the effect of both compressive strain along the z - axis and the tensile strain along the x and y - axis , and therefore exhibit a nonlinear dependence on @xmath33 .",
    "the strain mixes the e@xmath30 excited state into the ground a@xmath13 state . for @xmath424",
    "@xmath43 0 , the a@xmath13 state experiences the competing effects of the tensile and compressive strains . initially",
    "the increase in @xmath46 is larger than the decrease in a@xmath21 , so the energy of the a@xmath13 state slightly increases .",
    "however , at the same time strain depopulates x and y valleys and increases z - valley contribution .",
    "this reverses the change in a@xmath13 due to the effect of decrease in a@xmath21 being increasingly dominant on the increasingly z - valley like a@xmath13 state . for @xmath475 ,",
    "the lowest energy state is dominantly a z - valley state , with mixing from the e@xmath30 state to form a new ground state a@xmath32 . the e@xmath30 state is primarily composed of x and y valleys , and therefore its energy increases with strain .",
    "it is noted that the t@xmath27 state does not mix with the a@xmath32 state as it is composed of two z - valleys with opposite signs .",

    "this implies a reduction in the ionization fields for the strained p donors , which would be useful for recently proposed spin - dependent tunneling read - out schemes  @xcite .",

    "+ * 3.2 hyperfine control by strain : * + the hyperfine interaction a(0 ) is directly related to the charge density at the donor site , @xmath53(0)@xmath54 .",
    "only the a@xmath13 state has a non - zero charge density at the donor site , thus only this state contributes in the determination of a(0 ) .",
    "the excited states t@xmath15 and e do not contribute to a(0 ) .",
    "the applied strain reduces the hyperfine coupling due to the following reasons : ( 1 ) _ valley repopulation effect : _ strain removes contributions from the x and y valleys , and increases z - valley contribution of the a@xmath13 state due to mixing of the e@xmath30 state .",
    "the e@xmath30 state does not contribute in a(0 ) , so a(@xmath33 ) becomes less than a(0 ) .",
    "( 2 ) _ crystal deformation : _ strain deforms the crystal and changes the bond - lengths from their bulk unstrained values .",
    "this modifies the radial distribution of the donor states , which are scattered over several si lattice sites around the donor atom , leading to a reduction in hyperfine .",
    "the vrm model based on the emt theory only considers the first effect and the reduction in a(@xmath33 ) is represented by an analytical expression derived in ref .",
    "@xcite :    @xmath55\\ ] ]    based on this model , the fractional change in the hyperfine a(@xmath33)/a(0 ) as a function of @xmath33 is plotted in figure  [ fig : fig1](d ) using a dashed green line , along with the experimentally measured values ( red dots ) from ref .",
    "although the vrm method successfully describes a(@xmath33)/a(0 ) for small values of strain , it fails to capture the strain effects for the larger values of the applied strain ( @xmath4710 ) .",
    "in fact the vrm model limits the value of a(@xmath33)/a(0 ) to 1/3 for @xmath4720 , based on the fact that all of the six valleys have equal contributions to the a@xmath13 state , whereas only two z - valleys contribute to the a@xmath32 state and hence a(@xmath33)/a(0)=2/6 .",
    "adding radial redistribution effects in the vrm model only reduces a(@xmath33)/a(0 ) to 0.3 for @xmath33=@xmath4289  @xcite , still considerably different from the experimental data shown in figure  [ fig : fig1](d ) , indicating a(@xmath33)/a(0 ) already reduced to @xmath56 0.22@xmath570.09 at @xmath5829.5 . therefore in order to fully understand the strain dependence of the hyperfine , a more complete theoretical approach is required which takes into account both the valley - repopulation effect , as well as the volume deformation effect at atomistic scale .",
    "recently reported dft simulations  @xcite confirmed this notion by exhibiting a good match with the experimental data for both small and large values of strain ( diamonds in figure  [ fig : fig1](d ) ) .",
    "our tb calculations of a(@xmath33)/a(0 ) as a function of @xmath33 are shown in the figure  [ fig : fig1](d ) using the square symbols , which demonstrate an excellent agreement with the experimental data as well as with the dft calculations .",
    "for example , at @xmath5829.5 , we calculate a(@xmath33)/a(0 ) as @xmath560.284 , compared to the experimental value of @xmath560.22@xmath570.09 and the dft value of @xmath560.27 .",
    "it is noted that the previously applied static dielectric screening of the donor potential in the tb approach  @xcite results in a significantly higher value of @xmath560.364 for a(@xmath33)/a(0 ) , which emphasizes on the requirement of the non - static ( @xmath59-dependent ) screening of the donor potential for the study of the strain effects .",
    "the successful benchmarking of the tb method is in particular useful , because this approach has many advantages over the continuum emt model and the computationally restricted dft method .",
    "the tb theory not only accurately captures the atomistic physics , it is also scalable to simulation domains with millions of atoms , thereby enabling investigation of multi - qubit architectures .",
    "+ * 3.3 tight - binding predictions for as , sb , and bi donors : * + after benchmarking the tb theory against the experimental data set for the si : p system , we apply it to predict the influence of strain for other three donors ( as , sb , bi ) , which have drawn significant recent research interests  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2](a ) plots the energies of the lowest donor state as a function of the ge concentration @xmath18 in the si@xmath16ge@xmath17 substrate , which is a more relevant parameter for experimentalists compared to @xmath33 mainly used in analytical theories .",

    "again the overall trends are same for all the donors : in the valley - repopulation regime , the strain - dependent hyperfine decreases sharply but for larger strain values , it becomes much less dependent on the applied strain .",
    "interestingly , for a given value of @xmath18 , the order of @xmath50a(@xmath18)=a(@xmath18)/a(0 ) follows the same trend as the stark shift parameter @xmath60 : @xmath50a@xmath61(@xmath18 ) @xmath62a@xmath63(@xmath18 ) @xmath62a@xmath64(@xmath18 ) @xmath62a@xmath65(@xmath18 ) which is same order as @xmath66 .",

    "* 3.4 benchmarking stark shifts of hyperfine couplings against experiments : * + we have hitherto discussed the strain effects on the hyperfine interactions of donors , which will be useful for the psoposed all - mechanical control of qubits  @xcite . however , an alternative quantum computing architecture scheme could be based on a hybrid control of qubits , where the donors are present in strained si and the control is applied by electric fields .",
    "such hybrid control mechanism has certain benefits over traditional unstrained si based systems , as the applied strain is expected to reduce valley oscillations of exchange coupling  @xcite , as well as ionization fields . to study the effects of strain and electic fields simultaneously",
    "present in the qubit devices , we first calculate and benchmark the stark shift of the hyperfine interactions for all the four donor species under study . the stark shift is calculated by adding a potential corresponding to an electric field of magnitude varying from 0 and 0.5 mv / m in the diagonal elements of the tb hamiltonian , and computing the hyperfine interaction a(@xmath72 ) from the field - dependent ground state a@xmath13 . the change in the hyperfine relative to the absolute value of the hyperfine",

    "the increase in @xmath77(@xmath18)@xmath78 is larger for @xmath76 compared to @xmath75 for the same @xmath18 .",

    "<S> control of hyperfine interactions is a fundamental requirement for quantum computing architecture schemes based on shallow donors in silicon . </S>",
    "<S> however , at present , there is lacking an atomistic approach including critical effects of central - cell corrections and non - static screening of the donor potential capable of describing the hyperfine interaction in the presence of both strain and electric fields in realistically sized devices . </S>",
    "<S> we establish and apply a theoretical framework , based on atomistic tight - binding theory , to quantitatively determine the strain and electric field dependent hyperfine couplings of donors . </S>",
    "<S> our method is scalable to millions of atoms , and yet captures the strain effects with an accuracy level of dft method . </S>",
    "<S> excellent agreement with the available experimental data sets allow reliable investigation of the design space of multi - qubit architectures , based on both strain - only as well as hybrid ( strain+field ) control of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the benefits of strain are uncovered by demonstrating that a hybrid control of qubits based on ( 001 ) compressive strain and in - plane ( 100 or 010 ) fields results in higher gate fidelities and/or faster gate operations , for all of the four donor species considered ( p , as , sb , and bi ) . the comparison between different donor species in strained environments further highlights the trends of hyperfine shifts , providing predictions where no experimental data exists . </S>",
    "<S> whilst faster gate operations are realisable with in - plane fields for p , as , and sb donors , only for the bi donor , our calculations predict faster gate response in the presence of both in - plane and out - of - plane fields , truly benefiting from the proposed planar field control mechanism of the hyperfine interactions . </S>"
