    "the accelerating expansion of the universe was detected with the help of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the correlation between their decline rate and peak brightness @xcite , the corrected luminosities of sne ia exhibit sufficiently small dispersons that they can be used to measure cosmological distances and constrain cosmological parameters .    while sne ia are exquisite standard candles that are routinely used to measure distances out to @xmath4 @xcite , the rate of events unfortunately appears to decline at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "however , it is necessary to observe the universe at redshift @xmath5 to constrain the dark - energy equation of state parameter @xmath6 by breaking the degeneracies between cosmological models @xcite .    at higher redshifts , e.g. , @xmath7 , core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) strongly dominate the rates of sne @xcite .",
    "moreover , with more powerful telescopes to be launched , e.g. , the _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) , ccsne may be discovered at redshifts up to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "but in general , ccsne are much fainter than sne ia .",
    "they do not have the same intrinsic luminosities and their peak magnitudes do not exhibit any correlation with the decline rates @xcite .",
    "this problem may be solved by considering a certain type of ccsne : a subclass of broad - lined type ic sne which are observed to be associated with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "first observed by the vela satellites in 1967 @xcite , grbs are flashes of narrow beams of intense electromagnetic radiation whose peak energies occur at gamma - ray wavelengths @xcite .",
    "sn 1998bw was first detected to be associated with grb 980425 @xcite . since then , many grb - sne have been found @xcite .",
    "grb - sne have relatively smooth optical spectra and very large explosion energies @xcite .",
    "the peak magnitudes of grb - sne are in the same range as sne ia .",
    "moreover , their peak magnitudes are correlated with their decline rates @xcite .",
    "while grb - sne are rare and difficult to disentangle from the contaminating light of the grb afterglow and host galaxy , these properties could make grb - sne a powerful tool for distance determination and constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "this paper is devoted to the first quantitative exploration of this idea .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : data ] , we briefly review the procedure of obtaining light curves of grb - sne , and measuring peak magnitudes and decline rates .",
    "we also present an estimate of the peculiar velocity of the host galaxy of the low - redshift sn 1998bw . in section [ sec : candle ] , we establish grb - sne as standard candles based on a limited set of high - quality grb - sne . in section [ sec : cos ] we create a hubble diagram and place constraints on the matter density parameter assuming a flat @xmath9cdm cosmological model .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .",

    "+ @xmath14 : more details are in section [ sub : pec ] .",
    "+    the selected grb - sne are firmly associated with grbs from class _ a _ to class _ c _ @xcite , where class _ a _ has ` strongest spectroscopic evidence ' . here",
    "we briefly summarize the discussion of the steps in obtaining the light curves of grb - sne .",
    "more details on the procedure are in @xcite .",
    "the systems are listed in table [ listgrbsn ] .",
    "the afterglow is either fitted to power - law or broken power - law functions and subtracted .",
    "both galactic and host extinction are corrected for . for the galactic extinction ,",
    "we assume @xmath15 and get @xmath16 from the dirbe / iras dust map @xcite .",
    "the values are re - calibrated based on table 6 in @xcite .",
    "we take the values of host extinction from the literature .",
    "we fit low - order polynomial functions to obtain the light curves .",
    "a k correction method is developed to correct the peak magnitudes and decline rates into the rest frame v band .",
    "a ` multi - band k - correction ' is used for systems which have two band data available and these two bands are close to the redshifted v band .",
    "otherwise , sn 1998bw peak sed and decline rate templates are used to correct the peak magnitude and the decline rate from the light curve obtained at a wavelength close to the redshifted v band . in total eight light curves of grb - sne with @xmath17 up to 0.606 are obtained in the rest frame v band @xcite .",
    "sn 1998bw @xcite was the first sn discovered to be connected with a grb ( grb 980425 ) .",
    "it is the nearest grb - sn so far , and the measured redshift is @xmath18 @xcite , so it constitutes an important low - redshift anchor of the hubble diagram . for the recessional velocity of this low - redshift system",
    ", the contribution from the peculiar velocity may be relatively substantial .",
    "the true recessional velocity @xmath19 due to the hubble flow should be corrected for the peculiar velocity @xmath20 of the host galaxy : @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the velocity relative to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .    in order to estimate the peculiar velocity of its host galaxy , eso 184@xmath23g82 , and calculate the uncertainty in the distance modulus",
    ", we use a dark matter simulation performed as a part of the constrained local universe simulations ( clues ) project .",
    "the simulation is carried out in a volume of @xmath24 containing @xmath25 particles .",
    "the assumed cosmological model is based on the 3rd data release of the wmap satellite ( wmap3 cosmology ) , i.e. , matter density @xmath26 , dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath27 , and normalization of the power spectrum @xmath28 .",
    "the initial conditions are generated from observational data of the galaxy distribution and galaxy velocities in the local universe ( for technical details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this setup",
    ", the simulation recovers all observed structures on scales larger than @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , all nearby galaxy clusters and superclusters , such as the virgo cluster , the coma cluster , the great attractor and the perseus ",
    "pisces cluster , are well reproduced in the final simulation snapshot . on the other hand ,",
    "small scale structures formed in the simulation emerge from a random realization of the power spectrum on these scales . their evolution ,",
    "however , is strongly constrained by nearby large - scale structures .",
    "therefore , the simulation provides a realistic and dynamically self - consistent model for the matter distribution and the velocity field in the local universe .",
    "the position vector of the host galaxy with respect to the local group in the simulation box can be found be matching angular separations from several large - scale structures .",
    "as the reference structures , we use the coma cluster , the perseus ",
    "pisces cluster and the great attractor .",
    "having determined the direction to the host galaxy from the local group in the simulation box , we compute the radial components of peculiar velocities within a narrow light cone .",
    "figure  [ pec ] shows the resulting projected peculiar velocities as a function of the comoving distances from the local group .",
    "the blue dots show velocities of dark matter particles , whereas the red symbols represent dark matter haloes found with the friends - of - friends algorithm .",
    "lack of dark matter haloes at small distances is related to the fact that the line of sight crosses the edge of the local void ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to identify the position of the host galaxy eso 184@xmath23g82 in the simulation box , we use a range of plausible distances to the host galaxy in units of mpc / h so they are independent of @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the true recessional velocity is likely between the host velocity with respect to the cmb @xmath31 km s@xmath32 @xcite and the host velocity with respect to the local large - scale structures ( virgo , great attractor and shapley supercluster ) @xmath33 km s@xmath32 , as shown in the green band in figure  [ pec ] . within the green band ,",
    "the mean peculiar velocity is @xmath34 km s@xmath32 with a mean systematic error @xmath35 km s@xmath32 .",
    "combined with the peculiar velocity @xmath20 and the cmb velocity @xmath36 , the hubble flow velocity is @xmath37 km s@xmath32 , which is in the green band in figure  [ pec ] , as expected .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath38 dominates the uncertainty of @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding redshift is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the peculiar velocity of the the host galaxy to uncertainty in the distance modulus of sn 1998bw is @xmath40 mag , where @xmath41 is the speed of light and @xmath42 is the uncertainty of peculiar velocity @xmath20 .",
    "in much the same way as sne ia were used to measure the cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite , here we use grb - sne as standard candles .",
    "similar to sne ia @xcite , grb - sne have bright peak luminosities .",
    "the luminosity - decline rate relation for grb - sne in the rest - frame v band is @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the slope and @xmath45 is a constant representing the absolute peak magnitude at @xmath46 .",
    "assuming @xmath47 and @xmath48 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 @xcite , we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this relation is superior to other similar relations @xcite , such as the @xmath51 relation @xcite , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the relative peak and width of the light curves compared to sn 1998bw , or the relation between the peak magnitude and the elapsed time since grb . with @xmath54 from @xcite , obtained using the above planck cosmology , the corrected apparent peak magnitude in the rest - frame v band is @xmath55 where @xmath11 is the corrected apparent magnitude in the rest - frame v band after corrections for dust extinction and k correction @xcite . here",
    "@xmath56 is the distance modulus at @xmath47 and @xmath48 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 in a flat universe .",
    "the values of @xmath11 are listed in table [ listgrbsn ] . considering the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq;relation ] ) , the effective apparent peak magnitude @xmath57 can be obtained as @xmath58 the term @xmath59 represents the correction due to the luminosity - decline rate relation .",
    "the effective apparent magnitude can also be expressed as @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath30-free  luminosity distance in units of km s@xmath62 , with @xmath63 being the luminosity distance in units of mpc @xcite and @xmath30 in units of km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath64 is the @xmath30-free  v - band absolute peak magnitude @xcite .",

    "as shown in this paper , grb - sne may add further constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "with more systems at @xmath17 up to 1 , the result would be more constraining , but we have opted here for systems with very well sampled light curves . at higher redshifts ( @xmath7 ) , with more powerful telescope to be launched , e.g. , _ jwst _ , grb - sne are potential candidates to break the degeneracies and constrain the equation of state parameter @xmath6 @xcite .",
