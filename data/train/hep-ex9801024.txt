    "this paper describes a search for photonic events with large missing energy in @xmath11 collisions at centre - of - mass energies of 130 , 136 , 161 and 172 gev .",
    "two different search topologies are used .",
    "cross - section measurements and search results from single - photon and acoplanar - photons topologies at @xmath59-@xmath60 gev@xcite and @xmath61 gev@xcite have been previously published .",
    "those results have also been used to search for excited neutrinos with photonic decays at @xmath59-@xmath60  gev  @xcite and @xmath61  gev  @xcite . in the analyses presented in this paper , both the single and acoplanar - photons search techniques are based on those previously published by opal , but in each case the kinematic acceptance of the analysis has been extended to lower energy and more forward angles , and the efficiency has been increased by allowing for the possibility of photon conversions .",
    "these results supersede our previous results .",
    "the single - photon and acoplanar - photons search topologies presented here are designed to select events with one or more photons and significant missing transverse energy , indicating the presence of at least one neutrino - like invisible particle which interacts only weakly with matter .",
    "results on photonic events without missing energy are presented in a separate paper.@xcite .",
    "the single - photon search topology is sensitive to neutral events in which there are one or two photons and missing energy , which within the standard model are expected from the @xmath1 process .",
    "measurements of single - photon production have been made in @xmath11 collisions at the @xmath62 and at lower energies  @xcite .",
    "results from centre - of - mass energies significantly above the @xmath62 mass have also been reported  @xcite .",
    "the expected visible energies are sufficiently large at present centre - of - mass energies that doubly radiative neutrino pair production can lead to two photons being detected ; the experimental topology therefore includes such cases .",
    "the acoplanar - photons search topology is designed to select neutral events with two or more photons and significant missing transverse energy , which within the standard model are expected from the @xmath2 process .",
    "the selection is designed to retain acceptance for events with a number of photons , @xmath63 , greater than two if the system formed by the three most energetic photons shows evidence for significant missing transverse energy .",
    "these photonic final - state topologies are sensitive to new physics of the type @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is neutral and decays radiatively ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath5 is stable and only weakly interacting . for the general case of massive @xmath66 and @xmath5 this includes conventional supersymmetric processes@xcite @xmath68 . in this context",
    "it has been emphasised @xcite that the radiative branching ratio of the @xmath69 may be large .",
    "there is particularly good sensitivity for the special case of @xmath70 that applies both to the production of excited neutrinos @xmath71 and to supersymmetric models in which the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a light gravitino(kev ) .",
    "] , and @xmath72 is the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) which decays to a gravitino and a photon , ( @xmath73 ) . in this case , the branching ratio of this decay of the @xmath72 is naturally large . such a signature has been discussed in  @xcite and more recently in  @xcite for a no - scale supergravity model and in  @xcite for a model with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ; in each case , @xmath74 production cross - sections of order 1 pb are predicted at these centre - of - mass energies , for @xmath75  gev .",
    "other types of new physics to which these search topologies are sensitive include the production of invisible particles made visible through initial - state radiation and the production of an invisible particle in association with a photon .",
    "the acoplanar - photons search topology also has sensitivity to the production of two particles , one invisible , or with an invisible decay mode , and the other decaying into two photons .",
    "such events might arise from the production of a higgs - like particle , @xmath76 : @xmath77 , followed by s@xmath78@xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "results for this model searching for the hadronic and leptonic @xmath81 decays appear elsewhere@xcite .",
    "this paper will first briefly describe the detector , the data sample and the monte carlo samples used , including a discussion of event generators for @xmath82 . the event selection for each search topology",
    "will then be described , followed by cross - section measurements for @xmath1 and @xmath2 and comparisons with standard model expectations .",
    "implications of these results on the possibility of new physics processes of the type @xmath64 or @xmath83 , @xmath67 will be discussed .",
    "the opal detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . the measurements presented here",
    "are mainly based on the observation of clusters of energy deposited in the lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeters ( ecal ) consisting of a 9,440 lead glass block array in the barrel ( @xmath84 ) with a quasi - pointing geometry , and two dome - shaped endcap arrays , each of 1,132 lead - glass blocks with axes coaxial with the beam axis covering the polar angle range ( @xmath85 ) . in the overlap region , @xmath86 , and at very forward angles , @xmath87 the energy - resolution of the ecal",
    "is slightly degraded relative to the nominal resolution . in some cases ( where stated ) these regions have been excluded from the analysis .",
    "these calorimeters , together with the gamma - catcher calorimeter , the forward calorimeters and the silicon - tungsten calorimeter ( siw ) , provide a fully hermetic electromagnetic calorimeter down to polar angles of 33  mrad .",
    "the siw calorimeter covers polar angles down to 24 mrad , however the region around 30 mrad lacks useful calorimetric coverage due to the installation , in 1996 , of a thick tungsten shield designed to protect the tracking chambers from accelerator backgrounds while running at centre - of - mass energies well above the @xmath62 resonance . the tracking system , consisting of a silicon microvertex detector , a vertex drift chamber ( cv ) and a large volume jet drift chamber ( cj ) , is used to reject events with prompt charged particles .",
    "the silicon microvertex detector consists of two concentric cylindrical layers of silicon microstrip arrays , each layer providing both an azimuthal and longitudinal ( along the beam direction ) coordinate measurement .",
    "the two layer acceptance covers @xmath88 for the 161 and 172 gev data - set while for the data acquired in 1995 at 130 and 136 gev , the acceptance is limited to @xmath89 .",
    "beam - related backgrounds and backgrounds arising from cosmic - ray interactions are rejected using information from the time - of - flight system , ( tof ) , the hadron calorimeter and muon detectors .",
    "the data used in this analysis were recorded at @xmath11 centre - of - mass energies of 130.3 , 136.2 , 161.3 , and 172.1  gev , with integrated luminosities of 2.30 , 2.59 , 9.89 , and 10.28  pb@xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the integrated luminosities are determined to better than 1% from small - angle bhabha scattering events in the siw luminosity calorimeter .",
    "triggers@xcite based on electromagnetic energy deposits in either the barrel or endcap electromagnetic calorimeters , and also on a coincidence of energy in the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter and a hit in the tof system , lead to full trigger efficiency for photonic events passing the event selection criteria described below .    for the expected standard model signal process , @xmath82 , the monte carlo generators nngg03",
    "@xcite , nunugpv  @xcite and koralz  @xcite were used .",
    "modelling of these backgrounds is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : evgens ] . for other expected standard model background processes ,",

    "susygen monte carlo events were generated at each centre - of - mass energy , for 16 - 24 points in the kinematically accessible region of the ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) plane for which @xmath101 gev , depending on the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "for the case @xmath70 , the efficiencies for @xmath102 and @xmath83 production obtained from these monte carlo samples are consistent within statistical errors with the efficiencies obtained from the opal @xmath103 and @xmath104 excited neutrino monte carlo samples respectively@xcite .",

    "two event generators , nngg03 and koralz were used extensively for studies of @xmath1 with a demonstrated agreement@xcite between the cross - section predictions of better than 1% .",

    "the absence of a complete lowest order calculation for @xmath108 and higher order corrections ( @xmath2 ) make it necessarily incomplete for @xmath2 .",
    "the koralz event generator , primarily designed for @xmath109 and @xmath110 at @xmath111 , can also generate @xmath82 , @xmath112 , using the yennie - frautschi - suura approach@xcite to explicitly generate an arbitrary number of additional initial state photons .",
    "this generator is maintained by the authors for @xmath113 , but no specific publications exist yet attesting to its accuracy for either @xmath114 or @xmath115 in this regime .",

    "an event generator based on this calculation is also available which includes the emission of an additional photon from each beam .",
    "this feature is designed to permit estimation of the effect of @xmath115 events on the @xmath114 acceptance .",
    "it is not intended as an accurate estimate of the @xmath115 cross - section . in a previous publication@xcite",
    ", we used this feature inappropriately to estimate the expected contribution from @xmath2 .    recently",
    ", independent calculations have been made of the @xmath108 ( lowest order ) cross - section using comphep@xcite ( by ambrosanio@xcite ) , and using helas@xcite ( by mrenna@xcite ) .",

    "these are approximately a factor of two lower than the @xmath115 cross - section predictions we obtain using the nngg03 and nunugpv event generators .",
    "the estimated @xmath115 cross - section from koralz agrees reasonably well with the independent calculations . for @xmath118",
    ", we have found that the estimated cross - section from koralz is lower by about 10% compared with nunugpv within the kinematic acceptance of the single - photon selection , described in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "koralz is used to estimate the detection efficiency of @xmath1 and @xmath2 given its more complete treatment of events with multiple photons .",
    "generator studies indicate that it also provides a reasonable estimate of the fraction of two photon events ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the estimated efficiencies obtained using koralz are compared with those obtained using nngg03 and nunugpv and only small differences are found , indicating that the experimentally measured cross - sections are relatively insensitive to the choice of generator .",
    "for coherence in the comparisons of data with monte carlo , we use koralz . in calculating upper limits on new processes for the single - photon topology , despite the claimed 1 - 2% accuracy of nunugpv",
    ", we use the background estimate from koralz which is the lower of the two and is therefore expected to be conservative .",
    "given the current status of calculations of @xmath2 , where factor of two differences between some cross - section estimates are not yet fully understood , in calculating limits on new processes for the acoplanar - photons topology we do not take into account the @xmath115 background estimate .",
    "this section describes the criteria for selecting single - photon and acoplanar - photons events .",
    "the kinematic acceptance of each topology is defined in terms of the photon energy , @xmath119 and the photon polar angle , @xmath120 , defined with respect to the electron beam direction . in order to simultaneously maintain sensitivity to low photon energies and to retain acceptance at high polar angles , the kinematic acceptance of each selection",
    "is composed of two ( possibly overlapping ) parts :    single - photon - : :    one or two photons accompanied by invisible particle(s ) :    +    * at least one photon with @xmath121 and    @xmath122 , or ,    * at least one photon with @xmath123 and    ( @xmath124 .",
