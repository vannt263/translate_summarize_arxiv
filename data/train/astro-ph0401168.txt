    "another advantage of our approach is that no _ a priori _ assumptions are made as to the optical depths in the radiative transitions forming the recombination cascade ( assumptions usually expressed as `` case a '' or `` case '' b , following osterbrock , 1989 , for example ) ; a self - consistent solution is automatically obtained .",

    "the spectral region around @xmath27  is now filled with strong emission arising principally from the decay of odd parity levels to the numerous even parity levels near @xmath28ev .",
    "as noted in table  [ tab : iron_per_fluxes ] , a significant fraction of the total iron flux comes out in the form of transitions .    in both of these models ,",
    "fluorescent excitation by lyman-@xmath10 is unimportant due to the absence of significant line - overlap with any transitions .",

    "re - performing the u20h96 model without lyman-@xmath0 fluorescent excitation resulted in a reduction in the total predicted flux of only about 12% ; the reduction in the case of u13h11 from the absence of lyman-@xmath0 fluorescent excitation was negligible .      according to table  [ tab : iron_per_fluxes ] ,",

    "( 1995 ) and in iras  07598 + 6508 by kwan _",

    "the current calculations tend to support these identifications and the occurrence of transitions in some agn spectra . comparing our predictions to the iras 07598 + 6508 spectrum given by kwan _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( their figure  1 ) , we note that the observed flux relative to the nearby flux between @xmath44  is much larger than predicted by our models , even when considering the effect of the tentative blends identified by kwan _",
    "et al .  _",
    "however , it is likely that our models underestimate the flux ; the very limited atomic model employed artificially suppresses recombination by omitting energy levels within @xmath45ev of the continuum .",
    "this acts both to reduce the recombination contribution the line fluxes and to lower the ionization fraction which also leads to weaker lines .",
    "we plan to extend our treatment of the atomic model in the future to provide more realistic flux estimates to compare with these observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fe123_parplot ] summarizes the dependence of the , , and fluxes on the various model parameters .",
    "the trend of increasing iron line fluxes with both ionization parameter and particle density is evident , as well as the maximization of the fluxes for the higher ionization parameter models .",
    "the figure also shows increased flux in and for either an increased cloud turbulent velocity or an increased iron abundance .",
    "interestingly , however , the predicted flux does not depend on the internal cloud turbulent velocity .",
    "the lines of are weak and unsaturated so are insensitive to the turbulent velocity , contrary to the lines of the other ionization stages . from this figure",
    "it might seem that the internal cloud turbulent velocity might be deducible from the spectrum of an object exhibiting lines of both and .",
    "in fact , this is the classic technique in stellar atmospheres to determine the turbulent velocity dispersion ( often dubbed microturbulence)forcing weak and strong lines to be reproduced in strength by the same abundance",
    ". it might be worthwhile to attempt this in agn ; however , the situation is much more complex as the entire blr spectrum is likely not formed within a single cloud or ensemble of identical clouds ( baldwin _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) ; the question would arise as to whether clouds of different ionization parameters and particle densities would have similar turbulent velocities . nevertheless it would be still worthwhile to attempt this investigation .",
    "knowledge of the intrinsic width of an emission line for individual clouds in the blr has important implications on the uncertain nature of the blr clouds themselves .",
    "narrow , near thermal widths of @xmath46  imply large numbers of blr clouds in oder to reproduce the smooth observed line profiles .",
    "much larger intrinsic widths would require fewer clouds to produce smooth profiles , perhaps allowing stellar models for the blr clouds to become viable ( peterson , pogge & wanders , 1999 ) .",
    "vestergaard & wilkes ( 2001 ) provide an empirical - uv template ( @xmath47 ) derived from i  zw  1 , the prototypical narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "one of the main results of this work is the careful documentation of extensive emission from i  zw  1 , building on the identifications of laor _ et al .  _",
    "figure  [ fig : panel_1zw1 ] compares four of our basic models with a solar iron abundance and minimal turbulent velocity ( 10@xmath48 ) with the i  zw  1 template . in these comparisons ,",
    "the calculations have been broadened by convolution with a gaussian to @xmath49(fwhm ) , and the template has been normalized to the median model flux in the region of strongest flux included in the template wavelength region , @xmath50-@xmath51 .",
    "only our highest - density , highest ionization parameter model , u13h11 , correctly reproduces the overall level of the uv emission line strength in the @xmath52-@xmath53  region .",
    "thus we find that there is , in principle , no problem in accounting for the basic level of flux from i  zw  1 , even with a crude , single - zone model .",
    "while inspection of figure  [ fig : panel_1zw1 ] clearly reveals a strong correlation between the model and the empirical template , there are several disagreements in detail . in the principle wavelength region , @xmath50-@xmath54 ,",
    "the relative strengths of individual features are not correctly reproduced .",
    "most notable , however , is the failure of the basic model to correctly reproduce the strength of the feature near @xmath4  identified by laor _",
    "et al .  _",
    "this strong feature is associated with multiplet uv47 , the inter - system transition - , giving ( identified ) features near @xmath55  ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and @xmath58  ( @xmath59 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "finally , some of the disagreement in the @xmath60-@xmath61  region can be traced to our use of a limited model atom .    to assess the seriousness of these discrepancies",
    ", we have performed additional calculations along two fronts : first , we considered predictions of models in which the highly - uncertain fe - h charge - exchange reactions were omitted .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec : ion ] , omission of these rates can substantially alter the iron ionization balance for certain models ; secondly , we have performed a series of monte carlo simulations to assess the effect of errors in the basic atomic data have in the predicted line fluxes .",
    "we shall first discuss models omitted charge - exchange reactions .",
    "the important role played by the rather uncertain fe - h charge exchange reaction rates motivated us to compute a series of models in which these rates were omitted .",
    "the predicted iron ionization balances have already been discussed in section  [ sec : ion ] with the results shown in figure  [ fig : ion_bal_vt10_fep0_ncex ] . the predicted flux of model u20h96 without charge - exchange reactions is shown in figure  [ fig:1zw1_tagn20_ncex ] and these predictions may be compared with figure  [ fig : flux_tagn20_fe123 ] . as expected by the change in the ionization balance shown in figures  [ fig : ion_bal_vt10_fep0 ] and [ fig : ion_bal_vt10_fep0_ncex ] , the model without charge - exchange reactions has a lower flux and a higher flux .",
    "it is still the case that normalizing the predicted iron fluxes to the observed template in the interval @xmath50-@xmath54  results in an over - prediction of the flux , but the over - prediction is now less .",
    "now conspicuous in the model omitting charge - exchange reactions is the presence of strong lines of multiplet uv47 .",
    "however , this is not translated into a significantly better fit to the vestergaard & wilkes template as shown by the upper panel of figure  [ fig:1zw1_tagn20_ncex ] .",
    "while there is now a strong predicted feature at @xmath4  corresponding to , the fit to the flux retains strong features for @xmath62 , centred around @xmath63  ( - ) , which have no counterpart ( in terms of observed strength ) in the empirical template .",
    "we have also explored the possibility that the @xmath21  feature is strengthened by numerous , blended transitions by merging our predicted fluxes with the more extensive fluxes of sp03 based on an 829-level model atom .",
    "however , such merged line - lists did not help to improve the fit by much .",
    "the overall fit to the flux distribution is generally better for the higher density models ( @xmath64 ) but unfortunately these models do not predict strong features for multiplet uv47 , either with or without charge - exchange reactions .",
    "given that all of the models presented have shortcomings when compared to the vestergaard & wilkes template , it is important to assess the accuracy to which the iron line fluxes can be computed .",
    "this is a complex question , encompassing everything from the accuracy of the underlying blr cloud model(s ) and the approximations used in the numerical methods to the accuracy of the underlying atomic data . in this work , we will address only the latter issue by asking how accurately the iron line fluxes can be predicted given the sometimes large uncertainties in the basic atomic data .",
    "even this question is not completely straightforward .",
    "for example , a single @xmath6 value clearly affects the flux in the @xmath65 radiative transition .",
    "however , through the coupling of the atomic level populations by the statistical equilibrium equations , and the global coupling of the emitting volume through the transfer of radiation , a single @xmath6 value can possibly affect the fluxes in many lines . and",
    "similar observations can be made , in principle , for all of the remaining atomic data , including the photoionization and recombination rates and the collisional excitation and de - excitation rates . to address all of these interconnections in a consistent manner ,",
    "we have turned to the monte carlo simulation technique used by sigut ( 1996 ) .",
    "each fundamental atomic parameter ( @xmath6 value , effective collision strength , photoionization cross section , collisional ionization cross section , and charge - transfer reaction rate ) is assigned an uncertainty .",
    "given these uncertainties , a set of atomic data is randomly realized and used to solve the radiative transfer - statistical equilibrium problem for the iron fluxes .",
    "then , a new set of atomic data is randomly realized and the predicted fluxes for this new data found .",
    "this sequence is repeated , and the width of the distribution of each line flux can be taken as a measure of its uncertainly .",
    "table  [ tab : monte ] lists the basic atomic data uncertainties adopted for our collection of iron atomic data .",
    "the error assignment is kept deliberately simple ; in principle , uncertainties could be assigned on a transition by transition basis .",
    "the r - matrix collision strengths ( cbb rates ) for low ionization states computed under the iron project are the most accurate ones available .",
    "however , they also display extremely complicated structure due to autoionizing resonances in the near - threshold region which dominates the rate coefficient at @xmath66k .",
    "therefore , uncertainties as large as a factor of @xmath67 for individual transitions can not be ruled out .",
    "the @xmath6 values ( rbb rates ) are expected to be more accurate ; however , significant errors may still be present , particularly in several calculations where relativistic effects have not been considered in an _ ab initio _ manner .",
    "such calculations are now in progress , but the computations are about an order of magnitude more difficult that those in ls coupling ( see nahar , 2003 ) .",
    "the distribution of the random scalings is also kept very simple : a set of uniform random deviates , @xmath68 , is computed with the ran2 algorithm of press _ et al .  _",
    "given the uncertainty assignment , @xmath69 , from table  [ tab : monte ] , a uniform set of deviates for the logarithm of the scaling is found from the linear relation @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the actual set of scalings , @xmath73 , is taken as @xmath74 .",
    "this procedure ensures the following common - sense property of the scalings : for example , if a charge - exchange rate is assumed accurate to within a factor of 100 , then one might expect the a scaling from @xmath75 to be as likely as one from @xmath76 .",
    "however , this procedure also results in the mean scaling being different from one , namely @xmath77 ; for example , the mean scaling for @xmath78 is about @xmath79 .",
    "thus the most probable value for the rate is not that adopted in the default ( unscaled ) atomic model .",
    "however , given the uncertainty ( a factor of 100 in this case ) , we do not consider this deviation significant .",
    "figure  [ fig : monte ] summarizes the uncertainties due to the atomic data uncertainties in table  [ tab : monte ] on the predicted - flux for model u13h11 .",
    "this model blr was chosen as it gave the best fit to the overall - flux levels in the vestergaard & wilkes template .",
    "charge - exchange reactions between iron and hydrogen were included in this calculation , although assumed uncertain to within a factor of 10 ( table  [ tab : monte ] ) .",
    "the top panel displays the minimum and maximum predicted flux at each wavelength and the middle panel shows the standard deviation of each predicted flux expressed as a percentage of the average flux at that wavelength .",
    "the largest uncertainties approach 30% for the features near 2000 .",
    "this reflects mostly the scaling of the charge - exchange reaction rates which strongly affects the - ionization balance .",
    "much smaller uncertainties are predicted for the bulk of the emission ; this smaller uncertainty reflects , to some extent , the large number of individual transitions contributing to each wavelength in the broadened spectrum ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : monte ] ) , each with an individually scaled uncertainty following table  [ tab : monte ] . in light of this figure , the detailed discrepancies between the i  zw  1 template of vestergaard & wilkes and the computed model model shown in figure  [ fig : panel_1zw1 ] are mostly explained as uncertainties in the underlying atomic data .",
    "the primary aim of this continuing project is to incorporate advanced methods of non - lte radiative transfer from stellar astrophysics into emission line analysis of agn . in the current work ,",
    "we have provided predictions for the entire low - ionization spectrum of iron , focusing on . given the preliminary nature of the models , and the use of only single - zone blr cloud models , a reasonable fit to the - uv template of vestergaard & wilkes for i  zw  1 was obtained .",
    "an aspect in which our treatment is incomplete is in the detailed treatment of the atom , the dominant ionization state in the fully ionized optically thin region of blr models .",
    "the atomic data for are in hand , computed from the iron project , and we plan to incorporate those into a further extension of the present work on par with and .",
    "the lines may also contribute to uv spectra of blr ; for example , see observations of the orion nebula using hst ( rubin _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .    in addition",
    ", the @xmath4  feature in the computed and observed spectra offers a diagnostics of atomic processes and physical conditions and of uncertainties in atomic data .",
    "the combined role of these factors in determining the intensity of this emission feature may be illustrated by considering level - specific @xmath80 recombination .",
    "an increase in the recombination - cascade rates might lead to : ( a ) less of a role for charge - exchange , as inferred by the non - charge - exchange models , ( b ) enhancement of the @xmath81 feature due to recombination contribution to the line , and ( c ) less flux in short - ward of @xmath82 , consistent with observations .",
    "the present recombination rates were derived from level - specific photoionization cross sections of computed in ls coupling ( nahar & pradhan 1994 ) .",
    "later work has shown ( pradhan , nahar & zhang 2001 , nahar & pradhan 2003 ) that near - threshold resonance complexes may affect the recombination rates by up to several factors .",
    "it is necessary to consider relativistic fine structure and resolve the resonance complexes in great detail ( excited metastable state cross sections are affected much more than than the ground state ) .",
    "nahar & pradhan ( 2003 ) have developed a scheme for unified calculations of electron - ion recombination , including both the radiative and the dielectronic recombination processes .",
    "such level - specific calculations for total recombination into the levels may possibly resolve the discrepancy in the observed and computed intensities of the @xmath4  feature .",
    "it is therefore not an exaggeration to say that in spite of the present scale of this effort , both in terms of atomic physics and radiative transfer , considerable work is still needed to improve the models .",
