    "this paper is the continuation of our previous work @xcite where we proposed a toric mirror symmetry test using toric residues .",
    "the idea of this test has appeared in the paper of morrison - plesser @xcite who observed that the coefficients of some power series expansions of unnormalized yukawa couplings for mirrors of calabi - yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties @xmath3 can be interpreted as generating functions for intersection numbers of divisors on some sequences of toric varieties @xmath4 parameterized by lattice points @xmath5 in the mori cone @xmath6 of @xmath3 . due to results of mavlyutov @xcite , it is known that the unnormalized yukawa couplings can be computed using the toric residues introduced by cox @xcite . in our paper @xcite , we formulated a general mathematical conjecture , so called _ toric residue mirror conjecture _ , which describes some power series expansions of the toric residues in terms of intersection numbers of divisors on a sequence of simplicial toric varieties @xmath4 ( we call them morrison - plesser moduli spaces ) .",
    "this conjecture includes all examples of mirror symmetry for calabi - yau hypersurfaces in gorenstein toric varieties associated with reflexive polytopes .",
    "since the toric mirror symmetry construction exists also for calabi - yau complete intersection in gorenstein toric fano varieties @xcite , it is natural to try to extend our conjecture to this more general situation .    the case of calabi - yau complete intersections of @xmath0 hypersurfaces @xmath7 defined by laurent polynomials @xmath8 $ ] in @xmath9-dimensional toric varieties @xmath3 was not considered by morrison and plesser in @xcite .",
    "we remark that in this case one _ does not _ get a connection to the `` quantum cohomology ring '' @xcite as in the hypersurface case .",
    "this difference is explained by the consideration of a non - reflexive @xmath10-dimensional polytope @xmath11 , so called cayley polytope , and its secondary polytope @xmath12 .",
    "the cayley polytope @xmath11 appears from the cayley trick which introduces @xmath0 additional @xmath0 variables @xmath13 and a new polynomial @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the usual toric residue @xmath15 associated with @xmath16 and define the _",
    "@xmath17-mixed toric residue _",
    "@xmath18 corresponding to a positive integral solution @xmath19 of the equation @xmath20 as a @xmath17-th homogeneous component of @xmath15",
    ". we expect that the @xmath17-mixed toric residues are similar to the usual toric residues .",
    "in particular , we introduce the notion of the _ @xmath17-mixed hessian @xmath21 _ of laurent polynomials @xmath22 and conjecture that the value of @xmath18 on @xmath23 is exactly the mixed volume @xmath24 where @xmath25 are newton polytopes of @xmath26 .",
    "our generalization of the toric residue mirror conjecture for calabi - yau complete intersections uses the notions of the nef - partition @xmath27 of @xmath9-dimensional reflexive polytope @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "in this situation , one obtains a dual nef - partition @xmath29 and two more reflexive polytopes : @xmath30 it is important that special coherent triangulations of @xmath31 define coherent triangulations of the cayley polytope @xmath32 .",
    "therefore the choice of such a triangulation @xmath33 of @xmath31 determines a vertex @xmath34 of the secondary polytope @xmath12 and a partial projective simplicial crepant desingularization @xmath35 of the gorenstein toric variety @xmath36 .",
    "so one obtains a sequence of simplicial toric varieties @xmath37 associated with the lattice points @xmath5 in the mori cone @xmath6 of @xmath3 .",
    "we conjecture that the generating function of intersection numbers @xmath38 coincides with the power series expansion of the @xmath17-mixed toric residue @xmath39 at the vertex @xmath40 . the precise formulation of this conjecture is given in section 4 .    in sections 5 , 6",
    "we check our conjecture for nef - partitions corresponding to calabi - yau complete intersections in weighted projective spaces @xmath41 and in product of projective spaces @xmath42 .",
    "the final section is devoted to applications of the toric residue mirror conjecture to the computation of yukawa couplings for calabi - yau complete intersections .",
