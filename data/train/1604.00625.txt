    "sar imaging is extensively used for monitoring various types of natural hazards and disasters .",
    "these include but are not limited to earthquakes and faults , landslides , volcanic activity , flooding , fires , hurricanes , tsunamis and oil spills @xcite .",
    "satellite systems became invaluable tools for early warning and post disasters assessment studies since they provide a large scale view of the disaster area .",
    "this is critically important to identify the effected areas by the disaster .",
    "compared to some small scale monitoring systems , they can also provide information about the extent of the disaster in the inhabited areas .",
    "various types of sensors , imaging modalities and image formation techniques are used in satellite systems which are used for monitoring the disasters .",
    "a review of the satellite sensors and associated image processing techniques used for monitoring the natural hazards and disasters can be seen in @xcite .",
    "sar imagery is also used for monitoring the oceans . the first satellite used for acquiring imagery from the ocean environment and",
    "the first civilian satellite with a sar sensor was the seasat satellite .",
    "it was launched by usa in 1978 .",
    "after that , many satellites such as ers-1 , ers-2 , radarsat-1 , radarsat-2 , envisat and alos were placed on their orbits for monitoring both the ocean and land surface .",
    "measurements of ocean surface waves and spectra , wave refraction and breaking , wind speed and direction , upwelling , sea ice , ocean currents and current gradients , oceanic internal waves , marine atmospheric boundary layers , underwater topography and detection of ships and wakes are just a few examples where sar imaging is used for oceanographic studies @xcite .",
    "sar imagery is also used to detect oil spills and surfactants @xcite .",
    "oil on the ocean surface can be released from ships , result from seepage from sea bottom or can be spilled from offshore platforms after collapses , fires or even under normal operating conditions .",
    "bragg scattering is the dominant mechanism of the electromagnetic wave scattering from the ocean surface .",
    "short gravity - capillary waves on the ocean surface are the most responsible components of the ocean wave spectra for the radar back scatter from ocean surface @xcite",
    ". mineral oil on the ocean surface damps these gravity - capillary waves .",
    "therefore the radar back scatter reduces and oil appears as dark patches in the sar imagery @xcite .",
    "oil spill on the ocean surface can be treated as a two layer flow in terms of hydrodynamics .",
    "realistic ocean wave models such as given in @xcite can be extended for two layer flow including the capillary effects which are characterized by surface tension and curvature of the ocean surface to model the oil spill on the ocean surface .",
    "some similar studies can be seen in @xcite where generally approximate ocean models are used . while these studies can provide a better understanding of the physics which governs the scattering of microwaves from the ocean surface they may not be the best way to understand the larger dynamics of oil spill on the ocean surface since they do not provide a global assessment .    in this paper ,",
    "the detection of the oil spill by sar imagery is discussed .",
    "the change detection algorithms are used to compare and detect the changes due to oil spill .",
    "the specific algorithms used for this purpose are the correlation coefficient change statistics and the intensity ratio change statistics .",
    "a review of these algorithms is presented .",
    "these algorithms are applied to data and an assessment of the two algorithms is provided .",
    "additionally , a recently offered methodology which can reduce the probability of false alarms associated with detection of the changes is applied .",
    "this method depends on the idea of generating two change maps of any two images in a three image sequence .",
    "this methodology is applied to 2010 gulf of mexico oil spill data which is acquired by palsar of the alos satellite .",
    "comparisons between imagery acquired at different times can be made by some mathematical techniques known as change detection ( cd ) algorithms .",
    "they are used to extract information about the changes occurred in a scene .",
    "these changes can be in the magnitude , location and the direction of the scene .",
    "cd algorithms are widely used in digital image and video processing to detect temporal changes in one or multiple scenes @xcite .",
    "they have the capability to detect very subtle changes both in the intensity and the phase values which may not be seen by the human eye . for ideal change detection",
    ", the imagery should be acquired by the same or similar sensor and using the same resolution , viewing angle and geometry , spectral bands , time of the day and season @xcite .",
    "change detection mapping and analysis can be applied to various types of imagery obtained by different sensing systems such as radar , optical , multispectral or lidar , just to name a few .",
    "cd can be applied in various disciplines including but not limited to remote sensing , surveillance , medical imaging , civil infrastructure and underwater sensing .",
    "sar imagery is widely used for both civilian and military reconnaissance .",
    "earthquake , flood , tsunami , hurricane damage assessment , monitoring oil spills , extreme snow and ice conditions , fires , deforestation , illegal ship traffic , structural damages , military constructions and operations are a few examples to mention where the airborne and satellite sar imagery are widely used .",
    "currently there are many change detection algorithms available for use .",
    "it is possible to create a classification matrix or tensor of change detection algorithms .",
    "one possibility is to make a classification based on the dimensions of the imagery , as 2d or 3d change detection algorithms . generally , depending on the phase values used or not , the cd algorithms are classified as non - coherent or coherent change detection algorithms .",
    "non - coherent change detection identifies changes in the mean back scattered power of the scene by comparing sample estimates of the mean back scatter power taken from the repeat pass image pair however coherent change detection also accounts for the changes in the phases . in this paper",
    "only non - coherent change detection is considered .",
    "two very widely used change detection algorithms , the correlation coefficient change statistic and the intensity ratio change statistic algorithms are used to make an assessment of the changed areas due to oil spill . a recently offered methodology which first appeared in @xcite and",
    "depends on generating double change map in a temporal sequence with three images is used to reduce the false alarm probabilities . a review of these algorithms and the double change map methodology is provided in the next section .",
    "the correlation coefficient between image pairs is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the decorrelations due to relative back scatter signal to receiver noise ratio , due to mismatch in the acquisition geometries between first and repeat - pass data collections , in the scene , due to scattering from a volume when a nonzero baseline is used in the acquisition and image processing , respectively .",
    "discussions about the partial contributions of these phenomena to the correlation coefficient can be seen in @xcite .",
    "generally @xmath6 so that @xmath3 is the indicator of the correlation between the image pair . from now on for the sake of brevity @xmath7 is used in this paper instead of @xmath3 .    for image pairs with intensities @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 the correlation coefficient , @xmath10 , is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of pixels in the neighborhood of the pixel @xmath13 and generally taken as @xmath14 or @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "@xmath17 refers to no change whereas @xmath18 refers to a very significant change in the scene .",

    ", the complex conjugate of either the first or the second image should be taken in the eq .",

    "a threshold is used to vote for if there is change or not between image pair .",
    "the selection of threshold exhibits a tradeoff between the probabilities of detection ( @xmath19 ) and false alarm ( @xmath20 ) therefore related probability density functions ( pdf ) need to be used .",

    "additionally it can be observed from the figure  [ ratiopdf2 ] above that , the back scatter ratio change ( @xmath68 ) of 3 db and @xmath65 yields @xmath69 which is an unacceptably high value @xcite .",

    "however since the disturbance size and the window size should be commensurate in order to prevent contributions from both changed and unchanged pixels , it is not possible to increase @xmath12 unboundedly @xcite .      in this section a recently offered change detection methodology which relies on the idea of generating two final change maps in order to reduce the probability of false alarm is used .",

    "however uncommon changed areas between the change map sequence is included in an absolute manner . by adopting this approach two different change maps comparing first and",

    "the changes present in both of the change maps are critical since they are more likely to indicate a detected change , not a false alarm .",
    "the changes which are not present in both of the change maps are more likely to be false detections .",
    "joint change maps are generated by taking the intersection of the two final change maps . since more than one change maps",

    "this result shows that the correlation between images are very high , even in the significantly changed regions .",
    "therefore the change detection becomes harder .",
    "additionally the correlation coefficient change statistic is more sensitive to the changes in the areas which are represented by bright pixels compared to the changes in the areas represented by dark pixels @xcite .",
    "therefore especially when the oil spill is close to land in an image , the correlation coefficient change statistics behaves poorly . using a threshold of @xmath74 ,",
    "the change maps can be obtained with the probabilities of @xmath75 and @xmath76 which can be read from the roc curves discussed in the previous section .",
    "this high value of probability of false alarm is selected as a trade off of having a high probability of detection to capture the oil spill changes in the vicinity of the peninsula .",

    "the resulting change maps can be seen in the figures  [ cmgulf1 ] and  [ cmgulf12 ] below .",
    "the intensity ratio change statistic performs excellent for the oil spill detection .",

    "the intensity ratio change statistic is again very successful in capturing the oil spill changes which can be seen in the figures  [ cmgulf2 ] and  [ cmgulf22 ] @xcite .",

    "these probabilities for the joint change map can be calculated as @xmath84 and @xmath85 . although the joint change maps obtained exhibits a small amount of reduction in @xmath19 it can be very beneficial for reducing the @xmath20 significantly . when higher values of @xmath19 is used in obtaining the two change maps",
    ", the joint change map will suffer less from the loss of @xmath19 , almost to an insignificant level @xcite .",
    "it is useful to remember that chandeleur islands is a very dynamic coastal region which is subject to many coastal processes such as hurricanes , floods , waves and coastal erosion .",
    "therefore they are subjected to significant erosion losses .",
    "it is useful to note that correlation coefficient change statistic can be used as a critical change measure for monitoring the coastal erosion amounts and rates @xcite .    in the figures  [ image_alpsrp231220550 ] ,  [ image_alpsrp237930550 ] and  [ image_alpsrp244640550 ] ,",
    "the co - registered images acquired at location 3 can be seen .    for the correlation coefficient change statistics algorithm on this image set ,",
    "the selection of representative changed and unchanged areas lead to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively . for a threshold of @xmath81 ,",
    "one can obtain the change maps with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the parameters for the intensity ratio change statistics is the same as before @xcite .    as it can be seen in change maps presented in the figures  [ cmgulf3 ] and  [ cmgulf32 ] , the intensity ratio change statistics still performs better .",
    "however the correlation coefficient change statistics is also successful in detecting the contaminated areas due to the oil spill .",
    "this is mainly because there is no land in the scene so that there are only very few bright pixels .",
    "for this reason , the correlation coefficient change statistics performs better compared to its previous performance on the previous image sets discussed above . also the oil surfactant in the first image in the sequence is denser compared to the second image .",
    "this causes the cd methods to behave better since change measures get more different from the threshold values @xcite .",
    "additionally , again the two final change map method reduces the number of false alarms .",
    "this can be realized by comparing the change map between the first and the third images ( cm 3 ) and the joint change map ( joint cm ) obtained by intersecting the cm 3 and the cumulative additions of cm 1 and cm 2 , both for the correlation coefficient and the intensity ratio change statistics .",
    "for the correlation coefficient change statistic the probabilities of false alarm and detection of the joint change map can be calculated as @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for the intensity ratio change statistic",
    ", the probabilities for the joint change map can be calculated as @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "when higher values of @xmath19 is used the joint change map will not suffer from the loss of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in this study an assessment of the existing non - coherent change detection techniques used in remote sensing is performed for the oil spill detection .",
    "two algorithms , the correlation coefficient change statistic and the intensity ratio change statistic algorithms are utilized for oil spill detection .",
    "these two algorithms are applied on sar imagery of the 2010 gulf of mexico oil spill which are acquired by japanese aerospace agency s advanced land observing satellite ( alos ) .",
    "additionally a new methodology is tested which can reduce the probability of false alarm .",
    "this methodology depends on the idea of generating two different final change maps of the initial and final images .",
    "first final change map is generated by cumulatively adding the sequences of change maps in a manner that common change areas are excluded and uncommon change areas are included .",
    "the second final change map is generated by comparing the first and the last images in the temporal sequence by the algorithm in use .",
    "although this method can be generalized to longer temporal image sequences , in this paper temporal sequences with three imagery are used .",
    "this approach provides a double check mechanism to the conventional approach and thus reduces the probability of false alarm .",
    "it is shown that the intensity ratio change statistic performs significantly better compared to the correlation coefficient change statistic for detection of the oil spill , especially if the oil spill is in the vicinity of the land .",
    "additionally it is shown that by taking the joint change map of the two final change maps , the double change map methodology reduces probability of false alarm significantly .    as a future work",
    ", other algorithms widely used in the literature can be tested for the detection of the oil spill in 2d or higher dimensions .",
    "the two final change map method employed in this paper can be tested with other change detection algorithms , except with those trivial ones which give the same result of the direct comparison of the first and the last image in the sequence , such as simple differencing or log - ratioing . also testing this methodology with other ccd algorithms for oil spills and other type of disasters",
