    "ejection of mass into diffuse component from a condensed phase changes velocity of the bulk flow , increases pressure in diffuse phase , and heats diffuse gas due to conversion of kinetic energy of evaporated / destroied clouds into thermal energy of bulk medium ( cowie , mckee & ostriker 1981 , hartquist 1986 ) . as a result ,",
    "loaded flows ( the flows dominated by mass input from a condensed phase ) can differ qualitatively from the ones in a homogeneous ( monophase ) medium . in a simplest approach",
    "mass loaded flows are described by dynamical equations with source terms . for accretion disks mass",
    "loading corresponds physically to a continuing mass infall on the disk surface from the residual gas envelope .",
    "extremely inhomogeneous structure of the diffuse interstellar gas and molecular clouds shows self - similarity on the scales from 0.02 ( the resolution threshold ) to 100 pc ( see , falgarone , phillips & walker 1991 ) .",
    "it seems obvious that such self - similarity can extend to much smaller scales corresponding to protoplanetary condensations in accretion disks .",
    "[ note that the resolution limit , 0.02 pc , corresponds to planetary masses of clumps , @xmath2 .",
    "one can expect that in such conditions clumpy gas from debries of the parent molecular cloud will provide a continuing matter infall on the accretion protoplanetary disk being already formed . in theoretical treatment of protoplanetary disks",
    "this circumstance is described by the source terms in mass and momentum equations ( see , safronov & vityazev 1983 , papaloizou & lin 1995 ) .",
    "multiple ci and co velocity components ( roberge 2000 ) , caii absorptions ( barnes , tobin & pollard 2000 ) and emission in feii , si , siii , niii and ci lines ( lecavelier des etangs 2000 ) , observed in @xmath3 pictoris , are seemingly connected with the infall of clumpy gas on the disk .",
    "similar detections of the infalling circumstellar gas have been reported for herbig ae / be stars ( grinin , natta & tambovtseva 1996 ) .",
    "one can assume that this phenomenon represents late stages of matter infall from a highly inhomogeneous primordial circumdisk cloud onto the accretion disk .",
    "if this is the case , and protoplanetary disks are loaded by infalling and passing through them dense clumps , both vertical and radial structure of such disks , the accretion rate and the temperature distribution can differ considerably from those in homegeneous ( monophase ) disks . in this paper",
    "we analyze properties of steady disks , concentrating mainly on radial temperature distribution , in a simple model of weak mass loading , when mass loading does not violate the keplerian flow of the bulk motion . in section 2.1",
    "we describe the model , in section 2.2 we formulate basic equations describing radial structure of thin accretion disks for weak mass loading limit , in section 2.3 we describe the solution of energy equation and find radial temperature distribution , and discuss possible observational manifestations , the effects of angular momentum input associated with mass loading on temperature distribution are discussed in sec .",
    "2.4 , section 3 summarizes the results .",
    "as a model of a mass - loaded disk which admits simple analytical description we will accept the following : an accretion disk is surrounded by a spherical `` subsystem '' of dense condensations formed of the debries of a parent cloud and orbiting around the central star ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this subsystem can be in a quasistationary state either because the condensations are nearly dissipationless , or an infinite ( in practice , very massive ) reservoir of gas replenishes dissipation of mass and energy . in the first case , the characteristic life time of the quasistationary orbits determined by interaction of the condensations with the diffuse component , with other condensations and with the disk itself , must be much larger than characteristic rotation period of the disk .",
    "for this to fulfill the following relations must hold , respectively    n_in_c , n_cn_c , n_dn_c , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the column densities of the diffuse intercloud gas over the whole circumdisk cloud , of a single clump , and of the disk , respectively , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the covering factor of clumps , @xmath9 is the clump radius , @xmath10 , the radius of the circumdisk cloud .",
    "these inequalities definitely fulfill for planetesimals or comet - like bodies . for gaseous clumps",
    "it is not so obvious , and one has to assume a large enough density contrast in order that the clumps were long - living and orbiting quasistationary . in the latter case when the clumps are not sufficiently dense , so that for instance @xmath11 and they are absorbed by the disk in a single encounter , the overall picture can be kept quasistationary due to replenishment of the clumps from the surrounding molecular cloud as shown schematically on fig .",
    "1 . a gas reservoir with radius @xmath12 pc can support continuous mass infall during the time @xmath13 myr with the rate @xmath14 yr@xmath1",
    "if the mean density is only @xmath15 @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is gas density in clumps , @xmath18 , the volume filling factor of the clumps ; optical depth corresponding to the whole ensemble of such clumps is as small as @xmath19 .",
    "as we will see below , mass loading even with one order of magnitude lower mass rate can produce observable effects .",
    "we will assume that the quasistationarity takes place in either way . with these assumptions",
    "the subsystem of clumps can be treated as stationary .",
    "when the clumps intersect the disk they lose a fraction of their mass due to stripping under the action of rayleigh - taylor instability ( see detailed discussion in hartquist 1986 , klein , mckee & colella 1994 ) . the subsystem of clumps is assumed in rest as a whole , @xmath20 , where the averaging is over the ensemble of clumps at given @xmath21 , such that the angular momentum input into the disk from destroying clumps is zero . more general case with @xmath22 will be discussed in sec . 2.4 .      in this framework",
    "the continuity eqation for thin disk is described by the equation    [ mass ] 1rddr(ru_r)= , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , ( the interrelation @xmath25 is assumed as well ) , @xmath26 , @xmath27 [ g @xmath16 s@xmath1 ] is the mass ejection rate from destroying clumps per unit volume . [ in general , @xmath29 may represent not only mass loading due to destroying cloudletts , but also mass infall onto the disk from the envelope ( safronov & vityazev 1983 ) , the effects of the mass transfer stream in cataclismic variable stars , and the mass loss through a wind ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ) ] .",
    "naviet - stokes equation for azimuthal component of a stationary disk with zero angular momentum input is written in a standard form ( see , shakura & sunyaev 1973 , pringle 1981 )    [ vazimut ] ddr(r^3u_r)=ddr ( r^3ddr ) , here @xmath30 is explicitly taken into account , @xmath31 is the local angular velocity , @xmath32 is the kinematical viscosity .",

    "obviously , the restrictions on the muss input @xmath29 are rather weak . formally ,",

    "assuming that for a weak loading the radial component @xmath42 is of the order @xmath43 ( see , pringle 1981 ) we arrive at    [ velofi ] u_^2=gmr , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the local azimuthal mach number , @xmath46 , the local sound speed . equations ( [ mass])-([vradial ] ) differ from the standard equations of thin accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , lyndel - bell & pringle 1974 , see also reviews by pringle 1981 , and papaloizou & lin 1995 ) by the sources due to mass loading in the r.h.s .",
    "of continuity equation ( [ mass ] ) and in equation for radial velocity ( [ vradial ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 can be estimated as    [ acrpar ] ~t_rt_dm_pm_01 , with the assumption that @xmath47 can have low or moderately high values , here @xmath48 is the viscosity parameter ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and thus its contribution to the r.h.s . of ( [ velofi ] ) is negligible , and in this sense the loading will be treated as weak .",
    "it is readily seen that approximately @xmath49 , and ( [ acrpar ] ) is equivalent to the condition that on one rotational period @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the infalling settles onto the generic keplerian motion quickly , and as long as the mass input from clumpuscules is small enough on one rotational period , ( [ criter ] ) fulfills , it can be treated as a weak loading .    defining the accretion rate as @xmath51 ( see pringle 1981 )",
    "one can obtain the following solutions of equations ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ vazimut ] ) for a weakly loaded ( @xmath52 ) disk    m = m_-2_r_^r r dr ,    = m_3 - 23_r_^r rdr , where @xmath53 is the total mass accretion rate ( the rate on the stellar surface ) ; note , that the mass rate provided by the accretion disk itself in the absence of mass loading is equal    m_0=m_-2_r_^rdr .",

    ": at @xmath86 in maximum it reaches an order of magnitude increase in comparison with mass - unloaded disks , the maximum itself shifts to a lower frequencies , and the energy excess in this frequency range is more obvious .",
    "these two examples show that additional heat input due to mass loading can be responsible ( or may contribute ) for fir excess observed from circumstellar disks around young stars ( see for a review natta , meyer , beckwith 1997 ) . in order to illustrate such a possibility we compare in fig .",
    "6 the spectrum expected from an optically thick mass - loaded disk seen face - on with the one observed in the chameleon cloud ( natta 1997 ) . for the modelled spectrum we assumed the distribution of infalling material of @xmath114 au in radius ( integration was over @xmath115 ) , its accretion mass rate @xmath116 yr@xmath1 , and the mass loading only @xmath117 , the central star is of @xmath118 , @xmath73 .",

    "it is readily seen that for the mass input rate in the form ( [ massfunc ] ) the contribution from the last term is of the same order of magnitude ( about 2/3 ) as of the third term , and thus never exceeds 30% for @xmath127 and 36% for @xmath128 .",
    "dissipation of kinetic energy of clumpy gas falling onto accretion disks from the debries of a parent protostellar molecular cloud significantly alters the radial temperature distribution .",
    "it can be important in outer parts of a reprocessing disk , where temperature decreases sufficiently @xmath129 , while the heat input rate associated with mass loading is approximately proportional to the square of the azimuthal velocity @xmath130 .",
    "thus , mass loading can naturally produce excess of emission in the long - wavelength range of seds of the accretion disks , and with an appropriate radial distribution of mass loading can reproduce observed fir excess . for a one - peak radial distribution of the infall rate localized at @xmath131 , the corresponding temperature in the hot ring for @xmath132 , @xmath133 is      [ wavelen ] _ m~6(l1  au)^1/2 ( m_pm_0)^-1/4 ( m_010 ^ -6  yr^-1)^-1/4  .",
    "it is readily seen that the extra luminosity produced by the infalling gas is proportional to the mass loading rate , @xmath134 , and for weak mass loading , @xmath135 , is small as compared to the total luminosity of an unloaded disk . however , it can result in an observable effect if the loading mass is deposited at large radii , so that the wavelength in the peak of emission ( [ wavelen ] ) falls into fir range where the reprocessing disk does not contribute singnificantly .",
