    "lithium nitride ( li@xmath1n ) is the only known stable alkali metal nitride . at ambient conditions it crystallizes in the hexagonal @xmath10 structure ( @xmath0li@xmath1n ) seen in fig .",
    "the structure consists of alternating li and li@xmath3n layers  @xcite .",
    "the basal @xmath11-plane contains edge sharing planar li hexagons centred by nitrogen .",
    "these planes are connected through a further lithium ion along the @xmath12-axis located directly on top of the n. each nitrogen is coordinated by eight lithium atoms in a hexagonal bipyramid geometry . within the li@xmath3n layers ( @xmath11-planes )",
    "the atoms are close - packed , while the li layers form an open structure . in the following the li above the n atom will be denoted as li(1 ) and the li atoms within the li@xmath3n layers will be denoted as li(2 ) , see fig .",
    "it is known that the bonding in this material is mainly ionic , with the three lithium atoms donating their @xmath13 electrons to the nitrogen , resulting in li@xmath14 ions and a n@xmath15 ion  @xcite .",
    "lithium nitride is a common material used in the solid - state battery technology  @xcite : the indirect band gap is about @xmath16 ev  @xcite and the material has exceptionally high li@xmath17 ion mobility  @xcite , which arises from the cationic vacancies within the [ li@xmath3n ] planes .",
    "the crystal is made of hexagonally close - packed layers of li@xmath3n , where the li atoms are denoted by li(2 ) .",
    "these layers are alternated by li layers , where the li is denoted by li(1 ) .",
    "the li(1 ) atom is placed inbetween the n in the li@xmath3n layers . ]",
    "sachsze and juza  @xcite found that the li(1 ) atom could easily be substituted by a transition metal atom .",
    "this possibility has recently generated a substantial amount of interest due to the large magnetic moment observed at the substituted site  @xcite .",
    "this magnetic moment supersedes that of the donor transition metal element and is attributed to the absence of orbital moment quenching and to on - site coulomb interactions  @xcite .",
    "these findings have led to predictions that transition metal doped li@xmath1n might be considered for replacing rare - earth permanent magnets  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic behaviour associated with the presence of transition metal atoms lead us to raise the question if magnetism is still triggered if non - magnetic atoms , or in the extreme case vacancies , are used as dopants in the structure of lithium nitride . in the present paper the effect of vacancy induced magnetism",
    "is studied theoretically using density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite methods .",
    "the electronic structure of the ordered @xmath0li@xmath1n crystal has been studied using density functional  @xcite and hartree - fock  @xcite theories .",
    "similar studies has been performed on the li ion vacated structure  @xcite , also using molecular dynamics  @xcite .",
    "none of these calculations took the spin - polarization of the charge density into account , and therefore magnetic effects were not reported previously .",
    "besides @xmath0li@xmath1n , two other polymorphs exist : the hexagonal @xmath18li@xmath1n stable at moderate pressure ( 4.2 kbar and 300 k )  @xcite and the cubic @xmath19li@xmath1n stable up to @xmath20 gpa  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that li@xmath1n retains its ionic character through the significant structural transformation  @xcite . upon pressure",
    ", the band gap is increased across the hexagonal ( @xmath21 ) to cubic ( @xmath22 ) structural transition .",
    "the increase in the magnitude of the band gap is a consequence of the loss of the lowest laying conduction band as one goes from @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the large ( @xmath24 ev ) gap @xmath19li@xmath1n material was found to show anomalous color , which could be due to presence of vacancies ( color centres )  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly found that the lithium vacancy concentration increases with doping , especially at the li(2 ) sites  @xcite . in the extreme case of linin , where full substitution of the li(1 ) atom with nickel has been achieved ,",
    "one of the li(2 ) sites is completely vacated , creating a crystal structure with the @xmath25 space group  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the presence of ni determines the magnetic properties of linin . on the other hand , in the absence of the transition metal , it is obvious to ask if @xmath5-orbital magnetism can be induced due to vacancies in this system .",
    "magnetism is most often associated with systems containing partially occupied @xmath26 or @xmath27shells . in transition metals or rare earth elements , hunds exchange energy and the kinetic energy",
    "are of similar magnitude , and magnetism may appear if the hund energy is large enough  @xcite .",
    "a similar discussion has been extended to @xmath28electronic systems , containing c , n or o  @xcite . in order to elucidate on the effect of vacancies on total energy and magnetism ,",
    "we have in this paper performed a dft study on the electronic structure of li@xmath1n with li atom vacancies . in our work",
    "we show that the creation of li atom vacancies within the perfect @xmath0li@xmath1n structure induces : ( i ) a volume collapse of a magnitude which depends on the symmetry position of the removed li atom , and also ( ii ) magnetism , with moments centred on the n ions . in the case of a removal of the li(1 )",
    "atom , a large structural collapse occurs which leads to the vanishing of the magnetic moment . for removal of li(2 ) atoms the volume reduction is not drastic , and a magnetic moment is still formed .",
    "we also compute the vacancy concentration needed to form long - range magnetic ordering between the vacancy - induced n - moments in this system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_compdet ] we introduce the theoretical tools used in the study , and present the computational details .",
    "section  [ sec_resdis ] first presents the calculated ground - state lattice parameters of li@xmath1n , and the effect of a complete removal of inter- and in - plane li atoms .",
    "we also investigate the partial , non - stoichiometric , replacement of one of the in - plane li atoms by a vacancy , employing the coherent potential approximation . in the second part of section  [ sec_resdis ] we present the band structure of li@xmath1n , with and without vacancies . at the end of section  [ sec_resdis ] ,",
    "the ordering of the magnetic moments is discussed .",

    "the electronic structures for all systems were obtained by kohn - sham density functional theory  @xcite .",

    "the full potential is taken into account in the fplapw method .    to model the non - stoichiometric substitution of li atoms with vacancies , we employed the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) within the emto method .",
    "the emto - cpa method together with the full - charge density ( fcd )  @xcite scheme has proven able to accurately determine the total energy due to anisotropic lattice distortions ( e.g hexagonal @xmath29-ratios ) for real systems with substitutional disorder @xcite .    for the fplapw calculations the plane - wave cutoff @xmath30 was set so that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the muffin - tin radius .",
