    "traversable wormholes , first conjectured by morris and thorne @xcite , are handles or tunnels in the spacetime topology connecting different regions of our universe or of different universes altogether .",
    "interest in traversable wormholes has increased in recent years due to an unexpected development , the discovery that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "this acceleration is due to the presence of _ dark energy _ , a kind of negative pressure , implying that @xmath0 in the friedmann equation @xmath1 .",
    "in the equation of state @xmath2 , the range of values @xmath3 results in @xmath0 . this range is referred to as _ quintessence dark energy_. smaller values of @xmath4 are also of interest .",
    "thus @xmath5 corresponds to einstein s cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath6 is referred to as _ phantom energy _",
    "here we have @xmath7 , in violation of the null energy condition . as a result , phantom energy could , in principle , support wormholes and thereby cause them to occur naturally .",
    "sections 2 - 4 discuss a combined model of quintessence matter and ordinary matter that could support a wormhole in einstein - maxwell gravity , once again suggesting that such wormholes could occur naturally .",
    "the theoretical construction by an advanced civilization is also an inviting prospect since the model allows the assumption of zero tidal forces .",
    "4 considers the effect of eliminating the electric field .",
    "a wormhole solution can still be obtained but only by introducing a redshift function that results in enormous radial tidal forces , suggesting that some black holes may actually be wormholes fitting the conditions discussed in this paper and so may be capable of transmitting signals , a possibility that can in principle be tested .",
    "our starting point for a static spherically symmetric wormhole is the line element @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "here @xmath10 is the _ shape function _ and @xmath11 is the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to prevent an event horizon .",
    "for the shape function , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radius of the _ throat _ of the wormhole .",
    "another requirement is the flare - out condition , @xmath14 ( in conjunction with @xmath15 ) , since it indicates a violation of the weak energy condition , a primary prerequisite for the existence of wormholes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the model proposed for supporting the wormhole consists of a quintessence field and a second field with ( possibly ) anisotropic pressure representing normal matter . here",
    "the einstein field equations take on the following form ( assuming @xmath16 ) :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the energy momentum tensor of the quintessence - like field , which is characterized by a free parameter @xmath19 such that @xmath20 . following kiselev @xcite ,",
    "the components of this tensor satisfy the following conditions :    @xmath21    @xmath22    furthermore , the most general energy momentum tensor compatible with spherically symmetry is @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the einstein - maxwell field equations for the above metric corresponding to a field consisting of a combined model comprising ordinary and quintessential matter are stated next @xcite . here",
    "@xmath25 is the electric field strength , @xmath26 the electric charge density , and @xmath27 the electric charge .",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 eq .",
    "( [ e : max4 ] ) can also be expressed in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total charge on the sphere of radius @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that for the normal - matter field we have the following equation of state for the radial pressure @xcite : @xmath35 for the lateral pressure we assume the equation of state @xmath36 generally , @xmath37 is not equal to @xmath38 , unless , of course , @xmath39 .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the factor @xmath40 is assumed to have the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath43 is the charge density at @xmath44 . as a result",
    ", @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 the next step is to obtain the shape function @xmath48 by deriving a differential equation that can be solved for @xmath49 . the easiest way to accomplish",
    "this is to solve eq .",
    "( [ e : einstein1 ] ) for @xmath50 and substituting the resulting expression in eq .",
    "( [ e : einstein2 ] ) , which , in turn , is solved for @xmath51 . after substituting this result in eq .",
    "( [ e : einstein3 ] ) and making use of eqs . ( [ e : eos1 ] ) and ( [ e : eos2 ] ) , we obtain the simplified form @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are dimensionless quantities given by @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58    eq . ( [ e : diffequ ] ) is linear and would readily yield an exact solution provided that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constants .",
    "this can only happen if @xmath59 for some constant @xmath60 .",
    "in the first part of this paper we will assume that @xmath61 , leading to the _ zero - tidal - force _ solution @xcite .",
    "whether occurring naturally or constructed by an advanced civilization , such a wormhole would be suitable for humanoid travelers .",
    "returning to eq .",
    "( [ e : diffequ ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ e : e2 ] ) , the integrating factor @xmath62 yields the solution @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an integration constant . from @xmath65 in sec .",
    "[ s : model ] , we obtain the shape function @xmath66.\\ ] ]",
    "in eq . ( [ e : solution1 ] ) , @xmath64 is an integration constant .",
    "so mathematically , @xmath67 is a solution for every @xmath64 , leading to @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) . physically , however , @xmath48 is going to satisfy the requirements of a shape function only for a range of values of @xmath64 .",
    "this problem can best be approached graphically by assigning some typical values to the various parameters and adjusting the value of @xmath64 , as exemplified by fig .",
    "1 . first observe that        if @xmath61 , then @xmath68 .",
    "for the given values @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , a suitable value for @xmath64 is @xmath74 , as we will see . substituting in eq .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath75 to locate the throat @xmath13 of the wormhole , we define the function @xmath76 and determine where @xmath77 intersects the @xmath34-axis , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . observe that fig .",
    "2 indicates that for     intersects the @xmath34-axis at @xmath13.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    @xmath78 , @xmath79 , so that @xmath15 for @xmath78 , an essential requirement for a shape function .",
    "furthermore , @xmath77 is a decreasing function near @xmath13 ; so @xmath80 , which implies that @xmath14 , the flare - out condition .",
    "with the flare - out condition now satisfied , the shape function has produced the desired wormhole structure . for completeness",
    "let us note that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "( suitable choices for @xmath64 corresponding to other parameters will be discussed at the end of the section . )    to the right of @xmath13 , @xmath48 keeps rising , but at @xmath83 , @xmath84 is still less than unity .",
    "so at @xmath85 , the interior shape function , eq .",
    "( [ e : shape2 ] ) , can be joined smoothly to the exterior function @xmath86 to check this statement , observe that @xmath87 while @xmath88 to the right of @xmath89 , @xmath90 as @xmath91 , so that in conjunction with the constant redshift function , the wormhole spacetime is asymptotically flat .",
    "( the components @xmath92 and @xmath93 are already continuous for the exterior and interior components , respectively @xcite . )    returning to eq .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) , an example of an anisotropic case is @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath69 , @xmath96 , and @xmath73 ; a suitable choice for @xmath64 is @xmath97 .",
    "the result is @xmath98 here @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "an example of a value of @xmath19 closer to @xmath101 , the lower end of the quintessence range , is the following : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath96 , and @xmath104 . letting @xmath105 ,",
    "the shape function is @xmath106 this time @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "+   + * summary : * the emphasis in this paper is on the isotropic case @xmath39 since a cosmological setting assumes a homogeneous distribution of matter . for @xmath109 , which is considered to be the best model for dark energy @xcite , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , and hence @xmath10 ,",
    "are all independent of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this independence can yield a valid solution to the field equations that is consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ e : eos1 ] ) and ( [ e : eos2 ] ) describing ordinary matter .",
    "in particular , if @xmath112 , then @xmath113 under fairly general conditions .",
    "the purpose of this section is to study conditions under which a combined model of quintessential and ordinary matter may be sufficient without the electric field @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath25 is eliminated , then the assumption of zero tidal forces becomes too restrictive .",
    "so we assume that @xmath59 for some nonzero constant @xmath60 .",
    "this , in turn , means that @xmath114 now eq . ( [ e : diffequ ] ) yields @xmath115 both @xmath116 and @xmath117 are positive integration constants .",
    "( the reason that @xmath117 has to be positive is that @xmath54 is close to zero whenever @xmath19 is close to @xmath118 ) ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 now become ( for @xmath119 ) @xmath120/(m+1 ) }     { \\frac{\\eta}{4}+ \\frac{1}{2}+ [ \\frac{1}{2}(3w_q+1)m+n]/(m+1)}\\ ] ] and @xmath121/(m+1)}.\\ ] ] the last two equations are similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , which deals with galactic rotation curves .    as noted in sec .",
    "[ s : model ] , the shape function @xmath10 is obtained from @xmath122 , so that @xmath123 to meet the condition @xmath12 , we must have @xmath124 solving for @xmath125 , we obtain the radius of the throat : @xmath126 since @xmath127 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 must have opposite signs . from @xmath128 , we have @xmath129 and , after substituting eq .",
    "( [ e : rzero ] ) , @xmath130 which simplifies to @xmath131 .",
    "it follows immediately that if @xmath132 , then @xmath133 , so that the flare - out condition can not be met . to get a value for @xmath54 between 0 and 1 , the exponent @xmath60 in the redshift function , eq .",
    "( [ e : redshift ] ) , has to be negative and sufficiently large in absolute value .",
    "such a value will cause @xmath53 to be negative , which can best be seen from a simple numerical example : for convenience , let us choose @xmath109 , the lower end of the quintessence range , and @xmath134 .",
    "then we must have @xmath135 .",
    "the result is a large positive numerator in eq .",
    "( [ e:2alpha ] ) because the last term is positive and @xmath136 is large .",
    "so @xmath53 and @xmath54 have opposite signs , as expected .",
    "( observe that for the isotropic case , if @xmath109 , then the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are independent of @xmath110 and @xmath111 . )    continuing the numerical example , if we let @xmath137 and @xmath138 , then @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 from eq .",
    "( [ e : rzero ] ) , @xmath142 , while @xmath143 .",
    "as we have seen , @xmath144 is independent of @xmath117 .",
    "so we are free to choose a smaller value in eq .",
    "( [ e : rzero ] ) to obtain a larger throat size .",
    "we conclude that we can readily find an interior wormhole solution around @xmath13 without @xmath25 , provided that we are willing to choose a sufficiently large ( and negative ) value for @xmath60 , resulting in what may be called an unpalatable shape function : @xmath145 . at the throat , @xmath146 , which indicates the presence of an enormous radial tidal force , even for large throat sizes .",
    "( recall that from ref .",
    "@xcite , to meet the tidal constraint , we must have roughly @xmath147 . )",
    "such a wormhole would not be suitable for a humanoid traveler , but it may still be useful for sending probes or for transmitting signals .",
    "the enormous tidal force is actually comparable to that of a solar - mass black hole of radius 2.9 km near the event horizon , making the solution physically plausible : since we have complete control over @xmath144 and @xmath125 , we are not only able to satisfy the flare - out condition but we can place the throat wherever we wish . moreover , the assumption @xmath109 is equivalent to einstein s cosmological constant , the best model for dark energy @xcite . as noted at the end of sec . 4 , also physically desirable in a cosmological setting is the assumption of isotropic pressure , i.e. , @xmath39 in the respective equations of state .",
    "as we have seen , in the isotropic case our conclusions are independent of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "so by placing the throat just outside the event horizon of a suitable black hole , it is possible in principle to construct a  transmission station \" for transmitting signals to a distant advanced civilization and , conversely , receiving them .",
    "if such a wormhole were to exist , it would be indistinguishable from a black hole at a distance .",
    "this suggests a possibility in the opposite direction : a black hole could conceivably be a wormhole fitting our description .",
    "the easiest way to test this hypothesis is to listen for signals , artificial or natural , emanating from a ( presumptive ) black hole .",
    "this paper discusses a class of wormholes supported by a combined model consisting of quintessential matter and ordinary matter , first in einstein - maxwell gravity and then in einstein gravity , that is , in the absence of an electric field . to obtain an exact solution , it was necessary to assume that the redshift function has the form @xmath148 for some constant @xmath60 . in the einstein - maxwell case ,",
    "this constant could be taken as zero , thereby producing a zero - tidal - force solution , which , in turn , would make the wormhole traversable for humanoid travelers . without the electric field",
    "@xmath25 , the exponent @xmath60 has to be nonzero and leads to a less desirable solution with large tidal forces . concerning the exact solution , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the existence of an exact solution implies the existence of a large set of additional solutions , suggesting that wormholes of the type discussed in this paper could occur naturally .",
