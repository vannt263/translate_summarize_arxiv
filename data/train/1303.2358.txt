    "fractional calculus has been known since the early 17th century @xcite .",
    "it has been extensively applied in many fields , with an overwhelming growth of applications during the last three decades .",
    "examples abound in physics @xcite , engineering @xcite , mathematical biology @xcite , finance @xcite , life sciences @xcite , and optimal control @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in many applications , approaches based on fractional derivatives establish far superior models of engineering systems than the approaches based on ordinary derivatives @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , there is no field that has remained untouched by fractional derivatives .",
    "historically , the lack of a physical interpretation of fractional derivatives has been acknowledged at the first international conference on the fractional calculus in new haven ( usa ) , in 1974 , by including it in the list of open problems @xcite .",
    "the question was not answered , and therefore repeated at the subsequent conferences at the university of strathclyde ( uk ) in 1984 @xcite and at the nihon university ( tokyo , japan ) in 1989 @xcite .",
    "the round - table discussion at the conference on transform methods and special functions in varna ( 1996 ) showed that the problem was still unsolved @xcite .",
    "since then , the geometric and physical interpretation of fractional derivatives has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "an interesting physical discussion about initial conditions of fractional order systems is reported in @xcite , and their role in control theory is addressed in @xcite for caputo fractional derivatives , and in @xcite for riemann  liouville fractional derivatives .",
    "relation between fractional integrals and derivatives and fractal geometry , showing that for some complex systems substitution of integer - order derivatives by fractional ones results in more accurate and superior models , has received special attention @xcite .",
    "chaos is an interesting phenomenon in nonlinear dynamical systems that has been developed and thoroughly studied over the past two decades .",
    "the reader interested in applications of chaos in medicine and biology , where fractional calculus has initiated its success and activity in engineering applications , is referred to @xcite .",
    "a chaotic system is a nonlinear deterministic system that displays complex , noisy - like and unpredictable behavior . the sensitive dependence on the initial conditions , and the system parameter variation , is a prominent characteristic of chaotic behavior .",
    "here we consider a fractional order chaotic system .",
    "the corresponding integer - order system has a chaotic behavior for a wide range of parameters .",
    "such integer - order dynamical system is a reduced model for a physical system .",
    "when such system is implemented using physical electronic devices , the environment effects ( aging of the elements , temperature , inaccurate values , and so on ) on the elements appear as a different behavior so that the response predicted by the model does not resemble the actual system .",
    "indeed , for such chaotic systems the super sensitivity of the values of the elements to tiny changes , can not be considered in the dynamical equations .",
    "the main reason is related to the fractal or holed basin of the invariant set of the system .",
    "in other words , some trace of the system trajectories are seen in the observed coordinate ( phase plane ) and some of them lie in the unseen region that can not be handled by the classical nonlinear ode model . for this reason ,",
    "the fractional order system is more appropriate than the classical one @xcite .",
    "this happens to be a frequent situation : for most physical systems which exhibit chaotic behavior , the invariant set is not an integer - order dimensional object , and the basin of the trajectories in the phase space is a strange attractor field whose lyapunov dimensions are non - integer . the fractional order operators allow to describe the observed behavior by an appropriate kernel in the integral .",
    "this kernel can be treated as a weighting factor that generates a new response using existing vector fields .",
    "the study of fractional order dynamical systems has attracted an increasing attention in recent years due to their great promise as a valuable tool in the modeling of many phenomena @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "real world processes generally or most likely are fractional order systems @xcite .",
    "it has been found that fractional order systems possess memory and display more sophisticated dynamics when compared to their integer order counterparts , which is of great significance in secure communications . on the other hand , due to their potential applications in laser physics , chemical reactors , secure",
    "communications and economics , a new direction of chaos research has emerged in the past two decades to address the more challenging problem of chaos synchronization and control @xcite .",
    "recent papers study the control and synchronization of chaotic systems in both integer and fractional order cases , applying various control methodologies : nonlinear control @xcite , adaptive control @xcite , robust control @xcite , fuzzy control @xcite , and active control @xcite .",
    "the main problem in applying such control methodologies for taming chaos is often their complexity in implementation . in this paper",
    "we propose a simple linear control mechanism , based on the well - known routh  hurwitz stability criterion , for a fractional order dynamical system .",
    "the system shows very rich nonlinear dynamics , including chaos and period doubling bifurcations .",
    "a controller is proposed , and both analysis and design are studied .",
    "we show that a single input can control the very complex system .",
    "this makes our results simpler than the conventional nonlinear methods available in the literature and more feasible to implement .",
    "the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] briefly presents the necessary fractional calculus background . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we recall the stability criteria that are used in our subsequent analysis and design .",
    "description of an interesting system is presented in section  [ sec:4 ] , while the new results are given in section  [ sec:5 ] , where we illustrate our control methodology for taming the fractional order chaotic system corresponding to the one of section  [ sec:4 ] .",
