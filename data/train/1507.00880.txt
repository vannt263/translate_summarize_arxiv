    "fourier knots are closed embedded curves whose coordinate functions are finite fourier sums .",
    "lissajous knots ( defined in @xcite ) are the simplest examples : each coordinate function consists in only one term .",
    "lissajous knots are fourier knots of type ( 1,1,1 ) ( cf . for example",
    "@xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "+ surprisingly - at least at first sight - not every isotopy class of knots can be represented by lissajous knots .",
    "indeed lissajous knots are isotopic to their mirror image ; in particular a nontrivial torus knot can not be isotopic to a lissajous knot .",
    "let us first recall how to construct knots from a knot shadow .",
    "a knot shadow is a generic projection of a knot on a plane .",
    "it is a closed planar curve with nodes , i.e. double points .",
    "conversely given a shadow - i.e. an oriented planar closed curve with double points : @xmath2 we can construct a knot in @xmath0 by defining a height function @xmath3 which has the right values at each node of the shadow .",
    "the knot is then defined by : @xmath4 thus a lissajous knot projects onto a lissajous shadow ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are cosine functions ) .",
    "although we can not represent any knot by a lissajous knot , still any knot @xmath7 is isotopic to a knot which projects onto a lissajous shadow ( @xcite ) . in other words",
    "one can choose @xmath8 to be a lissajous shadow but one can not always choose * @xmath9 * as the height function . however , this is possible if the height function @xmath10 is a fourier sum of a non prescribed finite number of terms ( cf . for instance @xcite ) .",
    "+ it was conjectured in @xcite that any knot can be presented by a lissajous diagram with a height function consisting of a fourier sum with a fixed number of terms or even , as it was suggested experimentally in @xcite , with a height function consisting of only two terms : namely    [ lissajous ] any knot in @xmath0 is isotopic to a fourier knot of type ( 1,1,2 ) .",
    "the technique of the proof of theorem [ lissajous ] is inspired by a paper of @xcite and uses kronecker s theorem .",
    "another key property of number theory that will also be used is related to the fact that the only rational values of @xmath11- for integers @xmath12 and @xmath13- are only @xmath14 .",
    "+ the main idea goes as follows : given a knot @xmath7 in a given isotopy class of knots , we show that it can be presented by a lissajous diagram with prime frequencies .",
    "we then deform the shadow so that nodes are in  general position \" , i.e. their parameters are rationally linearly independent .",
    "this will be derived from the fact that the nodal curve of the deformation is skewed in the parameter space of all nodes .",
    "we then find an integer @xmath15 and real number @xmath16 -small- such that the height function @xmath17 $ ] has the right intersection signs for every two values of the parameter @xmath18 corresponding to a node of the lissajous shadow .",
    "the height function then defines a third coordinate function which together with the deformed lissajous shadow coordinates defines a curve of @xmath0 in the given isotopy class .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 and 3 we fix notations and terminology .",
    "we compute the node parameters of deformations of lissajous planar curves in section 4 ; we also show that any knot admits a lissajous diagram with prime frequencies .",
    "+ in section 5 , we show that the nodal curves of our deformations are skewed : for an appropriate choice of deformation parameters and a simple choice of phases , we can compute the determinant of the @xmath19-th derivatives @xmath20 of the nodal curve position vector in @xmath21 and show that it is not zero . in section [ sub3 ] ,",
    "the determinant is expressed as a product of factors , each of which is proved to be different from zero .",
    "we also show that the skewness of the nodal curve implies that nodes parameters of the diagram are rationally linear independent for a dense subset of the deformation parameter .",
    "the last section is devoted to the proof of the theorem : kronecker s theorem applied to @xmath22-linear independence of nodal coordinates allows us to choose , as height function of any knot represented by an appropriate lissajous shadow , a cosine function with appropriate frequency .",
    "+ _ acknowledgement _ : the starting point of this paper was a fruitful meeting with p - v koseleff whom we thank heartfully .",

    "in fact the knot thus obtained is entirely defined by curve @xmath25 and the data @xmath39 for each node . in other words a knot is defined by a shadow @xmath8 and a height function @xmath10 , where each node of @xmath8 is parametrized by a pair of real numbers @xmath37 such that @xmath40 and the sign of @xmath41 defines which strand of @xmath42 lies above which one at a crossing point - or node- of @xmath25 .",
