    "recently , a renewed interest in the study of quantum phase transitions in atomic nuclei has emerged @xcite . a new class of symmetries that applies to systems localized at the critical points has been proposed . in particular , the `` critical symmetry ''",
    "@xmath4 @xcite has been suggested to describe critical points in the phase transition from spherical to @xmath5-unstable shapes while @xmath6 @xcite is designed to describe systems lying at the critical point in the transition from spherical to axially deformed systems .",
    "these are based originally on particular solutions of the bohr - mottelson differential equations , but are usually applied in the context of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite , since the latter provides a simple but detailed framework in which first and second order phase transitions can be studied . in the ibm language , the symmetry @xmath4 corresponds to the critical point between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 symmetry limits , while the @xmath6 symmetry should describe the phase transition region between the @xmath7 and the @xmath9 dynamical symmetries , although the connection is not a rigorous one .",
    "very recently the @xmath8 limit itself has also been proposed to correspond to a critical point @xcite .",
    "usually , the ibm analyses of phase transitions have been carried out using schematic hamiltonians in which the transition from one phase to the other is governed by a single parameter .",
    "it is thus necessary to see how much these predictions vary when a more general hamiltonian is used .",
    "the global approach was first used by castaos _",
    "et al _ for the study of series of isotopes @xcite .",
    "an alternative procedure is provided by the use of the consistent q formalism ( cqf ) @xcite . in this case , although the hamiltonian is simpler than the general one , the main ingredients are included . within this scheme",
    "a whole isotope chain is described in terms of few parameters that change smoothly from one isotope to the next .",
    "because of the possible non - uniqueness of such nucleus by nucleus fits and the restricted parameter space , it is important to study under what circumstances the prediction of the location of critical points in a phase transition is robust . in this paper we follow refs .  @xcite and use a more general one and two  body ibm hamiltonian to obtain the model parameters from a fit to energy levels of chains of isotopes . in this way a set of fixed parameters , with the exception of one that varies from isotope to isotope , is obtained for each isotope chain and the transition phase can be studied in the general model space .",
    "the fit to a large data set in many nuclei diminishes the uncertainties in the parameter determination .",
    "a possible problem arising from working with such a general hamiltonian , however , is the difficulty in determining the position of the critical points .",
    "fortunately , the methods of catastrophe theory @xcite allow the definition of the essential parameters needed to classify the shape and stability of the energy surface @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze diverse spectroscopic properties of several isotope chains in the rare - earth region , in which shape transition from spherical to deformed shapes is observed .",
    "we combine this study with a coherent - state analysis and with catastrophe theory in order to localize the critical points and test the @xmath6 predictions .",
    "since the introduction of the @xmath4 and @xmath6 symmetries , only a small number of candidates @xcite have been proposed as possible realizations of such critical point symmetries . in this paper",
    "we show that the critical points can be clearly identified by means of a general theoretical approach @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec - ibm ]",
    "we present the ibm hamiltonian used . in section",
    "[ sec - fits ] the results of the fits made for the different isotope chains are presented .",
    "comparisons of the theoretical results with the experimental data for excitation energies , e2 transition rates and two - neutron separation energies are shown . in section [ sec - surf ] the intrinsic state formalism is used to generate the energy surfaces produced by the parameters obtained in the preceding section .",
    "in addition , the location of the critical point in the shape transition for each isotope chain is identified by using catastrophe theory . also in this section",
    ", the alternative description provided by the cqf for the rare - earth region is briefly discussed .",
    "finally , section [ sec - conclu ] is devoted to summarize and to present our conclusions .",
    "in this work we use the interacting boson model ( ibm ) to study in a systematic way the properties of the low - lying nuclear collective states in several even  even isotope chains in the rare - earth region .",
    "the building blocks of the model are bosons with angular momentum @xmath10 ( @xmath11 bosons ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 bosons ) .",
    "the dynamical algebra of the model is @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , every dynamical operator , such as the hamiltonian or the transition operators , can be written in terms of the generators of the latter algebra .",
    "usually some restrictions are imposed on these operators , _",
    "e.g. _  the hamiltonian should be number conserving and rotational invariant , and in most cases it only includes up to two - body terms .",
    "the most general ( including up to two  body terms ) ibm hamiltonian , using the multipolar form , can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the total boson number operator , and the @xmath13 boson number operator , respectively and @xmath18 the symbol @xmath19 stands for the scalar product , defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 corresponds to the @xmath22 component of the operator @xmath23 .",
    "the operator @xmath24 ( where @xmath5 refers to @xmath11 and @xmath13 bosons ) is introduced to ensure the correct tensorial character under spatial rotations .",
    "the first two terms in the hamiltonian do not affect the spectra but only the binding energy .",
    "therefore they can be removed from the hamiltonian if only the excitation spectrum of the system is of interest . however , a complete description of both excitation and binding energies requires the use of the full hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "the electromagnetic transitions can also be analyzed in the framework of the ibm .",
    "in particular , in this work we will focus on @xmath25 transitions .",
    "the most general @xmath25 transition operator including up to one body terms can be written as @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the boson effective charge and @xmath28 is a structure parameter .",
    "two - neutron separation energies ( s@xmath29 ) are also studied in the present work .",
    "this observable is defined as the difference in binding energy between an even - even isotope and the preceding even - even one , @xmath30 where @xmath31 corresponds to the total number of valence bosons .",
    "note that if only the first two terms in ( [ ham1 ] ) are considered and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are assumed to be constant along the isotope chain , s@xmath29 would be given by @xmath34 for a detailed study of this property we refer to ref .",
    "in this section we analyze several isotope chains belonging to the rare - earth region using the most general ibm hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) , and @xmath25 transition operator , eq .",
    "( [ te2 ] ) . as an _ ansazt _ for each chain of isotopes we will assume a single hamiltonian , and a single @xmath25 transition operator .",
    "all parameters in these operators are kept fixed for a given isotope chain , except for the single particle energy which is allowed to vary slightly from isotope to isotope .",
    "the way of fixing the best set of parameters in the hamiltonian is to carry out a least - square fit procedure of the excitation energies of selected states ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) and the two neutron separation energies of all isotopes in each isotopic chain . once the parameters in the hamiltonian are obtained , the @xmath45 transition probabilities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 of the set of isotopes are used to fix @xmath27 and @xmath28 by carrying out a least - square fit .",
    "the experimental data for excitation and binding energies and b(e2 ) s have been taken from refs .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that in ref .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian parameters were fixed just using the data for excitation energies and then @xmath52 and @xmath53 were adjusted to reproduce the experimental values of s@xmath29 . in this paper , since we are particularly interested in accurately describing the spectroscopic data associated to shape transitions , both , excitation and binding energies , are treated on an equal footing describing the shape transition , to determine the set of hamiltonian parameters in eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "tables [ tab - ham0 ] and [ tab - ham ] summarize the parameters obtained for the hamiltonian and @xmath25 transition operator for each isotope chain .    in figures",
    "[ fig - ener - nd ] , [ fig - ener - sm ] , [ fig - ener - gd ] , and [ fig - ener - dy ] the systematics of experimental and calculated energies for the states included in the least - square procedure are presented in order to show the goodness of the fitting procedure . in figures",
    "[ fig - be2-nd ] , [ fig - be2-sm ] , [ fig - be2-gd ] , and [ fig - be2-dy ] the systematics of the experimental and calculated @xmath45 values are compared .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig - s2n ] the experimental and calculated s@xmath29 values are shown .",
    "this is a fundamental magnitude for identifying a phase transition since it is directly related to the derivative of the energy surface .",
    "first order phase transitions are related with the appearance of a kink in the s@xmath29 values . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2n ] , the calculation matches the experimentally observed behavior .",
    "the analysis of the preceding figures for different observables and for several isotope chains shows that the present procedure is appropriate for systematic studies and confirms that it provides a simple framework to describe long chains of isotopes and detect possible phase transitions .",
    "an alternative approach to describe long chains of rare - earth nuclei is to use the cqf .",
    "the cqf hamiltonian is @xmath54 with @xmath55 for each nucleus the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath28 are determined in order to fit the excitation energies and b(e2 ) s . in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite the parameters of the hamiltonian are calculated within the cqf framework with the _ ansazt _ that the strength of the quadrupole term of the hamiltonian remains constant along a wide region of the mass table . as in the present paper",
    "they compare experimental data and theoretical values for excitation energies and @xmath45 transition rates .",
    "both methods provide a consistent description of the rare - earth region with a similar number of parameters as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig - spect-152sm ] and in table [ tab - be2 - 152sm ] where the case of @xmath58sm is analyzed .",
    "note that in the present work the results come from a global analysis , therefore the @xmath45 transition rates are not normalized to the transition @xmath59 in a particular isotope . if in table [ tab - be2 - 152sm ] the results are normalized so as to reproduce the observed value for @xmath60 in @xmath58sm the results of this work and cqf are basically the same .",
    "the study of phase transitions in the ibm requires the use of the so called intrinsic - state formalism @xcite , although other approaches can be used @xcite .",
    "this formalism is very useful to discuss phase transitions in finite systems because it provides a description of the behavior of a macroscopic system up to @xmath61 effects . to define the intrinsic , or coherent , state",
    "it is assumed that the dynamical behavior of the system can be described in terms of independent bosons ( `` dressed bosons '' ) moving in an average field @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the system is a condensate , @xmath62 , of bosons occupying the lowest  energy phonon state , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath5 are variational parameters related with the shape variables in the geometrical collective model .",
    "the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the intrinsic state ( [ gs ] ) provides the energy surface of the system , @xmath66 . the energy surface in terms of the parameters of the hamiltonian",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) and the shape variables can be readily obtained @xcite , @xmath67,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the terms which do not depend on @xmath65 and/or @xmath5 ( corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) ) have not been included .",
    "the equilibrium values of the variational parameters @xmath65 and @xmath5 are obtained by minimization of the ground state energy @xmath68 . as mentioned above these parameters",
    "are related to the parameters of the geometrical collective model and provide an image of the nuclear shape for a given ibm hamiltonian .",
    "a spherical nucleus has a minimum in the energy surface at @xmath69 , while for a deformed one the energy surface has a minimum at a finite value of @xmath65 and @xmath70 ( prolate nucleus ) or @xmath71 ( oblate nucleus ) .",
    "finally , a @xmath5-unstable nucleus corresponds to the case in which the energy surface has a minimum at a particular value of @xmath65 and is independent of the value of @xmath5 .",
    "the equilibrium values of @xmath65 and @xmath5 are the order parameters to study the phase transition of the system , although in the case under consideration ( ibm-1 ) only @xmath65 has to be taken into account , since the minima in @xmath5 are well defined .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - ener ] the energy surfaces for the isotopes of the different isotope chains studied in this paper are plotted as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "the figure on the right is a zoom of the region close to @xmath69 .",
    "the classification of phase transitions that we follow in this paper and that is followed traditionally in the ibm is the ehrenfest classification @xcite . in this context",
    ", the origin of a phase transition resides in the way the energy surface ( their minima positions ) is changing as a function of the control parameter that , in this work , is a combination of parameters of the hamiltonian ( see eq .  ( [ r - line ] ) ) .",
    "first order phase transitions appear when there exists a discontinuity in the first derivative of the energy with respect to the control parameter .",
    "this discontinuity appears when two degenerate minima exist in the energy surface for two values of the order parameter @xmath65 .",
    "second order phase transitions appear when the second derivative of the energy with respect to the control parameter displays a discontinuity .",
    "this happens when the energy surface presents a single minimum for @xmath69 and the surface satisfies the condition @xmath72 .    with the introduction of the @xmath4 and @xmath6 symmetries to describe phase transitional behavior , diverse attempts to identify nuclei that could be located at the critical points",
    "have been made .",
    "the theoretical approaches have been mainly performed with restricted ibm hamiltonians . in particular , within the cqf , or other restricted hamiltonians , the location of the critical point is obtained by imposing @xmath73 at @xmath69 , where @xmath74 is the energy surface @xcite .",
    "this condition leads to a flat surface in a region of small values of @xmath65 , with a single minimum in the limit @xmath75 and two almost degenerate minima ( one of them in @xmath69 ) in the other cases . in the cqf approximation",
    "it can be said that @xmath72 corresponds approximately to a `` very flat energy surface '' as happens for the @xmath4 and @xmath6 critical point models . following this approach both @xmath76nd and @xmath58sm",
    "have been found to be close to critical .",
    "however , when studying a transitional region in which the lighter nuclei are spherical and the heavier are well deformed , the a priori restriction of the parameter space could play a crucial role in the identification of a particular isotope as critical .",
    "it is thus important to perform a general analysis in order to check whether the predictions obtained within the cqf for those nuclei close to a critical point are robust .",
    "we present below such an analysis in the region of the rare - earths .",
    "we follow closely the approach introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite using catastrophe theory . in the next subsection",
    "the main ingredients of the theory are summarized and the relevant equations are particularized for the ibm hamiltonian written in multipolar form , eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) .      for the study of phase transitions in the ibm within the framework of catastrophe theory we already have the basic ingredients : the hamiltonian of the system , eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) , and the intrinsic state , eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) . with them , we have generated the corresponding energy surface , eq .",
    "( [ ener1 ] ) , in terms of the hamiltonian parameters and the shape variables .",
    "it is our purpose to find the values of the parameters of the hamiltonian that correspond to critical points . in principle",
    "this analysis involves the @xmath77 parameters of the hamiltonian , but a first simplification occurs since the energy surface only depends on @xmath78 parameters : @xmath79 where @xmath80 fortunately , it is possible to reduce the number of relevant ( or essential ) parameters to just two and study all phase transitions by using catastrophe theory @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details of the application of this theory to the ibm case .",
    "the idea is to analyze the energy surface and obtain all equilibrium configurations , _",
    "i.e. _  to find all the critical points of eq .",
    "( [ ener2 ] ) .",
    "first , the critical point of maximum degeneracy has to be identified . in our case",
    ", it corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "next , the bifurcation and maxwell sets are constructed @xcite .",
    "finally , the separatrix of the ibm is obtained by the union of maxwell and bifurcation sets . in general",
    "a bifurcation set , corresponding to minima , limits an area where two minima in the energy surface coexist .",
    "a second order phase transition develops when these minima become the same .",
    "the crossing of a maxwell set corresponding to minima leads to a first order phase transition .    in order to follow this scheme",
    ", one has to identify the catastrophe germ of the ibm , which is the first term in the expansion of the energy surface around the critical point of maximum degeneracy that can not be canceled by an arbitrary selection of parameters . in our case",
    ", one finds that the first derivative in @xmath69 is always @xmath81 because of the critical character of the point for any value of the parameters .",
    "the second and third derivatives can also be canceled with an appropriate selection of parameters .",
    "however , if one imposes the cancellation of the fourth derivative , the energy becomes a constant for any value of @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the catastrophe germ is @xmath82 and the number of essential parameters is equal to two , which can be defined , following reference @xcite , as @xmath83    @xmath84    where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are defined in ( [ coeff ] ) .",
    "the denominator in both expressions fixes the energy scale , which means that when it becomes negative , the energy surfaces are inverted .",
    "the essential parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 can also be written in terms of the parameters appearing in ( [ ham1 ] ) as , @xmath91    @xmath92    a property of the parametrization used in this work is that the different chains of isotopes are located on a straight line that crosses the point corresponding to the @xmath7 limit .",
    "the equation of this line is given by @xmath93    it should be remarked that the derivation of the essential parameters has nothing to do with catastrophe theory .",
    "the application of this theory begins once those parameters are obtained .",
    "the basic point is to translate every set of hamiltonian parameters to the plane formed by the essential parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this plane is divided into several sectors by the bifurcation set , that form the geometrical place in the parameter space where @xmath94 for a critical value of @xmath65 , and the maxwell sets , the geometrical place in the space of parameters where two or more critical points are degenerate @xcite .",
    "both sets form the separatrix of the system , in this case of the ibm . in ref .",

    "the half plane with @xmath102 corresponds to prolate nuclei , while the one with @xmath103 corresponds to oblate nuclei .",
    "note that expressions ( [ r1p ] ) and ( [ r2p ] ) are only valid for prolate nuclei , but can be readily obtained for the oblate case . on this figure",
    "the symmetry limits and the correspondence with casten s triangle @xcite are also represented . for completeness one",
    "should consider the case where the denominator of ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) is negative .",

    "a set of parameters in the hamiltonian corresponds to a point in the separatrix plane .",
    "the location of the point in that plane provides the required information on its transitional phase character .",
    "as mentioned above , it follows that points located on a separatrix line correspond to critical points .",
    "note that the dynamical behavior of the system is controlled by the lowest minimum in the energy surface . in this sense",
    "we are adopting the maxwell convention in the catastrophe theory language @xcite and the only relevant branches of the separatrix are @xmath99 and @xmath95 with @xmath104 .",
    "all these branches correspond to first order phase transitions except for the single point @xmath105 that corresponds to a second order phase transition .",
    "the rest of maxwell lines do not correspond to a phase transition because they are related to maxima .",
    "the interest of the bifurcation set , corresponding to minima , arises from the fact that it defines regions where two minima exits . in the following subsection",

    "[ fig - ener ] shows that the energy surfaces for these isotopes has a minimum for @xmath118 and a maximum at @xmath69 . in figure",

    "in conclusion , from this global analysis we find that @xmath107nd , @xmath76sm , and ( less clearly ) @xmath58gd , are close to criticality .",
    "these isotopes are quite close but do not exactly coincide with previously proposed critical nuclei @xmath76nd and @xmath58sm @xcite , where the quite basic criterion was the closeness of their low - lying excitation spectra and transition intensities with the @xmath6 values .",
    "the cqf uses a simplified hamiltonian with only three parameters . for the description of transitional nuclei from the @xmath7 to",
    "the @xmath9 limits the parameters are allowed to vary nucleus by nucleus .",
    "the representation of such calculations in the separatrix plane shows that all isotopes in a chain are basically on top of the straight line connecting the @xmath7 point , @xmath119 , and the @xmath9 point , @xmath120 .",
    "note that this point corresponds strictly to the @xmath9 casimir operator .",
    "however , a more general cqf @xmath9 hamiltonian still lies very close to the latter point . in general",
    ", the same happens in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 points .",
    "this means that within this framework the exploration of only a limited area in the separatrix plane is allowed .",
    "if all isotopes in an isotopic chain are forced to be located on the line connecting the @xmath7 and @xmath9 points , it follows that one will more often find an isotope close to the ( unique ) critical point .",
    "in the calculations presented here we have seen that within the general formalism this is not always the case .",
    "for example , for dy we did not find an isotope close to a critical point .    in previous systematic studies in the rare - earth region using the cqf formalism , ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the corresponding energy surfaces were not presented .",
    "we have constructed them from the parameters given in those references and the results obtained are consistent with those given in the present work . in particular ,",
    "@xmath107nd and @xmath76sm seem to be closest to a critical point .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed chains of isotopes in the rare - earth region . in these chains nuclei evolve from spherical to deformed shapes .",
    "we have performed an analysis of the corresponding shape transitions to look for possible nuclei at or close to a critical point .",
    "we have used the more general one- and two- body ibm hamiltonian and generated energy surfaces using the coherent state formalism .",
    "we have then used catastrophe theory to classify phase transitions and to decide if a nucleus is close to criticality .",
    "the approach used to fix the hamiltonian parameters leads to a very good global agreement with the experimental data corresponding to excitation energies , b(e2 ) s and s@xmath29 values .",
    "in particular , an excellent agreement with the measured s@xmath29 values is obtained , which is considered a key observable to locate phase transitional regions .",
    "the analysis presented here is consistent with previous cqf studies in the same region . as a result",
    "we find that @xmath107nd and @xmath76sm are the best candidates to be critical , but we should remark that @xmath76nd and @xmath58sm are not far away from it .    a possible new way of defining critical nuclei is based on the `` critical symmetries '' @xmath4 or @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the properties associated with these solutions allow the identification of critical points by comparing the experimental data with characteristic energy and transition rate ratios .",
    "thus , it may be possible to decide whether a nucleus is critical by analyzing its spectrum and decay properties .",
    "a trickier question is whether a flat energy surface can be truly associated to a given nucleus with energy ratios close to @xmath6 .",
    "a clear example is @xmath58sm : in section [ sec - represent ] we have shown that according to our study the ibm energy surface of this nucleus is not so flat as expected from previous analyses , _ i.e. _ in our work it does not correspond to a critical point as suggested earlier . however , if the spectrum and transition rates are analyzed ( see figure [ fig - spect-152sm ] and table [ tab - be2 - 152sm ] ) , this nucleus reproduces reasonably well the main @xmath6 features .",
    "we note that in the general ibm framework there is no unique spectrum associated to a given potential energy surface , as implied by equations ( [ r1 ] ) an ( [ r2 ] ) .",
    "catastrophe theory constitutes a definite criterion regarding this issue , but does not provide a measurable signature in itself .",
    "it seems clear that further work is required to find experimentally identifiable features which signal criticality in an unequivocal way .",
    "we acknowledge insightful discussions with r.f .",
