    "understanding when and how the most massive galaxies in the universe formed is one of the most outstanding problems in cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "massive galaxies are predicted in cold dark matter based models of structure formation to form gradually with time through the merging of smaller systems ( e.g , .",
    "white & rees 1978 ) . while there is some evidence for this process ( e.g. , le fevre et al .",
    "2000 ; patton et al .",
    "2002 ; conselice et al .",
    "2003a , b ; bridge et al . 2007 ) , many details are still lacking . alternatively ,",
    "massive galaxies , which are mostly ellipticals in today s universe ( e.g. , conselice 2006a ) , may have formed in a very rapid collapse of gas ( e.g. , larson 1974 ) .",
    "observational evidence suggests that passively evolving massive galaxies exist at @xmath24 , as well as at even early times , @xmath25 ( e.g. , dunlop et al . 1996 ; spinrad et al . 1997 ; fontana et al . 2004 ; daddi et al . 2004",
    "; glazebrook et al . 2004 ; treu et al .",
    "2005 ; labbe et al .",
    "2005 ; papovich et al . 2006 ; grazian et al . 2006 ; kriek et al . 2006 ; lane et al . 2007 ) .",
    "these systems are a subset of the massive galaxy population at high redshift , yet their nature , and whether or not they can account for all of the most massive galaxies in today s universe is still unknown .",
    "we also do not yet know if these massive galaxies are still forming when the universe was half its current age ( at @xmath24 ) .",
    "massive galaxies are largely the test - bed for galaxy models , and therefore understanding their evolution observationally is an important test of the physics behind galaxy formation .",
    "a major part of this problem is determining when massive galaxies form .",
    "some studies claim that massive galaxies are all in place by @xmath24 ( e.g. , glazebrook et al .",
    "however , since star formation and merging activity has been seen in ellipticals from @xmath26 to @xmath24 ( stanford et al . 2004 ; lin et al .",
    "2004 ; teplitz et al .",
    "2006 ) , a definite answer remains elusive . if it were possible to date every star in nearby massive galaxies , we could in principle determine the formation epoch and time - scales of these systems by examining their individual stars .",
    "we can not however resolve all the stars in galaxies , and their integrated stellar properties , such as colours , become degenerate after about 5 gyrs ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ) .",
    "stellar ages in massive galaxies also do not necessarily correlate with the assembly of mass through , for example , merging activity ( conselice 2006b ; de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ; trujillo et al .",
    "an alternative approach towards understanding massive galaxies and their evolution is empirically measuring the number densities , morphologies , star formation rates , and stellar masses of the most massive systems at some fiducial time and to compare these to similar quantities at different times ( redshifts ) , and with models .",
    "this has however traditionally been a challenging problem since the most massive galaxies are typically very red , either due to evolved stellar populations , or by formation in dusty starbursts ( e.g. , graham & dey 1996 ) .",
    "because of the shape of the spectral energy distributions of evolved galaxies , they are identifiable at @xmath24 due to their extremely red near - infrared to optical colours . these objects are sometimes known as extremely red objects ( elston et al . 1988 ) , which sample a fraction of @xmath27 massive galaxies ( e.g. , moustakas et al . 2004 ; conselice et al .",
    "conversely if one can obtain complete redshift samples , and combine these with deep near - infrared imaging , it is possible to locate the most massive galaxies up to @xmath15 without relying on assumptions concerning their spectral energy distributions , morphologies , or star formation histories .",
    "tracing the total evolution of stellar mass through cosmic time has been attempted in several fields , including the hubble deep fields ( dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ) , the gems / combo-17 field ( borch et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the goods fields ( bundy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "recently there have also been claims for the determination of the stellar mass evolution of galaxies at @xmath28 ( dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ; fontana et al .",
    "2004 ; bundy et al . 2006",
    "; rudnick et al . 2006 ) .",
    "some of these studies claim that many massive galaxies are formed by @xmath29 , and that these systems prove to be a complication for cold dark matter models of structure formation ( e.g. , glazebrook et al .",
    "there are however several limitations to these studies .",
    "the two most important being the use of photometric redshifts , and the small field sizes used in these earlier studies .",
    "what is now needed is a large spectroscopic survey over a large area , with deep near - infrared imaging to measure accurate stellar masses of galaxies found when the universe was younger than half its current age .",
    "we provide such a study in this paper by utilising @xmath13 1.5 deg@xmath2 palomar nir imaging of the deep2 fields ( davis et al .",
    "we also go beyond previous work by utilising ancillary data on a purely mass selected sample to determine the morphologies , colours , and star formation rates of massive galaxies , and how these properties evolved down to @xmath16 .",
    "our galaxies are selected from the palomar observatory wide - field infrared survey , which is designed to determine robustly the stellar mass evolution of galaxies , and identify the most massive galaxies , at @xmath30 .",
    "previously , we have utilised spectroscopic redshifts from the deep2 redshift survey ( davis et al . 2003 ; faber et al . 2005 ) to probe the mass function down to m@xmath31 + 3 ( bundy et al .",

    "redshifts were measured through an automatic method comparing templates to data , and we only utilise those redshifts measured when two or more lines were identified , providing very secure measurements .",
    "roughly 70% of all targeted objects result in secure redshifts .",
    "most of the redshift failures are galaxies at higher redshift , @xmath54 ( steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) , where the [ oii ] @xmath553727 line leaves the optical window .",

    "( 2006 ) , and is briefly described here .",
    "the imaging consists of 63 tiles imaged in both the f606w ( v ) and f814w ( i ) bands .",
    "the 5-@xmath3 depths reached in these images are v = 26.23 ( ab ) and i = 27.52 ( ab ) for point sources , and about two magnitudes brighter for extended objects .",
    "we further utilise spitzer mips 24@xmath56 m imaging , and chandra x - ray imaging of the egs field ( nandra et al .",
    "2007 ) to determine the star forming and agn properties of our sample . the mips",
    "24@xmath56 m imaging is part of the irac team gto program ( papovich et al .",
    "our procedure was to use a catalog of 24@xmath56 m sources matched to our list of massive galaxies within 1 , and brighter than @xmath5760@xmath58jy .",
    "this ensures that the source matching is reliable , and that the mips detections are significant to @xmath59 @xmath3 confidence .",
    "we then convert these 24@xmath56 m fluxes into total infrared fluxes utilising the fact that there is a good correlation between fluxes at 15@xmath56 m and the total ir flux ( le floch et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we use various templates to convert our observed 24@xmath56 m flux into a total ir flux , from which we compute star formation rates (  4.4.2 ) .",
    "our matching procedures for these catalogs progressed in the manner described in bundy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with the k - band catalog serving as our reference .",
    "we then match the optical catalogs and spectroscopic catalogs to the k - band catalog , after correcting for astrometry by referencing all systems to 2mass stars . the mips catalogs and x - rays catalogs are likewise matched in a similar manner .",
    "we estimate photometric errors , and the k - band detection limit of each k - band image by randomly inserting fake objects of known magnitude , surface brightness profile , and size into each image , and then recovering these simulated objects with the same detection parameters used for real objects .",
    "the most basic simulations we perform are done by simply inserting objects with gaussian profiles with a fwhm of 13 to approximate the shape of slightly extended , distant galaxies .",
    "we then retrieve these objects using the same sextractor parameters used for the original galaxy detections .",
    "we use these simulated retrievals to determine the upper limit completeness of our sample , as well as constrain errors on our photometric measurements .",
    "actual galaxy profiles however have extended envelopes that could be more difficult to measure accurately than compact gaussian profiles ( e.g. , graham et al . 2005 ) .    to determine the detection and photometric fidelity of our images in more detail , we create two sets of 10,000 mock galaxies , each with an intrinsic exponential and de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "these simulated galaxies have properties which are uniformly distributed as follows : k@xmath40 band total magnitudes between 15.5 and 20.5 mag , effective radius r@xmath60 between 0.0625 and 3.75 arcsec ( equivalent to 0.5 - 30 kpc at z@xmath131 ) , and ellipticities between 0 and 0.8 .",
    "these simulated sources are placed randomly on our palomar images , and extracted in the same manner as the real source detections .",
    "we construct from these simulations detection maps that reveal the fraction of input artificial sources detected per input magnitude and input log ( re ) bin ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "as expected , galaxies with a de vaucouleurs profile , which are more centrally concentrated , are easier to detect at a given magnitude .",
    "note that the detection fractions plotted in figure  1 are independent of output magnitude and size , and are plotted based on their input parameters .",
    "we also estimated systematic errors in measuring magnitudes due to our detection method by using the same simulations ( see figure  2 ) . to do this",
    ", we compute the magnitude difference between the recovered and input sources within the input magnitude and size bin . to estimate the output magnitudes , we use exactly the same methods used to find and measure photometry of our actual galaxies .",
    "the decreased surface brightness of objects , at a given input magnitude , results in output magnitudes systematically fainter at larger effective radii .",
    "in particular , due to the larger tail of the de vaucouleurs profiles , at a given magnitude and size , the difference in magnitude is larger for the de vaucouleurs profiles than for the exponential models . at the range of sizes for our sample objects , which range from 0.3-0.7  ( trujillo et al .",
    "2007 , submitted ) , we find that the magnitude and recovery fraction are essential 100% of their simulated value .",
    "depending on the sizes of our galaxies , we could be missing as much as 0.2 mag in the recovered k - band light .",
    "we will address this in more detail in  4.2.1 .",
    "we utilise several methods to study the properties of our k - band selected , stellar mass limited sample .",
    "the outline of the procedure is described below .",
    "the first step in this process , after reducing the k - band imaging , is to create k - selected catalogs .",
    "we make these catalogs using sextractor , optimised for detection and splitting , with both topics discussed in bundy et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "we then utilise the k - band imaging , combined with the optical imaging , to compute stellar masses from which our sample is selected .",
    "we then match these massive galaxies to mips , x - ray and hubble sources from which we derive the physical features , and the evolution of these systems .      within the total k - band area of our survey ( 1.53 deg@xmath2 )",
    "we detect 61,489 sources , after removing false artifacts .",
    "most of these objects ( 92% ) are at k @xmath61 , while 68% are at k @xmath62 , and 37% are at k @xmath63 . in total",
    "there are 38,613 objects fainter than k @xmath64 in our sample . out of our total k - band population ,",
    "10,693 objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from the deep2 redshift survey ( davis et al .",
    "we supplement these by 37,644 photometric redshifts within the range @xmath65 (  3.2 ) .    because our spectroscopy is r - band selected , while our stellar masses are based on k - band detections , we are required to divided our sample into different sub - samples .",
    "we construct a `` primary sample '' consisting of those galaxies with both spectroscopic redshifts and k - band detections . by construction",
    ", these galaxies also have optical magnitudes @xmath49 .",
    "the matching between our k - band catalogue , and the deep2 catalogue was done with a 1 tolerance .",
    "this results in a very low spurious rate of 1 - 2% due to the low surface densities in both catalogues .",
    "most of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are detected in the k - band , at a rate between 65 - 90% , depending on the k - band depth . because we are interested in the most massive galaxies , which appear bright in the nir ,",
    "the present study is not biased by these non - matches .",
    "the `` secondary '' sample consists of those galaxies with photometric redshifts . within the secondary sample ,",
    "there are two kinds of photometric redshifts .",
    "the first are those systems which have optical magnitudes at @xmath49 , the limit for spectroscopy .",
    "the other types of photometric redshifts are for those galaxies which have optical magnitudes fainter than this optical limit , in which we use a different method to compute photometric redshifts (  3.2 ) .",
    "this second set includes all galaxies at @xmath66 , which have purely photometrically measured redshifts .",
    "we calculate photometric redshifts for our k - selected galaxies which do not have deep2 spectroscopy .",
    "this sample is referred to as the photometric - redshift or secondary sample .",
    "these photometric redshifts are based on the optical+near infrared imaging , in the brijk ( or brik for half the sample ) bands , and are fit in two ways , depending on the brightness of a galaxy in the optical . for galaxies that meet the spectroscopic criteria , @xmath49 , we utilise a neural network photometric redshift technique to take advantage of the vast number of secure redshifts with similar photometric data .",
    "most of the @xmath49 sources not targeted for spectroscopy should be within our redshift range of interest , at @xmath32 .",
    "the neural network fitting is done through the use of the annz ( collister & lahav 2004 ) method and code . to train the code , we use the @xmath53 redshifts in the egs , which has galaxies spanning our entire redshift range .",
    "the training of the photometric redshift fitting was in fact only done using the egs field , whose galaxies are nearly completed selected based on the magnitude limit of @xmath49 .",
    "we then use this training to calculate the photometric redshifts for galaxies with @xmath49 in all fields .",
    "the overall agreement between our photometric redshifts and our annz spectroscopic redshifts is very good using this technique , with @xmath67 out to @xmath15 .",
    "the agreement is even better for the m@xmath5 galaxies where we find @xmath68 across all of our four fields .",
    "the photometry we use for our photometric redshift measurements are done with a 2 diameter aperture .    for galaxies which are fainter than @xmath69 we utilise photometric redshifts using bayesian techniques , and the software from benitez ( 2000 ) .",
    "for an object to have a photometric redshift we require that it be detected at the 3-@xmath3 level in all optical and near - infrared ( brijk ) bands , which in the r - band reaches @xmath47 ( coil et al 2004b ) .",
    "we optimised our results , and corrected for systematics , through the comparison with spectroscopic redshifts , resulting in a redshift accuracy of @xmath70 for @xmath71 systems .",
    "these @xmath71 galaxies are however only a very small part of our sample . up to @xmath15 only 6 ( 2.6% ) of our m@xmath5 galaxies are in this regime ,",
    "while 412 @xmath9 m@xmath10 ( 9% ) of our galaxies have an @xmath45-band magnitude this faint .",
    "all of these systems are furthermore at @xmath27 . at @xmath66",
    "all of our sample galaxies are measured through the benitez ( 2000 ) method due to a lack of training redshifts .",
    "there are instances where not all galaxies are detected in the optical bands , and the way we deal with these galaxies is discussed in  4.2.1 in terms of our measured number and mass densities .",
    "one concern with utilising the deep2 spectroscopy as the prior in the annz method is that any galaxies which are actually at higher redshifts , but with @xmath49 , could contain a very incorrect redshift .",
    "this is particularly important in this paper , as we do not wish to have additional galaxies added to our sample which could produce false artifacts in the number and mass density evolution , as well as incorrect identifications of massive galaxies .",
    "we know that about 30% of galaxies with @xmath49 will be at @xmath66 ( steidel et al .",
    "these systems at @xmath66 are however nearly all fainter than @xmath72 ( reddy et al .",
    "2006 ) , and are thus not likely contaminating our massive galaxy sample , which is nearly all at @xmath73 .",
    "after our photometric redshifts were calculated , the cfht legacy survey published their own independent photometric redshifts in the egs , which are on average within @xmath74 = 0.2 of our photometric redshifts .",
    "the poorer agreement between the cfht legacy survey photometric redshifts and ours is likely due to the lack of nir data in the cfht fits , and the more restrictive priors used in the cfht photometric redshift fitting ( cf .",
    "bundy et al .",
    "2006 ) . in any case",
    ", we do not use individual photometric redshifts , and only utilise them in large ensembles , where errors due to photometric redshift mismatches can be properly accounted for .",
    "we match our k - band selected catalogs to the cfht optical data to obtain spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for all of our sources , resulting in measured brijk magnitudes . from these",
    "we compute stellar masses based on the methods and results outlined in bundy , ellis , conselice ( 2005 ) and bundy et al .",
    "stellar masses computed in this way have a long established history ( e.g. , sawicki & yee 1998 ) .",
    "about 40% of our sample do not contain j - band imaging , but the stellar masses computed do not vary significantly when the j - band data is included or excluded .",
    "all our stellar masses are furthermore normalised by the observed rest - frame k - band light , which is roughly at rest - frame @xmath75 for most galaxies .",
    "the basic mass fitting method consists of fitting a grid of model seds constructed from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ( bc03 ) stellar population synthesis models , with different star formation histories .",
    "we use an exponentially declining model to characterise the star formation history , with various ages , metallicities and dust contents included .",
    "these models are parameterised by an age , and an e - folding time for parameterising the star formation history , where sfr @xmath76 .",
    "the values of @xmath77 are randomly selected from a range between 0.01 and 10 gyr , while the age of the onset of star formation ranges from 0 to 10 gyr .",
    "the metallicity ranges from 0.0001 to 0.05 ( bc03 ) , and the dust content is parametrised by @xmath78 , the effective v - band optical depth for which we use values @xmath79 .",
    "although we vary several parameters , the resulting stellar masses from our fits do not depend strongly on the various selection criteria used to characterise the age and the metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "it is however important to realise that these parameterisations are fairly simple , and it remains possible that stellar mass from older stars is missed under brighter , younger , populations . while the majority of our systems are passively evolving older stellar populations , it is possible that up to a factor of two in stellar mass is missed in any star bursting blue systems .",
    "however , stellar masses measured through our technique are roughly the expected factor of 5 - 10 smaller than dynamical masses at @xmath24 using a sample of disk galaxies ( conselice et al .",
    "2005b ) , demonstrating their inherent reliability .",
    "we match magnitudes derived from these model star formation histories to the actual data to obtain a measurement of stellar mass using a bayesian approach .",
    "we calculate the likely stellar mass , age , and absolute magnitudes for each galaxy at all star formation histories , and determine stellar masses based on this distribution .",
    "distributions with larger ranges of stellar masses have larger resulting uncertainties .",
    "it turns out that while parameters such as the age , e - folding time , metallicity , etc .",
    "are not likely accurately fit through these calculations due to various degeneracies , the stellar mass is robust .",
    "typical errors for our stellar masses are 0.2 dex from the width of the probability distributions .",
    "there are also uncertainties from the choice of the imf .",
    "our stellar masses utilise the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , which can be converted to salpeter imf stellar masses by adding 0.25 dex",
    ". there are additional random uncertainties due to photometric errors .",
    "the resulting stellar masses thus have a total random error of 0.2 - 0.3 dex , roughly a factor of two .",
    "the details behind these mass measurements and their uncertainties is also described in papers such as brinchmann & ellis ( 2000 ) , papovich et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and bundy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "there is furthermore the issue of whether or not our stellar masses are overestimated based on using the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models .",
    "it has recently been argued by maraston ( 2005 ) and bruzual ( 2007 ) that a refined treatment of thermal - pulsating agb stars in the bc03 models results in calculated stellar masses that can be too high by a factor of a few . while we consider an uncertainty of a factor of two in our stellar masses , it is worth investigating whether or not our sample is in the regime where the effects of a different treatement of tp - agb stars in e.g. , maraston ( 2007 ) will influence our mass measurements .",
    "this has been investigated recently in maraston ( 2005 ) and bruzual ( 2007 ) who have both concluded that galaxy stellar masses computed with an improved treatment of tp - agb stars are roughly 50 - 60% lower .",
    "this problem has also been recently investigated independently by kannappan & gawiser ( 2007 ) who come to similar conclusions , but do not advocate one model over another .",
    "furthermore , the effect of tp - agb stars is less important at our rest - frame wavelengths probed than at longer wavelengths , especially in the rest - frame ir .",
    "our survey is k - selected , and the observed k - band is used as the flux in which the masses are computed .",
    "the rest - frame wavelength probed with the observed k - band ranges from 0.7@xmath56 m to 1.5@xmath56 m where the effects of tp - agb stars are minimised .",
    "the ages of our galaxies are also older than the ages where tp - agb stars have their most effect ( maraston 2005 ; bruzual 2007 ) . to test this , after our analysis was finished , we utilised the newer bruzual and charlot ( 2007 , in prep ) models , which include a new tp - agb star prescription , on our massive galaxy sample . from this",
    "we find on average a @xmath13 0.07 dex smaller stellar mass using the newer models . at most",
    ", the influence of tp - agb stars will decrease our stellar masses by 20% .",
    "the effect of this would decrease the number of galaxies within our sample , particularly those close to the m@xmath80 boundary .",
    "this systematic error is however much smaller than both the stellar mass error we assume ( 0.3 dex ) , and the cosmic variance uncertainties , and thus we conclude it is not a significant factor .",
    "our k - band selection allows us to measure the stellar masses of galaxies to @xmath81 .",
    "the stellar mass function for galaxies within these limits is discussed in bundy et al .",

    "figure  3 displays our total sample - consisting of the primary spectroscopic , and secondary photometric redshift selected galaxies combined . while the selection limit of m@xmath80 is somewhat arbitrary , it is however the mass limit in which we are reasonably completed out to @xmath82 .    figure  3a shows the k - band magnitude distribution for our sample , demonstrating that all of our sample is at @xmath83 , where we are 100% complete in k - band detections (  2.1 ; conselice et al .",

    "however , this completeness is not the same in the b - band .",
    "this needs to be accounted for as we do not include photometric redshifts measurements for galaxies which are undetected in one of our bands (  3.2 ) .",

    "the fact that such massive galaxies exist at high redshift is not completely surprising , as a large number of massive galaxies have been found at @xmath88 , albeit in much smaller fields ( glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ; saracco et al . 2005 ) .",
    "cosmic variance is an issue in these previous studies , which have areas over a factor of ten smaller than ours .",
    "this is especially a problem , even within our survey , for the most massive galaxies , which are the most clustered within the redshift ranges we examine ( e.g. , coil et al . 2004a ; foucaud et al . 2007 ) .",
    "as a result , these massive m@xmath5 galaxies are nearly completely absent in previous high redshift stellar mass studies , although a few examples exist in some previous work using smaller area fields .",
    "because any variations in number or mass densities suggest evolution , it is important to consider the various errors that can mimic real evolution in our analysis both in terms of evolution in number / mass densities , as well as for the selection of the most massive galaxy sample which we examine later in the paper . beyond random and shot noise errors ,",
    "we also consider stellar mass measurement errors , both systematic and random , as well as errors from cosmic variance when examining the evolution of galaxy number and mass densities .",
    "this includes considering in the stellar mass errors issues with photometry , both random and systematic .",
    "we also consider in our stellar mass density and number density measurements the errors produced through using photometric redshifts .",
    "we do this through monte - carlo simulations of how the stellar mass function would change given the known uncertainty on these measurements .",
    "this also gives us some idea of the eddington bias which is affecting our selection near the m@xmath127 and m@xmath127 boundary selection limits .",
    "to 120 mm        [ sample - figure ]    the random errors result from poisson statistics on the number of galaxies ( @xmath128 ) in each redshift and mass bin .",
    "we thus include a component in our error budget to account for these counting uncertainties .",
    "stellar mass uncertainties are considered in two ways .",
    "the first method uses monte - carlo simulations of mass errors to calculate how a typical 0.3 dex error can affect the measurement of number densities .",
    "this is the typical error due to mismeasuring the stellar masses for our sample ( e.g. , bundy et al .",
    "this factor of two comes from several sources , which we conclude are all contributing random errors to our mass budget .",
    "below we examine the reasoning for this , and why we do not include any systematic stellar mass uncertainties .",
    "it is first important to note that our photometry originates from sextractor , and does not use the _ imcat _ software utilised by deep2 to obtain photometry for target selection and luminosity functions ( e.g , faber et al .",
    "we investigated systematic issues in the photometry through our simulations of placing fake galaxies of known magnitude into our images , and then determining how the detected magnitude differs from the input .",
    "we found that when the completeness was high , the retrieved magnitude was almost nearly identical to the input . the completeness at @xmath129 , the faintest magnitude where our galaxies are found , is @xmath130% (  2.1 ) , and we are thus unlikely affected by a systematic photometry error .",
    "we do not include any additional systematic uncertainty into our error budget due to our detection methods .",
    "we also compare our total sextractor magauto magnitudes to magnitudes measured using 4 dimeter aperture photometry , and find a very slight change with redshift , such that we are not detecting all the light in the highest redshift galaxies using total magnitudes .",
    "this however is a very slight effect , with at most a difference of 0.03 mag which corresponds to 0.01 dex in stellar mass .",
    "again , however , this effect is less of an issue for the brightest galaxies , which are the dominate population in our sample .",
    "we conclude that the factor of two , or 0.3 dex random uncertainty in the stellar mass is a representative estimate of the uncertainties in stellar masses . to determine how a 0.3  dex random error in stellar masses can change our densities , we simulate how the mass function and number densities of our sample would change after applying this error .",
    "we do this by changing the measured stellar masses by a random amount , to within 0.3  dex , and then recalculate the number and mass densities .",
    "the difference in stellar mass and number densities between the recomputed and original values is then added to the error budget .",
    "another major source of error in our number densities originates from cosmic variance .",
    "based on the likely bias ( b ) and dark matter variance ( @xmath131 ) , it is possible to calculate the likely cosmic variance ( somerville et al .",
    "2004 ) , and to include this in our error budget .",
    "for massive galaxies with m@xmath5 , and using the volume of our survey within each redshift bin , we calculate that the galaxy variance is @xmath132 .",
    "this leads to a fractional variation of 20 - 30% for the most massive galaxies .",
    "this variance drops by a factor of three for the lower mass galaxies in our sample , rendering cosmic variance less of an issue for these systems .",
    "when we consider our four fields , which are widely separated , it reduces the estimates of our cosmic variance by a factor of two .",
    "it turns out that our computed number and mass densities ( table  2 ) are often dominated by these cosmic variance errors .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the fact that if a galaxy does not have a measured photometric redshift , it can not be included in our sample .",
    "as discussed in  3.2 , we do not measure photometric redshifts for galaxies not detected in one of our optical bands . to investigate whether we could be missing significant numbers of massive galaxies , particularly at high redshift , where we find evolution",
    ", we examine the number of galaxies which are not detected in one band , but which could be high redshift massive galaxies .",
    "first , as figure  3 shows , the k - limit for our massive galaxy sample is roughly @xmath133 for m@xmath5 galaxies at redshifts @xmath32 .",
    "there are only 16 objects in our k - selected sample that are within this k - band magnitude limit , but are not detected in the b - band , and thus do not have a measured photometric redshift .",
    "most of these galaxies are near the k - limit with @xmath134 , and none are as bright as the m@xmath5 galaxies",
    ".    these galaxies with missing optical fluxes are unlikely influencing our measured number and mass densities at @xmath85 for the following reasons .",
    "the total number of galaxies with m@xmath5 at @xmath15 is 45 .",
    "if all 16 galaxies at our k - limit without a photometric redshift were placed into this bin , it would only increase densities by 30% , not enough to account for the non - evolution we see .",
    "furthermore , a m@xmath5 galaxy with a maximum m / l ratio would still be brighter than @xmath135 at @xmath15 , and thus these 16 galaxies are not likely to be at @xmath32 with a mass m@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath136  @xmath9  m@xmath137 bin at @xmath15 contains 725 galaxies , and these 16 galaxies would contribute a neglectable amount to their number and mass densities at @xmath15 .",
    "we therefore conclude that our criteria that galaxies be detected in all optical bands to be included in our sample is a very insignificant source of uncertainty in our analysis at @xmath32 .",
    "we are however less complete for selecting galaxies within our mass ranges at @xmath138 .",
    "we correct for this by adding the number of galaxies at these higher redshifts that are likely missed .",
    "we following willmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for this process , where we consider the likely sampling based on the k and i magnitudes , and the ( i - k ) colour for systems which did not have a measured photometric redshift , and are missing a flux in one of the two other optical bands ( generally the b - band ) .",
    "we add into our number and mass densities those objects which have a optical - nir colour and magnitude in i and k similar to the distribution of real galaxies in the given stellar mass and redshift bin .",
    "this will in fact give an upper limit on the density corrections , however in reality it makes little difference to the values .",
    "one of the most basic methods for understanding the evolution of massive galaxies is determining how their number densities and integrated mass densities change as a function of redshift . in bundy",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) we examined the overall change in the number densities of massive galaxies , finding little apparent evolution when comparing mass functions .",
    "we reexamine this in more detail using our spectroscopic plus photometric redshift sample .",
    "we furthermore examine this evolution in smaller redshift bins , and explicitly state how the evolution of the mass function is occurring , or not occurring , for the most massive galaxies , and with what certainly we can make such statements",
    ".    as we are counting galaxies , as opposed to using the v@xmath139 method to calculating mass functions , we differ in our approach from bundy et al .",
    "it is important to therefore test that our methods give consistent results .",
    "we find this is the case using the published schechter functions in bundy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , derived from v@xmath139 computed mass functions , and our method of empirically determining whether there is evolution by counting actual galaxies .",
    "we find an agreement between the two methods using the bundy et al .",

    "we find slightly more galaxies using our counting method .",
    "this is due to the schechter function under - fitting the high mass end in bundy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , something that also occurs for the @xmath140 mass function fits ( see below ) .",

    "when we investigate evolution from @xmath82 to @xmath24 we find an increase of 11.2@xmath152 in number densities , and a factor of 5.5@xmath153 increase in mass densities for systems with m@xmath5 .",
    "this is also an insignificant increase , and it appears that for the most part galaxies with m@xmath5 are nearly all formed by @xmath82 . we can not however rule out a factor of 2 - 3 evolution in number densities for these galaxies , given our large uncertainties .",

    "as can be seen in figure  4 , galaxies with m@xmath5  have perhaps a surprisingly higher galaxy number and mass density at @xmath24 than at @xmath16 .",

    "furthermore , we can see this over - density , to a much lesser degree , in the number and mass densities using other mass cuts .",
    "due to the photometric selection there are more galaxies at @xmath52 with spectroscopic redshifts than at lower redshifts .",
    "this should not however create such a difference , as we are filling in the missing galaxies using photometric redshifts . to test whether this effect is due to the spectroscopic redshifts picking up at @xmath52 , we redo figure  4 using just photometric redshifts .",
    "when we do so , we obtain nearly the same result ( figure  4 ) .",
    "we also see this peak to a limited degree when only examining objects with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "another issue is whether the photometric redshifts , most of which were trained with a neural network method ( annz ) , are somehow biased towards a @xmath171 redshift .",
    "we tested this in a number of ways .",
    "first , the spike at @xmath171 for the m@xmath5 galaxies appears to be dominated by fairly low number statistics , and the peak is most obvious in field 2 .",
    "there is perhaps a slight excess in the egs , but there is no excess or peak seen in fields 3 or 4 when examining either the photometric or spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "secondly , the annz method may bias the fitted redshifts to exist at only certain values .",
    "this is likely not occurring in our sample for the following reasons .",
    "we are training our method using only the egs field , which has a spectroscopic over - density at @xmath174 , while our over - density is found at @xmath171 .",
    "when we examine the distribution of the number of m@xmath5 galaxies as a function of redshift in narrow @xmath175z = 0.005 bins , we do not find any trend or correlation between spectroscopic redshifts and photometric redshifts .",
    "that is , the locations in redshift where photometric redshifts are found are not the same as the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "an increase in number density over the @xmath26 values for massive galaxies can be seen , often to an even greater level , in the mass functions plotted in bundy et al .",

    "there are a few possibilities , beyond cosmic variance , which can explain this result .",
    "although we conclude that the following are not the causes of the excess , we investigate them to show they are unlikely playing a role .",
    "the first is that the co - moving volumes we utilise to compute densities depends strongly on cosmological parameters .",
    "the first is that if we use a cosmology without a cosmological constant , an open universe with @xmath176 , the density contrast becomes larger .",
    "in fact , only values higher than @xmath177 = 0.7 helps alleviate the problem , but no reasonable values totally erase the excess .",
    "another issue we examined is whether the measurements of stellar masses are incorrect due to using the bruzual & charlot models to compute our mass to light ratios .",
    "models , such as maraston ( 2005 ) who include a newer treatement of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars in their models , can lower computed mass to light ratios for certain populations ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "as the tp - agb stars have their most effect at an age of 1 - 2 gyr , we investigate the fitted ages of our stellar populations to see if they are near these values .",
    "the average fitted ages for galaxies at @xmath178 is roughly 4 gyr for systems with m@xmath5 , and thus it is not likely that the exclusion of tp - agb stars is influencing our mass measurements .",
    "however , fitted ages using tp - agb stars might be lower , and in this case , it still remains possible that our masses are slightly overestimated .",
    "however , this likely can not account for the entire increase , as the improved inclusion of the tp - agb stars would lover the stellar masses by only 20% (  3.3 ) .",
    "the real cause of the increase at @xmath171 is likely cosmic variance , and even surveys larger than ours will be needed to probe the very massive end of the mass function with higher certainty .",
    "investigating the structures and morphologies of galaxies is becoming recognised as one of the most important methods for understanding galaxies ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ; cassata et al .",
    "2005 ; lotz et al .",
    "since the morphologies and structures of galaxies have a direct relationship to their formation modes ( i.e. , disks , merging systems , etc ) , we study the morphological properties of our sample in some detail .",
    "the overlap of our nir imaging and the acs imaging in the egs contains 506 galaxies with stellar masses m@xmath86 @xmath126 at @xmath32 . for nearly all of these systems ,",
    "their magnitudes are bright enough such that effects due to redshifts will not affect our ability to classify these systems either by eye , or through quantitative methods ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000c ; windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ; papovich et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; taylor - mager et al .",
    "note that the following morphological and structural analyses are only within the acs coverage of the egs field .",
    "we study the structures and morphologies of our sample within the egs using two different methods .",
    "the first is a simple visual estimate of morphologies based on the appearance of our galaxies in the acs imaging .",
    "while the acs imaging of the egs field includes both f606w and f814w imaging , we only use the f814w band imaging in our structural / morphological analyses .",
    "the outline of our classification process is given in conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "basically , we place each galaxy into one of nine categories : compact , elliptical , lenticular ( s0 ) , early - type disk , late - type disk , edge - on disk , irregular , merger / peculiar , and unknown / too - faint .",
    "while classifying these galaxies by eye it became apparent that many of the early - types appear to have a slight distortion .",
    "we therefore added a sub - class of distorted ellipticals to our classifications .",
    "these classifications are very simple , and are only based on appearance .",
    "no other information , such as colour or redshift , was used to determine these types .",
    "a short explanation of these types is provided below , with the number we find in each class listed at the end of each description .",
    "1 .   ellipticals ( e ) : ellipticals are centrally concentrated galaxies with no evidence for lower surface brightness , outer structures .",
    "( 263 systems , 68 of which are classified as disturbed es ) 2 .",
    "lenticular ( s0 ) : a galaxy is classified as an s0 if it appears elliptical - like , but contained a disk - like outer structure with no evidence for spiral arms , or clumpy star forming knots , or other asymmetries .",
    "( 23 systems ) 3 .",
    "compact - a galaxy is classified as compact if its structure is resolved , but still appears compact without any substructure .",
    "it is similar to the elliptical classification in that a system must be very smooth and symmetric .",
    "a compact galaxy differs from an elliptical in that it contains no obvious features such as an extended light distribution or envelope .",
    "( 65 systems ) 4 .",
    "early - type disks : if a galaxy contains a central concentration with some evidence for lower surface brightness outer light in the form of spiral arms or a disk , it is classified as an early - type disk .",
    "( 28 systems ) 5 .",
    "late - type disks : late - type disks are galaxies that appear to have more outer low surface brightness disk light than inner concentrated light .",
    "( 18 systems ) 6 .   edge - on disks : disk systems seen edge - on and whose face - on morphology can not be determined , but is presumably an s0 or spiral .",
    "( 12 systems ) 7 .",
    "irregulars : irregulars are galaxies that appear to have no central light concentration , and a diffuse structure , sometimes with clumpy material present .",
    "( 2 systems ) 8 .",
    "peculiars : peculiars are systems that appear to be disturbed , or peculiar looking , including elongated / tailed sources .",
    "these galaxies are possibly in some phase of a merger ( conselice et al .",
    "2003a ) , and are more common at high redshifts .",
    "( 92 systems ) 9 .",
    "unknown / too - faint : if a galaxy is too faint for any reliable classification it was placed in this category . often these galaxies appear as smudges without any structure .",
    "these could be disks or ellipticals , but their extreme faintness precludes a reliable classification .",
    "( 3 systems )    we repeat our visual classifications for a fraction of our sample , finding an initial misclassification at the 5% level .",
    "we also compared our eye - ball estimates to the cas quantitative values discussed in  4.3.4 , which allowed us to identify a significant fraction of the misclassified systems ( see appendix a ) , which were then corrected to their proper morphological type .",
    "we only perform these classifications out to @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "higher redshifts in conselice et al .",
    "2007a ) , and only use the f814w band for the classifications .",
    "this presents a potential k - correction issue , as the f814w band reveals bluer light at higher redshifts .",
    "however , through tests with the f606w band at redshifts where f814w probes well into the rest - frame optial , as well as tests on classifications in the hdf and hubble ultra deep field , show that morphological typing within the f814w band gives very similar results , with at most a 5% difference between rest - frame b - band and the observed i - band at @xmath32 ( conselice et al .",
    "2005a ) .",
    "when we discuss classifications in terms of early / mid / late types , these refer to : early ( e / compact / s0 ) , mid ( sa - sb ) , late ( sc - irr ) . for the most part we find from our visual analysis that most of the @xmath32 , and m@xmath5 systems , in which we can see structure , have an early - type morphology .",
    "there is however a small , but significant , morphological diversity among the m@xmath5 galaxies .",
    "we find that over all redshifts , 69% of the m@xmath86 @xmath126 systems are early - types ( elliptical , s0 , compact ) , while 10% are disks , and 18% are peculiars .",
    "this is perhaps a surprisingly high fraction of peculiars within our sample , and suggests that some of these systems are still undergoing some type of mass assembly , possibly through merging or star formation .",
    "this however changes when we examine only the most massive systems with m@xmath5 .",
    "these galaxies are @xmath179% early - type over all redshifts , with a roughly similar number of mergers and disks making up the remainder .",
    "these results remain essentially the same to within 5% , if we consider the eddington bias bringing lower mass galaxies into our mass cuts due to observational uncertainty .",
    "this confirms and expands with a larger sample , earlier work on massive galaxies which also concluded that more massive galaxies appear to develop an early - type morphology before lower mass systems ( brinchmann & ellis 2000 ; bundy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "to 120 mm        [ sample - figure ]    in figure  5 we plot the visual estimates for how the morphological break - down for both the m@xmath86 @xmath126 and @xmath9 m@xmath10 galaxies evolves from @xmath15 to 0.1 .",
    "the @xmath26 points are based on morphologies from the rc3 catalogue , as described in conselice ( 2006a ) .",
    "the most remarkable aspect of this evolution is that the fraction of elliptical galaxies with masses greater than m@xmath80 is relatively constant out to @xmath15 , at about 70% .",
    "there is perhaps a slight increase for the @xmath9 m@xmath10 systems at @xmath180 , as seen in previous work ( bundy et al .",
    "remarkably , there seems to be a gradual trend for the remaining 30% to transition from mergers / peculiars into disks .",
    "it is interesting that such massive disk galaxies exist at these redshifts , which must have evolved into the m@xmath5 bin through star formation , or through a morphological transformation from an early - type to a spiral (  4.3.2 ) .    in summary",
    ", what we find is that the majority of massive galaxies up to @xmath15 have an early - type morphology ( see also bundy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the findings that most of these systems are already formed in terms of their stellar masses at similar epochs (  4.2 ) .",
    "however , it is clear that @xmath181% of galaxies with m@xmath5 are not early - types , which suggests that there is evolution in the massive galaxy population that can not be seen simply through the evolution in number and mass densities .",
    "the disk galaxies we see suggest that there is some star formation occurring , and the peculiars suggest that there is merger activity .",
    "we investigate both of these galaxy - types , and what they imply for the evolution of the most massive galaxies , in the next sections .      as can be seen from figure  5",
    ", there is a significant , @xmath182 , increase in the number , and relative fraction , of massive m@xmath183 disk galaxies at @xmath32 .",
    "this result is robust to morphological k - corrections (  4.3.1 ; conselice et al . 2005 ) , and shows a real increase in massive disk galaxies through time .",
    "we investigate the possible reasons for this increase in this section .",
    "as already noted , there is a gradual transition for the non - ellipticals with m@xmath5 to appear as peculiars at @xmath27 , and as disks at @xmath144 .",
    "what is likely occurring is that the higher redshift peculiars are transforming into ellipticals after they dynamically relax .",
    "this leaves the problem of why are there are significantly more disks at lower redshifts , and why the fraction of early - types does not change with redshift .",
    "that is , if the highest redshift peculiars are becoming ellipticals , we would expect the early - type fraction to increase at lower redshift , but it remains roughly constant .",
    "one possible scenario is that some of the already massive ellipticals acquire a disk through accretion of intergalactic gas , and the accretion of low - mass satellite galaxies ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "although candidates for this disk formation are seen at slightly higher redshifts both morphologically and through kinematics ( e.g. , erb et al .",
    "2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "2004 ; labbe et al . 2004 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "2005 ; forster - schreiber et al .",
    "2006 ; genzel et al .",
    "2006 ; bouche et al .",
    "2007 ) , it is unlikely that these large disks without massive bulges are formed in this manner .",
    "the rise of these massive disks are explainable by systems with disks masses m@xmath10 at @xmath27 being brought up into the m@xmath5 bin through star formation or minor mergers . as we have seen earlier , the number densities of galaxies with m@xmath5 increases slightly with time .",
    "therefore these disk galaxies were likely lower mass ( m@xmath10 ) systems , and achieved m@xmath5 status by @xmath184 through star formation or minor merger accretion activity (  5.1 ) .",
    "for structural reasons this seems like the most likely scenario , and can explain the nearly constant elliptical fraction , despite the morphological transformation of peculiars , by simply increasing the total number of @xmath126 galaxies by adding new spirals .",
    "this idea is backed up by the evolution in the number densities , and relative number fractions , of the different morphological types shown in figure  5 .",
    "the total number densities of disk galaxies at @xmath144 is higher than the number densities of peculiar galaxies at @xmath27 .",
    "this means that it is difficult for the peculiars , without significant new star formation , to produce all of the spirals seen at lower redshifts . at the same time",
    "the peculiars are decreasing in number density at @xmath185 , the densities of the ellipticals are increasing .",
    "this causal relationship is highly suggestive that these peculiars are transforming morphologically into early types by @xmath24 .",
    "after @xmath24 there are very few peculiars in the mass range @xmath9 m@xmath10 , and no further growth in the number densities of early types .",
    "another argument against a direct peculiar to spiral transition is the structures of these massive disks .",
    "the nine most massive spirals / disks in our sample are shown in figure  6 . as can be seen , these systems are often dominated by disk light , and do not appear to have particularly large bulges . some systems also appear to have rings and bars . because these spirals have such large disks and small bulges , it is unlikely that the peculiar galaxies at @xmath186 are transforming into these systems .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect the spirals to show more disturbances , or at least a large bulge formed through the merger .",
    "massive disk galaxies in previous work are also found to be largely in place in terms of sizes , morphologies , and masses by @xmath24 ( ravindranath et al .",
    "2004 ; jogee et al .",
    "2004 ; conselice et al .",
    "2005b ) , thus any evolution in disks must be gradual .",
    "an interesting future study would be to study in detail these high mass disk galaxies at @xmath187 to decipher their origin in more detail .    to 120 mm        [ sample - figure ]",
    "it is important to note that although early - types ( classified e / s0/compact ) dominate the galaxy population at both the m@xmath5 and m@xmath5 mass selection limits , these galaxies often contain evidence for morphological peculiarities .",
    "usually these are in the form of outer low surface brightness features , or multiple cores .",
    "these are most likely the result of recent past merger activity in these galaxies , either through major or minor mergers .",
    "examples of these distributed ellipticals are shown in figure  7 .",
    "a total of 68 out of 263 ( 26@xmath188% ) of the ellipticals with m@xmath5 show some internal substructure visible by eye ( figure  7 ) . as figure  8 shows",
    ", the fraction of ellipticals with these distorted structures is relatively constant over time .",
    "there is perhaps a slight increase in this fraction at lower redshifts , which if real can be accounted for by surface brightness dimming .",
    "peculiar ellipticals have been seen in other ways previously , such as through colour gradients and colour structures in ellipticals ( e.g. , menanteau et al . 2005 ; stanford et al .",
    "2004 ; teplitz et al .",
    "2006 ) , resulting from star formation and which may be related to the features seen here .",
    "these previous studies have generally found that the lower mass ellipticals contain these star formation signatures .",
    "these morphological disturbances however do not appear more common in the lower mass ellipticals , and in fact , 36% of the m@xmath5 ellipticals show this signature - a higher fraction that for the @xmath9 m@xmath10 population .",
    "if these features are formed from a merger of various types , then it would be an anti - downsizing signature , suggesting that many giant ellipticals are still forming at @xmath32 , perhaps through dry - merging .",
    "we use the cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) parameters to probe the structures of our galaxies quantitatively .",
    "the cas parameters are a non - parametric method for measuring the structures of galaxies on resolved ccd images ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "2002 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "our main purpose in using the cas system is to identify relaxed massive ellipticals , as well as any galaxies that are involved in recent merger activity .",
    "the basic idea is that galaxies have light distributions that reveal their past and present formation modes ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , well - known galaxy types in the nearby universe fall in well defined regions of the cas parameter space .",
    "we can then automatically determine the structures of galaxies and classify them according to where they fall in this space ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "for example , the selection @xmath189 locates systems which are nearly all major galaxy mergers ( conselice et al .",
    "2000b ; conselice 2003 ; hernandez - toledo et al . 2006",
    "; conselice 2006b ) ; although ` dry ' mergers will not be detected easily through this method ( hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we apply a revised cas system to our massive galaxy sample to determine their structural parameters .",
    "there are two caveats to using the hst one orbit acs imaging of these galaxies .",
    "the first is that there are morphological k - correction and surface brightness dimming effects which will change the measured parameters , such that the asymmetry and clumpiness indices will decrease ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) , and the concentration index will be less reliable ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "there is also the issue that systems at @xmath138 are viewed in their rest - frame ultraviolet using acs data , which means that there are complications when comparing their measured structures with the calibrated rest - frame optical indices for nearby galaxies .",
    "figure  9 shows the concentration / asymmetry and asymmetry / clumpiness projections of the cas plane . as can be seen in the ca plane",
    ", the early - type galaxies mostly fall into the @xmath26 calibrated early or mid - type region , and disks are found in the mid - type and late - type regions .",
    "interestingly , the distorted ( as selected by - eye ) ellipticals are significantly more asymmetric than the normal ellipticals .    to 120 mm        [ sample - figure ]    the cas approach for classifying these galaxies",
    "is roughly similar to what the visual morphologies suggest , although there are important exceptions .",
    "details of the differences between these two methods are further elaborated on in appendix  a. for the most part , galaxy types , as determined by eye , are where they are expected to be found on this diagram .",
    "one important exception is that many of the visually classified non - distorted early - types are not located in the corresponding @xmath26 part of the cas diagrams .",
    "while these systems have concentration indices similar to nearby giant ellipticals ( conselice 2003 ) , they often have higher than expected asymmetry indices .",
    "an examination of these galaxies , and the residuals from a rotation and subtraction reveals that many of these systems have internal structures , likely resulting from mergers of various forms , that can not be easily seen by eye .",
    "furthermore , the sa plane ( figure  9 ) shows an interesting pattern , such that most of our galaxies appear to deviate from the @xmath26 relation , shown by the solid line .",
    "this deviation is such that all galaxies are more asymmetric than their @xmath26 counterparts , although the slope of the relationship between asymmetry and clumpiness is similar to that found at @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that galaxies of a given morphological type , particularly the early - types , have a higher degree of bulk asymmetry in their structures .",
    "the concentration and clumpiness values , which trace to first order the stellar mass and star formation , remain similar to what we expect from samples in the nearby universe .",
    "finally , it appears that the most asymmetric systems , and those that deviate the most from the a - s relationship are the peculiar / merging systems , or those ellipticals that show some evidence for structure due to recent tidal events .",
    "this shows that our visual estimates of merging systems is borne out by this quantitative analysis .",
    "one of the great benefits of using the cas system for finding mergers is that it allows us to quantify the merger fraction and merger rate , and the number of mergers occurring in a galaxy population ( conselice et al .",
    "2003a ; conselice 2006 ) .",
    "the first observation we can derive from our cas values is the evolution of the merger fraction .",
    "we determine the merger fraction for the m@xmath5 galaxies using the criteria , outlined in conselice ( 2006 ) of ,    @xmath190    using these criteria , we determine the merger fraction for the m@xmath5 galaxies in our sample ( figure  8) . as can be seen , there is a slight increase with redshift in the merger fraction such that it increases as @xmath191 , similar to the evolution seen in lower mass galaxies ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; bridge et al .",
    "2007 ) up to @xmath24 .    by using the number densities for our systems , and the merger time - scales for our cas method",
    ", we can calculate the merger rate for our m@xmath5 galaxy sample .",
    "the number densities for our systems are taken directly from table  2 in this paper , and the time - scales for merging are derived from equation 10 in conselice ( 2006 ) , based on n - body models analysed using the cas approach . from this , we derive a merger cas time - scale of @xmath192 gyrs for a galaxy with a mass of 3@xmath193 . note that this time - scale is not the total merger time , but the time - scale in which the cas system would identify an ongoing merger .",
    "details for how this time - scale is computed are included in conselice ( 2006 ) .    the merger rate for our systems can be calculated through the merger rate equation ,    to 120 mm     to 0.4 of the merger fraction derived through the cas approach for galaxies with m@xmath5 .",
    "we find that the merger fraction as derived with the cas parameters declines as @xmath191 .",
    "also plotted is the fraction of early types which are distorted within the same mass range of m@xmath5 .",
    "note that like all of the structural and morphological plots , these data are only taken from the egs.,width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    @xmath194    where n@xmath195 is the number densities of objects , and f@xmath195 is the merger fraction .",
    "note that this is not the galaxy merger fraction , which is the fraction of galaxies merging , which is roughly double the merger fraction ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "we find that statistically the merger rate for these m@xmath5 galaxies is constant from @xmath196 , and is on average log @xmath197 .",
    "we can furthermore calculate the total number of major mergers a galaxy with a stellar mass m@xmath5 undergoes from @xmath15 to @xmath16 using equation ( 11 ) in conselice ( 2006 ) .",
    "we calculate that the average number of mergers a massive galaxy with m@xmath5 will undergo from @xmath15 to 0.4 is n@xmath198 .",
    "thus , on average a massive galaxy will undergo about one major merger from @xmath15 to @xmath199 , roughly consistent with previous results ( conselice 2006 ; bell et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "to 150 mm        [ sample - figure ]      a major question concerning high - mass galaxies is whether or not these systems have ongoing star formation at high redshifts . while it is commonly thought that massive galaxies have finished their assembly and star formation by @xmath24 , our results suggest otherwise",
    "this is not the first claim for this , as evidence has accumulated during the last few years that ellipticals , including massive ellipticals , tend to have some ongoing star formation at @xmath24 ( e.g. , stanford et al .",
    "2004 ; teplitz et al .",
    "2006 ) and even at @xmath26 ( e.g. , donas et al .",
    "star formation , as measured through blue colours , found in morphologically selected early - types , tends to be found in lower mass systems ( bundy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we therefore investigate the fraction of massive galaxies undergoing star formation during this time , and the amount of stellar mass added due to this star formation .    to 150 mm        [ sample - figure ]",
    "we begin our examination of the star forming properties of m@xmath0 galaxies by examining their location on the rest - frame b - band absolute magnitude ( m@xmath200 ) vs. rest - frame colour ( @xmath201 ) diagram ( figure  10 ) .",
    "these quantities are inferred from the observed magnitudes through model fitting , utilising the redshift and a series of k - corrections ( willmer et al .",
    "galaxies appear to separate into a red - sequence and a blue cloud in this parameter space ( e.g. , strateva et al .",

    "the evolution of galaxies on the colour - magnitude diagram has potential meaning for understanding how galaxy evolution occurs . in figure  10",

    "the dividing line between red - sequence and blue cloud galaxies is shown as the dotted line in figure  10 , taken from faber et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ;    @xmath202    we find at the highest redshift bin , @xmath203 , a significant number of massive galaxies that are not on the red - sequence . in general , the number of massive galaxies on the red - sequence increases at lower redshifts .",
    "this is also true when we plot these galaxies in terms of their morphologies , where we find that many early - type galaxies are not on the red - sequence .",
    "the quantification of the fractional evolution of galaxies on the red - sequence is displayed in figure  11 .",
    "this shows that the most massive systems with m@xmath22 generally fall in the red - sequence region at all redshifts , but with a significant number of systems in the blue cloud region at @xmath12 . as figures  10 and 11 demonstrate , the fraction of galaxies on the red - sequence , with colours redder than the value given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , increases with time at all masses . at the highest redshifts we can probe star formation , at @xmath186 , about 60% of the m@xmath22 galaxies are on the red - sequence , yet this fraction increases to 100@xmath204% by @xmath16 .",
    "galaxies with lower masses show a similar pattern , yet lower mass galaxies always have a lower fraction of galaxies on the red - sequence at all redshifts , up to @xmath15 .",
    "this also leads to a very important conclusion regarding the red - sequence and high mass galaxies .",
    "previous studies have examined the increase of the amount of stellar mass on the red - sequence , finding as much as a factor of two increase since @xmath24 ( bell et al . 2004 ; faber et al .",
    ". however , this increase is due to galaxies appearing on the red - sequence , which were previously blue , and not due to in - situ growth on the red - sequence itself .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure  11 where the massive galaxies are gradually moving onto the red - sequence with time , which can also be seen in the decline in the number of blue massive galaxies found in the universe since @xmath24 .",
    "this is not consistent with the idea that the red - sequence grows solely through the so - called ` dry mergers ' .",

    "this is consistent with the cas results presented in  4.3.5 , and previous published results ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; lin et al . 2004",
    "; bundy et al .",
    "2004 ; lotz et al . 2006 ; bridge et al .",
    "this suggests that although number and mass densities do not statistically differ from each other , by examining the mass function in narrow redshift bins as well as the star formation rate and morphologies we conclude that there is additional mass added to these systems , by as much as a factor of two increase since @xmath288 , which is largely due to merging .",
    "previously , we could not rule out no change in number densities , based only on counting galaxies .",
    "the evolution is however clearly seen in the structures of these galaxies .",
    "we also compare our stellar mass and number densities results to models from e.g. , de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on the millennium simulation ( lemson et al . 2006 ) as another approach towards understanding how well we can reproduce with simulations the evolution of these systems .",
    "the millennium run is a @xmath289cdm simulation of the universe using 10@xmath290 particles and follows the dark matter and stellar assembly of galaxies in a 500@xmath291 mpc cube .",
    "it is currently one of the most advanced simulations that are available for comparison to data , and have been used previously to trace the evolution of massive galaxies ( de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "while the @xmath55cdm model is very successful in explaining the large scale structure of the universe , there are inconsistencies when comparisons are done on the scale of galaxies . by testing this model in other ways , such as through the assembly of the most massive galaxies , we can perhaps determine the origin of some of the missing physics , or initial conditions used in these simulations .",
    "the stellar mass calculation in the millennium simulation uses the same imf as our stellar mass measurements , and are based purely on the amount of stars produced in galaxies as a function of time .",
    "the chabrier imf enters into these models through the computation of the fraction of gas in star formation which is returned to the cold gas , which in these models is 40% .",
    "there is also a prescription for which stars explode as supernova , and when , which further reduces the stellar mass , but only for the stars at the highest masses .",
    "when we compare our stellar mass number and mass densities to the millennium model , we find that they generally underestimate the number and mass densities of the most massive galaxies at @xmath20 ( figure  16 ) .",
    "the agreement for both stellar mass number and mass densities at @xmath26 is however fairly good within the uncertainties .",
    "the best agreement is between the number densities of systems with @xmath9 m@xmath86 @xmath9 .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  16 , this agreement breaks down when comparing the mass densities of these systems to the model . as there is generally a much worse agreement for the m@xmath5 systems in terms of mass densities than number densities",
    ", we can interpret these disagreements in the sense that the models do not produce enough massive galaxies early enough .",
    "this extends throughout the m@xmath5 range .",
    "clearly , the models eventually produce these massive systems , as there is agreement at @xmath26 , but they are formed in the simulation at much later times , typically at @xmath144 through mergers ( de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "this disagreement suggests that the bulk formation of massive galaxy formation occurs at @xmath25 , especially for the massive systems .",
    "this implies both an early star formation history , as well as an early mass assembly history .",
    "when comparing with observations of the merger history , it is clear that massive galaxies are formed through mergers at @xmath25 ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "it is likely that these galaxies are much more biased than what the millennium simulation assumes , and thus they must have an early merger and star formation history .    when examining the galaxy merger history ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; conselice 2006 ) , it is clear that massive galaxies do not merge much at @xmath20 , but have a high merger fraction ( @xmath292% ) at higher redshifts , @xmath25 .",
    "the millennium model produces most of the mass in these massive galaxies by @xmath82 , but they are not yet assembled in massive galaxies in the model until relatively late ( e.g. , de lucia et al .",
    "it appears that the actual merger rate for massive galaxies is much higher in the past , than what is predicted , and likewise smaller at @xmath20 than the models .    to 150 mm        [ sample - figure ]",
    "we utilise wide and deep near infrared imaging from the palomar telescope combined with deep2 spectroscopy to select and study the properties and evolution of m@xmath5 galaxies found at @xmath19 .",
    "our total sample consists of 4571 galaxies with m@xmath5 , and 225 galaxies with m@xmath5 .",
    "we investigate with deep2 spectroscopy , hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging , chandra imaging , and spitzer mips imaging : the x - ray , morphological and star forming properties of our sample .",
    "our major findings are : + 1 . the stellar mass and number densities of m@xmath5 galaxies does not change significantly at @xmath144 .",
    "we however can not rule out factors of 2 - 3 in number and mass density evolution for these systems , based solely on densities , due to uncertainties in these measurements .",
    "systems with @xmath9 m@xmath10 however show a significant increase between @xmath170 .",
    "the increase in stellar mass density for systems with m@xmath5 is however marginally insignificant over our entire redshift range up to @xmath82 .",
    "there is a diversity in the morphological properties of galaxies selected solely by stellar mass .",
    "we find that most galaxies selected with m@xmath22 are classifiable as early - types at all redshifts , with only a small fraction classified as peculiars and spirals at @xmath186 .",
    "systems with @xmath9 m@xmath10 have a lower fraction of galaxies consistent with being early - types , with a nearly constant fraction with redshift of 70% .",
    "the remaining systems tend to be classified as peculiars / mergers at high redshift , and spirals at lower redshifts .",
    "we further find that a significant number of the early - type galaxies contain a slight morphological disturbance , which is furthermore seen in the quantitative cas parameters .",
    "we find that a significant fraction ( @xmath215% ) of massive galaxies at @xmath19 are undergoing star formation .",
    "this is demonstrated through the blue colours of massive galaxies , and star formation rates as derived through spitzer mips imaging of these systems .",
    "the fraction of galaxies with m@xmath22 which are on the red - sequence is only 60% at @xmath186 , but increases to @xmath13 100% by @xmath16 . likewise , the fraction of lower mass systems , with @xmath9 m@xmath10 , which are on the red - sequence increases with time , although at every redshift there is a higher fraction of systems with m@xmath22 on the red - sequence than at lower masses .",
    "we investigate the star formation rate density for our massive galaxy sample , finding a steep decline in the star formation rate density for systems with m@xmath5 , and a more shallower decline for systems with @xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "the rate of decline in star formation for m@xmath5 systems can be parameterised as @xmath293 , as opposed to @xmath294 for systems with masses @xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "we match our catalog of massive galaxies to a catalog of x - ray sources discovered with chandra imaging in our largest field , the extended groth strip .",
    "we find that a significant fraction ( 5% ) of the most massive galaxies are x - ray emitting agn .",
    "we investigate in detail the properties of these agn and find that the most massive galaxies , with m@xmath5 , have soft hardness ratios , while the galaxies with @xmath9m@xmath10 have a mixture of hard and soft ratios .",
    "furthermore , we find that nearly half of all the massive galaxies which have agn are either distorted ellipticals or peculiars .",
    "we investigate how much stellar mass is added to galaxies due to star formation from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and compare this to the observed changes in the stellar mass density .",
    "we find to @xmath295 confidence that the star formation seen in individual massive galaxy bins at @xmath32 can not account for the changes in stellar mass seen in galaxies with m@xmath5 .",
    "we however find that the amount of mass which transfers between bins due to star formation , bringing galaxies up into higher mass bins , can within 1 @xmath3 account for this increase .",
    "the difference suggests that up to a single major merger is occurring for m@xmath5 galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "this is also found to be the case through an analysis of cas parameters , giving @xmath18 major mergers at @xmath19 .",
    "our major conclusion in this paper is that the stellar mass assembly of massive galaxies is , within a factor of two , complete by @xmath24 .",
    "there is however still significant morphological and colour evolution at @xmath144 for massive galaxies .",
    "we also find significant evolution in the number and mass densities for galaxies with m@xmath5 at @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the study of ` early - types ' , defined through colour , morphology or mass , at high redshifts must be carefully done , and results of studies will vary significantly , depending on selection .",
    "it is clear , particularly at high redshift , that red galaxies are not the equivalent of massive galaxies , or elliptical galaxies , and each of these populations must be studied individually .",
    "the palomar and deep2 surveys would not have been completed without the active help of the staff at the palomar and keck observatories .",

    "in this appendix we describe in more detail the degree of agreement between the cas and visual estimates of morphology .",
    "we are particularly interested in describing why some systems classified as a particular type by eye fall into a different region of cas space than what their apparent morphology would indicate .",
    "a more limited discussion of this issue has been presented in conselice ( 1997 ) , bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , mobasher et al . (",
    "2004 ) and conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "before we discuss why there are differences between visual estimates of morphological type and the quantitative approach , it is important to describe the process of morphological classification by eye .",
    "this process was carried out by one of us ( cjc ) by examining a galaxy s structure on a computer screen .",
    "this was done through iraf and the viewing tool ds9 , although similar results can be had through any approach that lets the viewer change the contrast .",
    "classification was done into the types described in  4.3 using the traditional approach of examining the entire galaxy at once , and judging which of the categories it belongs to .",
    "when this process is done we do not take into account the smaller , more subtle , details of a galaxy s structure .",
    "for example , although most of our sample of @xmath126 galaxies consists of ellipticals , about a third have some kind of morphological peculiarity . typically , this was either a diffuse outer envelope of material , or a lopsided centre with respect to the rest of the galaxy .",
    "this is clearly seen the cas space for these systems - the peculiar ellipticals have higher asymmetry and clumpiness values than ellipticals , compacts and s0s .    however , there are cases in which a galaxy has been classified as one type but appears in a region of the cas space where it ordinarily should not be .",
    "examples of this include ellipticals with high asymmetries , or low concentrations , and peculiar galaxies with low asymmetries .",
    "while on average these galaxy populations are found in the location expected within the cas space , there are some obvious exceptions . after creating the first version of figure  9",
    "we went back and examined by eye the @xmath296% of galaxies whose visual morphology differed greatly from their measured cas values .",
    "about half of the time it turned out that the galaxy was misclassified by eye or recorded incorrectly .",
    "this always accounted for the most obvious cases where the cas values and eye estimates of morphology differed the most .",
    "there are however systems that still differ in terms of their visual estimates of morphology and their measured cas values .",
    "it turns out that the cas parameters are most successful at distinguishing disk galaxies , ellipticals and mergers from each other ( cassatta et al .",
    "we therefore focus on these three populations .",
    "first , perhaps the most obvious disagreement is the high - a ellipticals and the low - a peculiars .",
    "the ellipticals classified by eye that contain a high asymmetry were nearly always systems that had some morphological peculiarity .",
    "in other cases , it was determined that the high - a elliptical / s0 systems were nearly edge - on , or otherwise peculiar , s0s that often contained a prominent dust lane .",
    "other examples were ellipticals that contained neighbouring galaxies that created a higher - a signal .",
    "the peculiars that are at @xmath297 show a diversity of visual morphologies . often these systems were compact and concentrated with some diffuse material , or had blob like features nearby . in many cases",
    "these systems appear to be ellipticals in assembly , and could have easily been classified as peculiar ellipticals .",
    "other examples of lower - a peculiars are systems imaged with a low - s / n . as has been argued in conselice et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and conselice ( 2003 ) a lower s / n will make it more difficult to measure quantitative indices for these systems .",
    "several systems resembled spiral galaxies , or spirals in assembly , with what appears to be arms in development .",
    "it thus appears that quantitative measures of structures are revealing information that eye - ball estimates are missing , namely that a gross morphology can be present while the galaxy structure still retains some signatures of recent formation .",
    "this creates significant differences when comparing galaxies of the same type , as selected by eye - ball estimates , at low and high redshifts ."
