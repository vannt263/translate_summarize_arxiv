    "in last years , researchers have shown an increasing interest on the conceptual development of accelerator - driven systems ( ads ) for nuclear waste transmutation and energy production purposes .",
    "an important issue regarding its future industrial applicability is the development of a periodically subcriticality level measurement and monitoring technique , since both its operation safety and its performance as a part of the nuclear fuel cycle shall be seriously affected by this variable .    following the study of the neutron fluctuations in a multiplying medium , @xcite ,",
    "several static and dynamic methods have been proposed and studied for years concerning their applicability for the determination of some nuclear reactor physics parameters ( see @xcite ) . within the group of dynamic techniques , apparently the utilisation of the neutron - fission chain fluctuations for nuclear assemblies subcriticality determination",
    "was firstly suggested by bruno rossi ( the rossi-@xmath1 method ) . in these methods",
    "neutron detector counting rates related to individual fission - chain events must be discerned from the total counting rate , therefore these methods are applicable to subcritical systems near delayed critical conditions , @xcite .",
    "further , dynamic methods based on a time - dependent external neutron source were proposed by @xcite .",
    "recently , the use of these methods has increased during the muse european experimental studies carried out at the masurca facility ( cadarache , france ) due to their applicability in order to investigate ads kinetic parameters . in these experiments",
    "d - d and d - t neutron sources running in pulsed mode have been used , although the utilisation of an external spallation proton source has also been thought .",
    "anyway , measurements can be done in two different ways ( @xcite ) : in the first one , the neutron detector time gate is synchronized with the external neutron pulse injection , thus this method is referred to as deterministic pulsing method , whereas , in the second case , the relative delay between the neutron pulse injection and the beginning of the neutron counting time is uniformly sampled between zero and the pulsed source period , which is known as stochastic pulsing method . for the latter case , the neutron source can be assumed to have the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of protons injected per proton pulse , @xmath4 is the pulsed source period , and @xmath5 is uniformly sampled within the time interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "obviously , for the deterministic pulsing method we will put @xmath7 .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite developed a general theory for the study of the stochastic neutron field .",
    "this model , complemented afterwards by @xcite , completely describe the stochastic neutron field in a fissile assembly .",
    "later , @xcite derived expressions for the variance of the number of counts in a detector and the cpsd for a poissonian source without delayed neutrons from the general neutron stochastic transport theory .",
    "these approaches permit to go beyond classical point kinetic approximations , taking into consideration general problems with spatial , spectral , and angular dependence .",
    "they have been extensively applied to nuclear subcriticality safety and non - destructive nuclear fuel assay problems .",
    "classical reactor noise methods are not correct when pulsed or correlated sources are used ( @xcite ) . for these kind of sources ,",
    "forward kolmogorov s approach is not valid because of the non - markovian character of the process , while backward green s function description needs to go beyond poissonian behaviour ( @xcite ) .    in our work",
    "we have derived a relationship between the source probability generating function and the kernel probability generating function when non - poissonian spallation neutron sources are considered .",
    "we have also studied the effect of the intrinsic neutron source due to spontaneous fission occurring in major actinides forming part of the nuclear fuel of an ads .",
    "this result can considered as a generalisation of the master equation obtained by @xcite for cross statistical descriptors ( problems with more than one detector ) .",
    "in particular , we admit the intrinsic source spontaneous fission process to behave as a poissonian one , albeit neutron emission multiplicity corresponding to spontaneous fission events has also been included .    in this paper",
    "we have neglected the contribution of delayed neutrons , therefore all quantities appearing here can be interpreted as prompt variables for short time - scales , in comparison with the delayed neutron precursors lifetimes .",
    "the derivation of the general relationship between the source pgf and the kernel pgf shall be based on two well known results ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) :    * given a random variable , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , being mutually independent discrete random variables , and @xmath11 being the probability generating function associated to @xmath9 , where @xmath12 is the probability for the occurrence of the event @xmath13 , @xmath14 , then the probability generating function of @xmath15 can be expressed as + @xmath16 * given a random variable @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 being mutually independent discrete random variables , then + @xmath21    in our system we must consider two independent sources leading to detector counts , @xcite : neutrons appearing from spontaneous fission of isotopes contained within the nuclear fuel , and neutrons coming from the spallation source induced by nuclear interactions of the proton beam with the target material .    in particular , for the derivation of the cross correlation between two neutron detectors , we shall consider the two - dimensional discrete random variable @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , is the number of neutron detections gathered by the @xmath25-th detector during the time interval @xmath26 . and according to our previous discussion , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , are the number of detections registered by the @xmath25-th detector and coming from the intrinsic spontaneous fission source and the external pulsed source , respectively ; equivalently , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    in case of the intrinsic spontaneous fissions source",
    ", the number of detector counts within the time interval @xmath32 , @xmath28 , can be expressed as    @xmath33    where @xmath20 is the number of spontaneous fission events occurring within the fuel material and @xmath34 is the number of detector counts gathered by the @xmath25-th detector corresponding to each spontaneous fission event , both being mutually independent discrete random variables , @xcite ; its corresponding two - dimensional discrete random variable will be denoted as @xmath35 .",

    "if we multiply the previous expression by @xmath69 and sum up from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , we get the relationship between the spallation source probability generating function and the kernel one for one proton randomly injected ,    @xmath72 ^{j}. \\label{pgfoneproton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used the spallation operator @xmath73 . with this expression and taking into account the relationships expressed at the beginning of this section , and admitting that the number of detector counts after the introduction of each proton belonging to the same source pulse can be considered as independent discrete random variables",

    ", we will have    @xmath78    in general , neutron detectors will register counts coming from both , spontaneous fission and spallation , sources which can be treated as mutually independent random variables ( @xcite ) , thus the probability generating function governing both processes will be given by the product of equations ( [ pgfbell ] ) and ( [ pgfspalxi ] ) , that is ,    @xmath79    this last equation expresses the relationship between the source probability generating function and the kernel probability generating function when we consider the effect of the intrinsic spontaneous fission source and the periodic pulsed spallation neutron source , @xcite . in particular , for the deterministic pulsed method we just need to choose the elapsed time @xmath80 equal to zero , whereas , in order to apply the stochastic pulsing method we will calculate the expected value of ( [ pgfxi ] ) , @xmath5 being uniformly sampled between zero and the proton pulse period , @xmath4 , i.e. ,    @xmath81",
    "in this section we derive the integro - differential equation governing the kernel probability generating function @xmath82 .",
    "first of all , we need to obtain an expression for the probability function @xmath83 for both neutron detectors .",
    "it can be done using a probability balance of mutually exclusive events ( @xcite ) .",
    "then we shall multiply the probability balance equation of @xmath84 by the factor @xmath85 and then sum up from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "next , we need to apply the known pl s methodology ( see @xcite ) to obtain the non - linear transport integro - differential equation satisfied by the kernel probability generating function , @xcite :    @xmath88    where we have defined the general time - dependent transport operator    @xmath89    and the non - linear kernel pgf source operator    @xmath90 ^{j } \\right\\ } , \\label{sgk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath91represents the probability distribution function for a neutron to exit with velocity and direction within @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , after a scattering event ( the superscript @xmath94 applies for the @xmath25-th detector volume ) with an incident neutron with velocity @xmath95 and direction @xmath96 , whereas the spectrum of neutrons emitted following a fission event is given by    @xmath97that is , as before , for the system volume no subscript is used , while to refer to fissions occurring within either detector volume we will add the subscript @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 is the maximum number of neutrons produced after a fission event .",
    "in addition , in expression ( [ sgk ] ) we must specify the c - probabilities :    @xmath100    is the probability to have zero detector counts following a capture event within the nuclear system ( @xmath101 ) or within one of the detectors ( @xmath102 , @xmath24 ) after a given neutron interaction at position @xmath45 and time @xmath44 .",

    "@xmath108 is the time window for the @xmath25-th detector , @xmath109 being the characteristic or heaviside function .",
    "similarly , for one neutron count after a capture event in the first detector , we have    @xmath110    the expression corresponding to the case of one neutron count following a neutron capture event in the second detector can be derived in an analogous way .",
    "next , in equation ( [ sgk ] ) we must also specify the probability to have zero counts in both detectors after a neutron scattering event at position @xmath45 and time @xmath44 , @xmath95 being the incident neutron velocity , i.e. ,    @xmath111    where @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) denotes the neutron scattering macroscopic cross section for the system ( @xmath25-th detector ) volume and @xmath114 is the @xmath25-th detector scattering efficiency .    in case of one detector count , for instance , in the first detector :    @xmath115    finally , in equation ( [ sgk ] ) the probability of occurrence of a fission event with emission of @xmath116 neutrons leading to zero detector counts following a neutron interaction at position @xmath45 and time @xmath44 is given by    @xmath117    where @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) accounts for the probability to emit @xmath58 neutrons after a fission event within the system ( @xmath25-th detector ) volume , @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) denotes the neutron fission macroscopic cross section for the system ( @xmath25-th detector ) volume and @xmath122 is the @xmath25-th detector fission efficiency .",
    "whereas , if we consider , e.g. , one detector count registered by the first detector ,    @xmath123    expression ( [ hgks ] ) must fulfil the final condition @xmath124 for @xmath125 , due to the causality principle , and the boundary condition @xmath126 for @xmath127 , i.e. , for neutrons injected outwardly at a convex boundary ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , according to bartlett s procedure , @xcite , we can derive the first factorial moment of the number of detector counts per single neutron injected in the system at the phase - space point @xmath128 and at time @xmath44 as    @xmath129    whereas the cross second factorial moment of the number of detector counts per single neutron injected can be defined as    @xmath130    thus , applying the operator @xmath131 to the expression corresponding to the transport integro - differential equation satisfied by @xmath132 , equation ( [ hgks ] ) , we get @xmath133 where the time - independent adjoint transport operator @xmath134 , @xcite , and    @xmath135 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\left [ h\\left ( t-\\left ( t_{{\\rm f}_{i}}-\\tau _ { { \\rm c}_{i}}\\right ) \\right ) -h\\left ( t - t_{{\\rm f}_{i}}\\right ) \\right ] . \\label{sdi+}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this magnitude will be non - zero only for @xmath45 @xmath136 @xmath102 and @xmath44 @xmath136 @xmath137 $ ]",
    ".    the solution @xmath138 of equation ( [ transportzi+ ] ) must fulfil the boundary condition @xmath139 for @xmath140 , on a convex boundary , and the time - reversed causality condition , i.e. , it must vanish at the end of the measurement period @xmath141 .",
    "indeed , equation ( [ transportzi+ ] ) reveals the nature of @xmath138 as an adjoint generalised green s function driven by the adjoint importance source @xmath142 , @xcite .",
    "consequently , for the forward transport problem we shall write    @xmath143    where @xmath144 is the time - independent direct transport operator , @xcite , and    @xmath145    that is , the total neutron source can be expressed as the sum of the intrinsic and the spallation neutron sources ,    @xmath146    @xmath147    where we assume the initial number of nuclei corresponding to the spontaneous disintegration neutron source to be constant in our time - scale ,    @xmath148    @xmath149    with @xmath150 , @xmath151 .    now , the forward neutron flux satisfies the initial condition @xmath152 , and the boundary condition @xmath153 for @xmath154 , on a convex boundary . a proper choice of the corresponding boundary and final conditions for the adjoint function makes the associated bilinear concomittance to vanish , and , hence , due to the commutation relation    @xmath155    where dirac s notation for the inner product is used , and where both terms account for the average number of detector counts during its counting interval : at the left hand side we have the inner product of the neutron source strength , @xmath156 , ( neutrons emitted at a given phase - space point and time ) and the number of counts gathered at detector @xmath25 per single neutron introduced at a given phase - space point and time , @xmath138 ; equivalently , the right hand side term expresses the inner product of the effective macroscopic neutron detection cross section for the same detector , @xmath142 , and the neutron flux , @xmath157 , @xcite .",
    "similarly , we can make use of ( [ bartlettz1z2 ] ) to find an expression for the cross second factorial moment of the number of detector counts per single neutron introduced :    @xmath158    where the importance source for the cross second factorial moment can be recast as    @xmath159    the cross second factorial moment @xmath160 must satisfy the same time - reversed and boundary conditions as @xmath138 , but for @xmath161 .",
    "hence , it can be viewed as a generalised adjoint function , now driven by the adjoint source , @xmath162 , that is , the product of the detector cross sections and the spectral and angular weighted neutron importances .",
    "again , the commutation relation leads to the identity    @xmath163    in order to express the adjoint problem in terms of instantaneous detector counting rates , we shall divide adjoint transport equations ( [ transportzi+ ] ) and ( [ transportz1z2 + ] ) by @xmath164 and @xmath165 and then calculate the limits @xmath166 and @xmath167 , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "we shall write    @xmath168    @xmath169    where , by definition ,    @xmath170    @xmath171    since , taking into account equations ( [ transportzi+dot ] ) and ( [ sdi+dot ] ) , @xmath172 can be regarded as a displacement kernel , @xcite ,    @xmath173    @xmath174    next , we look for a solution to the boltzmann neutron transport equation ( [ transportn1 ] ) for the direct flux , @xmath175 , satisfying the @xmath0-modes expansion :    @xmath176    where we assume the eigenfunctions @xmath177 to form a complete basis in the corresponding hilbert space ( @xcite )",
    ". these must obey the @xmath1-eigenvalue equation    @xmath178    similarly , for the adjoint flux instantaneous rate we will have    @xmath179    and the @xmath1-eigenvalue equation    @xmath180    beneath this ansatz , it is obvious that we must put @xmath181 .",
    "the adjoint and forward eigenfunctions satisfy the biorthogonal relation , @xcite , i.e. ,    @xmath182    where the phase - space inner product is defined by @xmath183 .",
    "if we introduce the ansatz ( [ fluxexp ] ) in equation ( [ transportn1 ] ) and apply the fourier transform operator to both sides of it , we shall obtain the fourier transform of the @xmath58-th flux instataneous rate time - dependent term , which , on account of identities ( [ alphadirect ] ) , ( [ alphaadjoint ] ) , and ( [ biortho ] ) , reads as    @xmath184 , \\label{zetj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath185    @xmath186    in the same way , from ( [ transportzi+dot ] ) we can deduce the expression corresponding to the fourier transform of the @xmath58-th adjoint flux instantaneous rate time - dependent term for the @xmath25-th neutron detector :    @xmath187    where @xmath188 is given by ( [ sdi+ ] ) .",
    "in order to obtain the analytical expressions corresponding to the factorial moments of the number of counts of both neutron detectors we can apply again bartlett s procedure ( @xcite ) to the expression corresponding to the source probability generating function .",
    "as we have outlined previously , we can do it taking into account two different situations : in the first case , we can calculate factorial moments corresponding to the deterministic pulsing method .",
    "we are interested in the well known cross covariance function , @xcite , defined as    @xmath189    where @xmath190 is given by ( [ pgfxi ] ) with @xmath191 , i.e. , it is the difference between the cross second factorial moment of the number of detector counts gathered by both detectors and the product of their first factorial moments .",
    "it can be recast as    @xmath192    where the first term takes into account the contribution coming from multiplicative processes within the system and the detector volumes due to fission events and detections .",
    "the latter can be _ de facto _ neglected if we admit that the volume occupied by detectors is small in comparison with the system volume .",
    "in addition , the second term in ( [ cov2 ] ) stems from the non - poissonian behaviour of both neutron sources .    next we can divide equation ( [ cov2 ] ) by @xmath193 and then apply the limits @xmath194 in order to derive the expression corresponding to the second order instantaneous rate of the cross covariance function :    @xmath195    where , by definition ,    @xmath196    @xmath197    with    @xmath198    @xmath199 being system diven s factor , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and where we have defined the phase - space inner product    @xmath202    and    @xmath203    which arises from the non - poissonian nature of the intrinsic and the external spallation sources , respectively ,    @xmath204    @xmath205 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\int_{-\\infty}^{t_{\\rm f } } { \\rm d}t \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\delta\\left(t - mt\\right ) \\zeta_{{\\rm d}_{1 } j}^{+}\\left(t - t_{\\rm f_{1}}\\right ) \\zeta_{{\\rm d}_{2 } k}^{+}\\left(t - t_{\\rm f_{2}}\\right ) , \\label{covdeltasf1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath206 , @xmath207 , is diven s factor for the spontaneous fission ( intrinsic ) source , the spallation neutron production source , and the pulsed proton source , respectively , with @xmath208 .",
    "furthermore , in the last two expressions we have introduced the following inner products :    @xmath209    @xmath210    without loss of generality , we can assume that the upper integral limit in ( [ cov1 ] ) can be selected in such a way that @xmath211 , and then admit that @xmath212 .",
