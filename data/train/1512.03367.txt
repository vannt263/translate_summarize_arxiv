    "the interest for one dimensional ultra cold quantum systems has grown considerably in the last few years .",
    "this is partly due to the realization of such systems in highly controllable environments using cold atomic gases  @xcite and partly due to the revelation of interesting quantum phenomena that are unique to one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "some of the fundamental 1d effects include spin - charge separation , which has been studied recently for both fermions and bosons  @xcite .",
    "the spin separation is usually caused by the well - known pauli principle for fermions , however in bose mixtures , where the bosonic system consists of two - component subsystems , the separation has also been found . in that sense ,",
    "the bosonic systems are more interesting than fermionic ones because here , in addition to inter - species interaction , one can also tune the intra - species interaction , which is the interaction between the same type of particles .",
    "the latter is clearly not an option for fermions due to the pauli principle ( when considering only @xmath0-wave interactions ) . in bose mixtures",
    "it has been shown that a ferromagnetic ground state occurs when the intra- and inter - species interactions are identical @xcite .    a particular case of bose mixtures where one single atom of one kind , usually called the impurity , interacting with a number of quantum particles of other kind , also called majority particles , is also an interesting field in 1d systems .",
    "just to mention a few studies and effects in this area one can mention the landau - pekar polaron @xcite and a magnetic impurity in a metal resulting in the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , the impurity atom interacting with a bose - einstein condensate has been found to have a bound ground state in which the impurity is self - localized in the so - called polaron - like state @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable recent interest in the physics of polarons in quasi - condensates @xcite , also in the case where the mass of the impurity is different from the mass of the bosons @xcite . in a recent study the crossover between few- and many - body behaviors in bose mixtures in the equal mass case was explored @xcite . moreover",
    ", a new method has been developed to study the general case of the many body bose polarons @xcite .",
    "studying such systems and their behavior can help to understand the physics behind some general phenomena in polaron and many - body physics .",
    "here we extend the studies done before by investigating how correlated the impurity and the majority particles are with each other .",
    "the correlation is investigated in two cases ; one as a function of interaction strength between the impurity and majority particles and the other as a function of mass ratio between the two components .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamil ] we introduce the model we study and explore the dynamics of a two species system consisting of one atom of one type and up to 4 atoms of other type . in this section",
    "we focus on the same mass case but vary the interaction strength between the two species . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] we extend our discussion to the mass imbalanced case and highlight the main effects by showing the behavior of the one - body density matrix for the impurity and majority particles .",
    "in addition we calculate the entanglement between them and show how the highest occupied orbitals evolve as we vary the interaction strength and mass ratio .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional mixture of @xmath1 identical bosons of one kind , a , with coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and one atom of kind b , with coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath1 identical bosons do not interact among themselves .",
    "we consider contact repulsive interactions between the @xmath5 bosons of type a and the additional b atom , which we call _ the impurity_. we model the interactions by a delta function of strength given by the coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "we assume the same trapping oscillator frequency @xmath7 for the bosons and the impurity , although we note that the formalism we use can in principle treat also different oscillator frequencies .",
    "we assume that the mass of the bosons , @xmath8 can be different from that of the impurity , @xmath9 .",
    "in this situation , the hamiltonian reads @xmath10 + g \\sum_{i=1}^{n_\\mathrm{a } } \\delta(x_i - y),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 . here , we scaled all energies by @xmath12 and all distances by the harmonic oscillator length @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the coupling constant @xmath6 is scaled by @xmath14 .    as a benchmark ,",
    "let us first briefly discuss the case in which @xmath15 and @xmath6 is tuned from zero to infinity . in the non - interacting case ,",
    "@xmath16 , the ground state is non - degenerate , and its wave function is real , positive , without zeros , and symmetric under the exchange of all atoms .",
    "it is given by @xmath17 with gaussian @xmath18 , and energy @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath20 , the wave function has to vanish at all points where @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "a wave function as an ansatz fulfilling this condition could be @xcite @xmath23 } \\\\ & \\times |x_1-y|\\;\\cdots |x_{n_\\mathrm{a}}-y|.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this wave function is zero whenever one of the bosons and the impurity are in the same position .",
    "this ansatz is real and positive , that is , it has zeros but not changes of sign .",
    "the fact that the impurity is distinguishable from the rest of bosons means that there is no symmetrization condition under the interchange of any of the bosons and the impurity .",
    "the modulus in eq .",
    "( [ eq : analyticalwf_3 ] ) enforces that when interchanging any a atom with the impurity , the wave function is even .",
    "but one can have an odd wave function under the interchange of the impurity and any a atom .",
    "these kind of functions have been discussed for @xmath24 in  @xcite ( see also the analysis based in symmetry arguments given in  @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown previously @xcite that the two - fold degeneracy comes from the fact that the impurity in the equal mass case is pushed to the side of the trap .",
    "it may sit on either the left- or right - hand side of all the bosons .",
    "however , since we need to conserve parity the two degenerate states will be even and odd linear combinations of having it localized on the left or the right @xcite .     and 9 .",
    "a quasi - degenerate pair occurs in the lowest part of the spectrum as @xmath25 .",
    "inset : energy per atom for @xmath20 as a function of the total number of atoms , @xmath26 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show how this quasi - degenerate energy pair appears as @xmath6 is increased , for @xmath27 and 9 .",
    "we calculated this spectra with a many - mode direct diagonalization algorithm as the one described in  @xcite for @xmath28 .",
    "we also calculated for larger number of atoms with the method described in  appendix  [ sec : app1 ] and  @xcite , obtaining the same quasi - degenerated pair in the lower part of the spectra for larger number of bosons . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the results for @xmath29 .",
    "note that for small @xmath6 , the energy per atom of the ground state is @xmath30 while the one of the excited state is @xmath31 . for large @xmath6 ,",
    "the energy of the quasi - degenerate pair is smaller as @xmath32 is increased , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( see @xcite ) .     and @xmath33 ( solid black , dashed blue and dotted red , respectively ) .",
    "( c ) entanglement entropy for the same cases .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines are the values taken from the analytical results for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    in this work we are interested in the complicated correlations and coherences that are present in the system due to the interactions between the bosons and the impurity . to this end",
    "it is natural to compute the one - body density matrices ( obdm ) for an a atom and for the impurity one .",
    "these read @xmath36 and @xmath37 this bosonic system is not in an ideal bose system state ( product of ground state single - particle wave functions ) when @xmath6 becomes sufficiently large .",
    "this conclusion can be reached from diagonalization of the obdm , which produces the natural orbitals and their occupations , @xmath38 .",
    "the largest occupation of a natural orbital for the bosons , @xmath39 , is reduced as @xmath6 is increased [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] . as one increases the number of bosons , the system is less disturbed by the presence of the impurity , and the value of @xmath40 for large @xmath6 gets closer to one . on the other hand ,",
    "the largest occupation of a natural orbit for the impurity , @xmath41 , is also reduced as @xmath6 is increased [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] . based on our investigation for @xmath42",
    "the final value of @xmath41 does not seem to depend on the number of atoms in a. moreover , if we consider two different parts of the system , one being the bosons and the other the impurity , one can see that there are strong quantum correlations built up among the two as @xmath6 is increased . in order to show this effect",
    ", we calculate the entanglement entropy , which is defined as @xmath43 $ ] , which can be obtained from the natural orbits occupation as @xmath44 .",
    "note that this formula provides the entanglement entropy between the bosons and the impurity because it corresponds to tracing out all degrees of freedom associated with a. as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) this entropy grows as @xmath6 is increased , showing that indeed the interactions are responsible for the built up of correlations between the bosons and the impurity .",
    "also we observe that the entanglement entropy grows steeply for @xmath45 . finally , this growth becomes sharper for larger values of @xmath32 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for values of the mass ratio larger than @xmath46 , the largest occupation of a natural orbital of both species grows toward a value close to 1 . for the bosons this final value coincides with different values of @xmath32 . on the contrary , for b",
    "this value is smaller for larger values of @xmath32 .",
    "further , the entanglement entropy drops quickly down .",
    "the final value of the entanglement entropy is larger for larger @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the density profile of the impurity shows that it localizes in the center of the trap , while the density profile of the bosons shows a minimum where the impurity is localized .",
    "so as one increases the mass ratio above one , the first effect is to increase the correlations among the bosons and the impurity .",
    "the impurity has a tendency to occupy the center of the trap due to the increase in its mass , but the repulsion with the bosons keeps it towards the edges of the system .",
    "remarkably , when the mass ratio is large enough as to produce the localization of the impurity in the center of the trap , the largest natural occupation of a tends to a value close to one .",
    "this in turn means that a single impurity is not able to fragment the bosons for large mass ratios .",
    "indeed , the fact that the largest occupation of a natural orbital for b is smaller and that the entanglement entropy is larger for larger @xmath32 shows that there is yet correlation between the bosons and the impurity which gets larger as @xmath32 is increased .",
    "we have shown that when the impurity and up to four bosons interact with each other the correlation in the system grows as a function of interaction strength .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that when the impurity is much heavier than the bosons , then we have the least possible correlation . moreover , the entropy reaches a maximum when the mass ratio is somewhere between 3 and 4 for up to four bosonic particles and then falls off afterwards .",
    "whether or not this holds for higher number of bosonic particles is an open question for future investigation . here , we did not study the possibility of tuning the trapping frequency for the impurity , which is an experimentally feasible strategy , but we expect that it will also lead to a strongly correlated state for certain value of @xmath47 .",
    "the study on the effect of @xmath47 or the combined effect of changing @xmath48 together with @xmath47 falls out of the scope of the paper and is left as an outlook .",
    "also , a detailed study of the limit of @xmath49 and how the threshold mass changes as @xmath20 is left for future investigations .",

    "in this section we explain briefly how we calculated the results for the 9 bosonic particles .",
    "the method is discussed in more details in @xcite , however , we also discuss some of the limitations in the method when it comes to the mass - imbalanced case .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "therefore we only remind that @xmath11 and all energies are scaled by @xmath12 and all distances by the harmonic oscillator length @xmath13 .",
    "we introduce an adiabatic decomposition of the total wave function of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a normalized eigenstate of the eigenproblem @xmath53 , where @xmath54 $ ] and the eigenvalue problem depends parametrically on @xmath4 . for a given @xmath6",
    ", we impose the condition that the total wave function must satisfy a delta - function boundary condition for @xmath21 , @xmath55 .",
    "this implies a discontinuity in the derivative of @xmath52 whenever @xmath21 or @xmath56 when @xmath57 .",
    "since we assume the bosonic particles are noninteracting with each other , we can write @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the symmetrization operator and @xmath60 is the @xmath61th normalized eigenstate of @xmath62 , which satisfies the delta - boundary condition . the index @xmath63 on @xmath52 denotes the many different ways to distribute the @xmath1 particles among the eigenstates of @xmath62 with the appropriate boundary condition . the hamiltonian for @xmath64 , which has to be solved , can now be written @xmath65 where @xmath66 the subscript @xmath67 on the brackets denote integration over all @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite and one can show that @xmath71 and @xmath72 scales with @xmath73 while @xmath74 scales with @xmath1 @xcite . for large @xmath1",
    "we can thus neglect all but the @xmath74 terms .",
    "particularly , if we only keep the first @xmath75 then we have @xmath76 furthermore , @xmath77 by additivity .",
    "once we have determined the functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 , see @xcite , we can compute the adiabatic potential for the ground state .",
    "the schrdinger equation for @xmath80 is then @xmath81    the energy @xmath82 provides a variational upper bound to the exact energy .",
    "the energies computed via this method for the polaron are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and agree with the numerical exact diagonalization results in @xcite to within a few percent and is expected to agree better for larger number of particles .    however , the equation above , eq .",
    "( [ polaroneffective ] ) , has some limitations in the strongly interacting case .",
    "the problem arises in the first term around @xmath83 as the impurity approaches zero from left and right .",
    "as the wave function @xmath78 changes suddenly from right to left of zero this gives a huge contribution to the derivative resulting in a peak / wall in the middle of the effective potential for the impurity .",
    "the change in @xmath78 and therefore the height of this wall is @xmath6 dependent .",
    "the stronger @xmath6 , the bigger is the change in the @xmath78 as the impurity is placed to the left and right side of @xmath83 .",
    "but the first term in the equation is also @xmath1 and @xmath84 dependent .",
    "as the impurity gets heavier the @xmath85 damps the huge contribution from the derivative , but the @xmath1 on the other hand has the opposite effect like @xmath6 .",
    "this means that when @xmath6 is strong , and we work with equal mass case , then the impurity is well separated and the physics of the impurity is not affected by this wall at all . but as one turns on for the mass imbalance , the impurity starts to move to the middle and starts to see this wall . all in all , the weak point of the method turns into a question of how big @xmath6 and @xmath1 are relative to the mass ratio . on the other hand ,",
    "if one knows that the impurity will be at the edges , then the method is very powerful to predict the energy and wave function for the polaron system .",
    "otherwise an analysis of each contributing factors , @xmath6 , @xmath1 and @xmath84 , has to be made in order to validate the method .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath86 and @xmath87 case , the method works perfectly for any @xmath84 .",
