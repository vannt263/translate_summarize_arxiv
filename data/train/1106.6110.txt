    "fluctuations and correlations are well known signatures of phase transitions . in particular , the quark / gluon to hadronic phase transition may lead to significant fluctuations @xcite . in 2010 , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) began a program to search for the qcd critical point .",
    "this involves an `` energy scan '' of au+au collisions from top collision energy ( @xmath3 = 200 gev ) down to energies as low as @xmath3 = 7.7 gev @xcite .",
    "this critical point search will make use of the study of correlations and fluctuations , particularly those that could be enhanced during a phase transition that passes close to the critical point @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 quantifies deviations in the particle ratios from those expected for an ideal statistical poissonian distribution @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath5 ( describing fluctuations in the @xmath0 ratio ) is , @xmath6 a formula similar to ( [ nudyn ] ) can be constructed for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ratio fluctuations .",
    "additional information about @xmath4 can be found in @xcite .",
    "earlier measurements of particle ratio fluctuations utilized the variable @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the two variables are related as @xmath8 .",
    "the data presented here for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 dynamical fluctuations was acquired by the star experiment at rhic from minimum bias ( mb ) au+au collisions at @xmath3 = 7.7 , 11.5 , 39 , 62.4 , and 200 gev @xcite .",
    "particle identification cuts can be found in @xcite .",
    "data was also analyzed using the recently completed time of flight ( tof ) detector @xcite .",
    "tof identified particles extended the @xmath9 range of pions and kaons from , @xmath10 gev/@xmath11 and protons from @xmath12 gev/@xmath11 .",
    "we estimate that pion contamination of kaons is less than 3% using a combination of the star tpc and tof .",
    "new results for dynamical particle ratio fluctuations from the rhic energy scan are shown in figures [ ppi_excitation ] , [ kp_excitation ] , and [ kpi_excitation ] .",
    "figure [ ppi_excitation ] shows the measured dynamical @xmath1 fluctuations as a function of incident energy , expressed as @xmath13 .",
    "the measured fluctuations from the star experiment are plotted as the black stars , from the na49 experiment @xcite at the sps as blue squares , and two transport model predictions from urqmd and hsd ( red and black lines , respectively ) , using the star experimental acceptance . all model predictions in this proceeding",
    "are processed through the same acceptance .",
    "the published na49 results have been converted to @xmath4 using the relation @xmath8 .",
    "star measures a general trend from larger , negative values of @xmath1 fluctuations at lower energies , which then increases towards zero at @xmath3 = 200 gev .",
    "these fluctuations are negative due to the dominance of the third term ( correlated production , e.g. @xmath14 ) in @xmath13 .",

    "this is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the trend measured for dynamical @xmath1 fluctuations .",
    "the experimental trend observed by star at the lowest incident energies ( @xmath3 = 7.7 and 11.5 gev ) is dramatically different than that measured by na49 .",
    "the star result is consistent with negative dynamical @xmath2 fluctuations down to @xmath3 = 7.7 gev , while that from na49 is consistent with zero and increases to a positive value at @xmath3 = 6.3 gev .",

    "figure [ netp ] shows the experimental measurements for the products of the higher moments of the net - proton distribution .",
