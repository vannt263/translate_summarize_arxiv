    "the recent development of atom trapping technologies @xcite has led to the opening of new research fields of many - body physics . in particular , the possibility of controlling to a large degree the shape of the trapping potential has permitted the experimental realization of nearly isolated low dimensional interacting boson systems @xcite , and the observation of the bosonic mott insulator @xcite .",
    "moreover , the use of fano - feshbach resonances @xcite allows experimentalist to control interaction strength in the low dimensional atomic gases @xcite .",
    "this has permitted the observation of the girardeau @xcite fermionization of one - dimensional bosons with strongly repulsive interactions @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , fermions as well as bosons with repulsive interactions in one dimension are in the tomonaga - luttinger liquid state @xcite . the bosonization technique @xcite allows the description of their low - energy physics in terms of collective phonon - like modes as well as the computation of the various correlation functions .",
    "it is found that in the tomonaga - luttinger liquid state at zero temperature , only quasi - long range order ( whether superfluid or density wave ) can be obtained , with correlation functions decaying as power laws , the exponent of the power law being a rational function of the tomonaga - luttinger parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter @xmath0 depends on interaction . in the case of bosons with contact interaction",
    "@xcite , this parameter can be calculated exactly , and it is found that @xmath1 making superfluidity the dominant correlation . when the interaction becomes extremely repulsive , or the density becomes very low ,",
    "the girardeau model is recovered @xcite and the exponent @xmath0 goes to 1 . in the case of spinless fermions , perturbative calculations @xcite show that the exponent @xmath0 is smaller than 1 for repulsive interactions ( thus favoring density waves ) and larger than 1 for attractive interactions ( thus favoring a @xmath2-wave type superfluidity ) . for finite temperatures ,",
    "the correlation functions decay exponentially , with a correlation length inversely proportional to temperature .",
    "such behavior gives rise to susceptibilities that diverge as a power law with temperature , with an exponent determined by the zero temperature correlation exponent .",
    "recent experiments @xcite with trapped atoms have shown the possibility of realizing many - body systems mixing fermions and bosons . from the theoretical point of view , mixtures of bosons and spinless fermions in one dimension were considered in refs .  .",
    "it was found that sufficiently strong repulsion or attraction between fermionic and bosonic atoms could result in respectively a phase separation or a collapse , while interactions of moderate strength would lead ( in the case of incommensuration between the atom densities ) to the formation of a two - component tomonaga - luttinger liquid . in refs .",
    ", it was proposed to describe the two - component tomonaga - luttinger liquid in terms of polarons , and various exponents of correlation functions were obtained .",
    "an integrable model of interacting bosons and fermions was considered in refs .  , in which a two - component tomonaga - luttinger liquid was found .",
    "the mixture has also been investigated in numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "more recent experimental work has considered mixtures of fermionic atoms .",
    "motivated by these experiments , there has been some numerical studies of mixtures of three fermionic species @xcite .",
    "although the one - dimensional boson fermion mixture has been studied extensively including analytical expression of the exponents@xcite of the equal time correlation function , the previous work has emphasized the polaron correlations over the density wave correlations .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to analyze the competition between density - wave and superfluid correlation as interactions in the system are varied . besides the question of the effect of interaction on the exponents , an important question relevant for experiment is the evolution of the exponents as a function of relative concentration of fermions and bosons in the mixture .",
    "fermions could have two opposite effects . on the one hand",
    ", fermionic particles can give rise to retarded attractive interactions between the bosons , which can compensate the direct boson - boson repulsion and favor superfluidity and possibly collapse of the mixture .",
    "on the other hand , fermionic particles do not form bose condensates , and may thus disfavor the formation of a superfluid state .",
    "for the simple bose - fermi mixture model , it is useful to examine the effect of the doping on the correlated states of respective particles , e.g. , how the superfluidity is enhanced or suppressed by the interaction between boson and fermion .",
    "a last question , in order to compare numerical and analytical result , is to develop a phenomenological bosonization scheme allowing for the calculation of the parameters of the low energy effective hamiltonian from ground state energy calculations .    in the present article",

    "we show that for this model , the variation of the bosonic superfluid exponent with fermion density is not monotonous in the case of a weak interaction .",
