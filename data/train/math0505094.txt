    "a _ composition _ of a nonnegative integer @xmath1 is a sequence @xmath2 of positive integers whose sum is @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the empty sequence with no terms to be the unique composition of 0 .",
    "we will sometimes write compositions as sums rather than as words , as in @xmath3 , though it must be kept in mind that the order of the terms still matters .",
    "it is sometimes helpful to think of a composition of @xmath0 as a sequence of @xmath0 stones laid in a row , together with a grouping together of the stones in such a way that every stone belongs to a group , every group contains a stone , no stone belongs to two groups , and two stones belong to the same group only if every stone between them belongs to that group .    each term @xmath4 in a composition @xmath5",
    "is called a _ part _ of that composition . a part equal to @xmath6",
    "is called a @xmath6-part . a @xmath7 in a composition is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of the first @xmath8 parts of the composition for some nonnegative integer @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the composition @xmath9 has 5 splits : 0 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 7 .",
    "using the imagery of stones , the groups of stones are the parts of @xmath5 , and the splits of @xmath5 correspond to the spaces between groups ( including the space to the left of the first group and to the right of the last group ) .",
    "we use @xmath10 to denote the composition comprising the parts of @xmath5 written in reverse order . a _",
    "palindromic composition _ , or a _ palindrome _ , is a composition for which @xmath11 .",
    "_ drop _ ) is a part followed by a larger ( resp .",
    "smaller ) part .",
    "a _ level _ is a part followed by a part equal to itself .",
    "frequencies of occurrences of @xmath6-parts , rises , drops , and levels in ( palindromic ) compositions , as well as in compositions with additional restrictions , have been studied ( e.g. , see  @xcite and  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "heubach and mansour ( @xcite ) give a multivariate generating function for joint distribution of parts , rises , levels , and drops in compositions and palindromes .",
    "however , using the results from the literature related to the subject , it does not seem to be possible to answer a question like : how many levels are followed by rises among all compositions of @xmath0 ? to consider a more general question ,",
    "we introduce the notion of a _ segmented pattern _ in a composition .",
    "a segmented pattern is a word @xmath12 in the alphabet of positive integers such that if @xmath13 is a letter in @xmath14 and @xmath15 , then @xmath16 is a letter of @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , the letters in @xmath14 constitute an order ideal .",
    "for example , @xmath17 is a segmented pattern , while @xmath18 is not .",
    "we say that @xmath19 occurs in a composition @xmath20 if there is a subword @xmath21 of @xmath22 that is order - isomorphic to @xmath19 .",
    "thus , rises , drops , and levels are occurrences of the patterns 12 , 21 , and 11 , respectively . a level followed by a rise is an occurrence of the pattern 112 .",
    "the notion of segmented patterns in arbitrary words was studied in @xcite .",
    "more generally , we study occurrences of so - called _ segmented partially ordered patterns _ ( spops ) in compositions .",
    "a spop @xmath23 is a word consisting of letters from a partially ordered alphabet @xmath24 such that the letters in @xmath14 constitute an order ideal in @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , if we have a poset on three elements labeled by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in which the only relation is @xmath28 , then the sequence 31254 has two occurrences of @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 and @xmath31 . given a spop @xmath32 , we say that a segmented pattern @xmath33 is a _ linear extension _ of @xmath14 if @xmath34 implies that @xmath35 .",
    "thus the linear extensions of @xmath36 are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ compositions ] , we give our main results .",
    "theorem [ mainresult ] gives a multivariate generating function for the number of occurrences of a given spop at a given split among compositions of @xmath1 with a given number of parts . by specializing variables , we obtain a generating function for the number of occurrences of a given spop among all compositions of @xmath0 ( corollary [ maincor ] ) . in theorem",
    "[ numkpartsthm ] , we enumerate the occurrences of @xmath6-parts at a given split in compositions of @xmath0 with a given number of parts . this generalizes a result in @xcite .",
    "our approach to this problem is to use a method which perhaps can be best described as  encoding by restricted permutations . \"",
    "the idea here is to encode a set of objects under consideration as a set of permutations satisfying certain restrictions . under appropriate encodings , this allows us to transfer the interesting statistics from our original set to the set of permutations , where they are easy to handle . in section [ palindromes ] ,",
    "we use restricted permutations to enumerate @xmath6-blocks with certain statistics in palindromic compositions , refining results in @xcite . in section",
    "[ last ] we provide short bijective encodings of binary bitonic sequences , binary strings without singletons , permutations avoiding @xmath40 and having exactly one descent , and lines drawn through the points of intersections of @xmath1 straight lines in a plane .",
    "relations of these objects to certain restricted permutations were given in  @xcite , but no bijections were provided .",
    "we believe that these examples provide some evidence for the broad applicability of the method of encoding by restricted permutations .",
    "we use the following notations throughout the paper .",
    "the set of nonnegative integers is denoted by @xmath41 , and the set of positive integers is denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "given @xmath43 , we write @xmath44=\\{m , m+1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] and @xmath45 = [ 1,n]$ ] .",

    "we use @xmath49 to denote the set of compositions of @xmath0 , and we write that @xmath50 if @xmath51 . finally , let @xmath52 be the number of compositions of @xmath53 with @xmath54 parts .",
    "it is well known and easy to verify that for a fixed non - negative integer @xmath54 , the generating function for @xmath52 is given by @xmath55",
    "given a spop @xmath56 with @xmath57 parts , let @xmath58 be the number of occurrences of @xmath14 among compositions of @xmath0 with @xmath59 parts such that the sum of the parts preceding the occurrence is @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the generating function for @xmath62 : @xmath63 our goal is to derive an explicit rational function for @xmath61 .    before proceeding ,",
