    "the extensive air shower ( eas ) inverse approach to a problem of the primary energy spectra reconstruction in the region of @xmath0 pev energies has been an essential tool in the past decade @xcite .",
    "basically , it follows from the high accuracies of recent experiments @xcite and the availability of the eas simulation code @xcite , which was developed in the framework of contemporary interaction models in order to compute the kernel functions of a corresponding integral equation set @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the energy spectra of primary ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) nuclei obtained from the kascade experiment @xcite using the eas inverse approach disagree with the same data from the ongoing gamma experiment @xcite , where parameterization of the eas inverse problem is used .",
    "+ below , a peculiarity of the eas inverse problem is investigated , and one of the possible reasons for the observed disagreements between the energy spectra in @xcite and @xcite is considered in the framework of the sibyll @xcite interaction model .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 the eas inverse approach and the definition of the problem of uniqueness is described .",
    "it is shown , that the abundance of primary nuclear species leads to pseudo solutions for unfolded primary energy spectra . the existence and significance of the pseudo solutions",
    "are shown in section  4 .",
    "the pseudo solutions for primary energy spectra were obtained on the basis of simulation of kascade @xcite shower spectra .",
    "the eas simulation model is presented in section  3 . in section 5",
    "the peculiarities of the pseudo solutions are discussed in comparison with the methodical errors of the kascade data .",
    "the eas inverse problem is ill - posed by definition and the unfolding of the corresponding integral equations does not ensure the uniqueness of the solutions .",
    "the regularized unfolding on the basis of _ a priori _ information on expected solutions ( smoothness , monotony and non - negativity ) in some cases can redefine the inverse problem @xcite and provide the appropriate solutions .",
    "however , the expected singularities ( e.g. knees ) in the primary energy spectra at @xmath3 ev may erroneously be smoothed by regularization algorithms and vice versa , be imitated by the unavoidable oscillations @xcite of the solutions .",
    "furthermore , the eas inverse problem implies evaluations of at least two or more unknown primary energy spectra from the integral equation set of fredholm kind @xcite .",
    "these peculiarities have not been studied in detail and the problem of the uniqueness of solutions can limit the number of evaluated spectra .",
    "+ let @xmath4 be the energy spectrum of a primary nucleus @xmath5 over the atmosphere , @xmath6 be the probability density function describing the transformation of @xmath5 and @xmath7 parameters of the primary nucleus to a measurable vector @xmath8 . then the eas inverse problem , i.e. the reconstruction of the energy spectra of @xmath9 primary nuclei on the basis of the detected spectra @xmath10 of eas parameters , is defined by the integral equation @xmath11 evidently , if @xmath12 are the solutions of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the functions @xmath13 should also be the solutions of ( 1 ) , provided equation @xmath14 is satisfied for the given measurement errors @xmath15 and for at least one of the combinations of the primary nuclei @xmath16 the number of combinations ( 3 ) stems from a possibility of the existence of a set of functions @xmath17 for each of the primary nuclei ( @xmath5 ) , which can independently satisfy eq .",
    "+ for example , suppose that @xmath18 .",
    "let us denote @xmath19 by @xmath20 and , for simplicity , set the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) to 0 . then",
    ", following expression ( 3 ) , we find @xmath21 independent combinations of eq .",
    "( 2 ) : @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with different @xmath29 functions .",
    "the measurement errors @xmath30 on the right - hand side of these equations can both increase and decrease the domains of @xmath29 functions .",
    "+ one may call the set of functions @xmath31 the pseudo functions with the corresponding pseudo solutions ( spectra ) @xmath13 .",
    "the oscillating @xmath32 functions at @xmath33 are responsible for the first @xmath9 equations @xmath34 , @xmath35 , due to the positive - definite probability density function @xmath36 .",
    "the pseudo solutions @xmath37 can be avoided by using iterative unfolding algorithms @xcite .",
    "+ additional sources of the pseudo solutions originate from the mutually compensative effects at @xmath38 : @xmath39 inherent to eq .",
    "( 2 ) for arbitrary groups of @xmath40 and @xmath41 primary nuclei .",
    "since there are no limitations on the types of the pseudo functions ( except for @xmath42 ) that would follow from expression ( 4 ) , and the number of possible combinations ( 3 ) rapidly increases with the number of evaluated primary spectra ( @xmath9 ) , the problem of the uniqueness of solutions may be insoluble for @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the pseudo functions have to restrict the efficiency of unfolding energy spectra for @xmath44 , because the unification of @xmath45 primary nuclei spectra into @xmath46 nuclear species ( e.g. light and heavy ) inevitably increases the uncertainties of the kernel functions @xmath36 and thereby also increases the domains of the pseudo functions .",
    "+ notice , that the pseudo solutions will always appear in the iterative unfolding algorithms if the initial iterative values are varied within large intervals . at the same time",
    ", it is practically impossible to derive the pseudo functions from the unfolding of equations  ( 1,2 ) due to a strong ill - posedness of the inverse problem .",
    "however , for a given set of the measurement errors @xmath15 and the known kernel functions @xmath6 for @xmath35 primary nuclei , eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be regularized by parametrization of the pseudo functions @xmath47 .",
    "the unknown parameters @xmath48 can be derived from a numerical solution of parametric eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and thereby one may also evaluate the parametrized pseudo functions @xmath31 .",
    "+ below ( section  3 ) , an eas simulation model for computing the kernel function @xmath36 and replicating the kascade @xcite eas spectral errors @xmath15 is considered .",
    "the primary energy spectra obtained in the kascade experiment were derived on the basis of the detected 2-dimensional eas size spectra @xmath49 and an iterative unfolding algorithm @xcite for @xmath50 primary nuclei @xcite . evidently , whether these solutions are unique or not depends on the significance of the arbitrary pseudo functions @xmath51 from eq .",
    "+ we suppose that the convolution of the shower spectra @xmath52 at the observation level and corresponding measurement errors @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xcite are described by 2-dimensional log - normal distributions with parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and correlation coefficients @xmath59 between the shower size ( @xmath60 ) and the muon truncated size ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by the @xmath62 goodness - of - fit test using the corsika(nkg ) eas simulation code @xcite for the sibyll2.1 @xcite interaction model , 4 kinds of primary nuclei ( @xmath63 ) , 5 energies ( @xmath64 pev ) and simulation samples for each of @xmath7 and @xmath5 : 5000 , 3000 , 2000 , 1500 , 1000 respectively in @xmath65 zenith angular interval .",
    "the values of corresponding @xmath66 , ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) were distributed randomly in the interval @xmath69 for the measurement ranges of the kascade experiment ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) and the bin sizes @xmath72 .",
    "+ notice , that the combined 2-dimensional log - normal distributions with parameters @xmath73 at @xmath74 , @xmath75 at @xmath76 , @xmath77 at @xmath78 and @xmath79 at @xmath80 , more precisely ( @xmath81 ) describe the shower spectra @xmath52 in the tail regions .",
    "+ we performed an additional test of the log - normal fit of the @xmath82 spectra using multiple correlation analysis for the shower parameters simulated by the log - normal @xmath52 probability density functions and shower parameters obtained from the corsika eas simulations at power - law primary energy spectra ( @xmath83 ) and equivalent abundances of primary nuclei .",
    "the corresponding correlation coefficients were equal to @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and were in close agreement for both methods of @xmath88 and @xmath89 generations .",
    "we replicated the kascade 2-dimensional eas size spectrum @xmath90 ( and corresponding @xmath91 ) by picking out @xmath88 and @xmath92 randomly from the 2-dimensional shower spectra @xmath52 after randomly picking @xmath5 and @xmath7 parameters of a primary particle from the power - law energy spectra @xmath93 with a rigidity - dependent knee @xmath94 , the sharpness parameter @xmath95 and normalization of the all - particle spectrum @xmath96 .",
    "the relative abundance of nuclei was arbitrarily chosen to be @xmath97 and @xmath98 for primary @xmath99 and @xmath2 nuclei respectively , which approximately conforms with the expected abundance from balloon and satellite data @xcite .",
    "+ the mediate values of the parameters of the probability density function @xmath100 were estimated by the corresponding log - parabolic splines .",
    "+ the total number of simulated eas events was set to @xmath101 in order to replicate the corresponding statistical errors @xmath102 of the kascade data .",
    "on the basis of the obtained estimations of @xmath102 ( section  3 ) for the kascade experiment , we examined the uniqueness of unfolding ( 1 ) by @xmath62-the minimization : @xmath103 where @xmath104 represents the left - hand side of eq .",

    "the singularity of the proton spectrum was approximately compensated by the @xmath125 and @xmath126 spectra .",
    "this is due to both the large number ( @xmath127 ) of possible mutually compensative combinations ( 3 ) and the peculiarities of eas development in the atmosphere ( kernel functions @xmath36 , section  3 ) , which are expressed by the approximately log - linear dependences of the statistical parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 of shower spectra @xmath36 on energy ( @xmath132 ) and nucleon number ( @xmath133 ) of primary nuclei @xcite .",
