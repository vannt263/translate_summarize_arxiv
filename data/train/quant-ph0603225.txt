    "the calculation reveals that bob gains no information whatsoever from alice s decisions , unless she classically informs bob about them .",
    "mathematically this can be expressed through the unitary character of the process . if no classical information is exchanged , the evolution is locally unitary ( @xmath148\\otimes u^{(b)}[\\psi^{(b)}]$ ] ) and thus can not change the entanglement shared by both parties ( the entanglement is invariant under local unitary evolution ) .",
    "consequently no information through the purely quantum channel can be obtained . on the contrary , if alice classically sends information to bob , she is actually selecting a subset of her incoming fermions , i.e.  she is _ projecting _ her state ( @xmath149 $ ] , where @xmath150 is an orthogonal projector ) , which is a non - unitary operator which changes the entanglement class .",
    "this fact allows them to exploit the initial quantum correlations between their fermions to establish a communication protocol .    in summary",
    ", this example shows once more the impossibility of using quantum correlations , i.e.  entanglement to exchange information without the aid of classical communication .",
    "we showed the spin entanglement loss by transfer of correlations to the momentum of one of the particles , through a local spin - momentum entangling interaction .",
    "this phenomenon , already analyzed for a non - interacting particular case in the context of wigner rotations of special relativity , may produce decoherence of bell spin states .",
    "the momentum of each particle is a very simple reservoir and indeed it is one that can not be eliminated by improving the experimental conditions , due to heisenberg s principle .",
    "we show that an @xmath0 fermion ( photon ) , which initially belongs to a bell spin state , may lose its spin correlations due to this physical phenomenon when traversing a local magnetic field ( optically - active medium ) .",
    "these specific media entangle each component of the spin state of the particle with its momentum , like in a stern - gerlach device .",
    "this could have implications for quantum communication and information processing devices .",
