    "in recent years intensive investigations of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) have been made in the promising context of nanophotonics .",
    "this research is actually motivated by the current trends for optical device miniaturisation and by the possibilities of merging aspects of nanophotonics with those of electronics .",
    "spps are electromagnetic waves bounded to dielectric - metal interface .",
    "as surface waves , spps are exponentially damped in the directions perpendicular to the interface @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spps could be used to transfer optical information in a two dimensional ( 2d ) environment .",
    "this appealing property can be used for optical addressing of different 2d optical systems and nanostructures located at a dielectric / metal interface .",
    "actually several 2d spp devices including passive nanostructures including mirrors or beam splitter and active elements like molecules or quantum dots are currently under development and investigation .",
    "developments such as these raise the prospect of a new branch of photonics using spps , for which the term `` plasmonics '' emerged @xcite .",
    "+ however , for experimental investigations of optical devices an important characteristic of spp modes is that their spatial extent is governed and defined by the geometry of the nanoelements rather that by the optical wavelength @xcite .",
    "this consequently opens possibilities for breaking the diffraction limit but requires instruments of observation adapted essentially to the subwalength regime and being capable of imaging the propagation of spps in their 2d environment .",
    "usually the analysis of the subwalength regime implies necessarily near field optical ( nfo ) methods @xcite able to collect the evanescent ( i.  e. , non radiative ) components of the electromagnetic fields associated with spps . however , when the metal film on which the 2d optical elements are built is thin enough ( i.  e  .",
    ", with a thickness below 80 - 100 nm ) and when the subtratum optical constant ( usually glass ) is higher than the one of the superstratum medium an other possibility for analyzing spp propagation occurs .",
    "this possibility is based on the detection of coherent leaking of spps through the substratum .",
    "such a far - field optical method is called leakage radiation microscopy ( lrm ) @xcite and allows indeed a direct quantitative imaging and analysis of spp propagation on thin metal films .",
    "+ the aim of this article is to present a short overview of recent progress in the field of spp imaging using lrm . in a first part of this work we will describe the theoretical principles underlying lrm . in the second part we will discuss modern leakage radiation methods and illustrate the lrm potentialities by analyzing few experiments with spp waves interacting with 2d plasmonic devices .",
    "in order to describe the theoretical mechanisms explaining leakage radiation it will be sufficient for the present purpose to limit our analysis to the case of a metal film of complex permittivity @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the pulsation ) sandwiched between two dielectric media of permittivity @xmath2 ( substrate ) and @xmath3 ( superstratum ) . this system is theoretically simple and to a good extent experimentally accessible @xcite . in the limiting case where the film thickness @xmath4 is much bigger than the spp penetration length in the metal ( i.  e. , @xmath5 nm for gold or silver in the visible domain )",
    "one can treat the problem as two uncoupled single interfaces .",
    "we will consider as an example the interface 0/1 ( the media 0 and 1 are located in the domain @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ) .",
    "such an interface will be identified in the following with the plane @xmath8 in cartesian coordinates .",

    "the inset shows the conventions for the axes x and z. the arrows indicate the direction of the real part of the wave vector normally and parallely to the interface.,width=302 ]    indeed , due to ohmic losses in the metal we expect an exponentially decaying spp wave propagating along the interface .",
    "this condition implies the relation @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this inequality is actually always fulfilled since from eq .",
    "3 one deduces @xmath22 which is indeed positive because @xmath23 . by writing @xmath24",
    "one additionally obtains the relation @xmath25 this relation fixes the sign conventions since the wave must also decay exponentially when going away from the interface in both media .",
    "more precisely one gets @xmath26 @xmath27the product @xmath28 is positive if @xmath29 , a fact which is indeed true for silver and gold interfaces with air or glass in most of the visible optical domain .",
    "however small negative values of eq .",
    "8 occur for silver close to the interband region around @xmath30 .",
    "additionally a higher value of @xmath2 will also change the sign in eq .",
    "1 shows the behavior of the spp magnetic field close to an interface gold / air and gold / glass at the optical wavelength @xmath19 nm . at such a wavelength the conditions given by eqs .",
    "5 - 8 impose the solutions @xmath31 the real parts of the @xmath32 components of the spp wave vector are for both media oriented in the same direction corresponding to a wave propagating from the air side to the metal side ( see inset in fig .  1 ) .",
    "furthermore the waves are exponentially damped when going away from the interface in agreement with eq .  7 , 8 ( see fig .  1 ) . most important for us",

    "however it can be shown on the metal side and for wavelengths not too close from the spectral region associated with the interband transition of gold or silver that the energy flow in the x direction is oriented oppositely to the wave vector @xmath36 $ ] since @xmath37=(k'_x\\epsilon'_1+k''_x\\epsilon''_1)/|\\epsilon_1|^{2}$ ] is dominated by @xmath38 and since @xmath39 .",

    "this implies in particular that the energy associated with the spp wave is absorbed by the metal during its propagation through the interface from the air side to the glass side .",
    "it should be observed that already in the case of the ideal plasma model neglecting losses the wave vector @xmath45 is antiparallel to @xmath46 in the metal since there is no imaginary part and since @xmath47 ( see also @xcite ) . + we show in fig .",

    "the real part of the dispersion is close to the asymptotic light lines : we speak about zenneck surface modes by opposition to fano and evanescent modes existing close to the interband @xcite .     with @xmath51 .",
    "the light cones corresponding to an optical wave propagating in air and glass ( i.  e. , in the bulk medium ) are represented by a thin and thick continuous line respectively .",

    "( b ) imaginary part of the dispersion relations showing the evolution of @xmath48 with @xmath51 . the damping is higher for the glass / gold interface.,width=302 ]    an important feature occurs close to this interband transition since the slope in fig .",
    "2a is diverging .",
    "this means that the group velocity defined by @xmath53 is infinite .",
    "one can qualitatively deduce that there is however no paradox with causality by remarking that the propagation length is approaching zero at such wavelengths . actually the spp life time @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 is tending as well to zero .",
    "this is a clear signature of the absence of significant spp propagation in the interband spectral region .",
    "this fact actually precludes faster than light information transfer by spp waves and is in agreement with relativistic causality . + a second important feature concerning fig .",
    "2 a is that the air / gold dispersion curve is located inside of the light cone for glass defined by the equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a real light wave vector and @xmath20 . writing @xmath58 $ ] the wavevector of a tm ( i.  e. , p polarized ) plane wave propagating away from the interfaces into the glass side one see that spps propagating at the air / metal interface can radiate into the glass substrate if the condition @xmath59\\ ] ] is approximately fulfilled . here",
    "we neglected the role of the imaginary part in eq .",
    "similarly one can deduce that none of the spps propagating at the two interfaces can radiates into the air side .",
    "+ in order to have a more complete analysis one must actually consider the problem with two coupled interface 0/1 ( glass / metal ) and 1/2 ( metal / air ) supporting spp waves and separated by a small distance @xmath4 .",
    "the two interfaces are coupled by evanescent spp waves tunnelling through the metal slab .",
    "such a mathematical problem can only be treated numerically by resolving an implicit equation . as for the single interface",
    "this equation can be defined directly from maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "however it is much easier and convenient for the following to remark with raether @xcite that eq",
    ".  2 and consequently eq .  3 are obtained by finding the zeros of the numerator in the fresnel reflectivity coefficient for a tm wave coming from the dielectric side : @xmath60 with @xmath61 . actually raether @xcite reasoned with the denominator of the fresnel coefficient due to different conventions for the signs of the wave vectors @xmath62 .",
    "however it is remarkable that the result is the same at the end of the calculations .",
    "identically one can thus define the fresnel coefficient for a tm wave reflected by the slab 0 - 1 - 2 @xcite : @xmath63 and find the zeros of the numerator , i.  e. , one can solve the implicit equation @xmath64 in order to define the spp dispersion relations . from this equation",
    "it follows that @xmath65 as for the single interface one has an important relation between the real and imaginary parts of the spp wave vectors in the different medium : @xmath66 since we are interested only into the solutions which are decaying along the interface we ( in agreement with our previous treatment of the single interface ) suppose the condition @xmath67 satisfied .",
    "a second important point is that due to the arbitrariness in the sign of @xmath62 there are in fact apriori 8 possibilities for writing eq .",
    "15 . however , eq .  15 is invariant under the transformation @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the number of apriori possibilities for the sign of @xmath62 is reduced from 8 to 4 .",
    "this multiplicity was studied by burke _",
    "@xcite however since for the present purpose we are looking for spp waves leaking from the air / metal interface into the glass substrate we will consider only the possibility @xmath69 the sign of @xmath70 is however arbitrary as explained above and we choose it here positive by definition .",
    "in order to define a spp wave leaking into the glass substrate one has thus to substitute eq .",

    "this is clearly reminiscent of our former analysis of spps propagating at the single air / metal .",
    "in addition however the wave is leaking radiatively ( i.  e. , propagatively ) into the glass substrate .",
    "however from eq .  18 and the condition @xmath81 it is clear that the leaking wave is exponentially growing in the -z direction when going away from the gold slab .",
    "this is already the result we obtained when we considered the limit of the thick slab .",

    "11 and the idea of phase matching between the ( real part ) of the spp wave vector with a propagative plane wave vector in the glass substrate .",
    "however such paradoxes disappear for two reasons : first , an infinite energy occurs only because we considered an infinite interface or equivalently because we did not consider how the spp is locally launched on the metal film .",

    "we now block the information associated with the central beam and with the r or t beams @xcite .",
    "thereby the according spp beam images are erased from the image plane and consequently weak intensity beams otherwise observed by interference can be directly analyzed . for further analysis we extracted radial cross - cuts along the white lines as shown in fig .",

    "results are shown in fig .",
    "11 a for the cross cut along @xmath131 .",
    "the data points agree very well with a lorentz fit given by eqs .  20 , 21 .",
    "the fwhm of the lorentzian distribution gives us a spp propagation length of @xmath132 @xmath101 m .",
    "this value is in perfect agreement with the cross - cut made along the beam @xmath131 in the direct space image 10 a ( see fig .",
    "both data agree also with values given by the dispersion relations discussed in sect .  1 ( see figs .",
    "2b and 3b ) .",
    "+     nm and @xmath133 nm , respectively .",
    "the gold ridge and plasmonic crystal are indicated by the gray line and the gray box , respectively .",
    "the vector basis @xmath134 of the latices is indicated in a and e. data from @xcite ( @xmath88 nanoletters , american chemical society , 2007 ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    lrm was subsequently applied by us to many spp in - plane devices such as beam splitters @xcite , dielectric lenses , prisms @xcite and wave - guides @xcite . in particular , lrm experiments were compared to near field optical experiments ( photon scanning tunnelling microscopy ) and showed good agreement in the cases considered @xcite .",
    "lrm appears thus in this context as a complementary far - field optical method to nfo such as nsom .",
    "lrm was applied as well for analyzing spp bragg mirrors ( with high reflectivity @xmath135% ) , interferometers @xcite and spp elliptical cavities @xcite or 2d spp microscopes @xcite . in this context",
    "we observed @xcite stationary spp waves with very high visibility @xmath136 by using lrm .",
    "this proves directly that spp wave coherence is conserved in lrm and can exploited for quantitative analysis down to the spatial resolution limit @xmath137 .",
    "actually spp interferometers such as the ones described in @xcite reveal clear interference pattern and oscillation characteristics of these devices .",
    "it is thus possible to develop 2d interferometry for spp waves having all the advantages of current macroscopic interferometry techniques .",
    "+ we also mention the realization of plasmonic crystals ( i.  e. , photonic crystals for spps ) which were studied using lrm ( see fig .",
    "12 ) . in such devices @xcite rectangular 2d latices made of gold nano - protrusions ( 200 nm diameter , 50 nm height ) deposited on a 50 nm thick gold film ( see fig .",
    "12b ) are used to create photonic band gaps at specific spp wavelengths @xmath138 nm and @xmath133 nm ( i.  e. , laser wavelengths of respectively 750 nm and 800 nm ) corresponding to the two periods of the lattice @xmath139 nm and @xmath140 nm . the existence of these band gaps implies that spp plane waves impinging on small devices build up with such lattice will generate stationary waves in the crystal .",
    "more precisely this implies that spps will be reflected in specific and different directions if their wavelengths match the values @xmath141 or @xmath142 and if the angle of incidence relatively to the normal to the bragg planes of the crystal ( figs .",
    "12 b , c ) equals @xmath143 .",
    "such devices act consequently as an efficient in - plane wavelength demultiplexer for spps @xcite as it was indeed observed experimentally ( see fig .",
    "12d and e ) .",
    "while the results discussed here were achieved within the visible spectral range , plasmonic crystal devices are expected to perform even better ( e.g. , in terms of spectral selectivity ) in the infrared ( telecom ) spectral range due to significantly lower ohmic losses @xcite . in general , the use of multiplexers , splitters and tritters @xcite in photonic applications might be specifically appealing due to their small footprint in the range of @xmath144 @xmath101m@xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , the use as building blocks for classical @xcite or quantum @xcite optical computing can be envisaged .",
    "in this article we reviewed the field of leakage radiation microscopy ( lrm ) theoretically and experimentally .",
    "theoretically we analyzed how spp can generate leaky wave in the glass substrate by tunnelling from the air side through a thin metal film supporting spp waves .",
    "we showed in particular that for thick film ( @xmath76 nm ) leakage radiation ( lr ) does not affect the dispersion relation on the air / metal interface .",
    "importantly the angular distribution of lr is located on a cone matching the spp dispersion relation .",
    "we also reviewed the first experimental results reporting the observation of lr on rough surface and using near field optics methods .",
    "we analyzed more recent application of lrm to spp nano - devices fabricated by electron beam lithography .",
    "from all these results we can conclude that lrm is a convenient and versatile far field optical method for analyzing quantitatively spp propagation on flat film and their interaction with various nano - devices of direct practical interest .",
    "such versatility positions lrm as an appealing alternative to near field optics for studying spp propagation on a scale of , or larger than the wavelength .",
