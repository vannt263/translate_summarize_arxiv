    "in this work , we investigate the probability distribution of the _ shrinking pearson random walk _ in two and greater dimensions , in which the length of the @xmath0 step equals @xmath1 , with @xmath2 . if a walk is at @xmath7 after the @xmath0 step , then @xmath8 is uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath9 centered about @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "we assume that the walk begins at the origin , and the length of the first step is @xmath10 .",
    "the random direction for each step corresponds to the classic pearson walk  @xcite , whose solution is well known when the length of each step is fixed . in this case , the central limit theorem guarantees that the asymptotic probability distribution of endpoints approaches a gaussian function .",
    ".,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in one dimension , the random walk with exponentially shrinking step lengths exhibits a variety of beautiful properties  @xcite . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the support of the endpoint distribution after @xmath12 steps , @xmath13 , is a cantor set , while for @xmath14 the support is the connected interval @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "more interestingly , for @xmath16 and for @xmath17 , @xmath13 is continuous for almost all values of @xmath3 , but is fractal on a complementary and infinite discrete set of @xmath3 values  @xcite .",
    "a particularly striking special case is @xmath18 ( the inverse of the golden ratio ) , where @xmath6 is artistically self - similar on all length scales  @xcite .    shrinking random walks in greater than one dimension are much less studied .",
    "the probability distribution of short pearson walks with a step size that decays as a power law in the number of steps was treated by barkai and silbey  @xcite , while the probability distribution of short pearson walks with arbitrary unequal step sizes was considered by weiss and kiefer  @xcite .",
    "more recently , rador  @xcite studied the moments and various correlations of the probability distribution , and also developed a @xmath19 expansion method , where @xmath20 is the spatial dimension , for pearson walks with shrinking steps .",
    "a physical motivation for this model comes from granular media .",
    "if a granular gas is excited and then allowed to relax to a static state , the motion of a labeled particle is equivalent to a random walk whose steps lengths decrease because of the loss of energy by repeated inelastic collisions .",
    "a related example is an inelastic ball that is bouncing on a vibrating platform  @xcite , where the velocity of the ball after each bounce essentially experiences a random walk with shrinking steps if the vibration is sufficiently weak .",
    "our interest was prompted by m. bazant  @xcite , who apparently introduced the shrinking pearson walk in an mit graduate mathematics course on random walks .",
    "while the distribution of radial displacements , @xmath21 , no longer exhibits self - similar properties , numerical simulations indicated that @xmath21 qualitatively changes shape as a function of @xmath3 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the support of @xmath21 is confined to @xmath23 , and the distribution is peaked near @xmath24 . as @xmath3 increases beyond @xmath25 , the probability of being near the origin increases and @xmath21 eventually exhibits a maximum at the origin when @xmath3 exceeds a critical value , @xmath26 .",
    "for two spatial dimensions , we estimate @xmath26 to be @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution of a single coordinate , @xmath6 , undergoes a similar shape transition , but at a slight different critical value , @xmath28 , that we estimate to be @xmath29 .",
    "more surprisingly , @xmath6 exhibits up to seven local minima and maxima when @xmath30 .",
    "the secondary extrema occur on a very fine scale that can be resolved only by a high - accuracy numerical method , due to van deun and cools  @xcite , to invert the fourier transform of the probability distribution .    in the next section , we present some elementary properties of the shrinking pearson random walk and",
    "show how to obtain the exact fourier transform for the radial and single - coordinate probability distributions . in sec .",
    "iii , we apply the van deun and cools algorithm to numerically invert the fourier transform with high accuracy . from this inversion ,",
    "we outline the behaviors of the radial and single - coordinate probability distributions as a function of @xmath3 in sec .",
    "we briefly discuss the shrinking pearson walk in spatial dimensions @xmath31 in sec .",
    "v and conclude in sec .",
    "when the length of the @xmath0 step decreases exponentially with @xmath12 , the shrinking pearson walk eventually comes to a stop at a finite distance from its starting point .",
    "since the direction of successive steps are uncorrelated , the mean - square displacement after the @xmath0 step , @xmath32 , is given by : @xmath33^{2}\\right >    = [ r_1^{2}+r_2^{2}+r_3^{2}+\\ldots+r_{n}^{2}]\\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\left[1 + \\left(\\lambda\\right)^{2}+(\\lambda^2)^{2}+\\ldots+(\\lambda^{n-1})^{2}\\right ]    = \\frac{1-\\lambda^{2n}}{(1-\\lambda^{2})}\\longrightarrow   \\frac{1}{(1-\\lambda^{2})}\\quad n\\to\\infty.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second line , we use the fact that the directions of different steps are uncorrelated so that the average value of all cross terms in the expansion of @xmath34^{2}$ ] vanish .",
    "we thus obtain the obvious result that @xmath35 grows monotonically with @xmath3 and diverges as @xmath36 , corresponding to the infinite - time limit of the classic pearson random walk .",
    "our interest is in the probability distributions of the radial coordinate and a single cartesian component after @xmath12 steps , @xmath37 and @xmath13 , respectively , as well as their @xmath17 limiting forms , @xmath21 and @xmath6 .",
    "these two distributions undergo a transition from being peaked away from the origin for small @xmath3 , to being peaked at the origin for @xmath3 greater than a critical value . a transition from a unimodal to bimodal probability distribution can be constructed , for example , from brownian motion in media with non - linear shear profiles  @xcite . here",
    "the competition between the flow and diffusion drive the transition . in the prsent example",
    ", the transition is purely statistical in origin .",
    "for the representative case @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 10 steps ( upper left to lower right ) . , scaledwidth=95.0% ]",
    "figure  [ fig : r ] shows the radial distribution for @xmath40 after a small number of steps to provide a sense for the convergence rate to the asymptotic form . for convenience in putting many panels on the same scale",
    ", we typically plot the distribution @xmath41 versus @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the maximal displacement of the infinite walk . already by @xmath44 steps , the probability distribution is visually indistinguishable from its asymptotic form . while @xmath45 varies smoothly as a function of @xmath3 , the position of the global maximum changes _ discontinuously _ from being",
    "peaked at @xmath46 to being peaked at @xmath47 as @xmath3 increase beyond a critical value @xmath26 .",
    "the single - coordinate distribution @xmath6 exhibits a transition from multimodality to unimodality that somewhat resembles the transition for @xmath45 , but is more complex in its microscopic details .",
    "conventionally , the distribution of the displacment factorizes into a product of single - coordinate distribution , from which the radial distribution follows easily .",
    "however , in contrast to the classic pearson walk in which the length of each step is the same , the probability distribution for the shrinking pearson walk no longer factorizes as @xmath48 .",
    "the differences between the radial and single - coordinate distributions arise because there is a non - trivial correlation between steps in orthogonal directions .",
    "if the endpoint of the walk is close to its maximum possible value in , say , the @xmath49-direction , then the displacement in the @xmath50-direction is necessarily small , and _",
    "vice versa_.    it is worth emphasizing that it is not practical to accurately determine the probability distribution of the pearson random walk with shrinking steps by straightforward simulations .",
    "as we shall see , the nature of the transition in @xmath6 is delicate",
    ". it would require a prohibitively large number of walks , or a prohibitively fine spatial grid in an exact enumeration method , to obtain sufficient accuracy to resolve these subtle features .",
    "for this reason , we employ an alternative approach that is based on calculating the fourier transform of the probability distribution  which can be done exactly by elementary methods  and then inverting this transform by the highly accurate van deun and cools  @xcite algorithm .",
    "we first study the distribution of the ( horizontal ) @xmath49 coordinate . to obtain the distribution of @xmath49 after @xmath12 steps , @xmath13 , we start with the chapman - kolmogorov equation  @xcite that relates @xmath13 to @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the probability of making a displacement whose horizontal component equals @xmath54 at the @xmath0 step .",
    "equation   states that to reach a point whose horizontal component equals @xmath49 after @xmath12 steps , the walk must first reach a point with horizontal component @xmath55 in @xmath56 steps and then hop from @xmath55 to @xmath49 at the @xmath0 step .",
    "we now introduce the fourier transforms @xmath57 to recast the convolution in eq .   as the product @xmath58 .",
    "this equation has the formal solution @xmath59 the latter equality applies for a walk that begins at the origin , so that @xmath60 .",
    "now @xmath61 may be obtained by transforming from the uniform distribution of angles to the distribution of the horizontal coordinate in a single step by using the relation @xmath62 together with @xmath63 , to give @xmath64 although the distribution of angles is uniform , the single - step distribution for the @xmath49-coordinate at the @xmath65 step has a `` smile '' appearance , with maxima at @xmath66 and a minimum at @xmath67 .",
    "the probability distribution of the horizontal coordinate after @xmath12 steps is a convolution of these smile functions at different spatial scales .",
    "it is this superposition that gives @xmath6 its rich properties for @xmath68 .",
    "using the transformation between @xmath49 and @xmath69 in eq .  ,",
    "the fourier transform of the single - step probability is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the bessel function of the first kind of order zero .",
    "this result relies on a standard representation of the bessel function as a fourier integral  @xcite .",
    "thus the fourier transform of the probability distribution in eq .",
    "may be expressed as the finite product of bessel functions @xmath72 to calculate @xmath13 requires inverting the fourier transform , @xmath73 where we use the fact that @xmath74 is even in @xmath75 to obtain the second equality .",
    "each of the factors @xmath71 in the product in eq .   is an oscillatory function of @xmath75 , and the product itself oscillates more rapidly as the number of terms @xmath12 increases . the evaluation of integrals with such rapidly oscillating integrands has been the subject of considerable research @xcite ; in particular , integrals of products of bessel functions appear in nuclear physics @xcite , quantum field theory @xcite , scattering theory @xcite , and speech enhancement software @xcite .",
    "recently , van duen and cools  @xcite developed an algorithm that can numerically calculate integrals of power laws multiplied by a product of bessel functions of the first kind quickly and with absolute errors of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "we use their algorithm to compute the probability distribution @xmath13 with this degree of accuracy . to implement their approach , we first write  @xcite @xmath77 to express the right - hand side of eq . in terms of products of bessel functions and a power law only . with this",
    "preliminary , we can directly apply the van duen - cools algorithm to determine @xmath13 accurately .      for the distribution of the radial coordinate @xmath78 , @xmath79 , we again start with the chapman - kolmogorov equation  @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the probability that the walk makes a vector displacement @xmath82 at the @xmath0 step , and we use the angular symmetry of the walk to write @xmath83 as a function of only the magnitude of the displacement . since all angles for the @xmath84 step are equiprobable , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the dirac delta function .",
    "once again , we use the fourier transform to reduce the convolution in eq .   to a product .",
    "this recursion has the solution @xmath87 with the last equality appropriate for a walk that starts from the origin . while eqs .   and are identical , the corresponding distributions in real space are distinct . to obtain @xmath79 , we must calculate @xmath88 since @xmath89 is a function of the magnitude of @xmath90 only , we can write the integration in polar coordinates and perform the angular integration to obtain the spherically symmetric result @xmath91 in this bessel product form , we can again apply the van duen - cools algorithm  @xcite to invert this fourier transform numerically .",
    "we numerically integrate eq .   by the van duen",
    "- cools algorithm to give the single - coordinate probability distribution @xmath13 whose evolution as a function of @xmath3 is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . notice that there is a value @xmath92 for which the curvature at the origin vanishes .",
    "however , at this value of @xmath3 the global maximum of the @xmath6 is not at the origin .",
    "thus points where @xmath93 do not help locate the global extrema of the probability distribution and we must resort to the numerical integration .    since the individual step lengths decay exponentially with @xmath12",
    ", the finite-@xmath12 distribution @xmath13 quickly converges to its asymptotic @xmath17 form .",
    "for example , for @xmath38 ( close to @xmath28 ) , the displacement of the walk after 15 steps is within @xmath94 of its final endpoint .",
    "hence the probability distribution is visually indistinguishable from the asymptotic distribution on the scale of the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : x ] .",
    "we always use values of @xmath12 for each @xmath3 to ensure that @xmath95 is within @xmath94 of its final displacement .     for increasing @xmath3 near @xmath4 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "for @xmath96 the curvature at the origin becomes positive , while at @xmath97 the location of the maximum in @xmath6 changes discontinuously . for @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath6 approaches a gaussian.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for small @xmath3 , @xmath6 resembles the smile distribution of the single - step distribution in eq .  .",

    "we see that the small maximum that is born when @xmath3 passes through approximately 0.5565 ( fig .",

    "a peak gradually develops at the origin , while the peak @xmath46 gradually recedes as @xmath3 increases .",
    "thus as @xmath3 passes through @xmath26 , the location of the global peak of @xmath45 discontinuously jumps to zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] ) .",
    "we do not find evidence of fine - scale anomalies in the radial distribution as @xmath3 passes through @xmath26 .",
    "the approach developed for two dimensions can be straightforwardly extended to higher spatial dimensions . for the radial distribution in @xmath20 dimensions , the single - step distribution @xmath114 is now @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the surface area of the unit hypersphere in @xmath20 dimensions and @xmath117 is the radial distance .",
    "the corresponding fourier transform is  @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",

    "the same formal approach can be used to calculate the distribution @xmath6 .",

    "consequently , the convolution of these single - step distributions leads to @xmath13 having a single peak at the origin .",
    "we investigated the shrinking pearson walk , where each step is in a random direction , while the length of the @xmath65 step is @xmath126 , with @xmath2 .",
    "because the step lengths are not identical , one of the defining conditions for the central limit theorem is violated .",
    "consequently , there is no reason to expect that the probability distribution for this walk is gaussian .",
    "we studied basic properties of the radial probability distribution , @xmath45 , and the distribution of a single coordinate , @xmath6 .",

    "the @xmath45 and @xmath6 are distinct distributions .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the radial probability distribution of the shrinking pearson walk changes from being peaked away from the origin to being peaked at the origin as the shrinking factor @xmath3 increases beyond a critical value @xmath26 .",
    "as this transition in @xmath3 is passed , the location of the peak changes discontinuously from a non - zero value to @xmath47 . in greater than two dimensions",
    ", there is a similar shape transition in the radial distribution , but now the location of the only peak goes to zero continuously as @xmath3 increases beyond @xmath26 .",
    "the single - coordinate distribution @xmath6 has peculiar features for the specific case of two dimensions .",
    "visually , @xmath6 becomes nearly flat at the origin for @xmath127 ( middle panel , bottom row of fig .",

    "however , at a higher degree of magnification , this nearly flat portion of the distribution exhibits fine - scale oscillations , with up to seven local extrema .",
    "because additional oscillations can be resolved as the resolution is increased , it is tempting to speculate that arbitrarily many oscillations occur at progressively decreasing scales . to test for this possibility ,",
    "we computed the first derivative @xmath128 from eq .  , and looked for additional zeros in @xmath128 as a function of @xmath49 . again employing the van duen - cools algorithm , we find the @xmath13 is strictly positive for @xmath49 in the range @xmath129 to @xmath130 when @xmath131 , but is strictly negative in the same range of @xmath49 when @xmath132 .",
