    "in this article we consider the propagation of a stationary coherent wave described by a field @xmath0 , in a nonlinear elastically scattering medium . though we believe that our results are of a general character , for the sake of concreteness we consider the situation where the wave is described by a nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the density",
    ", @xmath3 is the wave mass , @xmath4 is the wave energy , @xmath5 is a constant and @xmath6 is a scattering potential , which is a random function of the coordinates .",
    "eq.1 appears , for example , in the theory of electromagnetic waves propagating in nonlinear media @xcite , in the theory of hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , and in the theory of turbulent plasma @xcite .",
    "we will assume that @xmath6 obays the white noise statistics : @xmath7 , @xmath8 . here",
    "brackets @xmath9 correspond to averaging over realizations of @xmath6 , and @xmath10 is the elastic mean free path ( @xmath11 ) . in the presence of the scattering potential @xmath6 ,",
    "the spatial dependence of the @xmath12 exhibits random sample - specific fluctuations , which are called speckles . in the case of elastically scattering diffusive linear media",
    "this problem was considered in @xcite . below we will be interested in the statistics of @xmath12 in the case of nonlinear diffusive media . in particular",
    ", we will show that , for given boundary conditions , the number of solutions of eq.1 increases exponentially with sample size .",
    "a brief summary of some of the results has been published in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the case where a coherent wave @xmath13 with momentum @xmath14 is incident on a disordered sample of size @xmath15 ( see the insert in fig.1a ) .",
    "the @xmath16-dependence of the average density @xmath17 can be described by the diffusion equation , @xmath18 which is equivalent the to calculation of the diagrams shown in fig.2.a . here",
    "@xmath19 is the current density . in the limit",
    "@xmath20 the expression for the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 has a classical form . in the case of the geometry shown in fig.1 ,",
    "the total flux through the sample is zero , and the average density @xmath22 is spatially uniform .",
    "the term @xmath23 in eq.1 plays the role of an additional scattering potential .",
    "it will be shown that its contribution to the diffusion coefficient @xmath24 can be neglected at small enough intensities of the incident beam , when @xmath25 at @xmath26 the propagation of a uniform wave in an infinite medium described by eq.1 is unstable at arbitrarily small @xmath27 due to the effect of nonlinear self focusing .",
    "the characteristic length at which the self - focusing takes place is of order @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "thus the inequality eq.3 is equivalent to @xmath29 .",
    "one can say that the regime eq.3 corresponds to a system of randomly distributed weak concave and convex lenses .",
    "the diffusion equation approximation completely neglects interference effects , which lead to the existence of speckles . to describe them one should solve eq.1 before averaging over the realizations of @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to expand the density @xmath30 in a complete set of orthonormal eigenstates @xmath31 of the diffusion equation @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the eigenvalues of eq.5 , and @xmath35 labels the eigenstates",
    ". we will show below why the expansion eq.4 is convenient .",
    "we assume boundary conditions corresponding to zero current through a closed boundary , and @xmath36 at the open boundary .",
    "let us first substitute eq.4 into the nonlinear term of eq.1 , and regard the @xmath37 as independent parameters .",
    "this gives a linear equation for @xmath0 @xmath38 denoting a solution of eq.6 at a given set of parameters @xmath39 , as @xmath40 and constructing latexmath:[$n({\\bf r } , \\",
    "{ u({\\bf r}\\ } ) , \\{\\bar{u}_{i}\\})=    self - consistency equations for @xmath39 : @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are dimensionless random functions of @xmath39 , the form of which depends on @xmath6 .",
    "to investigate the properties of the solutions of eq.7 , we have to know the statistical properties of the random functions @xmath45 .",
    "we can infer these properties from values of different correlation functions of @xmath45 obtained by averaging over realizations of @xmath46 .",
    "it is important that the statistical analysis of the random functions @xmath47 is equivalent to the analysis of linear speckles , which has been done in @xcite . to characterize @xmath48",
    "we calculate the following correlation functions @xmath49 @xmath50^{2}\\rangle \\sim ( \\delta\\bar{u}_{n})^{2 } \\qquad at \\qquad \\delta \\bar{u}_{i}\\sim 1.\\ ] ] @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53 which is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "we present the derivation of eqs.10 - 12 in the next section . the simple form of eqs.10 - 12 is a consequency of the choice of @xmath54 in eqs.4,5 .",
    "eq.10 indicates that mesoscopic fluctuations of different functions @xmath55 are uncorrelated . according to eq.12 ,",
    "the correlation of derivatives of @xmath48 over different @xmath56 is small for @xmath57 .",
    "it will be shown in the next section that these facts are consequences of the choice of @xmath31 in eq.4 as eigenfunctions of eq.5 .",
    "the introduction of the coefficients @xmath58 in eq.4 ensures eqs.10,11 appears as above .",
    "thus we arrive at the following picture : the @xmath48 fluctuate randomly as functions of @xmath39 near their average , which is independent of @xmath39 . according to eq.11 ,",
    "the characteristic period of the fluctuations is of order one .",
    "the fluctuations both of different functions , and the same functions with respect to different @xmath59 are uncorrelated .    using this information about the @xmath60 we can estimate the number of solutions of eq.7 ( or eq.1 ) . if @xmath61 , eq.7 has a unique solution while for @xmath62 eq.7 has many solutions .",
    "let us consider the @xmath63 equation in eq.7 and fix all variables @xmath64 other than @xmath59 .",
    "then , at @xmath65 the equation has a unique solution , while at @xmath66 the number of the solutions is of order @xmath67 . in fig.1a",
    "we show a qualitative graphical solution of eq.7 , which corresponds to the intersection of two functions : @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the solutions are distributed in an interval of order @xmath67 .    therefore , to estimate number of solutions of eqs.7 at @xmath62",
    ", we have to take into account only a subset of eqs.7 with @xmath70 .",
    "since both the amplitude of fluctuations and the periods in the @xmath63 direction of randomly rippled hypersurfaces @xmath48 are of order unity , the number of solutions @xmath71 of eqs.1,7 is proportional to the volume of an @xmath72-dimensional hyperparallelepiped with sides of order @xmath67 , @xmath73 . as a result",
    "we have @xmath74 thus the number of the solutions @xmath71 of eq.1 increases exponentially with the sample size @xmath75 .    to illustrate eq.13 we consider the case @xmath76 ( @xmath77 )",
    ". then eqs.7 can be viewed as two surfaces @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which are intersected by two planes @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "a result of these intersections is two systems of lines in the plane @xmath82 shown in fig.1b .",
    "the solid lines correspond to intersections between @xmath78 and @xmath80 , and are located within a strip in the @xmath83 direction of width of order @xmath84 .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the intersection of the surfaces @xmath85 and @xmath81 , and are located within a strip of width @xmath86 in @xmath87 direction .",
    "the intersections of solid and dashed lines in fig.1b correspond to solutions of the system of eqs.7 . according to eqs.10 - 12 ,",
    "the dashed and the solid lines in fig.1b are uncorrelated .",
    "the typical distance between , say , solid lines is of order one . as a result ,",
    "the number of solutions @xmath88 of eqs.7 in this case is of the order of the area of a parallelogram with sides @xmath84 and @xmath89 @xmath90    now let us estimate the corrections to the diffusion coefficients originating from scattering from the potential @xmath91 . in the case",
    "@xmath92 we have ( @xmath93 ) @xcite @xmath94 independently of the values of the parameters @xmath39 . in the born approximation ,",
    "the nonlinear mean free path corresponding to scattering from the potential @xmath91 is :    @xmath95    thus the criterion eq.3 is equivalent to @xmath96 .    in the opposite limit @xmath97 ,",
    "the scattering mean free path is determined by the scattering from the potential @xmath91 , and one can neglect the random potential @xmath6 in eq.1 . in this case",
    "one can estimate the number of solutions of eq.1 by substituting @xmath98 instead of @xmath10 into eqs.8 , or by substituting @xmath99 into eq.13 instead of @xmath84 , where @xmath100    in the conclusion of this section we would like to discuss the condition @xmath101 for the existence of multiple solutions of eq.1 . in the absence of the nonlinear term @xmath91",
    "the solution of eq.1 corresponds to particles traveling along diffusion trajectories . in the presence of the nonlinear term @xmath91",
    ", the probability amplitude for traveling along a diffusive trajectory acquires an additional phase of order @xmath102 , where the integration is taken along a diffusive trajectory . to estimate the value of the additional phase",
    "let us calculate the integral @xmath103 the correlation function of densities is given by eq.15 and the estimate for eq.18 is @xmath104 .",
    "thus the criterion @xmath105 corresponds to @xmath106 .",
    "another interpretation is that at @xmath105 the sensitivity of the solutions of eq.1 to a change of @xmath6 increases significantly as compared to its single particle value @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the calculation of correlation functions eqs.10 - 12 . according to the definition eq.9 we get @xmath107 in the approximation eq.3 ,",
    "the value of @xmath108 is independent of @xmath109 and has the same form as in the linear case @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can use the standard diagram technique for averaging over @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the diagrams describing the correlation functions @xmath110 are shown in fig.2b , c .",
    "alternatively , one can solve the langevin equation @xcite , valid at @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 the correlation function of random langevin forces @xmath114 is given by the diagram shown in fig.2b .",
    "it can be written as @xmath115 the expression for @xmath116 is given by the ladder diagrams shown in fig.2b , where the inner green function correspond to @xmath39 , while the outer green functions correspond to @xmath117 .",
    "eq.22 is a generalization of corresponding equations introduced in @xcite .",
    "namely , in the case @xmath118 one has to substitute @xmath119 in eq.22 instead of @xmath120 .",
    "using eqs.20 - 22 we get @xmath121 @xmath122 here @xmath123 is the green s function of eq.5 .    at @xmath124 ,",
    "doing the integral over @xmath125 in eq.23 by parts , using eq.22 and taking into account the orthogonality of the functions @xmath54 , we get eq.10 .",
    "the diagrams in fig.2.b for @xmath126 are equivalent to the equation @xcite @xmath127 the existence of the term proportional to @xmath128 in eq.25 reflects the fact that the inner lines in the diagrams shown in fig.2b correspond to the green s functions in the scattering potential characterized by @xmath39 while the outer lines correspond to those of @xmath129 .",
    "note that as long as eq.3 holds eq.25 is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "solving eq.25 by perturbation theory with respect to @xmath130 we get @xmath131    we can neglect the second term in brackets in eq.26 because it is of order @xmath132 ( and its contribution to eq.22 is of order @xmath133 ) , while the contribution to eq.22 from the third term is @xmath134 . to get the latter estimate we took into account that @xmath135 at @xmath136 .",
    "substituting eq.26 into eq.19,22,23 , we get eqs.11,12 .",
    "the estimate eq.14 was made for the case of a typical realization of the scattering potential .",
    "on the other hand , even at @xmath137 , there are rare realizations of @xmath6 , which correspond to several solutions of eq.1 .      at @xmath62 , the solutions of eq.1 exhibit exponentially large sensitivity to changes of parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the case where the incident angle @xmath139 of the wave is changing , and suppose that a solution of eq.1 follows this change adiabatically .",
    "then an exponentially small change @xmath140 will lead to disappearance of the solution , and the system will jump to another solution .",
    "similar phenomenon may occur in the system of interacting electrons is disordered metals : it can be unstable with respect to the creation of random magnetic moments .",
    "this would correspond to finkelshtain s scenario @xcite .",
    "however , in this case in order to get a self - consistency equation , which would be an analog of eq.7 , we have to integrate over electron energies , which decreases the amplitude of mesoscopic fluctuations . as a result",
    ", the situation with many solutions may occur only in the d=2 case and the characteristic spatial scale will be of the order of the electron localization length in the linear problem .",
    "thus the problem of interacting electrons in disordered metals remains unsolved .",
    "we would like to mention a similarity of the problem considered above to the problem of spin glasses . to illustrate this point",
    "let us consider a model in which the coefficient @xmath141 in eq.1 is nonzero only at points @xmath142 , @xmath143 @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a short range function decaying on characteristic distance @xmath146 , and of a maximum height @xmath147 , and @xmath148 are randomly distributed in space with given density .",
    "then eq.1 can be rewritten only in terms of values of @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the green function of the linear schrdinger equation , and the phase @xmath153 is a random quantity at @xmath154 . the major difference between eq.30 and the spin glass problem is that in the former case one is interested in the minimum of the free energy , while in the case of eq.30 the boundary conditions are given .",
    "thus there are no thermodynamic criteria on how to choose between multiple solutions of the stationary eq.1 .",
    "one of the possibilities is that the state of the system is determined by its history .",
    "we may question how many of these stationary states are stable",
    ". the time - dependent non - linear schrdinger equation may be obtained from eq.1 by substituting @xmath4 for @xmath155 .",
    "equivalently , we can write equations for @xmath156 . we still assume the same stationary boundary conditions . in the absence of a complete solution we present a qualitative picture .",
    "the characteristic time of change of the @xmath157 harmonic @xmath59 is @xmath158 .",
    "thus we have @xmath159 here @xmath160 is a dimensionless random function .",
    "the statistical properties of the function @xmath161 are roughly the same as those for @xmath48 .",
    "namely , the amplitude and sign randomly oscillate with a characteristic periods of order one .",
    "strictly speaking , eq.31 holds if @xmath162 and the characteristic time of establishing stationary distributions @xmath12 at given @xmath156 is much shorter than the characteristic time of change of @xmath156 .",
    "in other words , eqs.31 represent a sort of hydrodynamics .",
    "this takes place , for example , near the critical instability points ( see , for example , the point @xmath163 on fig1.a . ) .",
    "generally , @xmath164 , so we have to keep not only the first but also several higher time derivatives in eqs.31 .",
    "we believe , however , that the model eqs.31 captures the qualitative features of the system s dynamics correctly even in this case .",
    "linearizing eqs.31 near the stationary solutions , we arrive at the conclusion that the fraction of solutions of eq.7 which are stable is of order @xmath165 .",
    "thus , at @xmath62 the number of stable stationary solutions is still exponentially large .    in principle",
    ", eqs.31 can also have nonstationary solutions as @xmath166 .",
    "obviously , the characteristic amplitudes of the solutions are given by eq.7 , ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "a complete investigation of @xmath168 is a complicated and still unsolved problem .",
    "for example , for @xmath169 and @xmath166 only stable stationary solutions are relevant . for @xmath76 , and @xmath166 ,",
    "depending on the properties of the realizations of the random sample specific functions @xmath170 and @xmath171 , one can , additionally , have periodic , quasiperiodic , and chaoric in time solutions . if @xmath172 , one can also , have strange ( or stochastic ) attractors as solutions of three differential equations .",
    "in this respect we would like to mention papers @xcite , where an attempt to describe temporal nonlinear speckles was done .",
    "we believe that these results are incorrect . to estimate the instability threshold it is sufficient to expand the nonlinear langevin equations in powers of @xmath5 ( see diagrams shown in fig.2 in @xcite , or in fig.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is why the authors of @xcite were able to reproduce the instability criterion @xmath101 obtained in @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , this approach holds only in the case when @xmath61 . for @xmath173",
    "this approach describes the system incorrectly . in the absence of solid mathematical procedure",
    "the authors of @xcite made assumptions about the nature of solutions of eq.1 beyond the instability point @xmath105 .",
    "namely , they made assumptions that at @xmath166 the finction @xmath174 must exhibit oscillations in time and they assumed some form of time correlations of @xmath175 .",
    "both assumptions are incorrect .",
    "this can be seen , for example , from the fact that their approach can not reproduce the existence of an exponentially big ( for @xmath62 ) number of multiple stationary solutions of eqs.7 , which are singular points of eqs.31 .",
    "the simplest situation where the deficiency of the approach of @xmath176 is most evident takes place near the first instability point @xmath177 .",
    "this is schematically shown by the dashed line in fig.1a .",
    "the critical value @xmath178 is sample specific . in this case , say , the first equation @xmath179 in the system of eqs.7 has three solutions .",
    "two of them are close to each other ( see the point `` a '' in fig.1a . ) .",
    "let us start with a discussion of the system dynamics near this point .",
    "we would like to stress that in this case @xmath180 and our analysis is rigorous .",
    "this is exactly the regime considered in @xcite . since @xmath181 for @xmath182",
    ", we can neglect the time derivatives in all equations of the system eqs.31 , except the one with @xmath183 .",
    "moreover , since this point of instability is a rare one , all equations in eqs.7 with @xmath182 have unique solutions .",
    "thus , the system s dynamics is described by just one first order differential equation for @xmath83 . near the point @xmath163 in fig.1a the functions @xmath161 and @xmath184 change slowly .",
    "thus , one stationary solution is stable and the other is unstable .",
    "the solution indicated by the letter `` b '' in fig.1a is also stable because it is related adiabatically to the unique stable solution for @xmath185 . at @xmath166",
    "the system approaches one of the stable stationary solutions , described by eqs.7 @xcite .",
    "thus the assumption made in @xcite about existence of oscillating in time solutions near the critical point is wrong .",
    "far from the critical point , when @xmath186 and the number of relevant equations of the system of eqs.31 is larger than one , depending on initial conditions and the form of random functions @xmath187 , eqs.31 can have periodic , chaotic solutions and strange attractors , in addition to stationary points .",
    "the fractions of the phase space which at @xmath188 are attracted to these types of motion are currently not known . in any case , the solutions of the time - dependent nonlinear schrdinger equation , or eqs.31 , have a very complicated non - gaussian character , which is very different from that assumed in @xcite .    finally , we would like to mention that in reality , in the case of very large @xmath71 , the time dependent fluctuations of external sources become important .",
    "they are not described by eq.1 and the problem remains unsolved .",
