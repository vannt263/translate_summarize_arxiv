    "one of the most important questions in cosmology is how galaxies are formed and evolved in the context of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe . to answer the question ,",
    "it is essential to search for young galaxies at high - redshift systematically and to study their observational properties in detail . in the hierarchical structure formation scenario of the cdm universe , the first bright objects and/or the first galaxies are predicted to be formed in about some hundreds myrs after the big bang ( i.e. , redshift @xmath3 ) and to be embedded in the deep gravitational potential wells of the cdm ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "they are expected to be luminous at the line @xcite because the strong ionizing radiation from young massive stars in the galaxies should lead to prominent emission through the recombination of hydrogen in their interstellar medium .    in this decade ,",

    "recently , the galaxies beyond redshift 6 have been frequently detected by their prominent emission with faint continuum ( emitters [ laes ] ) by using ground - based large telescopes like subaru @xcite , keck @xcite and vlt @xcite .",
    "moreover , surprisingly , the possible detection of a redshift @xmath3 galaxy is reported by @xcite , although this is still controversial @xcite . in the following decade , next generation space telescopes like the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( jwst ) are launched .",
    "the expected limiting @xmath4 flux of jwst for a point source reaches to njy - level ( @xmath5 ) in the wavelength range of @xmath6 ; this range corresponds to the redshifted wavelength at the source redshift of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it seems to be in not - so - distant future that the emission from the first galaxies and/or the laes beyond redshift of 10 are firmly detected .",
    "however , before the era of cosmological reionization , these first galaxies should be surrounded by plentiful neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ; we call this `` halo '' from now on . for completely neutral universe , typical scattering optical depth for the photons escaped from the galaxies at redshift about 10",
    "is estimated to be @xmath0 by using the standard cosmological parameters .",
    "one might be discouraged by the extremely high optical depth for the photons , but it has been shown that most of them can escape from the halo around a source at young universe and travel freely toward the observer @xcite .",
    "the reasons are as follows : ( 1 ) photons are not destroyed in the intergalactic space because free - electrons and dust as sources of the two - photon decay and the ultraviolet continuum absorption , respectively , rarely exist in the igm in such early universe ; ( 2 ) in the halo , which is assumed to expand following the pure cosmological hubble flow , the photons are scattered many times and diffused redward in wavelength ; at last , cumulative scattering redshift grows large enough to escape from the halo .",
    "the hierarchical structure formation scenario of the cdm universe indicates that the first galaxies are formed at high - density peak regions in the cdm distribution . in such regions , the cdm structures",
    "are predicted to be filamentary by numerical n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the underlying cdm filament may affect the halos around them by gravitational attraction force .",
    "it is naturally expected that the gravity works anisotropically ; it is the strongest in direction perpendicular to the axis of the cdm filament ( @xmath8-direction ) , while it is the weakest along the axis direction ( @xmath9-direction ) .",
    "this situation around one of the first galaxies is illustrated schematically in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "considering such situation , we assume an improved expansion law to the halo in our previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kk04 in short ) ( _ spheroidal expansion law _ ; see equation ( [ eq1 ] ) below ) : the halo expands following a pure hubble expansion in @xmath9-direction , while it is decelerated to some extent from the pure hubble flow in @xmath8-direction .",
    "we have investigated the effects of the anisotropic expansion of the halo to the line profiles and luminosities of the first galaxies in kk04 .",
    "we have found the following two effects : ( 1 ) the peak of the line is redshifted to longer wavelength ; ( 2 ) the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the line is broadened to wider than those of the isotropic expansion model to the halo . since the fwhm corresponds to the doppler width at the temperature of @xmath10 , it has been predicted that no intrinsic line features of the first galaxies appear .",
    "as deceleration against the hubble expansion by the gravity of the filament becomes strong , these two effects result in less luminosity of the diffuse emission line .",
    "furthermore , as expected from the anisotropy in the expansion of the halo , the line profile has dependence on the direction from which the source galaxy is observed .",
    "clarifying such dependence is essential to discuss the detectability of emission lines from the first galaxies .",
    "the dependence can be studied by dividing the solid angle around the source into some regions and by investigating the line profile in each region .",
    "however , we have not been able to examine the dependence in kk04 to keep the high statistical reliance of the numerical solution in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "this is because the following reason : in a monte carlo simulation , the convergence of the solution needs to be checked by increasing the number of test photons , but the total number of test photons has been restricted by the weak computational power to @xmath11 in kk04 .",
    "we have improved the numerical code to solve the transfer problem with larger number of test photons than @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , this is the time to revisit the line transfer problem in the anisotropically expanding halo with the improved numerical code .    in this paper",
    ", we reexamine the line transfer problem with 10 times larger number of test photons than that of kk04 . in  2 , followed by kk04 , we summarize the formalism of the line transfer problem in an expanding halo and discuss about the model of the halo . our numerical results such as line profiles , apparent line luminosities , and typical angular sizes of the first galaxies in emission observed from the @xmath9- and @xmath8-directions are shown in  3 .",
    "then , in  4 , we give the flux of the source with intrinsic line luminosity of @xmath13 , and discuss the expected signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for the source in the case of the observation by the jwst .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in  5 .",
    "we adopt the _ wmap _ cosmological parameters in the whole calculations of this paper , that is , @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "as briefly described in introduction , we have formulated a line transfer problem in kk04 according to @xcite , setting a simple assumption to the expansion law of halo , that is , _ spheroidal expansion law _ :",
    "@xmath16^{1/2 } ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is recession velocity , @xmath18 is the hubble expansion rate at the photon source redshift of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the asphericity or the decreasing rate of the recession velocity in @xmath8-direction ( @xmath21 plane ) to the pure hubble expansion . in other words , this parameter @xmath20 represents the relative intensity of the gravitational attraction force by the underlying cdm filament to the cosmological hubble expansion .",
    "we choose the parameter of @xmath20 as a free parameter from 1.0 ( corresponds to the pure hubble expansion in all directions ) to 0.3 with a step of 0.1 .",
    "as noted in kk04 , @xmath20 is assumed to be a single value globally for simplicity , although it should have different values depending on the distance from the cdm filament and approach to unity as leaving the galaxy far behind .",
    "this assumption can be hold because of the following reason .",
    "the properties of escaping photons are determined essentially at a position where the optical depth for the photons decreases to about unity and where the physical distance from the source galaxy is @xmath22 .",
    "the characteristic proper distance of @xmath23 is a function of @xmath20 and gradually increases from 1.0 to 2.9 mpc as @xmath20 decreases from 1.0 to 0.3 .",
    "the gravity of the underlying cdm filament can affect this region even at the early universe @xcite .",
    "let @xmath24 , , ) be the specific intensity of a line ( in photons @xmath25 ) , where @xmath26 is comoving frequency , @xmath8 is radial vector from the source galaxy , and @xmath27 is direction cosine vector .",
    "the comoving transfer equation for a line with the assumption of isotropic coherent scattering is given by @xmath28 here , @xmath26 is the redshift of the frequency @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the resonant frequency of and @xmath31 is the photon frequency ; @xmath32 is the scattering opacity at the frequency redshift @xmath26 ( the analytical form is represented in kk04 ) ; @xmath33 is the mean intensity ; @xmath34 is the emission function ; @xmath35 is the increasing rate of the frequency redshift per unit distance in the @xmath9-direction ( i.e. the direction in which the medium in a halo follows the pure hubble expansion ) ; and @xmath36^{1/2 } ,    \\label{eq - def_psi}\\ ] ] represents the effect of the anisotropic expansion of a halo where @xmath37 is the @xmath9-axis component of direction cosine .",
    "the source function on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq - lya_trans ] ) can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the steady emission rate of photons by the source ( in photons @xmath40 ) and assumed to be constant .    in the whole calculation in this paper , we assume that a steady point source galaxy at redshift 10 which lit up before the cosmological reionization is surrounded by a uniform , completely neutral igm . in other words , we assume that the reionization epoch is redshift @xmath41 , which is intermediate between the late epoch of @xmath42 @xcite and the early epoch of @xmath43 @xcite . apparently , the assumption of completely neutral igm at redshift @xmath3 is oversimplified since a local cosmological region can spread over the source of photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the so - called `` proximity effect '' is important for quasars but is less so for galaxies , the typical sizes of the regions around source galaxies are expected to be not much less than @xmath44 proper mpc , which is comparable to the size of the scattering region discussing in this paper @xcite .",
    "so there simply must be a phase when regions around early galaxies are becoming larger than the surrounding filaments ; our results can hold prior to the phase . fortunately ,",
    "as shown in kk04 , the line profiles of the first galaxies at redshift @xmath45 , which are considered to be in such phase , are analogous with those of sources at redshift 10 shown in this paper . however , some corrections for the model assumed in this paper due to the regions around sources and the density fluctuations in halo may be necessary .    our calculation algorithm is identical with that of kk04 .",
    "avoiding redundancy , we only summarize the monte - carlo technique used in the calculations here ( see  2 and  3 of kk04 for the details ) . at first , according to an initial frequency redshift of test photons from the line center , the initial distances of them from the source are determined stochastically by means of the diffusion solution of @xcite .",
    "the tentative optical depth @xmath46 for a test photon is determined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a random number between 0 and 1 , and the photon proceeds the distance proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "once @xmath49 , we say that the photon escapes from the halo . during scattering events ,",
    "the frequency redshift of a photon is increased according to the value of @xmath50 .",
    "these procedures are repeated until all test photons escape from the halo .",
    "the total number of the test photons @xmath51 is @xmath52 , which is ten times larger than that of kk04 .",
    "thanks to the increase of calculating photon number and the improvement of our numerical code , we can divide the whole solid angle into @xmath53 regions with almost the same statistical precision as that of kk04 .",
    "these regions are selected to have the same solid angle of @xmath54 and to be axi - symmetric around the filament axis .",
    "thus , it can be discussed meaningfully how much the line profiles and the apparent line luminosities of the first galaxies depend on the direction from which they are observed .",
    "we adopt @xmath55 and @xmath56 for all calculations shown in this paper .",
    "first , we define the line profile per unit wavelength per unit solid angle ( in @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 , as the following equation : @xmath59 }    { n_\\mathrm{tot}\\cdot \\left[hc/\\left(1+z_s\\right )              \\lambda_{\\alpha}\\right ] } ,    \\label{eq - def_till}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the number of escaping photons with the observed wavelength and solid angle in ranges of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ; @xmath63 is the resonant wavelength of in the rest - frame . the characteristic quantity on the denominator of the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq - def_till ] ) represents the initial total energy of the test photons in the observer frame .",
    "therefore , the integrated value of over the whole wavelength and solid angle becomes unity only if the wavelength redshifts caused by scattering in expanding halos are negligible .      before we investigate the dependence of the observed line profile and apparent line luminosity of the first galaxies on viewing angles to them , we show the characteristic effects of the anisotropic expansion of a halo to the emission line according to kk04 . for this purpose , here we define two tentative quantities : _ mean line profile _ and _ scattered line luminosity _ , denoted by and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "we emphasize here that they are not observational quantities except for those with @xmath65 but make the effects of the anisotropic expansion of a halo clear .",
    "for a certain @xmath20 , is obtained by counting the number of test photons with the observed wavelength in range of @xmath66 without distinction among escape directions , @xmath67 : @xmath68\\cdot \\left[hc/\\lambda \\right ] }   { n_\\mathrm{tot}\\cdot \\left[hc/\\left(1+z_s\\right)\\lambda \\right]}.\\ ] ] note that is obtainable without knowing each line profile which is observed from a viewing angle .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents the mean line profiles for the various values of the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the solid , long - dashed , short - dashed , dotted , long dash - dotted lines are @xmath69 ( the hubble expansion ) , 0.9 , 0.7 , 0.5 , and 0.3 , respectively . as @xmath20 decreases , the wavelength at which has its peak value , @xmath70 , becomes longer as well as the peak value itself becomes lower ; as a result , becomes more diffuse in wavelength .",
    "these lines are well in agreement with the results of kk04 .",
    "the scattered line luminosity normalized by the total energy of the test photons in the observer frame , @xmath64 , is obtained by the product of the integral of over the whole wavelength and the whole solid angle @xmath71 : @xmath72 this represents the total energy fraction of the scattered line to the intrinsic one and therefore the value of is always lower than ( or perhaps equal to ) unity .",
    "recall that this is not an observational quantity for that with @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are selected to be @xmath76 ( @xmath77 where @xmath55 ) and @xmath78 , respectively ; this wavelength range covers almost all photons escaped from the halo .",
    "the results of are listed at the 7th column in table [ tab1 ] for some @xmath20 .",
    "one can see that is always lower than unity and slightly decreases as @xmath20 decreases .      here",
    "we present the numerical results of _ observed line profiles _ and _ apparent line luminosities _ of the first galaxies in order to investigate the dependence of them on viewing angles .",
    "first , we consider the observed line profiles of two characteristic cases ; one can be seen from @xmath9-direction and the other from @xmath8-direction denoted by and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "these are obtained by integrating over the representative solid angle of @xmath80 , and then , by multiplying the integrated value by a factor of @xmath81 .",
    "we note here that , for @xmath69 , and completely correspond with each other and with @xmath82 .",
    "the results are depicted in figure [ fig3 ] for @xmath83 ( _ thick _ and _ thin solid lines _ ) and @xmath84 ( _ thick _ and _ thin dashed lines _ ) ; the thick and thin lines are and @xmath85 , respectively . for @xmath69",
    "is also shown ( _ dash - dotted line _ ) for reference .",
    "one can see that , at the whole range of the observed wavelength , with a certain @xmath20 has always larger value than that of with the same @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , rapidly fades down as @xmath20 decreases , while does nt .",
    "the characteristic quantities of the observed line profiles ( i.e. , @xmath70 and the fwhm ) are summarized in table [ tab1 ] . at the 2nd and 3rd columns , @xmath70 of and with various parameters of @xmath20",
    "are compiled , respectively .",
    "it is shown that @xmath70 of is redshifted to longer wavelength than that of with the same @xmath20 .",
    "the 4th and 5th columns present the fwhms of and @xmath85 , respectively , and the 6th column shows the ratio of the fwhms of to @xmath79 . these indicate that is always wider than with the same @xmath20 and that the difference among them grows further as @xmath20 decreases . for convenience , we also give the measure of the observed flux per unit wavelength , @xmath86 , on the right - hand side of the vertical axis in figure [ fig3 ] ( in @xmath87 ) , which is defined by @xmath88 here , @xmath89 is luminosity distance from the observer to the source redshift @xmath19 . for @xmath55 which we adopt in this paper as the redshift of the emission source , @xmath90 is @xmath91 cm ( @xmath92 gpc ) . we apply a typical line luminosity of high - redshift laes of @xmath93 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a reference luminosity of the source at @xmath55 ; this is based on the fact that the luminosity function of laes in the redshift from 3 to 6 does not significantly change @xcite .",
    "the expected jwst limiting @xmath4 flux for a point source of 1 njy to the source at redshift 10 with intrinsic line luminosities of @xmath94 is also presented by contours in figure [ fig3 ] ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the apparent line luminosities can be obtained by integrating the observed line profile in a certain range of wavelength and by multiplying the integrated value by a factor of @xmath71 like in equation ( [ eq - def_lum ] ) .",
    "this multiplication of the whole solid angle reflects that , when a source at @xmath55 is observed , the line luminosity is estimated under the assumption that the emission from the source is isotropic with the observed flux density .",
    "thus , this apparent line luminosity coincides with the scattered line luminosity only in the case that the photons isotropically escape from the halo . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the integral interval from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , assuming the source is observed with a tentative narrow - band filter centered at @xmath97 with a bandwidth of @xmath98 .",
    "then , we can obtain the apparent line luminosities of and for and @xmath99 , respectively . and are listed at the 8th and 9th column in table [ tab1 ] , respectively , and their ratio is given at the last column . compared with at the same @xmath20 ,",
    "is always brighter .",
    "as @xmath20 decreases , rapidly decreases while remains high value ; therefore , the ratio of to increases and results in the factor of @xmath100 for @xmath101 .      our results also indicate that emissions from the first galaxies are no longer point sources but diffuse on the sky ; this agrees with the result of the previous work by @xcite .",
    "this means that the surface brightnesses of the first galaxies at the line become low .",
    "as well known , it is more difficult to detect more diffuse sources on the sky with same total luminosity @xcite . in order to examine whether the predicted source can be detected by the jwst , here",
    "we present the typical angular radius of the source at line , in which the number fraction of incoming photons becomes 0.90 , in figure [ fig4 ] for various @xmath20 .",
    "the open circles with the thick solid line and open squares with the thick dashed line represent the typical angular radii of the source observed from the @xmath9- and @xmath8-directions , respectively .",
    "we also present the angular radius corresponding to the physical radius of @xmath102 as the open triangles with the thin dotted line for reference .",
    "numerical results are the open circles , open squares , and open triangles , while the various lines are the linear interpolators of them .",
    "regardless of the observed direction , the typical angular size grows monotonically as @xmath20 decreases ; it ranges from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "the typical angular size of the source increases most rapidly in the case that the source is observed from @xmath8-direction .",
    "according to the results described in the previous section , we discuss the effects of the anisotropic expansion of a halo to the observed line profile and the apparent line luminosity of a redshift 10 galaxy , and then , examine the detectability of the emission by the jwst .      as shown in figure [ fig2 ] and summarized at the 7th column in table [ tab1 ] ,",
    "the mean observed line profile becomes more diffuse in wavelength and the scattered line luminosity becomes dimmer as @xmath20 decreases .",
    "this result implies that , on average , the detectability of the first galaxies by their emissions gets worse as the expansion law of the halos becomes more anisotropic .",
    "moreover , as @xmath20 decreases , the discrepancy between the peak wavelength of the scattered line and the resonant wavelength of in the observer frame becomes more significant .",
    "that is , @xmath70 of the line of the first galaxies does not correspond to @xmath105 .",
    "this discrepancy causes a blunder of the source redshift . in order to estimate the source redshift correctly , other lines of the same source such as h@xmath106 need to be detected",
    "however , once the object with a very broad emission line which is very diffuse on the sky is detected , the effect of scattering in a halo can be easily recognized .",
    "this is because the fwhm of the line is anomalously broad and corresponds to a doppler width at the temperature of @xmath107 ; this is not easily attainable by any other physical processes .",
    "although the features of the emissions from the first galaxies have not been fully understood yet , our results will present useful information because any intrinsic profiles can be concealed by this modified line profile .",
    "turning now to the dependence of detectability of emissions from the first galaxies at redshift 10 on viewing angles , we find the following anisotropic effects of the halos .",
    "first , similar to the mean line , the observed line profile in each viewing angle becomes more diffuse in wavelength as @xmath20 decreases ; this makes the apparent line luminosity less luminous as @xmath20 decreases .",
    "second , however , the dimming and diffusing rates of the line depend on observed direction ; the apparent line luminosity falls most sharply in @xmath8-direction , while it hardly decreases in the @xmath9-direction as @xmath20 decreases .",
    "the differences of the line profile and of the apparent line luminosity among viewing angles are understood by the dependence of the optical depth for photon on propagative direction due to the anisotropic expansion of the halo .",
    "that is , because of the anisotropy in the expansion law of the halo , the optical depth is the largest for photons which propagate into the @xmath8-direction , while it is the smallest for those which travel to the @xmath9-direction .",
    "this means that escaping into @xmath8-direction is the most difficult ; it needs to experience more scattering events and to get larger cumulative wavelength redshift by scattering compared to that into @xmath9-direction .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the direction along the axis of the underlying cdm filament is the most profitable to detect the emission lines of the first galaxies .    in any case , the observed line profiles and the apparent line luminosities of the first galaxies can be quite different from their intrinsic profiles and luminosities .",
    "this modified line profile also needs to be fully understood in order to derive some physical quantities of the first galaxies , e.g. , star formation rates ( sfrs ) and/or the escape fractions of the ionizing photons from their observed line profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flux density represented by equation ( [ eq - flux - density ] ) gives a characteristic value as following : @xmath108 this typical value of @xmath109 , which corresponds to @xmath110 and the ab magnitude of 27.0 mag at @xmath111 , is about one order of magnitude brighter than the limiting @xmath4 flux of jwst for a point source at the north ecliptic pole .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] , our results indicate that emissions from the first galaxies are diffuse on the sky ; their typical angular sizes are a function of @xmath20 and viewing angle , and range from @xmath103 to @xmath112 .    evaluating s / n for the predicted emission with an intrinsic line luminosity of the source of @xmath113 by utilizing the jwst mission simulator ( jms ) , we find that the s / n for the source with @xmath114 is always smaller than 10 over a @xmath115 second exposure .",
    "thus , it might be an observational challenge to detect the emission against the very bright zodiacal light , even though it is at the north ecliptic pole and observed from the direction along the filament axis at the source .",
    "furthermore , in the direction along the filament axis , there are expected to be clusters of galaxies .",
    "the presence of them at the foreground of the first galaxies might make the detection of the emissions more difficult because it is very difficult to discriminate an object with low surface brightness against the one with higher surface brightness at the foreground of it .",
    "however , these clusters of galaxies can boost the detectability of the background emission by gravitational lensing . according to the recent successful observations of the high - redshift laes by gravitational lensing @xcite",
    ", high magnifications ( @xmath116 times ) can be occurred .",
    "this high magnification is occurred only if the background source is in the so - called `` critical regions '' .",
    "location of the region is precisely known for well - understood clusters and depends on a redshift range of the source @xcite . by using the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) lens model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the einstein ring radius of @xmath117 and gaussian profiles as the surface brightness of the source , it is shown that the predicted emission source can be magnified by a factor of @xmath2 . in this case , the resultant s / n reaches @xmath118 over a @xmath119 second exposure .",
    "thus , we conclude that detection of the predicted source at the redshift @xmath120 is feasible over this decade with the jwst .",
    "we insist that the line profiles of the sources at redshift @xmath45 are analogous with those of a source at redshift 10 presented in this paper .",
    "they almost coincide with each other in dimensionless frequency redshift space as shown in figure 6 of kk04 .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate the line luminosities of the source at redshift @xmath45 and the typical angular radius of it at the line , it is sufficient to know the characteristic frequency redshift and the characteristic proper distance at each redshift given in kk04 .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that there is a correlation between the apparent line luminosity of the first galaxies and the underlying cdm structures at the initial contraction stage .",
    "it is also shown that this correlation is further enhanced if the source is observed by using a narrow - band filter targeting to a specific redshift as the recent observations do .",
    "if one of the first galaxies at redshift @xmath3 is detected , this correlation can give us useful information that the underlying cdm filament at the extremely early universe ( cosmological age is younger than @xmath84 gyr ) almost faces us , although degeneracy with the intrinsic line luminosity of the galaxy remains .",
    "possibly , however , sources at @xmath121 are too faint to be detected as single emission sources , but rather the assembly of them can be detected as a diffuse background source at near - infrared wavelength .",
    "this may have already been detected as the cosmic near - infrared background ( cnib ) , reported by independent groups @xcite and can not be explained by normal galaxy populations @xcite .",
    "thus , considered with our results , the cnib may be useful to map the large scale structures at the formation epoch of the galaxies in the early universe .",
    "we investigated a line transfer problem in the anisotropically expanding halos surrounding the first galaxies which are the sources of photons . using the improved numerical code",
    ", we solved the problem with 10 times larger number of test photons than that of kk04 , and examined how much the detectability of the first galaxies at lines depends on viewing angles to them .",
    "we found that the observed profiles and the apparent luminosities of the emission lines , and the typical angular sizes of the first galaxies at line strongly depend on the inclination angle to the axis of the underlying cdm filament .",
    "these physical quantities of the predicted emission lines of the first galaxies are compiled for various @xmath20 .",
    "the direction along the filament axis is found to be more profitable to detect the emission than a direction perpendicular to the axis as the halo is more strongly decelerated against the cosmological hubble expansion . in the perpendicular direction to the axis , because of the very broadened line profiles and the very diffuse surface brightness distributions , there seems to be little hope to detect the emissions from the first galaxies with a typical line luminosity of laes at redshift @xmath122 of @xmath123 . on the other hand , along the filament axis ,",
    "there is expected to be clusters of galaxies as the sources of gravitational lensing .",
    "based on our estimations by using a simple lens model and a simple surface brightness profile for the source , the high magnification with a factor of @xmath124 is expected to the predicted emissions .",
    "we conclude that this high - magnification will allow us to detect the emissions from the first galaxies in this decade with the s / n @xmath2 by jwst . moreover , in order to know their physical quantities like the sfrs and the escape fractions of the ionizing radiation , it is essential to understand the relation between the predicted emission line profile and the ratio of the apparent to the intrinsic line luminosity .",

    "<S> the first galaxies in the universe are built up where cold dark matter ( cdm ) forms large scale filamentary structure . </S>",
    "<S> although the galaxies are expected to emit numerous photons , they are surrounded by plentiful neutral hydrogen with a typical optical depth for of @xmath0 ( halos ) before the era of cosmological reionization . </S>",
    "<S> the halo almost follows the cosmological hubble expansion with some anisotropic corrections around the galaxy because of the gravitational attraction by the underlying cdm filament . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the detectability of the emissions from the first galaxies , examining their dependence on viewing angles . solving the line transfer problem in an anisotropically expanding halo </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the escape probability from the halo is the largest in direction along the filament axis . </S>",
    "<S> if the source is observed with a narrow - band filter , the difference of apparent line luminosities among viewing angles can be a factor of @xmath1 at an extreme case . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we evaluate the predicted physical features of the sources and flux magnification by gravitational lensing effect due to clusters of galaxies along the filament . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , by using the next generation space telescopes like the jwst , the emissions from the first galaxies whose cdm filament axes almost face to us can be detected with the s / n of @xmath2 . </S>"
