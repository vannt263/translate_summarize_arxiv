    "if dark matter particles annihilate and produce gamma rays , as predicted for a popular class of dark matter candidates , we can detect them in _ anisotropy _ in the gamma - ray sky , since the sites of annihilation trace the inhomogeneous matter distribution in the universe  @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray anisotropy has been studied theoretically  @xcite and recently detected with the 22-month data of the fermi large area telescope ( lat )  @xcite .",
    "this signal , however , can be explained entirely by active galaxies called blazars  @xcite .",
    "the current upper bounds on the rate of dark matter annihilation obtained from gamma - ray anisotropy data are still too weak to test the most interesting parameter regions , in which the dark matter mass is on the order of 100  gev and the annihilation cross section is @xmath2  @xmath3  s@xmath4  @xcite as implied from thermal production mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the current bounds are weak because the fermi - lat data at high energies ( @xmath110  gev ) , which are sensitive to dark matter masses of @xmath1100  gev , are still totally photon - noise dominated .",
    "one way to extract signals more efficiently in such a low signal - to - noise regime is to _ cross - correlate _ the noise - dominated data with some signal - dominated data whose signals are spatially well - correlated with those in the noise - dominated data .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the _ existing _ catalog of locations of galaxies in the low - redshift universe ( @xmath0 ) measured by the spectroscopic follow - up observations of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass )  @xcite provides an excellent template , which vastly increases sensitivity to dark matter annihilation in cross correlation with the fermi - lat data .",
    "we find that the expected sensitivity from the five - year fermi data is stringent enough to probe the most interesting parameter regions of the annihilation cross section for large ranges of dark matter masses , although the exact limits are still subject to uncertainties on abundance of dark matter substructures .",
    "we also show that the existing upper limits on the cross correlation of the 21-month fermi data with galaxy catalogs  @xcite already yield much improved limits on the dark matter properties .",
    "cross correlation of the gamma - ray data with gravitational lensing data can also be used to increase sensitivity to dark matter annihilation , as shown by ref .",
    "the mean intensity of the diffuse gamma - ray background due to dark matter annihilation ( the number of photons received per unit area , time , solid angle , and energy range ) is given by @xmath5e , \\chi)\\langle \\delta^2    ( z ) \\rangle , \\label{eq : idm}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the comoving distance out to a given redshift @xmath7 .",

    ", we use the standard value for the cold dark matter particles , @xmath22 .",
    "let us specify some important details of the model . as the rate of annihilation depends on local density squared , the results are sensitive to how clumpy dark matter halos are .",
    "there are two important quantities related to clumpiness .",
    "one is the so - called `` concentration parameter '' of the density profile of halos , and we use the model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath23 and that in ref .",
    ". this model yields results similar to the latest work  @xcite .",
    "we find that the most of the contributions to the anisotropy come from subhalos inside the large - mass halos ( @xmath24 ) at low redshifts ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "the concentration parameters of such large - mass halos have been well characterized .",
    "another important quantity is the boost factor due to subhalos , and we use the model developed by gao et al .  @xcite . their power - law scaling with mass , @xmath25 ,",
    "is recently challenged by snchez - conde and prada  @xcite , who claim to find significantly weaker dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath19 .",
    "this greatly reduces the amplitude of anisotropies as well as the mean intensity . while we continue to adopt the model of ref .",

    "@xcite turns out to be correct .",
    "this is the largest uncertainty in our model , and is common to _ all _ the extragalactic constraints discussed in the literature .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : idm ] , we show @xmath26 from annihilation of 100-gev dark matter purely into @xmath27 with @xmath28 , as well as from two astrophysical sources : blazars and star - forming galaxies . for both populations ,",

    "the upper limit of the integration @xmath42 corresponds to the flux sensitivity of fermi , @xmath43 , integrated above 100  mev , and we adopt @xmath44  @xmath45  s@xmath4 ( @xmath46  @xmath45  s@xmath4 ) for hard ( soft ) sources . for the luminosity function , @xmath47 , for blazars , we adopt the luminosity - dependent density evolution model separately for bl lacs  @xcite and flat - spectrum radio quasars  @xcite , which both roughly behave as a broken power law in luminosity . for the lumonosity function of star - forming galaxies",
    ", we adopt the infrared luminosity function  @xcite , which behaves as a power law with a cutoff luminosity , again separately for spiral and starburst galaxies .",

    "this situation , however , changes completely when we consider the cross correlation of anisotropies .",

    "( [ eq : w_x ] ) ] .",
    "we also replace the power spectrum @xmath69 with @xmath70 , and we approximate it as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the matter power spectrum . for both blazars and star - forming galaxies ,",
    "we assume @xmath73 for their bias parameters .    the angular power spectrum defined by eq .  ( [ eq : angular cross - power ] )",
    "has units of intensity times solid angle , and it is proportional to @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_2mrs ] , we show the predicted @xmath74 with the 2mass redshift survey  @xcite , assuming @xmath75  @xmath3  s@xmath4 in the energy range of 510  gev , for 100-gev dark matter annihilating into @xmath27 .",
    "we also show the predicted cross spectra with the 2mass redshift survey for blazars and star - forming galaxies , respectively . remarkably , we find that the dark matter - galaxy correlation dominates over the other astrophysical contributions .",
    "this is because the low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) 2mass galaxies are less correlated with the astrophysical gamma - ray sources than with dark matter annihilation .",
    "the galactic emission due to cosmic ray interactions is much more concentrated at the halo center than dark matter annihilation ; thus , while the former is easier to be identified with nearby individual sources , the latter yields the larger luminosity density in a local volume .",
    "it is therefore important to use a local galaxy catalog such as 2mass to reduce contamination from blazars and star - forming galaxies .    , between gamma rays from dark matter ( solid ) , blazars ( dashed ) , or star - forming galaxies ( dotted ) , and the 2mass redshift survey galaxies.,width=321 ]    in fig .",

    "another remarkable finding from fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_2mrs ] is that the existing data , i.e. , the five - year data of fermi - lat and the galaxies in the 2mass redshift survey , have sufficient sensitivity to detect gamma rays from dark matter annihilation with the canonical annihilation cross section and @xmath82  gev . to compute the predicted error bars",

    "@xcite and @xmath88  @xmath89  s is the exposure for the five - year fermi - lat operation ( almost independent of energy ) . as for the window function of the fermi - lat angular response , @xmath90 , we use a functional form that approximates the results reported in ref .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the angular power spectrum of the galaxies , @xmath91 , from the redshift distribution of galaxies in the 2mass redshift survey ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , @xmath92 is the shot noise of galaxies given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the number of 2mass galaxies with measured redshifts over @xmath95 of the sky .",
    "a simple error propagation gives the expected uncertainties on theoretical parameters , @xmath96 , given the errors on the power spectrum .",
    "we first compute the fisher matrix @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the amplitudes of the cross spectra for the star - forming galaxies and blazars , respectively , the subscript @xmath101 represents four energy bands ( 12 , 25 , 510 , and 1050  gev ) , and @xmath102 in the denominator is evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : error ] ) at @xmath75  @xmath3  s@xmath4 . , also depends on @xmath103 , the dependence is weak because it is dominated by the photon shot noise .",
    "we thus fix @xmath9 to be the canonical value in @xmath104 when computing the fisher matrix . ]",
    "the covariance between different energy ranges is negligible , as the auto - power spectrum of the gamma - ray data is dominated by shot noise of the photons .",
    "the 95%  cl upper bound on @xmath9 is then obtained with @xmath105 .    .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the bounds from the auto power spectrum of the 22-month of fermi - lat  @xcite , while the dashed lines show the bounds from the cross - power spectra between the 21-month of fermi - lat ( @xmath106 , 3 , and 30  gev from the left to right ) and the 2mass galaxies ( with photometric redshifts ) that we derive using the measurement reported in ref .",
    "the solid curves show the expected bounds from the five - year fermi - lat data cross - correlated with galaxies in the 2mass redshift survey , based on the assumption that all the astrophysical contributions ( lower ) , only blazars ( middle ) , or none of them ( upper ) are understood .",
    "the lower , thick solid curves are derived using the boost factor model of ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the upper , thin solid curves are based on ref .",

    "[ fig : sigmav_limit_2mrs ] shows the most optimistic constraint obtained by assuming that we know the amplitudes of contributions from star - forming galaxies and blazars , i.e. , @xmath107 . the second to the lowest curve shows the realistic bound obtained by varying the amplitudes of contributions from dark matter and star - forming galaxies ( i.e. , the fisher matrix is a @xmath108 matrix for @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) .",
    "finally , the upper thick solid curve shows the conservative bound obtained by varying all @xmath111 s ; i.e. , this bound is obtained by using no prior knowledge on the amplitudes .",
    "this is conservative because we know that the blazar contribution is tightly constrained to be negligible from its luminosity function  @xcite and the angular power spectrum  @xcite , and thus the error associated to this component is much smaller .",
    "the existing bounds on @xmath112 from the auto power spectra of the 22-month fermi - lat  @xcite data are shown in the dot - dashed line .",
    "the five - year cross spectra can improve the constraints by more than one order of magnitude , testing the most interesting parameter space of the dark matter masses and cross sections .",
    "one partial reason for the improvement over the auto - power spectrum is that the analysis of the auto power spectrum is limited to @xmath113 due to potential contamination by the diffuse galactic emission @xcite , whereas we can use the entire multipoles for the cross - power spectrum , as the galactic emission is not correlated with the locations of 2mass galaxies .",
    "this conclusion is subject to the theoretical uncertainty regarding the boost factor , @xmath114 .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite relies on an extrapolation of a power - law relation between the concentration parameter and the halo mass .",
    "reference  @xcite argues that such a power - law extrapolation to very small masses is unphysical , and the relation must necessarily flatten toward lower masses , resulting in substantially fainter subhalos in parent halos with @xmath24 . if we adopt the latter model  @xcite , the amplitude of the cross correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_2mrs ] gets reduced , while there is little change in its shape .",
    "the thin solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmav_limit_2mrs ] shows the expected five - year constraints using the same model . in this case the constraints weaken by an order of magnitude .",
    "this represents the current theoretical uncertainty in the prediction .",
    "what do the current data tell us ?",
    "xia et al .",
    "@xcite have measured the cross - correlation function in configuration space , @xmath115 , from the 21-month fermi - lat data and 770000 2mass galaxies with photometric ( rather than spectroscopic ) redshifts over the angular range of one to ten degrees .",
    "they see no evidence for cross correlation .",
    "thus , we use our model to place upper bounds on @xmath112 from their measurements , by fixing components of the star - forming galaxies and blazars to their baseline models .",
    "we compute the @xmath116 statistics : @xmath117(\\delta c^2)_{ij}^{-1 }    [ c^{\\gamma , { \\rm g}}(\\theta_j )   - c_j],\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the theoretical value of the cross - correlation function corresponding to @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the measured cross correlation in the @xmath101-th angular bin , and @xmath121 is the inverse covariance matrix computed from the jackknife analysis  @xcite . the dashed lines in fig .  [ fig : sigmav_limit_2mrs ] show the 95%  cl upper bounds on @xmath112 from the measurements in @xmath106 , 3 , and 30  gev .",
    "the existing data indeed provide a significant improvement over the auto power spectrum .",
    "this analysis thus provides a proof of concept .",
    "_ other possible astrophysical sources._there are other astrophysical source classes that trace dark matter and contribute to the gamma - ray background .",
    "misaligned active galaxies are one such example , and it has been shown that they could give larger contribution to the mean intensity than blazars although with much larger uncertainties ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "our fisher - matrix approach adopted in sec .",
    "[ sec : cross correlation ] , however , relies on no prior information on the amplitudes of the cross - power spectrum for both the blazars and star - forming galaxies , with which we still obtain quite stringent upper limits on dark matter annihilation cross section .",
    "this is because the energy dependence on the cross - power spectrum is properly taken into account , where a characteristic spectrum of dark matter component ( fig .",
    "[ fig : idm ] ) plays an essential role . therefore , unless they feature an energy spectrum very different from a power law , contributions from any other astrophysical sources will be degenerate with either blazars or star - forming galaxies , and our conclusions will be unchanged .",
    "_ uncertainty on galaxy bias._the bias parameter of the galaxy distribution is well constrained in the linear regime , but to a less extent in the nonlinear regime . to this end , the approximation we adopted , @xmath122 with a constant linear bias @xmath60 , is appropriate for the two - halo term , which dominates up to @xmath123 .",
    "the one - halo term dominates at higher multipoles , where the galaxy bias is likely nonlinear .",
    "the nonlinear bias tends to increase the small - scale power spectrum , which is currently difficult to predict due to uncertainties in the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "we thus assume the linear bias on small scales , but our prediction for the small - scale power may be an underestimate by a few tens of percent .",
    "however , this uncertainty on the bias for 2mass galaxies unlikely affects the conclusions , because it is common for all the gamma - ray sources and we obtain significant statistics already from the linear regime alone .",
    "_ correlation with gravitational lensing._instead of using galaxy positions , the cross - correlation analysis can be performed with a map of projected mass - density fields constructed from measurements of the gravitational lensing effect toward many background galaxies  @xcite .",
    "such an analysis should also be pursued in order to further increase sensitivity as well as to improve robustness of the results against systematic errors .    _",
    "summary._we showed that taking cross correlations between the gamma - ray background and the 2mass galaxy catalog provides very strong probe of dark matter annihilation .",
    "if the mass of the dark matter particles is on the order of 100 gev , an upper limit on the annihilation cross section one can obtain by using five - year fermi data will exclude its canonical value inferred from the thermal freeze - out scenario even after taking uncertainties on astrophysical sources into account .",
    "we note , however , that this depends on the amount of substructures present in host dark matter halos .",
    "we acknowledge the grappa workshop on `` anisotropic universe '' for providing the opportunity to initiate this study .",
