    "( this procedure has proved convenient for the analysis of neutrino data , which all fall into this timeframe . )    the possibility that the solar core may rotate more slowly than the radiative zone ( that has a sidereal rotation rate of about 13.5 year@xmath1 ) has led us to conjecture that there may be an `` inner tachocline , '' separating the core from the radiative zone @xcite . by analogy with the `` outer tachocline '' that separates the radiative zone from the convection zone",
    ", this would be a localized region where there is a sharp radial gradient in the rotation rate .",
    "the well known rieger oscillation @xcite may be interpreted as an r - mode oscillation @xcite in the outer tachocline @xcite .",

    "the frequencies relevant to processes within the sun are given by    @xmath6    the rieger oscillation , with frequency 2.37 year@xmath1 corresponding to a period of 154 days , may be interpreted as an r - mode oscillation with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where the sidereal rotation frequency is 14.2 year@xmath1 .",
    "this rotation frequency identifies the source of these oscillations as the outer tachocline @xcite .",
    "we have recently carried out a power - spectrum analysis of a sequence of 39,024 measurements of the solar diameter made at the mount wilson solar observatory @xcite .",
    "this analysis yields strong evidence for an array of oscillations that may be attributed to a set of r - mode frequencies ( for @xmath9 ) originating in an internal location where the sidereal rotation frequency is 12.08 year@xmath1 .",
    "this estimate also is suggestive of a source in the inner tachocline .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the rieger and related oscillations may be attributed to r - mode oscillations that develop in a region where the sidereal rotation rate is near 13.7 year@xmath1 , placing it in the familiar tachocline @xcite .",
    "this suggests that r - mode oscillations are unstable and can grow to large amplitudes in regions where there is a radial gradient in angular velocity .",
    "( in this connection , it is interesting to note that zaqarashvili et al . have shown theoretically that a _",
    "latitudinal _ gradient in angular velocity can lead to instability @xcite . )",
    "since the r - mode oscillations manifested in the lmsu and mt wilson data seem to occur where the sidereal rotation rate is close to 12 year@xmath1 ( much less than the rotation rate of the radiative zone ) , these results are compatible with the proposal that these oscillations develop in an _ inner tachocline _ that separates the core from the radiative zone .",
    "we have recently presented the results of power - spectrum analyses of nuclear decay data acquired at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite and at the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt laboratory ( ptb ) @xcite .",
    "analysis of bnl data yields evidence of periodicities at or near 11.2 year@xmath1 and 11.9 year@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "when the bnl analysis is combined with an analysis of ptb data , we find the dominant oscillation to be at about 11.2 year@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if this is interpreted as a rotational modulation , we see that these oscillations originate in a region with a sidereal rotation rate of about 12.2 year@xmath1 , not far from the estimates of rotation rates inferred from our analysis of r - mode oscillations",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] shows the power spectrum formed from lmsu data for the frequency range 10 - 15 year@xmath1 we see that the biggest peak in this range is one at 10.92 year@xmath1 with power @xmath24 .",
    "if interpreted as a rotational modulation , it corresponds to a sidereal rotation frequency of 11.92 year@xmath1 , not far from the value ( 12 year@xmath1 ) inferred from our r - mode analysis .    .",
    "the biggest peak is found at 10.92 year@xmath1 , with power @xmath25=4.93 . ]    concerning internal rotation rates , it is interesting to review the results of power spectrum analyses of the super - kamiokande solar neutrino data @xcite .",
    "the most prominent peak in a power spectrum analysis of super - kamiokande data ( in 5-day bins ) is found at 9.43 year@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if this peak is attributed to rotational modulation , it indicates that the sun contains a region with a sidereal rotation rate of 10.43 year@xmath1 , which is suggestive of a slowly rotating core .    in discussing the power spectrum of super - kamiokande data",
    ", it is important to note that if these data are analyzed by the lomb - scargle procedure ( as in the analysis carried out by the super - kamiokande consortium @xcite ) , this peak does not appear to be statistically significant .",
    "however , if the data are analyzed by a likelihood procedure that takes account of the error estimates and of the specific durations of the time - bins ( which the lomb - scargle procedure does not ) , the peak is found to be quite significant @xcite .",
    "if the inner tachocline extends from the core , with a rotation rate of about 10.4 year@xmath1 , to the radiative zone , with a rotation rate of about 13.7 year@xmath1 , we see that the rotation rate has the value 12 year@xmath1 in the center of the tachocline .",
