    "in the quest for solving the schrdinger equation for both bound and continuum states , square - integrable bases have been repeatedly used . for bound states",
    "this turns out to be a traditional way to obtain the spectral properties of quantum systems .",
    "it has been shown however that a single representation of the schrdinger equation in terms of an @xmath0 basis can be formulated that allows for a description of both bound and continuum states @xcite .",
    "a version of such a formulation is called the algebraic model of the resonating group method ( hereafter referred to as the algebraic model or am ) .",
    "it was originally tailored to treat clusterized problems , but can be used for all kinds of quantum mechanical many - particle configurations without major modifications .",
    "the am has been formulated in terms of different types of bases , depending on the more specific features of the quantum system considered .",
    "one very important feature of the am is the fact that the boundary conditions of the system are translated from a coordinate space context to the context of expansion coefficients , and are explicitly incorporated in the dynamical equations @xcite .    we will consider a specific am formulation ( i.e.  a specific @xmath0 basis ) to elucidate the analysis of the method . the methodology used for this analysis",
    "is of a general nature however , and can be repeated for other bases .",
    "the specific am version chosen in this paper features an oscillator basis , and is in particular very suitable for obtaining both the bound and continuum spectra of nuclear systems with very different configurational properties ; where appropriate , nuclear spectroscopic units will therefore be used .",
    "the choice of this am version is mainly due to the background of the authors .",
    "results of the am approach considered here have already been reported on @xcite , and show in particular how the coupling of cluster and collective configurations can be treated seamlessly in such a description .    where necessary , a specific form for the potential operator will be used .",
    "we will consider a gaussian form in this work .",
    "although this again is a popular potential form in nuclear spectroscopic calculations , it is also an interesting functional form to approximate a large variety of potentials by discrete and continuous superpositions .",
    "we will concentrate our attention to the solutions of the dynamical equations for scattering situations only , as these are much more involved than the bound state problems .",
    "indeed , the latter can be well approximated by a simple diagonalization of the energy matrix , as is well known .",
    "we will specifically discuss how strongly the convergence of the solutions of an am system depend on the parameters of the problem .",
    "in particular the dependence on the precision and the convergence properties of the solutions of both the oscillator radius of the basis ( the parameter unambiguously fixing the square - integrable basis ) and the form of the potential energy contribution , will be treated in detail .",
    "the convergence is crucial for obtaining stable approximations to the solutions of problems expressed in terms of an ( infinite ) set of basis functions , in our case an @xmath0 basis .",
    "this problem was repeatedly investigated , mainly for bound - state solutions . as applications to scattering problems , expressed in an @xmath0 basis , appeared ,",
    "several algorithms were suggested to accelerate the convergence of the results within a restricted subset of the basis .",
    "for instance , heller and yamani @xcite used `` kato correction '' , and revai et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the `` lanczos factor '' .",
    "a more intuitive approximation was proposed by fillipov et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the am equations presented in this work will be shown to lead to ( 1 ) an optimal choice for the basis , given the potential , yielding well - converging and stable solutions of the am system , or , if the optimal basis can not be used , to ( 2 ) algorithmic procedures for solving the am system in an acceptable and controlled approximation .",
    "these algorithmic procedures will depend on the specific choice made for the basis ( i.e.  the oscillator radius chosen ) , but also on information on the asymptotic behaviour of the expansion coefficients , as well as on the dynamical equations themselves . in this way the algorithm used",
    "will depend on the physical properties of the system considered .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "the different strategies for solving am equations will be applied explicitly to a number of problems from nuclear , atomic and molecular physics .",
    "choosing an oscillator basis to describe some specific hilbert subspace in which to solve the schrdinger equation leads to the following form of the latter in terms of a system of linear equations : @xmath1 where the coefficients @xmath2 are the expansion coefficients in the oscillator basis of the wave function corresponding to the energy e @xmath3 and subject to a typical boundary condition .",
    "for simplicity we have omitted the angular momentum quantum number as well as the energy dependence of the coefficients @xmath4 .",
    "the boundary conditions of quantum systems are traditionally expressed in coordinate space , but can also be formulated in terms of the expansion coefficients @xmath4 . indeed , for very large @xmath5 , the dynamical equations are reduced to a simple ( in an oscillator basis a three - term recurrence ) form containing the kinetic energy operator solely .",
    "the equations can therefore be solved analytically for very large @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned reduction of the equations only involves the supposition that the potential energy matrix elements vanish for very large @xmath5 , which has been shown to be an acceptable approximation for relatively short - range interactions .",
    "one obtains the following asymptotic behaviour for bound states : @xmath6 and for continuum states : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the traditional bessel and neumann special functions .",
    "a striking resemblance with the asymptotic forms of a wave function in coordinate representation is observed , by replacing the radial coordinate in the latter by the discrete value @xmath10 .",
    "a heuristic argument for this observation is that @xmath11 corresponds to the turning point of the oscillator in state @xmath12 with angular momentum @xmath13 .",
    "in the previous section we introduced the infinite dimensional system of linear equations obtained from the am formulation , to be solved subject to a proper boundary condition . as indicated earlier we will concentrate on the scattering situation , and therefore only consider the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath4 corresponding to the continuum boundary condition .    a scheme for solving the linear system of equations",
    "quite naturally presents itself . under the assumption that the matrix elements potential",
    "energy vanish for sufficiently large values of one of the basis state indices @xmath14 or @xmath15 , one chooses a limiting value @xmath16 to set this vanishing point in terms of the basis states . in the region where the potential matrix elements are neglected ,",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath4 are then given by ( [ eq : algcoefascont ] ) , and can be written as @xmath17 assuming @xmath16 to be sufficiently large , with @xmath18    the choice for @xmath16 divides the linear system in three different regions :    * a finite number of n equations with @xmath19 , in which the potential energy matrix elements are fully taken into account .",
    "these equations correspond to the `` internal region '' in terms of the basis states * an infinite number of equations corresponding to @xmath20 , in which the potential energy matrix elements are neglected .",
    "these equations correspond to the `` asymptotic region '' , and are trivially fulfilled due to the boundary condition * the equation with @xmath21 , in which the potential matrix elements are neglected .",
    "this equation corresponds to the `` matching condition '' , as it couples the internal region through coefficient @xmath22 with the asymptotic region through the phase - shift @xmath23    this scheme amounts to solving the following @xmath24 dimensional system of linear equations for the @xmath16 coefficients @xmath4 with @xmath25 , and the phase - shift @xmath23 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 stands for the kinetic energy operator .    as the potential matrix elements do not actually drop to zero exactly for @xmath29",
    ", one should vary the value of @xmath16 to test the stability of the solution .",
    "it turns out that this stability strongly depends on the specific problem considered . as an example",
    ", the solution of the linear system of equations for a nuclear two - cluster problem , in which the distance of the clusters is considered as the degree of freedom , shows a rapid convergence in terms of @xmath16 .",
    "a solution for a monopole description of the nucleus , in which the radius of the nucleus is considered to be the prominent degree of freedom , shows a very slow convergence in terms of @xmath16 .",
    "these results indicate that one should be very careful when omitting potential energy matrix elements , and that a proper study of the form of the equations is necessary .",
    "to study the properties of the ( in principle infinite dimensional ) linear system ( [ eq : algeqgen ] ) to be solved , we will rewrite this set of equations using the following substitution for the expansion coefficients @xmath4 : @xmath30 by this substitution , the coefficients @xmath4 are considered to represent a deviation from the asymptotic behaviour , i.e.  the coefficients @xmath31 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath32 then quantifies this deviation , which in particular will be zero in the true asymptotic region ( i.e.  for very large @xmath5 ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : cndevas ] ) is responsible for the long - range behaviour of the system .",
    "the second term corresponds to the short - range correction caused by the potential ; in other words , in coordinate representation the coefficients @xmath33 would represent that part of the wave - function that is dominated by , and within the range of , the potential .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath32 as a function of @xmath5 thus provides a key element for determining a proper index @xmath16 distinguishing the internal from the asymptotic region in terms of the basis functions .    rewriting the original",
    "am linear system of equations ( [ eq : algeqgen ] ) in the unknowns @xmath34 , yields an equivalent linear system in the unknowns @xmath35 , where @xmath23 is defined by the following form of the asymptotic expansion coefficients @xmath36 : @xmath37    because the asymptotic coefficients now appear for all @xmath5 in this representation , they should be properly defined . in order to do so",
    ", we consider the coordinate representation of the outgoing asymptotic wave - functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which are originally defined as the two linearly independent solutions of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the kinetic energy operator .",
    "@xmath38 is commonly called the `` regular '' solution , and behaves properly for all @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath39 is the `` irregular '' solution , and has an irregular ( infinite ) behaviour near the origin @xmath43 . to provide a regular character at the origin for both @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we redefine their equations in the following way , as was suggested earlier by heller and yamani @xcite : @xmath44 the non - zero right - hand side in ( [ eq : psipluspsiminus ] ) , in which @xmath45 represents the zero - quanta oscillator state , and where @xmath46 equals @xmath47 accounts for a regular behaviour near the origin for the modified @xmath48 : @xmath49 in terms of a fourier representation , using oscillator states as a basis ,",
    "one then has the following well - defined expansion : @xmath50 this provides a proper definition for the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 in ( [ eq : ascoef ] ) , the `` regular '' , resp .",
    "`` irregular '' asymptotic coefficients , the explicit form of which can be found in @xcite .",
    "the equations for the asymptotic coefficients in fourier space are then : @xmath53 one notices an identical form for all equations , except for the single one with @xmath54 .",
    "substituting the solutions of ( [ eq : ascoefdef ] ) for the asymptotic coefficients in the set of equations ( [ eq : algeqgen ] ) , taking into account the substitutions ( [ eq : cndevas ] ) and ( [ eq : ascoef ] ) , then leads to the following linear system : @xmath55 =   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty < n \\mid",

    "let us introduce the `` dynamical regular and irregular coefficients '' @xmath56 and @xmath57 as follows : @xmath58 or , in an alternative integral representation in three - dimensional coordinate space : @xmath59 where we use the coordinate representation of @xmath60 , the n - quanta oscillator function @xmath61 : @xmath62 substitution of the dynamical coefficients ( [ eq : splussminus ] ) in ( [ eq : algeqnew ] ) leads to @xmath63 = -v_{n}^{(+ ) } \\label{eq : algeqwiths}\\ ] ]    no approximations have been made so far to obtain this representation of the am dynamical equations .",
    "we have taken into account the main ( asymptotic ) behaviour of the solutions in the equations , and used a regularization scheme to achieve this in a well - defined way .    to reveal how the am linear system can be solved in a numerically optimal , or at least acceptable , way , an analysis of the dynamical coeeficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 seems imperative .",
    "it is indeed clear that , if e.g.  @xmath56 and @xmath57 , from a given index @xmath5 on , are sufficiently zero when compared to the other terms in ( [ eq : algeqwiths ] ) , the equations are reduced in a controlled and secure way .",
    "there is another important reason to investigate the behaviour of @xmath64 .",
    "it is indeed well - known from the integral equation formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite that : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the exact solution of the schrdinger equation obtained with potential @xmath67 . in an oscillator representation , ( [ eq : newton ] )",
    "reads as : @xmath68 from which we immediately recognize the importance of @xmath56 in the convergence of the solutions of the continuous spectrum .",
    "the analysis of @xmath64 , @xmath69 must be done in terms of the basis index @xmath5 , of the oscillator parameter @xmath70 fixing the basis , and of the potential energy parameters .",
    "results emerging from such an analysis can then be checked by studying the solutions @xmath32 and @xmath71 as a function of the same parameters .      to analyze the behaviour of",
    "the am set of linear equations and its defining quantities in a more or less general way , we consider a simple gaussian potential of the form @xmath72 there are a number of reasons to justify such a choice : ( 1 ) an operator with gaussian functional form is easily handled in a harmonic oscillator basis , as matrix elements can be calculated using closed expressions , or simple recurrence formulae ; ( 2 ) ( semi- ) realistic potentials are often expressed explicitly as a finite sum of gaussians , each with specific amplitude and width parameters , and are of common use e.g.  in nuclear physics calculations ; ( 3 ) a very large class of potentials can be expressed in terms of a gaussian transform , such as e.g.  a yukawa or a coulomb potential .",
    "in general the matrix elements of the potential energy operator , due to the @xmath73 dependence of the latter , will depend on the ratio @xmath74 . in the specific case of a gaussian potential one",
    "has an explicit dependence on @xmath75 this means that matrix elements of the gaussian potential energy operator in an oscillator basis are invariant under all scale transformations of @xmath76 and @xmath70 which preserve @xmath77 , and different physical situations will lead to the same matrix @xmath78",
    ". in particular , small values of @xmath77 are realised by small values of @xmath70 relative to @xmath76 , or large values of @xmath76 relative to @xmath70 ; this situation corresponds to a `` long range '' potential .",
    "large values of @xmath77 correspond likewise to a `` short range '' potential .",
    "the potential is certainly not the only parametrized quantity characterizing the set of am equations .",
    "the oscillator radius of the oscillator basis is another and equally important parameter , because of the repercussion on the values of both the kinetic and potential matrix elements appearing in the equations . in this section",
    "we will therefore study the behaviour of the am equations as a function of both the oscillator radius of the basis , and the width of the gaussian potential . actually ,",
    "as indicated by ( [ eq : defgamma ] ) only the ratio of these quantities is required , without any loss of generality for the current analysis .",
    "we therefore make a specific choice of potential parameters , namely @xmath79 and @xmath80 , so that the potential has both a discrete and continuous spectrum .",
    "the @xmath77 ratio will then be varied by adapting the oscillator radius @xmath70 .",
    "a central theme in the analysis is the characterization for a rapidly converging , and stabilized , solution of the am equations .",
    "this is most naturally done by searching for a maximal , limiting , value for the number of basis states involved in a specific solution , depending on the problem parameters used . as the asymptotic behaviour of the solution",
    "is governed essentially by the kinetic energy term , one should therefore take into account how both potential and kinetic matrix elements behave with respect to one another .",
    "in other words , it is not sufficient to know about the insignificance of potential matrix elements in absolute terms to decide whether one has reached the asymptotic region , but rather consider some relative insignificance with respect to the value of the kinetic matrix elements .",
    "when working in a coordinate representation , one can obtain a lot of information concerning the wave - function by analyzing the hamiltonian only , and this both in terms of coordinate and energy ranges .",
    "the main reason for this is that the hamiltonian is globally defined in the whole coordinate space . in a @xmath0 representation , in our case using an oscillator basis , this is not such a straightforward matter .",
    "the main parameters determining the rate of convergence , as well as the behaviour of the solution ( the wave - function in an oscillator representation ) , are of a `` global '' nature , such as , and so on .",
    "the matrix elements of the kinetic , respectively potential energy operators are `` local '' quantities ( cfr . the value of these operators in a single point in coordinate space ) .",
    "the study of these elements however reveals the peculiarities of the `` global '' quantities , and will help to understand their behaviour .",
    "concerning the kinetic energy term , two remarks are very important in the context of an oscillator basis .",
    "the kinetic energy contribution has a very simple representation in terms of the oscillator basis : ( 1 ) it is proportional to the inverse square of the oscillator radius @xmath70 , and ( 2 ) the kinetic energy matrix has a tri - diagonal form , i.e.  has non - zero matrix elements only along the major diagonal and the first subdiagonals .",
    "[ fig : pot_3d ] displays the overall ( qualitative ) behaviour of a typical gaussian potential matrix in some specific oscillator basis .",
    "the main properties to be noted are the comportment of ( 1 ) the main diagonal which falls off monotonically for large @xmath5 , and of ( 2 ) the non - diagonal matrix elements with non - zero values concentrated symmetrically around the main diagonal .",
    "this structure of the potential contribution is certainly of a promising nature , regarding the earlier remarks concerning the kinetic energy contribution .    a more quantitative view of the diagonal behaviour of the potential matrix is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot_diag ] , and this for a number of choices of oscillator bases .",
    "three different views are presented in this figure : ( a ) the pure diagonal matrix elements ; ( b ) the diagonal matrix elements multiplied by the square of the oscillator radius ( eliminating the kinetic energy dependence on the choice of basis ) , and ( c ) the diagonal matrix elements normalized with respect to the first one ; both figures [ fig : pot_diag ] ( a ) and [ fig : pot_diag ] ( b ) lead to fig . [ fig : pot_diag ] ( c ) through this normalization . from these figures",
    "it should be clear that one has to be careful when drawing conclusions for a proper choice of basis .",
    "[ fig : pot_diag ] ( a ) might suggest that very large values of the oscillator radius @xmath70 are optimal .",
    "[ fig : pot_diag ] ( b ) on the contrary might suggest that very small values of @xmath70 are optimal . the normalized fig . [",
    "fig : pot_diag ] ( c ) finally suggests that , for the current potential parameters , the interval for @xmath70 between @xmath81 and @xmath82 would be optimal . fig .",
    "[ fig : pot_diag ] at least reveals that there are important differences in behaviour of the potential energy contribution for different choices of the oscillator radius .",
    "later on it will be shown in a more quantitative way that the qualitative conclusion for an optimal @xmath70 interval as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig : pot_diag ] ( c ) is correct .",
    "an interesting conclusion that is apparent from the figure is that a ( coordinate space defined ) short - range potential turns out to have a long - range character in an oscillator representation .",
    "as the oscillator basis is used as a fourier basis to portray the solution , this is a well - known effect in terms of fourier representation theory .    a quantitative view of the non - diagonal behaviour of the potential matrix for the same bases displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot_diag ] can be found in fig . [",
    "fig : pot_mid ] , and this by showing a typical row for a fixed column index ( @xmath83 in this case ) .",
    "the same 3 views ( pure , multiplied by @xmath84 , and normalized with respect to the diagonal matrix element with @xmath83 ) are shown respectively in figures [ fig : pot_mid ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) . again a strong dependence on the choice of the oscillator radius is remarked , but it is much more difficult to draw conclusions for an optimally converging basis from these figures . as this figure indicates that the potential energy contribution is concentrated around the main diagonal of the matrix , but with a relatively important distribution , it should already warn against carelessly applying the simple but straightforward solution scheme presented in section 2 of this paper !",
    "the previous figures thus only allow us to initiate some general discussion , but not to draw final and well - formed conclusions on the convergence problem , let alone on the determination of an optimal basis and the number of states involved in a stable solution .",
    "up to now only local views of the potential contribution , i.e.  matrix elements and their behaviour , have been considered to provide possible hints for a properly converging solution .",
    "the new representation of the am equations presented earlier in this section introduced some new , global quantities which might be of interest in the convergence analysis .",
    "these are the dynamical coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and they combine all matrix elements of row @xmath5 as indicated above . if , and when , these quantities would be ( sufficiently ) zero from a given value @xmath16 on , this would certainly determine the maximal number of oscillator states to be considered for a converging solution . as @xmath56 and @xmath57 depend on both the potential and the basis parameters ,",
    "they will be analyzed as a function of the ratio of potential width to oscillator radius .",
    "as @xmath56 and @xmath57 also depend explicitly on energy , this will be an additional parameter to consider .    a qualitative view of @xmath56 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_3d ] ( a ) as a function of both the index @xmath5 and the ratio @xmath74 ; the quantity was normalized with respect to @xmath85 , and the scale is a logarithmic one . from this figure one immediately notices that a well - defined value of the ratio of the potential to oscillator radius zeroes the quantities for already very small values of @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig : s_3d ] ( b ) depicts the same view for @xmath57 , carrying an analogous conclusion .",
    "although both optimal values do not coincide completely , they are sufficiently close to define a narrow interval of optimal values for a swiftly converging solution . indeed",

    "the value @xmath16 then determines the number of basis functions needed to obtain a well - converged solution .",
    "indeed , the solutions of ( [ eq : algeqnew ] ) are deviations with respect to the ( known ) asymptotic solutions , and become zero when both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are ( sufficiently ) zero .",
    "in other words , the value @xmath16 from which on @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and thus the solutions @xmath89 , are zero determines what would be called in rgm terminology the matching point between the internal and the asymptotic region .",
    "it is important to remark that @xmath16 is determined prior to solving the am equations , and is obtained from the simple knowledge of the potential energy matrix elements .    to corroborate",
    "the fact for an optimal choice of basis for a given gaussian potential , a quantitative view of @xmath56 and @xmath57 as a function of the radius parameter @xmath70 is shown in figures [ fig : s_2d ] ( a ) and ( b ) for a selected number of @xmath5 values . from this figure",
    "one can determine for which values of the radius parameter one obtains a properly converged solution , by considering the intersection of both optimal intervals for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "one notices that for a potential consisting of a single gaussian term , a very limited number of basis states is necessary for a proper convergence . for more intricate potential forms",
    "this will not necessarily be the case , although an optimal value for the radius parameter , be it associated with a relatively larger value of @xmath16 , will still be available .    to check the dependence of the so - called `` optimal '' @xmath70 values ( or regions ) as a function of energy , fig .",
