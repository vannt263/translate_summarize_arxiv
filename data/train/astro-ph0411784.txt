    "several numerical investigations have recently been carried out to study the properties of acoustic modes of magnetized stars ( e.g. , dziembowski & goode 1996 , bigot et al 2000 , cunha & gough 2000 , saio & gautschy 2004 ) , particularly for roap stars ( kurtz 1990 ) .",
    "these authors solved the problem of the oscillations of a magnetized star by applying a singular perturbation theory to the stellar oscillation . in their treatment , the stellar interior was divided into the thin surface magnetic layer where the magnetic pressure @xmath6 is comparable to or greater than the gas pressure @xmath7 and the non - magnetic core where the gas pressure is dominant over the magnetic pressure ( biront et al 1982 , roberts & soward 1983 , cambell & papaloizou 1986 ) .",
    "linearized ideal mhd equations were integrated in the thin surface magnetic layer , and non - magnetic oscillation equations were integrated in the core , and then the two integrations were matched at the interface between the magnetic and non - magnetic regions to make a complete solution .",
    "this treatment is based on the following properties of magnetic perturbations in the interior of stars .",
    "if we assume that the gass pressure dominates the magnetic pressure , or equivalently that the alfvn wave velocity @xmath8 is much slower than the sound velocity @xmath9 in the deep interior , it is reasonable to consider that the magnetic perturbations are largely determined by the induction equation .",
    "but , there also exists a component of magnetic perturbations that originates from the lorentz force term @xmath10 in the equation of motion . for a typical oscillation frequency of acoustic modes",
    ", this component appears as very short magnetic perturbations , the wavelengths of which are much shorter than those of the acoustic modes . in the limit of @xmath11 in the deep interior",
    ", we can expect the short wave component of the magnetic perturbations may be lost from the wave system suffering strong dissipation , which makes it legitimate to divide the stellar interior into a magnetic surface layer and a non - magnetic core and to disregard the short wave component in the core ( e.g. , biront et al 1982 , roberts & soward 1983 ) . if we assume that the oscillation energy imparted by the short magnetic perturbations is lost from the wave system ( biront et al 1982 , roberts & soward 1983 ) , this @xmath12 of the magnetic perturbation energies works as a damping mechanism for the acoustic modes .",
    "this damping mechanism was implemented in global acoustic mode calculations , for example , by bigot et al ( 2000 ) , cunha & gough ( 2000 ) , saio & gautschy ( 2004 ) .",
    "although the studies mentioned above were all for non - rotating stars , shibahashi & takata ( 1993 ) and takata & shibahashi ( 1995 ) have developed a theory of the oscillations of rotating magnetized stars , treating both rotation and the magnetic field as small perturbations to the oscillations of non - rotating and non - magnetic stars .",
    "they recognized , however , that the perturbational treatment of the magnetic field in the surface layer might not be justified .",
    "bigot & dziembowski ( 2002 ) have also considered the effects of a magnetic field and rotation on acoustic oscillations . although they assumed a slow rotation to treat high radial order @xmath7-modes , they employed a non - perturbative approach for the magnetic field , to improve the analyses by shibahashi & takata ( 1993 ) and dziembowski & goode ( 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath13-modes of neutron stars have attracted good attention recently because of the recognition that the @xmath0-modes are driven unstable by the emission of gravitational radiation ( andersson 1998 , friedman & morsink 1998 ) due to chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz instability mechanism ( chandrasekhar 1970 , friedman & schutz 1978 a , b ) .",
    "the @xmath0-modes of rotating neutron stars are expected to be a good candidate for a gravitational wave source ( e.g. , andersson & kokkotas 2004 ) .",
    "they are also regarded as a mechanism that decelerates the spin of young neutron stars , since the gravitational radiation carries away angular momentum of the star ( e.g. , owen et al 1998 ) .",
    "however , before we draw a decisive conclusion concerning the role played by the @xmath0-modes in neutron star physics , we need to examine how strongly the modal properties are affected by various physical factors such as viscosity , solid crust , superfluidity , general relativity , nonlinear amplitude saturation , and so on .",
    "a magnetic field of the star is one of such influential factors .",
    "@xmath13-mode oscillations of rotating magnetized neutron stars have been discussed by rezzolla , lamb , & shapiro ( 2000 ) , ho & lai ( 2000 ) , and morsink & rezania ( 2002 ) .",
    "for example , ho & lai ( 2000 ) estimated the shifts of the @xmath0-mode frequency caused by the strong magnetic field using a local linear analysis , suggesting that the oscillation manifests itself as rossby waves in the bulk interior , but assumes the alfvn wave character near the stellar surface .",
    "morsink & rezania ( 2002 ) developed , based on the formalism introduced by schenk et al ( 2002 ) , a formalism to compute the magnetically modified global @xmath0-modes , without assuming a weak magnetic field of the star . in this paper , we approach the problem of the oscillations of a rotating magnetized star by applying a singular perturbation theory to the oscillations of a rotating non - magnetic star ( e.g. , lee & saio 1986 ) . in  2 , we derive the oscillation equations of a rotating magnetized star , assuming the axis of the dipole field is aligned with the axis of rotation .",
    " 3 is for numerical results , and  4 is for discussions and conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we assume adiabatic oscillations of a uniformly rotating star and employ the cowling approximation , neglecting the euler perturbation of the gravitational potential .",
    "we also assume that the axis of the magnetic dipole field is aligned with that of rotation .",
    "if we employ spherical polar coordinates @xmath14 whose origin is at the center of the star , a magnetic dipole field may be given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the magnetic dipole moment , and we have assumed that the axis of the field corresponds to the coordinate axis defined by @xmath17 .",
    "when the axes of rotation and the magnetic field are aligned , it is possible to assume that the equilibrium state is axisymmetric with respect to the axe @xmath17 , and that the time and azimuthal angular dependence of the perturbations is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the oscillation frequency in an inertial frame and @xmath20 is an integer representing the azimuthal wave number .",
    "note that the magnetic dipole field is a force free field ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) and does not affect the equilibrium structure of the star . since we are interested in low frequency oscillations in this paper , we neglect the effects of rotational deformation .",
    "linearized ideal mhd equations with infinite conductivity may be given by ( e.g. , unno et al 1989 ) @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 and for adiabatic pulsations @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass density , @xmath7 is the pressure , @xmath27 is the angular velocity of rotation , @xmath28 is the magnetic field , and the physical quantities with a prime @xmath29 denote their euler perturbations , @xmath30 is the displacement vector , and @xmath31 denotes the oscillation frequency observed in the corotating frame of the star . here , @xmath32 is the schwartzshild discriminant defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34    to represent the angular dependence of the perturbations of a rotating magnetized star , we expand the perturbed quantities in terms of spherical harmonic functions with different degrees @xmath35 for a given @xmath20 .",
    "the displacement vector @xmath30 is then given by @xmath36 @xmath37 e^{i\\sigma t},\\ ] ] @xmath38 e^{i\\sigma t},\\ ] ] and the perturbed magnetic field @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 @xmath41 e^{i\\sigma t},\\ ] ] @xmath42 e^{i\\sigma t},\\ ] ] and a perturbed scalar quantity such as @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 for even modes , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 for odd modes , respectively , and @xmath50 .",
    "substituting the expansions into the linearized basic equations ( 2 ) to ( 5 ) , we obtain a set of coupled ordinary linear differential equations of infinite dimension for the expansion coefficients .",
    "if we use for the expansion coefficients vector notation given by @xmath51 the oscillation equations of a rotating star with an aligned magnetic dipole field are given in the cowling approximation as @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath13 being the mass and",
    "the radius of the star , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 here , equation ( 16 ) comes from the continuity equation ( 3 ) , equations ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) from the radial and the horizontal components of the equation of motion ( 2 ) , and equations ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) from the induction equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 are defined as @xmath65 and the non - zero elements of the matrices @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are given by @xmath70 @xmath71 for even modes , and @xmath72 @xmath73 for odd modes , and @xmath74 denotes the unit matrix .",
    "the definition of the matrices @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the same as that given in lee & saio ( 1990 ) .",
    "the oscillation equations derived above are integrated in the thin surface magnetic layer , and non - magnetic oscillation equations ( e.g. , lee & saio 1986 ) are integrated in the non - magnetic core .",
    "the two integrations are matched at the interface between the magnetic and non - magnetic regions to obtain a complete solution .    for numerical computation , we solve a finite set of the linear ordinary differential equations , which is derived by truncating the infinite expansions of perturbed quantities so that the first @xmath80 expansion coefficients with @xmath81 and @xmath82 from @xmath83 to @xmath84 are retained for each quantity . in most cases ,",
    "we employ @xmath85 in this paper . using a relaxation method ( e.g. , unno et al 1989 ) , we solve as an eigenvalue problem for @xmath86 the finite set of linear differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions at the center and the surface of the star and jump conditions at the interface",
    "( see the next subsection ) .",
    "the surface boundary conditions we use are @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the lagrangian perturbation of the pressure , and @xmath89 .",
    "the latter two conditions come from the assumption that the perturbed magnetic field must be continuous to the outside field that is given by a scalar potential ( i.e. , @xmath90 ; cambell & papaloizou 1986 , cunha & gough 2000 , saio & gautschy 2004 ) .",
    "the inner boundary condition at the stellar center is the regularity condition of the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( e.g. , lee & saio 1986 ) .",
    "the jump conditions we apply at the interface are the continuity of the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the condition that the oscillation energy imparted by the perturbed magnetic field is lost from the wave system . to consider the latter condition , it is instructive to differentiate equation ( 18 ) with respect to @xmath93 to obtain @xmath94 where we have used equations ( 16 ) @xmath95 ( 20 ) to eliminate @xmath96 and @xmath97 . since the quantity @xmath98 can be very large in the interior , if we assume a wkbj type solution in the region near the interface such that @xmath99 , we obtain the wavenumber @xmath100 , which suggests the existence of very short magnetic perturbations .",
    "these short magnetic perturbation are attributable to the alfvn waves . in the deep interior where the gas pressure dominates the magnetic pressure so that @xmath101 , it may be legitimate to write @xmath102 where the functions with a subscript @xmath103 denote non - alfvnic perturbations and those with a subscript @xmath20 denote the alfvnic perturbations , and the former are assumed to have wavelengths much longer than the latter .",
    "for the non - alfvnic perturbations in the deep interior , we assume @xmath104 which is equivalent to equations ( a4 ) and ( a5 ) in lee & saio ( 1990 ) , and @xmath105 which comes from equation ( 4 ) assuming @xmath101 ( see  4 ) . using equations ( 30 ) to ( 32 ) in equations ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) , we obtain for the alfvnic perturbations @xmath106 @xmath107 defining @xmath108 we may formally rewrite equations ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) as @xmath109 where equations ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) have been used to eliminate @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and matrices @xmath32 and @xmath112 are determined by equations ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) . here , we regard equation ( 36 ) as a linear differential equation of @xmath113 with an inhomogeneous term @xmath114 . the homogeneous part of the linear differential equation is solved by assuming @xmath115 , where the wavenumber @xmath116 is obtained as eigenvalues to the equation @xmath117 .    to make the discussion more concrete , let us now consider a finite set of the linear differential equations , which is obtained by truncating the infinite expansions of perturbed quantities , keeping the first @xmath80 expansion coefficients for each perturbed quantity . in this case , the dimension of the vector @xmath113 is @xmath118 , and the number of eigenvalues @xmath116 to @xmath117 is also @xmath118 . to construct jump conditions at the interface , we pick up @xmath119 eigenvalues @xmath120 and the eigenfunctions @xmath121 that satisfy the condition @xmath122 or @xmath123 and write a general solution to equation ( 36 ) as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a special solution to equation ( 36 ) , and @xmath126 s are arbitrary constants . the condition",
    "( 37 ) means that the alfvnic perturbations are chosen to be running waves into the core ( e.g. , saio & gautschy 2004 ) .",
    "it is important to note that , different from the case of acoustic modes , the number of the eigenvalues @xmath120 that satisfy @xmath127 and @xmath128 is usually less than @xmath119 for rotational modes .",

    "the number of jump conditions supplied by equation ( 42 ) is @xmath131 , and since the continuity of the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 at the interface gives @xmath131 jump conditions , we have in total 2@xmath131 conditions at the interface .",
    "@xmath13-modes of non - magnetic polytropes were investigated , for example , by yoshida & lee ( 2000a , b ) .",
    "the coriolis force is the restoring force , and the oscillation frequency @xmath140 is proportional to the rotation frequency @xmath141 .",

    "as discussed in the previous section , the radial wavenumber of alfvnic perturbations near the interface may be approximately given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 , and @xmath152 with @xmath8 being the alfvn velocity denotes the traveling time for the alfvn waves .",
    "this equation indicates that alfvnic perturbations have very short wavelengths @xmath153 if the traveling time of the alfvn waves is much longer than the typical oscillation period of the modes .",

    "<S> we integrate linearized ideal mhd equations in the surface magnetic layer and non - magnetic oscillation equations in the core , and match the two integrations at the interface to obtain a complete solution . for a polytropic neutron star model of mass @xmath1 and radius @xmath2 cm , the magnetic dipole field becomes effective on the modal properties of the @xmath0-modes only when the field strength @xmath3 is much greater than @xmath4 g . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the damping effects caused by very short magnetic perturbations in the surface layer are not important for the @xmath0-mode instability of rapidly rotating neutron stars if the field strength @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath5 g .    </S>",
