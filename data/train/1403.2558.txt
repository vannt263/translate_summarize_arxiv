    "the standard luminosity function for galaxies ( lf ) in the last forty years has been represented by the schechter lf @xmath0 where @xmath1 sets the slope for low values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the characteristic luminosity and @xmath4 is the normalization , see @xcite .",
    "this lf is defined in the in the interval @xmath5 $ ] and has replaced other lfs presented by @xcite .",
    "the goodness of the fit can be evaluated by the merit function @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is number of data and the two indexes @xmath9 and @xmath10 stand for theoretical and astronomical , lf respectively . the value of @xmath11 which characterizes the schechter lf for a given astronomical catalog , i.e. the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in five different bands , represents a standard value to improve .",
    "many new lfs has been derived in the last years and we report some examples .",
    "a two - component schechter - like function is , see  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 this two - component lf defined between the maximum luminosity , @xmath14 , and the minimum luminosity , @xmath15 , has five parameters because two additional parameters have been added : @xmath16 which represents the magnitude where dwarfs first dominate over giants and @xmath17 which regulates the faint slope parameter for the dwarf population .    in order to fit the case of extremely low luminosity galaxies a double schechter lf with five parameters ,",

    "the strong dependence of lf on different environments such as voids , superclusters and supercluster cores was analyzed by @xcite with @xmath21 where @xmath1 is the exponent at low luminosities @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the exponent at high luminosities @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a parameter of transition between the two power laws , and @xmath26 is the characteristic luminosity .",
    "another lf starts from the probability density function ( pdf ) that models area and volumes of the voronoi diagrams and introduces the mass - luminosity relationship , see @xcite ; in the sdss case @xmath27 .",
    "a last example is represented by three new lfs deduced in the framework of generalized gamma pdf , see @xcite ; in the sdss case @xmath28 .",
    "all the previous lfs cover the range @xmath5 $ ] and therefore the analysis of finite upper and lower boundaries can be a subject of investigation .",
    "another interesting observational fact is that at low values of luminosity ( high absolute magnitude ) the observed lf has an approximate constant value .",
