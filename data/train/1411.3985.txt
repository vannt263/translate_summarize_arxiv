    "dispersion of particles in stochastic and turbulent flows is a key fundamental problem @xcite with applications in a huge number of disciplines going from atmospheric and ocean sciences @xcite , to environmental sciences @xcite , chemical engineering and astrophysics @xcite . at high reynolds numbers ,",
    "molecular diffusion makes a negligible contribution to spatial transport , and so turbulence dominates not only the transport of momentum , but also that of temperature , humidity , salinity and of any chemical species or concentration field .",
    "mixing can be approached from an eulerian point of view , studying the spatial and temporal evolution of a concentration field @xcite , and also by using a lagrangian approach in terms of the relative dispersion of pairs of particles @xcite . notwithstanding the enormous literature on the topic , a stochastic model for particle trajectories in turbulent flows",
    "whose basic assumptions are fully justified is yet to come @xcite .",
    "the modeling of pair dispersion for tracers was pioneered in @xcite , where a _",
    "locality assumption _ was introduced , see also @xcite for a recent historical review . in a modern language ,",
    "richardson s approach is built up in analogy with diffusion , replacing molecular fluctuations with turbulent fluctuations , acting differently at different scales .",
    "hence , in a turbulent flow , diffusivity is enhanced because the instantaneous separation rate depends on the local turbulent conditions encountered by pairs along their path : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the amplitude of the separation vector between the two particles , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a scalar eddy - diffusivity . for the eddy - diffusivity approach to be valid , separations @xmath8 have to be chosen larger than the initial ones , @xmath9 , and smaller than the integral scale of the flow , @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , time lags have to be large enough , so that the memory of the initial separation is lost .",
    "+ in the light of kolmogorov 1941 theory , ( see @xcite , the scalar eddy - diffusivity can be modeled as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the eulerian longitudinal velocity difference along the direction of particle separation @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a dimensionless constant , and @xmath16 is the rate of kinetic energy dissipation in the flow . in the above equation , @xmath17 is the correlation time of the lagrangian velocity differences at scale @xmath13 , @xmath18 ^ 2\\rangle } \\int_0^t \\langle \\delta_r { \\bf u}({\\bf r}(t),t ) \\cdot \\delta_r { \\bf u}({\\bf r}(s),s ) \\rangle\\ , ds\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : tau}\\ ] ] in the inertial range of scales , by dimensional considerations , we can write @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , from which the celebrated richardson s @xmath21 law of eqn .",
    "( [ eq:43 ] ) follows . as a consequence , eqn .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) predicts a super - diffusive growth for the particle separation : @xmath22 and the dependence on the initial conditions is quickly forgotten .",
    "in fact , when released into a fluid flow , tracer pairs separate ballistically at short time lags , _ ' a la _ batchelor @xcite , keeping memory of their initial longitudinal velocity difference , @xmath23 , up to time lags of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "only later on , richardson s super - diffusive regime follows .",
    "+ richardson s approach is exact if we assume that tracers disperse in a @xmath25correlated in time velocity field .",
    "in such a case , the probability density function ( pdf ) of observing two tracers at separation @xmath8 at time @xmath26 , @xmath27 , satisfies a fokker - planck diffusive equation with a space dependent diffusivity coefficient , @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath28\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a function of the velocity correlation evaluated at the current separation , only .",
    "+ the richardson equation ( [ eq : rich ] ) with initial condition @xmath29 can be solved , see e.g. , @xcite , and the solution has an asymptotic , large time form ( independent of the initial condition @xmath9 and @xmath30 ) of the kind : @xmath31 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a normalization constant .",
    "the richardson pdf is perfectly self - similar , so that all positive moments behave according to the dimensional law , @xmath33 .",
    "+ there are many reasons for which the richardson distribution can not exactly describe the behaviour of tracer pairs in real flows .",
    "the most important ones are : ( i ) the nature of the temporal correlations in the fluid flow @xcite ; ( ii ) the non - gaussian fluctuations of turbulent velocities @xcite ; ( iii ) the small - scale effects induced by the dissipation sub - range , and ( iv ) the large - scale effects induced by the flow correlation length .",
    "these last two are of course connected to finite reynolds - number effects . + it is worth noticing that formally any diffusion coefficient of the form @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , is compatible with the @xmath36 law , however different results",
    "would then be obtained for the functional form of @xmath37 @xcite . +     ( red ) and heavy particles with @xmath38 ( blue ) , simultaneously emitted from a source of size @xmath39 .",
    "trajectories are recorded from the emission time , up to the time @xmath40 after the emission.,width=377 ]    since richardson s seminal work , pair dispersion has been addressed in a large number of experimental and numerical studies , in the @xmath41 inverse energy cascade @xcite and in the direct enstrophy cascade ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as in the @xmath42 direct energy cascade @xcite , in convective turbulent flows @xcite and in synthetic flows @xcite . in @xcite , kinematic and direct numerical simulations",
    "have also been used to compare forward and backward relative dispersion in three dimensional turbulent flows .",
    "comprehensive reviews on the topic can be found in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite . + despite the huge amount of theoretical , numerical and experimental works devoted to this issue , it is fair to say that at the moment there is neither a clear consensus in favour of the richardson s approach , nor a clear disproof . the main practical reason is due to the fact that the predictions -if correct- , are applicable to tracer pairs whose evolution has been for all times in the inertial range of scales : @xmath43\\ , , \\label{eq : ic}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the viscous scale of the turbulent flow .",
    "in other words , we should record tracer dispersion at space and time scales _ unaffected _ by viscous or integral scale effects .",
    "this is of course a strong requirement which is particularly difficult to match in any experimental or numerical test because of the natural limitations in the accessible reynolds number @xmath45 , i.e. , in the scale separation range @xmath46 .",
    "moreover the viscous scale itself @xmath44 and the stretching rate at this scale are strongly fluctuating quantities in turbulent flows @xcite , causing further difficulties when pair statistics must be limited to a pure inertial range behaviour .",
    "it is worth noticing that a possible way out is to resort to exit - time statistics @xcite , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : exit ] .",
    "+ to avoid viscous effects on the pair dispersion statistics , it is also common to study pairs whose initial separation is well inside the inertial range , @xmath47 , paying the price to be dominated for long times by the initial condition and therefore mostly accessing the batchelor regime @xcite .",
    "alternatively , numerical simulations of particles evolving in stochastically generated velocity fields are a useful tool to describe ( possibly non gaussian and non self - similar ) inertial range pair dispersion @xcite .",
    "note however that kinematic simulations might lead to a mean - square separation of the particle pairs with a power law different from the richardson s law @xcite .",
    "+ for the reasons ( i)-(ii ) listed above , it is well possible that even in a infinite reynolds number limit , the richardson s prediction may turn out to be wrong",
    ". effects of time correlations have been discussed by many authors @xcite , in connection to the problem of the formally admissible _ infinite propagation speed _ present in any diffusive approach _",
    " la _ fokker - planck @xcite , and also in relation to the possible non - markovian nature of the lagrangian position and velocity process @xcite .",
    "+ summarising , it is extremely important to clarify with high accuracy if the deviations from richardson s theory observed in laboratory experiments and numerical simulations , at finite reynolds numbers , are due to sub - leading effects associated to the lack of scale - separation or not . in the latter case , it means that they would survive even in the @xmath48 limit .",
    "this is the aim of the research presented in this paper .",
    "+ we use direct numerical simulations of isotropic and homogeneous three dimensional turbulence at @xmath0 , seeded with an unprecedented number of particles ( emitted from localised sources in different locations inside the flow ) , in order to increase the total number of pairs starting with an initially small separation and to minimise local anisotropy and non - homogeneity . + we present results for both tracers and point - like heavy particles , without feedback on the flow as in the original problem attacked by richardson . when particles have inertia , new scenarios arise @xcite , because of the non homogeneous spatial distribution @xcite and the very intermittent nature of relative velocity increments characterised by the presence of quasi - singularities @xcite .",
    "+ not surprisingly , and in the absence of a theory , empirical observations are in this case even less stringent , also because of the need to specify the initial distributions of both particle positions and velocities .",
    "two types of experiments can be done with inertial particles .",
    "the first consists of studying relative dispersion as a function of the distribution of initial separations only . in practice",
    ", inertial particles are allowed to reach their stationary spatial and velocity distributions inside a bounded volume ( stationary distribution on a fractal dynamical attractor in phase - space ) , after which their dispersion properties are measured , conditioning on the initial distance @xcite .",
    "the second consists in directly injecting inertial particles in the flow , with prescribed initial velocity and separation distributions .",
    "the first protocol is more relevant to study relative dispersion properties in connection with spatial clustering , particularly effective at small stokes numbers ( e.g. , the spatial preferential concentration and trapping in coherent structures in the flow ) , and in connection with caustics , strongly modifying the relative velocities at large stokes numbers @xcite .",
    "the second protocol is more relevant in geophysical and industrial applications , where transient behaviours are crucial as in the case of volcanic eruptions , leakages of contaminants , or pollutant emissions .",
    "+ in this paper , we are interested in the latter case , for which we designed the simplest procedure of having inertial particles emitted in the same positions and with the same velocities of the tracers ( see figure  [ fig_two_stokes ] ) .",
    "this choice turns out to be optimal to better understand the statistics of tracers also , as it will become clearer in the sequel .",
    "the main results of the paper can be briefly anticipated .",
    "first , we quantify the importance of viscous - scale fluctuations for tracer separations , showing that they easily affect the separation evolution for time scales much larger than what predicted by the dimensional batchelor time , @xmath49 .",
    "this effect is so huge that , in current experiments , it spoils any possibility to assess tracer scaling properties in the _ expected _ inertial range of time scales . to overcome this problem",
    ", we suggest that heavy pairs can be used as dispersing particles that are able to dynamically filter out viscous - time fluctuations . by measuring pair dispersion of heavy pairs at different degree of inertia , we are able to observe a much clearer convergence towards an inertial - range regime for the relative separation .",
    "we interpret this result as an indication of the existence of infinite reynolds - number corrections to the richardson s prediction , as expected on the basis of a eulerian - lagrangian multifractal approach @xcite , yet never observed in real data . the multifractal approach ( mf ) is also used to determine a set of specific correlation moments involving powers of the pair separation distance and relative velocity of tracer pairs , which are expected to be statistically invariant along lagrangian trajectories in the inertial range @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we present the details of our numerical study . in section  [ sec : direct ] , we introduce the relative dispersion statistics for both tracers and heavy particles . in sub - section",

    "later on , we again notice the presence of many pairs with mutual separations much larger than the mean one .",
    "the trajectories of the heavy particles ( blue in the online version ) show a different evolution . after the emission , they tend to remain at a mutual distance of the order of @xmath44 for a very long time , thus dispersing much less .",

    "inertial particles behave as if their batchelor time was much longer than that of tracers ( in our dns the latter is small , @xmath86 , because the source is strongly localised ) .",
    "our main observation here is that the larger the stokes number , the longer is the filtering time that heavy particles apply to the local stretching properties of the carrying fluid : since inertia is moderate in the present experiment , this fact will allow us to have a very effective method to reduce effects from viscous scale fluctuations in the particles statistics and to better disentangle inertial range properties in the pair dispersion evolution . +",

    "the bunch emitted in a region where the stretching rate assumes the typical value exits the viscous region in a time lag of the order of @xmath58 , and soon approaches the inertial range behaviour compatible with @xmath97 .",
    "pairs belonging to the other bunch keep a small separation @xmath98 for a time lag up to @xmath99 , a time comparable to the integral time - scale @xmath59 , and never recover the @xmath94 scaling behaviour along the whole duration of our simulation .",
    "the examples shown in figure [ fig_2_bunches_r2 ] are meant to represent the huge variations that affect pair separation statistics for time lags of the order of @xmath58 .",
    "these variations are the hardest obstacle to assess pure _ inertial _ range properties in any experimental or numerical set - up , in addition to the challenge of following particle trajectories for a time lag long enough  and in a volume large enough .",
    "+ our idea here is to use heavy particles as _ smart _ passive , but dynamical , objects to filter out such huge viscous effects , without affecting the long - time and large - scale physics .",
    "indeed , heavy particles are less affected by fluctuations of the local viscous scale , since they respond to the fluid with their stokes time ( see figure [ fig_two_stokes ] ) . moreover ,",
    "heavy pairs experience a less fluctuating local stretching rate , as also measured by the distribution of the finite - time lyapunov exponents as a function of the stokes number @xcite .",

    "in other words , it is the quantitative counterpart of the big variations shown in the two examples in figure  [ fig_2_bunches_r2 ] .",
    "+ the filtering effect of the particle stokes time is the reason for which heavy pairs initially possess a smaller flatness .",
