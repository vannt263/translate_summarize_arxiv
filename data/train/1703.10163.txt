    "the latest observational studies show that many spiral galaxies have extended ultraviolet ( xuv ) disks with radii a couple of times larger than optical disks .",

    "( _ galex _ ) deep imaging data and sloan digital sky survey dr7 footprints @xcite .",
    "observational study of molecular clouds in the outermost disks such as xuv disks is essential to reveal their origin , because the uv emission is mainly emitted from young massive stars and those stars are formed in interstellar molecular clouds .",
    "since the molecular - hydrogen surface density ( @xmath16 ) of the outermost disks decreases to less than 1  @xmath11  pc@xmath17 , @xcite analyzed the deepest data for outermost disk of ngc 4625 down to 0.11  @xmath11  pc@xmath17 with a 1  kpc beam .",
    "however , the emission was not detected at the outermost region where star formation activities are shown and the  i surface density ( @xmath18 ) of @xmath19 2  @xmath11  pc@xmath17 .",
    "one of the reasons why emission was not detected is that observations for external galaxies can not reach enough spatial resolution and sensitivity .",
    "the milky way galaxy is the best target for finding molecular clouds in the outermost disk since it is the closest galaxy and molecular clouds are brighter and can be observed with better spatial resolution than any external galaxies .",
    "recent studies show that young stars are distributed beyond the galactocentric distance of @xmath20 20  kpc ( @xcite , @xcite ) . since these early - type stars are found in the outermost disk where @xmath18 decreases less than 1  @xmath11  pc@xmath17 , they are likely to form in the same environment as the outermost disk in external galaxies",
    ".    there have been many efforts to search for molecular clouds in the outermost disk of the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . found that molecular clouds are distributed up to @xmath20 20  kpc by observation towards _",
    "iras _ sources . however , an unbiased survey towards the outer galaxy is essential , because there are many molecular clouds without _",
    "iras _ sources . in the second galactic quadrant ,",
    "the molecular cloud at @xmath21  kpc was detected @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the latest outer galaxy survey with the 13.7  m telescope of the purple mountain observatory ( pmo ) discovered a lot of molecular clouds associated with a new arm beyond the outer ( cygnus ) arm @xcite .",
    "however , no survey towards the third galactic quadrant , where candidates of distant young stars found by @xcite , has yet been carried out .    in order to examine whether there exist distant molecular clouds in the third quadrant , we carried out wide field mapping observation with the nobeyama 45-m telescope .",
    "the multi - beam receiver bears ( 25-beam array receiver system ; @xcite ) enables us to conduct a wide - field unbiased molecular survey with high spatial resolution by observing in on - the - fly ( otf ) mode @xcite .",
    "this letter reports a discovery of the molecular cloud ( g213.042 + 0.003 ) , whose kinematic distance is the largest ( @xmath20 29@xmath22  kpc ) to date .",
    "we carried out mapping observations towards regions of @xmath1  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  and @xmath23 in the ( @xmath3 10 ) ( 115.271204  ghz )",

    ", we focus on the region of @xmath1  and @xmath23 , where g213.042@xmath00.003 was found .",
    "the beam size of the telescope was and the main beam efficiency @xmath24 was 34 % at 115 ghz .",
    "twenty - five bears beams were arrayed in a square of five rows and five lines with separation of .",
    "the beam array was oriented at an angle of seven degrees relative to the otf scan direction so that all separations of the scan tracks were equal to five arcseconds .",
    "the sampling interval along the scan path was three arcseconds .",
    "we took two orthogonal scan patterns in the galactic longitude and latitude directions in order to eliminate the scan pattern .",
    "the received signal was converted to the intermediate frequency ( if ) signal , which was sampled by a digital xf - type autocorrelator system ( ac45 ; @xcite ) with band width of 512  mhz and 1024 channels .",
    "the channel separations of frequency and velocity were 500  khz and 1.3  km  s@xmath7 at 115  ghz , and velocity resolution was 1.6  km  s@xmath7 using rectangle window function .",
    "the system noise temperature was typically 400  k in double sideband during the observations .",
    "we converted output signal into antenna temperature @xmath25 ( k ) to compensate for atmospheric attenuation using the chopper wheel method @xcite .",
    "we checked whether the pointing accuracy was within five arcseconds by observing point - like sio maser source , gx monocerotis , every hour and a half .",
    "we calibrated gain variation among 25 beams of bears by using the calibration table provided by nobeyama radio observatory , which was measured by observing w51 with bears and the ac45 correlator and with the s100 receiver and acousto - optical spectrometers ( aoss ) and by comparing them .",
    "we made three - dimensional fits cube using the software , nobeyama otf software tools for analysis and reduction ( nostar ) .",
    "the procedure was as follows ; ( 1 ) calibration of gain variation among 25 beams of bears , ( 2 ) subtraction of baseline by fitting with polynomial function , and ( 3 ) making the map of grid using the bessel @xmath9 gauss function as the convolution function . as a result",
    "the effective spatial resolution ( fwhm ) was @xcite .",
    "the edges of observed areas were not included in the final cube because of their large noise level . since the root mean square ( rms ) noise level ( @xmath26 ) was 0.22  k in @xmath27 scale , as small molecular cloud as 29  @xmath11 at the heliocentric distance of @xmath28 20  kpc can be detected with three sigma level . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath26 of outer galaxy survey with fcrao @xcite and pmo @xcite were 0.73 and 0.18  k with a velocity width of 1.3  km  s@xmath7 , respectively , corresponding @xmath29 of a molecular cloud at the heliocentric distance of 20  kpc were 2.0 @xmath9 10@xmath10 and 64  @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "therefore , our survey data enable us to detect more distant molecular clouds than ever .",
    "we used the dendrogram algorithm developed by @xcite to identify molecular clouds .",

    "we adopted parameters as @xmath33 3@xmath26 , @xmath34 2@xmath26 , and @xmath35 4 pixels and we defined trunks as molecular clouds in this letter . since this procedure sometimes misidentified noise as very small clouds , we excluded molecular cloud candidates with geometric mean of major and minor diameters smaller than the effective spatial resolution of and with line widths smaller than the velocity width of 1.3  km  s@xmath7 . furthermore , we focus on molecular cloud candidates whose local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity , @xmath36 , was within the range from 0 to 130  km  s@xmath7 so that the kinematic distance of clouds can be calculated .    .",
