    "the study of @xmath14 decays is turning into a fruitful source of hadron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the large mass of @xmath14 that allows the decay into many states , and its precise quantum numbers , permit a selection of channels in the decay modes where the quantum numbers can be induced with precision .",
    "it has also turned out a good tool to study the nature of some resonances , in particular those generated dynamically from the interaction of pairs of more elementary hadrons .",
    "pioneering work along this line was done in the study of @xmath14 decay into @xmath15 or @xmath16 and a scalar meson @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the idea is that there is a primary @xmath14 decay into a vector meson ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) and a pair of pseudoscalar mesons ( pp ) in a scalar state .",
    "simple arguments of su(3 ) symmetry allow to relate the couplings to the different pp channels and then these channels are allowed to undergo rescattering and generate resonances if this is the case , like the @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then up to a global normalization one can evaluate theoretically the mass distributions in different channels . a follow up of this idea",
    "was done in the study of the @xmath14 decay into @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath19 and some tensor resonances like the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the idea here is that the @xmath14 decay proceeds via decay into a @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath19 that acts as spectator in the reaction and another pair of vector mesons in a certain invariant mass region that interact to create the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath20 resonances , that , according to @xcite , are dynamically generated by the interaction of pairs of vectors . these pair of vector mesons rescatter after the primary production , producing the resonances that can be observed in the invariant mass distributions .    the results obtained in those former works and the good agreement with experiment gave extra support to the idea of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath20 as being quasimolecular states of two vectors for which other experimental support is also available @xcite .",
    "another source of support for this idea stems from the radiative @xmath14 decay into @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite . in this case",
    "the photon is radiated from the charmed quarks and a pair of vectors is primary formed , leading through rescattering to the formation of these resonances .    the arguments used to make predictions are very simple and general and can be easily extended to decays of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "taking advantage that some of these decays have become recently available , we study here this extension and make the theoretical predictions along the former lines comparing with data when available .",
    "the agreement of the results with the data available on @xmath23 to @xmath24 and @xmath25 is good and the same occurs with the decay of @xmath26 into @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we also make predictions for other related decays not yet available .",
    "we summarize here the formalism used in @xcite to study the decay of @xmath14 into @xmath31 and two interacting vectors that lead to the tensor state . by following the approach of @xcite",
    "we write the @xmath15 and @xmath16 as a combination of a singlet and an octet of su(3 ) states @xmath32    the two extra @xmath33 states combine to @xmath34 , either with @xmath35 or @xmath36 su(3 ) structure . by taking into account that the @xmath14 acts as a singlet state of su(3 ) , we obtained a matrix element for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 given by @xmath39 respectively .",
    "similarly for the @xmath40 and @xmath41 amplitudes we obtain @xmath42 respectively . here",
    "@xmath43 is the t matrix for the singlet of @xmath15 and the one of @xmath33 giving the vacuum and @xmath44 the corresponding part for the octet .",
    "then , up to a global normalization , all decay states were given in terms of the ratio @xmath45 @xmath46 it was also found in @xcite that in terms of @xmath33 the @xmath35 and @xmath36 components could be written as @xmath47 @xmath48    then the production of a resonance proceeds diagrammatically as depicted in fig .",
    "[ vertexj ]     and two interacting vector mesons . ]    only the terms in fig .",
    "[ vertexj ] where there is interaction of @xmath33 lead to the tensor resonance and hence this can be depicted by means of fig .",
    "[ jres ]     that go into resonance formation , omitting the coupling to @xmath49 without interaction . ]    the final transition matrix for @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the resonance studied , is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 are weights given in @xcite , @xmath54 the @xmath33 loop functions and @xmath55 the couplings of whichever resonance to the corresponding @xmath33 channel @xmath56 .",
    "the same can be done for @xmath57 or @xmath58 and all values of @xmath59 are tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 decay width is then given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 the momentum of the @xmath62 in the @xmath14 rest frame .    in principle",
    "the spectator @xmath63 could interact with one of the vectors of the interacting pair that leads to the resonance considered .",
    "however , an inspection of the kinematics shows that one is far away of any of the known resonances where this new pair could have a sizeable interaction .",
    "here we want to extend these ideas to the same decay channels but from the @xmath5 state . in terms of quarks",
    "the @xmath5 state is the @xmath64 state with the same quantum numbers as the @xmath14 , corresponding to a radial excitations to the @xmath65 state of a @xmath64 potential .",
    "one then expects the same dynamical features as for the @xmath14 , which stands as the @xmath66 @xmath64 state .",
    "only two dynamical features have been taken from the @xmath14 concerning theses decays .",
    "first that it is an su(3 ) singlet .",
    "this certainly can be said of the @xmath5 state too .",
    "the other dynamical feature was related to the ozi violation and the weight going into @xmath67 or @xmath68 in its decay , that we have parametrized in terms of the @xmath45 parameter of eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) .",
    "since this is also a dynamical feature not related to the internal excitation of the @xmath64 quarks in the potential well , we shall also assume that the @xmath45 parameter is the same for @xmath5 as for @xmath14 .",
    "with these two reasonable assumptions we can make predictions for the four ratios @xmath69 @xmath70 the values of these ratios with their theoretical uncertainties for the @xmath14 decay are given in table 7 of @xcite which we reproduce below in table [ table1:r ] . in order to get the ratios for @xmath5 we simply have to change the momenta that enter the formula of the width , eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) , since now the mass of @xmath5 is different from the one of @xmath14 .",
    "when this is corrected we find the values of table [ r2s ] ,    ccc & experiment&theory +   + @xmath71&0.22 - 0.47 @xmath72&0.13 - 0.61 @xmath73 + @xmath74&12.33 - 49.00 @xmath75&2.92 - 13.58 @xmath76 + @xmath77&11.21 - 23.08 @xmath78&6.18 - 19.15 @xmath79 + @xmath80&0.55 - 0.89 @xmath81&0.83 - 2.10 @xmath82 +    [ table1:r ]    where we compare with experimental values when possible .",
    "there is only the ratio @xmath83 directly available , but one experimental ratio , @xmath84 , can be obtained from the product of @xmath85 and we also show the results in table [ r2s ] .",
    "the theoretical errors are evaluated as in @xcite .",
    "hence the relative errors of each ratio @xmath86 are the same as for @xmath87 of table [ table1:r ] .",
    "the relative errors for the theoretical @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath84 are like those of @xmath71 , where they are biggest .    as we can see , the agreement of the theory with the experimental result is good , although one has large uncertainties in both cases .",
    "note , however , that even then , the agreement is not third aim , as one can see in table [ r2s ] , there are some times difference of a factor 40 between some of the ratios .    in table [ r2s ] we also make predictions for other ratios to allow comparison with future experiments that could be stimulated by the present findings .",

    "another successful test on the vector - vector nature of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances was done in @xcite looking at the radiative decay of @xmath14 into @xmath101 , with t any of these two tensor resonances . in @xcite",
    "it was justified that the photon was radiated from the initial @xmath64 state and a remaining @xmath64 decomposed into a pair of vector mesons which upon rescattering gave rise to the tensor resonances .",
    "the mechanism is deplicted in fig .",
    "[ f3 ]     decay into a photon and one dynamically generated resonance . ]",
    "the transition amplitude is given by @xmath102 and the weights @xmath103 are obtained in @xcite and given by @xmath104 where a is a normarlization constant , inoperative in the ratios , and @xmath105 , @xmath106 are again the loop functions of the intermediate @xmath33 states and the couplings of the resonance to these @xmath33 states .",
    "all the needed quantities for the evaluation of the amplitude are given in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the same theoretical framework allowed to evaluate the @xmath14 radiative decay into the scalar meson @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are also obtained from the interaction of @xmath33 , mostly @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "the decay width is given again by eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) where @xmath61 is now the momentum of the photon in the @xmath14 rest frame .",
    "radiative decays . ]    in the present case we want to extend these results to the decay of the @xmath109 .",
    "the only dynamical assumption made in @xcite was that the photon was radiated from the @xmath64 state , not from the final @xmath33 state .",
    "the argument was based on the dominance of the diagram of fig.[f4](a ) over the one of fig.[f4](b ) , which require two , versus three , gluon exchange as discussed in @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath64 state was assumed to be a singlet of su(3 ) like in the case of the former section .",
    "both assumptions hold equally here for the case of the @xmath110 in @xmath109 decay and , hence the only difference in the results stems from an overall normalization , which disappears when ratios are made , and the momenta @xmath61 in the formula of the width , since now the @xmath109 mass is different to the one of the @xmath14 . when this is taken into account , we evaluate the ratios that we define below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rtrs ] ) :    @xmath111    the results that we obtain are summarized in table [ ratio ] . as we can see , the agreement obtained with the data of @xcite , for @xmath112 , ( for @xmath113 decay ) , is good within theoretical and experimental uncertainties . in table iii , we also make predictions for the radiative decay into the scalar states and for the @xmath5 and @xmath114 states , for comparison with future experiments .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it should be noted that a simple quark model studied in @xcite gave ratios of the order of 2.2 for @xmath115 , which corrected by phase space would be now 2.0 for @xmath116 , a ratio compatible with data .",
    "the agreement with data of the molecular picture has to be put in addition to other magnitudes , as those of section ii to discriminate among models .",
    "yet , a striking disagreement with the data for the radiative decay would serve to invalidate the model .",
    "this stresses the value of the ratios discussed here .",
    "yet , it was also observed in @xcite that the ratio @xmath117 had small theoretical errors and was about one half the value of the quark model .",
    "so , this ratio is discriminative by itself and should motivate the search of radiative decays in the scalar sector .",
    "we have extended a test on the molecular nature of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath20 resonances , using the decay of @xmath14 into @xmath118 and any of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 resonances , or @xmath19 and @xmath20 , to the same decays from the @xmath26 state .",
    "the theory only makes use of the fact that both @xmath14 and @xmath26 are singlets of su(3 ) and there is a dynamical factor for the ozi violation into the strange and non strange sectors , the @xmath45 parameter . the needed modifications due to kinematics have been done and results for the decays of the @xmath26 are reported that are in agreement with experiment for the available data .",
    "predictions are also done for ratios not yet measured .",
    "on the other hand we also made the test of consistency on the nature of these states for the radiative decay of heavy quarkonium states , extending the test done for @xmath14 decay into @xmath119 and @xmath120 to the decay of the @xmath23 into these channels . in this case the common assumptions done is the su(3 ) singlet nature of the @xmath14 and the @xmath23 and the fact that qcd dynamics strongly favors the radiation of the photon from the quarkonium state instead of being from the final state of two vector mesons .",
    "once again , the agreement of the results with the experimental ratio for the decay of the @xmath23 into @xmath119 and @xmath120 is good , and we make predictions for the decays into @xmath121 and @xmath122 to be compared with future experiments",
    ". we also make predictions for these radiative decays from the @xmath5 and @xmath123 states .",
    "the work done here shows the power of using decays of heavy quarkonium into states which are dynamically generated .",
    "it puts constraints on the ratios of some of the decay channels that , if fulfilled , give us more confidence in the molecular picture emerging for these states from a dynamical study of the interaction of pairs of hadrons .",
    "future experiments , determining gradually the ratios evaluated for which there are not yet experimental data , will set further tests for the structure of these resonances .",
