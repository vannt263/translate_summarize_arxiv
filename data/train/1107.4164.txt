    "the exploration / exploitation trade - off is an important issue in evolutionary computation . by tuning the selective pressure on the population",
    ", one can find an optimal ( or near - optimal ) tradeoff between exploitation and exploration . in cellular evolutionary algorithms ( ceas ) , the population is embedded on a bidimensional toroidal grid and each solution interacts with its neighbors thanks to a certain neighborhood .",
    "the convergence rate of the algorithm is then dependent of the shape and size of the grid and of the neighborhood .",
    "the smallest symetric neighborhood that can be defined is the well - known von neumann neighborhood of radius @xmath0 .",
    "it guarantees a slow isotropic diffusion of genetic information through the grid .",
    "but when solving complex multimodal problems , it is necessary to slow down even more the propagation speed of the best solution because the algorithm still often converges over a local optimum .    our goal in this paper is to establish a relation between the selective pressure on the population and the effects of recombination and mutation operators , in order to find an optimal exploration / exploitation trade - off .",
    "to do so , we propose a new selection scheme able to control the selective pressure and a theoretical model which takes into account the effects of stochastic variations on an optimization problem . in section 2",
    "we define a selection scheme able to tune the selective pressure and present the algorithm used in the experiments . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the selective pressure with respect to the selection method and present a new model which takes into account the stochastic variations . in section 4",
    "we present performances on quadratic assignment problem instances and on nk - landscapes and we explain the results with the model proposed .      a cellular evolutionary algorithm",
    "( cea ) @xcite is an ea in which the population is embedded on a bidimensionnal toroidal grid ( see figure [ cea ] ) .",
    "each cell of the grid contains a solution .",
    "embedding the solutions on a grid allows defining a neighborhood between the cells .",
    "the most commonly used one in ceas is the von neumann neighborhood ( shown on figure [ cea ] ) . at each generation , every cell on the grid is updated by selecting parents in its neighborhood and applying stochastic operators such as crossover and mutation .",
    "several strategies exist , synchronous and asynchronous , to update the cells .",
    "the small overlapped neighborhoods guarantee the diffusion of solutions through the grid @xcite .",
    "such algorithms are especially well suited for complex problems @xcite and are of advantage when dealing with dynamic problems @xcite .      one of the main properties that differs between eas and ceas is the rate of convergence ( propagation speed of the best solution ) : it is exponential for eas and quadratic for ceas",
    ". therefore , the selective pressure on the population is weaker for a cea than for an ea .",
    "controlling the selective pressure is critical since it can avoid premature convergence of the algorithm when solving complex multimodal problems .",
    "several parameters related to the selective pressure can prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in a local optimum .",
    "the topology of the grid , the local neighborhood , the properties of the selection operator are such parameters . by correctly tuning these parameters for a given problem",
    ", one can find a good exploration / exploitation tradeoff and minimize the risks of premature convergence .",
    "_ established a link between the radius of the neighborhood and the radius of the grid : changing this ratio directly affects the selective pressure on the population @xcite .",
    "analyzed performances of ceas with a fixed size neighborhood and different grid shapes .",
    "they arrived to the conclusion that thin grids are well - suited for complex multi modal problems and large grids are well - suited for simple problems .",
    "the main explanation is that thinner grids give lower selective pressure @xcite .",
    "takeover times and growth curves analysis are useful to measure the selective pressure on a population , but it is not sufficient to decide of a trade - off between exploration and exploitation : it is necessary to include effects of the stochastic variations due to the operators in the analysis .",
    "proposed a hierarchical cea which allows achieving different levels of exploration /exploitation tradeoff in distinct zones of the population simultaneously @xcite .    a standard technique to study the induced selective pressure without introducing the perturbing effect of variation operators is to let selection be the only active operator , and then monitor the number of best solution copies in the population @xcite .",
    "the takeover time is the time needed for one single best solution to colonize the population with selection as the only active operator .",
    "let @xmath1 be the size of the population , @xmath2 the number of generations and @xmath3 the number of best solution copies at generation @xmath2 .",
    "the population is initialized with one solution of good fitness and @xmath4 solutions of null fitness . since no other evolution mechanism but",
    "selection takes place , the good fitness solution spreads over the grid .",
    "the takeover time is then the smaller time @xmath2 such that @xmath5 . analysing the growth of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 also gives an indication on the selective pressure .",
    "it shows the convergence rate of the algorithm when selection is the only active operator . when the slope of the growth curve of @xmath3 is low",
    ", the convergence rate is low and the takeover time is high . on the other hand , a high slope of the growth curve leads to a short takeover time . in the first case ,",
    "the selective pressure on the population is weaker than in the second case .      characterizing the growth curves and",
    "the takeover time is an important issue in the study of the selective pressure @xcite .",
    "many models have been proposed to define the behaviour of structured population evolutionary algorithms .",
    "sarma and de jong proposed a logistic model in which the coefficient of the growth curve of the best solution is shown to be an inverse exponential of the ratio between radii of the neighborhood and the underlying grid @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was guided by an empirical analysis of the effects on the convergence rate and the takeover time of several neighborhood sizes and shapes .",
    "sprave proposed a hypergraph based model of population structures and a method for the estimation of growth curves and takeover times based on the probabilistic diameter of the population @xcite .",
    "gorges - schleuter proposed a study about takeover time and growth curves for cellular evolution strategies .",
    "she obtained a linear model for ring populations and a quadratic model for a torus population structure @xcite .",
    "several authors wrote about theoretical or empirical models of growth curves and takeover time .",

    "_ proposed a model for cellular evolutionary algorithms with asynchronous update policies @xcite .",
    "he summarized his results and proposed models for synchronous updates @xcite that will be evoked later in this paper .",

    ", he made an interesting review of existing models and compared two of them ( the logistic model and the hypergraph model ) with his newly proposed one .",
    "for a detailed state of the art of ceas , see @xcite .",
    "in this section we present a new selection scheme for ceas that allows tuning accurately the selective pressure .    * * centricselection**index : int , @xmath6 : double neighbors @xmath7 getneighborhood(index ) @xmath8",
    "@xmath7 select(neighbors , @xmath6 ) @xmath9 @xmath7 select(neighbors , @xmath6 ) best(@xmath8 , @xmath9 )    the centric selection ( cs ) idea is to change the probability of selecting the center cell of the neighborhood .",
    "this scheme allows slowing down the convergence speed while keeping an isotropic diffusion of good solutions through the grid .",
    "the cs is a determinist tournament selection .",
    "but unlike the standard deterministic tournament , cells in the neighborhood may have different probabilities of being selected for the competition .",
    "the anisotropic selection @xcite is another selection scheme which modifies the probability of selection a cell for a deterministic tournament . with the anisotropic selection ,",
    "the diffusion of solutions is not isotropic , so we propose the cs which is easier to study .",
    "we have @xmath10 the probability of selecting the center cell and @xmath11 the probability of selecting either north , south , east or west cell . when @xmath12 , all cells have the same probability of being selected for the competition : this particular case of cs is the standard binary tournament selection . when @xmath13 , only the center cell can be selected for the tournament : in this particular case where the same solution is selected two times , the crossover operator is not applied in the cea .",
    "only mutations are applied to the solution , and with an elitist replacement strategy , the algorithm behaves as the parallelisation of as many hill climbers as there are solutions in the population .",
    "the cs is described in algorithm [ centricalgo ] .",
    "the candidates compete in a deterministic tournament returning the best one .",
    "for each cell on the grid , two parents are selected per generation , as we can see in the algorithm [ cealgo ] .",
    "stochastic variations operators are applied to the parents , generating two children .",

    "in this section , we present two models of the search dynamic in ceas . in the first one , the equilibrium model ( em ) we consider that the optimal solution has been found and observe how it colonizes the grid .",
    "this model is classical in the studies on the selective pressure and one the exploration / exploitation trade - off .",
    "the informations given by this model are takeover times and best solution growth curves .",
    "as the stochastic variations operators are not taken into account , the same dynamic occurs in experimental runs when the recombination and mutation operators are ineffective : when the system has reached an equilibrium .    in the second one , we consider that a better solution can be found with a certain probability and observe the frequency of apparition of this new solution with respect to our algorithm s parameters .",
    "it is a model of the transition between two periods of fitness stability .",
    "we call this new model the punctuated equilibria model ( pem ) .      in order to measure the selective pressure induced by the cs",
    ", we observe what happens when no more solution improvement is possible . in this case ,",
    "crossover and mutation are no longer useful and the evolution process has reached an equilibrium .",
    "hence , we observe the time needed for a single best solution to conquer the whole grid , and look at the growth curve obtained and the takeover time .",
    "we measure the effects of cs on selective pressure by observing these growth curves and takeover times on a square grid of side @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ fig - tak - fuzzy ] shows the takeover time as a function of @xmath6 . the takeover time is not defined for @xmath13 .",
    "the selective pressure drops when the value of @xmath6 increases .",
    "we can see on figure [ growthpc ] the growth of the number of copies of the best solution in the population ( top ) and its growth rate ( bottom ) .",
    "there are two stages in the shape of the curve .",
    "the growth rate is linear in the first part and quadratic in the second part .",
    "when using this selection scheme , the diffusion of the best solution is still isotropic .",
    "so the best solution roughly propagates describing an obtuse square as long as no side of the grid is reached .",
    "this corresponds to the first part of the growth rate curve .",
    "once the sides are reached by some copies of the best solution , the dynamic changes as we can observe on the second part of the growth rate curves .",
    "c +   +      in this section , we propose a new model which will help in the understanding of the search dynamics of an evolutionary algorithm .",
    "this model was first designed for a cellular ea but can be easily extended to any kind of evolutionary algorithm .",
    "we consider a cea initialized with random solutions .",
    "we make sure that the best solution in the population is unique .",
    "our goal is to simulate an evolutionary run : we simulate recombination and mutation operators with probabilities that the mating is efficient or not ( i.e. produces a new best solution ) .",
    "we consider three different types of matings : between two copies of the best solution ( mating @xmath20 ) , between one copy of the best solution and one sub - optimal solution ( mating @xmath21 ) and between two sub - optimal solutions ( mating @xmath22 ) .",
    "we introduce probabilities @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 that matings of type @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 produce a new best solution , fitter than the previous best one . figure [ run ] is an example of evolutionary run on some optimization problem ( minimisation task ) .",
    "we can see that there are some stagnation periods where the best solution do nt improve .",
    "then , an amelioration occurs and the population enters another stability period .",
    "an evolutionary run is a sum of stagnation periods and punctual improvements .",
    "our punctuated equilibria model computes the probability of improving the best solution in the population according to the variables described above .    with this model ,",
    "the probability of finding a new best solution at a given generation @xmath2 is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the number of matings of each type for the generation @xmath2 .    the average time to find a new best solution",

    "the model could be used to explain the probability and the time to find a new best solution according to the selective pressure , and also to tune the value of parameters which have an impact on the selective pressure , such as @xmath6 , to have the highest probability to evolve toward a new best solution .",
    "equation [ eq - optimal ] gives precisely the best exploration and exploitation tradeoff and allows computing the optimal value of @xmath6 ( in our case ) for this trade - off . in the following",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the exploration / exploitation trade - off in cellular genetic algorithms . we define a new selection scheme , the centric selection , which is tunable and allows controlling the selective pressure with a single parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium model is used to study the influence of the centric selection on the selective pressure and a new model which takes into account problem dependent statistics and selective pressure in order to deal with the exploration / exploitation trade - off is proposed : the punctuated equilibria model . </S>",
    "<S> performances on the quadratic assignment problem and nk - landscapes put in evidence an optimal exploration / exploitation trade - off on both of the classes of problems . </S>",
    "<S> the punctuated equilibria model is used to explain these results . </S>"
