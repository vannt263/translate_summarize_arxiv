    "the observations are briefly presented . in sect.[sec : texc ] the cii fine structure excitation temperature , which gives directly the upper limit on the cmb temperature at redshift 3.0543 , is derived . in sect.[sec : mechanisms ] the relative strengths of the different excitation mechanisms are reviewed .",
    "the constraints on the density and the uv field in the @xmath1 damped ly@xmath2 system are derived in sect.[sec : results ] and discussed in sect.[sec : disc ] .",
    "in october 1990 echelle observations of q0000@xmath32619 at @xmath13 were obtained with the eso multi mode instrument ( emmi ) ( @xcite ) at the eso ntt telescope .",

    "the excitation temperature of 21.6 k provides a strict upper limit on the temperature of the cmb at the absorber redshift of 3.0543 ; this upper limit would hold even if the cii@xmath0 absorption were a spurious effect of the lyman forest .",

    "the excitation temperature provides a strict upper limit to the cmb temperature as other sources may contribute appreciably to the excitation .",
    "in fact , if the cii@xmath0 absorption is not a spurious effect of the line forest , other mechanisms have to be at play to explain an excitation temperature of at least 19.6 k. the possible excitation mechanisms are reviewed in the next section .",
    "the higher fine - structure states of a ground state multiplet can be populated by ( 1 ) particle collisions , ( 2 ) direct excitation by infrared photons and ( 3 ) indirect excitation by ultraviolet photons .",
    "the equilibrium between the excitation and de - excitation of the cii @xmath38 fine structure is described by :    @xmath39    here the collision excitation rate is expressed as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the temperature averaged product between the cross - section and the particle velocity and @xmath42 is the particle density , @xmath43 h , @xmath44 .",

    "rewrite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively the collisional excitation rate , the einstein probability coefficient for induced transition and the uv pumping rate , all divided by @xmath48 . in order to establish the importance of the various factors in determining the observed population ratio in the fine structure levels of cii , we need to evaluate the magnitude of each term in this equation .      the particles which may be responsible for collisional excitation are essentially electrons , protons and atomic hydrogen , with different contributions dominating in different temperature and ionization regimes .",
    "the expression for the rate of collisional excitation by electrons is given in @xcite and , by using the detailed computation of the effective collisional strength given in @xcite and @xcite , one obtains typically @xmath55 @xmath56 for @xmath57 k and @xmath58 @xmath56 for @xmath59 k.    the excitation rates as a function of electron temperature for neutral hydrogen collisions are also given in @xcite and for @xmath57 k @xmath60 @xmath56 , for @xmath59 k @xmath61 @xmath56 .",
    "the electron collision term will dominate the hydrogen collision term for @xmath62 at @xmath57 k and for @xmath63 at @xmath59 k. if the plasma is collisionally ionized the electron collision term will be the dominant one for temperature @xmath64 k , when the fraction of ionized hydrogen becomes significant ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the absorbing medium is significantly photoionized and @xmath63 the electron collision term will be the dominant term at any kinetic temperature whereas if photoionization is not signficant and @xmath65 hydrogen collisions will dominate .",
    "the cii excitation rate for proton collision becomes comparable to the electron contribution only for temperatures @xmath66 k ( @xcite ) , but at these temperatures cii is completely destroyed by collisional ionization ( @xcite ) .",

    "since the cmb radiation has a black body spectrum the direct excitation rate from cmb photons can be expressed as : @xmath73 as we have seen , the big bang model predicts the cmb temperature to be 11.05 k at this redshift , moreover the upper limit on the cmb temperature at @xmath74 set by @xcite , constrains the cmb temperature empirically . if we assume that the cmb temperature varies monotonically with @xmath6 : @xmath75 then the measure of @xcite gives @xmath76 between @xmath77 and @xmath74 , that is @xmath78 k at @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that @xmath79 must be lower than @xmath80  s@xmath35 , i.e. only a minor contribution to the derived population ratio in our system , where @xmath81 for cii is between 0.02 and 0.03 ( table [ tab : cii ] ) . as a first approximation therefore this term",
    "can be neglected and the same is true for @xmath82 .",
    "an infrared photon flux with an intensity comparable to the one measured in the galactic plane ( @xcite , @xcite ) would correspond to an excitation rate at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the one for a cmb photon flux with @xmath83 k and can be ignored .",
    "the other important type of photon excitation is uv photon pumping .",
    "after the absorption of a photon an atom will usually cascade back through a variety of states , sometimes reaching levels that could not be populated by direct radiative upward transition from the ground state .",
    "if @xmath84 represents all the quantum numbers for one of the upper levels , reached by photon absorption , the transition rate from level 0 to level 1 , is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the fraction of downward transitions from level @xmath84 that populate level 1 , when the atom first reaches the group of lower levels .",
    "for transitions within a multiplet the values of @xmath87 are tabulated ( e.g. @xcite ) . to evaluate @xmath88 we considered all the direct upward transitions from cii ground state @xmath89 , longwards of 900  : @xmath90 @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath90 @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath90 @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) . for the uv field we adopted the milky way spectral energy distribution ( sed ) given by @xcite with a milky way intensity at 912   of @xmath97 ( @xcite ) , obtaining : @xmath98 that is @xmath99   by using the uv intensity field and sed given in @xcite ] . since the uv pumping de - excitation rate",
    "@xmath100 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath101 , the uv de - excitation term can also be omitted in eq.(4 ) , for any likely uv flux intensity and sed .",
    "the final shape of the balance equation is : @xmath102 with the collisional term being dominated by the electrons or hydrogen atoms contribution according to the absorber ionization degree .",
    "the uv field can also be expressed in terms of the hydrogen density through the ionization parameter , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the surface flux of hydrogen - ionizing photons .",
    "if we assume a uv flux having the milky way sed given in @xcite , @xmath105 and : @xmath106 } \\label{eq : final}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the fraction of particle @xmath108 with respect to the hydrogen density .",
    "from the ratio cii / civ observed in our data at @xmath109 som derived @xmath110 and assuming solar abundance ratios a consistent fit to the data was obtained with @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( som ) .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : cii ] , the derived excitation temperature for the levels @xmath28 and @xmath29 of cii for the damped ly@xmath2 absorber toward q0000@xmath32619 at @xmath109 is between 19.6 and 21.6 k. we can use these values and expression [ eq : final ] to constrain the density and uv flux at the absorber .",
    "however , in order to evaluate eq.([eq : final ] ) , we need to make an assumption about the ionization degree of the gas in the absorber .",
    "since the efficiency of the electron and hydrogen collisional is very different , the collisional excitation term depends critically on the gas ionization degree . to illustrate this we will consider two limiting cases for the absorbing cloud : a quasi - neutral gas , for which @xmath113 , and a 10% ionized plasma .    in fig.[fig :",
    "texneutral ] the result of eq.([eq : final ] ) is plotted , in the case of a quasi - neutral gas , where the collisional excitation is due to collisions with atomic hydrogen .",
    "the horizontal continuous line gives the upper limit on the excitation temperature .",
    "the points where the curves intersect this line correspond to the density values above which the collisional excitation would be such that the excitation temperature would be higher than the measured value .",
    "this is a forbidden region .",
    "the density of the absorber must thus be lower than 40 @xmath4 .",
    "this is a strict upper limit .",
    "higher values of the ionization parameters would move the intersection point to lower density values .",
    "if the cii@xmath0 absorbing line is a spurious effect of the lyman forest , then the cii@xmath0 equivalent width must be lower than the one we measured and the upper limit on the density must be lower ; increasing the cloud kinetic temperature also moves the density - limit to lower values . with @xmath111",
    "the upper limit on the absorber density is 20 @xmath4 .",
    "the shaded area in the figure corresponds to the interval of the derived excitation temperature for the absorber toward q0000@xmath32619 .",
    "the intersection of the long - dashed curve with the lower bound of this area provides a lower limit of 10 @xmath114 to the density of the system , if the gas is quasi - neutral ( @xmath115 ) .    in fig.[fig :",
    "texionized ] , cii fine structure excitation temperature is plotted as a function of the absorber density ( like in fig.[fig : texneutral ] ) this time for the case of a 10% ionized plasma .",
    "electron collisions dominate collisional excitation in this case and because electron collisions are more efficient than atomic collisions , lower gas densities are required to achieve the same level of cii fine structure excitation . from fig.[fig : texionized ] one derives that with ionization parameter @xmath116 the range of possible gas densities is between 1 and 5 @xmath114 .",
    "we note however that the exact value of the ionization parameter has little effect on the position of the intersect for the curves in fig.[fig : texionized ] . for any @xmath117 ( thick  dotted line )",
    "we obtain that @xmath118 must be greater than 0.7 @xmath114 , with the same 10% ionization and temperature range .",
    "an ionization parameter of @xmath119 at a density of 0.7 @xmath114 correspond to a uv flux at 912   of 20 times the galactic uv field ( if the same sed is assumed ) .",
    "these simple considerations allow us to constrain the absorber density to the range of 0.7 @xmath3 40 @xmath114 , for a gas kinetic temperature between 100 and 10000 k and ionization degree between 0 and 10% .",
    "an ionization degree between 0 and 100% would imply possible absorber densities in the range 0.1 @xmath3 40 @xmath114 .",
    "an ionization parameter @xmath116 and the density range 1.0 @xmath3 40 @xmath114 imply a uv field with h - ionizing photon flux ranging from 2 to 80 times the galactic h - ionizing flux .",

    "the observed excitation temperature ( or upper limit ) of ci and cii fine structure has been used to constrain the density of the absorbing systems by several authors and the published values are very similar to the upper limit derived here . @xcite observed absorption from the first fine - structure level of ci in a cloud belonging to a damped ly@xmath2 system at a redshift of 1.776 , towards the quasar q1331@xmath120170 .",
    "they measured an excitation temperature of @xmath121 k , while the cmb temperature at this redshift is predicted to be 7.58 k. from their measure they derive a 1@xmath21 upper limit for the cloud density of @xmath122 @xmath4 for a cloud kinetic temperature of 100 k and of @xmath123 @xmath4 for a cloud kinetic temperature of 1000 k , given that the cmb is at the predicted temperature .",
    "@xcite detected absorption from the ground state and the excited state of ci and cii in the @xmath124 damped ly@xmath2 system of q0013@xmath3004 .",

    "these values are then combined with the measured ci excitation temperature to derive an upper limit of @xmath130 k or @xmath131 k respectively on the temperature of the cmb at this redshift , with the first value as their best guess , based on photo - ionization modeling of the absorbing cloud .    to constrain the density and uv field of the @xmath1 absorber of q0000@xmath32619",
    "we have considered a gas kinetic temperature in the range 100@xmath310000 k. there are not many observational constraints on the gas temperature of damped ly@xmath2 systems .",

    "not being directly comparable with the measure of the spin temperature in a damped ly@xmath2 system , a @xmath134 k suggests that for a given total neutral hydrogen column density , the damped ly@xmath2 system contains a larger percentage of warm phase gas ( @xmath135 k ) than is seen in typical galactic lines of sight ( @xcite ) .",

    "it has been proposed that the dlas with neutral hydrogen column density @xmath11(hi)@xmath137 , are large and massive galactic disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) with typical sizes of a few kpc .",
    "the constraints we derived for this damped system at @xmath1 indicate that the size of this absorber is of the order of the size of giant hydrogen clouds in our galaxy or of a galactic disk seen face - on .",

    "this value provides a strict upper limit on the temperature of the cmb at @xmath109 , which at this redshift is predicted to be 11.05 k. we then used the derived relative populations of the fine structure levels of cii to set constraints on the absorber density and on the uv field in the absorbing cloud . assuming an ionization degree ranging from 0 to 10% , a gas kinetic temperature between 100 and 10000 k and a uv field with a milky way spectrum , the density of the absorber is constrained to be between 0.7 and 40 @xmath4 and the h - ionizing flux between @xmath138 and @xmath139 , that is between 1 and 80 times the intensity of the galactic uv field .",
