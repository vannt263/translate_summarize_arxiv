    "we derive local properties of @xmath0 at any @xmath3-fixed point @xmath4 .",
    "it should be noted that the local properties of schubert varieties at @xmath3-fixed points determine their local properties at all other points , because of the @xmath5-action ; but this does not extend to richardson varieties , since richardson varieties only have a @xmath3-action .    in kodiyalam - raghavan @xcite and kreiman - lakshmibai @xcite , an explicit grbner basis for the ideal of the tangent cone of the schubert variety @xmath1 at @xmath4",

    "the key to their proofs was to use a version of the robinson - schensted - knuth correspondence ( which we shall call the ` ordinary ' rsk ) in order to establish a degree - preserving bijection between a set of monomials defined by an initial ideal and a ` standard monomial basis ' .",
    "the difficulty in generalizing this method of proof to the case of schubert varieties at an arbitrary @xmath3-fixed point @xmath4 lies in generalizing this bijection .",
    "all three of @xcite , @xcite , and this paper obtain generalizations of this bijection .",
    "the three generalizations , when restricted to schubert varieties , are in fact the same bijection , although this is not immediately apparent .",
    "although the formulations of the bijection in @xcite and @xcite are similar to eachother , our formulation is in terms of different combinatorial indexing sets , and thus most of our combinatorial definitions and proofs are of a different nature than those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relationship between our formulation and the formulations in @xcite and @xcite is analogous to the relationship between the robinson - schensted correspondence and viennot s version of the robinson - schensted correspondence @xcite .",
    "we formulate the bijection by introducing a generalization of the ordinary rsk , which we call the bounded rsk . because the definition of the bounded rsk is built from that of the ordinary rsk , many properties of the bounded rsk are immediate consequences of analogous properties for the ordinary rsk ( see @xcite ) .",
