    "very little is known about the magnetic field , mainly because the polarized radio emission is very weak and superimposed onto extended emission from a foreground galactic spur ( berkhuijsen @xcite ; grve et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the radio disk in galaxies often is radially more extended than the optical disk , sometimes also vertically .",
    "for example , radially extended radio emission was detected in m51 ( see fig.1 of berkhuijsen et al .",
    "radio emission extending far away from the galactic plane was observed from ngc 4631 ( hummel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ngc 891 ( sukumar & allen @xcite ) and a few other galaxies ( eg . ngc 3432 by english & irwin @xcite ) . in m31 ,",
    "extended hi and optical emission was detected up to more than @xmath1 from the center along the minor axis ( emerson @xcite ; innanen et al .",
    "however , the radio emission seems not that extended and the existence of a radio halo in m31 is still uncertain ( eg .",

    "@xcite ) and rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources have revealed the existence of an extended magneto - ionic disk ( clegg et al .",

    ", we will investigate the extended magneto - ionic disk in m31 .",
    "the detection of the regular magnetic field outside the `` ring '' , either interior to the `` ring '' or in the outer spiral arms or halo , will constrain the theoretical models for the type and origin of the field ( eg .",
    "poezd et al .",
    "@xcite ; howard & kulsrud @xcite ) .",
    "a field residing just in the `` ring '' is very difficult to understand in the frame - work of a primordial field origin .",
    "more seriously , a dynamo can not generate a field that is limited to a given small range of radius",
    ". the field should be much more extended ( moss et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and should have another weaker ring exterior ( ruzmaikin et al .",
    "@xcite ) or interior to the observed `` ring '' ( moss et al .",
    "the emission possibly detected interior to the `` ring '' from the inner arms ( eg .",
    "beck @xcite ; berkhuijsen et al .",
    "@xcite ) is too weak for a measurement of the regular field .",
    "m31 is a nearby spiral galaxy which optically extends more than @xmath2 along the major axis on the sky .",
    "there are a number of polarized background radio sources in the field of m31 , which can be used as probes of the magneto - ionic medium in m31 .",
    "if the magnetic structure in the halo or extended disk is somewhat ordered , the rotation measures ( rms ) of these sources should have systematic deviations from the average .",
    "we observed 21 polarized radio sources with the vla in 6 fields in the direction of m31 at two frequencies , and determined their rms from the observed position angles ( pas ) .",
    "we present the observations and data reduction in sect.2 , the results in sect.3 , and discuss them in sect.4 .",
    "+ notes : ( 1 ) azimuthal angles @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are shown in fig.1 . just for these values , they are the same in the plane of sky and in the plane of m31 .",
    "( 2 ) we assumed an inclination of @xmath7 and a distance to m31 of 690 kpc .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field in m31 results in a systematic rm variation around the observed `` ring '' ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the slight phase shift of the rm curve ( rm@xmath8 at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) is due to the pitch angle of the field in the `` ring '' .",
    "a detailed discussion of this rm variation , including the big jumps ( beck 1982 ) near @xmath11 and @xmath12/@xmath13 , will be given by berkhuijsen et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the field in the `` ring '' contributes to rms of the discrete sources if they are located behind the `` ring '' .",
    "however , if a source has a large angular separation from the `` ring '' , then the field in the `` ring '' will not affect its rm unless the field extends to that large radius . in table 3 , we give the apparent radial distances @xmath14 of the sources from the m31 center and their azimuthal angle @xmath15 , both in the galactic plane of m31 .",
    "these two parameters indicate which part of m31 affects the observed rm of the background sources . with an inclination angle of @xmath7 ( eg .",
    "braun @xcite ; ma et al .",
    "@xcite ) and a distance , implying a larger distance to m31 of @xmath16 kpc . for comparison with earlier work",
    ", we use 690 kpc . ] to m31 of 690 kpc ( baade & swope @xcite ) , @xmath17 corresponds to 200 pc in the plane of m31 along the major axis . the azimuthal angle increases counter - clockwise from @xmath12 on the northern major axis to east ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we plotted the observed rms of discrete sources onto fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with different symbols indicating the range of apparent distances to the center of m31 .",
    "most of the observed sources are near the azimuthal angles @xmath18 and @xmath6 ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , and therefore have a rm not deviating much from the average rm or from the rm variation of the `` ring '' , except for a few .",
    "three sources interior to the `` ring '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) with quite different azimuthal angles @xmath15 have apparent distances less than 8.0 kpc ( tab.2 ) and are located far from the minor axis of m31 .",
    "note that two of them , 37w188 ( rm = @xmath19 ) and 37w91 ( rm = @xmath20 ) , have rms quite consistent with those of the continuum `` ring '' .",
    "first of all , this indicates that the field with the same structure as in the `` ring '' also extends to the inner part of m31 .",
    "second , the field very probably has an even mode , eg . no field reversal below and above the galactic plane of m31 .",
    "otherwise there should be no net rm from m31 .",
    "third , this means that the strength of the regular magnetic field has about one half of the strength compared to that in the `` ring '' , if the electron density were constant . the third source ,",
    "37w144 ( rm = @xmath21 ) , has a large positive rm after the foreground rm is subtracted , opposite to that of the continuum `` ring '' .",
    "this source is exactly located behind a dust lane ( walterbos & kennicutt @xcite ) and an hi spiral arm ( brinks & shane @xcite ) .",
    "comparison with the spiral structure of m31 ( braun @xcite ) suggests some strong local perturbation of the magnetic field from the hii regions in this direction , or possibly a field reversal in the dust arm .",
    "two sources appear on the ring , 37w94 ( rm = @xmath22 ) and 37w115 ( rm = @xmath23 ) .",
    "both of them probably are background sources , as indicated by the hi absorption lines ( braun & walterbos @xcite ) .",
    "the former one has an rm deviating from the average twice as much as the continuum emission , though with large error bars , indicating that the field there might be of an even mode as discussed above .",
    "37w115 is the strongest source detected .",
    "this source has soft x - ray emission ( supper et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and its x - ray hardness ( supper et al .",
    "@xcite ) suggests that it is a background source .",
    "however , there seems to be no net rm contribution from m31 so that the rm of this source is equal to the average ( eg . the foreground rm ) .",
    "this could happen if the 3 spiral arms ( braun @xcite ) , through which the line of sight to 37w115 passes , have reversed field directions .",
    "the rm of the extended polarized emission from the `` ring '' is not cancelled because it mainly emerges from one arm ( berkhuijsen et al .",
    "another sources , 37w89 ( rm = @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , not on the ring , is located at a similar @xmath15 , but this source may be a supernova remnant within m31 ( dickey & brinks @xcite ) , which explains the small rm contribution from m31 .    sources exterior to the `` ring '' are interesting as well . compared with the spiral structure given by braun ( @xcite ) , we found that only 37w131 ( rm = @xmath26 ) is far away from the spiral arms , and has an rm equal to the average , which means that the magneto - ionic medium does not extend to @xmath27 kpc in this part of m31 .",
    "however , in the lower part of fig.1 , most sources are in the spiral region outlined by braun ( @xcite ) and their rms are consistent with the rm variation of the `` ring '' .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic field in the disk extends as far as @xmath28kpc in this region , as indicated by 37w168 ( rm = @xmath29 ) and 37w172 ( rm = @xmath30 ) .",
    "furthermore , the toroidal field at this radius has the same direction as that in the `` ring '' , and a significant strength .",
    "the rms of 37w175 ( = @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) suggest that the field with the same structure as in the `` ring '' extends to @xmath33 kpc but with about one half or one third of the field strength in the `` ring '' , assuming constant electron density .",
    "three sources at the upper right corner of fig.1 have about average rms , similar to the rm of continuum `` ring '' at these azimuthal angles . only the farthest one , 37w45 ( rm = @xmath34 ) , has a somewhat negative deviation , which suggests that a weak field extends even to @xmath35 kpc .",
    "this also holds for 37w74 ( rm = @xmath36 ) .    in summary",
    ", our results suggest that ( 1 ) magnetic field exists exterior as well as interior to the `` ring '' ; ( 2 ) the magneto - ionic disk of m31 is extended , probably out to 25 kpc in the plane of the disk ; and ( 3 ) the field in the extended disk generally has a well - ordered structure similar to that in the `` ring '' , but the field strength is smaller than in the `` ring '' , in agreement with the very weak synchrotron emission observed from the extended disk ( berkhuijsen & wielebinski @xcite ) .",
    "the rm data of the continuum `` ring '' near the azimuthal angles of @xmath4 and @xmath6 seem to give some indication for the poloidal magnetic field ( in the halo and disk ) .",
    "as is shown in fig.3 , the rms along lines of sight no.2 and no.4 are expected to have the largest opposite deviations from the mean curve caused by rms originating in the poloidal field which are added to those of the toroidal field .",
    "indeed , two opposite rm bumps , though with large error bars , appear in fig.2 on the rm variation of the `` ring '' near @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which could be caused by the poloidal field ( fig.3 ) .",
    "since the part of m31 at @xmath39 is the near one , we see a smaller bump .",
    "this indicates that the poloidal field of m31 is of even mode as is shown for the s0 dynamo field in fig.3 .",
    "the field is directed inwards near the galactic plane , but is oppositely going outwards when it is far from plane .",
    "if this opposite deviation could be confirmed by more rm data of background sources , then the magnetic field in the halo of m31 is most probably generated by an even mode dynamo , consistent with the ring field in the disk .",
    "the toroidal field in the m31 disk should then be mirror - symmetric with respect to its galactic plane without a vertical field reversal .",
    "no matter what kind of dynamo operates in the halo of m31 , if we attribute the deviating rms of the bumps , @xmath40 rad  m@xmath41 , to the poloidal field , we can estimate an upper limit of the field strength . assuming a thermal electron density of 0.003 @xmath42 and a line of sight of 20 kpc through the thick disk or halo , then this upper limit is about 0.3@xmath43 g , almost the same as the halo field of our galaxy near the sun ( han & qiao 1994 ; han et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our rm observations of background radio sources suggest that the regular magnetic field in the bright `` ring '' of m31 extends from a radius of about 5 kpc interior to the `` ring '' to as far as 25 kpc from the center , probably with similar structure .",
    "we presented evidence that the magnetic field of m31 has the structure of an even mode dynamo field ( s0 ) .",
    "the poloidal field of even symmetry has a strength @xmath44 g .",
