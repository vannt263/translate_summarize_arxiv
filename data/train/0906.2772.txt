    "be stars are non - supergiant b - type stars that exhibit emission in their hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "it has been known for many decades ( e.g. , struve 1931 ) that the `` classical '' be stars tend to rotate more rapidly than normal non - emission b stars .",
    "a wide range of observations of be stars is consistent with the coexistence of a dense circumstellar disk in the equatorial plane and a variable stellar wind at higher latitudes ( doazan 1982 ; slettebak 1988 ; prinja 1989 ; porter & rivinius 2003 ) .",
    "there is a great deal of evidence that the so - called _ decretion disk _ is ejected from the star and is not accreted from an external source of gas .",
    "the physical mechanisms that are responsible for producing the disk , though , are still not known .",
    "this paper investigates the idea that nonradial pulsations ( nrp ) may deposit sufficient angular momentum above the photospheres of rapidly rotating be stars to explain the origins of dense equatorial disks .",
    "theoretical explanations for the be phenomenon depend crucially on how rapidly the stars and disks are rotating . although there is increasing evidence that the extended disks are in keplerian orbit ( e.g. , hanuschik 1996 ; hummel & vrancken 2000 ; okazaki 2007 ) , there is also evidence to show that the underlying photospheres rotate too slowly to propel any atmospheric gas into orbit .",
    "typical observational values of the ratio of equatorial rotation speed to the critical rotation speed @xmath0 ( at which gravity is balanced by the outward centrifugal force ) range between 0.5 and 0.8 ( slettebak 1982 ; porter 1996 ; yudin 2001 ) .",
    "there has been some recent disagreement between this traditional picture and new ideas  inspired by the tendency for _ gravity darkening _ to mask rapid rotation at the equator ",
    "that most or all be stars may be rotating very nearly at @xmath0 ( townsend et al .",
    "cranmer ( 2005 ) found that this may be true for the late - type be stars ( i.e. , spectral types b3 and later ) , but early - type be stars do seem to be consistent with a range of intrinsic rotation speeds between @xmath140% and 100% critical . for stars rotating sufficiently below @xmath0 , any physical model for the origin of be - star disks",
    "requires a significant increase in angular momentum above the photosphere .",
    "this paper develops a set of ideas concerning how stellar nrp may give rise to outwardly propagating circumstellar waves , which in turn can deposit angular momentum in be - star disks .",
    "the history of this theoretical perspective is discussed in more detail in   2 .",
    "however , a number of other disk formation mechanisms have been proposed , and it is important to keep in mind that in some cases these could be acting in cooperation or competition with the pulsational processes advocated here . some of the other suggested mechanisms have been : ( 1 ) stellar `` wind compression '' that may channel supersonically outflowing gas from mid - latitudes to the equatorial plane by conservation of angular momentum ( bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ; bjorkman 2000 ) , ( 2 ) episodic ejections from some point on the star , with some material being propelled forward into orbit and some propelled backward to fall onto the star ( kroll & hanuschik 1997 ; owocki & cranmer 2002 ) , and ( 3 ) magnetic forces that can channel gas toward the equatorial plane and provide sufficient torque to spin up a disk ( e.g. , poe & friend 1986 ; cassinelli et al .   2002 ; brown et al .   2004 , 2008 ; ud - doula et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the three mechanisms listed above have one general feature in common : they depend on the existence of large - scale supersonic flows in the circumstellar regions .",
    "thus , these processes appear likely to give rise to strong variability on short ( dynamical ) time scales .",
    "although many be stars do exhibit variability on time scales of hours to days , many other be stars seem to maintain their disks in a relatively quiescent manner over several years ( see , e.g. , dachs 1987 ; telting 2000 ; okazaki 2007 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile , then , to first consider a `` baseline '' disk formation mechanism that feeds the disk with a more or less steady - state supply of angular momentum from below .",
    "other proposed mechanisms then may act as sources for the complex observed patterns of be - star variability ( see also ",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "  2 presents an overview of how stellar pulsations may be coupled to the outward transport of mass and momentum in the circumstellar regions of be stars . in ",
    "3 the detailed properties of waves and shocks are presented , including how evanescent pulsation modes couple to propagating waves , how these waves steepen into dissipative shocks , and how the waves can exert a net pressure to affect the time - steady properties of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "  4 describes the time - independent conservation equations for mass and momentum that are solved with contributions from the waves , and   5 gives the results .",
    "a discussion of the implications of these models on our overall understanding of be - star disk formation and time variability is given in ",
    "finally ,   7 contains a brief summary of the major results and discusses how the proposed physical processes should be further tested and refined .",
    "do stellar pulsations represent a causal factor in producing the wide variety of observed manifestations of the be phenomenon ?",
    "this possible connection has been discussed for several decades both from the standpoints of be - star observations ( e.g. , baade 1982 , 1985 ; henrichs 1984 ; willson 1986 ; smith 1988 ) and pulsation theory ( ando 1986 ; osaki 1986 ; castor 1986 ; saio 1994 ; lee 2006 , 2007 ) . for a while",
    ", there was significant debate over whether much of the observed be - star line profile variability was even the result of nrp , or if these features were simply rotationally modulated `` spots '' ( e.g. , baade & balona 1994 ) .",
    "however , recent improvements in the detection and modeling of nrp in many be stars has put the pulsational interpretation on firmer footing ( rivinius et al .",
    "2003 ; rivinius 2007 ; townsend 2007 ) .",
    "the well - studied be star @xmath2  cen has been a key target in the search for disk - pulsation correlations ( e.g. , rivinius et al .",
    "the multiple nrp periods of @xmath2  cen seem to undergo beating in phase with outbursts of circumstellar material into the disk , suggesting a direct input of mass and momentum when the pulsation displacements are largest .",
    "increases in disk emission at nrp amplitude maxima have also been observed for other multiperiodic be stars such as @xmath3 oph ( kambe et al .",
    "1993a ) and 28 cyg ( tubbesing et al .",
    "however , similar kinds of outbursts are also seen for be stars like @xmath4  cma that seem to have only a single pulsation period ( tefl et al .",
    "for other be stars , there has been line profile variability observed at doppler velocities that _ exceed the projected photospheric rotation velocity _",
    "( chen et al .   1989 ; kambe et al .",
    "this may be evidence for a radial increase in the rotation rate between the photosphere and the inner edge of the disk .",
    "in addition to observational connections between pulsations and disks , there are many stars without disks ( o , b , and wolf - rayet ) for which there exists coupled variability between the photosphere and the stellar wind .",
    "the radial pulsator bw vul clearly shows nonlinear shock - like features in its photosphere ( e.g. , smith & jeffery 2003 ) that are in phase with radially accelerating features in its supersonic wind ( massa 1994 ; owocki & cranmer 2002 ) .",
    "several stars show different periods for photospheric and wind variability , with the former ( due to nrp ) often being shorter than the latter ( e.g. , howarth et al .",
    "1993 , 1998 ; kaufer et al .",
    "although much of the observed stellar wind variability may be attributed to structures corotating with the star ( kaper et al .",
    "1996 ) , the distribution of these stars in luminosity and effective temperature seems to agree roughly with the domain of so - called `` strange - mode '' oscillations ( fullerton et al .",
    "1996 ) , indicating that there may be a pulsational cause for some types of wind variability .    from a theoretical standpoint",
    ", it has been known for some time that small - scale hydrodynamic fluctuations ( waves , shocks , turbulence , pulsations ) can affect the large - scale mean properties of a fluid .",
    "linear waves propagating in an inhomogeneous medium exert a time - steady _ wave pressure _ on the fluid even without dissipating ( bretherton & garrett 1968 ; dewar 1970 ; jacques 1977 ) .",
    "alfvn wave pressure is believed to be a key contributor to the acceleration of the high - speed solar wind ( e.g. , cranmer 2004 )",
    ". a nonlinear extension of this effect is likely to be acting in the outer atmospheres of cool pulsating giants and supergiants  e.g .",
    ", mira variables and asymptotic giant branch stars  with pulsation driven mass loss suspected to occur in many cases ( willson 2000 ; woitke 2007 ; neilson & lester 2008 ) .",
    "in addition to supplying linear momentum , it has been shown that waves can transport and deposit _ angular momentum _ in rotating systems .",
    "interior gravity waves in rotating planetary atmospheres have been shown to be responsible for driving various kinds of mean shear flows ( eliassen & palm 1960 ; bretherton 1969 ; plumb 1977 ; schatzman 1993 ; rogers et al .",
    "2008 ) . in stellar interiors , the study of how diffusive transport processes",
    "interact with the mean rotation profile has proceeded with the implicit assumption that waves or turbulent eddies may be the cause of the `` anomalous '' transport ( e.g. , rdiger 1977 ; zahn et al .",
    "1997 ; talon 2008 ) .",
    "ando ( 1982 ) considered the coupling between waves and rotation as a possible means of generating differential rotation in stellar interiors .",
    "recently , townsend & macdonald ( 2008 ) found that the interior transport of angular momentum by pulsations may be an important factor in the evolution of rotating massive stars .",
    "the application of the above ideas to the episodic spinup and mass loss of be stars was developed by ando ( 1986 , 1988 ) , osaki ( 1986 , 1999 ) , lee & saio ( 1993 ) , saio ( 1994 ) , and lee ( 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "this mechanism was originally believed to transport angular momentum up to the stellar surface only for prograde nrp modes ( i.e. , modes for which the azimuthal group velocity is in the same direction as the mean rotation ) ; see , e.g. , ando ( 1983 ) .",
    "a retrograde oscillation mode was thought to transport angular momentum downward and thus potentially spin down the outer layers of the star .",
    "however , more recent work  which takes a more complete inventory of the various second order wave - rotation coupling terms  finds that some types of coupling do not depend at all on the sign of the azimuthal group velocity ( e.g. , lee 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , townsend ( 2005 ) and pantillon et al .   ( 2007 ) showed that some `` mixed modes '' may exist in rapidly rotating stars that appear to have retrograde phase velocities but prograde group velocities .",
    "there are thus several potential ways for _ retrograde _ nrp modes ( which appear to be prevalent in be stars ) to be associated with the transport of angular momentum up to the surface and beyond .    aside from the work of ando and colleagues ,",
    "though , surprisingly little work has been done to study how pulsational energy ( as well as the effects of pulsations on the mean fluid ) may `` leak '' out of a hot star into its circumstellar medium .",
    "cranmer ( 1996 ) studied some aspects of how low - frequency evanescent waves in b - star photospheres might evolve into propagating waves at larger heights in a stellar wind .",
    "townsend ( 2000a , b , c ) modeled nrp leakage from the perspective of whether the @xmath5 and @xmath6 modes are propagating or evanescent in the layers directly beneath the photosphere ( see also gautschy 1992 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to follow up on these ideas and to investigate how an extended hot - star atmosphere responds to the presence of pulsational oscillations at its photospheric base .",
    "this section contains a derivation of some of the physical processes that determine how pulsationally driven waves can influence the mean properties of a stellar atmosphere .",
    "the subsections below isolate four of the main effects that need to be considered : evanescence (   3.1 ) , resonant excitation at the acoustic cutoff (   3.2 ) , shock steepening and dissipation (   3.3 ) , and wave pressure (   3.4 ) .",
    "some of the proposed connections between the above mechanisms are still somewhat speculative , so it is hoped that this combination of ideas will eventually be tested with numerical simulations .",
    "this paper makes the implicit assumption that there is a reasonably _ time - steady _ input stream of pulsational oscillations from the stellar interior .",
    "observations suggest , however , that many nrp modes have finite lifetimes , and that they undergo secular amplitude variations over a wide range of time scales ( see   6.2 for discussion of the implications of nrp transience on be - star variability ) .",
    "the models presented below also ignore several effects that may be important in some situations , such as heat conduction , radiative damping , magnetic fields , and ballistic freefall behind strong shocks ( the latter being important in , e.g. , mira variables ) .      for the purposes of modeling the effects of b - star nrp oscillations on their outer atmospheres , it is important to first summarize what is known about them observationally .",
    "the @xmath7  cep variables have typical pulsation periods of order 210 hrs , spectral types between b0 and b2 , and are often interpreted as low - order @xmath5 and @xmath6 modes ( sterken & jerzykiewicz 1992 ; aerts & de cat 2003 ) .",
    "slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars have longer periods of 1050 hrs , later spectral types of b3 to b9 , and they appear to be pulsating in high - order @xmath6 modes ( e.g. , de cat 2007 ) .",
    "pulsating be stars often have periods that appear similar to the spb class , but with some modes ( including beat periods ) that extend up into the 100200 hr range ( e.g. , kaufer et al .",
    "some b stars are `` hybrid '' pulsators that exhibit both @xmath7  cep and spb type modes ( dziembowski & pamyatnykh 2008 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a collection of b - star pulsation frequencies @xmath4 and horizontal wavenumbers @xmath8 that have been normalized , respectively , by dividing by an estimated acoustic cutoff frequency @xmath9 in the photosphere and multiplying by an estimated density scale height @xmath10 .",
    "spectral types , periods , and angular mode identifications were obtained for the @xmath7  cep and spb stars from de cat ( 2002 , 2003)peter / bstars/ ] and for be stars from rivinius et al .",
    "additional low - frequency modes for two hybrid b - type pulsators ( 12  lac and @xmath11  eri ) were taken from dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) , and the assignment of @xmath12 to these modes is relatively uncertain .    the two - dimensional ( @xmath13 ) plot illustrated by figure 1",
    "is often called a diagnostic diagram for waves in stellar atmospheres .",
    "the solid curves are the `` propagation boundary curves '' between which acoustic - gravity waves are evanescent . above the upper curve ,",
    "waves propagate vertically as acoustic or @xmath5-mode waves ; below the lower curve , they propagate as internal gravity or @xmath6-mode waves ( e.g. , lamb 1908 , 1932 ; mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) . to determine the normalizing values of the acoustic cutoff frequency @xmath9 and scale height @xmath10 for each star",
    ", the tabulated spectral types and luminosity classes were converted into stellar masses @xmath14 , radii @xmath15 , and effective temperatures @xmath16 in a single uniform way ; i.e. , using the luminosity and @xmath16 relations of de jager & nieuwenhuijzen ( 1987 ) , and interpolating onto the evolutionary tracks of claret ( 2004 ) to obtain masses ( see also   2 of cranmer 2005 )",
    ". the magnitude of the horizontal wavenumber was computed from the tabulated meridional degree number @xmath17 and the assumption that @xmath18 , the latter being the azimuthal mode number .",

    "the surface gravity was reduced by taking account of both centrifugal and radiative acceleration . a lower limit to the stellar rotation",
    "was applied by assuming that the observed projected rotation rate @xmath21 is equal to the actual equatorial rotation speed @xmath22 . for the be stars , it was assumed that the rotation speed is never smaller than @xmath23 ( see cranmer 2005 ) .",
    "the radiative acceleration in the photosphere was estimated using a fit to the numerical results of lanz & hubeny ( 2007 ) given by equations ( [ eq : gedd])([eq : grad ] ) below .",
    "2 .   for the be stars",
    "only , the observed pulsation frequency was replaced by an estimate of the intrinsic pulsation frequency in the rotating frame , assuming that the be - star oscillations are retrograde ( rivinius et al .",

    "we ignored second order centrifugal terms in the above expression ( i.e. , terms proportional to @xmath28 ) since for low - order @xmath6 modes with @xmath12 they would give a negligibly small correction ( saio 1981 ) .",
    "for the spb stars , these corrections were found to be unimportant and are not shown .",
    "taking account of the above effects results in smaller values of @xmath9 and in larger values of both @xmath4 and @xmath10 , thus moving each data point upwards and to the right in figure 1 .",
    "even with these corrections , though , nearly all of the observed pulsation modes are still solidly evanescent ( i.e. , not propagating vertically ) in the photosphere . also , the be - star data points seem to have moved from the upper edge of the spb region into the @xmath7  cep region .",
    "( many of them seem to cluster around the fundamental - mode curve , given by @xmath29 , which is a rough boundary between the @xmath5-mode and @xmath6-mode regions . )",
    "this may suggest that classical be - star pulsations have a similar intrinsic character as those of the @xmath7  cep variables , despite the apparent similarity of their periods to those of the spb stars ( see also baade 1982 ) .",
    "the observed ranges of oscillation parameters can be put into context by using a theoretical model of _ acoustic - gravity waves . _",
    "the model presented here makes the simplifying assumptions of an isothermal ( constant temperature @xmath30 ) medium , plane - parallel geometry , and a constant gravitational acceleration @xmath6 .",
    "it is also straightforward to first consider the system in the rotating frame , in which we define the frequency @xmath4 . in this atmosphere ,",
    "the sound speed is constant and is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath33 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , and @xmath2 is the mean molecular weight of the gas . the latter quantity is assumed to be @xmath34 , which corresponds to a standard ( 10% helium ) elemental abundance mixture .",
    "the adiabatic exponent @xmath35 is the ratio of specific heats @xmath36 , and usually can range between 1 ( isothermal ) and 5/3 ( adiabatic ) . for an isothermal atmosphere , the pressure and density scale heights are equal to one another and given by @xmath37 ( which does not depend on the value of @xmath35 itself ) .    the standard assumption in linear wave theory is to model the physical variables ( i.e. , density , velocity , pressure ) as the sum of a time - steady ( zeroth order ) component and an oscillating ( first order ) component .",
    "the linear amplitudes vary as @xmath38 with a real frequency @xmath4 .",
    "we model the conditions in the equatorial plane , with gravity acting in the @xmath39 direction and the stellar rotation proceeding in the @xmath40 direction ( see appendix ) .",
    "the azimuthal wavenumber can thus be expressed in conventional nrp terminology as @xmath41 , with negative [ positive ] values of @xmath42 corresponding to prograde [ retrograde ] modes .",

    "the corresponding linear amplitudes are denoted @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , and they are modeled as complex quantities in order to account for phase differences between their respective oscillations .    for a given frequency @xmath4 and horizontal wavenumber @xmath8 ,",

    "the regions of @xmath53 space where the vertical wavenumber has a real part correspond to propagating waves , and the regions where @xmath54 is completely imaginary correspond to evanescence .",

    "this implies that in the case of evanescent waves , @xmath48 and @xmath47 are 90 out of phase , and @xmath49 and @xmath47 are also 90 out of phase .",
    "it is useful to illustrate how these waves behave in the limit of small horizontal wavenumbers ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) which applies to b - star nrp observed at the stellar surface ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is also useful to use the simplifying limit of @xmath58 , which corresponds to isothermal fluctuations .",
    "this approximation is consistent with the existence of rapid radiative heating and cooling in the relatively dense outer atmospheres of hot o and b stars ( e.g. , drew 1989 ; millar & marlborough 1999 ; carciofi & bjorkman 2006 ) . with the above assumptions , the lower propagation boundary disappears and the upper propagation boundary is greatly simplified : i.e. , waves with @xmath59 propagate ; waves with @xmath60 are evanescent .",
    "propagating waves have exponentially growing amplitudes with height , with the non - oscillating part of the height dependence being given by @xmath61 .",
    "these waves have a vertical phase speed @xmath62 and a group velocity @xmath63 . for upwardly propagating waves ,",
    "the above amplitude relations can be simplified to show that @xmath64 @xmath65 note that the sign of @xmath8 determines the sign of the magnitude ratio @xmath66 , but the ratio @xmath67 is positive definite .",
    "evanescent waves have two possible solutions for their ( completely non - oscillatory ) height dependence ; one `` steeper '' than the propagating solution , and one `` shallower . ''",
    "the shallow [ steep ] solution has a total wave energy density that decays [ grows ] with increasing height .",
    "thus , the shallow solution is the physically realistic choice when considering waves that originate at low heights and have effects on the medium at larger heights ( see , e.g. , wang et al .",
    "the vertical amplitude dependence of the shallow solution is given by @xmath68   \\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : w1ev}\\ ] ] for evanescent waves , the phase speed is formally infinite and the group velocity is zero .",
    "cranmer ( 1996 ) showed that if a time - steady _ subsonic wind _",
    "( @xmath69 ) is included in the linear equations for acoustic - gravity waves , the shallow evanescent solution can be shown to have a large  but finite  upward phase speed of order @xmath70 .",
    "the steep evanescent solution corresponds to a downward phase speed of @xmath71 .",
    "these both correspond to negligibly small ( subsonic ) group velocities and do not need to be considered further .",
    "it has been known for some time that the acoustic cutoff @xmath9 is a preferred resonance frequency for an atmosphere that has been disturbed by a pulse or piston - like initial condition ( see , e.g. , lamb 1908 ; schmidt & zirker 1963 ) .",
    "the acoustic cutoff frequency also acts as a fundamental `` ringing '' mode for disturbances of a sinusoidal nature ( fleck & schmitz 1991 ; kalkofen et al .",
    "1994 ; sutmann et al .",
    "1998 ) . of particular interest here is the case of an evanescent oscillation driven by nrp ( with @xmath60 ) that can excite a resonant oscillation ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the one - dimensional problem of resonant excitation in an infinite isothermal atmosphere can be solved analytically ( e.g. , fleck & schmitz 1991 ) . in this section",
    "we make use of this simple model to gain insight about the physics of resonant waves .",
    "although the model contains features that are formally inapplicable to actual pulsating stars ( i.e. , the assumption of an instantaneous `` start '' at @xmath73 ) , it remains valuable as a way to obtain numerical estimates of the resonant wave properties in the absence of a more accurate theory .",
    "let us then consider a piston with an average height slightly below the photosphere ( @xmath74 ) with a vertical pulsation amplitude @xmath75 . for simplicity , the long - wavelength horizontal velocity fluctuations can be ignored ; i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "thus , for a piston oscillating with evanescent frequency @xmath4 , the height dependence of this driven mode is given by equation ( [ eq : w1ev ] ) , and its time dependence at larger heights remains strictly sinusoidal .",
    "in addition , when the piston motion begins ( at time @xmath73 ) there arises a resonant response at the acoustic cutoff frequency .",
    "these two components of the vertical velocity amplitude can be expressed as @xmath77 @xmath78\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( kalkofen et al .   1994 ; sutmann et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the late - time limit of @xmath81 ,",
    "after which the initial transient disturbance has propagated away , the resonant component s velocity amplitude is given by @xmath82 this expression gives only the lowest order term in an infinite expansion ; the higher order terms have more rapid time decay ( e.g. , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , etc . ) and thus the above term dominates the late - time ( @xmath81 ) behavior of the resonant mode .    for a given time @xmath85",
    "after the piston begins to oscillate , both the driven ( evanescent ) mode and the resonant ( cutoff ) mode coexist in the atmosphere . immediately above the piston ,",
    "@xmath86 , but as one proceeds higher in the atmosphere , the radial growth of the resonant mode overtakes that of the shallow evanescent mode ( eq .  [ [ eq : w1ev ] ] ) and the resonant mode becomes stronger . it",
    "is suspected that the stellar photosphere sits _ below _ the height where this transition occurs , because the observable signatures of nrp show only the evanescent driver .",
    "a major conjecture of this paper is that the upper layers of the atmosphere  including the `` inner edge '' of the keplerian disk  are those where the resonant oscillations are dominant .",
    "equation ( [ eq : vfree ] ) shows that the resonant oscillation amplitude decays in time as @xmath87 .",
    "if left undisturbed it would decay eventually to zero , leaving only the driven evanescent mode .",
    "however , this property of the solution seems to be an artifact of the idealized nature of an infinitely extended , isothermal , and plane - parallel atmosphere . for a _ real _ atmosphere ,",
    "there are several effects that have been suggested to arrest this decay and produce a quasi - steady stream of resonant waves :    1 .",
    "fleck & schmitz ( 1991 ) found that a sharp reflecting boundary at some height above the piston ( even a relatively permeable one ) can cause enough downward reflection of the resonant waves to maintain them at a finite amplitude over long times .",
    "reflection effectively `` restarts the clock '' on the time @xmath85 in equation ( [ eq : vfree ] ) every time the piston sees a reflected wave .",
    "2 .   radial gradients in the sound speed or scale height give rise to _ gradual _ linear reflection that can lead to continual excitation of the resonant waves ( e.g. , pitteway & hines 1965 ; schmitz & fleck 1992 ; lou 1995 ; musielak et al .",
    "2005 ; erdlyi et al .   2007 ; taroyan & erdlyi 2008 ) .",
    "this kind of reflection is also believed to be acting on alfvn waves in the solar chromosphere and corona , and in that case it may be responsible for seeding an ongoing turbulent cascade ( heinemann & olbert 1980 ; matthaeus et al .   1999 ; cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ) .",
    "3 .   if the driven evanescent oscillations are multiperiodic or stochastic in nature , the resulting departures from simple sinusoidal piston motion could result in continuously excited resonant waves .",

    "the remainder of this paper assumes the existence of a continual regeneration of resonant oscillations in b - star atmospheres .",
    "the general phenomenon of wave reflection seems to be the most likely route for this to occur .",
    "fleck & schmitz ( 1991 ) showed how the presence of wave reflection may cause the resonant waves to `` forget '' about an instantaneous initial condition and become essentially self - sustaining .",
    "although the reflection in the models of fleck & schmitz ( 1991 ) was induced by a sharp upper boundary , there are several other ways that reflection can be produced gradually in an actual stellar atmosphere ( see the second item in the above list ) . in the absence of a robust theory or simulation of these effects in hot - star atmospheres , however , we are limited to using simpler prescriptions such as equation  ( [ eq : vfree ] ) .",
    "the use of the simple theory derived above should not be interpreted as a suggestion that resonant waves are produced by an abrupt initial condition .",
    "this model is used only to estimate the mean amplitude of a steady - state ensemble of resonant waves , by choosing a representative time @xmath85 in equation ( [ eq : vfree ] ) .",
    "equivalently , this can be specified in terms of the height @xmath88 of a fictional reflecting boundary above the photosphere , and the reflection time is thus estimated as @xmath89 ( see , e.g. , figure 2 of fleck & schmitz 1991 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 is used as a free parameter in the models discussed below .",
    "eventually , of course , there should be time - dependent numerical simulations of the partial wave reflection and resonant wave excitation in b - star atmospheres that would allow the most appropriate values of @xmath88 to be determined .",
    "what values of @xmath88 should be considered realistic ?",
    "it is useful to estimate the heights in the atmosphere at which the fluid parameters are thought to undergo qualitative changes .",
    "these are the heights at which substantial wave reflection should occur .",
    "one suggestion is to compute the height at which the strongest wave modes steepen into shocks ( and probably saturate in amplitude ) .",
    "this onset of nonlinearity signals a rapid change in the overall properties of the atmosphere .",
    "for hot stars with nrp amplitudes that are already of the same order as the sound speed _ in the photosphere , _ the height at which they steepen into shocks may be as low as 2 to 4 photospheric scale heights above the photosphere itself . for a star with an accelerating wind , other significant heights would be the sonic and critical points ( which are not the same for a radiatively driven wind ; see castor et al .",
    "1975 ) . for the standard b2  v star model discussed in detail in   5",
    ", the sonic point would be at a radius of about 10 scale heights .",
    "the critical point is another scale height or two above the sonic point .",
    "it is possible , though , that the relevant time scale @xmath85 could be much larger than suggested above . for a b star",
    ", a value of @xmath90 corresponds to a time that is only about 10% of a single evanescent nrp period .",
    "if @xmath85 is determined instead by long - term secular changes in the nrp `` piston '' ( i.e. , beating or mode growth / decay ) , it may be as large as the mode lifetimes themselves ; typically no smaller than 10 to 100 nrp periods .",
    "however , since there is also evidence for shorter time scales being important ( consistent with ongoing wave reflection from the upper atmosphere ) , we will make the order - of - magnitude assumption that @xmath88 is of order 10 scale heights and vary it up and down from that baseline value .",
    "figure 2 compares the height dependences of vertical velocity amplitudes for evanescent and resonant waves .",
    "the stellar parameters assumed here are those of the baseline b2  v model discussed in detail in   5 .",
    "the evanescent nrp driver has a period of 10 hrs , the acoustic cutoff period is 1.3 hrs , and the piston is assumed to sit @xmath91 below the photosphere . for an assumed value of @xmath92 , the resonant mode becomes stronger than the evanescent mode at a height of approximately 4 scale heights above the photosphere ( i.e. , when the hydrostatic density has dropped by a factor of @xmath150 from the photospheric value ) .",
    "also shown is an upper - limit velocity amplitude @xmath93 that illustrates the total energy density available for waves in a stratified atmosphere .",
    "this quantity was computed under the assumption that @xmath94 is constant , and @xmath93 is normalized by the evanescent nrp driving amplitude at the piston .",
    "the thick curves show linear undamped solutions ( i.e. , eq .",
    "[ [ eq : vfree ] ] ) and the thin curves show the result of applying the shock steepening , dissipation , and wave pressure effects discussed below .    note that the radial growth of the undamped resonant mode is more rapid than for a classical acoustic - gravity wave at @xmath95 ( the latter illustrated by @xmath96 ) .",
    "the extra linear factor of @xmath97 in equation ( [ eq : vfree ] ) is a unique feature of the resonantly excited oscillation .",
    "this factor has the strongest impact very near the piston height , but grows progressively less important once one goes a few scale heights above the piston .",
    "the resulting properties of the upper atmosphere are thus relatively insensitive to the exact value chosen for @xmath98 .",
    "also , when wave damping and wave pressure are taken into account ( i.e. , the thin curves in fig .",
    "2 ) the resonant mode no longer grows faster than @xmath93 at all .    choosing larger values of the reflection height @xmath88 results in a lower `` efficiency '' in the conversion of driving wave energy to resonant wave energy .",
    "this efficiency is estimated as the ratio @xmath99 , and figure 3 shows how this varies as a function of the @xmath88 parameter itself .",
    "the models that were used to compute these efficiencies contained the full range of shock steepening and wave pressure effects ( see  ",
    "3.33.4 ) , and they constrained @xmath100 to never exceed the maximum available energy specified by @xmath93 .",
    "the efficiencies are shown both at the photospheric base and at the height of peak efficiency .",
    "the latter occurs usually a few scale heights above the photosphere , before substantial damping sets in .",
    "it is clear that values of @xmath101 less than about 3 or 4 may not be physically realistic , since they result in the resonant wave attempting to extract more energy from the driving mode than is actually available .    at the subphotospheric height of the idealized piston ,",
    "the models below ignore the effects of radiative acceleration @xmath102 ( which can counteract gravity at and above the photosphere ) .",
    "lanz & hubeny ( 2007 ) reported the existence of a local maximum in @xmath102 at the @xmath103 photosphere , with less of an effect in the deeper layers that have smaller temperature gradients .",
    "thus , because the net gravitational acceleration is higher at the piston than in the photosphere , the acoustic cutoff frequency at the piston is assumed to be slightly higher than that at the photosphere . for the standard b2  v star model , this results in a resonantly excited wave having a frequency about 1.2 times the _ local _ acoustic cutoff frequency once it reaches the photosphere . in other words ,",
    "the assumption is that the wave eventually `` forgets '' about its origin as a resonant excitation and just propagates ( as any other linear wave would ) with a constant frequency .",
    "the resonantly excited wave modes discussed above ( @xmath104 ) are assumed to propagate upward from the photosphere and grow in amplitude . at some point , these mainly longitudinal fluctuations are expected to steepen into shocks and begin to dissipate some of their energy ( e.g. , castor 1986 ) .",

    "how believable are the models presented above ? this is a nontrivial question to ask when attempting to solve a problem that has plagued a discipline for three quarters of a century .",
    "the chain of events described in this paper remains somewhat speculative mainly because of the need to assume a finite reflection time ( or reflection height @xmath88 ) that provides a time - steady yield of resonantly excited waves . if the resonant waves are much weaker than those predicted with @xmath265 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , then this pulsational mechanism may not work .",
    "additionally , if the frequency of resonant oscillations varies with height to stay equal to the _ local _ acoustic cutoff frequency ( rather than remain at the piston s cutoff frequency ) , then the waves may not propagate upward . in that case , the phase shift factors @xmath266 and @xmath267 ( eq .  [ [ eq : phis ] ] ) could be much smaller than if the waves were propagating , and the ability to transport angular momentum would be reduced .",
    "it is important to note , though , that there were several places in the above analysis where the wave coupling effects were decidedly _ underestimated .",

    "third , the eulerian mass conservation equation ( eq .  [ [ eq : mcons ] ] ) was solved for @xmath43 instead of the lagrangian version , resulting in a potentially weaker impact on the angular momentum transport .",
    "fourth , this analysis totally neglected the fact that even purely evanescent waves can propagate energy in the horizontal direction ( walterscheid & hecht 2003 ) , and thus they may be able to exert a substantial wave pressure force in the azimuthal direction  even if they do not convert any of their energy into the resonant mode .",
    "this paper made the implicit assumption that many early - type be stars are rotating significantly below the critical limit , as suggested by , e.g. , slettebak ( 1982 ) , mennickent et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , porter ( 1996 ) , and cranmer ( 2005 ) .",
    "if instead _ all _ be stars are rotating close to critically ( i.e. , @xmath268 ) as suggested by maeder & meynet ( 2000 ) and townsend et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the formation of disks could be accomplished with much more inefficient  and less speculative  physical mechanisms ( see also owocki 2005 ) . in any case , for be stars undergoing nrp with amplitudes of order the sound speed in their photospheres , many of the processes described in this paper should be occurring nevertheless .",
    "the most prominent feature of be stars that has not yet been addressed here is their substantial variability .",
    "most noticeably , be stars are known to exhibit phase changes between normal b ( i.e. , `` bn '' ) , standard be , and be - shell properties ( e.g. , slettebak 1988 ; kogure 1990 ) .",
    "these changes are typically interpreted as variations in the density and geometry of the circumstellar disk , though long - term changes in the properties of the photosphere have also been inferred ( doazan et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "although it was suggested earlier (   1 ) that a collection of other proposed mechanisms for producing be - star disks may be responsible for some of the observed variability , it is worthwhile to also examine whether nrp / wave coupling would also contribute . in the models presented in this paper ,",
    "the support of be - star disks is provided ultimately by the kinetic and thermal energy in nrp motions .",
    "thus , variations in the overall properties of the disk could be caused by variations of the stellar pulsations on the same kinds of time scales ( i.e. , long - term changes in the nrp `` piston '' ) .",
    "in fact , rapid stellar rotation has been shown to be connected with several kinds of pulsational variability and stochasticity :    1 .",
    "the rotational splitting of nrp modes gives rise to closely separated periods that may be responsible for _ beating _ and amplitude modulations on time scales of weeks to months .",
    "for example , rivinius et al .   (",
    "1998 ) found a set of periods for @xmath2  cen that are separated by fractional frequency differences of order 0.010.02 , such that the beating maxima and minima can occur with periods up to several years .",
    "there is also long - term _ drift _ in the precise values of many observed frequencies that could indicate beating or other kinds of multi - mode interactions ( e.g. , tefl & balona 1996 ; sareyan et al .",
    "it has also been suggested ( henrichs 1984 ) that rotational splitting  especially for rapid rotation ",
    "may create additional `` channels '' of energy transfer between nrp and the mean state , and may even allow more pulsational energy to escape from the star .",
    "as nrp modes grow to large amplitudes ( i.e. , @xmath269 ) a host of nonlinear wave - wave interactions become possible that are not present in the linear , small - amplitude limit .",
    "there is observational evidence for a given nrp mode to grow slowly in amplitude , seemingly at the expense of another mode ( smith 1986 ) .",
    "as a pulsation mode becomes nonlinear , it may even lose sinusoidal coherence by `` interfering with itself '' as it circumnavigates the star in longitude ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "if this occurs it could lead to shock steepening and dissipation in @xmath147 , instead of in @xmath117 as assumed in ",
    "the passage of an azimuthally propagating shock past a given point on the star could also act as a nonlinear trigger to restart the wave reflection `` clock '' for resonant excitation .",
    "osaki ( 1999 ) suggested that a combination of these effects  along with feedback from the dense circumstellar envelope  would also lead to the eventual quenching of angular momentum transport , and thus to the dissipation of the disk .",
    "such a repeated relaxation - oscillation cycle could be responsible for the phase variations between no disks ( bn ) , standard disks ( be ) , and optically thick disks ( be - shell ) .",
    "3 .   the existence of _ subsurface convection _",
    "could both impact the long - term growth or decay of pulsation modes and act as a seed for circumstellar variability ( e.g. , cox 1980 ; balmforth 1992 ; gabriel 1998 ; cantiello et al .",
    "traditionally , b - type stars are not believed to have subsurface convection zones .",
    "there is some indirect evidence , however , that strong turbulent motions may be present near the surfaces of rapidly rotating early - type stars ( smith 1970 ; kodaira 1980 ; dolginov & urpin 1983 )",
    ". some recent models of oblate rapid rotators do show the emergence of a near - surface convection cell at the equator ( espinosa lara & rieutord 2007 ; maeder et al .",
    "2008 ) . even nonrotating hot stars  sufficiently above the main sequence  may exhibit enhanced subsurface convection due to newly discovered opacity peaks ( cantiello et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "although strictly unrelated to the stellar pulsations , another major source of long - term be - star variability appears to be the naturally slow _",
    "precession _ of non - axisymmetric density fluctuations through the dense keplerian disk ( e.g. , papaloizou et al .   1992 ; savonije & heemskerk 1993 ; fit & harmanec 2006 ) . gas parcels rotating under the influence of a non - point - mass",
    "gravitational potential undergo elliptical orbits with slow ( decade timescale ) pattern speeds .",
    "the modes that grow the fastest seem to be @xmath270 , or `` one - armed , '' instabilities that appear to match the observed properties of the evolving violet - to - red ( @xmath271/@xmath272 ) ratio of double - peaked balmer emission line profiles . the ability to produce accurate and predictive models of these variations depends on understanding the origin and supply of angular momentum at the inner boundaries of the disks .",
    "finally , magnetic fields should not be neglected as an additional source of variability .",
    "recent observational studies are beginning to reveal a distinct subclass of magnetic be stars , which includes @xmath35  cas and at least a half - dozen others around spectral types",
    "b0e  b1e ( smith et al .   2004 ;",
    "smith & balona 2006 ; rakowski et al .",
    "2006 ; lopes de oliveira et al .",
    "magnetic interactions between the star and the disk could be the source of dynamo action ; i.e. , another potential source of year- to decade - long variations in the circumstellar emission .",
    "note that these processes may be acting whether or not the stellar wind is channeled along magnetic flux tubes to feed gas into the disk ( e.g. , cassinelli et al .   2002 ; brown et al .   2004 , 2008 ;",
    "ud - doula et al .   2008 ) .",
    "the primary aim of this paper has been to explore and test a set of physical processes that may be responsible for the production of keplerian decretion disks around classical be stars .",
    "although nonradial pulsations correspond to low - frequency evanescent waves in the photospheres of hot stars , they have been suggested to give rise to higher frequency resonant oscillations at the acoustic cutoff frequency .",
    "if these resonant modes grow in amplitude with increasing height , begin to propagate upwards , and steepen into shocks , the resulting dissipation would create substantial wave pressure that both increases the atmospheric scale height and transports angular momentum upwards . using a reasonable assumption for the efficiency of resonant wave generation ,",
    "this chain of events was found to be able to create the inner boundary conditions required for a dense keplerian disk , even when the underlying photosphere is rotating as slowly as @xmath160% of its critical rotation speed .",
    "it is important to note that in the models presented above , the `` spinup '' of the atmosphere occurs high enough _ above _ the photosphere so that standard measurements of the stellar rotation speed ( i.e. , @xmath21 from absorption line widths ) would not be sensitive to these motions .",
    "the density at which the spinup is complete occurs several orders of magnitude below the photospheric ( @xmath103 ) density , and these values are consistent with inner - edge disk densities as measured by infrared excess and linear polarization techniques ( see   5.2 )",
    ". one way of potentially verifying that spinup is occurring in this thin layer would be to improve on measurements of spectral lines that are formed at a range of heights above the photosphere ( see , e.g. , chen et al .",
    "in addition , the proposed scenario for resonant wave excitation implies that the dominant frequency of variability should shift from low ( evanescent piston ) to high ( acoustic cutoff ) values as the height increases .    in order to further test and verify that nrp - induced wave pressure is responsible for spinning up be - star disk material",
    ", the physics of the resonant excitation process needs to be simulated more accurately . it may be possible to begin with one - dimensional simulations ( similar to those of fleck & schmitz 1991 ) to explore both the time - steady yield of energy conversion from evanescent to resonant waves and the gradual increase in scale height due to radial wave pressure",
    "also , an analytic non - wkb treatment of partial wave reflection may shed light on how much intrinsic `` leakage '' the evanescent waves may undergo , even in the absence of resonant conversion ( see heinemann & olbert 1980 ; cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ; cranmer 2008 ) .    testing",
    "the _ full _ set of processes ( e.g. , resonant excitation , wave pressure , and angular momentum transfer ) appears to require at least two - dimensional simulations of the fluid properties in the equatorial plane of a rotating hot star .",
    "these may take the form of next - generation extensions of studies by kroll & hanuschik ( 1997 ) and owocki & cranmer ( 2002 ) , who showed that a large - amplitude nrp - like lower boundary could give rise to intermittent angular momentum transfer .",
    "simulations may also benefit from an improved treatment of viscosity , which would be needed to extend the models upward to larger distances in the disk midplane ( see , e.g. , lee et al .",
    "1991 ; okazaki 2001 ) .",
    "it is likely that once simulations reveal the key physical processes , semi - analytic models like those presented in this paper can be improved to be more robust , predictively accurate , and less dependent on free parameters .    for the stellar models in which a supersonic wind begins to accelerate , a more physically realistic treatment of the radiative acceleration is needed . for example ,",
    "the artificial imposition of a specific value for @xmath182 should be replaced with a self - consistent calculation of the disk s mass loss rate , which may be completely uncoupled from that of the polar wind .",
    "the proper modeling of b - type stellar outflows may also require an explicit treatment of collisional coupling between the various atomic and ionic species ( babel 1995 ; krtika & kubt 2001 ; owocki & puls 2002 ; votruba et al .   2007 ) and a consistent solution for the internal energy equation , including both shock heating ( e.g. , struck et al .   2004 ) and radiative scattering effects ( gayley & owocki 1994 ) .",
    "lastly , it should be emphasized that future work must involve not only increased physical realism for the models , but also quantitative comparisons with observations .",
    "it would be beneficial to apply the methodology outlined in this paper to a set of well - observed stars , rather than to the idealized spectral - type sequence illustrated in figure 8 .",
    "measured stellar properties  including the dominant nrp velocity amplitudes  would be used as input constraints for models similar to those described in this paper .",
    "these models could then produce specific predictions for whether there should ( or should not ) be an equatorial disk for each star",
    ". other models of the be phenomenon , such as those summarized in   1 , will likely result in a different division of predicted disks versus non - disks for the same database of stars .",
    "comparisons of each set of predictions with the observed occurrence of disks would act as a clear test of the viability of the proposed physical processes .",

    "this geometry is applied to the equatorial plane of a rotating system , where @xmath273 points radially outward and @xmath148 points in the prograde azimuthal direction ( i.e. , increasing @xmath148 means increasing @xmath147 in the direction of rotational motion ) .",
    "we assume symmetry above and below the equatorial plane , so that all variations in colatitude @xmath274 ( or cartesian coordinate @xmath275 ) are ignored .",
    "the two nontrivial velocity components are defined as @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "the equations of mass and momentum conservation are written as @xmath278 @xmath279 @xmath280 it is important to write the above equations in their full `` conservation form . ''",
    "let us assume that all dynamical variables can be split into the sum of zeroth order ( time steady ) and first order ( sinusoidally oscillating ) components .",
    "initially , the radial wind velocity @xmath281 and the mean rotation velocity @xmath282 are assumed to have arbitrary dependences on height .",
    "the mean density scale height is defined as @xmath283 .",
    "all zeroth order properties are assumed to be constant in both time @xmath85 and horizontal position @xmath148 .    retaining only the zeroth order terms yields equations for the mean atmospheric stratification in the absence of wave pressure .",
    "collecting the first order terms yields the dispersion relation as well as relative amplitude relations for linear waves .",
    "these are discussed by , e.g. , mihalas & mihalas ( 1984 ) and wang et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and the first - order expressions themselves are given in equations ( 7.82)(7.90 ) of cranmer ( 1996 ) .",
    "the remainder of this appendix deals with the second order terms ; i.e. , those that involve products of two first order fluid quantities . if the time average of a given second order term ( taken over either a single wave period of an integer multiple of periods ) does not vanish , then it gives rise to a net contribution to the time - steady conservation equations .",
    "for example , the period - averaged mass flux conservation equation can be written as @xmath284 the period - averaging is denoted by angle brackets .",
    "these terms can be simplified further by exploring some of the mathematical properties of such time averages .",
    "consider a complex first order quantity @xmath285 , where the real amplitudes @xmath286 and @xmath287 are assumed to contain an unspecified dependence on @xmath273 .",
    "for two such quantities ( @xmath27 and @xmath6 ) , the eulerian average of their product over a period @xmath288 has the following real part : @xmath289 where @xmath290 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath27 and this averaged quantity is constant in @xmath85 and @xmath148 . an additional and useful identity can be derived for these kinds of sinusoidal time variations , @xmath291 and a similar identity can be defined by replacing @xmath85 with @xmath148 , since the @xmath148 variations are ideally sinusoidal as well .",
    "( this can not be done for the variations in @xmath273 , however . )",
    "thus , the second term in equation ( [ eq : mass02 ] ) is zero , and the radial derivative in the third term can be taken outside the angle brackets to obtain @xmath292 this is the lagrangian form of the mass conservation equation , which indicates that longitudinal and compressive waves can be responsible for a nonzero mass flux even in the absence of a mean local ( eulerian ) flow velocity @xmath43 .",
    "the ramifications of the @xmath164 term ( also sometimes called the `` stokes drift '' ) are discussed in   4 .",
    "the sum of the second order terms in the @xmath148 and @xmath273 components of the momentum conservation equation form a vector that we define as @xmath293 .",
    "dimensionally , @xmath294 has the units of a pressure gradient , or force per unit volume , and its components are @xmath295 @xmath296 these expressions can be simplified by noticing that the derivatives with respect to @xmath85 and @xmath148 can be neglected when constructing the period averages of @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "thus , the mean azimuthal wave pressure gradient is given by @xmath299 the first and second terms in equation ( [ eq : sxpent ] ) are referred to by lee & saio ( 1993 ) and lee ( 2007 ) as occurring on transport time scales @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively .",
    "the third term depends on the eulerian mean velocity @xmath43 and is traditionally ignored in stellar interiors models ( for which the only mean motions are meridional circulations with speeds many orders of magnitude smaller than the pulsation amplitudes ) .",
    "we also neglect the @xmath43 term here ( see below ) , and the remaining terms can be written as @xmath300 because the first term above depends on @xmath48 , its overall sign thus depends on the sign of @xmath8 ( see eq .  [ [ eq : u1w1simp ] ] ) .",
    "the second term , though , has the same sign no matter whether the waves are prograde or retrograde . for this term ,",
    "it is straightforward to see that when @xmath49 and @xmath47 are in phase with one another ( e.g. , for an upwardly propagating wave ) and @xmath44 is positive ( i.e. , for bulk rotation in the @xmath40 direction ) , it behaves similarly to the radial wave pressure . in other words , if the pressure - like quantity being differentiated with respect to @xmath273 decreases as one goes up in height , it will result in a positive force ( i.e. , an upward acceleration for @xmath298 and an acceleration in the prograde direction for @xmath297 ) .",
    "the vertical ( radial ) wave pressure gradient can be condensed down to only two terms , with @xmath301 as above , the term depending explicitly on @xmath43 will be neglected here . thus , the single remaining term @xmath302 is equivalent to the plane - parallel limit of the wave pressure gradient derived elsewhere ( e.g. , jacques 1977 ; koninx 1992 ) in the limit of @xmath58 ( isothermal fluctuations ) .",
    "also , the above expression is equivalent to equation ( [ eq : gwpr0 ] ) as long as the waves are sinusoidal in shape ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the above form of the radial wave pressure ( eq .  [ [ eq : szfin ] ] ) is the same as that derived by jacques ( 1977 ) and others , despite the fact that they do _ not _ make the assumption that @xmath303 .",
    "in fact , they apply equation ( [ eq : szfin ] ) directly to the problem of how waves can help accelerate _ supersonic winds . _",
    "thus , it is likely that taking the limit of @xmath304 in the above equations is equivalent to transforming into the local comoving frame of reference of the fluid .",
    "be set to zero in a similar manner as @xmath43 was set to zero . for a rotating system ,",
    "the terms that depend on @xmath44 are likely to depend on the centrifugal or coriolis forces , which can not be removed by a simple coordinate transformation . ]",
    "the proper reynolds stresses in @xmath297 and @xmath298 are those that add momentum to the fluid in the comoving ( lagrangian ) frame .",

    "<S> classical be stars are an enigmatic subclass of rapidly rotating hot stars characterized by dense equatorial disks of gas that have been inferred to orbit with keplerian velocities . </S>",
    "<S> although these disks seem to be ejected from the star and not accreted , there is substantial observational evidence to show that the stars rotate more slowly than required for centrifugally driven mass loss . </S>",

    "<S> the pulsations themselves are evanescent in the stellar photosphere , but they may be unstable to the generation of resonant oscillations at the acoustic cutoff frequency . a detailed theory of the conversion from pulsations to resonant waves does not yet exist for realistic hot - star atmospheres , so the current models depend on a parameterized approximation for the efficiency of wave excitation . once resonant waves have been formed , however , they grow in amplitude with increasing height , steepen into shocks , and exert radial and azimuthal reynolds stresses on the mean fluid . using reasonable assumptions for the stellar parameters , </S>",
    "<S> these processes were found to naturally create the inner boundary conditions required for dense keplerian disks , even when the underlying b - star photosphere is rotating as slowly as 60% of its critical rotation speed . </S>",
    "<S> because there is evidence for long - term changes in be - star pulsational properties , this model may also account for the long - term variability of be stars , including transitions between normal , be , and shell phases . </S>"
