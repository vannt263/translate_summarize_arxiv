    "mode - coupling theory for ideal glass - transitions ( mct ) describes the transition from a liquid to a glass as a bifurcation in the equation for the long - time limit of the density - autocorrelation function @xmath2 for density fluctuations of wave - number modulus @xmath3 .",
    "if the long - time limit @xmath4 reaches zero , @xmath5 , the system is in the liquid state . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the system is in a glass state @xcite .",
    "the theory has been worked out in detail for the hard - sphere system ( hss ) @xcite where the results of experiments @xcite and computer simulations @xcite support the validity of mct .",
    "in addition to liquid - glass transitions , mct also allows for bifurcations of higher order @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that only bifurcations of a certain hierarchy @xmath7 can arise from mct @xcite which are equivalent to the singularities in the real roots of polynomials of order @xmath8 upon variation of parameters @xcite .",
    "the simplest singularity @xmath9 or _ fold _ generically occurs when only a single control parameter is changed and the liquid - glass transition is identified with this bifurcation . at the critical value of the control",
    "parameter the long - time limit @xmath10 jumps from zero to @xmath11 .",
    "close to the singularity and for small @xmath12 , the correlation functions can be expanded in asymptotic series yielding power laws .",
    "a detailed analysis including leading and next - to - leading order results was given for the hss @xcite .",
    "an @xmath13-singularity or _ cusp _ can appear when two control parameters are varied .",
    "the @xmath13-singularity is the endpoint of a line of @xmath9-singularities which are identified as glass - glass - transition points where a first glass state , characterized by @xmath14 , transforms discontinuously into a second glass state with @xmath15 . at the @xmath13 , this discontinuity vanishes and the glass - glass - transition line ends .",
    "such cusp was predicted for particles interacting with a hard core and a short - ranged attraction @xcite where density and strength of the attraction are the control parameters .",
    "the glass - glass transition takes place between a state dominated by repulsion as in the hss and a state dominated by attraction , the latter arrested state was proposed to be related to a gel @xcite .",
    "tuning a third control - parameter , the extension of the glass - glass - transition line can be varied and once the latter vanishes , the @xmath13-singularity merges with the liquid - glass - transition line and gives birth to a _ swallowtail _ or @xmath16-singularity . if the range of the attraction is of the order of 5% of the hard - core diameter such singularity is predicted for a square - well system with a strength of the attraction of several @xmath17 and a density which is slightly larger than the one for the glassy arrest in the hss @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the power - laws at the @xmath9-singularity , the dynamics close to higher - order singularities is ruled by the logarithm of the time @xcite .",
    "the wave - vector dependent asymptotic solutions along with the corrections have been calculated in full generality @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic laws were demonstrated for the @xmath13-singularity of a two - component model @xcite , and for the higher - order singularities of microscopic models with short - ranged attraction @xcite .",
