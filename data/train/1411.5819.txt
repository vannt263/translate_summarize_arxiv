    "to find the maximal volume polyhedra in @xmath0 with a given number of vertices and inscribed in the unit sphere , was first mentioned in @xcite in 1964 .",
    "a systematic investigation of this question was started with the paper @xcite of berman and hanes in 1970 , who found a necessary condition for optimal polyhedra , and determined those with @xmath1 vertices .",
    "the same problem was examined in @xcite , where the author presented the results of a computer - aided search for optimal polyhedra with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "nevertheless , according to our knowledge , this question , which is listed in both research problem books @xcite and @xcite , is still open for polyhedra with @xmath3 vertices apart from the fortunate case of @xmath4 when the solution is the regular icosahedron . in @xcite",
    "the authors investigated this problem for polytopes in arbitrary dimensions . by generalizing",
    "the methods of @xcite , presented a necessary condition for the optimality of a polytope .",
    "the author found the maximum volume polytopes in @xmath5 , inscribed in the unit sphere @xmath6 , with @xmath7 vertices .",
    "for @xmath8 vertices , found the maximum for @xmath9 odd , over the family of all polytopes , and for @xmath9 even , over the family of not cyclic polytopes .",
    "one of the most important tools of @xmath10-dimensional investigations is the result of l. fejes - tth on the volume bounds of the polyhedra inscribed in the unit sphere ( formula ( 2 ) on p. 263 in @xcite ) . for triangular polyhedra",
    "it can be simplified into another one ( see p.264 in @xcite ) which we call _ icosahedron inequality_. the calling motivated by the fact , that this inequality implies the case of @xmath4 points when the unique solution is the icosahedron .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give similar inequalities for such cases when it need to take into consideration certain ( other than the number of vertices ) prescribed information on the examined class of polytopes inscribed in the unit sphere . in section 3",
    "we generalize the icosahedron inequality for such triangular bodies which faces has given the lengths of the maximal edges , respectively ( prop .",
    "3 , theorem 1 ) .",
    "our extracted formula is valid not only for convex polyhedra but star - shaped with respect to origin polyhedra , too .",
    "( theorem 1 ) . as a further consequence of the generalized inequality",
    "we prove the conjecture which states that the maximal volume polyhedron spanned by the vertices of two regular simplices with common centroid is the cube .",
    "this conjecture was raised and proved partially in @xcite and inspired some other examinations on the volume of the convex hull of simplices @xcite .",
    "in section 4 we consider the general ( non - triangular ) case and prove some inequalities on it , too .",
    "finally , we give the source file ( written by mathematica 10 ) of the symbolic and numerous calculations of the proof of theorem 1 in the last section .",
    "since we use some of the important steps of the proof of these inequalities we collect them in a separate proposition .",
    "let @xmath11 be the area of a convex @xmath12-gon @xmath13 lying in the unit sphere , @xmath14 the ( spherical ) area of the central projection of @xmath13 upon the unit sphere , and @xmath15 the volume of the pyramid of base @xmath13 and apex @xmath16 which is the centre of the unit sphere .",
    "let denote @xmath17 the maximum of @xmath15 for a given pair of values @xmath12 and @xmath14 .    with the above notation we have the following statements on @xmath17 .    1 .   for given values of @xmath12 and @xmath18 the volume @xmath19 attains its maximum @xmath20 if @xmath21 is a regular @xmath12-gon",
    "2 .   for general @xmath22",

    "if @xmath26 denotes the volume , @xmath27 the circumradius of a convex polyhedron having @xmath28 faces , @xmath19 vertices and @xmath29 edges , then @xmath30 equality holds only for regular polyhedra .",
    "a polyhedron with a given number @xmath31 of vertices is always the limiting figure of a triangular polyhedron with @xmath31 vertices , hence , introducing the notation @xmath32 we have the following inequality @xmath33 equality holds in ( 2.4 ) only for the regular tetrahedron , octahedron and icosahedron ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "our first proposition is a rewriting of ( 1 ) of proposition 1 in a more general form when @xmath35 . if @xmath36 are three points on the unit sphere we can say two triangles with these vertices , one of the corresponding spherical triangle and the second one the rectilineal triangle with these vertices , respectively .",
    "both of them are denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the angles of the rectilineal triangle are the half of the angles between those radius of the circumscribed circle which connect the center @xmath38 of the rectilineal triangle @xmath37 to the vertices @xmath36 . since @xmath38 is also the foot of the altitude of the tetrahedron with base @xmath37 and apex @xmath16 , hence the angles @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the rectilineal triangle @xmath37 , play an important role in our investigations , we refer to them as the _ central angle _ of the spherical edges @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "then there is an isosceles triangle @xmath46 inscribed into the unit sphere with the following properties :    * the greatest central angles and also the spherical areas of the two triangles are equal to each other , respectively ; * the volume of the facial tetrahedron with base @xmath46 is greater than or equal to the volume of the facial tetrahedron with base @xmath37 .",
    "assume first that the triangle @xmath37 contains the centre @xmath38 of its circumscribed circle .",

    "the angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 the spherical angles of the triangle @xmath50 at @xmath47 and @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) , respectively .",
    "then the area of the triangle @xmath53 is equal to @xmath54 on the domain @xmath55 it is a concave function of two variables ( see p.267 in @xcite ) .",
    "hence @xmath56 @xmath57 where the value on the right hand side of the inequality above is the area of the isosceles triangle @xmath46 .",
    "( we note that the central projections upon the sphere of the two triangles have the same spherical excess @xmath58 . )",
    "compare now the altitudes @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the pyramids based on the two triangles , respectively .",
    "the spherical area of the first triangle is @xmath61",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 by the convexity ( see e.g. p. 229 in @xcite ) of @xmath65 we get that @xmath66 on the other hand by @xmath60 we have @xmath67 implying that @xmath68 @xmath69 from which follows that @xmath70 .",
    "second assume that the angle at @xmath52 is obtuse",
    ". then @xmath71 and we have @xmath72 on the other hand @xmath73 and the volume in question is @xmath74 we consider the maximum of @xmath75 under the conditions @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 with respect to the unknown values @xmath79 and @xmath59 . using lagrange s method we get two equations @xmath80 @xmath81 which are equivalent to the equations @xmath82 @xmath83 because of the equality @xmath84 these conditions turn out to be equivalent to @xmath85 which can not be satisfied unless @xmath86 .",
    "hence if the triangle is not an isosceles one it is not a local extremum of our problem , on the other hand by compactness it has at least one local maximum proving our statement .",
    "we can compare the formulas of proposition 2 @xmath87 and @xmath88 on @xmath41 and @xmath89 . in both cases we assumed that @xmath41 and @xmath90 are in the interval",

    "this shows that an optimal triangle with the fixed edge length @xmath102 ( which corresponding to a facial tetrahedron with maximal volume ) is an isosceles one .",

    "in fact , for fixed @xmath18 the least value of the maximal edge length attend at the case of regular triangle .",
    "if @xmath169 then we have @xmath170 and if @xmath171 then @xmath172 proving our statement .    observe that the function @xmath173 is concave in the parameter domain @xmath174 with certain concave ( in @xmath18 ) function @xmath175 defined by the zeros of the hessian ; and non - concave in the domain @xmath176 , where @xmath177 .",

    "then we have @xmath189    the volume of @xmath13 is bounded above by the quantity @xmath190 using the concavity of the function @xmath173 on the domain @xmath191 and the fact that the function @xmath192 for fixed @xmath18 is monotone decreasing by @xmath151 on the domain @xmath193 , we get the following upper bound for @xmath15 : @xmath194 since for @xmath195 the points @xmath196 are in the convex domain @xmath197 then the point @xmath198 also in @xmath191 .",
    "applying again the concavity property of the function @xmath173 , we get the inequality @xmath199 @xmath200 as we stated .    when @xmath201 we have the following formula : @xmath202 where @xmath203 . in this case",
    "the upper bound is sharp if all face - triangles are obtuse isosceles ones with the same area and maximal edge lengths .",
    "the condition of sharpness implies that the unit sphere tiling by the congruent copies of such isosceles spherical triangles which equal sides are less than or equal to the third one .",
    "observe that a polyhedron corresponding to such a tiling could not be convex .",
    "this motivates the following problem : _ give such values @xmath18 and @xmath151 that the isosceles spherical triangle with area @xmath123 and unique maximal edge length @xmath151 can be generate a tiling of the unit sphere .",
    "_ we note that the regular bodies with triangular faces hold the above property .",
    "we get a non - trivial example for this question , if we consider a rhombic dodecahedron with the same centroid as of the center of the sphere and we project from the center its vertices to the sphere ( see the left figure in fig.2 ) .",
    "( note that there is no circumscribed sphere about a rhombic dodecahedron hence the projection is necessary . )",
    "we get a tiling of the sphere containing congruent spherical quadrangles .",
    "one of these quadrangles has four congruent sides and two diagonals , respectively .",
    "the length of the longer diagonal is @xmath171 .",
    "( on left ) , the original rhombic dodecahedron and the convex convex hull @xmath204 of @xmath13 ( on right ) . ]    we can dissect these quadrangles at this longer diagonals into two congruent spherical triangles . denote by @xmath205 the polyhedron defined by those plane triangles as facets which corresponds to these spherical triangles , respectively .",
    "the angles and sides have the respective measures @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "hence the area of this triangle @xmath208 as follows from the fact , that the @xmath209 congruent copies of it , tile the whole sphere .",
    "observe that @xmath205 is not convex since the distance of the opposite vertices of two triangles with common base ( in euclidean measure ) ( @xmath210 ) is less than that of the euclidean length of the common base ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "since we have only one type of triangles for which @xmath212 we can apply ( 3.9 ) with @xmath213 , @xmath214 , hence @xmath215 this quantity is an upper bound for the volume of such star - shaped polyhedra which inscribed into the unit sphere , have 24 faces with spherical area @xmath163 with the assumption @xmath216 and with maximal edge length @xmath217 .",
    "we get such polyhedra if we change a little - bit the position of those vertices of @xmath13 which denoted by white circles on fig.2 .",
    "( for @xmath18 ( by mathematica 10 see in the last section at in[20 ] ) we get the assumption @xmath218 . )",
    "denote by @xmath204 the convex hull of @xmath13 ( see the right figure on fig.2 ) .",
    "then @xmath219 and we can apply again ( 3.9 ) . hence we get that @xmath220 @xmath204 has maximal volume of the class of such polyhedra which can be gotten from @xmath204 by a little change of the position of the vertices denoted by black circles , respectively .",
    "assume that @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "then the upper bound is @xmath223 which is the volume of the cube inscribed into the unit sphere .",
    "hence we got a new proof for that case of theorem 3.3 of @xcite when we restrict our examination to those triangulations in which there is no face - triangle having edge length greater than the edge length of a regular tetrahedron inscribed into the unit sphere .",
    "we now apply our inequality ( 3.7 ) to prove the general form of theorem 3.3 in @xcite in which the additional assumption `` the tetrahedra are in dual position '' has been omitted .",
    "consider two regular tetrahedron inscribed into the unit sphere .",
    "the maximal volume of the convex hull @xmath13 of the eight vertices is the volume of the cube @xmath52 inscribed into to unit sphere , so @xmath224    we have to consider only that case which is not was considered in @xcite .",
    "hence we assume that in the spherical regular triangles of the spherical tiling corresponding to the first regular tetrahedron there are @xmath225 vertices of the second tetrahedron , respectively . the five points ( the three vertices of the first spherical triangle and the two vertices of the second tetrahedron having in this triangle ) having in the first closed spherical triangle form a triangular dissection of it into five other spherical triangle .",
    "unfortunately , this dissection contains also such triangles which maximal edge lengths greater than that of the edge length of the regular spherical triangle contains them . on the other hand these triangles",
    "belongs to the parameter domain @xmath226 ( defined in theorem 1 ) because @xmath227 .",
    "hence the upper bound function for fixed @xmath18 is locally an decreasing function of @xmath151 .",
    "so we can assume that all of these triangles have the same maximal spherical lengths are equal to @xmath228 .",
    "thus we get the following upper bound for the volume : @xmath229 @xmath230 where @xmath231 and @xmath232 . but with this conditions",
    "as we can check in section 5 ( at in[30 ] ) @xmath233 implying that @xmath234 as we stated .",
    "in this section we assume that the examined face @xmath235 of the polyhedron @xmath13 has @xmath12 sides",
    ". then we have @xmath12 points of a circle with center @xmath38 of the unit sphere which corresponds to a spherical convex polygon and also an rectilineal polygon with the same set of vertices @xmath236 , respectively .",
    "we introduce the concept of _ central angle _",
    "@xmath237 which is the half of the convex angle @xmath238 when the line @xmath239 does not separate @xmath38 to the other vertices of the polygon , and it is the half of the value @xmath240 in the other case",
    ". then the angle @xmath241 corresponds to the edge @xmath239 .",
    "analogously , we can introduce the angles @xmath242 which is the angle of the spherical triangle @xmath243 at the vertex @xmath244 ( and @xmath245 ) , where @xmath47 is the central projection of @xmath38 to the sphere .",
    "now the proof of prop .",
    "2 can be modified as follows .",
    "if the rectilineal polygon contains @xmath38 then @xmath246 @xmath247 on the domain @xmath248 it is a concave function of two variables ( see p.267 in @xcite ) .",
    "hence @xmath249 @xmath250 where the value of the right hand side is the area of a polygon @xmath251 whose edges @xmath252 have equal lengths for @xmath253 .",
    "( we note that the central projections upon the sphere of the two polygons have the same spherical excess @xmath254 . )",
    "compare now the altitudes @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the pyramids based on the two polygons , respectively .",
    "the spherical area of the first one is @xmath255 @xmath256 @xmath257 we get that @xmath258 on the other hand by @xmath60 we have @xmath259 implying that @xmath70 .",
    "we have to investigate also the second case , when @xmath260 separates @xmath38 and the other vertices to each other",
    ". then @xmath261 and we have @xmath262 on the other hand @xmath263 and the volume in question is @xmath264 we consider the maximum of @xmath265 under the conditions @xmath266 , @xmath267 and @xmath268 with respect to the unknown values @xmath237 and @xmath59 . as in the proof of proposition 2 , using lagrange s method we get @xmath269 equations of form @xmath270 these leads to the equations @xmath271 which can not be satisfied unless @xmath272 .",
    "hence if the corresponding sides of the polygon are not equals then the polygon is not a local extremum of our problem . on the other hand , by compactness ,",
    "it has at least one local maximum proving the following statement :    let @xmath273 be a convex polygon inscribed into a circle of the unit sphere .",
