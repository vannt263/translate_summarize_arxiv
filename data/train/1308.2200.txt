    "the study of disordered electronic systems is of major interest in condensed matter physics @xcite because randomness breaks translational invariance and leads to localized electron states . in noninteracting systems ,",
    "typically all the states are localized in one and two dimensions , even by small amounts of disorder @xcite , while in three dimensions , states with large and small energies are localized , and a ` mobility edge ' separates these from extended states near the center of the energy distribution . in real materials , disorder can arise from vacancies or impurity atoms , dislocations , and other forms of structural imperfections .",
    "the effect of interparticle interactions on these localized and extended states has proven to be a very challenging problem .",
    "experiments using silicon mosfets of very high purity now suggest @xcite that repulsive interactions might allow a metallic phase to exist in two dimensions .",
    "an equally interesting set of questions concerns the interplay of disorder and attractive interactions , and the occurrence of superconductor - insulator transitions .",
    "one well - studied issue is the existence of a universal conductivity in thin films @xcite .",
    "recently it has become possible to address the interplay of randomness and interactions within a new experimental context , namely that of ultracold fermionic and bosonic atomic gases confined to optical lattices @xcite . here the role of ` spin ' is played by atoms in different hyperfine states .",
    "disorder can be superimposed on the periodic optical lattices created by interfering counter - propagating lasers by means of the introduction of speckle fields@xcite .",
    "this randomness can now be made on the scale of the lattice constant .",
    "interactions between the atoms can be tuned through a feshbach resonance@xcite and can be either repulsive or attractive .",
    "optical lattice experiments do not just represent a new realization of model hamiltonians of interacting and disordered materials@xcite ; they also allow the study of situations which would be more difficult to achieve in the solid state .",
    "one possibility is `` spin''-dependent disorder in which atoms of different hyperfine structures do not see the same random potential , a natural follow - on to existing experiments where the optical lattice itself is spin - dependent@xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed theoretical study of such spin - dependent disorder .",
    "we consider the attractive fermion hubbard model in two dimensions , which has a low temperature superconducting phase , and include three types of spin - dependent disorder : 1 ) random potential on the up - spin but zero potential on the down - spin ; 2 ) random potential of the same strength but different realizations on each spin species ; 3 ) random hopping energies of the same strength , but again with different realizations on each spin species .. we study these cases with finite - temperature bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) mean - field theory@xcite .",
    "this bdg approach to the @xmath3 hubbard model allows us to examine the strong interaction and strong disorder regimes which are beyond the realm of validity of anderson s theorem@xcite .",
    "the mean - field approximation of course ignores fluctuations .",
    "some of the effects of extending beyond the mean - field are explored in ref .  .",
    "our key results are as follows : [ 1 ] unlike the case of spin independent randomness , for which bdg theory produces no transition as the disorder strength is increased , we show here that spin dependence produces a vanishing of the superconducting order parameter @xmath4 and energy gap @xmath5 ; [ 2 ] the critical points can be different for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , leading to a gapless superconducting phase ; and [ 3 ] models with different types of spin - dependent disorder behave in a qualitatively similar manner .",
    "results at zero temperature for this problem can also be found in ref .  .",
    "we begin with a description of the model and method in section ii , and present our most central results , the phase diagrams , in section iii .",
    "several additional details of the properties of these models are summarized in section iv .",
    "section v contains some concluding remarks .",
    "the rest of this introduction will provide more details for the experimental prospects for realizing spin - dependent disordered optical lattices .",
    "spin - independent disorder in a 3d optical lattice has been studied in the context of the disordered bose - hubbard model in refs .  .",
    "the phase diagram was determined through transport properties .",
    "non - interacting fermions in a spin - independent disordered 3d lattice have also been realized@xcite and used to demonstrate anderson localization with an accompanying mobility edge@xcite .",
    "however , experiments with spin dependent disorder have yet to be performed , but seem to be feasible @xcite .",
    "before discussing how that might be arranged , we review how the light field producing the optical lattice has already been coupled to atomic states in a spin - dependent way , thereby enabling spin - dependent optical lattices of ultra - cold atoms@xcite .",
    "the alkali atom @xmath6 has a single electron in its outermost s - shell , giving a @xmath7 electronic configuration with spin projections @xmath8 serving as the two spin - species .",
    "@xmath6 also has two excited states @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we ignore for now the complications of coupling between nuclear and electron spins .",
    "when the atom is in a laser light field of frequency away from the resonant frequency for excitation from the ground to the exited states , the effect of the oscillating electric field is to act as a perturbation which induces a new ground state with an electronic dipole moment by mixing the excited states with the atomic ground state .",
    "the induced dipole itself interacts with the electric field .",
    "the dipole potential energy is proportional to the product of the frequency dependent polarization @xmath11 and the light intensity , latexmath:[$\\langle    below or above resonance , the sign of @xmath11 can be switched .",
    "depending on this sign , the interaction energy is lowered if the atom is at positions of high or low field intensity . at resonance ,",
    "the atom absorbs and emits light , which is undesirable , therefore the laser has to be detuned away from the resonant frequency for atomic transitions .",
    "the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) states are coupled independently by right- ( left- ) circular polarizations to the @xmath10 ( @xmath9 ) excited states . by tuning the two circular polarizations independently of each other in the optical standing - wave lasers , a spin - dependent lattice can be realized .",
    "this optical lattice determines the hubbard model parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and chemical potential offset @xmath17 . as a consequence",
    ", these quantities can depend on the fermionic species @xmath18 , as described above .",
    "we now discuss how one might superimpose a disordered potential or hopping on top of the standing wave optical lattice in a similarly spin dependent fashion .",
    "present experimental techniques allow a controlled disordered potential to be created by passing a detuned laser ( monochromatic , phase - coherent light ) through a ground - glass plate diffuser@xcite .",
    "the light exits from points on the diffuser plane with random phases and is focused by a lens at the optical lattice located at the focal plane .",
    "the random phases interfere to produce a gaussian distributed electric field intensity .",
    "since the induced atomic dipole couples to the field intensity , the lattice potential depth thus becomes disordered .",
    "spin - dependent disorder can be created by passing detuned laser light with equal components of left and right circular polarizations through a birefringent diffuser with thickness much greater than the wavelength , so that the two polarizations exiting the diffuser acquire a much greater , uncorrelated phase difference between them @xcite .",
    "alternatively , two separate non - birefringent diffusers may be used , one for each circular polarization . in the latter scenario",
    ", it is easy to switch off disorder on one spin species by removing one of the diffusers .",
    "the lattice itself is created by standard techniques .",
    "we now turn to the hamiltonian which models such situations .",
    "the clean attractive hubbard hamiltonian @xmath19 describes a set of fermions hopping with amplitude @xmath15 on near neighbor sites ( in this paper we consider a square lattice ) and interacting on - site with an energy @xmath3 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath17 controls the filling . away from half - filling ,",

    "[ hbdg ] also introduces a chemical potential which includes the hartree shift , @xmath27 . randomness in the interactions can also be considered @xcite but we do not do that here .    the disorder we consider is uniformly distributed , @xmath28 , @xmath29 $ ] , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "evidently , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we scale all energy parameters @xmath16 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath17 to units where @xmath37 .",
    "we restrict our study to either potential or hopping disorders and do not analyze the case where both types of disorder are present simultaneously .",
    "we will find that the qualitative features of the phase diagram is not very sensitive to the details of the choice of disorder .",
    "it is worth noting that the probability distribution of the experimental disorder@xcite is of exponential form @xmath38 , and hence differs from our bounded randomness @xcite .",
    "in addition , in experiments , the fine - grain speckle is expected to disorder the hoppings , interactions and site energies together .",
    "for example , the tunneling amplitude @xmath39 depends on the absolute difference of well - depths of sites @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and hence not only does it exhibit randomness , but , in fact , randomness which is correlated with that in the site energies . similarly , the interaction @xmath42 depends on @xmath43 because the potential well modifies the single - particle wannier site basis functions , which determines @xmath44 .",

    "they must be obtained by ( numerical ) diagonalization .",
    "the local order parameter and density are determined self - consistently , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fermi function .",
    "these self - consistency conditions are equivalent to minimizing the free energy . to start the process of solving the bdg hamiltonian self - consistently , an initial random guess for @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "is made at every site .",
    "this guess is inserted into the matrix form of @xmath47 and the matrix diagonalized to get the bdg eigenvalues @xmath55 and eigenvectors @xmath56 . from these eigen - pairs , a new set of @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "is computed using eq .",
    "[ selfconsistent ] .",
    "this new set is reinserted into @xmath47 and the hamiltonian matrix rediagonalized , with the resulting eigen - pairs again fed into eq .",
    "[ selfconsistent ] .",
    "each cycle of this process defines one iteration , and the iterations are repeated until the @xmath53 , @xmath57 at every site differ from those of the previous iteration to within the specified accuracy , i.e , self - consistency is attained at every site@xcite .",
    "the chemical potentials are also adjusted in each iteration to achieve the desired density to the same accuracy .",
    "this accuracy is @xmath58 in all our final , self - consistent results .    to study the phase diagram , we define a spatially averaged order parameter , @xmath4 , from @xmath59 .",
    "the bdg spectrum can be used to determine the energy gap , @xmath5 , which is the lowest eigenvalue above the chemical potential .",
    "the spectrum and eigenfunctions also determine the density of states .",
    "note that unlike the spin - independent case the eigenvalues do not come in @xmath60 pairs and the distances of closest eigenvalues below and above the chemical potential are in general different . in principle",
    ", these latter two eigenvalues can be used to examine separately the positive gap ( the energy cost to add an additional quasiparticle to the system ) , and the negative gap ( the energy cost to extract a quasiparticle from the system , or to create a quasihole ) . in practice",
    ", however , we find their magnitudes are always approximately equal , so we show the data only for the positive gap .    in generating the phase diagrams , we average all our data over @xmath61 disorder realizations so that our results are not characteristic of any particular realization .",
    "such disorder averaging restores some of the symmetries of the model , as discussed in the following subsection .",
    "the greatest variation about the mean of results for individual realizations occurs close to the critical points , which is a typical signature of phase transition .",
    "away from the critical point we find that the values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 vary only by a few percent from realization to realization on lattices of size 24@xmath6224 .",
    "symmetries of the hamiltonian allow us to identify the conserved quantities ( and degeneracies of states ) , which in turn can simplify finding , and interpreting , the solutions . in considering the symmetries of eq .",
    "[ hbdg ] , it is useful to note that the spin - dependent term of @xmath47 can be written as the sum of a random local chemical potential @xmath63 and a random local zeeman field , @xmath64 .",
    "this allows us to make connections to previous work in which zeeman field terms are considered , as we point out in our results section .",
    "the most obvious implication of disorder on symmetries of the model is that it breaks translational invariance .",
    "in fact , it is often useful to take advantage of the spatial inhomogeneities in individual realizations of randomness , for example , by examining correlations between the distribution of the local @xmath59 and excited state wave functions .",
    "( see below and the discussion in ref .  ) .",
    "disorder averaging restores translational symmetry , at least for physical quantities like correlation functions .",
    "most of our results reflect this averaging .",
    "the spin - dependent terms break spin rotational invariance and have implications for time - reversal symmetry .",
    "if we define @xmath35 as the second - quantized time - reversal operator , we find that @xmath65=0 $ ] provided that @xmath66 .",
    "this means time reversal symmetry is preserved in the mean field approximation , provided that we also choose @xmath67 . as discussed in ref .",
    ", when there is site disorder only on one spin species , the chemical potentials required to maintain equal populations are indeed identical for disorder strengths below a critical threshold .",
    "however , beyond that value , equal populations occur only when the chemical potentials are tuned to different values .",
    "in that situation , time reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously , @xmath68\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "time reversal symmetry implies that every energy eigenstate is at least doubly degenerate .",
    "anderson s theorem states that for weakly disordered superconductivity , noninteracting eigenstates related by time reversal can be paired with each other to form cooper pairs@xcite .",
    "when time reversal is broken at @xmath69 in our bdg model , there are no more pair states related by time reversal so the tendency for sc order is diminished .",
    "this is the qualitative origin of the transitions we observe which are absent in the spin - independent case .",
    "there can still be pairing between time reversal broken pairs .",
    "as an example , in 2d clean systems with a uniform parallel zeeman field , one has the pairing term @xmath70 , in addition to the spin population imbalance .",
    "this is the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) condensate@xcite which carries a finite momentum @xmath71 , and when expressed as a stationary wave , has sinusoidal , sign - changing @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , when we relax the constraint of spin balance ( but keep total density fixed with a single @xmath17 ) in our system , we find that the spin population becomes imbalanced beyond the @xmath72 bifurcation point , and the @xmath59 has regions of sign - changing values .",
    "we thus obtain a transition from disordered bcs to disordered fflo ( or dlo ) when we relax density conservation of each spin ( ie : fixed @xmath73 ) .",
    "the time reversal non - invariance of @xmath47 means the ground - state is not time reversal invariant as well , implying that it carries finite momentum , and hence must have a spatially varying phase @xmath74 .",
    "finally , we consider particle - hole symmetry .",
    "as is well known , on bipartite lattices the kinetic and interaction terms are invariant under the transformation , @xmath75 here the phase factor @xmath76 on the a(b ) sublattices respectively . this is true even when the hopping and interaction strengths are random .",
    "local chemical potential terms are however not invariant under this particle - hole transformations , but instead change sign ( and introduce an irrelevant constant shift to the hamiltonian ) .",
    "this seemingly suggests that the two models with random site energies @xmath77 are not particle - hole symmetric . however , because the distribution of randomness is chosen so that @xmath78 , particle - hole symmetry is satisfied on average . meanwhile , the third model with random hopping @xmath79 is exactly particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the consequence of these observations is that all correlation functions and the resulting phase diagram of the random hopping hamiltonian are precisely symmetric about half - filling .",
    "approximate symmetry is expected , and confirmed numerically for site energy disorder . in what follows",
    "we therefore show results only for @xmath80 .",
    "we note that the presence or absence of particle hole symmetry has been found to be central to the appearance of metal - insulator transitions in the repulsive hubbard hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe properties shared by all three spin - dependent disorder hamiltonians .",
    "although of course the quantitative positions of the boundaries vary , the basic topology of the phase diagrams is the same .",
    "we use the following notation to refer to the models : @xmath81 refers to the model with site disorder on both spins , @xmath82 to the model with site disorder on one spin only , and @xmath83 to the model with hopping disorder on both spins .    in constructing the phase diagrams",
    ", we define the vanishing of @xmath4 and @xmath5 to occur when their values become less than @xmath84 . above the critical point , @xmath5 and @xmath4",
    "fluctuate randomly on the _ same _ order as the @xmath85 cutoff .",
    "we have also shown that these residual values scale to zero with increasing lattice size.@xcite a final justification for our chosen cutoff comes from the observation that the realization - to - realization fluctuations of @xmath86 and @xmath4 are comparable to the cutoff .",
    "we also use the terms  no sc \" and  ( anderson ) insulator \" interchangeably since , quite generally , the unordered phase of a non - interacting 2d lattice is an anderson insulator for arbitrary disorder strength .",
    "the presence of attractive interactions is expected to enhance further the effective depth of the potential wells ( minima of @xmath87 ) , thus making the localization tendency for the opposite spin - species greater in the mean - field approximation .",
    "all phase diagrams are for @xmath88 and @xmath89 unless we are varying @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",

    "this result is consistent with a recent bdg study of a 1d balanced system @xmath133 which similarly found no sign - changes in @xmath59 in the presence of a single magnetic impurity , despite the presence of local spin - imbalance and a reduced value of @xmath59 at and around the defect @xcite . on the other hand , in the same study",
    ", the authors also find that a sufficiently extended magnetic impurity in 1d and 3d , for example , with a gaussian profile , does result in both a local spin - imbalance and sign - changes in @xmath59 ( fflo phase ) .",
    "similarly , another recent bdg study@xcite in 1d with @xmath133 and a spin - dependent lattice [ @xmath134 concluded that  @xmath135 phases \" which exhibit sign - changing @xmath59 require spin - dependent lattices with wave - length longer than the coherence length .",
    "thus the absence of sign - changing @xmath59 in our work is due to our choice of spatially uncorrelated random magnetic impurities at every site and consequently a spin - dependent lattice potential with wavelength much less than the coherence length .",
    "current experiments can introduce such very rapidly varying laser speckle @xcite .",
    "to understand better the physics of spin - dependent disorder within the 2d attractive hubbard model , we explored some particular features of the @xmath81 model .    in figure  [ fig10 ] ( c )",
    "we show the particle density histogram for @xmath136 . for @xmath137 ,",
    "we find the disorder landscape favors site fillings of approximately zero , one , or two particles . for @xmath138",
    ", we see that the histogram has only two peaks at fillings of zero and two .",
    "this can also be seen in figures  [ fig10 ] ( a , b ) .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( a ) , for @xmath131 , shows @xmath5 and @xmath4 increase without bound versus @xmath90 and @xmath139 , as is always the case for spin - dependent disorder ; but in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( b ) , for @xmath132 and for strong enough @xmath140 , we find that @xmath141 and saturates . in previous spin - independent bdg work in ref .",
    ", it was found that @xmath142 for all disorder strengths .",
    "here we find that we recover some of the results of the spin - independent disorder for @xmath143 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( d ) we show the evolution of the site - averaged , squared local - moment , @xmath144 , as a function of @xmath90 for three disorder strengths , @xmath145 at @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath137 , the moment starts out at its maximum possible value . this maximum value is larger for greater @xmath34 because the potential minima for the @xmath146-fermions and @xmath147-fermions are in general at different sites due to the spin - dependent randomness .",
    "as @xmath90 increases , it becomes energetically favorable for two fermions of opposite spin to occupy the same site forming a singlet , and as a result , decreasing the local moment all the way to zero for very large @xmath90 .",
    "the destruction of the average local - moment is seen to occur at roughly the same @xmath90 value where the cross - over from @xmath148 to @xmath149 takes place in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( b ) .",
    "spin - independent disorder always has the property @xmath150 , since both spin - species see the same potential landscape .",
    "the average local - moment destruction for large @xmath90 is , therefore , also an indication that in the @xmath151 limit , we are in the spin - independent regime .",
    "before summarizing the results of this paper , we relate our study to previous classic investigations of magnetic impurities in superconductors .",
    "one of the earliest works on this topic was by abrikosov and gorkov ( ag)@xcite who considered a continuum model of a weak - coupling superconductor with dilute magnetic impurities in the form of randomly distributed and oriented classical spins coupled to the electrons via a rotationally invariant exchange interaction . as with our zeeman interaction ,",
    "this external magnetic field breaks time - reversal invariance and suppresses superconductivity since it is not protected by anderson s theorem @xcite .",
    "ag s mean field treatment uses the perturbative , self - consistent , born approximation .",
    "although the magnetic disorder results in an inhomogeneous @xmath59 , due to the diluteness of the impurities , @xmath59 is rather different from that considered here .",
    "it is predominantly spatially uniform except in the vicinity of the impurity moments .",
    "in fact , although their formalism admits inhomogeneity , in solving the resulting integral equation the order parameter is assumed constant .",
    "ag find that the quasiparticle energies and @xmath4 are modified in different ways and , as a consequence @xmath5 is suppressed more than @xmath4 .",
    "the more rapid decay of @xmath5 leads to a gapless sc phase , as found here .    to check the validity of ag theory in the strong disorder regime , we modified our bdg codes to enforce a spatially uniform @xmath59 equal to the site average of the inhomogeneous @xmath59 .",
    "we found that the region of gapless sc phase is greatly diminished compared to the case of inhomogeneous @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this illustrates the limitations of ag theory in addressing the physics of strong disorder , and it also validates our physical picture for the gapless sc phase .",
    "a nearly uniform @xmath59 precludes the possibility of a mechanism for the gapless sc phase based on our physical picture ( see below ) .    like ag ,",
    "our work is at the mean - field level .",
    "however , since it is based on the non - perturbative bdg mft , it can capture strong coupling effects , as well as strong inhomogeneities in @xmath59 which occur throughout the lattice and not just on widely separated impurity sites .",
    "as described earlier , these effects lead to a clear physical picture for the gapless sc phase namely , that the lowest lying quasi - particle / hole excited states lie in the anderson insulator regions where there is no sc order , and hence a zero excitation gap .",
    "such an interpretation is absent from ag theory .",
    "a further distinct feature of our work , as compared to the ag treatment , is that the non - interacting eigenstates are anderson localized ( in regions which are different for the up and down spins ) so our ` normal ' state is a ( spin - dependent ) anderson insulator , whereas the normal state of the ag model is band metallic .    in this paper",
    "we have explored the interplay of strong attractive interactions and spin - dependent disorder with rapid spatial variation .",
    "we have mapped out the ground state phase diagrams for various cases- when one species moves in an environment completely decoupled from the disorder , when both species see randomness , but the energy landscape is species dependent , and finally when the hopping is random , but dependent on the fermion spin .",
    "we find that , as the disorder is increased , in some situations the superconducting gap goes to zero first , followed by the order parameter .",
    "that is , there can be a gapless superconducting phase .",
    "our numerical results are for systems of finite size , most typically 24@xmath6224 lattices .",
    "some finite size scaling was used , for example to demonstrate small residual values of @xmath5 scale to zero with increasing system size .",
    "we should mention , however , that on these finite lattices it is difficult to access any physics associated with rare regions , e.g.  an exponential ` tail ' density - of - states which starts from the gap edge ( @xmath5 ) at a maximum and extends to @xmath152 , the so - called  soft gap \" @xcite .",
    "we have considered the phase diagram / equilibrium thermodynamics here , but transport properties pose some interesting questions .",
    "for example , when @xmath102 and one spin species sees no disorder , it will be metallic while the other is insulating .",
    "as the attractive @xmath16 is turned on , the metallic species will see an induced randomness . at @xmath16 nonzero",
    "will both species be localized or extended , or can there be parameter regimes where there is a ` spin selective anderson transition ' ?",
    "mean field approaches such as the bdg treatment used here are , of course , only approximate , and are problematic at finite temperatures since they ignore phase fluctuations .",
    "studies of the attractive hubbard model with quantum monte carlo methods offer a way to treat the interactions exactly , although on lattices of smaller size than with the bdg approach described here .",
    "quantum monte carlo can go to very low temperatures and access the superconducting phase , if it exists , because there is no sign problem either in the clean case @xcite or for randomness which is the same for both spin species @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , spin - dependent disorder will introduce a sign problem @xcite in determinant quantum monte carlo even for the case of attractive interactions .",
    "indeed , once one allows for both a non - zero chemical potential and a non - zero zeeman field , the positive and negative @xmath16 hubbard models can be mapped onto each other exactly .",
    "thus we expect limited ability to address the physics of spin dependent disorder with this method .",
    "studies via dynamical mean field theory , on the other hand are feasible at low temperature , and would offer a more precise theoretical point of contact than the present mean field treatment with optical lattice experiments when they are performed .",
