    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are brief flashes of @xmath0-rays occurring at an average detection rate of a few events per day at cosmological distances . because of their very high luminosity ,",
    "grbs can be detected out to the edge of the visible universe ( ciardi & loeb 2000 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 ; gou et al .",
    "thus , grbs are ideal tools for probing the star formation rate , the reionization history , and the metal enrichment history of the universe ( totani 1997 ; campana et al . 2007 ;",
    "bromm & loeb 2007 ) .",
    "the advantages of grbs over quasars for probing the high - redshift universe had been discussed by bromm & loeb ( 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , grbs have been used as standard candles to constrain cosmological parameters and dark energy ( dai , liang & xu 2004 ; friedman & bloom 2005 ; wang & dai 2006 ; schaefer 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "the association of long grbs with core - collapse supernovae naturally suggests that the cosmic grb rate should trace the star formation history .",
    "this gave rise to the expectation that grbs may be a good tracer of cosmic star formation ( totani 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1998 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ; blain & natarajan 2000 ; porciani & madau 2001 ) .",
    "however , it was found that the rate of grbs increases with cosmic redshift faster than the ordinary star formation rate ( sfr ) does ( daigne et al .",
    "2006 ; le & dermer 2007 ; kistler et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; yksel & kistler 2007 ; cen & fang 2007 ; li 2008 ; wang & dai 2009 ; butler et al . 2010 ; wanderman & piran 2010 ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy has been unknown .    by investigating the redshift distribution of _ swift _",
    "grbs , guetta & piran ( 2007 ) found that the observed high - redshift bursts are more than the expectation from an ordinary star formation history ( sfh ) and thus the high - redshift grb rate is inconsistent with the one inferred from the current model for the sfr .",
    "furthermore , kistler et al . (",
    "2008 ) found that the grb rate at redshift @xmath1 is about four times larger than expected from star formation measurements .",
    "daigne et al .",
    "( 2006 ) concluded that grb properties or progenitors must evolve with cosmic redshift to reconcile the observed grb redshift distribution with the measured sfh .",
    "li ( 2008 ) explained the observed discrepancy between the grb rate history and the star formation rate history as being due to cosmic metallicity evolution , by assuming that long grbs tend to occur in galaxies with low metallicities .",
    "however , very recently levesque et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) found several high - metallicity long grb host environments , which suggests that a low - metallicity cut - off is unlikely ( also see graham et al .",
    "xu & wei ( 2008 ) used a factitious stellar initial mass function ( imf ) evolving with redshift to interpret the grb redshift distribution .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested that this discrepancy could be eliminated if some high - redshift grbs are ascribed to electromagnetic bursts of superconducting cosmic strings , although the existence of the superconducting cosmic strings has remained controversial .    in this letter , we first enlarge the grb sample with 122 long grbs observed by _",
    "swift_. then we interpret the latest _ swift _ grb redshift distribution using a reasonable evolving stellar initial mass function ( imf ) proposed by dav ( 2010 ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we give an evolving initial mass function form , and in section 3 , we show the analysis method .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 and conclusions are shown in section 5 .",
    "the ordinary form of stellar imf proposed by salpeter ( 1955 ) is @xmath2 it was shown that the high - redshift grb rate exceeds the expectation based on the above sfr .",
    "this leads us to invoking a different form of stellar imf .",
    "the possibility of an evolving imf was discussed several times in the literature ( e.g. larson 1998 , 2005 ; ferguson , dickinson & papovich 2002 ; fardal et al .",
    "2007 ; van dokkum 2008 ) .",
    "kroupa ( 2001 ) pointed out that a universal imf is not expected theoretically , though no variations had been unequivocally detected in the studies of local star - forming regions .",
    "scalo ( 1998 ) mentioned that although the imf index may vary at different redshifts in the universe , its average value is close to the salpeter value .",
    "wilkins , trentham & hopkins ( 2008 ) independently determined the cosmic stellar mass growth rate by compiling observations of stellar mass densities from the literature and suggested an evolving imf to interpret the discrepancy between the stellar mass density and sfh . in order to reconcile the discrepancy between the theory predicting the galaxy stellar mass - sfr relation with the observations , dav ( 2008 ) proposed an evolving imf with the following form @xmath3 where @xmath4 , which has been constrained by requiring non - evolving star formation activity parameter .",
    "it is worth noting that this evolving imf is only constrained out to @xmath5 from the galaxy stellar mass - sfr relation , though its predictions are consistent with the other observations out to @xmath6 .",
    "chary ( 2008 ) found that this imf would produce sufficient ionizing photons to account for late reionization of the intergalactic medium if it evolved out to @xmath7 .",
    "so the imf suggested by dav ( 2008 ) can be used to @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , dav ( 2010 ) found @xmath8 using the herschel data .",
    "we consider a spatial volume @xmath9 at redshift @xmath10 . the imf can be written as @xmath11 , so @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the sfr",
    ", @xmath14 is the largest mass of stars and @xmath15 is the smallest mass of stars .",
    "we consider only massive stars with masses larger than @xmath16 can produce grbs ( woosley 1993 ; bissaldi et al .",
    "2007 ) , so @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant to be constrained and @xmath19 is the rate of grbs , representing the number of grbs per unit time per unit volume at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "we use the sfr derived by hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) , @xmath20 with @xmath21 le borgne et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used mid- and far - infrared observations to constrain the sfr and found that sfh is well - constrained and consistent with direct measurements from hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) .",
    "so we also use the results of hopkins & beacom ( 2006 )",
    ".    then the observed rate of grbs within @xmath22 and @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the beaming - convolved luminosity function of grbs , @xmath26 is due to cosmological time dilation and @xmath27  sr is the solid angle covered on the sky by _ swift _ ( salvaterra & chincarini 2007 ) . in a flat universe , the comoving volume is calculated by @xmath28 where the comoving distance is @xmath29 in the calculations , we use @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32=70 km  s@xmath33  mpc@xmath33 .",
    "there are many luminosity function forms in the literature .",
    "we use the schechter - function form @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constant parameters to be determined by the observational data .",

    "we use 122 long grbs observed by _ _",
    "_ ] till grb 090726 ( butler et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath40 for the 122 grbs in the sample is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the luminosity threshold can be approximated by a bolometric energy flux limit @xmath43erg @xmath44 s@xmath33 .",
    "the luminosity threshold is then @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the luminosity distance to the burst .    with the above luminosity threshold and",
    "an adopted grb rate history , the observed luminosity distribution can be fitted by an intrinsic schechter luminosity function with a power - law index @xmath47 , a characteristic luminosity @xmath48 erg s@xmath33 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "in order to study the rates of grbs and star formation , it is convenient to use a dimensionless @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is defined by ( kistler et al .",
    "2007 ) @xmath53 the coordinate @xmath51 is particularly useful in binning the data , as the definition of @xmath51 has taken into account both the effect of the comoving volume and the effect of cosmic time dilation . for example , when the comoving rate density of grbs was a constant , in each equally sized bin of @xmath51 , the observed grbs number would be a constant .",
    "the complete grb selection function is very difficult to determine ( coward 2007 ) .",
    "we choose the grbs in the cuts @xmath54erg s@xmath33 and in the redshift range @xmath55 ( kistler et al .",
    "this method can reduce the selection effect by removing many low-@xmath10 , low-@xmath40 bursts that could not have been seen at higher redshifts .",
    "there are 72 grbs in this sample .",
    "the sfr fit from hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) in this range is shown as the dotted line in fig .",
    "2 . we can see the grb rate is incompatible with the expectation from the ordinary sfr .",
    "the solid line shows the cumulative distribution of the 72 _ swift _ grbs . the result from an evolving imf suggested by dav ( 2010 )",
    "is shown as the solid line , which agrees with the observed data very well .    from eqs ( 8) , ( 11 ) and ( 14 )",

    "( [ lum_lim ] ) .",
    "we use the luminosity cut @xmath60erg s@xmath33 ( li 2008 ) .",
    "the cut in luminosity and redshift minimizes the selection effect in the grb data .",
    "the total number of grbs with @xmath61 is 72 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath51 for the 72 _ swift _ grbs is plotted in fig .",
    "3 . because of the flux limit of the detector ( kistler et al .",
    "2008 ) , the model deviates from the data at @xmath7 . the solid line shows the best fit of the @xmath19 to the first six data points using an evolving imf .",
    "the dashed line shows the best fit from non - evolving imf .",

    "[ lum_lim ] .",
    "we can see that the modeled @xmath62 fits the observational data very well with @xmath64 .",
    "however , there is an obvious excess in the number of grbs in the bin of @xmath65 , which might be caused by statistical fluctuations .",
    "if we exclude it , the @xmath66 decreases to 0.32 .",
    "in this letter , we have presented that the redshift distribution of _ swift _ grbs with measured redshifts and calculated luminosities can be successfully fitted by the sfh with an evolving stellar imf .",
    "it is widely considered by current theories that only massive stars with masses larger than the critical value can produce long grbs .",
    "the evolving stellar imf becoming increasingly top heavy at larger @xmath10 suggested by dav ( 2010 ) can lead to more grbs produced at high redshifts .",
    "kistler et al . ( 2008 ) considered several possible reasons for the discrepancy between the _ swift _ grb rate and the sfh .",
    "they showed that the kolmogorov - smirnov test does not favor an interpretation as a statistical anomaly .",
    "selection effects are also unlikely to cause an increased efficiency in detecting high - redshift grbs . although kistler et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have argued that alternative reasons are possible ( e.g. , evolution in the fraction of binary systems , an evolving imf of stars , cosmic metallicity evolution ) , they did not give a quantitative analysis or a detailed discussion of the evolving imf .",
    "we enlarged the grb sample with 122 long grbs and used a reasonable evolving imf .",
    "the results in this paper indicate that the evolving imf may explain the redshift distribution of _ swift _ grbs .",
    "if the redshift distribution of grbs and sfh are well measured , grbs would be used to probe the stellar imf at high redshifts .",
