    "recently , strutted learning has attracted much attention from both machine learning and computer vision communities @xcite .",
    "traditional machine learning problems , including pattern classification and regression problems , try to learn a predictor to predict a discrete class label or a continuous response value from a input feature vector of a data sample .",
    "different from the traditional machine learning , structured learning aims to learn predictors to predict structured outputs , such as vectors , sequences , trees , and graphs .",
    "some structured learning methods have been developed for this purpose .",
    "for example , tsochantaridis et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the structured support vector machines ( ssvm ) proposed to generalize multiclass svm learning by involving features extracted jointly from inputs and structured outputs , and solving the resulting optimization problem with a cutting plane algorithm .",
    "shen et al .",
    "@xcite standardized boosting approaches to structured learning , and proposed the a new boosting algorithm for structured output prediction , by formulating an equivalent 1-slack formulation and solving it using a combination of cutting planes and column generation .",
    "a basic assumption of these methods is that for all the training samples , both the input feature vectors and the structured outputs are available for the learning problem .",
    "however , in the real - world applications , it may be expensive or difficult to obtain the structured output for a given data sample , making that the outputs of most training samples are unavailable .",
    "learning from a limited number of training samples with corresponding structured outputs is usually not robust for a structured learning task .",
    "recently , domain transfer learning @xcite has been proposed to solve this problem with help of a data domain with adequate labeled data samples to learn a predictor for another domain with limited labels .",
    "the domain with adequate labeled data samples are named as source domain , while the other one is named as target domain .",
    "they share the same input and output space , but the input distributions are significantly different .",
    "although lots of domain transfer learning algorithms have been developed , surprisingly , they are all limited to predict simple class label , and ignore the problem of predicting structured complex output . in this paper",
    ", we extend the domain transfer learning to predict structured outputs by defining a novel learning problem  domain transfer structured output learning .",
    "this problem has the following features :    1 .   a source domain",
    "are provided to help learning a predictor for a target domain , and both the domains share the same input and output space .",
    "the input distributions of source and target domains are significantly different , making it impossible to combine the two domains directly for the learning .",
    "the outputs are structured and complex .",
    "the outputs of the data samples in the source domain are all available , while only a limited number of the target domain samples have corresponding outputs .    to solve this problem , we first learn a structured output predictor using only the source domain , and then transfer it to the target domain by add a additional delta function . to learn the delta function parameter , we consider the data samples with outputs in the target domain with structured outputs .",
    "a objective function is build by comparing the predicted outputs against the true outputs of these data samples in the target domain , and is optimized using a cutting plane algorithm .",
    "the rest parts of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] , we introduce the proposed method . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , the paper is concluded .",
    "given a source domain @xmath0 with many input / output pairs , we can learn a scoring function @xmath1 to math a given input vector @xmath2 and a structure output @xmath3 , and use it to construct a predictor to predict the output @xmath4 of a given input feature @xmath5 , @xmath6 . given",
