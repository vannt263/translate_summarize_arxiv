    "the @xmath0 decay of the @xmath1 = -2 nucleus @xmath2zn has been studied recently @xcite . among the interesting results ,",
    "a rare and exotic decay mode has been observed for the first time in the @xmath4 shell , the @xmath0-delayed @xmath3-proton emission .",
    "here we provide more detail of the data analysis , not discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is important for the proper determination of the @xmath0-decay strengths .",
    "we focus on the determination and subsequent analysis of the charged - particle spectrum measured by the double - sided silicon strip detector ( dsssd ) .",
    "the @xmath0-decay experiment was performed at ganil using a @xmath5ni@xmath6 primary beam of 3.7 e@xmath7a , accelerated to 74.5 mev / nucleon and fragmented on a 200 @xmath7 m thick @xmath8ni target .",
    "the fragments were selected by the lise3 separator and implanted into a dsssd ( 300 @xmath7 m thick ) , surrounded by four exogam ge clovers for @xmath3 detection .",
    "the dsssd had 16 x and 16 y strips , defining 256 pixels .",
    "the dsssd was used to detect both the implanted fragments and subsequent charged - particle decays , by employing two parallel electronic chains of different gain .",
    "an implantation event was defined by simultaneous signals in both a silicon @xmath9 detector located upstream and the dsssd .",
    "the implanted ions were identified by combining the energy loss signal in the @xmath9 detector and the time - of - flight ( tof ) defined as the time difference between the cyclotron radio - frequency and the @xmath9 signal ( see fig .",
    "[ idplot ] ) .",
    "decay events were defined as giving a signal above threshold ( 50 - 90 kev ) in the dsssd and no coincident @xmath9 signal .",
    "the @xmath10 is defined as the time difference between a decay event in a given pixel of the dsssd and any implantation signal that occurred before and after it in the same pixel and also satisfied the conditions required to identify the nuclear species .",
    "this procedure ensured that all the true correlations were taken into account .",
    "however many random correlations were also included producing , as expected , a large constant background . the correlation - time spectrum for @xmath2zn including all the decays ( @xmath0s and protons ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a .",
    "the dsssd charged - particle spectrum was formed as it follows .",
    "first a spectrum containing both true and random correlations was formed by setting a gate from 0 to 1 s on the time correlation ( fig . [ fig2]a ) .",
    "a background ( bg ) spectrum formed only of randoms was created by selecting time correlations from -40 to -10 s. the two spectra were then normalized to the time bin used , and the dsssd spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b was formed by subtracting them .",
    "this procedure is similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the difference that there the gate for the bg spectrum was chosen from 1 to 2 s. using a larger time gate ( 30 s ) we have increased the statistics of the bg spectrum , which has the advantage of reducing the fluctuations arising from the subtraction of the two spectra .",
    "this is important in a case such as @xmath2zn where the number of counts is low .",
    "moreover , the choice of an interval on the left of the time peak ensures that only randoms are included in the bg spectrum .",
    "the dsssd spectrum was calibrated using an @xmath11-particle source and the peaks of known energy from the decay of @xmath12ni @xcite .",
    "most of the strength in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b is interpreted as @xmath0-delayed proton emission .",
    "the resolution is limited by the summing with the coincident @xmath0 particles , which also affects the lineshape of the peak .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed for a silicon dsssd strip , using the 4.9.6 geant4 code .",
    "the radioactive sources were located in an extended area in the middle of the detector , with an implantation profile obtained from lise calculations .",
    "protons of a given energy @xmath13 were emitted at the same time as @xmath0 particles following a distribution determined by the fermi function ( @xmath0-decay event generator ) , with end - point energy corresponding to @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the proton separation energy in the daughter nucleus ) . at the event generation level a widening of 70 kev fwhm was imposed , corresponding to the dsssd experimental resolution .",
    "as an example , the result of the simulations for a single level at @xmath16 = 1.7 mev ( @xmath13 = 1.1 mev ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c . to a good approximation",
    "the lineshape is given by a gaussian plus an exponential high - energy tail .",
    "this result is an additional confirmation of the procedure widely used in ref @xcite .",
    "the lineshape obtained from the simulations , which was also checked with the well isolated @xmath17zn peak at @xmath13 = 4.6 mev , was then used to fit the experimental spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "the shape was kept fixed ( i.e. , the gaussian - exponential joining and the slope of the exponential ) , while the parameters of the gaussian ( height , mean , sigma ) were fitted to the experimental proton peaks .",
    "this procedure allows one to determine the intensities of the proton peaks properly and hence obtain the @xmath0-decay strengths .",
