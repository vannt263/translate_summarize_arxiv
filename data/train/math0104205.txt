    "in a recent paper  @xcite , hereafter referred to as `` _ tpi _ '' we introduced a novel empirical characterisation of the sequence of twin primes .",
    "notation , nomenclature and conventions developed in _",
    "tpi _ are carried over here .",
    "there are three salient features of the model .",
    "first is the viewpoint that the sequence of twins is most naturally and usefully considered as a subset of the primes rather than in terms of the natural numbers .",
    "the second feature is that for the finite subset of primes less than some number @xmath0 , twins occur in the manner of fixed - probability random events . _",
    "i.e. , _ there is a constant probability that each successive prime following a given twin is itself the first member of the next twin .",
    "the third feature is that this `` constant '' probability is not universal .",
    "it varies in a rather simple way with the _ length _ of the sequence of primes up to @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a number of aspects of and make predictions which follow directly and indirectly from this new model for the distribution of twins . in the next section , we shall briefly describe the details of our empirical model .",
    "the following section consists of two separate results .",
    "first are probabilistic predictions for the occurrences of large gaps in the sequence of twins .",
    "these predictions are verified by direct comparison in the regime in which the model was constructed .",
    "one important comment that must be made is that the gaps that we note are separations in the sequence of primes",
    ". those usually quoted in the literature are _ arithmetic differences _ , or spacings in the natural numbers .",
    "the second result we report is that the so - called `` high - jumper '' ( the most probable prime separation ) is zero in our model .",
    "our results do not admit a direct comparison with high - jumper analyses extant in the literature which are concerned with most probable natural number separations between twins less than a given @xmath0 .",
    "the model that we consider is empirical in that it is derived from a direct analysis of the distribution of twin primes less than @xmath1 . the essential feature which provides the key to the success of the model is that the distribution of twins is considered in the context of the primes alone rather than within the natural numbers .",
    "the model is based upon the observation that twins less than some number @xmath0 seem to occur as fixed - probability random events in the sequence of primes .",
    "that is , there is a characteristic distribution of _ prime separations _ which may expressed in the form @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the number of primes less than or equal to @xmath0 , @xmath4 is the _ prime separation _ ( the number of unpaired _ singleton _ primes occuring between two twins ) , and @xmath5 is a decay parameter which is constant for a given @xmath0 , but varies with @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath6 is the continuous probability density that a given pair of twins in the sequence of primes up to @xmath0 has prime separation @xmath4 .",
    "it is properly normalized : @xmath7 .",
    "we chose a representative sample of prime sequences and determined the decay constants for each .",
    "we began our analysis with @xmath8 , discarding the anomalous twin @xmath9 .",
    "the variation of the decay parameters  the slopes on a plot of log(frequency ) _ versus _ separation  is well - described by the following function : @xmath10 we refer the interested readers to _ tpi _ for detailed discussion of the derivation of this result and reinforcement of the claim that this form for @xmath5 is consistent with the prime number theorem , the twin prime conjecture , and the hardy  littlewood conjecture for twins .",
    "armed with this model for the distribution of twins we now undertake some analyses of its predictions .",
    "those who are actively enumerating twin primes are quite interested in the occurrences of large gaps  @xcite . in our probabilistic model",
    "we can make estimates for the threshold number at which we might expect particular large prime separations to appear .",
    "the analysis below does just that . there is a caveat however : the gaps that we determine are prime separations , while the gaps referred to in the literature are gaps in the natural number sequence ( _ i.e.",
    ", _ arithmetic differences between an element of a twin and the corresponding element of its immediate predecessor ) .    to determine likelihood thresholds for large prime separations , we need to convolve the behaviour of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath11 with its role in expressing the probability ( or frequency ) of separations @xmath12 .",
    "simply put , the probability that a particular large prime separation @xmath13 occurs is ( we set @xmath14 ) @xmath15 in this expression for the probability , we have merely taken ( [ prob ] ) and inserted our empirical fit for @xmath5 ( [ mfunc ] ) where , for convenience , we have written @xmath16 instead of the central value of the constant 1.321 .",
    "the probability is the expected normalised frequency of each type of gap among the @xmath17 twins ( actually there are @xmath18 gaps between the twins , but we drop the -1 in this analysis ) .    while this is completely correct as it stands , and provides the probability that a prime separation of magnitude @xmath13 occurs somewhere within the subset of first primes with length @xmath3 , this not quite what is wanted . instead of looking for a gap of length @xmath13",
    ", we should be considering _ any _ gap of length greater than or equal to @xmath13 . to accomplish this ,",
    "we integrate @xmath12 from @xmath13 to @xmath19 , and obtain the probability that a prime separation @xmath20 occurs @xmath21 let us set a",
    "_ minimum threshold _ of @xmath22 separation `` events '' out of the total number , @xmath17 , where @xmath22 is a risk factor allowing one to be more cautious ( @xmath23 ) or more daring ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "fixing @xmath25 leads to a relation among the size of the gap , the prime and twin counts , and the risk factor : @xmath26 to cast this in a more useful form , we will utilise the well - known approximate formulae for @xmath3 and @xmath17 quoted in _ tpi_. @xmath27 with these approximations , ( [ sl+prob1 ] ) becomes @xmath28 \\",
    ",   \\big [ \\log(n ) - 2 \\log ( \\log(n ) ) + \\log ( 2 c_2 ) - \\log(f ) \\big ] \\ . \\label{gapper}\\ ] ] while this equation does not admit simple inversion to determine @xmath29 , it is readily graphed .",
    "we do this below up to prime separations of about @xmath30 allowing us to compare the predictions of our probabilistic model with the data .",
    "-90 = 3.5 in = 4.5 in    as one can see from the graph , the probabilistic model yields predictions which conform extremely well with the available data .",
    "the shape of the curves which bound our cautious ",
    "daring range is consistent with the hardy  littlewood conjecture for twins in that the twins become more sparse among the primes as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the high - jumper at any fixed @xmath0 is the natural number separation which occurs most frequently between consecutive primes less than @xmath0 .",
    "the high - jumpers are observed to increase with @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "exactly the same analysis can be carried over to the case of twins .",
    "we refine the notion of a twin high - jumper to conform to our viewpoint that it is the distribution of twins among the primes themselves , not the natural numbers , which is significant . in other words",
    "our twin high - jumper is the most probable prime separation at any given @xmath0 . with our probabilistic decay model for the occurrence of twins",
    ", it necessarily follows that the _ most likely _ high - jumper for twins is always zero .",
    "we note that this claim is crucially dependent upon our model for the slope @xmath31 tending to @xmath32 ( or any finite negative value ) rather than a positive value as @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , we recognise that since the slowly - varying probability model for the occurrence of twins is stochastic , there may exist ranges of @xmath0 for which the high - jumper is actually @xmath34 or @xmath35 or greater .",
    "in this paper , we report on two results that follow straightforwardly from our novel characterisation of the sequence of twin primes as slowly - varying probability random events among the primes themselves .",
    "the first is that the model can be used to make probabilistic predictions for the onset of appearance of prime separations of a given ( large ) size .",
    "we have done this and the predictions agree very well in the regime where we have data .",
    "we believe that the predictions extrapolate and remain valid beyond the range of our data .",
    "the second result is that the so - called _ twin prime high - jumper , _ the mode prime separation , is always predicted to be zero by the very structure of the empirical model .",
