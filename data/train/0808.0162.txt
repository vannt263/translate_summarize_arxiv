    "the higgs boson is the missing piece of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak and strong interactions .",
    "its mass is a free parameter of the theory , but direct searches at lep have set a lower bound at 114.4  gev @xcite and precision electroweak data from lep and the tevatron suggest light higgs scenarios , with @xmath0  gev at 95% cl .    the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a proton - proton accelerator installed in a 27  km tunnel close to geneva , and two general purpose experiments - atlas and cms - were designed to search for the higgs boson and evidences of new physics beyond the stardard model . the first lhc data is expected within the year 2008 at a center of mass energy of 10  tev .",
    "after the initial machine commissioning , the accelerator should operate at its nominal energy of 14  tev from 2009 on .",
    "this proceeding describes the discovery potential of the higgs boson decaying to four leptons - electrons and muons - in atlas .",
    "this has been recently evaluated with dedicated simulated samples including the signal and corresponding backgrounds produced using the full detector description and reconstruction software .",
    "the main production modes for the higgs boson at the lhc are showed in fig .  [",
    "fig : higgs_production ] .",
    "gluon - fusion is the dominant process , accounting for approximately 80% depending on the mass , followed by weak boson fusion ( wbf ) .",
    "the higgs decays preferentially to the heaviest particles kinematically accesible - shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs_bratios ] , which means that w and z bosons start to dominate for masses above 140  gev .",
    "this also implies that the width of the particle , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs_width ] , increases very rapidly in this region and become comparable to its mass above 500  gev .",
    "as the higgs production cross - section is very small compared to the expected qcd background , rare and clean signatures based on final states with weak bosons , photons and leptons constitute the main channels for discovery . in this context",
    ", the process @xmath1 , with the z s decaying into leptonic final states ( electrons and muons ) provides a clean signal with a narrow peak on top of a relatively smooth background .",
    "if the higgs mass is above 180  gev , this is the so called `` golden - channel '' , with two on - shell z - bosons .",
    "since all the decay products are reconstructed , and considering the excellent lepton energy resolution of the atlas detector , this channel can give a precise measurement of the higgs mass .",
    "for light higgs scenarios - below 200  gev , however , the width of the peak is dominated by the experimental resolution and no information can be extracted about the natural width of the particle .    the main background for this process is the non resonant @xmath2l , which has basically the same characteristics as the signal . in addition , any qcd process producing 4-lepton final states with significant transverse momenta ( @xmath3 ) must be considered .",
    "examples for such process are  and z  +  jets , in particular .",
    "processes with 3 leptons in the final state plus one `` fake lepton '' , like wz @xmath4l + x were found to give a negligible contribution to the search for the signal .",
    "the cross - sections of the processes mentioned , requiring 4-leptons within the detector acceptance ( transverse momentum above 5  gev and pseudo - rapidity @xmath5 within @xmath6 2.5 ) , are summarized in table  [ tab : xsec ] .",

    "the combination ensures very low fake rates , below the per - mille level , and can also increase the momentum resolution with respect to the inner detector measurement , mainly for @xmath3 above 50 gev .",

    "the analysis consists in finding evidence for the signal by triggering and selecting apropriate events , reducing the qcd background and reconstructing the higgs mass .",
    "triggers for high-@xmath3 leptons ( around 20 gev ) and di - leptons ( above 10 gev each ) are used , with an overall efficiency around 80% for single leptons above the threshold and greater than 95% for the h @xmath2l events .",
    "a cut - based analysis was performed , to bring the level of the reducible backgrounds ( in particular ) below one third of the zz level , as a protection against uncertainties on background yields .",
    "the events selected for the analysis were required to have at least 4 reconstructed leptons with @xmath7  gev and @xmath10 , as imposed in the event generation .",
    "additional requirements on the lepton reconstruction quality and tranverse momenta are applied , exploiting the fact that leptons from bottom decays have lower @xmath3 .",
    "the background is further reduced with cuts on the di - lepton invariant mass - a window around the z mass for one lepton - pair and a lower bound for the other , calorimeter and track isolation against qcd jets , and impact parameter ( ip ) - to remove leptons coming from a displaced vertex .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec_cutflow ] shows the cross - sections for signal and the main backgrounds after the application of each analysis cut .",
    "considering an instantaneous luminosity of @xmath11 , the effect of pile - up was investigated , including 2.3 events per bunch - crossing on lhc and thermalized slow neutrons and low energy photons escaping for the calorimeters .",
