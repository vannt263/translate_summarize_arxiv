    "nevertheless , in spite of the considerable effort devoted to this topic , there are still important aspects concerning the nature of gravitational fields in higher - dimensional gravity that remain open .",
    "any sufficiently general method which could be used to probe geometrical and physical properties of a given spacetime would be useful . in the present work we suggest and develop such an approach which is based on investigation and classification of specific effects of gravity encoded in relative motion of nearby test particles .",
    "in fact , in standard four - dimensional general relativity , this has long been used as an important tool for studies of spacetimes .",
    "relative motion of close free particles helps us to clarify the structure of a gravitational field in which the test particles move . when they have no charge and spin , this is mathematically described by the _ equation of geodesic deviation _",
    "( sometimes also called the jacobi equation ) which was first derived in the @xmath1-dimensional ( pseudo-)riemannian geometry by levi - civita and synge @xcite , see @xcite for the historical account .",
    "shortly after its application to einstein s gravity theory @xcite it helped , for instance , to understand the behaviour of test bodies influenced by gravitational waves or the physical fate of observers falling into black holes .",
    "textbook descriptions of this equation , which is linear with respect to the separation vector connecting the test particles , are given , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that generalizations of the equation of geodesic deviation to admit arbitrary relative velocities of the particles were obtained in the works @xcite .",

    "szekeres @xcite presented an elegant analysis of the behaviour of nearby test particles in a _",
    "generic _ four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "he demonstrated that the overall effect consists of specific transverse , longitudinal and newton  coulomb - type components .",
    "this was achieved by decomposing the riemann curvature tensor into the weyl tensor and the terms involving the ricci tensor ( and ricci scalar ) .",
    "while the former represents the `` free gravitational field '' the latter can be explicitly expressed , employing einstein s field equations , in terms of the corresponding components of the energy - momentum tensor which describes the matter content . in order to further analyze the weyl tensor contribution",
    ", szekeres used the formalism of self - dual bivectors @xcite constructed from _",
    "null frames_. this enabled him to deduce the effects of gravitational fields on nearby test particles in spacetimes of various petrov types . when these results are re - expressed in a more convenient newman ",
    "penrose formalism @xcite , explicit physical interpretation of the corresponding complex scalars @xmath2 are obtained . in particular",
    ", the weyl scalar @xmath3 ( the only non - trivial component in type  n spacetimes ) represents purely transverse effect of exact gravitational waves , the scalar @xmath4 ( present , e.g. , in type  iii spacetimes ) is responsible for longitudinal effects , and @xmath5 ( typical for spacetimes of type  d ) gives rise to newton - like deformations of the family of test particles ( see @xcite for more details ; inclusion of a nonvanishing cosmological constant was described in @xcite ) .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to extend these results to arbitrary spacetimes in _ any _ dimension @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we recall the equation of geodesic deviation , including its invariant form with respect to the interpretation orthonormal frame adapted to an observer . in section",
    "3 we perform the canonical decomposition of the curvature tensor using einstein s equations and the real weyl tensor components @xmath7 with respect to an associated null frame .",
    "we thus derive an explicit and general form of the equation of geodesic deviation .",
    "section  4 analyses the character of all canonical components of a gravitational field .",
    "section  5 is devoted to the discussion of uniqueness of the interpretation frame , and derivation of explicit relations which give the dependence of the field components on the observer s velocity . in section  6",
    "we describe the effect of pure radiation , perfect fluid and electromagnetic field on test particles .",
    "final section  7 illustrates the method on the family of pp - waves in higher dimensions .",
    "there are also 3 appendices : in appendix  a we give relations to the standard complex formalism of @xmath8 general relativity , and in appendix  b we summarize alternative notations commonly used in literature on @xmath6 spacetimes .",
    "finally , in appendix  c the lorentz transformations of the @xmath7 scalars are presented .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to investigate and characterize the curvature of an arbitrary spacetime of dimension @xmath9 by its local effects on freely falling test particles ( observers ) .",
    "the gravitational field manifests itself , in newtonian terminology , as specific `` tidal forces '' which cause the nearby particles to accelerate relative to each other .",
    "this leads to a deviation of corresponding geodesics whose separation thus changes with time : in various spatial directions the particles approach or recede from themselves , exhibiting thus the specific character of the spacetime in the vicinity of a given event .    in standard and also higher - dimensional general relativity , such a behaviour of free test particles ( without charge and spin )",
    "is described by the geodesic deviation equation @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 are components of the _ riemann curvature tensor _ , @xmath12 are components of the _ velocity vector",
    "_ @xmath13 of the reference ( fiducial ) particle moving along a timelike geodesic @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the parameter @xmath16 is its proper time ( so that @xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 are components of the _ separation vector _ @xmath19 which connects the reference particle with another nearby test particle moving along a timelike geodesic @xmath20 .",
    "the situation is visualized in figure  [ fig1 ] .     in a curved @xmath21-dimensional spacetime ,",
    "nearby test particles moving along geodesics accelerate toward or away from each other , as given by the equation of geodesic deviation . here",
    "@xmath22 is the velocity vector of a reference particle , and @xmath23 is the separation vector which represents actual relative position of the second test particle at a given proper time @xmath16 . ]",
    "equation explicitly expresses the relative acceleration of two nearby particles by the second absolute ( covariant ) derivative of the vector field @xmath23 along @xmath24 , @xmath25 in terms of the local curvature tensor and the actual relative position of the particles , described by the separation vector @xmath26 at the time @xmath16 .    to be geometrically more precise",
    ", the two geodesics should be understood as specific representatives of a congruence @xmath27 , i.e. smooth one - parameter family of geodesics , such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the proper time  @xmath16 and the parameter @xmath30 which labels the geodesics can be chosen as coordinates on the submanifold spanned by the congruence .",
    "thus @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the deviation vector field @xmath23 is lie - transported along the geodesics generated by @xmath22 .",
    "consider now the positions of two test particles at a given time , for example @xmath33 ( located at @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( for which @xmath36 , say ) at @xmath37 , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "their coordinates are related by the exponential map @xmath38 generated by @xmath39 at @xmath33 , where we set @xmath36 to locate @xmath35 .",
    "if the higher - order terms are negligible this expression reduces to @xmath40 , demonstrating that the separation vector @xmath23 describes the relative position of the two test particles , and @xmath26 gives its evolution that is obtained by solving the equation .",
    "such linear approximation improves when the second test particle moves very close to the reference one , i.e. along the geodesic @xmath41 , in which case the separation is described by the vector field @xmath42 .",
    "it should also be recalled that the equation of geodesic deviation is linear with respect to the components of the separation vector , neglecting higher - order terms in the taylor expansion of exact expression for relative acceleration of free test particles .",
    "it can thus be used when the relative velocities of the particles are negligible , i.e. their geodesics are almost parallel .",
    "generalizations of equation to admit arbitrary relative velocities were obtained and applied in the works @xcite .",
    "further extensions , higher - order corrections to the geodesic deviation equation and their specific applications can be found in @xcite ( for reviews and other references see @xcite ) .",
    "our aim , however , in this paper is to investigate local relative motion of nearby free test particles which are initially at rest with respect to each other .",
    "for such an analysis , the classical geodesic deviation equation will be fully sufficient .    now , in order to obtain _ invariant results _ independent of the choice of coordinates",
    ", it is natural to adopt the pirani approach @xcite based on the use of components of the above quantities with respect to a suitable _ orthonormal frame _ @xmath43 . at any point of the reference geodesic this defines an observer s framework in which physical measurements are made and interpreted . in particular , the separation vector is expressed as @xmath44 .",
    "the timelike vector of the frame is identified with the velocity vector of the observer , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , are perpendicular spacelike unit vectors which form its local cartesian basis in the hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath22 ( see also figure  [ fig2 ] ) , @xmath48 due to the fact that @xmath22 is parallelly transported , for the zeroth frame - component @xmath49 we immediately obtain @xmath50 using the skew - symmetry of the riemann tensor .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 must be at most a linear function of the proper time . by a natural choice of initial conditions , consistent with the above construction of the geodesic congruence @xmath27 , we set @xmath52",
    ". the temporal component of @xmath23 thus vanishes and the test particles always stay in the same spacelike hypersurfaces synchronized by  @xmath16 .",
    "physical information about relative motion of the test particles is thus completely contained in the spatial frame components @xmath53 of the separation vector  @xmath23 .",
    "these determine the actual _ relative spatial position _ of the two nearby particles . by projecting the geodesic deviation equation onto @xmath54",
    "we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and we denote the _ physical relative acceleration _ as @xmath57 the frame components of the riemann tensor are @xmath58 .",
    "let us note that pirani @xcite labeled , in @xmath8 , the frame components of the `` tidal stress tensor '' that occurs in equation ( with an opposite sign ) as @xmath59 .",
    "they are equivalent to the _ electric part _ of the riemann tensor @xmath60 , see @xcite .",
    "following pirani it is also usually assumed that the orthonormal frame @xmath43 is parallelly propagated along the reference geodesic .",
    "however , in our work we do not make such an assumption .",
    "in fact , as a key idea of the proposed interpretation method , we align the orthonormal frame with the _ algebraic structure _ of a given spacetime instead ( see also section  [ sc : framechoice ] ) .",
    "this makes the investigation of its physical properties much easier .",
    "next step is to express the frame components of the riemann tensor @xmath61 . using the standard decomposition of the curvature tensor into the traceless weyl tensor @xmath62 and specific combinations of the ricci tensor @xmath63 and ricci scalar @xmath64 , @xmath65b}-g_{b[c}\\,r_{d]a}\\right ) { { \\mbox{\\;,}\\relax}}\\nonumber\\\\    & & -\\frac{2}{(d-1)(d-2)}\\,r\\,g_{a[c}\\,g_{d]b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we",
