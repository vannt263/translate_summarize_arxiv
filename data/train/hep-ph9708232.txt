    "in a well - known paper@xcite isgur and wise derived extra consequences of the heavy mass of a particle in a restricted class of processes .",
    "their method was then quickly generalized@xcite and extended for use in various sectors of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the general class of processes dealt with in the latter references is with one `` heavy '' particle going in and moving through the whole process and going out again .",
    "everything else has low momenta compared to the heavy particle .",
    "the common point is that the number of `` heavy '' particles remains constant during the process due to a conserved quantum number .",
    "this is not the case in all processes where we expect this type of expansion to be useful .",
    "a simple but naive example would be the process in which intermediate state contains particles of even higher masses .",
    "those can be integrated out first and present no theoretical problem .",
    "we could , however , study the process @xmath4 in a theory with a light @xmath5-boson .",
    "then we would have to consider the charm quark intermediate state .",
    "the charm quark here has a large momentum and the process should be expressible as a power series in @xmath6 in an effective lagrangian where the @xmath7 quark always takes the large momentum .",
    "a similar problem arises when we try to do chiral perturbation theory for vector mesons . in reference",
    "@xcite was conjectured that a similar formalism should exist there .",
    "( see @xcite for other applications of this formalism ) .",
    "the main obstacle of dealing with this situation is that the methods used in@xcite  or e.g. @xcite for the extension to other spins do not take all terms correctly into account in performing the reduction from the full theory to the `` heavy '' effective one .    in order to estimate the parameters at higher order , in our previous calculation",
    "@xcite we performed the matching of the relativistic models with the `` heavy meson '' formulation in a diagrammatic fashion .",
    "the diagram by diagram formulation becomes difficult if we want to do the determination of all terms resulting from this reduction .",
    "in particular , chiral symmetry relates processes with different number of pions and it would therefore be useful to have a procedure that fully generates the correct terms immediately . for interactions among pions",
    "only when integrating out vector mesons this can be done using the equations of motion for the vector meson field@xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to show how this can be done for the `` heavy meson '' effective theory .",
    "the main complication is that we have to correctly treat the diagrams with only light intermediate states , one of which then has to carry high momentum , and at the same time the contributions from the heavy state to subprocesses involving light momenta only . for the `` light '' and `` heavy '' states in our theory we thus have to keep two possible momenta regimes .",
    "one around the mass - shell of the `` light '' mode and the other around the mass - shell of the `` heavy '' mode . in the usual cases",
    "only the momentum regime where all particles were close to their mass - shell is kept .",
    "keeping track of several momentum regions of the particles can in principle be done by introducing several components in the field , each of which has only a low momentum : @xmath8 notice that effective fields are traditionally normalized differently .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath9 .",
    "this factor should be understood in what follows .",
    "the component with the large ( small ) momentum we will refer to as the high ( low ) component in order not to confuse with light ( heavy ) for the mass .    we then integrate out for the heavy field the component @xmath10 and for the light field the component @xmath11 .",
    "this procedure works at tree level since there is always only one line carrying the heavy momentum through the whole diagram .",
    "we therefore also only need to keep at most two powers of the high components .",
    "the end result is then an effective theory formulated in terms of the high component of the heavy field and the low component of the light field . at any time , terms in the lagrangian which can not possibly conserve momentum do not contribute since they vanish after the integration over all space .",
    "the approach outlined above will obviously work in simple models . in the chiral models with vertices with any number of fields it becomes rather cumbersome .",
    "we will therefore choose a different method . by introducing a `` hidden '' symmetry we can introduce an extra spurious degree of freedom .",
    "the `` gauge fixing '' of this symmetry consists in choosing an equation for the extra degree of freedom in such a way that the spurious degree of freedom takes care of the far off - shell components of the fields .",
    "we will present the main idea in three stages .",
    "first we show it in a simple model where this approach is identical to the one in eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) but shows the procedure in a simple way . then we show the procedure in a model with an external scalar field coupling to pions in a chirally invariant way .",
    "finally we present the case for vector mesons interacting with pions . here",
    "we rederive and generalize the results of @xcite .",
    "we also show in a few examples that the `` heavy '' meson method works at the one  loop level and present a short discussion of the relevance of the width .",
    "consider the following lagrangian with a heavy @xmath12 field and a light @xmath13 field : @xmath14 we will be interested in the limit , in which the @xmath12 mesons gets very heavy , that is , @xmath15 .",
    "we will consider that @xmath16 in this limit is a non - vanishing finite constant .",
    "the `` heavy '' meson theory ( hmt ) now looks at processes of the type @xmath17 with the @xmath12 on - shell and the momenta of the pions small compared to the @xmath12-mass @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 processes are relevant as well , they occur as subprocesses in ( [ processes ] ) .",
    "an important point is to notice that processes such as a decay of a @xmath20 into two @xmath13 s , allowed by ( [ model ] ) , do not lie within the heavy meson theory .",
    "the vertex @xmath21 can , however , generate green functions that lie within the hmt . in figure [ figgreen]c , for example , we have combined four of these vertices to construct a six  point function that is described within the hmt .",
    "this green function can not be generated in the same way in the heavy meson theory , and we will see how the hmt - vertices that accounts for the green function can be generated .    the naive limit to the heavy meson theory would be to just write @xmath22 and restrict @xmath23 and @xmath13 to momenta much smaller than @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is a four - velocity as introduced in @xcite , @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 this naive procedure would lead to a lagrangian without interaction terms , an obviously wrong conclusion .",
    "the method where we also keep the particular far off - shell regions relevant for the processes of eq .",
    "( [ processes ] ) as in eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) can be used here and gives the same results as a diagram by diagram matching .    a different way",
    "to achieve the same result is introducing first two extra symmetries @xmath28 with the extra fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the symmetry transformations are with @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath33 the lagrangian , @xmath34 is equivalent to @xmath27 and has the extra symmetry .",
    "we can simply return to @xmath27 by choosing @xmath35 .",
    "we use the freedom of gauge to have @xmath30 take care of the low part of @xmath12 and @xmath29 of the high part of @xmath13 .",
    "we choose : @xmath36 here it should be understood that inside the @xmath37 term only the `` low momentum part '' is taken , ( i.e. the term behaving like : @xmath38 , see below ) .",
    "this choice now allows us to make the _ consistent _ set of approximations : @xmath39 this is consistent since the equations of motion are now such that all terms in the equations that contribute to the processes ( [ processes ] ) are correctly taken care of .",
    "the problem before was that , if we used eq .",
    "( [ naive ] ) only , there were `` driving '' terms in the equations that had the wrong momentum .",
    "] that had nowhere to go .",
    "the choice of gauge for the spurious fields of ( [ choice ] ) solves this problem .",
    "all the tilded fields in ( [ consistent ] ) are `` low momentum fields '' , that is , their fourier transforms are only non - vanishing for momenta @xmath40 .",
    "it is this fact that will allow us to perform a consistent and well defined expansion in @xmath41 .",
    "the `` heavy '' lagrangian should only depend on the fields close to their mass  shell .",
    "we therefore integrate out @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . at tree level , this can be done by choosing the gauge and replacing the solution in the lagrangian .",
    "we have solved ( [ choice ] ) by performing an expansion in @xmath45 . up to order @xmath46 , we find : @xmath47 to go to the nonrelativistic limit , we introduce the correct normalization , @xmath48 replacing ( [ consistent ] ) , ( [ sol1om ] ) and ( [ nrphi ] ) in ( [ l1 ] ) , and expanding up to order @xmath49 , we find : @xmath50   +   { \\lambda ^2 \\over m^2 } \\bigg ( -{1\\over 2 } \\tilde \\pi ^2 \\box \\tilde \\pi ^2 + { 1\\over m } \\bigg\\{4   \\lambda ^2 \\tilde \\pi ^4 \\bar \\phi   \\bar \\phi ^\\dagger \\nonumber \\\\   & - & ( \\tilde \\pi \\bar \\phi \\box ( \\tilde \\pi \\bar \\phi ^\\dagger ) + \\tilde \\pi \\bar \\phi ^\\dagger   \\box ( \\tilde \\pi \\bar \\phi ) ) + % 4 [ \\tilde \\pi \\bar \\phi ( v\\cdot \\partial)^2   ( \\tilde \\pi \\bar \\phi ^\\dagger ) + \\tilde \\pi \\bar \\phi ^\\dagger   ( v\\cdot \\partial)^2 ( \\tilde \\pi \\bar \\phi ) ]   \\bigg\\ }",
    "\\bigg ) \\label{eflagm2 } % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ eflagm2 ] ) we have kept terms which apparently are of order @xmath51 .",
    "the reason is that for green functions involving @xmath52 , an extra factor @xmath53 has to be introduced , ( [ nrphi ] ) .",
    "clearly , we have generated hmt vertices for the green functions discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "two four  point vertices are not suppressed in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , they are the only non - suppressed green functions in this limit . the four pion function has been obtained by integrating out the _ low _ component , @xmath42 , of the _ heavy _ particle , @xmath12 .",
    "this is the same attitude followed for example in @xcite , where the vector mesons where integrated out to obtain their contributions to the pseudo - scalar interactions at low - energy .",
    "the other four  point green function , @xmath54 , has been obtained by integrating out the _ high _ components , @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the _ light _",
    "particle , the @xmath13 . to our knowledge , this procedure was used for the first time in@xcite , there we used a diagrammatic approach .",
    "we also find a six point function .",
    "it is suppressed by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "we have checked that the four and six point functions generated by ( [ eflagm2 ] ) reproduce exactly , up to order @xmath58 the corresponding green functions of the full relativistic theory , ( [ model ] ) .",
    "let us have a closer look at the situation of the six point functions in general , see fig .",
    "[ figgreen ] .",
    "the first three diagrams , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are diagrams in the full theory , ( [ model ] ) , while diagram @xmath61 and @xmath62 live in the effective theory .",
    "cutting the internal heavy meson of diagram @xmath63 , we obtain two four point functions that lie within the hmt .",
    "the hmt can describe these two four  point functions , ( [ eflagm2 ] ) .",
    "the hmt counterpart for diagram @xmath63 is diagram @xmath64 .",
    "the situation is very similar for diagram @xmath7 : here , we again obtain two four point functions that are described within the hmt by cutting one of the internal pion line .",
    "the fact that one of these is a four pion function shows why at the beginning of the section we claimed the processes @xmath65 also have to be taken into account .",
    "the hmt counterpart of @xmath7 is @xmath66 .",
    "the situation is however different for diagram @xmath60 . here",
    "no hmt diagram can be generated by cutting any of the internal lines . in the hmt",
    ", we can not construct its counterpart from `` smaller '' diagrams .",
    "a new vertex , the six point vertex in ( [ eflagm2 ] ) has been generated to account for it .",
    "the hmt counterpart for @xmath60 is @xmath62 .",
    "this can be generalized , and if we continue our expansions of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , ( [ sol1om ] ) and @xmath67 , ( [ eflagm2 ] ) to higher orders in @xmath68 , we would generate new eight , ten , and higher order vertices .",
    "we will now illustrate with a few examples that the effective lagrangian we have constructed in the previous section , which does reproduce correctly the tree level green functions of the full relativistic theory , also reproduces correctly the non - analytic parts of the green functions at the one loop level .",
    "the first non - trivial results in that model show up in four  point functions .",
    "we add a pion mass and a coupling of pions to an external scalar field @xmath69 to the model .",
    "then we have nontrivial behaviour already in two and three  point functions .",
    "the lagrangian becomes @xmath70    the first example will be the one  loop self - energy of the @xmath12 , at leading order in @xmath45 . in the effective theory ( hmt ) , its contribution is given by @xmath71 where we have followed the standard notation and used dimensional regularization with @xmath72 and @xmath73 is euler s constant .",
    "it is also easy to obtain the result in the full relativistic theory : @xmath74 let us make a few observations here :    1 .",
    "the nonanalytic terms we are interested in are the logarithms of @xmath75 .",
    "it follows from ( [ phiselfeff ] ) and ( [ phiselffull ] ) that the effective theory does reproduce this .",
    "this is the main point .",
    "2 .   the analytic dependence on @xmath75 gets a correction at one  loop compared to the tree ",
    "level one .",
    "this correction is even infinite in the @xmath76 limit .",
    "this dependence can not be obtained from the hmt .",
    "we have to leave a term proportional to @xmath75 for the @xmath12 mass in the hmt .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the full theory , @xmath77 has an imaginary part , which is absent in the effective theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the full theory the @xmath12 has a finite width due to the decay @xmath78 .",
    "since this decay can not be described within the heavy meson theory , no imaginary part is present in @xmath79 .",
    "a small discussion about this fact can be found in sect .",

    "we can again make the same three remarks made above :    1 .",
    "the nonanalytic term in @xmath96 and @xmath82 are exactly the same as in the integral of ( [ efmatching ] ) .",
    "the argument of the logarithm is @xmath97 . to obtain @xmath98 we have to add a term proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "this term requires us to introduce a direct @xmath100 coupling in the hmt to obtain matching .",
    "the imaginary part only coincides provided the part corresponding to the @xmath12 width can be neglected .",
    "it is equal to @xmath101 .",
    "the second term is the imaginary part due to the @xmath12-width and the first part is the long  distance part present in the effective theory ( [ efmatching ] ) .",
    "the qcd lagrangian has an approximate chiral symmetry @xmath102 for @xmath103 light flavours .",
    "this implies the existence of light pseudo - goldstone bosons , which we will refer to as pions .",
    "the method of dealing with these at low energy is chiral perturbation theory@xcite . in ( [ model ] )",
    "there were only vertices with a limited number of legs .",
    "effective lagrangians with pions tend to have vertices with any number of legs .",
    "the method illustrated on the simple example becomes much more powerful here . in this section",
    "we will introduce a pion lagrangian coupling to an external scalar source @xmath69 and we will show how to obtain an effective lagrangian with terms bilinear in @xmath69 to reproduce all green functions of the type @xmath104 with @xmath105 a large momentum and @xmath106 and the @xmath13-momenta small . again we will restrict our discussion to tree level .    consider the following lagrangian : @xmath107 here we used the following notation @xmath108 and @xmath109 denotes the trace of @xmath110 .",

    "we now set @xmath121 where @xmath122 only has momenta small compared to @xmath24 and look at green functions with one insertion of @xmath122 and one of @xmath123 .",
    "these have contributions with pions of momenta of order @xmath24 .",
    "we treat these pions in the same way as in the previous section by introducing a spurious field that takes its role .",
    "the difficulty here is to do it in a manifestly chirally invariant fashion .",
    "this can be done by introducing a `` hidden '' @xmath124 symmetry that is rather nonlinearly realized .",

    "the presence of terms involving @xmath182 in ( [ veceff ] ) makes this last step a little bit more subtle , and we can not simply replace ( [ effectw ] ) in ( [ veceff ] ) . we will follow the method of section 4 of @xcite and introduce a parallel component , @xmath183 , and a perpendicular component @xmath184 , and integrate the parallel component out , see @xcite for details . to leading order in @xmath45 , and in the notation of @xcite ( eq.(13 ) of that paper ) , this leads to @xmath185 we have checked that these terms can be reproduced _",

    "( [ newas ] ) agrees with @xcite after correcting the misprints there .    in this section",
    "we have used model iii of @xcite , but similar methods can be applied to the other models .",
    "we have checked that all three models predict the same @xmath193 \\rangle$ ] term , ( coming from the integration out of the high component of the pions ) which contributes to the masses in @xcite , but different @xmath194 [ w^\\mu , w ^\\nu ] \\rangle$ ] terms , ( integration out of the low components of the vectors ) which do not contribute to the masses in @xcite .",
    "the coefficient we find for this term in model iii is @xmath195 , while in model ii we find @xmath196 .",
    "the fact that different models predict different @xmath197 lagrangians should not be surprising , since @xmath198 and @xmath199 in @xcite differ by terms of order @xmath197 .",
    "contributions to the vector masses in the relativistic and the heavy meson formulation are given by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figtoy ] with the crosses removed .",
    "we introduce here a pion mass term , @xmath200 , to have relevant nonanalytic contributions and only consider the pion contributions . in the effective formulation",
    "we obtain a contribution to the @xmath201 mass - shift @xmath202 in the relativistic formulation we obtain @xmath203 with @xmath204 we can now check by expanding @xmath205 that the first nonanalytic dependence on @xmath75 only appears at order @xmath206 and that the coefficients agree if we use the value of @xmath175 used above .",
    "so here we have an indication that the procedure of the heavy meson theory also works in this case at one loop .",
    "the width of the `` heavy '' particle due to its decays is not included in the hmt . here",
    "we discuss shortly under what circumstances we expect the hmt to be useful given that it can not easily describe the width . in the tree level processes in the relativistic theory",
    "we can describe the width of the heavy particle by using as propagator instead @xmath207 here we see that if the typical off - shellness of the `` heavy '' particle is large compared to its width the latter can be neglected . for vector mesons at tree  level this will always be the case except for the @xmath201 .",
    "but even there we are helped by the extra factor of two in the expansion in ( [ propagator ] ) .    in the loop",
    "diagrams a similar argument will hold if the contributions of the integrals very near to the mass - shell is small compared to the others . again for vector mesons we expect this to be the case except possibly for the @xmath201 . even for the @xmath201 ,",
    "the dependence on the strange quark mass and similar effects come from intermediate states that are far off - shell so those should be reliably estimated in the hmt .",
    "the problem of reducing a relativistic theory to a `` heavy '' effective formulation restricted to a particular type of processes has been solved in the case where the number of `` heavy '' particles is not conserved .",
    "the problem of `` high '' components of light particles and `` low '' components of heavy particles has been treated in a natural way .",
    "we have enlarged the symmetry by a `` hidden '' symmetry .",
    "the spurious degrees of freedom thus introduced , can be chosen by a particular choice of `` gauge '' for the extra symmetry to play the role of the `` high '' components of the light particle and of the `` low '' components of the heavy particle .",
    "the choice of gauge allows then for a simple reduction to the `` heavy '' effective theory .",
    "we explicitly matched all relevant green functions at tree level , first in a toy model and afterwards in two chiral models , showing that matching already at this level is rather subtle .",
    "in the last two examples our method allows to have chiral symmetry explicit during all stages of the calculation . the calculation for the model for the vector mesons agrees with our previous matching procedure@xcite which was done by matching specific green functions .",
    "we have shown that with this procedure the non - analytical parts at one - loop level are also recovered in a few examples .",
    "we included both a two and a three  point function in the simple model and a two  point function in the vector chiral case .",
    "these examples provide support that the `` heavy '' meson theory will also be correct at the quantum level .",
