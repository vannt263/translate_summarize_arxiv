    "the field of quantum chaos  @xcite focuses on the quantum manifestations of classical chaos .",
    "signatures of chaoticity were observed in the statistical properties of the eigenvalues and the wave functions of the corresponding quantum system  @xcite , in the fluctuation properties of the scattering matrix elements of chaotic scattering processes  @xcite , in the transport properties of quantum dots  @xcite and also in systems , where time - reversal invariance is broken , e.g. , by a magnetic field  @xcite . for a generic quantum system with classically regular dynamics the spectral properties",
    "were predicted to coincide with those of poissonian random numbers  @xcite , whereas according to the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture  @xcite the spectral properties of chaotic systems are well described by random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite .",
    "these predictions have been confirmed in a huge amount of experimental , numerical and theoretical studies by now . in the present article we focus on long - range correlations of the spectral fluctuations in non - chaotic systems . for this",
    "we used a procedure which is based on methods from time series analysis  @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "the @xmath0 statistic , defined as the deviation between the spacing of two unfolded levels separated by @xmath1 levels and their mean @xmath2 , is viewed as a time series with the index @xmath2 taking the role of time .",
    "its power spectrum @xmath3 , obtained as the modulus square of its fourier transform from @xmath2 to @xmath4 space , exhibits for small @xmath4 a power law @xmath5 , which allows to distinguish between a chaotic ( @xmath6 ) and an integrable ( @xmath7 ) classical dynamics .",
    "the full functional forms of the power spectrum were derived for the rmt ensembles and poisson statistics in ref.@xcite . the analytical result for time - reversal invariant chaotic systems , the spectral properties of which",
    "are expected to coincide with those of the eigenvalues of random matrices from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , were verified using a microwave cavity with the shape of a sinai billiard  @xcite .",
    "generally , billiards provide appropriate systems for the study of problems within the field of quantum chaos , because the degree of chaoticity of their classical dynamics only depends on their shape  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum billiards have the particular property that their eigenvalues and wave functions can be obtained experimentally by using flat , cylindrical microwave resonators  @xcite .",
    "indeed , below a certain frequency @xmath8 with @xmath9 the velocity of light and @xmath10 the height of the resonator , the electrical field is perpendicular to the top and the bottom plate of the resonator and is governed by a two - dimensional helmholtz equation with dirichlet boundary conditions at the side walls of the resonator . accordingly , in this frequency range of transversal - magnetic tm@xmath11 modes it is mathematically equivalent to the schrdinger equation of a quantum billiard of corresponding shape . therefore ,",
    "such resonators are referred to as microwave billiards .",
    "it is worth pointing out that microwave networks which simulate quantum graphs  @xcite provide another suitable system for theoretical and experimental studies of problems within the field of quantum chaos .",
    "we report on the investigation of long - range correlations of the spectral fluctuations in terms of power spectra in microwave billiards simulating singular billiards  @xcite , that is , quantum billiards which contain a point - like ( zero - range ) perturbations .",
    "in fact , microwave power is coupled into and out of the resonator via wire antennas  @xcite , and these act as singular scatterers .",
    "the cavities used in our experiments where rectangular .",
    "such systems offer the simplest realization of a singular billiard , because the eigenvalues and the wave functions of the corresponding quantum billiard are known explicitly . there",
    ", indeed exist several experimental and theoretical studies on their spectral properties  @xcite .",
    "these works restrict to the investigation of the distribution of the spacings of adjacent energy levels , i.e. , of short - range correlations .",
    "already the very first experiments  @xcite revealed deviations of the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) from the poissonian one , expected for integrable systems , which instead was of intermediate type  @xcite . for small spacings the nnsd vanished , i.e. , exhibited level - repulsion typical for chaotic systems , whereas it decreased exponentially like the poissonian level - spacing distribution for large spacings .",
    "these features of the nnsd were attributed to the presence of the antennas which act as singular perturbations . yet , at first , these findings were surprising , because the classical dynamics of singular billiards is not chaotic .",
    "in classical mechanics point - like perturbations affect only those trajectories that hit them , and these are of measure zero .",
    "in contrast to the features , in quantum mechanics even small - size perturbations change the spectral properties of such non - chaotic systems .",
    "note , however , that the spectral properties of billiards with a chaotic classical dynamics are not affected by the addition of singular perturbations .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the two - point correlation function and the nnsd of integrable billiards with a @xmath12-function potential exhibiting a singular spectral statistics were derived . in ref .",
    "@xcite the microwave billiard with the attached antennas was regarded as a scattering system .",
    "this idea was readopted in refs .",
    "@xcite and a rigorous equation for the computation of the energy levels was derived , applicable to microwave billiards with the shape of a classically integrable billiard .",
    "the objective of the present article is the investigation of long - range correlations , such as the dyson - mehta statistic and power spectra of systems exhibiting singular statistics . in   the experiment",
    "is described and the experimental results are presented .",
    "based on the porter - rosenzweig model  @xcite we determine the chaoticity parameter in   and , finally , in   we compare the experimental results for the spectral properties to those of the eigenvalues of singular billiards . for this purpose , we computed the latter using the method described in ref .",
    "we will demonstrate , that with increasing microwave frequency the spectral properties of the microwave billiards approach semi - poisson statistics  @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed with a rectangular microwave billiard , a schematic view of which is shown in  .",
    "the cavity was manufactured from brass and its height was @xmath13  mm corresponding to @xmath14  ghz .",
    "the measurements were performed up to @xmath15  ghz , in order to ensure the equivalence of the associated helmholtz equation and the schrdinger equation of the corresponding quantum billiard .",
    "the shorter side length l@xmath16 of the microwave billiard was kept fixed at @xmath17  cm , whereas the longer one , l@xmath18 , was changed as indicated in  , taking 5 values between @xmath19  cm to @xmath20  cm differing by @xmath21  cm .",
    "two microwave antennas were introduced into the cavity at two of the positions marked by a@xmath18 , a@xmath16 , a@xmath22 and a@xmath23 in  , for the measurements . with respect to the lower left corner",
    "they are located at @xmath24  cm , @xmath25  cm , @xmath26  cm and @xmath27  cm , respectively .",
    "the diameter of the wire was @xmath28  mm and it penetrated @xmath29  mm into the cavity .",
    "the resonance frequencies were obtained from transmission and reflection measurements . for this ,",
    "microwave power was coupled into the resonator via one of the antennas and coupled out via the second or the same one by a vector network analyzer ( agilent e8364b ) which was connected to the antennas through flexible microwave cables ( hp 85133 - 616 ) .",
    "a part of the transmission measurement with the antennas attached to the cavity at a@xmath18 and a@xmath22 is presented in   in the frequency range from @xmath30  ghz to @xmath31  ghz .",
    "it exhibits overlapping resonances , which hampered the determination of the resonance frequencies .",
    "the broadening of the resonances is mainly due to ohmic absorption in the walls of the cavity .",
    "actually , the quality factor @xmath32 ranged between @xmath33 . in order to decide whether a hump in a broad resonance corresponds to a genuine eigenvalue we ( i ) plotted for each antenna combination the level sequences determined for the 5 configurations versus the discrete parameter values given by the lengths @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , yielding a gapless level dynamics  @xcite if no levels are missing , ( ii ) compared the reflection and transmission measurements for a given configuration , ( iii ) plotted the fluctuating part of the integrated level density @xmath35 , that is , the difference of the number of identified resonance frequencies @xmath36 below @xmath37 with @xmath38 and the number predicted by weyl s formula  @xcite for microwave billiards , versus @xmath39 . in particular this quantity provides a tool which is extremely sensitive to a missing or a spurious eigenvalue , because it exhibits jumps at such frequencies .",
    "note that , if the electric field vanishes at the position of an antenna at a certain resonance frequency , then neither a resonance is excited nor a hump shows up at this frequency in the corresponding spectrum , resulting in a missing eigenvalue .",
    "while in the lowest frequency range , the six resulting sets of resonance frequencies are barely distinguishable , this is no longer the case in the upper frequency range , where the influence of the antennas becomes particularly perceptible , e.g. , in the spectral properties .",
    "this aspect , actually , will be the subject of  .",
    "furthermore , the distance between the paremeters was sufficiently large , to ensure that the associated level sequences could be considered as independent , however , small enough so that we could identify missing levels as described above .",
    "accordingly , in the lowest frequency range we had five independent level sequences , whereas in the upper freqency ranges the six combinations of antenna positions and the five parameters yielded 30 sets of independent level sequences .",
    "prior to the analysis of the spectral statistics , system specific properties , that is , the smooth modulations of the level density , need to be removed .",
    "we carried out this unfolding by replacing the resonance frequencies @xmath37 by the smooth part of the integrated level density , which is given by weyl s formula , @xmath40 weyl s formula  @xcite corresponds to a quadratic polynomial , which depends on the area , the perimeter and the curvature of the billiard .",
    "on the one hand we used weyl s formula for the unfolding , on the other hand , @xmath41 was determined by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the experimentally determined integrated resonance density .",
    "both procedures yielded the same results for the spectral properties .",
    "this yields dimensionless eigenvalues @xmath42 with mean value unity , @xmath43 , of the spacings @xmath44 between adjacent levels .",
    "we investigated the spectral properties of the unfolded resonance frequencies in terms of the nnsd @xmath45 , the dyson - mehta statistic @xmath46 and the power spectrum @xmath47 .",
    "while the nnsd gives information on short - range correlations , the @xmath48 statistic corresponds to a measure for the long - range correlations .",
    "the @xmath48 statistic is defined as the least - squares deviation of the integrated resonance density of the unfolded eigenvalues from the straight line best fitting it in the interval @xmath49 and provides a measure for the degree of rigidity of a level sequence .",
    "another measure for long - range correlations is the @xmath0 statistic , @xmath50 which gives the deviation of the spacing between two unfolded levels separated by @xmath1 levels from its mean @xmath2 . considering the index @xmath2 as the analogue of a discrete time",
    ", the power spectrum is obtained as the modulus square of the fourier transform from time to @xmath4 space  @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fourier transform of @xmath0 , @xmath53    the analytical results for the nnsd and the dyson - mehta statistic are given by  @xcite @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "here , @xmath56 is euler s constant .",
    "the quoted goe results are approximations which , however , have been shown to describe the spectral properties of the eigenvalues of random matrices from the goe very well  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite analytical expressions where derived on the basis of rmt for the gaussian ensembles and for poissonian random numbers , yielding @xmath57\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{4\\sin^2(\\pi k / n ) } + \\delta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath58 for the gaussian ensembles and @xmath59 for poisson sequences and @xmath60 is the spectral form factor , @xmath61 note , that in eq .",
    "( [ analytical ] ) the variable @xmath62 takes values between @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    "the average power spectrum approaches a power - law behavior @xmath65 which can be summarized as follows , @xmath66 thus , already the asymptotic features of @xmath67 for @xmath68 provide information on the chaoticity of the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "we realized that the spectral fluctuation properties of the experimental resonance frequencies varied smoothly with increasing frequency . therefore , we investigated them for each of the 30 data sets in three frequency ranges , namely in the intervals [ 3.8,8.0 ]  ghz , [ 8.0,11.3 ]  ghz and [ 13.5,16.7 ]  ghz , corresponding to @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 resonance frequencies , respectively .",
    "the intervals were chosen such that the spectral properties were approximately the same over their whole range .",
    "the statistical measures were determined for each set separately and then averaged over the ensemble .",
    "for the calculation of the @xmath48 statistic we proceeded as described in  @xcite .",
    "in   we present the thus obtained results for the nnsd ( red [ gray ] histograms in the upper panels ) , the @xmath48 statistic ( red [ gray ] circles in the middle panels ) and the power spectrum ( red [ gray ] dots in the lower panels ) .",
    "they are compared to the corresponding poisson and the goe results , shown as full and dashed lines , respectively . in all frequency intervals",
    "the spectral properties clearly differ from poisson , which is expected to describe the properties of billiards with integrable classical dynamics like rectangular billiards .",
    "we performed numerical calculations in order to ensure , that these deviations can not be attributed to the fact that the ratios of the side lengths l@xmath18 and l@xmath16 of the microwave billiards used in the experiments were no irrational numbers  @xcite .    the agreement with poisson becomes worse with increasing frequency . at @xmath72",
    "the nnsd has a dip for all frequency ranges and is vanishingly small for the uppermost interval .",
    "thus it exhibits there the same features as generic chaotic systems . for large spacings , on the other hand , the nnsds decrease exponentially like the poissonian one . also the @xmath48 statistic and the power spectra",
    "neither agree with that for poisson statistic nor with that for the goe in all frequency intervals and seem to approach the corresponding goe curve with increasing frequency .",
    "we determined the power - law behavior @xmath65 illustrated in a log - log plot in   and found that @xmath73 in the lower frequency range , @xmath74 in the middle one and @xmath75 in the upper interval .",
    "these values are close to @xmath76 , expected for poissonian random numbers ; see eq .",
    "( [ asymptotic ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the smallest value of @xmath77 achieved in the experiments was @xmath78 .",
    "this prohibited the determination of @xmath79 in the effectively asymptotic region .",
    "still these results indicate , that the fluctuation properties of the resonance frequencies of the microwave billiard exhibit a statistic intermediate between poisson and goe , thereby confirming previous findings  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the following section is to quantify the deviation of the spectral properties from regularity in terms of a chaoticity parameter .",
    "in order to estimate the size of the deviation of the spectral properties from those of poissonian random numbers we applied the random - matrix model by porter - rosenzweig  @xcite , which depends on a parameter @xmath80 and interpolates between poisson for @xmath81 and goe for @xmath82 , with @xmath83 denoting the dimension of the random matrices @xmath84 with matrix elements @xmath85,\\ , i , j=1, .... ,n.\\ ] ] here , the quantities @xmath86 denote the entries of a real symmetric matrix from the goe .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 is defined in such a way , that it does not depend on the dimension @xmath83 of @xmath84 . in order to verify this",
    ", we generated for various values of @xmath80 ensembles of 500 random matrices with dimensions @xmath87 , and computed the nnsd , the @xmath48 statistic and the power spectra .",
    "then we determined the values of @xmath80 corresponding to the three frequency intervals by comparing the rmt and the experimental results for the statistical measures and by computing the corresponding mean square deviations , yielding @xmath88 in the frequency range [ 3.8,8.0 ]  ghz , @xmath89 for [ 8.0,11.3 ]  ghz and @xmath90 for [ 13.5,16.7 ]  ghz .",
    "these values are in line with our observation that the statistical measures deviate more and more from poisson with increasing frequency . in",
    "we show the experimental curves together with those obtained on the basis of the porter - rosenzweig model .    especially in the uppermost frequency interval",
    ", the agreement between the experimental nnsd and the rmt result seems to be very good .",
    "however , the porter - rosenzweig model fails to reproduce the experimental long - range correlations , as illustrated for the @xmath48 statistic and the power spectra shown in the middle and the lower panels of  .",
    "similar observations were made for the nnsd in ref .",
    "accordingly , we basically determined the values of @xmath80 from the nnsd",
    ". nevertheless , the parameter @xmath80 provides a suitable measure for the size of the deviations of the spectral statistic from poisson .",
    "the deviations of the spectral properties of the microwave billiards from the expected poissonian statistics are attributed to the presence of the antennas .",
    "thin wire antennas can be described as two - dimensional dipoles ( line sources ) with a frequency dependent coupling to the resonator  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding helmholtz equation is mathematically equivalent to the schrdinger equation of a singular quantum billiard  @xcite , @xmath91\\psi(\\boldsymbol{x } ) = k^2\\psi(\\boldsymbol{x}),\\ ] ] where @xmath92 denotes the position of the antenna and the wave function @xmath93 has to fulfill the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the coupling parameter @xmath94 varies slowly with frequency .",
    "this is in accordance with our findings , obtained by varying the lengths and the positions of the frequency intervals used for the analysis of the spectral properties , and allowed us to investigate the spectral properties in frequency intervals containing at least 150 resonance frequencies . in refs .",
    "@xcite the two - point correlation function and the nnsd of the eigenvalues of this equation were derived for a fixed @xmath94 and shown to exhibit a singular statistics intermediate between poisson and goe .",
    "this approach is applicable to closed singular billiards .",
    "microwave billiards , however , are open systems with the antennas acting as scattering channels . in ref .",
    "@xcite a model was developed which is applicable to such situations .",
    "the microwave billiard was regarded as a scattering system and the antennas as point - like scatterers and the computation of the eigenvalues was reduced to the calculation of the associated renormalized green s function .",
    "this yielded an explicit eigenvalue equation for singular billiards with rectangular shape , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the eigenvalues and wave functions of the unperturbed rectangular billiard , and @xmath98 is a constant .",
    "this equation depends only on one parameter , @xmath99 , which can be interpreted as the scattering length of the perturbation  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation is week for @xmath100 and increases with decreasing @xmath101 .",
    "we determined 20000 eigenvalues of the unperturbed rectangular billiards for all geometries considered in the experiment and solved the eigenvalue problem eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalues ] ) for each antenna position @xmath92 ( see  ) for several values of @xmath99 .",
    "then we compared the spectral properties for the different realizations with the experimental ones and computed the corresponding mean square deviations , in order to determine the value of @xmath99 for which the model best describes the experimental results , yielding @xmath102 for the frequency range [ 0.1,8.0 ]  ghz , @xmath103 for [ 8.0,11.3 ]  ghz and @xmath104 for the interval [ 13.5,16.7 ]  ghz . for the analysis of the spectral properties we only took into account the perturbed eigenvalues , for which @xmath105 was nonzero .",
    "note , that the unperturbed wave functions correspond to a vanishing electric field strength at the position of the antenna and , thus , the corresponding resonance frequencies are missing in the experimental eigenvalue list .",
    "furthermore , we used a similar number of eigenvalues as was found in the respective frequency interval .",
    "in   we compare the experimental results with the numerical ones , obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalues ] ) ( green curves in the upper and the lower panels , crosses in the middle ones ) .",
    "the agreement is very good for all three statistical measures .",
    "both results are compared to semi - poisson statistics ( dashed line ) , where the nnsd and the @xmath48 statistic are given by  @xcite @xmath106 and @xmath107 + o\\left(\\frac{1}{l}\\right),\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the result for the power spectrum is obtained by inserting the form factor  @xcite @xmath108 and @xmath109 into eq .",
    "( [ analytical ] ) . for small values of @xmath77",
    "the power spectrum exhibits a power - law behavior @xmath65 with @xmath110 in the experimental range of @xmath4 values ( see  ) .",
    "this values is close to the experimental ones .",
    "the agreement of the experimental and the numerical results with semi - poisson is striking in the uppermost frequency range . in the middle panels , showing the @xmath48 statistic , all three curves actually lie on top of each other . a similar agreement with semi - poisson",
    "was found numerically for the nnsd in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the spectral properties of the rectangular microwave billiards are well described by the model for billiards containing zero - range perturbations .",
    "finally , we should note that the spectral statistics of the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalues ] ) changes towards poisson for high energies @xmath111 , i.e. , far beyond the experimentally achievable values . here , the value of @xmath112 depends on the scattering length @xmath99 , that is , the coupling parameter @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ singular_eigenvalues ] ) .",
    "we investigated the short- and long - range correlations of the spectral fluctuation properties of rectangular microwave billiards , which contain antennas that act as point - like perturbations and showed that they exhibit singular statistics .",
    "thus , such systems can be used to model the features of singular quantum billiards .",
    "the experimental data indeed are well described by a model applicable to singular rectangular billiards , i.e. , to billiards containing zero - range perturbations  @xcite .",
    "we observe a transition from poisson statistics towards semi - poisson with increasing frequency . indeed , in the uppermost frequency range achieved in the experiments ,",
    "the spectral properties are surprisingly well described by semi - poisson statistics . in order to corroborate these observations",
    ", we did not only consider the nnsd , as had been done before , but also studied long - range correlations such as the @xmath48 statistic and the @xmath0 statistic , or rather its fourier transform , the power spectrum . in  @xcite deviations of the elastic enhancement factor computed on the basis of transmission and reflection measurements in the frequency range [ 16,18.5 ]  ghz with rectangular microwave billiards , from the predictions for integrable systems",
    "were found which may be explained by these results .",
    "we , in fact , may conclude , that these spectra instead are suitable for the study of the enhancement factor of systems exhibiting singular statistics .",
    "this aspect will be pursued in a future work .",
    "finally , we may conclude that in order to obtain a statistics close to poisson , i.e. , @xmath114 for the fluctuations in the spectra of microwave billiards with classically integrable dynamics , the lengths of the antennas need to be minimized .",
    "this will result in small excitations of the resonance modes , and thus small amplitudes in the corresponding transmission and reflection measurements .",
    "then , however , the identification of the resonance positions , and thus the determination of the eigenvalues , will become even more cumbersome if not impossible , yielding incomplete spectra .",
    "strictly speaking , due to the presence of the antennas the realization of poisson statistics is impossible in microwave billiards .",
    "nevertheless , a level statistics which is indistinguishable from poissonian has been achieved for the first few hundreds of resonance frequencies in measurements with superconducting microwave billiards with an integrable classical dynamics . in these experiments ,",
    "the lengths of the antennas was chosen such that they did not reach into the cavity  @xcite .",
    "thereby , any effect of the antennas on the spectral properties was reduced considerably and at the same time all eigenmodes could be excited sufficiently to obtain complete level sequences .        _",
