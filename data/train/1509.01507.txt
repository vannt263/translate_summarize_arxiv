    "gallium nitride ( gan ) nanowires ( nws ) have been of interest for nanoscale photonic @xciteand electronic @xcite device applications .",
    "the growth of gan nws by catalyst mediated @xcite as well as catalyst free @xcite methods have been reported .",
    "unlike inas , where @xmath0111@xmath2 oriented wires are usually obtained @xcite , iii - nitride nw growth has been observed along different crystal directions and is strongly dependent on growth conditions , the substrate and its orientation",
    ".    in most of the reports of gan nw growth the axis along the nanowire length ( or the growth direction ) is along either the polar @xmath00001@xmath2 direction ( i.e. c - axis ) or the non - polar directions @xmath011@xmath30@xmath2 ( a - axis ) and @xmath01@xmath100@xmath2 ( m - axis ) . on ( 0001 ) c - plane sapphire , gottschalch @xmath4 @xmath5@xcite reported the growth of vertical wires growing along c - axis using gold as catalyst , while ji @xmath4 @xmath5@xcite obtained wires growing along the a - axis with nickel catalyst . on ( 1@xmath102 ) r - plane sapphire using nickel - catalysed metalorganic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) , zhou @xmath4 @xmath5 obtained wires tilted on the substrate and growing along m - axis.@xcite on the other hand , wang @xmath4 @xmath5@xcite and qian @xmath4 @xmath5@xcite reported the growth nws along the a - axis on r - plane sapphire with nickel catalyst .",
    "the growth of inclined gan nanorods along the c - axis using m - plane ( 1@xmath100 ) sapphire as substrate without any foreign catalyst was reported recently.@xcite there are very few reports on the growth of gan nws along semipolar directions .",
    "the growth along the semi - polar @xmath010@xmath11@xmath2 direction has been reported on c - plane sapphire by park @xmath4 @xmath5 by reaction of metallic ga and gaseous nh@xmath6 by using nickel as the catalyst.@xcite peng @xmath4 @xmath5 also reported growth along @xmath010@xmath11@xmath2 but on graphite substrates , using a mixture of ga@xmath7o@xmath6 and c along with nh@xmath6 as precursor , by a hot - filament cvd , without any catalyst.@xcite tessarek @xmath4 @xmath5 obtained gan wires via a self - catalyzed method by mocvd , on different planes of sapphire , namely c- , r- a- and m - plane .",
    "these wires grew invariably along the c - axis with diameters more than 200 nm.@xcite there are , however , hardly any reports that compare gan nw growth on different substrate orientations in the same run .",
    "we report the growth of thin , nickel - catalysed , gan nws on c- , r- and m - plane sapphire substrates under identical conditions .",
    "we studied the dependence of growth direction on the substrate orientation with other growth conditions kept similar , and characterized the samples using electron microscopy , x - ray diffraction , photoluminescence and raman spectroscopy .",
    "gan nws were grown using mocvd with nickel catalyst and trimethylgallium ( tmga ) and ammonia ( nh@xmath6 ) as precursors .",
    "the substrates were cleaned , drop - coated with nickel nitrate hexahydrate solution ( @xmath8  0.01  m ) , blow - dried with n@xmath7 gas and annealed in hydrogen to form metallic nickel nanoparticles which subsequently served as the catalyst particle.@xcite this method to form the catalyst particles is more convenient than techniques involving evaporation of nickel or gold .",
    "the size of the catalyst particle can be controlled by the annealing time and temperature ( see supplementary information section ii for details ) .",
    "since the exact composition and phase ( solid / liquid ) of the nickel - gallium alloy that serves as the catalyst during growth is unknown , the nw growth mechanism could be either vapour - liquid - solid ( vls ) or vapour - solid - solid ( vss ) . from a post - growth compositional analysis of the catalyst particle ( not presented here ) , we believe that at the growth temperatures used in our experiments ( @xmath9c ) gan nw growth happens via a vss process .",
    "we also tried to grow gan nws using gold nanoparticles as catalyst .",
    "gold catalysed wires grew slower than their nickel assisted counterparts under similar growth conditions , as reported by zhou @xmath4",
    "@xmath5.@xcite        we varied the temperature , reactor pressure and rate of flow of precursors in order to obtain thin and non - tapering nws .",
    "the growth of nws was sensitive to the reactor conditions .",
    "we first discuss the effect of carrier gas on growth .",
    "after annealing the nickel nitrate hexahydrate coated sapphire substrates in a hydrogen environment to produce nickel nanoparticles , we could grow gan nws in a pure nitrogen ambient .",
    "the scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of the nws is shown in figure [ fig : growth](a ) .",
    "the wires typically had a triangular cross section ( figure [ fig : growth](b ) ) .",
    "however , under similar reactor conditions in an h@xmath7 ambient or in a mixture of equal volumes of n@xmath7 and h@xmath7 , we did not obtain any wires .",
    "instead , we obtained just hemispherical gallium droplets ( figure [ fig : growth](c),(d ) ) , unlike earlier reports.@xcite    nws were grown on different orientations of sapphire namely c - plane , r - plane and m - plane .",
    "the nws obtained from the same growth run at @xmath10c and 150  torr with @xmath845  @xmath11mol / min ( @xmath81  sccm ) nh@xmath6 flow and 7.8  @xmath11mol / min ( 2  sccm ) tmga flow on these substrates are shown in figure [ fig : orientation ] .",
    "on these substrates we obtained nws as thin as 20  nm diameter with a triangular cross section .",
    "the growth temperature was varied between @xmath12c and @xmath13c .",
    "experiments carried out at different reactor pressures between 50  torr and 200  torr ( figure [ fig : pressure ] ) showed that long thin nws were obtained at 150  torr . at a relatively low pressure of 100  torr icecream - cone",
    "shaped structures were formed .",
    "a lot of wires grown at 175 torr had kinks or had a zig - zag morphology . at 200  torr",
    "there were very little nw growth , and those few were highly tapered and short .",
    "very low flow of precursors ( 7.8 - 9.7  @xmath11mol / min of tmga and @xmath845  @xmath11mol / min of nh@xmath6 ) and small v / iii ratio ( @xmath14 ) was used to facilitate anisotropic growth . at large v / iii ratio",
    "the growth is slower , while at low v / iii ratio the nws obtained are more tapered .",
    "( for sem images refer supporting information section i. ) we found that a pressure of 150 torr in n@xmath7 environment , @xmath15c and a v / iii ratio of @xmath14 was optimum for obtaining thin non - tapering wires .",
    "a comparison of the nws obtained on different planes which are shown in figure [ fig : orientation ] is given in table 1 .",
    "all these samples compared are from the same growth run ( at @xmath10c and 150  torr with @xmath845  @xmath11mol / min nh@xmath6 flow and 7.8  @xmath11mol / min tmga flow ) .",
    "the length of the nws were determined by imaging cross sectional samples .",
    "the nws obtained on c - plane sapphire are narrower than the nws on r - plane . on m - plane sapphire",
    "we see two distinct set of nws  one which is narrow ( thickness @xmath8  30  nm ) and one which is thicker ( thickness @xmath8  90  nm ) .",
    "since the nws on m - plane sapphire are not erect , it is difficult to measure its exact length , but they are longer than nws grown on c- and r - plane .",

    "the crystal structure and the crystallinity of the nws were analyzed using x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "the grazing incidence xrd pattern the gan nanowires grown on c - plane , r - plane and m - plane sapphire substrates is shown in figure [ fig : xrd ] .",
    "the peaks are quite sharp indicating good crystal quality .",
    "the peak positions have been indexed to the wurtzite crystal structure of gan .",
    "the lattice constants obtained by least square fitting from the peak positions were a  =  3.188   and c  =  5.179  which agrees with values reported in literature.@xcite              the crystallinity and growth direction of the wires grown on c- , m- and r - plane sapphire were determined using tem .",
    "since the nw thickness is less than 100  nm they are electron transparent and do not require further thinning down for tem studies .",
    "the sample on which wires were grown was ultrasonicated in methanol to make a suspension .",
    "this suspension was slowly dropped multiple times onto a tem grid and the solvent allowed to evaporate .",
    "the presence of the catalyst nanoparticle seen at the end of the wire in the tem image ( figure [ fig : tem ] ( a ) ) confirms that the growth was catalytic . from energy",
    "dispersive x - ray spectroscopy the presence of ga in the catalyst along with ni was confirmed .",
    "the lattice planes seen in the high resolution tem images ( figure [ fig : tem](b ) ) and the well - defined electron diffraction pattern obtained ( figure [ fig : tem](c ) ) confirm the single crystal nature of these wires .",
    "the diffraction pattern was indexed to find the lattice planes that gave rise to the diffraction spots . by comparing the diffraction pattern and the low magnification tem image of the wire ,",
    "the growth axis was determined . an indexed electron diffraction pattern obtained with a tem",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : temms ] showing that the growth direction is @xmath010@xmath11@xmath2 for this wire .",
    "the wires grew along the m - axis ( @xmath010@xmath10@xmath2 ) on both c - plane ( figure [ fig : tem](c ) ) and r - plane sapphire substrates . on m - plane sapphire most of the nws grew along the @xmath010@xmath11@xmath2 ( figure [ fig : temms ] ) and @xmath010@xmath10@xmath2 directions ( table 1 ) .",
    "the optical properties of the gan nws were studied using photoluminescence ( pl ) spectroscopy from ensembles of nws .",
    "the sample was excited with a 266  nm frequency - quadrupled nd : yag laser .",
    "the luminescence from the sample was dispersed through a 0.55  m monochromator and detected with a thermoelectrically cooled si - ccd .     *",

    "( spectra are displaced for clarity.),scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the pl spectra of gan nws at 10  k grown on c - plane , r - plane and m - plane sapphire are shown in figure [ fig : pl ] .",
    "the spectra are normalized such that the near - band - edge emission peak is of the same intensity .",
    "pl spectra from these nws peak around 3.50  ev ( 354  nm ) , which corresponds to the near - band - edge emission of gan.@xcite the fwhm of the pl peaks are @xmath8  22 nm ( 220  mev ) , @xmath8  42  nm ( 390  mev ) and @xmath8  37  nm ( 350  mev ) for nws grown on c - plane , r - plane and m - plane sapphire respectively .",
    "these fwhm values are comparable to those reported in literature.@xcite the width of these spectra could be due to the variation in thickness and properties of the different wires of the ensemble,@xcite or due to defect - related luminescence.@xcite an additional peak is observed at @xmath8 3.1  ev ( 400  nm ) which might be due to strongly localized excitons.@xcite .",
    "yellow luminescence from these samples is relatively small indicating good crystal quality .",
    "raman spectroscopy was used to study the phonon modes of gan nws .",
    "a witec alpha 300r confocal raman microscope was used with a 532  nm frequency doubled nd : yag laser for excitation .     *",

    "( spectra are displaced for clarity.),scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ fig : raman ] shows the raman spectra for single gan nws , that were transferred to an aluminium foil which serves as the substrate .",
    "al foil was chosen as substrate since it provides much lesser background signal in the region of interest than conventional crystalline substrates like si , gaas , sapphire , etc and other amorphous substrates .",
    "the intensity of the raman peaks depends on the direction of both the incident and scattered polarization vectors relative to the crystal orientation . in order to observe as many phonons as possible from nws from all samples the incident electric field",
    "was set at an angle of @xmath16 with the nw axis , and the scattered light of all polarizations were detected simultaneously .",
    "( the spectra shown is after background correction . )",
    "difference in relative intensity may due to difference in growth direction of nw and/or because the incident light might be falling in different direction relative to the crystallographic directions .    at",
    "around 144 , 567 and 734  @xmath17 the e@xmath7 ( low ) , e@xmath7 ( high ) and e@xmath18 ( lo ) are seen.@xcite these peaks are allowed by group theory in a infinitely large sample with wurtzite crystal structure belonging to the space group @xmath19 ( p6@xmath6mc ) , and has been observed experimentally in first order raman spectra .",
    "but , the other peaks observed in the spectrum shown ( figure [ fig : raman ] ) arise due to the finite dimensions of the nws .",
    "the acoustic phonons , and also the combination of both acoustic and low - lying optical branches at the m symmetry point in the brillouin zone gives rise to the spectral peak around 256  @xmath17.@xcite the peak at @xmath8 308  @xmath17 arises from the overtone process of acoustic phonons and the energy position matches the flat phonon branch at the h - point in the brillouin zone .",
    "the peak observed in the spectra at @xmath8 418  @xmath17 also is an acoustic overtone corresponding to the m - point.@xcite the raman peaks are broader compared to those reported in bulk samples due to the finite size effects in accordance with the phonon confinement model , where the spatial confinement of phonons in nanocrystals leads to an uncertainty in wave vector and hence a broadening of the raman spectral lines.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have grown gan nws on c - plane , m - plane , and r - plane sapphire substrates using nickel catalyst and tmga and nh@xmath6 as precursors by mocvd .",
    "a pressure of 150  torr in n@xmath7 environment and @xmath20c , with low precursor flow rates and v - iii ratio , was optimum for growing thin , non - tapering gan nws .",
    "the wires had a triangular cross - section and grew along the @xmath010@xmath11@xmath2 and @xmath010@xmath10@xmath2 directions .",
