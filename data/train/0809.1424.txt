    "since 1995 , over 300 planets have been identified around stars other than the sun , revealing a remarkable diversity in the properties of planets as well as the architecture of planetary systems . yet ,",
    "the three hitherto successful planet detection techniques  radial velocity monitoring , transit searches and microlensing surveys  are generally limited to planets in orbits much smaller than the full radial extent of our solar system .",
    "thus , the discoveries to date , while dramatic , can only provide an incomplete picture of the overall planet population .",
    "direct imaging can help complete the census by uncovering planets at wide separations .",
    "furthermore , it enables extensive follow - up studies to characterize the planets .",
    "however , due to the small angular separation and the high brightness contrast between a planet and its star , direct imaging has not succeeded thus far ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at present",
    ", our best hope lies in targeting nearby young stars for newborn planets .    during their formation ,",
    "giant planets and brown dwarfs ( bds ) , like stars , generate heat from gravitational contraction .",
    "but , unlike stars , which eventually reach core temperatures sufficient for hydrogen fusion , these objects are left without a means of producing energy , and thus rapidly cool down and become dimmer with time",
    ". therefore younger planets and bds , as companions to stars , are much easier to detect directly than their older counterparts .",
    "accordingly , the lowest mass companions imaged",
    "so far all orbit stars younger than @xmath030  myr ; several of them ( e.g. chxr  73  b , @xcite ; ab  pic  b , @xcite ; dh  tau  b , @xcite ; gq  lub  b , @xcite ) have masses slightly above the deuterium burning limit of 13  @xmath6 , which is often used as a boundary to differentiate planets from the more massive bds , though some researchers prefer a distinction based on the formation mechanism , whereby planets form within a circumstellar disk and bds form through cloud fragmentation .",
    "one lower mass companion ( @xmath08  @xmath6 ) orbits the young 25  @xmath6 bd 2massw  j1207334 - 393254 , rather than a star @xcite ; other similar systems might exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all of these low - mass sub - stellar companions are located at large separations from their primaries , in sharp contrast with solar system planets and extra - solar planets detected by indirect methods , possibly reflecting a fundamental difference in their formation mechanism .    here",
    "we report the direct imaging discovery of a 612  @xmath6 candidate companion to a young solar - mass star , 1rxs  j160929.1 - 210524 , in the nearby ( @xmath7  pc ) , 5  myr - old upper scorpius association @xcite .",
    "initial imaging of 1rxs  j160929.1 - 210524  was done on 2008 april 27 in @xmath8 using the niri camera @xcite and the altair adaptive optics system @xcite at the gemini north telescope .",
    "we used 5 dither positions , with at each position one co - addition of twenty 0.3  s integrations in fast , high read - noise mode , and one single 10  s integration in slow , low read - noise mode , thus at each position providing an unsaturated image of the target star and a much deeper image of the field that can be registered and scaled in flux without ambiguity .",
    "follow - up imaging in @xmath3 and @xmath9 was obtained on 2008 june 21 using the same instrument . for @xmath3 , we again used 5 dither positions with thirty 0.2  s and a single 10  s co - addition at each position , and for @xmath9 we used 7 dither positions with ten 0.5  s and a single 10  s co - addition .",
    "the imaging data were reduced using custom _ idl _ routines .",
    "we subtracted a sky frame constructed using the median of the images at all dither positions ( with regions dominated by the target s signal masked ) , divided by a normalized flat - field , and replaced bad pixels by a median over their neighbors .",
    "next , we merged the long- and short - exposure images , properly scaled in intensity , and co - aligned and co - added the resulting images .",
    "a composite color image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up was done on 2008 june 21 , using niri in grism mode with altair at the gemini north telescope .",
    "we used the @xmath10 10-pixel wide ( 0.214 ) slit , rotated to obtain spectra of the primary and companion simultaneously .",
    "we obtained five exposures of 180  s in @xmath4 and 210  s in @xmath3 , at nods separated by 4.44  along the slit .",
    "for telluric and instrumental transmission correction , the a0v star hd  138813 was observed in @xmath4 before the science target , and hd  151787 in @xmath3 afterwards . to confirm the reliability of the data , further sets of @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra were taken on 2008 august 21 and 2008 august 24 , respectively .",
    "this time , in @xmath4 , twelve 180  s exposures were taken in four groups of three 4.44  nods , each group being further nodded by 0.3 , and in @xmath3 , nine 180  s exposures were obtained in three similarly nodded groups . for calibration , hd  151787",
    "was observed after the science target for both sequences .    with the wide slit ,",
    "we minimize effects from the chromatic adaptive - optics - corrected point - spread function , atmospheric differential refraction ( @xmath11 in - band ) , or small errors in nod position .",
    "based on our imaging , slit losses should vary by at most 5% between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , even if the standards are taken with slightly different image quality , residual slit effects in the calibrated fluxes should be small . with the wide slit ,",
    "the point - spread function sets the resolution of @xmath12    in @xmath3 and @xmath13    in @xmath4 .",
    "the data were reduced using custom _ idl _ routines .",
    "we first subtracted the sky background , determined from exposures at different nods , divided by a normalized flat field , and masked bad pixels .",
    "the images were then rectified , using cubic interpolation , for the slight curvature of the traces .",
    "we extracted optimally - weighted fluxes using the normalized trace of the spectrum , constructed separately for each image and allowed to vary slowly with wavelength .",
    "we chose a 2.0  width for the trace , for which chromatic effects should be less than a few percent .",
    "the companion s spectrum was extracted using the same trace , but shifted in position , truncated to 0.25 , and properly re - normalized to avoid introducing additional chromatic effects . prior to extraction , any remaining flux from the primary was removed by subtracting a straight line along the spatial direction fitted to both sides of the companion s trace .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using exposures of an ar arc lamp .",
    "next , we divided the spectra by those of the telluric standard , corrected for their spectral slope using a 9520  k blackbody curve , and with hydrogen absorption lines removed by dividing by voigt profile fits to each line .",
    "since the @xmath4- and @xmath3-band spectra obtained in june and august were very similar , we co - added them to improve the signal - to - noise ratio . finally , we flux - calibrated the spectra relative to the 2mass magnitudes of the primary ( using the spectral response and zero points given in @xcite ) .",
    "synthetic 2mass contrasts and colors for the companion computed from the flux - calibrated spectra agree within a few percent with the values obtained from the photometry .",
    "the position of the companion relative to the primary was found by fitting a 2-d gaussian model to both the primary and companion psfs ; the orientation of the image was obtained from the fits header .",
    "the measurements uncertainties were estimated from the dispersions of the measurements made on all the individual images .",
    "we obtained a separation of @xmath14 pixels , corresponding to @xmath15 given the pixel scale of 0.0214 , and a position angle of @xmath16  deg .",
    "systematic uncertainties are likely larger than measurement uncertainties ; based on previous experience with similar observations we estimate them at @xmath00.03  for the separation and @xmath00.5  deg for the position angle .",
    "the relative photometry was computed using aperture photometry with a radius of one psf fwhm .",
    "an azimuthally symmetric median intensity profile was subtracted from the images prior to measuring the flux of the companion to avoid contamination from the primary .",
    "the uncertainties were estimated from the dispersion of the measurements made on all of the individual images in each filter .",
    "the results are shown in table  1 ; the near - infrared colors of the companion suggest a mid - l spectral type .",
    "for completeness , we note that four other faint sources were detected farther from the primary , but these have @xmath17 and thus are likely background stars .",
    "the spectra of both the primary and its candidate companion are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , alongside template spectra of known bds in upper scorpius @xcite , field dwarfsspex / spexlibrary / irtflibrary.html ] @xcite and synthetic spectra from the dusty models @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the companion confirms that it is very cool , showing important water vapor absorption on either sides of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands and strong co band heads beyond 2.29  @xmath18 m .",
    "compared with field dwarfs , the @xmath3-band spectrum of our companion has a much more triangular shape which is likely caused by lower surface gravity , as evidenced by the much better agreement with the young upper scorpius bds and the low - gravity model spectra .",
    "indeed , the model spectra show that the blue side of the @xmath3-band spectrum is suppressed as the surface gravity decreases ; a similar effect is present at the blue side of the @xmath4 band .",
    "also , the triangular @xmath3-band profile is a well - known indicator of low surface gravity that has been observed and discussed in many instances in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "lower surface gravity would be expected for an object that has not yet fully contracted , and thus these features confirm the youth of the candidate companion .",
    "uncertainties in the model opacities could account for the mismatch on the red side of the @xmath3-band for low gravities , and thus this should not be taken as evidence of high gravity @xcite .",
    "overall , reasonable fits of dusty model spectra are obtained with effective temperatures of 1700 - 1900  k and @xmath19 of 3.55.0 , with a best fit for 1800  k.    the @xmath20 color of the companion complements the @xmath21 spectroscopy and offers one more check of its temperature .",
    "although low - gravity bds generally appear redder than their older counterparts for a given spectral type @xcite , all but one of the known low - gravity bds earlier than l2 in the sample of @xcite are bluer than our companion ; the exception being the extremely peculiar 2mass  j01415823 - 4633574 ( l0pec , @xmath22 ) . similarly , all upper scorpius bds ( m8l2 ) in the sample of @xcite , except for two l1 , have bluer colors . finally , most bds later than l5 , particularly those with lower gravity , have redder colors .",
    "thus the @xmath20 color indicates a spectral type of l2l5 .    given the above considerations , and based primarily on the comparison with model spectra , we infer @xmath23  k , corresponding to a spectral type of l4@xmath2 given the @xmath24spectral type relation of @xcite .",
    "the age of the upper scorpius association is well constrained at 5  myr with no significant age spread : all star formation seemingly occurred over a period of less than 1  myr @xcite .",
    "this value of 5  myr is consistently obtained from isochrone fitting using several different evolution models , and is in good agreement with the @xmath04.5  myr kinematic age of the association , obtained by tracing back the proper motions of massive stars @xcite . given an age estimate of @xmath25  myr and @xmath23  k for the candidate companion , the dusty evolutionary models yield a mass of @xmath26 , below the deuterium burning limit .",
    "the mass uncertainty quoted reflects the widest interval obtained for the quoted ranges of age and @xmath24 . as an additional test",
    ", we can compare not just the temperature ( colors ) , but also the magnitudes ( luminosity ) of the object against the model predictions : the best agreement [ @xmath27 is obtained for a mass of 0.008  @xmath28 , an age of 5  myr and a distance of 150  pc ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "factoring in the uncertainties on the photometry measurements as well as those on the age and distance , this approach yields a mass estimate of 0.0070.012  @xmath28 . as yet another check , we consider the evolution models of @xcite ; for the above @xmath24 and age estimates , these models yield a mass of 0.0070.0011  @xmath28 .",
    "of course , despite this , some fundamental shortcomings , or lack of absolute calibration , in the models used for the estimates of age , temperature and mass could result in higher uncertainties than those presented above , but given the difficulty in quantifying such errors we can only alert the readers to this possibility .",
    "the primary star was classified as a member of the upper scorpius association by @xcite and @xcite based on lithium absorption , x - ray emission , and position in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ; these authors determined a spectral type of m0v based on low - resolution optical spectroscopy .",
    "new high - resolution optical spectra suggest a slightly earlier spectral type , k7v@xmath29 , based on a comparison of several atomic and molecular lines with spectral templates ( d.c .",
    "nguyen , private communication ) .",
    "this is also consistent with our near - infrared spectrum , and corresponds to @xmath30  k @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for this effective temperature , the predictions of the nextgen evolutionary models @xcite , using @xmath31 , are in very good agreement with the photometric measurements of the primary for an age of 5  myr and a distance of 150  pc ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , and indicate a mass of @xmath32  @xmath28 .",
    "we found no evidence for on - going accretion in the optical and near - infrared spectra , nor signs of significant reddening , consistent with the value of @xmath33 reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reports no infrared excess at 8.0  @xmath18 m and 16.0  @xmath18 m ( see also fig .  [ fig2 ] ) based on _ spitzer _ observations ; this indicates that there is little if any disk material left around the star , consistent with the absence of any spectroscopic signatures of on - going mass accretion .",
    "our adaptive optics images indicate that the primary is not itself a near - equal luminosity binary with a separation larger than @xmath34  ( @xmath35  au ) .",
    "a summary of the properties of the primary and companion is given in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "lcc angular separation ( ) & + position angle ( deg ) & + @xmath36 ( mag ) & + @xmath37 ( mag ) & + @xmath38 ( mag ) & + @xmath39 ( mag ) & @xmath40 & + @xmath9 ( mag ) & @xmath41 & @xmath42 + @xmath3 ( mag ) & @xmath43 & @xmath44 + @xmath8 ( mag ) & @xmath45 & @xmath46 + @xmath47 [ 4.5@xmath18 m ] ( mjy ) & @xmath48 & + @xmath47 [ 8.0@xmath18m](mjy ) & @xmath49 & + @xmath47 [ 16.0@xmath18 m ] ( mjy ) & @xmath50 & + @xmath20 ( mag ) & @xmath51 & @xmath52 + @xmath53 ( mag ) & @xmath54 & @xmath55 + spectral type & k7v@xmath561 & l4@xmath2 + @xmath24 ( k ) & @xmath30 & @xmath1 + radius ( @xmath57 ) & @xmath58 & @xmath59 + mass ( @xmath28 ) & @xmath32 & @xmath60 + projected separation ( au ) &",
    "although our photometry and spectroscopy establish that the candidate companion has low gravity and a mass below 0.012  @xmath28 , they do not prove that it is physically bound to the primary star rather than a free - floating planet in the association .",
    "based on integration of their best - fit mass function , @xcite estimate that the entire upper scorpius population comprises 2525 stars more massive than @xmath61  @xmath28 , distributed over an area of @xmath0150  deg@xmath62 .",
    "assuming very conservatively that there are as many free - floating planets in the association as there are stars @xmath61  @xmath28 , the probability that one would fall within 2.5  from any of the 85 stars we have observed would be only 0.002 .",
    "thus this scenario is unlikely .",
    "verification of common proper - motion over the next few years will nevertheless be important , although it would not readily confirm physical association of the two objects given the small internal velocity dispersion of the association .",
    "the latter would require detection of orbital motion , which could take several years given the small orbital motion expected ( @xmath02  mas  yr@xmath63 ) .",
    "previous direct imaging surveys for planets around nearby solar - type stars have put upper limits of @xmath06% on the fraction of stars with planets more massive than 5  @xmath6 at separations over @xmath050  au ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "our single candidate in a sample of @xmath085 stars is consistent with these results , and confirms that planets on wide separations are rare also at ages of a few myr .",
    "compared to known star - planet systems , the inferred mass for the candidate companion of 1rxs  j160929.1 - 210524  is near the high end of the range .",
    "what stands out even more is the large separation of @xmath64300  au .",
    "the simplest explanations would be that there is no physical association or that the companion has recently been ejected .",
    "both appear unlikely , however , and thus it seems worthwhile to speculate about possible formation scenarios . in situ growth via",
    "core accretion @xcite appears unlikely : the formation timescale would greatly exceed the age of the system , even if a disk could survive long enough . on the other hand , at smaller separations this mechanism could build a @xmath05  @xmath6 planet in 15  myr @xcite ,",
    "which might then migrate outwards through interactions with a disk or other massive planets ( either can be quite rapid ; @xcite ) . a problem with this alternative ,",
    "however , is that a planet formed through core accretion may not be able to reach the observed temperature @xcite .",
    "in situ formation via gravitational instability @xcite is another possibility , but it would require a rather massive ( @xmath650.2 - 0.35 m@xmath66 ) disk .",
    "typical disks around t tauri stars contain only 0.010.1 m@xmath66 of material @xcite , but more massive disks may exist during earlier proto - stellar phases .",
    "still , the thermal state of the disk may prevent fragmentation even at radii as large as required here @xcite .",
    "lastly , this system may have formed like a binary star , through the fragmentation of a pre - stellar core .",
    "current star formation simulations , however , find it difficult to make binaries with extreme mass ratios and very low mass components @xcite .",
    "future observations could look for additional closer - in companions , evidence of a large debris disk , and whether the object we found is in a highly eccentric or nearly circular orbit .",
    "if bound , the very existence of the 1rxsj1609 - 2105  system poses a challenge to theories of planet and star formation , and may well suggest that there is more than one mechanism in nature for producing planetary mass companions around normal stars .",
    "we thank the gemini staff , particularly jean - ren roy and andrew stephens , for help and support with the observations , duy nguyen , kaitlin kratter , subhanjoy mohanty , and adam kraus for discussions , and mark marley for pointing out possible problems with core accretion formation .",
