    "the holographic principle , an anticipated feature of quantum gravity , asserts that at least certain theories of gravity can be described as quantum field theories that live in one less spacetime dimension .",
    "for example , in the ads / cft correspondence  a concrete realization of the holographic principle  the gravity system lives in a @xmath0 dimensional anti - desitter ( ads ) spacetime and is equivalent to a conformal field theory ( cft ) that lives on the @xmath1 dimensional boundary of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "the extra dimension in the bulk spacetime is identified with the length scale of the boundary system , and the renormalization group equations essentially generalize the equations that describe gravity .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the _ multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz _ ( mera ) @xcite  an efficient representation of ground states of local hamiltonians on a lattice @xcite  realizes at least some features of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "for example , the mera representation of the ground state of a one dimensional ( 1d ) quantum lattice system is a two dimensional ( 2d ) hyperbolic tensor network , which also describes the rg flow of the ground state .",
    "specifically , the mera is based on a real space rg transformation , known as _ entanglement renormalization _ , that removes local entanglement before coarse - graining the state @xcite . in particular",
    ", the extra dimension of the tensor network corresponds to length scale of the 1d system .    in ref .",
    "one of us introduced a toy model for holography based on the mera representation of ground states of 1d local hamiltonians , however , without paying attention to symmetries .",
    "the model illustrates a possible way in which the mera could encode a dual 2d bulk description of a 1d ground state .",
    "the dual bulk degrees of freedom are associated with the bonds indices of the mera , which describe the rg flow in the boundary description .",
    "a tensor network ansatz for the dual 2d bulk state is constructed by inserting 3-index tensors ( with open indices ) on the bonds of the mera tensor network .",
    "the bulk states obtained in this way from the mera exhibit some interesting features .",
    "first , they generally satisfy an area law entanglement scaling @xcite .",
    "second , the entanglement in certain bulk states is organized according to holographic screens",
    ". and third , boundary correlators of scaling operators ( of the underlying cft ) in a critical boundary state can be obtained as the expectation value of extended bulk operators in certain dual bulk states .",
    "some of these results caricature certain features of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we further develop the toy model .",
    "we present a generalized bulk ansatz that retains the above three features , but also exhibits new features that result from the presence of a global onsite symmetry in the boundary description .    in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , a global onsite symmetry of the boundary system generally translates to a local gauge symmetry in the dual bulk description @xcite . consequently , the bulk description generally consists , in addition to gravitational and matter degrees of freedom , gauge fields that are described by the boundary global symmetry group . in the quantum gravity regime",
    ", the bulk state is expected to be entangled between all these degrees of freedom . in this paper , we describe how these features of the ads / cft correspondence can be realized within the framework introduced in ref .  .    on the other hand",
    ", symmetries must be properly accounted for in the rg description of a quantum many - body system , in order to reproduce the large - scale properties effectively . for example , consider 1d local , gapped hamiltonians that have a global onsite @xmath2 symmetry corresponding to @xmath3 rotations about two orthogonal axes .",
    "these hamiltonians can be partitioned into two different equivalence classes or quantum phases , each with distinct large length scale properties : the haldane phase and the trivial phase @xcite .",
    "more specifically , ground states belonging to the haldane phase can not be disentangled to a product state along the rg flow , as long as the rg ( entanglement renormalization ) transformations protect the symmetry .",
    "( since product states are representative of the trivial phase . )",
    "one way to ensure this is to impose that the tensors that implement entanglement renormalization commute with the symmetry .",
    "the resulting _ symmetry - protected entanglement renormalization _ generates a mera representation that captures both the expected rg flow of the ground state , and also its global symmetry exactly @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a local 1d hamiltonian that has a global onsite symmetry @xmath4 .",
    "we represent its ground state by a _",
    "symmetry - protected _ mera and propose a tensor network ansatz for the dual 2d bulk state , by extending the construction of ref .  .",
    "the bulk ansatz is decribed by a 2d tensor network that is obtained by inserting a 4-index tensor on every bond of the mera ; each bond tensor has two open indices .",
    "the open indices of the bulk tensor network are associated with the dual bulk degrees of freedom .",
    "the bond tensors have particular symmetry properties , which ensure that the bulk states have a local gauge symmetry @xmath4 , thus realizing the holographic translation of a boundary global symmetry to a local gauge symmetry in the bulk .    more broadly",
    ", we establish a connection between the mera and lattice gauge theories ( on a hyperbolic lattice ) in one higher dimension . in a lattice gauge theory , the degrees of freedom are placed on the edges of the lattice , and elementary gauge transformations act on the sites located immediately around a vertex . in our bulk construction ,",
    "the bulk lattice overlays the mera tensor network , after it is embedded in a manifold , and the dual bulk degrees of freedom live on the edges of the bulk lattice ( that is , the bonds of the tensor network ) .",
    "elementary gauge transformations act on the bulk sites located immediately around a tensor .",
    "in particular , the two open indices of a bond tensor carry the ` left ' and ` right ' gauge transformations respectively .",
    "mimicking this basic setup of a lattice gauge theory allows us to manifest a bulk gauge symmetry , which is seen to be dual to the global symmetry at the boundary .",
    "one may , in retrospect , view this as an underlying motivation for associating the dual bulk degrees of freedom with the bonds of the tensor network , as opposed to e.g. associating them with the tensors @xcite .",
    "we show how the bulk states decompose as a superposition of spin network states , as they appear in a 2d lattice gauge theory with gauge group @xmath4 ( where they span the gauge invariant subspace of the hilbert space ) @xcite .",
    "the decomposition reveals entanglement and correlations between the gauge degrees of freedom and the remaining bulk degrees of freedom that are not constrained by the symmetry . by exposing the gauge degrees of freedom in the bulk",
    ", the spin network decomposition also allows one to calculate expectation values of gauge - invariant observables in the bulk .",
    "we also construct a local , gauge - invariant parent hamiltonian for certain bulk states ( corresponding to a particular choice of the bond tensors ) .    in our construction",
    ", the local gauge symmetry is hardwired into the bulk tensor network ansatz .",
    "explicit tensor network representations of quantum many - body states with a local gauge symmetry have been presented by other authors @xcite .",
    "the 2d bulk states that we construct here indeed belong to the gauge - invariant tensor network ansatz e.g. presented in @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on the construction of a gauge - invariant bulk state from the mera representation of a 1d ground state , instead of , say , variationally minimizing the energy of a 2d gauge - invariant bulk hamiltonian .",
    "finally , we remark that a _ local _",
    "symmetry also manifests simply at the level of a ( 2d ) symmetry - protected mera tensor network  a representation of a ( 1d ) quantum many - body state with a _",
    "onsite symmetry  without reference to a bulk state @xcite .",
    "in fact , a symmetry - protected mera tensor network also decomposes in terms of spin networks @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we essentially exploit these results to implement the holographic gauging of a global boundary symmetry more manifestly by means of boundary and bulk _ quantum states _ , which allows one to e.g. probe the entanglement and correlations between the gauge and the non - gauge degrees of freedom in a bulk state .",
