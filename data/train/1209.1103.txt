    "scaling relations of metallicity o / h , stellar mass @xmath0 , and star - formation rate ( sfr ) are powerful tools for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time .",
    "the star - formation `` main sequence '' ( sfms ) connects current star formation with a galaxy s stellar mass @xcite , and the mass - metallicity relation ( mzr ) links stellar mass with metal content @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that sfr influences a galaxy s position in the mzr , and introduced the `` fundamental metallicity relation '' ( fmr ) , which reduces the scatter in their local sample of galaxies to @xmath10.06dex ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is , however , evidence that galaxies outside the local universe ( @xmath6 ) do not follow the same sfms and mzr .",
    "the fmr successfully fits lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) up to @xmath7 , but fails for higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "the sfms has similar slopes with increasing redshift but larger offsets @xcite ; for a given stellar mass , a more distant galaxy has a higher sfr .",
    "starbursts at all redshifts tend to lie above the sfms , with high specific sfrs ( ssfrs ) , and too much luminosity ( or stellar mass ) for their metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these high - sfr outliers have been attributed to merger - induced episodes of star formation that tend to be short - lived and intense ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the sfms is followed by more passively evolving galaxies that form stars over longer times .    here",
    "we propose that mergers may not be directly responsible for producing the starbursts that depart from the general sfr - mass - metallicity relations . instead , independently of their cause",
    ", different modes of star formation arising from different initial sizes and densities , may be driving the deviations .",
    "_ active _ star formation that takes place in compact regions with dense gas has distinct properties from a more _ passive _ mode in larger , more tenuous regions ; in the former , dynamical times are shorter , infrared luminosities and sfrs are higher , and molecular fractions are more elevated @xcite . in the local universe , compact sizes and high - density gas characterize metal - poor starbursts which occur in dwarf galaxies with high sfrs @xcite . at high redshift , starbursts also tend to be compact in size ( @xmath8kpc in diameter , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tend to be more compact than starbursts as the same redshift , implying that those galaxies were formed by compact nuclear starbursts at even higher redshifts , @xmath9 . ] .",
    "compactness also shapes spectral energy distributions causing them to peak at shorter wavelengths , because the dust heated by a compact starburst tends to be warmer @xcite .",
    "active star formation is expected to also be characterized by high ionization parameters because of the compact and dense nature of the active sf complexes .",
    "figure  [ fig : ion ] shows the ionization parameters @xmath10 of a sample of low - metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) taken from @xcite .",
    "the ionization parameter of the hii  regions increases with ionized gas density @xmath11 ; for this sample the significance of the correlation is @xmath1299% . because the size of the hii  region is inversely correlated with density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath10 depends almost linearly on @xmath11 .",
    "anomalous hii - region excitation is frequently found in some high - redshift galaxy populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "excluding a contribution from a weak active galactic nucleus , it is likely that this excitation results from the extreme physical conditions of the _ active _ sf mode , with dense ionized gas and high sfr surface densities @xcite .",
    "such properties naturally arise in dense and compact hiiregions with particularly hard radiation fields .",
    "thus , the anomalous excitation and high ionization parameters observed in high - redshift samples may also be signatures of active starbursts which occur in a chemically unenriched interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "besides compact , dense star - forming regions , and possibly high - ionization parameters for the nebular gas , there are further , probably related , properties shared by some galaxy populations in the nearby universe and those at high redshift . as discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , some metal - poor bcds deviate significantly from the sfms and the mzr ; they are characterized by high sfrs , high ssfrs , and are situated in the sfms and the mzr in the same region as the @xmath13 lbgs . for a given ( sub - solar ) metallicity , these galaxies can have an excess of stellar mass of two orders of magnitude , and a factor of @xmath14 excess sfr for a given mass .",
    "some of the `` green peas '' and luminous compact galaxies ( lcgs ) at @xmath15 selected by @xcite and @xcite also lie in the same regions of the sfms and the mzr and show similar excesses .",
    "similar physical conditions seem to occur at all redshifts , but different galaxy populations are observed at different redshifts because of how they are selected . since extreme starbursts are rare locally , but more common at high redshift , it could be that different modes of star formation drive the scaling relations of stellar mass , metallicity , and sfr we observe .    in this paper , we present semi - analytical models which are aimed at understanding how different modes of star formation affect the sfms and mzr .",
    "in particular , we focus on metal - poor galaxies with high sfrs , which are generally more massive than would be expected given their metal abundance .",
    "we develop three families of initial conditions for star formation and compare model predictions with several samples comprising @xmath16 1100 nearby metal - poor dwarf galaxies , intermediate redshift and high - redshift galaxy populations ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the initial conditions are designed to embrace the active / passive ( compact@xmath17dense / extended@xmath17diffuse ) modes of star formation and thus distinguish the _ active _ starburst modes from more _ passive _ quiescent ones .",
    "the questions we aim to address are :    a.   why can both high and low sfrs be observed at the same metallicity ?",
    "b.   what are the specific conditions which distinguish starbursts ( active sf mode ) from quiescent star formation ( passive mode ) ?",
    "c.   is there a connection between active dwarfs and high - z starbursts in terms of their scaling relations ( sfms , mzr , fmr ) ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : sample ] we briefly describe the samples we have compiled and how we calculate the stellar mass .",
    "the sample is more completely described in paper  i. in sect .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we discuss our semi - analytical models which consider different sets of initial conditions in order to mimic the starburst and quiescent modes of star formation .",
    "comparisons of model predictions with observations are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , and sect .",
    "[ sec : gas ] discusses the relation of the gas - to - stellar mass ratio and metal abundance . in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we describe possible similarities between nearby and distant starbursts , and how the scaling relations we observe and successfully model can shed light on how galaxies evolve .",
    "our sample was compiled on the basis of three `` pseudo - observational '' parameters  `` observables '' . ] : sfr , metal abundance [ as defined by the nebular oxygen abundance , 12@xmath18(o / h ) ] , and stellar mass , @xmath0 .",
    "we included only galaxies with these data either already published , or for which we could derive the quantities ourselves ( in particular the stellar masses ) .",
    "these criteria were met by galaxies from five samples at @xmath19 : 21 nearby dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirr ) published by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter  dirr  ) , 129 of the 11mpc distance - limited sample of nearby galaxies ( 11hugs , lvl : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 89 bcds in the samples presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "seven galaxy samples at higher redshifts also have the necessary data : the `` green pea '' compact galaxies identified by the galaxy zoo team at @xmath20 @xcite , the lcg sample at @xmath21 selected by @xcite , lbgs at @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , and @xmath24 @xcite . when stellar masses were not available in the literature , we determined stellar masses from irac photometry as discussed below , and in detail in paper  i.    altogether , we consider in the analysis 1070 galaxies from @xmath19 to @xmath24 with the requisite three quantities of sfr , 12@xmath18(o / h ) , and @xmath0 . except for the galaxies with @xmath6 @xcite and a few of the lvl galaxies @xcite , metallicities for all galaxies",
    "are determined by the `` direct '' ( electron temperature ) method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since the samples are defined by requiring detections of oiii@xmath254363 .",
    "sfrs are derived from h@xmath26  luminosities corrected for extinction ; in a few bcds , the ir luminosity gave higher sfrs , so we used the higher value .",
    "sfrs using the @xcite conversion are reported to the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "paper i gives a detailed description of the sample .",
    "we calculated the stellar masses for the local samples ( dirr , bcds , 11hugs / lvl ) from _ spitzer_/irac observations at 4.5  ( and when available also 3.6 ) .",
    "we based our method on that used by @xcite who analyzed sub - solar metallicity models from @xcite to derive stellar mass - to - light ( m / l ) as a linear function of @xmath27 .",
    "the advantage of using 4.5  to measure stellar masses is that it minimizes variations in the m / l ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because the ratio depends only weakly on age and metallicity , and dust extinction is negligible .",
    "however , before calculating the masses , we subtracted the nebular continuum and recombination line emission from the broadband 4.5  photometry .",
    "nebular emission in metal - poor starbursts , both in the continuum and lines , can significantly affect photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and thus have a potentially strong impact on the inferred stellar masses .",
    "this can be especially important in the 4.5  band @xcite .",
    "hence , before applying the formalism of @xcite , from the sfr we have inferred the strength of br@xmath26  emission and the nebular continuum in the 4.5  irac band , and subtracted it from the observed flux .",
    "then , following @xcite , 4.5  luminosity was converted to stellar mass with a m / l corrected for different ages and metallicities with a color correction @xmath28[4.5 ] .",
    "all stellar masses are scaled to the @xcite imf .",
    "the final combined sample covers a @xmath4 range in stellar mass , a factor of @xmath3 in sfr , and 2 orders of magnitude in oxygen abundance .",
    "the metallicities are generally ( formally ) quite accurate , with uncertainties on the direct method of @xmath290.05dex , but the strong - line method and its comparison with the direct method of determining abundances from electron temperatures are compromised by differences in calibration that can be quite large ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see also paper  i ) .",
    "the sfrs suffer from the typical uncertainties of h@xmath26 measurements and the uncertain extinction corrections , and the uncertainty is expected to be @xmath2930% .",
    "the uncertainties on the stellar masses are typically 0.1dex ( 30% ) , but can be as high as 50 - 70% when there are unusual colors . in any case , the large dynamic range of our combined sample should overwhelm any uncertainties on individual galaxy parameters .",
    "more details are given in paper  i.      since we are interested in deviations from the scaling relations , particularly those of galaxies with high sfr , relatively high mass , and low metallicity , in paper  i we quantified a  low - metallicity starburst \" . because deviations from the mzr become significant at abundances at or below 12@xmath18(o / h)@xmath18.0 , we consider this as a threshold below which a galaxy can be considered ",
    "low - metallicity  .",
    "deviations from the sfms and the mzr become noticeable at sfrs of @xmath30@xmath31yr@xmath32 .",
    "hence we loosely define low - metallicity starburst ( lms ) as a galaxy with a sfr @xmath330.6@xmath31yr@xmath32and with 12@xmath18(o / h)@xmath348.0 .",
    "this is a rather arbitrary label , but one that enables us to identify the galaxies most likely to deviate from the scaling relations ( see paper  i ) . among the various samples ,",
    "the lmss are relatively rare : 2% of the lvl fall into this category ; @xmath111% of the bcds ; 22% of the lcgs ; and @xmath127% of the high-@xmath35 lbgs .",
    "clearly selection effects ( e.g. , emission line surveys for the bcds , emission - line flux for the lcgs ) make it more likely for a galaxy to be a lms , but there is some indication that lmss are more common at high redshift .",
    "here we develop the models with which we explore the idea that particular initial physical conditions in a galaxy s evolutionary history can change its location in the scaling relations independently of redshift .",
    "in particular , we have devised three sets of starting parameters which dictate the subsequent evolution of the galaxy , and which encompass the observed distinctions between `` active '' and `` passive '' star formation ( see sect . [",
    "sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the models and the different initial conditions are described below .    although our models have been shown to realistically approximate the chemical evolution in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in those models gas accretion has been considered . here , as a first approximation",
    ", we use a closed box in which neither infall of pristine gas nor outflow of metal - enriched material are contemplated . despite these significant limitations , which will be addressed in future work",
    ", we will show below that our models are remarkably successful in predicting the details of the sfms and mzr scaling relations .",
    "they also are consistent with the observed gas fractions both locally and at high redshift .",
    "the models developed for the present work have been renamed as mice ( ultiphase nterstellar medium hemical volution ) models .",
    "mice models adopted here are a generalization of the multi - phase model by @xcite , originally built for the solar neighborhood , and subsequently extended to the entire galaxy @xcite , and to other disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we refer to those papers for a detailed description of the general formalism .",
    "the main differences of the models presented here relative to those used to describe the chemical evolution of disk galaxies are : _ i _ ) mice models are one - zone models , with a single galactic component and without infall or outflow processes ; _ ii _ ) no radial variations are considered , so that a uniform evolution is assumed for the whole galaxy .    each galaxy",
    "is composed of four components : diffuse gas ( @xmath36 ) , clouds ( @xmath37 ) , stars ( @xmath38 ) and stellar remnants ( @xmath39 ) . at @xmath40",
    "all the mass of the galaxy is in the form of diffuse gas ; subsequently , the mass fractions are modified by several conversion processes .",
    "the main processes considered in the model are : ( _ i _ ) conversion of diffuse gas into clouds ; ( _ ii _ ) formation of stars from clouds and ( _ iii _ ) disruption of clouds by previous generations of massive stars ; ( _ iv _ ) evolution of stars into remnants and return of a fraction of their mass to the diffuse gas .",
    "we describe in the following the main equations of the model .",
    "stars form by cloud - cloud collisions with a rate @xmath41and by the interactions of massive stars with clouds with rate @xmath42 ( induced star formation ) , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mass fraction in stars and clouds , respectively , and @xmath46 is the stellar death rate . the quadratic dependence of the sfr on the mass of clouds results from the collisional nature of the process .",
    "clouds condense out of diffuse gas with a rate @xmath47 and are disrupted by cloud - cloud collisions and by winds from massive stars , with rates @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass fractions of diffuse gas .",
    "the @xmath52 exponent results from the assumption that the process of condensation of clouds occurs on the time scale of the gravitational instability in the diffuse gas , proportional to the inverse square root of the gas density .",
    "this introduces an extra power of 1/2 in the gas mass , because mass fractions are equivalent to mass densities given our assumption of constant galactic volume ( see below ) .",
    "the mass fraction of diffuse gas evolves as @xmath53 where we have assumed that clouds disrupted by cloud - cloud collisions and stellar winds produce diffuse gas .",
    "finally , stellar remnants are produced according to @xmath54 thus , the total mass of the galaxy does not change with time ( @xmath55 , closed - box model ) .      at time",
    "@xmath40 galaxies are represented as uniform - density spheres of neutral cold gas with mass density @xmath56 from which we obtain the initial radius of the galaxy @xmath57^{1/3}. \\label{eqn : rad}\\ ] ] in the mice models , galaxies evolve at _ constant volume _ , i.e. , they maintain the initial radius given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rad ] ) .",
    "in particular , we consider two values of the initial densities of atomic gas , @xmath58  g  @xmath59 and @xmath60  g  @xmath59 ( corresponding to numerical densities of 1  @xmath59 and 400  @xmath59 ) representing slowly - evolving ( se ) and rapidly - evolving ( re ) galaxies , respectively .",
    "we produced a grid of 30 galactic models by varying the following two parameters :    a.   the initial mass : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65@xmath31 ; b.   the gas density in molecular clouds : @xmath66  @xmath59 ( `` diffuse '' clouds ) , @xmath67  @xmath59 ( `` compact '' clouds ) , and @xmath68  @xmath59 ( `` hyperdense '' clouds ) .",
    "the molecular cloud ( mc ) densities are chosen to encompass the range of volume densities observed in mc complexes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relatively high densities correspond to the dense cloud cores revealed by high - density gas tracers , since these are the true sites of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "obviously , we can not capture the complexity of star formation with our models , but these densities should be representative of the range of conditions in quiescent galaxies and starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxy mass is varied to assess whether dwarf galaxies , with similar atomic and molecular cloud properties as their more massive counterparts , can be considered as scaled - down versions of giant galaxies , or -equivalently- whether massive galaxies can be viewed as scaled - up versions of dwarfs .",
    "we associate the diffuse clouds with the passive mode of star formation , and the hyperdense clouds with the active one .",
    "the distinction between active and passive modes is relatively arbitrary , so the compact clouds defined here occupy a `` grey area '' , forming stars in an intermediate mode between `` active '' and `` passive '' .",
    "obviously , star formation in real galaxies encompasses a wide range of densities ; these three classes are a simplification intended to illustrate the effects of different physical conditions which could prevail in different galaxy populations .",
    "the re galaxies in our models correspond to the starburst mode of star formation thought to be responsible for elliptical - galaxy assembly at @xmath69 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the se galaxies in our models are generally imilar to local universe spiral and irregular galaxies . in what follows",
    ", we will designate the two classes of models by re galaxies and se galaxies ; these are very loosely associated with proto - ellipticals at high redshift and spiral disks in the local universe .",
    "our intention is to distinguish between the two ways of scaling the models , in the sense of spheroid proto - galaxies which evolve rapidly and disk - like proto - galaxies which evolve more slowly .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 , @xmath41 , etc . in the evolution equations",
    "( [ eqn : eqstars])([eqn : eqrem ] ) represent `` rates '' for the outcomes of the various processes .",
    "their dependence on the fundamental parameters of the models can be estimated from educated guesses on the dominant physical processes responsible for the conversion of gas in clouds , stars and vice versa , as outlined below .",
    "however , their specific values can not be obtained from first principles only , but are determined in general from the application of the model to a large sample of data .",
    "the models adopted here have been originally developed to study the chemical evolution of the galaxy and nearby galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the coefficients regulating the various processes have been calibrated to reproduce the wealth of observational data available for the milky way and local group galaxies . in order to apply our models to the galaxies of our sample ,",
    "it is necessary to adopt simple yet robust scaling relations for the process probabilities in terms of the fundamental parameters defined in sect.[sec : initial ] , namely the initial mass @xmath70 and the density of molecular clouds @xmath71 .",
    "we start from the set of @xmath47 and @xmath41  values adopted to reproduce our galaxy in @xcite . for the most massive galaxy of our set ( 10@xmath72@xmath31 ) of se galaxies , we adopt the @xmath47 and @xmath41  values of the mw , while for the re galaxies of the same mass we increase the @xmath47 value by a factor 20 .",
    "the factor 20 arises from the higher density of the gas from which the proto - galaxy is formed , resulting in a faster conversion of atomic gas into clouds and stars , proportional to the inverse of the free - fall time , i.e. , @xmath73 . for both classes of galaxies , in case of diffuse molecular clouds we normalize the value of @xmath41  to the efficiency value adopted for the mw .",
    "we thus obtain the values of @xmath47 and @xmath41  values for the lower mass galaxies and for galaxies hosting denser molecular clouds with the relations described below .",
    "in addition , we must take into account the well known result ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the star formation efficiency increases with galaxy galactic mass @xmath70 . in our models ,",
    "the _ sfr efficiency _ is the inverse of the depletion timescale of the cloud mass fraction ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this mass dependence is implied , for example , by the increasing trend of [ mg / fe ] with @xmath70 in ellipticals ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and from the faster evolution of large disks with respect to smaller ones @xcite .",
    "this relation has taken the name of _ chemical downsizing _",
    "it is also one of the concurring arguments to explain the mass - metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the main features of local galaxies of different morphological types may be reproduced by interpreting the hubble sequence as a sequence of decreasing star formation efficiency from early types to late types , i.e. from ellipticals to irregulars ( see also * ? ? ? * for an early interpretation of the hubble sequence in terms of sfrs ) .    in our models",
    "we have scaled the rate of cloud condensation as @xmath74 and the rate of star formation as @xmath41@xmath75 .",
    "the scaling with mass corresponds basically to a scaling with size , and , at least for the parameter @xmath41 , follows naturally from the interpretation of this quantity as a _ collision frequency _ between clouds .",
    "the latter is given by the product of the number of clouds per unit volume ( roughly proportional to @xmath76 ) times the cloud s cross section ( assumed the same in all models ) and the cloud - to - cloud velocity dispersion ( proportional to @xmath77 ) .",
    "however , the sfr efficiency also depends on the dynamical ( free - fall ) time of the molecular clouds ( @xmath78 ) , which results in values of @xmath41larger by a factor of @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the case of compact and hyperdense clouds , respectively , with respect to diffuse clouds . observing that what we call `` diffuse '' clouds are typical of the mw and nearby quiescent disk galaxies @xcite",
    ", we can just scale the value of @xmath41  adopted for the mw ( taken as a reference ) to obtain the @xmath41  parameter in the other two cases .",
    "this scaling approximately reproduces the observed fraction of gas ( @xmath11% ) that forms stars during a free - fall time @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our models consist of two classes of galaxies : slowly- and rapidly - evolving galaxies . for se galaxies ,",
    "we normalized the @xmath47 coefficient of the most massive ones ( @xmath81@xmath31 ) to the coefficient of the mw model of @xcite ; for re galaxies , we adopted the same coefficient multiplied by a factor of 20 .",
    "for both classes of galaxies , in the case of diffuse molecular clouds we normalized the @xmath41  to the value adopted for the mw .",

    "the star - bursting outliers are more centrally concentrated ( compact ) than the galaxies along the main sequence ; these would have shorter dynamical times and thus be more rapidly evolving .",
    "thus , our models correctly predict that compact re _ active _ models reproduce the starburst outliers of the sfms , and that se galaxies , with their larger sizes and slower evolution , lie along it .",
    "an _ active _ sf mode is more readily associated with mergers and interactions than a _ passive _ one ; in fact , the initial conditions we attribute to active star formation may be induced by mergers and tidal compression .",

    "<S> scaling relations of metallicity ( o / h ) , star formation rate ( sfr ) , and stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) give important insight on galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> they are obeyed by most galaxies in the local universe and also at high redshift . in a companion paper , we compiled a sample of @xmath11100 galaxies from redshift 0 to @xmath2 , spanning almost two orders of magnitude in metal abundance , a factor of @xmath3 in sfr , and of @xmath4 in stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> we have characterized empirically the star - formation `` main sequence '' ( sfms ) and the mass - metallicity relation ( mzr ) for this sample , and also identified a class of low - metallicity starbursts , rare locally but more common in the distant universe . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies deviate significantly from the main scaling relations , with high sfr and low metal content for a given @xmath0 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we model the scaling relations and explain these deviations from them with a set of multi - phase chemical evolution models based on the idea that , independently of redshift , initial physical conditions in a galaxy s evolutionary history can dictate its location in the scaling relations . </S>",
    "<S> our models are able to successfully reproduce the o / h , @xmath0 , and sfr scaling relations up to @xmath5 , and also successfully predict the molecular cloud fraction as a function of stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the scaling relations are defined by different modes of star formation : an `` active '' starburst mode , more common at high redshift , and a quiescent `` passive '' mode that is predominant locally and governs the main trends .    </S>",
