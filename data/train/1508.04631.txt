    "production of hadronic jet pairs is the most common high - momentum transfer process at the lhc , and has been widely studied , first with early 2010 data @xcite , then with much larger datasets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "dijet events are used to search for new physics , in particular resonances @xcite decaying into quark or gluon final states .",
    "most of the standard measurements of dijet production are limited to jets of high transverse momentum in central pseudorapidities ( @xmath0 ) . in this kinematic configuration ,",
    "the momentum fractions of the incoming partons are relatively large and of similar order of magnitude , and in regions where strong constraints exist to the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) from deep - inelastic scattering data .",
    "also , for this high-@xmath1 kinematical configuration , it is expected that the standard dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) @xcite evolution equations provide a good approximation of the underlying physics , and in fact no sizeable deviations from the expected behaviour are observed .",
    "more interesting tests of qcd can be performed in specific corners of phase - space , where the modeling of the underlying physics may be less obvious .",
    "for instance , events with large azimuthal de - correlations are sensitive to higher - order emission of hard gluons . events with at least one jet in the forward direction can arise from an imbalance of the momentum fraction of the two partons , and therefore probe less - constraint regions of the pdfs .",
    "events where the two leading jets in the event have a large rapidity separation may be better described by theoretical models involving multiple scales and large logarithmic constributions .",
    "these configurations may require the use of different evolution equations than dglap , like the approach from balitski - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite , from ciafaloni - catani - fiorani - marchesini ( ccfm ) @xcite or inspired by gluon saturation @xcite .",
    "evidence for deviations from the dglap description in systems of forward jets has been searched for in various experiments and colliders before the lhc . d0",
    "measured forward - backward jets with rapidity separations up to 6 @xcite , while both the zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite collaborations studied the systems with forward jets in the final state . since these measurements did not give any compelling evidence for a breakdown of the validity of the dglap approach , it makes sense to pursue the study at the lhc , where the instrumentation of the detectors in the very forward region allows probing even more extreme rapidity separations .",
    "in addition to the exchange of gluons varying qcd color , dijet events could also be produced by the exchange of color - neutral gluon ladders .",
    "the probability of these kinds of processes is roughly independent on the rapidity separation between the dijets , while the more common color - singlet exchange has an exponentially decreasing dependence on the rapidity separation .",
    "the consequence is that events with large rapidity separation are proportionally more likely to be produced by color singlets , a configuration where no additional radiation between the jets is emitted .",
    "the experimental study of events with jet veto , where only the events without hard emission in the rapidity region between the two leading dijets are selected , can enhance the occurrence of interesting regions of phase space .",
    "combination between some of the techniques described above ( like for instance the study of azimuthal de - correlations for events with and without jet veto ) can probe even more specific regions of phase - space , highlighting the potentially different ability to describe the data by the various theoretical approaches .    in the following sections ,",
    "several measurements are presented where qcd is probed in specific corners of phase - space , with specific emphasis on measurements in the forward region of the detectors .",
    "the first measurements to test qcd in difficult regions of phase - space of the dijet system have been dijet azimuthal decorrelations . at born level ,",
    "the outgoing partons in a 2@xmath2 2 interaction are produced exactly back - to - back in the azimuthal plane , and with equal transverse momentum .",
    "hadronisation effects leading from partons to jets little change this picture , so in the absence of extra radiation the angle between the two jets is supposed to be very close to @xmath3 , and indeed this is the case for the majority of the events .",
    "soft gluon radiation will contribute to small deviations with respect to the back - to - back configuration , but it is only hard gluon radiation , resulting in multijet final states , that can lead to significant deviations from the back - to - back configuration .",
    "the measurement of azimuthal de - correlation is therefore a test of qcd in various regimes , as well as a probe for various initial state radiation ( isr ) models , since hard isr can boost the dijet system in the transverse plane .",
    "figure [ fig : azimuthal ] shows the distribution of the azimuthal angle as measured by atlas using the data collected in 2010 ( left)@xcite , unfolded to particle level and compared to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd as computed by nlojet++ @xcite .",
    "a different approach is the one shown in the right plot of that figure , where the ratio is shown of the aximuthal angle distribution from data collected by cms @xcite to the predictions from d6 t pythia6@xcite tunes . in this case , the parameter responsible for isr [ parp(67 ) ] has been varied over a wide range of values ( including the default of 2.5 ) .",
    "it can be observed that the default value gives a very good description of the data , while for extreme values like 1 the discrepancy with data is large .",
    "varying this parameter by @xmath4 gives variations at the 30% level , showing that the azimuthal decorrelation is sensitive to isr , and can be used to tune this parameter .",

    "the early measurements of azimuthal decorrelations were performed on jets in the central region , for reasons of trigger efficiency and uniformity of detector response . measuring the cross section for inclusive jets and dijets in the forward region",
    "probes a region of the proton pdfs that is less constraint by deep - inelastic scattering data , and also where perturbative qcd makes less solid predictions .",
    "it was remarked , for instance , that for dijets with similar transverse momenta , the cross section has a strong dependence on the choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales , and that actually the usual choice of setting these values to the transverse momentum of the leading jet can lead to negative cross sections in some corners of the phase - space , such as for large rapidity separations . in the atlas publication @xcite the theory prediction had a choice of scales that depends exponentially on @xmath5 , half the absolute value of the dijet rapidity separation : @xmath6    cms measured the inclusive cross section for forward jets , and for dijets where one of them is in the forward region , in ref@xcite .",
    "unfolded data are compared to a series of theoretical models , including nlo monte carlo generators and bfkl - inspired ones , in the rapidity range @xmath7 .",

    "the differences between the various models , as well as the systematic uncertainties for some points , can be up to factors of 2 or 3 , being the largest at low transverse momenta and large rapidity separations .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the kinematic regime where two jets are separated by a large rapidity separation is where the standard modeling of qcd is expected to encounter more difficulties , and the approximations made in the dglap evolution to break down .",
    "alternative approaches to these evolution equation have been developed , both as effective theories @xcite and as monte carlo generators inspired by ccfm evolution like cascade @xcite or bfkl like hej @xcite .",
    "the regime in which these effects become relevant is unclear , so most of the experimental studies are performed as a function of the rapidity separation between the two jets .    atlas performed an explicit measurement of the number of additional jets in a dijet system , in the two cases when the boundary jets are defined as the two leading jets of the events , and when they are the most forward and backward of the event above a transverse momentum of 20 gev ( an approach inspired by the studies of mueller and navelet @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "an additional requirement is that the average transverse momentum of the two boundary jets should be larger than 50 gev , to be in the fully - efficient region of the jet trigger .",
    "the measurements presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : njetsvsrapidity ] are performed as a function of the dijet rapidity separation , in bins of average transverse momentum of the two boundary jets .",

    "the theory comparison is made with the nlo+ps generator powheg@xcite , interfaced with both pythia and herwig@xcite for the showering , and with hej interfaced with ariadne .",

    "inclusive events have at least two jets passing these criteria ; exclusive events have exactly two jets of this kind . in the inclusive case , each pairwise combination of jets",

    "mueller - navelet jets are the most forward and most backward jet of the event ; so for the second ratio only one combination is taken , and by construction @xmath13 ; however , also @xmath14 is larger or equal than one , since , even if only one combination is taken , the number of events with jets according to the inclusive definition is larger than that of those with exclusive jets . at extreme rapidity separations ,",

    "<S> the two general - purpose detectors of the lhc have measured these observables , and for some of them interesting deviations with respect to the most commonly used theoretical models are observed . </S>"
