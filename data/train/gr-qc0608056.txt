    "in 1917 einstein introduced the cosmological constant into his field equations in order to obtain a static cosmological model since , as is well known , without the cosmological term his field equations admit only non - static solutions . after the discovery of the redshift of galaxies and its explanation as being due to the expansion of the universe , einstein regretted his introduction of the cosmological constant .",
    "recently , there has been much interest in the cosmological term in context of quantum field theories , quantum gravity , super - gravity theories , kaluza - klein theories and the inflationary - universe scenario . shortly after einstein s general theory of relativity weyl , in 1918 , suggested the first so - called unified field theory based on a generalization of riemannian geometry .",
    "in retrospect , it would seem more appropriate to call weyl s theory a geometrized theory of gravitation and electromagnetism ( just as the general theory was a geometrized theory of gravitation only ) , rather than a unified field theory .",
    "it is not quite clear to what extent the two fields have been unified , even though they acquire ( different ) geometrical significances in the same geometry . the theory was never taken seriously because it was based on the concept of non integrability of length transfer , and , as pointed out by einstein , this implies that spectral frequencies of atoms depend on their past histories and therefore have no absolute significance .",
    "nevertheless , weyl s geometry provides an interesting example of non - riemannian connections , and recently folland @xcite has given a global formulation of weyl manifolds thereby clarifying considerably many of weyl s basic ideas .    in 1951",
    "lyra @xcite proposed a modification of riemannian geometry by introducing a gauge function into the structureless manifold , as a result of which the cosmological constant arises naturally from the geometry .",
    "this bears a remarkable resemblance to weyl s geometry .",
    "but in lyra s geometry , unlike weyl s , the connection is metric preserving as in remannian ; in other words , length transfers are integrable .",
    "lyra also introduced the notion of a gauge and in the `` normal '' gauge the curvature scalar in identical to that of weyl .",
    "in consecutive investigations sen @xcite , sen and dunn @xcite proposed a new scalar - tensor theory of gravitation and constructed an analog of the einstein field equations based on lyra s geometry . it is thus possible @xcite to construct a geometrized theory of gravitation and electromagnetism much along the lines of weyl s `` unified '' field theory without , however , the inconvenience of non - integrability length transfer .",
    "+ halford @xcite has pointed out that the constant vector displacement field @xmath1 in lyra s geometry plays the role of cosmological constant @xmath0 in the normal general relativistic treatment .",
    "it is shown by halford @xcite that the scalar - tensor treatment based on lyra s geometry predicts the same effects , within observational limits , as the einstein s theory .",
    "several authors sen and vanstone @xcite , bhamra @xcite , karade and borikar @xcite , kalyanshetti and wagmode @xcite , reddy and innaiah @xcite , beesham @xcite , reddy and venkateswarlu @xcite , soleng @xcite , have studied cosmological models based on lyra s manifold with a constant displacement field vector . however",
    ", this restriction of the displacement field to be constant is merely one of convenience and there is no _ a priori _ reason for it .",
    "beesham @xcite considered frw models with time dependent displacement field .",
    "he has shown that by assuming the energy density of the universe to be equal to its critical value , the models have the @xmath2 geometry .",
    "singh and singh @xcite , singh and desikan @xcite have studied bianchi - type i , iii , kantowaski - sachs and a new class of cosmological models with time dependent displacement field and have made a comparative study of robertson - walker models with constant deceleration parameter in einstein s theory with cosmological term and in the cosmological theory based on lyra s geometry .",
    "soleng @xcite has pointed out that the cosmologies based on lyra s manifold with constant gauge vector @xmath3 will either include a creation field and be equal to hoyle s creation field cosmology @xcite or contain a special vacuum field which together with the gauge vector term may be considered as a cosmological term . in the latter case",
    "the solutions are equal to the general relativistic cosmologies with a cosmological term .",
    "the einstein s field equations are a coupled system of highly nonlinear differential equations and we seek physical solutions to the field equations for their applications in cosmology and astrophysics . in order to solve the field equations we normally assume a form for the matter content or that space - time admits killing vector symmetries @xcite .",
    "solutions to the field equations may also be generated by applying a law of variation for hubble s parameter which was proposed by berman @xcite .",
    "in simplest case the hubble law yields a constant value for the deceleration parameter .",
    "it is worth observing that most of the well - known models of einstein s theory and brans - deke theory with curvature parameter @xmath4 , including inflationary models , are models with constant deceleration parameter . in earlier literature",
    "cosmological models with a constant deceleration parameter have been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "but redshift magnitude test has had a chequered history . during the 1960s and the 1970s ,",
    "it was used to draw very categorical conclusions .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath5 was then claimed to lie between @xmath6 and @xmath7 and thus it was claimed that the universe is decelerating .",
    "today s situation , we feel , is hardly different .",
    "observations ( knop et al .",
    "@xcite ; riess et al . , @xcite ) of type ia supernovae ( sne )",
    "allow to probe the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the main conclusion of these observations is that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "so we can consider the cosmological models with variable cosmological term and deceleration parameter .",
    "the readers are advised to see the papers by vishwakarma and narlikar @xcite and virey et al . @xcite and references therein for a review on the determination of the deceleration parameter from supernovae data .",
    "recently pradhan and otarod @xcite have studied the universe with time dependent deceleration parameter and @xmath0-term in presence of perfect fluid . motivated with the situation discussed above , in this paper , we study a new class of lrs bianchi - i cosmological models in lyra geometry by considering a time dependent deceleration parameter in an expanding universe . this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the metric and the field equations are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we deal with a general solution .",
    "the sections 4 , 5 , and 6 contain the three different cases for the solutions in exponential , polynomial and sinusoidal forms respectively .",
    "finally in section 7 concluding remarks will be given .",
    "we consider lrs bianchi type i space - time @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "we take a perfect fluid form for the energy momentum tensor [ eq2 ] @xmath10 together with co - moving coordinates @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . + the field equations in normal gauge for lyra s manifold , as obtained by sen [ 3 ] are [ eq3 ] @xmath13 where @xmath3 is a time - like displacement field vector defined by @xmath14 and other symbols have their usual meaning as in riemannian geometry . here we want to mention the fact that the ansatz choosing the coordinate system with matter require the vector field happens to be in the required form exactly in the matter comoving coordinates . the essential difference between the cosmological theories based on lyra geometry and the riemannian geometry lies in the fact that constant vector displacement field @xmath15 arises naturally from the concept of gauge in lyra geometry where as cosmological constant @xmath0 was introduced in _ adhoc _",
    "fashion in the usual treatment .    now the field equations can be set up and one obtains @xmath16 @xmath17",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 the energy conservation equation is @xmath20 \\left(\\frac{\\dot a}{a } +   \\frac{2 \\dot b}{b}\\right ) = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath21 . here and in what follows",
    "a prime and a dot indicate partial differentiation with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively . equations ( [ eq4])-([eq7 ] ) are four equations in five unknowns @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for complete determinacy of the system one extra condition is needed .",
    "one way is to use an equation of state .",
    "the other alternative is a mathematical assumption on the space - time and then to discuss the physical nature of the universe . in this paper",
    "we confine ourselves to assume an equation of state @xmath26",
    "equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , after integration , yields @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an arbitrary function of @xmath22 .",
    "equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , with the use of equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , reduces to @xmath29 setting @xmath30 equation ( [ eq11 ] ) yields on integration @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary function of @xmath23 . with the help of equation ( [ eq13 ] ) ,",
