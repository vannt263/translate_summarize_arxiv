    "quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1 dimensions is the simplest nontrivial gauge field theory .",
    "still , it retains some important features of 4dimensional qcd , confinement being the most remarkable . for these reasons",
    "it has been extensively studied in many aspects .",
    "the model is soluble in two limits . for zero mass",
    "it becomes a theory of free bosons @xcite while for vanishing coupling it is a free dirac theory .",
    "both approximations , small and large mass were studied eg . by coleman @xcite .",
    "an approach using perturbation theory in the small mass limit was presented in @xcite .",
    "apart from analytical methods , the schwinger model was also solved on the lattice , eg . by schiller @xcite . another successful technique",

    "front frame quantization .",
    "it was first proposed by susskind @xcite and developed by chang et al .",
    "first application of the light ",
    "front formalizm to the two dimensional schwinger model was performed by brodsky et al . in @xcite .",
    "this formulation opened the possibility to compute energies of the system by numerical methods for any mass parameter @xmath1 .",
    "as the method proved useful in this simple case it was later applied to more complex theories as qcd in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "a well known feature of the massive schwinger model is that for small coupling constant the system may be well approximated by a fermion and antifermion with a linear potential between them @xcite .",
    "linearity of the potential heavily relies on having only one spatial dimension .",
    "due to this fact fermions are confined .",
    "the string tension , which is the proportionality constant between energy end separation of partons , was found eg . in @xcite .",
    "it is also known @xcite that the interaction of largely separated fermion ",
    "antifermion pair is screened due to vacuum polarization .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how above results can be read directly from numerical data obtained in the light ",
    "front quantization .",
    "in particular , we get the linear energy dependence and determine the string tension .",
    "we also study the structure of 4particle bound states which are responsible for the screening . in order to handle the problem of visualizing probability distribution of 4particle state we use inclusive which are widely used rather in the context of scattering .",
    "finally , we demonstrate how two charges at large distances are screened by vacuum polarization .",
    "outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we present the light ",
    "front quantization method of the massive schwinger model . in sect .",
    "3 we show numerical results for masses and construction of wavefunctions . sect .",
    "4 is devoted to considerations in the 2particle sector where the linear potential emerge . in sect .",
    "5 we discuss the structure of bound states with 4particle components responsible for the screening . in sect .",
    "6 we demonstrate that a widely separated @xmath0 pair indeed decays into multi particle state .",

    "our aim is to find eigenvalues and eigenstates of the invariant mass operator @xmath27 .",
    "we diagonalize @xmath28 on eigenspaces of fixed light  front resolution @xmath25 which is possible since @xmath28 and @xmath25 commute .",
    "basis of the fock space consists of states of the form @xmath29 . due to the relation @xmath30 , @xmath25 simultaneously limits parton number @xmath31 and number of partons @xmath32 , hence size of the hilbert space .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 becomes a finite matrix and can be diagonalized numerically .",

    "a wavefunction in momentum space is give by the fourier transform : @xmath48 since @xmath25 is fixed and @xmath49 , the wavefunction depends only on differences of positions , while dependence on one coordinate is trivial .",

    "a priori the eigenvectors of matrix @xmath28 can have components with arbitrary parton numbers .",
    "however , we observe that several lowest mass states are almost exclusively composed of the two particle states .",
    "next , there is a sequence of states in four particle sector . for higher @xmath24",
    "the binding energy at given distance is larger .",

    "[ fig : plots7 ] and [ fig : plots8 ] . in both cases",
    "the function @xmath77 is highly peaked at the origin and vanishes almost exactly elsewhere .",
    "it means that the fermion @xmath13 at @xmath80 forms a pair with an antifermion @xmath14 .",
    "function @xmath72 is zero at the origin .",
    "this is reflection of the pauli exclusion principle . for the lowest energy state in four",
    "particle sector @xmath72 weakly depends on @xmath81 . for higher states it grows faster for small @xmath81 and exhibits oscillatory behavior for larger @xmath81 .",
    "function @xmath74 is peaked at @xmath80 .",
    "this peak is directly related to the peak of @xmath77 .",
    "then , it has maxima approximately at the same positions at which @xmath72 has maxima .",
    "these correspond to an antifermion @xmath14 which forms a pair with the other fermion @xmath13 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath81 is so weak because the two @xmath0 pairs are neutral and interact indirectly only due to the exclusion principle among constituents .",
    "therefore , they can move almost independently .",
    "from above considerations we infer that when a @xmath0 pair is separated by a distance which is large enough , there exist a four particle state composed of two @xmath0 pairs which has smaller energy .",

    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolutions ] .",
    "one can see that for small distance @xmath62 the state remains in the two  particle sector .",
