    "the standard model provides a remarkably successful description of the properties of the quarks , leptons and spin-1 gauge bosons at energy scales of @xmath0  gev and below .",

    "@xmath1  gev , quantum gravitational effects become significant and the standard model must be replaced by a more fundamental theory that incorporates gravity .",
    "it is also possible that the standard model breaks down at some energy scale , @xmath2 , below the planck scale . in this case , the standard model degrees of freedom are no longer adequate for describing the physics above @xmath2 and new physics must enter .",
    "thus , the standard model is not a _ fundamental _ theory ; at best , it is an _ effective field theory _  @xcite . at an energy scale below @xmath2 , the standard model ( with higher - dimension operators to parameterize the new physics at the scale @xmath2 ) provides an extremely good description of all observable phenomena .    in an effective field theory ,",
    "all parameters of the low - energy theory ( _ i.e. _ masses and couplings ) are calculable in terms of parameters of a more fundamental , renormalizable theory that describes physics at the energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "all low - energy couplings and fermion masses are logarithmically sensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , scalar squared - masses are _ quadratically _ sensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "the higgs mass ( at one - loop ) has the following form : [ natural ] m_h^2= ( m_h^2)_0+cg^216 ^ 2 ^ 2 , where @xmath3 is a parameter of the fundamental theory and @xmath4 is a constant , presumably of @xmath5 , which is calculable within the low - energy effective theory . the `` natural '' value for the scalar squared - mass is @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the expectation for @xmath2 is [ tevscale ] ~o(1  tev ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is significantly larger than 1  tev ( often called the hierarchy and naturalness problem in the literature  @xcite ) , then the only way for the higgs mass to be of order the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is to have an `` unnatural '' cancellation between the two terms of .",
    "this seems highly unlikely given that the two terms of have completely different origins .    a viable theoretical framework that incorporates weakly - coupled higgs bosons and satisfies the constraint of is that of `` low - energy '' or `` weak - scale '' supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "in this framework , supersymmetry is used to relate fermion and boson masses and interaction strengths .",
    "since fermion masses are only logarithmically sensitive to @xmath2 , boson masses will exhibit the same logarithmic sensitivity if supersymmetry is exact .",
    "since no supersymmetric partners of standard model particles have yet been found , supersymmetry can not be an exact symmetry of nature .",
    "thus , @xmath2 should be identified with the supersymmetry - breaking scale .",
    "the naturalness constraint of is still relevant , so in the framework of low - energy supersymmetry , the scale of supersymmetry breaking should not be much larger than about 1  tev in order that the naturalness of scalar masses be preserved .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of the standard model would then replace the standard model as the effective field theory of the tev scale .",
    "one advantage of the supersymmetric approach is that the effective low - energy supersymmetric theory _ can _ be valid all the way up to the planck scale , while still being natural !",
    "the unification of the three gauge couplings at an energy scale close to the planck scale , which does not occur in the standard model , is seen to occur in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , and provides an additional motivation for seriously considering the low - energy supersymmetric framework  @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) consists of taking the standard model and adding the corresponding supersymmetric partners .",
    "( for a review of the structure of the mssm , see , refs .  @xcite . ) in addition , the mssm contains two hypercharge @xmath7 higgs doublets ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) , which is the minimal structure for the higgs sector of an anomaly - free supersymmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "the supersymmetric structure of the theory also requires ( at least ) two higgs doublets to generate mass for both `` up''-type and `` down''-type quarks ( and charged leptons ) @xcite .",

    "particles with the same su(3)@xmath28u(1)@xmath29 quantum numbers can mix .",
    "the physical ( mass ) eigenstates are determined from the full interaction lagrangian of the theory .",
    "for example , the physical _ charginos _ [ @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) ] are linear combinations of the charged winos ( @xmath32 ) and charged higgsinos ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , while the physical _ neutralinos _ [ @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) ] are linear combinations of the neutral wino ( @xmath37 ) , bino ( @xmath38 ) and neutral higgsinos ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",

    "in contrast to the standard model , the terms of dimension @xmath47 in the supersymmetric lagrangian do not automatically preserve baryon number ( b ) and lepton number ( l ) . in order to be consistent with the ( approximately ) conserved baryon number and lepton number observed in nature ,",

    ".matter discrete symmetries [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ count ]    even in the absence of a fundamental theory of susy - breaking , one is hard - pressed to regard mssm-124 as a fundamental theory .",
    "for example , no fundamental explanation is provided for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , mssm-124 is not a phenomenologically viable theory over most of its parameter space . among the phenomenological deficiencies",
    "are : ( i ) no conservation of the separate lepton numbers l@xmath64 , l@xmath65 , and l@xmath66 ; ( ii ) unsuppressed flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) @xcite ; and ( iii ) new sources of cp - violation that are inconsistent with the experimental bounds @xcite . as a result , almost the entire mssm-124 parameter space is ruled out ! this theory is viable only at very special `` exceptional '' points of the full parameter space .",
    "a truly minimal ssm does not ( yet ) exist . in the present usage",
    ", the word `` minimal '' in mssm refers to the minimal particle spectrum and the associated r - parity invariance .",
    "the mssm particle content must be supplemented by assumptions about the origin of susy - breaking that lie outside the low - energy domain of the model . moreover",
    ", a comprehensive map of the phenomenologically acceptable region of mssm-124 parameter space does not yet exist .",
    "this presents a formidable challenge to supersymmetric particle searches that must impose some parameter constraints while trying to ensure that the search is as complete as possible .",
    "ultimately , the goal of any supersymmetric particle search is to measure as many of the 124 parameters as is feasible and to determine any additional parameters that would characterize a possible departure from the minimal ssm structure .",
    "there are two general approaches for reducing the parameter freedom of mssm-124 . in the low - energy ( or `` bottom - up '' ) approach",
    ", an attempt is made to elucidate the nature of the exceptional points in the mssm-124 parameter space that are phenomenologically viable .",
    "consider the following two possible choices .",
    "first , one can assume that the squark and slepton squared - mass matrices and the matrix @xmath67-parameters , @xmath68 , are proportional to the @xmath62 unit matrix ( horizontal universality @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , one can simply require that all the aforementioned matrices are flavor diagonal in a basis where the quark and lepton mass matrices are diagonal ( flavor alignment @xcite ) . in these approaches ,",
    "the number of free parameters characterizing the mssm is substantially less than 124 .",
    "moreover , l@xmath64 , l@xmath65 and l@xmath66 are separately conserved , while tree - level fcnc s are automatically absent .",
    "the resulting models are phenomenologically viable , although there is no strong theoretical basis for either approach .    in the high - energy ( or `` top - down '' ) approach , the mssm-124 parameter freedom is reduced by imposing theoretical constraints on the structure of susy - breaking .",
    "it is very difficult ( perhaps impossible ) to construct a model of low - energy supersymmetry where the susy - breaking arises solely as a consequence of the interactions of the particles of the mssm .",
    "a more viable scheme posits a theory in which the fundamental source of susy - breaking originates in a sector that is distinct from the fields that make up the mssm . for lack of a better term",
    ", we will call this new sector the direct susy - breaking ( dsb ) sector .- type ) breaking and fayet - iliopoulos ( or @xmath69-type ) breaking . for additional details , see . ]",
    "the susy - breaking inherent in the dsb - sector is subsequently transmitted to the mssm spectrum by some mechanism .    integrating out the physics associated with the dsb sector , one obtains initial conditions for the mssm parameters at some high energy scale .",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) evolution then allows one to evolve down to the electroweak scale and derive the full mssm particle spectrum .",
    "one bonus of this analysis is that one of the diagonal higgs squared - mass parameters is typically driven negative by the rg - evolution .",
    "thus , electroweak symmetry breaking is generated radiatively , and the resulting electroweak symmetry - breaking scale is intimately tied to the scale of low - energy susy - breaking .",
    "two theoretical scenarios have been examined in detail : gravity - mediated and gauge - mediated susy - breaking . in both these approaches",
    ", supersymmetry is spontaneously broken , in which case a massless goldstone fermion , the _ goldstino _ , arises .",
    "its coupling to a particle and its superpartner is fixed by the supersymmetric goldberger - treiman relation @xcite _ int=-1fj^_g_+h.c . , [ gtrel ] where @xmath70 is the supercurrent , which depends bilinearly on all the fermion ",
    "boson superpartner pairs of the theory and @xmath71 is the spin-1/2 goldstino field ( with spinor index @xmath72 ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath73 is the scale of direct susy - breaking which occurs in the dsb - sector ( typically , @xmath74 ) .",
    "when gravitational effects are included , the goldstino is `` absorbed '' by the _",
    "gravitino _ ( @xmath75 ) , the spin-3/2 partner of the graviton . by this super - higgs mechanism @xcite ,",
    "the goldstino is removed from the physical spectrum and the gravitino acquires a mass ( @xmath76 ) . in models where the gravitino mass is generated at tree - level ( see , , for further discussion ) , one finds : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the helicity @xmath79 components of the gravitino behave approximately like the goldstino , whose couplings to particles and their superpartners are determined by . in particular ,",
    "the goldstino couplings are enhanced by a factor of @xmath80 relative to couplings of gravitational strength .",
    "in contrast , the helicity @xmath81 components of the gravitino always couple with gravitational strength to particles and their superpartners , and thus can be neglected in phenomenological studies .    in many models ,",
    "the dsb - sector is comprised of fields that are completely neutral with respect to the standard model gauge group . in such cases , the dsb - sector is also called the `` hidden sector . ''",
    "the fields of the mssm are said to reside in the `` visible sector , '' and the model is constructed such that no renormalizable tree - level interactions exist between fields of the visible and hidden sectors . a third sector , the so - called `` messenger sector , '' is often employed in models to transmit the susy - breaking from the hidden sector to the visible sector . however , it is also possible to construct models in which the dsb - sector is not strictly hidden and contains fields that are charged with respect to the standard model gauge group .",
    "all particles feel the gravitational force .",
    "in particular , particles of the hidden sector and the visible sector can interact via the exchange of gravitons .",
    "thus , supergravity ( sugra ) models provide a natural mechanism for transmitting the susy - breaking of the hidden sector to the particle spectrum of the mssm . in models of gravity - mediated susy - breaking , planck - scale physics is the messenger of susy - breaking @xcite .    in",
    "the _ minimal _ supergravity ( msugra ) framework @xcite , the soft susy - breaking parameters at the planck scale take a particularly simple form : [ plancksqmasses ] & & * m^2_q * ( ) = * m^2_u * ( ) = * m^2_d * ( ) + & & = * m^2_l * ( ) = * m^2_e * ( ) = m_0 ^ 2 * 1 * , + & & m^2_h_u ( ) = m^2_h_d ( ) = m_0 ^ 2 , + & & * a_f * ( ) = a_0 * y_f*(),=*u , d , e * , where @xmath82 is the @xmath62 identity matrix in generation space .",
    "note that the last condition is equivalent to @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the @xmath62 matrices above respect horizontal universality at the planck scale .",
    "in addition , the gauge couplings and gaugino mass parameters are assumed to unify at some high energy scale , @xmath84 .",
    "( the latter condition is automatic in models of supersymmetric grand unification , where @xmath84 is the unification scale . )",
    "the unification relation [ gunif ] m_1(m_x ) = m_2(m_x ) = m_3(m_x ) = m_1/2 implies that the low - energy gaugino mass parameters ( approximately ) satisfy : [ gauginomassrelation ] m_3 & = & g^2_3g_2 ^ 2 m_23.5m_2 , + m_1 & = & ^2_w m_20.5m_2 .",
    "one can count the number of independent parameters in the msugra framework .",
    "in addition to 18 standard model parameters ( excluding the higgs mass ) , one must specify @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and planck - scale values for @xmath61 and @xmath17-parameters ( denoted by @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) . in principle",
    ", @xmath87 , @xmath89 and @xmath88 can be complex , although in the msugra approach , these parameters are taken ( arbitrarily ) to be real .",
    "renormalization group evolution is used to compute the low - energy values of the msugra parameters , which then fixes all the parameters of the low - energy mssm . in particular , the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( or equivalently , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) can be expressed as a function of the planck - scale supergravity parameters . the simplest procedure is to remove @xmath88 and @xmath89 in favor of @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( the sign of @xmath88 is not fixed in this process ) . in this case , the mssm spectrum and its interaction strengths are determined by five parameters : @xmath85 , @xmath87 , @xmath86 , @xmath93 , and the sign of @xmath88 , in addition to the 18 parameters of the standard model .",
    "the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry - breaking imposes an additional constraint on the possible range of the msugra parameters . in particular",

    "one arranges the scale of the hidden sector susy - breaking such that @xmath95 . in this case , the gravitino mass is of order the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale [ see ] , while its couplings to the mssm fields are extremely weak .",
    "such a gravitino would play no role in supersymmetric phenomenology at colliders .",
    "recently , attention has been given to a class of supergravity models in which does not hold . in models where no tree - level gaugino masses are generated , one finds a model - independent contribution to the gaugino mass whose origin can be traced to the super - conformal ( super - weyl ) anomaly which is common to all supergravity models  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been called _ anomaly - mediated _ susy - breaking ( amsb ) . the gaugino mass parameters ( in the one - loop approximation )",
    "are given by : m_im_3/2 , [ eqanom ] where the @xmath96 are the coefficients of the mssm gauge beta - functions corresponding to the corresponding u(1 ) , su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge groups : @xmath97 .",
    "anomaly - mediated susy - breaking also generates ( approximate ) flavor - diagonal squark and slepton mass matrices .",
    "however , in the mssm this can not be the sole source of susy - breaking in the slepton sector , since the latter yields negative squared - mass contributions for the sleptons .",
    "a possible rpv solution , involving only the superfields of the mssm , has been advocated in      in _ gauge - mediated _ susy - breaking ( gmsb ) , susy - breaking is transmitted to the mssm via gauge forces .",
    "a typical structure of such models involves a hidden sector where supersymmetry is broken , a `` messenger sector '' consisting of particles ( messengers ) with su(3)@xmath28su(2)@xmath28u(1 ) quantum numbers , and the visible sector consisting of the fields of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "the direct coupling of the messengers to the hidden sector generates a susy - breaking spectrum in the messenger sector .",
    "finally , susy - breaking is transmitted to the mssm via the virtual exchange of the messengers .",
    "if this approach is extended to incorporate gravitational phenomena , then supergravity effects will also contribute to susy - breaking .",
    "however , in models of gauge - mediated susy - breaking , one usually chooses the model parameters in such a way that the virtual exchange of the messengers dominates the effects of the direct gravitational interactions between the hidden and visible sectors . in this scenario ,",

    "the simplest models of this type are even more restrictive than msugra , with two fewer degrees of freedom . however , minimal gmsb is not a fully realized model .",
    "the sector of susy - breaking dynamics can be very complex , and no complete gmsb model yet exists that is both simple and compelling .",
    "in the mssm , the higgs sector is a two - higgs - doublet model with higgs self - interactions constrained by supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , in spite of the large number of potential cp - violating phases among the mssm-124 parameters , the tree - level mssm higgs sector is automatically cp - conserving . in particular , unphysical phases can be absorbed into the definition of the higgs fields such that @xmath93 is real and positive . as a result ,",
    "the physical neutral higgs scalars are cp - eigenstates .",

    ". one of the most striking effects of the radiative corrections to the mssm higgs sector is the modification of the upper bound of the light cp - even higgs mass , as first noted in . when @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the _ tree - level _",
    "prediction for @xmath108 corresponds to its theoretical upper bound , @xmath109 . including radiative corrections ,",
    "the theoretical upper bound is increased , primarily because of an incomplete cancellation of the top - quark and top - squark ( stop ) loops ( these effects actually cancel in the exact supersymmetric limit ) .",

    "the condition that the relic density of lsp s constitutes a significant part of the dark matter imposes even further restrictions on the msugra parameter space @xcite .    in more general sugra models , the nature of the lsp need not be so constrained .",
    "one can envision a @xmath186-lsp which has an arbitrary mixture of gaugino and higgsino components by relaxing gaugino mass unification .",
    "a nearly pure higgsino lsp is possible in the region where the ( low - energy ) gaugino majorana mass parameters satisfy @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "the sneutrino ( in particular , the @xmath188 ) can be a viable lsp , although it is unlikely to be a major component of the dark matter @xcite unless the supersymmetric model incorporates some lepton number violation @xcite . in amsb models , yields @xmath189 and @xmath190 , which implies that the lightest chargino pair and neutralino make up a nearly mass - degenerate triplet of winos ; the corresponding lsp is approximately a pure @xmath37 .    in most gmsb models ,",
    "the mass of the gravitino lies in the ev  kev regime .",

    "thus , many models yield large numbers of supersymmetric events characterized by one or more leptons in association with missing energy , with or without hadronic jets .    one signature of particular note is events containing like - sign di - leptons @xcite .",

    "however , exceptions are possible",
    ". in particular , if there is a supersymmetric particle that is just barely heavier than the lsp , then its ( three - body ) decay rate to the lsp will be significantly suppressed and it could be long lived .",

    "becomes possible . for @xmath256",
    ", squarks can be regarded as leptoquarks  @xcite since the following processes are allowed : @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 ( where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are generation labels ) . the same term responsible for the processes displayed above could also generate purely hadronic decays for sleptons and sneutrinos : _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath260 and @xmath261 ( @xmath262 or @xmath263 ) .",
    "if such decays were dominant , then the pair production of sleptons in @xmath143 events would lead to hadronic four - jet events with jet pairs of equal mass @xcite , a signature quite different from the missing energy signals expected in the mssm .",
    "alternatively , @xmath254 could result in substantial branching fractions for @xmath264 and @xmath265 decays .",
    "sneutrino pair production would then yield events containing four charged leptons with two lepton pairs of equal mass .",
    "low - energy supersymmetry remains the most elegant solution to the naturalness and hierarchy problems , while providing a possible link to planck scale physics and the unification of particle physics and gravity .",
    "nevertheless , the origin of the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms and the details of their structure remain a mystery .",
    "there are many theoretical ideas , but we still can not be certain which region of the mssm-124 parameter space ( or some non - minimal extension thereof ) is the one favored by nature .",
    "the key theoretical breakthroughs will surely require experimental guidance and input .",
    "thus , we must rely on experiments at future colliders to uncover evidence for low - energy supersymmetry .",
    "canonical supersymmetric signatures at future colliders are well analyzed and understood .",
    "much of the recent efforts have been directed at trying to develop strategies for precision measurements to establish the underlying supersymmetric structure of the interactions and to distinguish among models .",
    "however , we are far from understanding all possible facets of mssm-124 parameter space ( even restricted to those regions that are phenomenologically viable ) . for example , the phenomenological implications of the potentially new cp - violating phases that can arise in the mssm and its consequences for collider physics have only recently begun to attract attention . moreover ,",
    "the variety of possible non - minimal models of low - energy supersymmetry presents additional challenges to experimenters who plan on searching for supersymmetry at future colliders .",
    "if supersymmetry is discovered , it will provide a plethora of experimental signals and theoretical analyses .",
    "the variety of phenomenological manifestations and parameters of supersymmetry suggest that many years of experimental and theoretical work will be required before it will be possible to determine the precise nature of supersymmetry - breaking and the implications for a more fundamental theory of particle interactions .",
    "i would like to gratefully acknowledge the collaboration of jack gunion in preparing sections 5 and 6 of this paper .",
