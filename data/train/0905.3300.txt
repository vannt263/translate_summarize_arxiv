    "the advent of superconducting f - doped lafeaso stimulates a world - wide campaign for more and better fe - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "more superconductors were obtained by replacing la by other lanthanides or partly substituting f for o , and higher phase - transition temperatures ( @xmath0 ) were achieved in some of them @xcite .",
    "furthermore , more series of fe - based superconductors were found , including bafe2as2 series and lifeas series @xcite .",
    "the highest @xmath0 in these series reaches 55 - 56 k in the case of doped smfeaso @xcite .",
    "various explorations have been performed to elucidate their magnetic orders , electronic electronic structures , superconductivity , and so on @xcite .",
    "recently , superconductivity was found even in tetragonal fese samples under high pressure and @xmath1 fese phases with se vacancies @xcite .",
    "very recently , srfeasf was made superconducting by la and co doping @xcite .",
    "the fese system is interesting because its fese layer is similar to the feas layer of the feas - based materials : @xmath2feaso series ( @xmath2 : rare earth elements ) , @xmath3fe2as2 series ( @xmath3 : alkaline - earth elements ) , lifeas series , and srfeasf series .",
    "in addition to the feas layers , there are @xmath2o layers in @xmath2feaso series , @xmath3 layers in @xmath3fe2as2 series , li layers in lifeas series , and srf layers in srfeasf series , but there is nothing else besides the fese layers for the fese systems .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to investigate the magnetic orders , electronic structures , and magnetic properties of the tetragonal fese phases ( or distorted phases of them ) .    in this article",
    "we use an full - potential density - functional - theory method to study various magnetic orders and their effects on the electronic structures of the fese .",
    "we suppose checkerboard antiferromagnetic order for the spins of the fe layer of the tetragonal phase and striped antiferromagnetic orders for those of the symmetry - broken structures , and perform total - energy and force optimization to determine the structural and magnetic parameters .",
    "then , we investigate the corresponding electronic structures and magnetic property of them .",
    "our calculated result means that the striped antiferromagnetic order is favorable for the spins of the fe layer , which is consistent with main known experimental data .",
    "we also discuss the reduction of the fe magnetic moment by quantum many - body effects .",
    "more detailed results are presented in the following .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", we give our computational detail . in the third section",
    ", we present our main dft calculated results , including optimized magnetic structures and corresponding electronic density of states and energy bands . in the fourth section , we discuss spin interactions and many - body effects on the fe magnetic moments .",
    "finally , we present our main conclusion in the fifth section .",
    "our calculations are performed by using a full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method within the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite , as implemented in the vienna package wien2k @xcite . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )",
    "is used for the exchange and correlation potentials @xcite .",
    "we take the 3@xmath4 and 4@xmath5 states of fe and the 4@xmath5 and 4@xmath6 states of se as valence states , and the 3@xmath6 states of fe and 3@xmath4 states of se are treated as semicore states .",
    "the core states include all the lower states .",
    "the core states are treated in terms of radial dirac equation and thus the full relativistic effect is included .",
    "for the valence and semicore states , the relativistic effect is calculated under the scalar approximation , with spin - orbit interaction being neglected @xcite .",
    "the radii of fe and se muffin - tin spheres are 2.05 and 2.00 a.u .",
    ", respectively . to get more accurate results , we take @xmath7=9.0 and make the angular expansion up to l=10 in the muffin - tin spheres .",
    "we use 1000 k points in the calculations . for different magnetic orders the k points in the first brillouin zone",
    "are chosen differently because of the different symmetry .",
    "the self - consistent calculations are controlled by the charge density , and the convergence standard is that the difference between input charge density and output one is less than 0.00005 per unit cell .",
    "we show the unit cell of the tetragonal fese ( pbo structure ) in fig .",
    "1a . it is a layered structure , in which fe atom occupies 2a position and se atom 2c position .",
    "there are six possible magnetic configurations for the fe ions if the tetrahedral fese structure is allowed to distort into orthorhombic structures .",
    "1e shows the first brillouin zone with the representative points and lines .",
    "the fe moments in the fe plane can be arranged to form ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic orders .",
    "the afm orders can be checkerboard - like ( fig .",
    "1c ) or striped ( fig .",
    "for the successive \\{001}planes , the fe moments can couple ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically . as a result",
    ", we have four different antiferromagnets , namely ( a ) checkerboard - fm , ( b ) checkerboard - af , ( c ) stripe - fm , and ( d ) stripe - af .",
    "in addition , when we force fe moments in the fe plane have fm order , the self - consistent calculations yield zero moments for the fe moments , which means that fm order is unstable for fese , independent of the interlayer spin arrangements . therefore",
    ", we can actually construct five magnetic orders for this system .",
    ".the magnetic order , the relative total energy per formula unit ( @xmath8 in mev , with the lowest stripe - fm set as reference ) , the magnetic moment in the fe muffin - tin sphere ( @xmath9 in @xmath10 ) , and the internal se position parameter @xmath11 of the two striped antiferromagnetic orders and the two checkerboard ones .",
    "the results of the nonmagnetic order are presented for comparison . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the parameters in our calculations are taken from the experimental values .",
    "we use @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the positions of se atoms are optimized fully , and the force of se atom is made less than 2 mry / a.u .",
    "calculated results of total energy , magnetic moment , and se position parameter are summarized in table i. it makes little difference in total energy to arrange interlayer fe moments in fm or af order .",
    "the total energy results reveal that the intralayer fe - fe interaction is strong and the interlayer interaction weak .",
    "actually , the striped arrangement of the fe moments lowers the total energy of the fese layer approximately by 70 mev with respect to the checkerboard arrangement . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - magnetic order is 154 mev higher than the lowest striped af order .",
    "therefore , the striped af spin order is the magnetic ground state in the fese layer , but the actual interlayer magnetic interaction is too weak for any density - functional - theory calculation to determine .",
    "the moment in the fe muffin - tin sphere is about 1.8@xmath10 for the two checkerboard orders , and about 2.0@xmath10 for the two striped orders .",
    "the total moment for one fe atom is estimated to be a little larger for the striped af orders .",
    "for the striped af orders , the se position parameter remains almost the same when the interlayer spin coupling is changed from fm to af . because it is impossible to distinguish between fm and af spin alignment in the @xmath14 direction by density - functional - theory calculation , we present calculated results for both fm and af arrangement in the @xmath14 direction in the following .",
    "we present the spin - dependent density - of states ( dos ) of the fese in the two striped af orders in fig .",
    "2 . there is no energy gap near the fermi levels and therefore the fese for each af order shows a metal feature .",
    "the fe atom has different crystalline environment for different magnetic orders , and thus its states are reformed in different ways .",
    "it can be seen that the main peaks occupy the states in the energy window from -2.2 ev to -1.5 ev .",
    "almost all the partial dos of fe atom comes from the 3d sates , and the dos of se atom consists mainly of the p states .",
    "we present the electronic energy bands of the fese in the two striped af orders in fig .",
    "the plots look like lines , but consist of hollow circles .",
    "we choose the @xmath15 points uniformly for convenient comparison .",
    "the circle diameter is proportional to the fe1 spin - up or fe1 spin - down atomic character of the band at that @xmath15 point .",
    "the dispersion along the @xmath14 direction is much stronger than those in other similar fe - based materials .",
    "this can be attributed to the short distance between the successive fe layers .",
    "it can be seen that the d states of fe play a key role for all the magnetic structures . for the stripe magnetic structures we can find the electrons and holes along the x-@xmath16-y line , which is very important to achieving superconductivity in doped cases or under appropriate pressures .",
    "in order to further investigate the magnetic moment , we use the following afm heisenberg spin model to describe the spin properties of the fe atoms in the striped afm phase .",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 is quantum spin operator for site @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the exchange coupling constants between the two spins at sites @xmath19 and @xmath21 . for the striped afm phase ,",
    "the nearest coupling constant in the @xmath22 direction is @xmath23 , and that in the @xmath24 direction @xmath25 . for the tetrahedral phase",
    ", we should have @xmath26 , but for the striped phase we have @xmath27 because the crystalline distortion in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "we limit non - zero exchange coupling constants up to the next nearest neighboring spins , @xmath29 . for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "our dft calculation yields @xmath32mev , @xmath33mev , and @xmath34mev .",
    "these means @xmath35mev and @xmath36mev .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath25 comes from the superexchange through the two nearest se atoms and @xmath29 from that through the one nearest se atom , and as a result , we should have @xmath37 , which supports our dft results .",
    "we treat the spin hamiltonian ( 1 ) with the above parameters with spin wave theory@xcite . as usual , the average spin for zero temperature , @xmath38 , can be given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the spin value of the fe atom in the fese and @xmath41 the correction due to quantum many - body effects .",
    "presented in fig .",
    "4 are our calculated results for @xmath38 and @xmath41 as functions of the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath38 decreases with decreasing @xmath42 , getting to zero at @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , the striped afm structure is not the magnetic ground state of the fese any more if @xmath29 is smaller than @xmath44 . for real samples of the fese",
    ", one should have the parameter relations @xmath45 and @xmath46 is small but finite , and therefore the experimental spin value is small compared to the dft value @xmath40 .",
    "in summary , we have used the full - potential density - functional - theory method to study various magnetic orders and their effects on the electronic structures of the fese .",
    "we find that , for the spins of the single fe layer , the striped antiferromagnetic orders with the broken symmetry are more favorable in total energy than the checkerboard antiferromagnetic orders with tetragonal symmetry , and the inter - layer magnetic interaction is very weak .",
    "then , we investigate the corresponding electronic structures and magnetic property of the distorted phases with the striped antiferromagnetic orders .",
    "our calculated result that the striped antiferromagnetic order is favorable for the spins of the fe layer is consistent with main known experimental data .",
    "we also present our calculated spin coupling constants and conclude that the reduction of the fe magnetic moment is caused by quantum many - body effects .",
    "these results are useful to understand the structural , magnetic , and electronic properties of fese , and may have some helpful implications to other feas - based materials .",
