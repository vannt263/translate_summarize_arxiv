    "in several metallurgical processes such as , for example , the levitation melting and cold - crucible , where the induction heating is used , the surface of liquid metal is subject to ac magnetic field .",
    "in such a way , the metal can be not only molten but also evaporated provided that the heating power is high enough ( @xcite ) .",
    "induction heating is accompanied with a pinch effect , which can significantly deform the surface of liquid metal .",
    "when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied , surface sometimes becomes asymmetric and even strongly irregular ( @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon is of primary importance for the induction heating of liquid metals because it may have an adverse effect on the heating efficiency and eventually limit the power density the liquid metal can dissipate . such a surface instability has been observed first by @xcite on a circular layer of gallium in a mid - frequency ac magnetic field .",
    "analogous instability was studied also by @xcite on the free surface of ingasn melt in the annulus placed under a ring - like circular coil and fed by an alternating current with the frequency in the range of @xmath3 as the current amplitude exceeds a certain critical value , which depends mainly on the annulus width , an initially flat surface acquires a static wavy deformation . at a higher critical current ,",
    "the deformation rapidly increases and becomes unsteady .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , who observe only static deformations , @xcite find a circular sessile drop of ingasn melt first to squeeze radially with various shape oscillations to set in as the strength of a @xmath4 ac magnetic field is gradually increased . in the former experiment ,",
    "the surface of liquid metal was exposed to the air and , thus , heavily oxidised that constrained its motion . in the latter experiment ,",
    "oxidation was prevented by covering the drop by a diluted hcl solution .",
    "later on @xcite found static shape deformations when the drop was constrained in a horizontal gap between two parallel plates .",
    "irregular static surface shapes have been observed also by @xcite on a layer of pbsn alloy covering the bottom of a cylindrical container . the metal layer , which was constrained by the lateral walls of the container and heavily oxidised at the top , broke up revealing the bottom of the container as the strength of a @xmath5 ac magnetic field exceeded a certain critical value .",
    "the authors also attempted to model this process numerically using a surface integral equation derived from green s third identity .",
    "this approach , however , is not applicable to thin sheets , for which the double layer contribution vanishes . in a subsequent paper ,",
    "@xcite devised a simplified electrotechnical model , which provided a rough estimate of equilibrium shapes .",
    "a simple theoretical model for this type of instability was introduced by @xcite , who analysed the linear stability of the edge of liquid metal layer , which was treated as a perfectly conducting thin liquid sheet in a transverse ac magnetic field .",
    "this allowed the authors to determine the wavenumber of the most dangerous perturbation and the critical field strength at which the instability develops in a reasonable agreement with the observations of @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "an energy variation principle is derived for the equilibrium shapes that develop from the edge pinch instability of flat liquid metal drops , which are modelled as thin perfectly conducting liquid sheets .",
    "firstly , the stability of a circular disk is analysed with respect to small - amplitude harmonic edge perturbations .",
    "analytical solution shows that the edge deformations with the azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath0 start to grow as the magnetic bond number exceeds the critical threshold @xmath1 the most unstable is @xmath2 mode , which corresponds to an elliptical deformation .",
    "secondly , strongly deformed equilibrium shapes are modelled numerically by minimising the associated energy .",
    "the electromagnetic problem is formulated in terms of the surface integral equation for the scalar magnetic potential , which is solved numerically on an unstructured triangular mesh covering the surface of the drop .",
    "the edge instability is found to result in the equilibrium shapes of either two- @xmath6 or three - fold @xmath7 rotational symmetry depending on the initial perturbation and the magnetic field strength .",
    "although the associated energy of @xmath8 shapes is higher than that of @xmath2 ones at the same magnetic field strength , both shapes are separated by a positive energy barrier .",
    "this , however , is not the case for equilibrium shapes of higher order symmetries .",
    "although these shapes can be obtained numerically , they turn out to be unstable with respect to small amplitude perturbations of two- or threefold rotational symmetries , which make them fall back to one of the two basic states .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in @xmath9[sec : probform ] , the problem is formulated and the energy variation principle derived in terms of the integral of the scalar magnetic potential over the drop surface .",
    "this principle is applied in @xmath9[sec : anal ] to obtain an analytical solution for the stability of a circular disk with respect to small - amplitude harmonic edge perturbations .",
    "specific mathematical details of the solution are given in appendix [ sec : apx1 ] .",
    "in @xmath9[sec : num ] , numerical method is described and validated against the previous analytical solution .",
    "numerical results are presented in @xmath9[sec : num ] .",
    "the paper is concluded with a summary and discussion in @xmath9[sec : sum ] .",
    "sketch to the formulation of problem . ]    consider a drop of liquid metal with the characteristic size @xmath10 electrical conductivity @xmath11 surface tension @xmath12 and density @xmath13 submitted to an ac magnetic field with the spatial amplitude distribution @xmath14 , as shown in figure [ cap : sketch ] .",
    "the ac frequency @xmath15 is assumed so high that the penetration depth of the magnetic field into the drop @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the vacuum permeability , is negligible with respect to @xmath18 in this perfect conductor approximation , the magnetic field is tangential to the drop surface @xmath19 @xmath20 and the electromagnetic force effectively acts on the surface as the time - averaged magnetic pressure , @xmath21 equilibrium shape of the drop is determined by the normal stress balance @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the hydrostatic and capillary pressures , respectively , @xmath25 is the outward surface normal and @xmath26 is the gravitational acceleration . multiplying ( [ eq : pblnc ] ) by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a virtual displacement field conserving the volume , and integrating over @xmath19 we obtain@xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the virtual works done by the gravitational , surface tension and magnetic forces , respectively . since all of these forces , including the magnetic one in the perfect conductor approximation , are conservative , the corresponding works can be expressed as the variations of the associated potential energies . using the divergence theorem to change from the surface to volume integrals , and taking into account the incompressibility constraint @xmath33 as well as the lagrangian variation @xmath34",
    "we obtain @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the associated potential energies .",
    "the minus sign at the last integral is due to the integration over the outer volume @xmath39 for an equilibrium shape , ( [ eq : wblnc ] ) implies @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the total associated energy .",
    "this derivation of the energy variation principle appears more straightforward than the original one by @xcite .",
    "equilibrium shape of the drop corresponds to a stationary point of @xmath42 which , as usual , has to be a minimum for the equilibrium to be stable ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , the external magnetic field @xmath43 is assumed homogeneous , which supposes the drop to be small compared to the inductor generating the field .",
    "this allows us to express the magnetic energy ( [ eq : em ] ) by an integral over the drop surface as follows .",
    "the total magnetic field is a superposition of the external and induced fields @xmath44 outside the drop , we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the scalar potential of the induced magnetic field . then ( [ eq : em ] ) can be represented as@xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a remote surface enclosing the drop at @xmath50 the part of the integral over the drop surface @xmath51 vanishes because of the boundary condition ( [ eq : bn ] ) .",
    "since the induced magnetic field is supposed to fall off at large distances @xmath52 as the dipole field with @xmath53 the last integral converges to a non - zero value .",
    "the other contribution to the magnetic energy is @xmath54 where the first integral represents the energy of the external magnetic field , which is constant , and thus negligible , however , formally it is infinite .",
    "therefore , retaining only the second term in ( [ eq : e0 ] ) , we obtain@xmath55 where the integral is taken over the drop surface @xmath51 with the outward normal direction .",
    "now it remains to evaluate the integral in ( [ eq : e1 ] ) , which is determined by the dipole component of the induced field@xmath56 where @xmath57 is the dipole moment of the drop and @xmath58 is the surface current density .",
    "the latter is related to the magnetic field by ampere s integral current law , which applied to a small surface element results in @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the full scalar magnetic potential including also that of homogeneous external field @xmath61 substituting these expressions into ( [ eq : e1 ] ) , after some algebra we obtain@xmath62 the integral above can be represented as @xmath63 where the second term , which is related to the energy of homogeneous external magnetic inside the drop of fixed volume , is constant and , thus , negligible again . by the same argument , @xmath46 in ( [ eq : e01 ] ) can be substituted by @xmath64 then the magnetic energy ( [ eq : em01 ] ) , apart from a constant contribution of the external field , can be written in terms of @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is given by ( [ eq : e11 ] ) .",
    "there are two alternatives how to find the magnetic potential .",
    "first , the solenoidality constraint @xmath68 for a free - space magnetic field @xmath69 results in@xmath70 which together with the boundary conditions , @xmath71 governs @xmath65 outside the drop .",
    "this formulation is used in @xmath9 [ sec : anal ] for analytical treatment of small amplitude deformations of a circular disk by using a singular taylor - series - type expansion around the basic state .",
    "second , for efficient numerical solution , instead of ( [ eq : lapl ] ) , which has to be solved in the whole space outside the drop , it is more advantageous to use biot  savart law @xmath72 where the prime denotes the integration point",
    ". then the boundary condition ( [ eq : bn ] ) applied to ( [ eq : bs ] ) results in the surface integral equation defining @xmath65 on @xmath51@xmath73 which has to be solved for a given shape of the drop to obtain the surface distribution of @xmath74 which , in turn , defines the magnetic energy ( [ eq : e11 ] ) .",
    "then equilibrium shape is found by minimising the total associated energy ( [ eq : enrg ] ) .    a model of liquid layer confined in the gap between two horizontal plates in a transverse ac magnetic field .",
    "]      in the following , we focus on the case of a thin drop confined in a horizontal gap between to parallel insulating plates , as shown in figure [ cap : layer ] .",
    "the drop is modelled by a perfectly conducting liquid sheet with the virtual displacements constrained to the plane of the sheet .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath43 is perpendicular to the sheet .",
    "the surface enclosing the sheet consists of the top and bottom parts @xmath75 and @xmath76 both with the same area @xmath77 but opposite normals .",
    "taking into account also that the potential of the induced field changes the sign discontinuously by crossing the sheet , contributions from both surfaces in ( [ eq : e11 ] ) are the same .",
    "this results in a factor of two at the front of the integrals in ( [ eq : e11 ] ) and ( [ eq : inteq ] ) when the integration is carried out only over the upper part of the sheet .",
    "subsequently , we identify @xmath77 and @xmath65 with the top surface and the potential at that surface , respectively .",
    "note that the contribution of the transverse homogeneous field , whose potential ( [ eq : psi - b0 ] ) is constant along the sheet , vanishes in ( [ eq : e11 ] ) . for the layer of fixed thickness ,",
    "gravitational energy is constant and , consequently , irrelevant in the variation of the total energy . due to the volume conservation and fixed thickness",
    ", the horizontal area @xmath77 is fixed , too .",
    "then the variation of surface is caused only by the stretching of the perimeter @xmath78 which determines the effective edge area @xmath79 and the corresponding surface energy @xmath80 where the arclength @xmath81 over the edge is assumed to be fixed similar to the layer thickness itself ( see figure [ cap : layer ] ) .",
    "subsequently , all variables are non - dimensionalised by choosing @xmath10 @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 as the length , magnetic field , potential and energy scales , respectively . then the dimensionless associated energy , which comprises a capillary contribution of the edge and the magnetic energy , can be written as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the magnetic bond number based on the amplitude of ac magnetic field .",
    "note that there is no difference between the induced and full magnetic field potentials in ( [ eq : nrg - nd ] ) when that of homogeneous field ( [ eq : psi - b0 ] ) is set to be zero along the sheet by a proper choice of additive constant .",
    "actually , this difference is irrelevant because the contribution of homogeneous field in ( [ eq : psi - b0 ] ) , as discussed in the previous section , is constant for incompressible liquid . for a flat sheet , ( [ eq : inteq ] ) takes the following dimensionless form : @xmath87 for no electric current ( [ eq : j ] ) to cross the edge @xmath88 @xmath89 is required , which implies @xmath90=const , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the tangent and normal vectors to the edge , respectively , and @xmath25 is the normal vector to the sheet@xmath93 as discussed above , we can set @xmath94 which ensures a zero potential for the homogeneous external field in the plane of the sheet .",
    "here the approach developed above will be applied to analyse the stability of a circular liquid disk with the radius @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a small perturbation with the amplitude @xmath97and the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath98 and @xmath99 is a higher - order small correction to be determined later on .",

    "the second term above is obtained similarly to the first one by applying @xmath122 to ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) , as described in the last paragraph of appendix [ sec : apx1 ] , which yields @xmath123}{(\\eta^{2}+\\xi^{2})^{3}}.\\label{eq : psi03}\\ ] ] at the disk surface , we have @xmath124 it is important to note that ( [ eq : psi1m - r ] ) and ( [ eq : psi20-r ] ) are singular at @xmath125 which is the edge of the unperturbed disk . at the same time , the edge condition ( [ eq : ecnd ] ) implies the potential to be regular ( zero ) at the actual edge of the deformed disk .",
    "this implies that the solution above can be regularised by representing it in the radial coordinate @xmath126 stretched with the radius of the deformed disk . using the substitution @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the radius perturbation , and expanding the solution in power series of @xmath129 up to the second order in @xmath113 we obtain a solution of the same asymptotic accuracy , which is free of edge singularities @xmath130 where @xmath131 and    @xmath132.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then the magnetic energy term in ( [ eq : nrg - nd ] ) can be evaluated up the first order in @xmath99 as @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the magnetic energies of circular disk and its leading - order perturbation defined by @xmath136r\\,\\d r=4(m-1).\\label{eq : e1m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the surface energy term in ( [ eq : nrg - nd ] ) is evaluated as @xmath137 then the total energy variation is @xmath138 note that there is no energy variation for @xmath139 mode , which corresponds to the shift of the disk as whole .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this study , we have numerically modelled strongly deformed equilibrium shapes of a flat liquid metal drop subject to a transverse high - frequency ac magnetic field .",
    "the drop was treated as a thin liquid layer confined in a horizontal gap between two parallel insulating plates .",
    "ac frequency was assumed high so that the magnetic field was effectively expelled from the drop by the skin effect .",
    "equilibrium shapes of the drop were found by using a variational principle for the associated energy involving the surface and magnetic contributions . using biot ",
    "savart law , the associated electromagnetic problem was formulated in terms of a surface integral equation for the scalar magnetic potential .",
    "this equation was solved numerically on an unstructured triangular mesh covering the surface of the drop .",
    "numerical method was validated against analytical solution for the stability of circular disk with respect to small - amplitude azimuthally harmonic edge perturbations . according to the analytical solution",
    ", the edge deformations with the azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath0 start to grow on circular disk as the magnetic bond number exceeds the critical threshold values @xmath220 the most unstable is @xmath2 mode , which corresponds to an elliptical deformation at the critical bond number @xmath221 .",
    "this result agrees surprisingly well with the experimental findings of @xcite for a drop of galinstan ( gainsn eutectic alloy ) with the diameter of @xmath222 confined in a horizontal gap between two parallel glass plates separated by @xmath223 the drop was submitted to the ac magnetic field generated by a 10-winding @xmath224 coil with the inner and outer radii of @xmath225 and @xmath226 respectively , which were roughly in the plane of the drop . for the ac frequency of @xmath227 which was the highest one applied in the experiment , an originally circular disk became elliptical as the effective current in the coil exceeded @xmath228 this corresponds to the r.m.s .",
    "magnetic field in the centre of the coil @xmath229 which yields the critical bond number @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the surface tension of galinstan and the effective arclength of the edge @xmath232 is approximated by a half circle .",
    "the critical currents are higher at lower frequencies and appear to saturate as the frequency is increased , which is consistent with the saturation of the electromagnetic force in the perfect conductor limit .",
    "shapes with a rough three - fold rotational symmetry are observed above the critical current @xmath233 which corresponds to @xmath234 this is by about a third greater than the theoretical value @xmath235 for @xmath8 mode .",
    "note that also the shapes with a four - fold rotational symmetry are observed in the experiment though the numerical simulation showed them to be unstable . these discrepancies between the theory and experiment",
    "may be due to two effects .",
    "first , the size of the drop is comparable to that of the coil , which makes the applied magnetic field non - uniform over the drop radius .",
    "second , to prevent the oxidation the drop is submerged in a 6% solution of hcl , which may affect the surface tension . given all these experimental uncertainties and deviations from the idealised theoretical model",
    ", the agreement of the instability threshold for the @xmath2 mode seems too good and perhaps even incidental .",
    "note that the critical bond number resulting from the energy variation approach is by a factor of @xmath236 greater than that supplied by our previous linear stability analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "there seem to be no obvious errors in either approach except for the factor of @xmath237 missed in the final expression for the time - averaged force @xmath238 above equation ( 24 ) of @xcite .",
    "this factor taken into account results in @xmath239 which increases the actual difference from @xmath240 to @xmath236 times .",
    "the only questionable point is the determination of electromagnetic force on the edge , where the magnetic field becomes singular , by the integration of maxwell stress tensor over a small cylindrical surface enclosing the edge ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the local magnetic field at the edge used in the integration is entirely due to the currents induced in the sheet . using ampere s force law",
    ", it can be shown that such an approach accounts only for the interaction between the induced currents while it misses out any interaction of the induced and external currents .",
    "this is because the latter act via the external magnetic field , which is opposite to the induced one , but not taken into account by the local field distribution . as a result ,",
    "the force on the edge is overestimated and , consequently , the magnetic field strength necessary for the instability underestimated .",
    "obviously , the semi - infinite sheet model used by @xcite is not able in principle to account for the interaction with external magnetic field , which requires the consideration of finite size system .",
    "this is implied also by the energy variation approach , which does not work for a semi - infinite sheet model . on the one hand ,",
    "the energy of the magnetic field , which falls off as @xmath241 from the edge , diverges for semi - infinite sheet . on the other hand",
    ", this energy does not vary with the variation of the edge position because this variation is equivalent to the offset of the origin of coordinate system .",
    "this makes the force on the edge of semi - infinite sheet undetermined .",
    "such ambiguities do not arise when the energy variation approach is applied to finite - size drops , as done in this study .",
    "moreover , difficulties due to the edge singularity disappear altogether when smooth drops are considered , which , however , significantly increases the numerical complexity of the problem .",
    "i would like to thank yves fautrelle for stimulating discussions .",
    "in the oblate spheroidal coordinates , ( [ eq : lapl ] ) for the azimuthal mode @xmath242 of the potential defined by ( [ eq : psi1 ] ) takes the form @xmath243 the potential perturbation , which is supposed to vanish with the distance from the disk @xmath244 is related with the radius perturbation by ( [ eq : disc - edge ] ) , which now reads as @xmath245 although ( [ eq : lapl - psi1 m ] ) admits the variable separation , such a solution is complicated by the edge singularity ( [ eq : ecnd - m ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , a compact analytical solution can be found similarly to the construction of spherical solid harmonics from the fundamental solution of the laplace equation ( @xcite ) as follows .",
    "firstly , note that if @xmath65 is a solution of the laplace equation and @xmath246 is a constant vector , then @xmath247 is a solution , too .",
    "secondly , if @xmath65 satisfies a homogeneous boundary condition and @xmath246 is directed along the boundary , then @xmath247 satisfies that boundary condition , too .",
    "thirdly , the operator @xmath248 changes the radial dependence of @xmath65 from @xmath249 to @xmath250 while the azimuthal dependence is changed from the mode @xmath242 to @xmath251 algebra becomes particularly simple when @xmath246 is taken in the complex form as @xmath252 then each application of @xmath248 is accompanied by the multiplication with @xmath253 thus , the solution for @xmath139 is obtained straightforwardly from the axisymmetric base state ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) as @xmath254 higher azimuthal modes can be obtained similarly as @xmath255 where @xmath256 is an axisymmetric solution satisfying ( [ eq : lapl - psi1 m ] ) . the edge condition ( [ eq : ecnd - m ] )",
    "@xmath257 yields @xmath258 for @xmath259 moreover , the perturbation vanishes far away from the disk when @xmath260 along the whole disk , where @xmath261 is a constant",
    ". then the corresponding axisymmetric solution of ( [ eq : lapl - psi1 m ] ) can be written as@xmath262 where @xmath263 and @xmath264 are the legendre polynomials and functions of the second kind , respectively ( @xcite ) ; the expansion coefficients are found as @xmath265 where@xmath266 then the solution for the perturbation amplitude can be written as @xmath267 using the operator@xmath268 which is defined by @xmath269 where @xmath270 and @xmath271 is the complex conjugate of @xmath272 the calculation of ( [ eq : psi1m - dsk ] ) is algebraically complicated but can be done by the computer algebra system mathematica ( @xcite ) , which requires considerable computer resources and practically can be carried out only for @xmath273 but this suffices to deduce the general solution ( [ eq : psi1 m ] ) .",
    "the axisymmetric solution ( [ eq : psi03 ] ) with @xmath274 edge singularity can be obtained in a similar way directly from the axisymmetric base solution ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) by applying @xmath275 this operator is equivalent to @xmath276 because it represents the transversal part of the laplace operator while ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) satisfies the laplace equation .",
