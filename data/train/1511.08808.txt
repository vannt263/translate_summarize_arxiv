    "over the last decade , dedicated deep field programs with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ have identified more than 10000 candidate galaxies with a redshift beyond @xmath8 , based on their photometric colors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although a number of these objects have been successfully confirmed out to @xmath9 through near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , progress in characterizing the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these galaxies and identifying their physical properties has been slow .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that spectroscopy and deep , high - resolution photometry in the rest - frame optical wavelengths , shifted to observed mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths for sources at @xmath8 , will not be available until the launch of the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst)_.    despite these challenges a number of noteworthy results have emerged on the observational properties of the @xmath8 galaxy population .",
    "first of all , the typical rest - frame uv colors of galaxies from @xmath4 to @xmath10 have been meticulously characterized through their _ hst _ photometry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , photometric studies using the _ spitzer space telescope _ have obtained the first constraints on the shape of the rest - frame optical sed of @xmath8 galaxies @xcite . in particular ,",
    "observational evidence has emerged for the presence of strong optical nebular emission lines , such as h@xmath0 and [ ] , in the typical @xmath8 source @xcite .    while the rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) of h@xmath0 in typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 - 2 range from 10 - 200 @xcite , a large fraction of sources between @xmath4 - 8 have inferred h@xmath0 and [ ] ews in the range @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively @xcite .",
    "these measured ews are higher than predicted by models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the origin of these ubiquitous high - ew lines is still unclear and proves an ongoing challenge in our current understanding of the physical properties of high - redshift galaxies .    while the interpretation of the [ ] line strength is complicated by the dependence on , for example , the gas density in the regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the h@xmath0 line strength is known to be stable against variations in density or temperature and therefore should be a stable tracer of the star formation @xcite .",

    "@xcite argue that one probable explanation for the high ratio of h@xmath0 flux to @xmath7 flux they observe could be due to a preference for young ages amongst their selected sources , as essentially all sources with spectroscopic redshifts that they consider show ly@xmath0 emission . while this speculation by @xcite is reasonable , the actual impact of considering only those sources showing ly@xmath0 emission is unclear ; it requires testing based on a much larger and unbiased sample of @xmath4 galaxies and one also benefitting from even deeper photometric observations .        in this paper",
    "we revisit the use of h@xmath0 as a sfr indicator in the redshift range @xmath1 - 5.0 , considering both expanded spectroscopic and photometric - redshift selections . in doing so ,",
    "we leverage even deeper _ spitzer_/irac coverage from the s - candels survey @xcite and deep @xmath15-band data @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to make a state of the art assessment on the origin of high - ew h@xmath0 emission in typical high redshift sources .",
    "we search for correlations of the h@xmath0 ew with a large number of observational and physical properties , and we look for possible biases in the results of spectroscopic samples relative to photometric - redshift - selected samples and vice versa .",
    "we use the h@xmath0 fluxes to derive to estimate specific star formation rates from galaxies and compare these to ssfrs derived from the @xmath7-continuum fluxes in an effort to constrain the burstiness of the star formation history .",
    "finally , we will discuss the implications of our results for the so - called main sequence of star - forming galaxies and the @xmath4 - 8 sfr functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : observations ] we describe the observations we use and how we define our spectroscopic and photometric - redshift - selected samples , while we derive the observational and physical properties of our samples in  [ sec : prop ] . in  [ sec : sfrha ] we derive h@xmath0-based sfrs , which we compare with uv - based sfrs and we discuss the potential origin of the discrepancy we find between the different probes . in  [ sec : mainseq ] we establish the main sequence of star - forming galaxies from our h@xmath0 measurements , while in  [ sec : sfrfunc ] we translate our findings into sfr functions . finally , we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] .    throughout this paper",

    "a combination of the @xmath33 and @xmath31 images is used as the detection image ( weighted by the square root of the inverse variance ) and total fluxes are measured in kron apertures .",
    "furthermore , we include the photometry in the _ spitzer_/irac bands at 5.8 and 8.0@xmath25 m from the @xcite photometric catalogs , who make use of the goods spitzer 3rd data release .",
    "we obtain the deepest possible photometry for the 3.6@xmath25 m and 4.5@xmath25 m bands by leveraging the imaging from the _ spitzer _ extended deep survey ( seds : * ? ? ?",

    "similar to the procedure used for the public 3d-_hst_/candels catalogs described in @xcite we obtain photometry with the multi - resolution object photometry on galaxy observations ( mophongo ) code described in @xcite , which provides an automated cleaning procedure for deblending the sources of interest and their neighboring sources . in short",
    "mophongo creates model fluxes for all sources in a @xmath34 radius by psf - matching all detected galaxies in the @xmath31 band to the irac image psf and simultaneous fitting the normalizations of the modeled galaxies to match the observed irac image .",
    "cleaned images are created by subtracting the model fluxes of all neighboring sources from the observed image .",
    "we measure the flux in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bands from the cleaned images in 20 diameter apertures and we apply a @xmath37 aperture correction based on the ratio of the flux enclosed in the photometric aperture in the _ hst _ image ( before convolution ) to the irac model ( after convolution ) of the source of interest .    in order to obtain good constraints on the rest - frame optical stellar light , both shortwards and longwards of the h@xmath0 emission line , we require good signal - to - noise @xmath15-band photometry . for the goods - n field",

    "are included that are also part of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we quote numbers for the separate selections with these spectroscopically - confirmed sources included . however , when quoting measured quantities for the combined sample , we only count a given source once ( even if in both samples ) .",

    "recently , the possibility of a different dust calibration for high - redshift sources was discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors argue that high redshift sources likely have lower metallicities and younger ages than the local starburst galaxies used in the empirical @xcite calibration .",
    "the @xcite calibration implicitly assumes a dust - free uv - continuum slope of the galaxy of @xmath148 , consistent with solar metallicity and ages of a few hundred myr .",

    "these physical properties result in bluer intrinsic uv - continuum slopes and therefore the dust reddening of the uv - continuum slope could be underestimated when assuming the @xcite calibration .    following the arguments above , the systemic offset between uv and h@xmath0 based sfr indicators in our @xmath4 sample",
    "could be explained by an underestimate of our dust - correction due to the implicit assumption of @xmath148 .",

    "[ fig : irx_beta ] )    in conclusion , the first high - resolution fir / submm observations taken by alma would indicate that the dust attenuation law is closer to that found for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the ambiguity in the dust - correction of typical high - redshift uv - selected galaxies outlined in figure [ fig : irx_beta ] has significant implications for the interpretation of the high h@xmath0 ews and h@xmath0 sfrs derived in this work . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_newcal ] we show the h@xmath0 and uv based sfrs , when applying two different dust corrections .",
    "the first ( _ left panel _ ) adopts a @xmath171 prescription . by construction",
    ", this produces an excellent match between h@xmath0 and uv based sfrs ( and assumes an intrinsic uv - continuum slope @xmath172 ) . in this case",
    ", the high - ew nebular emission lines found in high - redshift galaxies are in part the result of relatively high levels of dust - obscured star formation in combination with a similar dust attenuation between stars and the nebular light .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig : sfr_newcal ] uses @xmath173 corresponding to a smc - type dust - correction for an intrinsic uv - continuum slope @xmath148 , similar as that implicitly assumed for the @xcite relation . we find a linear slope 1.1 from the tabulated extinction values of the smc by @xcite .",
    "the resulting low levels of dust obscuration imply that , even for similar levels of attenuation between nebular and stellar light , the h@xmath0 sfrs are @xmath122 dex in the spectroscopic and @xmath174 dex in the photometric redshift sample above what we would expect for the total amount of star - formation derived from the dust - corrected uv light . while the samples of individual galaxies with high resolution , high signal - to - noise constraints on the fir light are still small , these results have significant consequences if correct .",
    "this provides us with the motivation to explore other mechanisms for recovering high @xmath175 ratios .                            in the previous section we investigated the effect of different dust calibrations on the @xmath176 ratio of @xmath4 uv - selected galaxy samples . while it is possible to reconcile h@xmath0 and uv based sfr estimates , using the @xcite relations and assuming @xmath93 and dust corrections slightly above what is predicted by the @xcite relation , it is not clear that such a dust law is supported by the observations of @xmath177 galaxies .",
    "the first direct high - resolution dust - continuum measurements of uv - selected high - redshift galaxies suggest that the typical dust content of these galaxies is significantly lower than this ( see figure [ fig : irx_beta ] ) . if future observations give similar results  implying more of an smc dust law",
    " our estimated sfrs using h@xmath0 would be systematically higher than using the @xmath7 light . here",
    ", we will investigate how different star - formation histories can play a role in the derived sfrs when using the locally derived @xcite relations .",
    "one possible explanation for the high @xmath178 ratios we derive in  [ sec : sfrs ] would be that the galaxies we examine are all predominantly young , i.e. , such that the h@xmath0-based sfrs are much larger than @xmath7-based sfrs ( which saturate at @xmath65100 myr ) .",
    "however , it is possible that these galaxies are much younger , or perhaps that galaxies undergo regular bursts of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which would give them the appearance of very young systems .",
    "this would boost the h@xmath0 flux , which is predominantly generated by short - lived ( @xmath610 myr ) o - stars , with respect the observed uv light , which is produced by o- and b - stars on a somewhat longer timescale ( @xmath65100 myr ) .",
    "this is the hypothesis that @xcite favour for explaining the high @xmath179 in the sample they observe .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_comp ] we show sfr@xmath180 as a function of sfr@xmath181 for both our spectroscopic sample ( left ) and our photometric sample ( right ) . since the majority of the sources in the left panel show ly@xmath0 in emission",
    ", one might suppose this population of sources could be biased towards starbursting systems relative to samples which are photometric - redshift - selected .",
    "however , we find little difference in the median @xmath176 ratio of our spectroscopic and our photometric sample . moreover , a subsample of sources with stellar masses above our mass completeness limit of @xmath182 gives a comparable median @xmath176 ratio to that of the entire photometric sample .",
    "these findings argue against supposing that very young ( @xmath610 myr ) starburst ages drive the systematic offsets we observe between h@xmath0 and uv sfrs .    to gain further insight we show the _ specific _ sfr@xmath180 as a function of the specific sfr@xmath181 in figure [ fig : ssfr_comp ] , again assuming a @xcite dust law and @xmath93 .",
    "the two ssfr estimates correlate strongly over @xmath652 dex in ssfr and we find a constant offset between the h@xmath0 and uv probes of @xmath147 dex . for young galaxies that are formed in a single burst of star - formation we would expect the discrepancy between ssfr@xmath180 and ssfr@xmath181 to decrease with decreasing ssfr@xmath180 . for reference",
    "we include a single stellar population ( ssp ) track ( rose line ) that demonstrates the rapid evolution of the @xmath183 ratio of this stellar population with age .",
    "a burst of star formation is expected to show enhanced h@xmath0 for @xmath655 myr , but we would expect many sources with ages @xmath18410 myr after the burst below the one to one relation . comparing this model with our observations ,",
    "we see no clear trend in favor of young ages .    to test this scenario",
    "further we run a monte - carlo simulation , which we consider a population of galaxies with bursty star - formation histories . to reproduce the properties in our sample we randomly draw from the distribution of derived stellar masses for our observed galaxy sample and populate each galaxy with bursts of mass @xmath185 distributed linearly in time with a typical time interval @xmath186 . for each burst",
    "we add a ssp model obtained from the starburst99 models @xcite with the corresponding age to the total spectral energy distribution of the simulated source .",
    "we derive @xmath187 and @xmath96 from the final sed using the @xcite relations . because our observed galaxy sample is limited by the @xmath31 band flux , we assume that the galaxy population can be modeled as an sfr@xmath188-limited sample ( assuming sfr@xmath188 scales linearly with @xmath189 through eq .",
    "[ eq : kennicutt_uv ] ) .",
    "therefore , we impose a @xmath187 lower - limit on our simulated galaxy population of 5 @xmath190 .",
    "we assign observational errors to the simulated datapoints , using the observed uncertainties in the derived sfrs . using these simulations we investigate what parameters of @xmath185 and @xmath186",
    "can roughly reproduce a galaxy population with a similarly high @xmath176 ratio when assuming the @xcite relations as the typical source in our observed galaxy samples .",
    "figure [ fig : bursts ] shows two such simulations that produce a large number of sources with @xmath191 . to reproduce the observed galaxy distribution we find that we typically need high burst masses of @xmath192 , to reproduce the generally high ssfrs , and reasonably short burst intervals of @xmath193 that generate high h@xmath0 fluxes .",
    "while roughly half of the galaxies in our simulation have @xmath191 , our simulations also show a rather large tail of relatively low h@xmath0 ssfr galaxies , i.e. @xmath194 of the simulated galaxy distributions in the left panel of figure [ fig : bursts ] have @xmath195 .",
    "this is in contrast to the observed galaxies in our large photometric sample where @xmath196 of the sources have upper limits in @xmath197 and could therefore populate this low - ssfr tail .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that bursty star - formation histories predict at least twice as many galaxies with @xmath198 as are seen in the observations .",
    "the implication is that the star formation histories of galaxies are considerably more smooth than in the toy model we consider above and that bursty star - formation histories do not provide a resolution for the tension between the h@xmath0 and uv - based sfrs .",
    "these results are in agreement with simulated star - formation histories which predict that burstiness is mostly present in low mass ( @xmath199 ) galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in  [ sec : origin_bursty ] we describe how the distribution of h@xmath0 and uv - based ssfrs disfavors bursty star formation histories .",
    "however , a smoothly rising star - formation history can also affect the @xmath176 ratio simply because the uv flux probes the time - averaged sfr over a @xmath65100 myr time window .",
    "as the sfr for rising star - formation histories is lower at earlier times in a @xmath65100 myr time window , the sfr inferred from the @xmath7 light would be lower than the instantaneous sfr .",
    "@xcite tabulate the values of sfr / l@xmath200 as a function of galaxy age for different star formation histories ( see their table 6 ) . using their tabulated values , an exponentially rising star formation history ( @xmath201 ) results in a @xmath202 dex higher sfr / l@xmath200 ratio for a galaxy of 100 myr compared to a constant star - formation history . assuming h@xmath0 is a good tracer of the instantaneous sfr we estimate that rising star formation histories can reasonably result in a @xmath203 dex offset @xmath204 ratio .",
    "similar to the scenario of bursty star - formation histories , rising star - formation histories can work well in combination with a @xcite dust correction to explain the values of @xmath197 and @xmath205 in our @xmath4 galaxy sample .",
    "however , if these galaxies prefer a smc - type dust correction such as suggested by e.g. @xcite , one can not explain the offset in the derived @xmath176 values just invoking rising star - formation histories .",
