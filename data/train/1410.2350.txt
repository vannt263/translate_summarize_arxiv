    "for a long time researchers in configurations have neglected the difference between combinatorial and geometric configurations of points and lines . in the nineteenth century",
    "it was either tacitly assumed that these concepts coincide or the emphasis was on geometric existence of configurations and the two well - known combinatorial configurations @xmath0 and @xmath1 were automatically excluded from consideration . on the other hand , graph - theoretical approach advocated by a series of papers by h. gropp @xcite identified the concept of configuration with a combinatorial configuration and the problem of existence of the corresponding geometric configuration reduced to the problem of drawing the configuration .",
    "two kinds of questions can be considered in this context : _ is a given combinatorial configuration geometric ? _ and _ for which @xmath2 do there exist geometric configurations @xmath3 ? _",
    "it was realized quite early by h. schrter @xcite that among the ten @xmath4 configurations , exactly one , that we call _ anti - desargues configuration _ , is not geometric .",

    "he proved existence for all but a finite number of values @xmath7 @xcite . j. bokowski and l. schewe @xcite resolved four previously unknown cases , and j. bokowski and v. pilaud @xcite resolved another three open cases leaving only @xmath9 , and @xmath10 open .",
    "f. levi @xcite introduced the notion of pseudolines and showed that the combinatorial configurations @xmath0 and @xmath1 cannod be realized with pseudoline arrangements in the projective plane .",
    "b. grnbaum was the first to observe a fundamental difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 configurations and the anti - desargues configuration .",
    "namely , the latter can be realized as a pseudoline arrangement in the projective plane .",
    "the notion of _ topological configuration _ was born .",
    "j. bokowski and his coworkers were able to apply modern methods of computational synthetic geometry to study the existence or nonexistence of topological configurations @xcite .",
    "b. grnbaum , j. bokowski , and l. schewe @xcite investigated the problem of existence of topological @xmath8 configurations and showed that topological configurations exist if and only if @xmath11 . recently",
    "j. bokowski and r. strausz @xcite associated to each topological configuration a map on a surface that they call a _ manifold associated to the topological configuration _ and thus enabled the definition of equivalence of two topological configurations .",
    "namely , topological configurations are distinct in a well - defined sense if and only if the associated maps are distinct .    in this paper",
    "we first generalize the notion of a pseudoline arrangement to the notion of a _ quasiline arrangement _ by relaxing the condition that two pseudolines meet exactly once , and we define a subclass of quasiline arrangements that we call _ monotone _ ( section 4 ) .",
    "we also generalize well - known tools from pseudoline arrangements such as sweeps , wiring diagrams , and allowable sequences of permutations .",
    "it is known that every pseudoline arrangement can be represented by a wiring diagram and conversely , every wiring diagram can be viewed as a pseudoline arrangement ; see j.  e. goodman @xcite .",
    "we show that every monotone quasiline arrangement can be represented by a generalized wiring diagram that is in turn also a monotone quasiline arrangement ( sections 5 and 6 ) . in this respect",
    "the class of monotone quasiline arrangements is in some sense the weakest generalization of the class of pseudoline arrangements .    in section 7",
    "we introduce a generalization of topological configurations that we call _ ( monotone ) quasi - topological configurations _ by allowing the set of lines to form a ( monotone ) quasiline arrangement instead of a pseudoline arrangement . in section 8",
    "we show that every combinatorial incidence structure , in particular every combinatorial configuration , can be realized as a monotone quasi - topological incidence structure .",
    "moreover , we show that any monotone quasi - topological configuration such that the underlying quasiline arrangement has no digons , is topologically equivalent to a polygonal monotone quasi - topological configuration with no bends ( arcs connecting two vertices of the arrangement are all straight lines ) .",
    "finally , the concept of a map associated with a topological configuration can be extended to the quasi - topological case ( section 9 ) .",
