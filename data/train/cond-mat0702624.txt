    "it has been recognized that orbital degree of freedom plays important roles in determination of physical properties , such as colossal magneto - resistance and complex ordered phases of manganites ,  @xcite and exotic magnetism in @xmath2-electron systems .",
    "@xcite from experimental and theoretical studies of such systems , it is revealed that magnetism in multi - orbital systems has a rich variety . in recent years , effects of orbital degree of freedom on superconductivity",
    "have also been discussed theoretically for several materials ,  @xcite and it has been found that orbital degree of freedom is important , e.g. , for determination of pairing symmetry in a system . in particular , orbital degree of freedom probably plays a role in triplet superconductivity of sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4 ,  @xcite in which fermi surfaces are composed of @xmath5 orbitals .    to understand the effects of orbital degree of freedom on superconductivity , it is still important to gain a definite knowledge on those in a relatively simple model such as a hubbard model for two orbitals with the same dispersion , although , at present , it is difficult to find direct relevance of such a simple model to actual materials .",
    "for such a purpose , superconductivity in two - orbital hubbard models has been studied by a mean - field theory  @xcite and by a dynamical mean - field theory .  @xcite these studies have revealed that an @xmath0-wave spin - triplet state , which satisfies the pauli principle by composing an orbital state of a pair antisymmetrically , is a candidate for a ground state .",
    "this fact is in sharp contrast to a single - orbital model in which pairing states with even parity in the wavenumber space , such as an @xmath0-wave state , should be spin - singlet ones due to the pauli principle within states with even frequency dependence .",
    "note that odd - frequency states are hard to be realized in ordinary cases .",
    "in addition , in a two - orbital system , it is also possible to realize odd - parity spin - singlet states .",
    "thus , the variety of pairing states in a two - orbital model is much large .",
    "however , in the above studies , possibility of superconductivity other than the @xmath0-wave state is not considered . in particular , within the standard dynamical mean - field theory , i.e. , in infinite spatial dimensions , we can not deal with spatial dependence of a pairing state .",
    "thus it is desirable to study superconductivity in a multi - orbital model on a finite - dimensional lattice and determine the most plausible candidates for pairing symmetry of superconductivity .    in this paper , we investigate possible superconducting states of a two - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice by applying fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation .",
    "the flex approximation has been extended to multi - orbital models .",
    "@xcite we classify superconducting states by spin states , orbital states , and representations of tetragonal symmetry .",
    "we also discuss pairing symmetry in other models which are equivalent to the two - orbital hubbard model .",
    "in particular , we find that pairing states with a finite total momentum like the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state ,  @xcite even without a magnetic field , are possible in a system with two fermi - surfaces .",

    "however , the wavenumber dependence of the anomalous self - energy is the same among the equivalent states . from the calculated results for the @xmath0-orbital model , we find that the @xmath195-wave spin - triplet orbital-@xmath108 state appears in the @xmath1-orbital model , and the @xmath128-wave spin - triplet orbital-@xmath108 state appears in the @xmath22-orbital model .",
    "the @xmath1-wave spin - singlet orbital-@xmath108 state appears both in the @xmath1-orbital and the @xmath22-orbital models .    here",
    "we discuss another model for @xmath0 orbitals with two fermi - surfaces . under the transformation",
    "@xmath196 with @xmath35 , or equivalently @xmath197 , the dispersion in eq .   changes as @xmath198 , while the onsite terms in eq .   are invariant .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-orbital model changes to the model described by eq .   with the dispersion @xmath199 by this transformation .",
    "in such a two - fermi - surface system , we expect superconducting states with the finite total momentum @xmath200 like the fflo state by the following reason . in ordinary cases ,",
    "such a superconducting state with a finite total momentum @xmath133 is hard to be realized , since the electron on the fermi surface with the wavevector @xmath127 has to pair with the electron with @xmath201 , but it is off the fermi surface unless @xmath127 satisfies conditions depending on @xmath133 and the structure of the fermi surface . on the other hand in the model with two fermi - surfaces ,",
    "when the electron with @xmath127 is on a fermi surface , the electron with @xmath202 is always on the other fermi surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : fs ] .",
    "fermi surfaces ( solid curves ) for the dispersion @xmath199 for @xmath136 . a pair carrying the total momentum @xmath200",
    "is composed of electrons denoted by closed circles on the different fermi surfaces .",
    ", width=283 ]    thus , superconducting states with the total momentum @xmath200 is naturally expected in the model with two fermi - surfaces , where @xmath200 connects centers of these fermi surfaces .    indeed , under the transformation @xmath197 , an anomalous green s function for a zero - total - momentum state changes as @xmath203 where @xmath204 denotes the anomalous green s function for a pairing state with the total momentum @xmath200 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath205 and @xmath206 change to @xmath205 and @xmath207 , respectively , i.e. , these anomalous green s functions are corresponding to pairing states with zero total momentum .",
    "thus , by this transformation , the orbital - antiparallel superconducting states ( orbital-@xmath86 and -@xmath108 states ) change to those with the finite total momentum @xmath200 , while the orbital - parallel states ( orbital-@xmath87 and -@xmath105 states ) remain those with zero total momentum . concerning the susceptibilities , @xmath208 transforms to @xmath209 for @xmath210 , @xmath105 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 , while the other susceptibilities are unchanged .",
    "then , the antiferromagnetic transition temperatures are unchanged .",
    "thus , from the calculated results for the @xmath0-orbital model , we obtain @xmath0-wave spin - triplet and @xmath1-wave spin - singlet states with the finite total momentum @xmath200 , even without a magnetic field , in the model with two fermi - surfaces which locate around @xmath213 and @xmath214 . at temperatures lower than the transition temperatures ,",
    "a superconducting state may coexist with an antiferromagnetic ( spin density wave ) state .",
    "a superconducting state with the total momentum @xmath200 may be stabilized further by coexisting with a spin density wave with @xmath200 ,  @xcite and it is an interesting future problem .",
    "note also that a model for @xmath27 and @xmath28 orbitals with @xmath215 , in which fermi surfaces locate around @xmath216 and @xmath217 , is equivalent to the @xmath1-orbital model with @xmath218 .",
    "we can show this equivalence by applying the transformation @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "thus , we also obtain superconducting states with the total momentum @xmath221 in the model with @xmath215 .",
    "this conclusion also applies to a model for @xmath222 and @xmath223 orbitals with @xmath224 .",
    "we have studied a two - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice . in this model , we have considered orbitals with @xmath0-orbital symmetry . in such a multi - orbital system ,",
    "even - parity spin - triplet states and odd - parity spin - singlet states are allowed even within states with even frequency dependence .",
    "indeed , we have found that the @xmath0-wave spin - triplet orbital - antisymmetric state and the @xmath1-wave spin - singlet orbital - antisymmetric state naturally appear within a fluctuation exchange approximation .",
    "tendencies toward a @xmath0-wave spin - triplet state have been found also in similar two - orbital models on infinite dimensional lattices by using a dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "@xcite this fact indicates that tendencies toward @xmath0-wave spin - triplet states are common to two - orbital models irrespective of dimensionality .",
    "we have also discussed pairing symmetry in equivalent models which can be described by the two - orbital hubbard model .",
    "the equivalent models with orbital symmetry other than @xmath0-orbital one require special conditions , e.g. , @xmath225 for the @xmath1-orbital model , and may be unrealistic .",
    "however , we believe that these models provide an interesting view point to discuss and determine pairing symmetry in multi - orbital systems .",
    "note also that , in a realistic model such as a model for @xmath1 orbitals with @xmath226 , orbital states of a pair mix in general , and then , @xmath127 dependence of the anomalous self - energy is not that of an irreducible representation of a system .    finally , we have discussed models with two fermi - surfaces . in such multi - fermi - surface systems",
    ", we naturally expect a superconducting state with a finite total momentum like the fflo state .",
    "indeed , we have shown that the superconducting states found in the @xmath0-orbital model are corresponding to pairing states with a finite total momentum , even without a magnetic field , in a model with two fermi - surfaces .",
    "although such a system with multi - fermi - surfaces with the same structure is unrealistic , we expect that such exotic states will be realized also in realistic models with multi - fermi - surfaces whose centers locate around different @xmath127 points with similar , but not exactly the same , structures .",
