    "<S> we analyze the gaps in the excitation spectrum of a haldane chain with single - ion anisotropy in a staggered field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the gap along the direction of the field increases at a faster rate than the others , while its spectral weight decreases , being transferred to a two - magnon continuum .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 75.10.jm ; 75.50.-y    in recent times the preparation of a new class of magnetic materials of the general formula ( r@xmath0y@xmath1)@xmath2banio@xmath3 , where r is one of the magnetic rare - earth ions , has arisen a new theoretical interest for the study of integer - spin haldane chains in a _ staggered _ magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the reference compound y@xmath4banio@xmath3 @xcite is one of the best examples of a magnetic material with a singlet ground state and a spin gap which has been interpreted in the framework of the haldane conjecture @xcite , according to which integer - spin chains have disordered ground state separated by a gap from a degenerate triplet of excitations . in all these materials </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the ni ions are arranged along linear chains ( the a - axis of their orthorhombic structure ) with a relatively large in - chain antiferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath5 ) and negligible inter - chain coupling . </S>",
    "<S> when partially or totally substituted to the yttrium , the magnetic r ions get positioned between neighboring ni chains and are weakly coupled to them . below a certain nel temperature @xmath6 ( typically : 16 k@xmath7 k ) they order antiferromagnetically . </S>",
    "<S> this has the effect of imposing an effective staggered ( and commensurate ) field on the ni chains , whose intensity can be indirectly controlled by varying the temperature below @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a phenomenological approach to the study of these compounds has been first presented in @xcite , where the authors propose a simple mean field model , in which the bare magnetization curve for the ni sublattice is assumed in the form of the staggered magnetization of a single s=1 spin chain , with the effective staggered field proportional to the magnetization of the r ions . the so obtained magnetization curve as function of the magnetic field is in good agreement with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the staggered field is expected to partially lift the degeneracy of the haldane triplet , leading to different spin gaps in the longitudinal ( i.e. parallel to the field ) and transverse channels . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , up to our knowledge there is only one experiment @xcite , analyzing spin - polarized inelastic neutron scattering on nd@xmath2banio@xmath3 crystals , which yields a clear evidence for the longitudinal mode . in this experiment </S>",
    "<S> it is found that at @xmath8 the value as well as the intensity of the transverse and the longitudinal modes are practically equal , as in the case of an isolated haldane chain . to be precise </S>",
    "<S> , the resolution of the equipment is high enough to resolve two slightly different peaks in the spectral density , resulting from a very weak single - ion anisotropy along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath9 , the two excitations clearly separate , with both gaps increasing as the temperature is lowered ( the effective staggered field is increased ) , but with two different rates . </S>",
    "<S> not only the longitudinal gap has a much slower increase but also its weight seems to be suppressed below @xmath9 , contrary to what happens to the transverse mode whose weight is not affected by the magnetic order . + a theoretical approach to isotropic integer - spin chains in a staggered magnetic field has been first considered in @xcite , starting from the familiar mapping @xcite of the heisenberg model onto a nonlinear @xmath10-model ( nl@xmath10 m ) effective lagrangian , that describes the continuum limit , low - energy physics of the heisenberg chain . </S>",
    "<S> what the authors discuss very accurately is actually a related and somewhat more phenomenological model in which the strict nl@xmath10 m constraint is softened , then replacing the original nl@xmath10 m with a theory of the ginzburg - landau type parametrized by an adequate set of adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> some recent very accurate numerical studies @xcite , based on an extensive density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) analysis of an s=1 heisenberg chain in a staggered field , have revealed a significant discrepancy with the above mentioned theoretical approach , from which it differs in the high field regime and especially as far the longitudinal channel concerns . </S>",
    "<S> this has led also the authors of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to question the validity of the nl@xmath10 m approach .    </S>",
    "<S> this problem has been solved in @xcite , where it has been shown that an accurate treatment of the nl@xmath10 m does indeed lead to an excellent agreement between the analytical and the dmrg results . </S>",
    "<S> we will review this treatment in some detail below , while applying it to the case in which the hamiltonian contains also a single - ion anisotropy term . </S>",
    "<S> let us now recall only its main features </S>",
    "<S> . in this approach the nl@xmath10 m constraint is not softened , but enforced consistently at each level of approximation . in the theory </S>",
    "<S> there is then just a single free parameter , which is assumed to be the ( zero - field ) haldane gap and taken from the dmrg data . </S>",
    "<S> also , a consistent scheme of calculation of the propagators and their analytical structure is developed , which shows remarkable differences between the physical properties of the transverse and the longitudinal channels , already at the tree - level of a loop expansion . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the transverse propagators has only two simple poles so that the theory is purely bosonic , with the spectral weight completely exhausted by this magnon excitation . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the transverse gap @xmath11 coincides with the haldane gap . on the contrary , the longitudinal propagator has a much richer structure . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical structure factor has again two well - defined poles corresponding to single - particle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> however they are now weighted by a prefactor which steadily decreases as the staggered field is increased . the spectral weight which is lost from the poles </S>",
    "<S> gets transferred to a multi - particle continuum , which starts from a two - magnon threshold @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we are no longer in the range of applicability of the so - called single mode approximation ( sma ) which establishes a relation between the ( longitudinal ) susceptibility and the gap @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> once the continuum is taken into account , the agreement between the nl@xmath10 m and the dmrg results become remarkable . </S>",
    "<S> let us finally mention that this theoretical scenario has also been proposed @xcite to explain recent experimental data on csnicl@xmath14 @xcite which were not well described by the nl@xmath10 m on isolated spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> + keeping in mind the structure of the ( r@xmath0y@xmath1)@xmath2banio@xmath3 compounds , our microscopic starting point is the hamiltonian @xmath15 that describes an antiferromagnetic s=1 heisenberg chain with a single - ion anisotropy term along the chain z - axis , in a staggered magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath16 and at the end we will distinguish between the cases in which the field is parallel and perpendicular to the anisotropy axis .    </S>",
    "<S> we start analyzing this model by mapping the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hstagg ] ) onto a nl@xmath10 m , by making the well known haldane ansatz @xmath17 with @xmath18 @xmath19 representing the slowly - varying local staggered magnetization and @xmath20 the local generator of angular momentum . in the low - energy continuum limit </S>",

    "<S> the longitudinal gap is lower than the transverse one at zero field . as a function of @xmath74 the former increases at a faster rate than the latter , thus resulting in a level crossing at @xmath130 , as it is shown in the inset of fig.1(a ) . </S>",

    "<S> there is a crossing of levels with the gap @xmath146 becoming larger than @xmath148 as shown in the inset of fig.2(b ) . in both cases , towards saturation </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal gap @xmath146 goes to a value about twice that of the transverse modes @xmath147 , @xmath148 , which become approximately equal . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , though surviving up to saturation , the longitudinal mode has a strongly field - dependent strength : as the field increases the spectral weight that is lost from the pole gets transferred to the two - magnon continuum .    in conclusion , we have analyzed the effect of a staggered magnetic field on a @xmath150 haldane chain with single - ion anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the zero - field splitting of the haldane triplet due to the anisotropy term gets enhanced by the presence of the field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as the field is increased , the longitudinal mode has a spectral weight that decreases quite fast and is transferred to a continuum , which has a two - magnon threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that this seems to be consistent with recent neutron scattering experiments on quasi - one - dimensional compounds @xcite . </S>"
