    "the availability of short - time approximations having fast asymptotic convergence @xcite warrants a closer look to the monte carlo implementation of the resulting lie - trotter products . the superior convergence of path - integral methods employing such short - time approximations is achieved under the assumption that the integration against all path variables is performed in an exact fashion . in practical applications , this is never the case , except for low - dimensional problems .",
    "the efficiency of the methods suffers from the slow convergence of monte carlo integration",
    ". indeed , if the convergence order of a certain technique is @xmath0 , then the computational cost to achieve a given error @xmath1 , as measured by the number of calls to the potential function , has the form @xcite @xmath2 assuming that the monte carlo samples are independent .",
    "this formula demonstrates that we can not defeat the slow convergence of the monte carlo simulation by indefinitely improving the convergence order .    in practical applications , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) represents a very optimistic evaluation , because one must deal with the additional problem of build - up of correlation among path variables , as the number of variables increases @xcite .",
    "thus , only a small group of path variables can be updated in an efficient fashion at a time .",
    "significant research has gone into the problem of diminishing the correlation between path variables and ensuring a more efficient sampling .",
    "techniques such as the staging method @xcite , the threading algorithm @xcite , the bisection method @xcite , the multigrid technique @xcite , and the normal mode and fourier approaches @xcite can significantly decrease the correlation times in path integral monte carlo simulations .",
    "a recent technique developed in ref .",
    ", which is called the fast sampling algorithm , builds upon some special properties of the so - called lvy - ciesielski representation of the feynman - kac formula @xcite .",
    "the technique can be regarded as part of the random series @xcite ( in the continuous form ) or normal mode ( in the discrete form ) approaches to path integration . in the present work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the technique is capable of reducing the computational time necessary to achieve a prescribed statistical efficiency from @xmath3 calls to the potential function ( scaling that is valid for most normal mode representations ) to @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath5 represents the number of path variables .    in section  ii",
    ", we analyze the computational cost of the metropolis _ et al _ algorithm @xcite for high dimensional systems , from the point of view of statistical efficiency .",
    "we present both mathematical and numerical arguments to justify the finding that updating particles one at a time is statistically at least as efficient as using all - particle moves .",
    "the most important cases where updating particles or path variables one at a time results in important computational savings are i ) for classical systems , the case where the computational time for the whole potential increases linearly with the computational time necessary to update only one particle and ii ) for path integral simulations , the case where the path variables can be grouped in independent random vectors .    in section  iii , we study the statistical efficiency of the metropolis _ et al _ sampler for random series as well as for the normal mode implementation of lie - trotter products . we conclude that the lvy - ciesielski representation is superior in both cases , allowing for a reduction in the computational cost of @xmath6 , by comparison with most normal mode implementations .",
    "the reader must realize that the fast sampling algorithm is not really a sampling technique .",
    "rather , it is a property of the lvy - ciesielski representation and can only be utilized for path integrals .",
    "similarly , the fast computation of paths is also a property of the lvy - ciesielski series , rather than a technique .",
    "it enables the computation of paths in @xmath4 operations instead of @xmath3 , the number necessary for most other normal mode implementations .",
    "it is true , starting from coalson s fourier - like normal mode approach @xcite , one can still construct the paths in a time proportional to @xmath4 , by using fast sine - fourier transform .",
    "this has been observed by mielke and truhlar @xcite .",
    "however , constructing a fast sampling algorithm by using this methodology is rather difficult .",
    "perhaps the most important property of the lvy - ciesielski series is that it constitutes a link between the continuous and the discrete path integral techniques @xcite .",
    "thus , almost all algorithms developed for the discrete case have an analogue in the lvy - ciesielski language .",
    "li and miller @xcite have recently demonstrated how a lie - trotter product for path integrals in many dimensions must be modified so that the number of time slices associated to each degree of freedom be proportional to the quantum effects . in the appendix",
    ", we adapt the technique to the lvy - ciesielski form and show how the number of time slices for each dimension should be chosen as a function of the particle masses .    in section iv",
    ", we utilize the fourth - order direct short - time approximation recently developed in ref .  , to exemplify the use of the lvy - ciesielski series for the implementation of lie - trotter products .",
    "we then perform monte carlo simulations for the @xmath7 lennard - jones cluster using both the all - variable update strategy and the fast sampling algorithm .",
    "the simulation is conducted at @xmath8 , using a number of @xmath9 path variables per degree of freedom .",
    "the numerical results demonstrate that the standard deviations for the average energy and the heat capacity estimators are more than two times larger in the case when all particles are updated simultaneously .",
    "this translates in a computational saving of about @xmath10 if the fast sampling algorithm is utilized .",
    "however , bigger computational savings are expected for larger numbers of path variables .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that the maximal displacements in the metropolis _ et al _ sampling algorithm decrease as fast as @xmath11 with the number @xmath5 of particles that are simultaneously updated .",
    "we argue that this decrease is entropic in nature and has little to do with the interaction between particles .",
    "the generally accepted explanation for the decrease in the maximal displacements is that , by moving several of them at a time , we increase the chances that the particles collide .",
    "this explanation is mistaken and , to the contrary , we find that the decrease in the acceptance probability exists even for non - interacting particles . by means of a numerical example",
    "we show that the entropic explanation also holds for particles that interact through potentials having a strong repulsive part .",
    "having quantified the decrease in statistical efficiency associated with multi - particle moves , we demonstrate that updating the particles one at a time ( whether in a deterministic or random fashion ) is the better strategy in terms of statistical efficiency . by statistical efficiency",
    "we understand the average distance covered by the random walker in the configuration space for a given computational time and average acceptance probability .    to begin with , let us assume that we are given a finite collection @xmath12 of independent identically distributed random vectors ( i.i.d.r.vs ) , taking values in some space @xmath13 .",
    "these random vectors may represent , for instance , the space coordinates of a classical physical system made up of @xmath5 identical particles that do not interact .",
    "let @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , be the normalized distribution of any of the random vectors @xmath16 .",
    "the distribution @xmath14 is assumed to be a smooth function , that is , to have continuous first order partial derivatives .",
    "again , by referring to our physical system , if @xmath17 is the ( common ) potential in which the particles move , then we may set @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the inverse temperature and @xmath20 is the configuration integral of the corresponding canonical system . by independence ,",
    "the overall distribution of the random vectors is given by the product @xmath21 , which is a smooth distribution density on the space @xmath22 .",
    "it is perhaps clear that the best strategy for monte carlo sampling of the product distribution @xmath21 is to perform the sampling individually , for each random vector .",
    "thus , following metropolis _",
    "et al _ @xcite , we propose a new position for the random vector @xmath16 from the trial distribution @xmath23 , which is uniform in a @xmath24-dimensional hypercube centered about @xmath25 and has maximal displacements @xmath26 , for @xmath27 ( therefore the sides of the hypercube have lengths @xmath28 ) .",
    "the move is then accepted with probability @xmath29 and rejected with the remaining probability . repeating the procedure ,",
    "one generates an ergodic markov chain of stationary distribution @xmath30 .",
    "undesirable high correlation between successive positions in the markov chain is the result of two factors i ) high correlation in the proposal distribution , correlation that increases as the maximal displacements decrease , and ii ) low acceptance probability . as a rule of thumb , in order to minimize the correlation , one tunes the average acceptance probability @xmath31 to a value of about @xmath32 , by increasing or decreasing the maximal displacements , as appropriate @xcite .",
    "assume now that we sample the random vectors together and update all variables at once , using the trial distribution @xmath33 .",
    "the move to @xmath34 is accepted with probability @xmath35 and rejected with the remaining probability .",

    "more exactly , if @xmath41 is the shannon entropy corresponding to new maximal displacements @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the desired constant acceptance probability , then @xmath44    we now show that , for sufficiently large @xmath5 , the decrease in the maximal displacements is controlled by the fisher entropy of the smooth distribution @xmath14 . for a random variable ( one - dimensional random vector ) , the estimate can be obtained as follows .",
