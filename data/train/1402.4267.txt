    "in the last two decades abundant evidence about waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere has been gathered .",
    "events of various nature ( standing and propagating waves ) and in various environments ( chromosphere , prominences , active regions , coronal holes ) have been detected .",
    "here we present some examples , while emphasizing that the following list is not exhaustive . in the chromosphere , propagating and standing transverse waves have been detected in spicules @xcite , in mottles @xcite , and in active region fibrils @xcite .",
    "regarding solar prominences , @xcite used high - resolution h@xmath2 filtergrams and observed traveling transverse waves in thin filament threads .",
    "@xcite found transverse oscillations of flowing active region filament threads observed with _",
    "hinode _ sot .",
    "oscillatory events of different nature have been observed in coronal loops : transverse oscillations of active region loops triggered by a disturbance that propagates from the central flare site @xcite ; high - frequency , compressible waves traveling along an active region coronal loop @xcite ; doppler shift oscillations caused by waves propagating in the upper part of coronal loops @xcite ; ubiquitous waves in the solar corona propagating upwards along magnetic field lines @xcite ; etc .",
    "reviews about waves and oscillations in spicules , prominences , and coronal structures can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "many of these events are examples of magnetic flux tubes being perturbed by an external agent .",
    "the transverse loop oscillations described by @xcite and @xcite are a remarkable case because time series of euv images allow to see the lateral swaying of a coronal loop .",
    "this particular phenomenon has been interpreted as a standing fast kink mode oscillation .",
    "fast kink ( i.e. transverse ) waves propagating along magnetic flux tubes are more frequent in the literature than their standing oscillation counterparts .",
    "they have been observed not only in coronal loops ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also in spicules @xcite , in mottles @xcite , in active region fibrils @xcite , and in filament threads @xcite . what is common to all these phenomena is that an external excitation causes the transverse displacement of a magnetic tube and that this perturbation propagates along the tube , where it is usually detected as a time variation of the doppler velocity or the magnetic tube position .",
    "these propagating waves can be excited , e.g. , by a periodic driver acting at a fixed position of the magnetic tube .",
    "this has been the mechanism invoked by @xcite and @xcite to explain the waves propagating along the coronal magnetic field observed by @xcite and @xcite . a fast kink wave propagating along a uniform",
    ", cylindrical magnetic tube produces a periodic transverse motion of the tube such as that in figure  [ fig_cylinder_kink](a ) .",
    "( a)(b )    propagating transverse waves can also be generated by an impulsive , concentrated transverse displacement of the magnetic tube ( see figure  [ fig_cylinder_kink](b ) ) .",
    "such a perturbation of the magnetic tube is a superposition of fast kink eigenmodes , each with its own amplitude . in the absence of dispersion",
    ", the initial wave form would keep its original shape during its propagation , that is , the bulge of figure  [ fig_cylinder_kink](b ) would simply propagate unaltered along the cylinder . fast",
    "kink eigenmodes of a magnetic tube are dispersive , however , and so as time evolves the initial hump transforms into an oscillatory train containing several maxima and minima . in other words ,",
    "away from the excitation point the magnetic tube can suffer not one , but several lateral oscillations about its equilibrium position as the wave train passes by .",
    "hence , transverse oscillations of magnetic tubes do not necessarily require the presence of a continuous driver .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the dispersion of linear fast kink wave trains propagating along uniform , cylindrical magnetic flux tubes .",
    "these wave trains are excited by an impulsive , localized initial disturbance ( figure  [ fig_cylinder_kink](b ) ) . to solve this initial value problem we use a technique based on the method of fourier integrals ( cf .",
    "* section  11.2 ) , that consists of expressing the initial perturbation as a sum of eigenmodes .",
    "this means that the properties of the magnetic tube eigenmodes need to be well known in advance , and for this reason their main features are summarized in sections  [ sect_normal_modes ] and [ sect_cont_modes ] .",
    "next the method of fourier integrals is applied to the cylindrical magnetic tube , and an analytical expression describing the spatial and temporal variation of perturbed variables is obtained ( section  [ sect_fourier ] ) .",
    "this formula is expressed in terms of an integral that contains contributions from all eigenmodes , with amplitudes that depend exclusively on the initial conditions .",
    "accurate approximations to this integral are computed numerically .",
    "the propagation of a concentrated transverse disturbance is considered in section  [ subsect_numerics ] , paying special attention to the dispersion of the wave train during its propagation .",
    "an application to coronal loop transverse oscillations is carried out in section  [ sect_loop_application ] and a discussion of the results and our conclusions are presented in section  [ sect_conclusions ] .",
    "in our analysis we use the linear ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in the cold plasma approximation ,    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the equilibrium density and magnetic field , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the density and magnetic field perturbations , @xmath10 is the plasma displacement , and @xmath11 is the magnetic permeability of free space . in",
    "what follows we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath12 . in these",
    "coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the equilibrium magnetic field is uniform and directed along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "the equilibrium consists of a magnetic tube of radius @xmath16 and plasma density @xmath17 in a magnetic environment with density @xmath18 , both quantities being constants .",
    "the corresponding alfvn speeds are determined by    @xmath19    here we consider an overdense magnetic tube , that is , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    to restrict our analysis to kink waves we assume that perturbations of all quantities are proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "then the system of equations  ( [ eq_mass])([eq_induc ] ) reduces to    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26 ,   \\quad \\rho = \\frac p{v_a^2 } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the magnetic pressure and @xmath28 stands for the alfvn speed at any position .",
    "these equations have to be supplemented with the conditions that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are continuous at the tube boundary ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the system of equations  ( [ eq_xi_r])([eq_press ] ) is fourth order in time .",
    "hence , to set up an initial value problem we need to impose four initial conditions ,    @xmath32",
    "we next take perturbations of all variables in the form    @xmath33,\\ ] ]    and similarly for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath30 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath37-dependence of perturbed variables is omitted in what follows . after substituting these expressions in equations  ( [ eq_xi_r])([eq_press ] ) and in the boundary conditions , which are the conditions of continuity of @xmath29 and @xmath30 at @xmath31",
    ", we obtain an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the eigenvalues are the zeros of the dispersion equation , that defines @xmath38 for a given longitudinal wavenumber , @xmath39 .",
    "this equation has been derived by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and can be expressed as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the bessel function of the first kind and first order , @xmath42 is the modified bessel function of the second kind ( mcdonald function ) , and a prime indicates a derivative .",
    "the radial wavenumbers , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are given by    @xmath45    where we take @xmath46 when @xmath47 , and @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure that leads to equation  ( [ dr_mod ] ) can be found in @xcite , who also discuss the general properties of the dispersion equation .",
    "a short summary now follows .",
    "we consider proper eigenmodes that decay exponentially with the distance from the tube .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of these eigenmodes are the zeros of the function @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath38 is an eigenfrequency of linear ideal mhd equations describing perturbations about a static equilibrium , then @xmath51 is real ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , consequently , @xmath38 is either real or purely imaginary .",
    "purely imaginary frequencies correspond to unstable solutions and since a magnetic tube with straight field lines is stable , all eigenfrequencies must be real .",
    "the condition that the eigenmodes must decay exponentially with the distance from the tube implies that @xmath49 , so @xmath52 ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "since @xmath50 depends on @xmath51 only , it follows that if @xmath38 is an eigenfrequency then @xmath53 is also an eigenvalue .",
    "the two eigenfrequencies with opposite signs correspond to two waves propagating in opposite directions . given that the sign of @xmath38 is irrelevant",
    "we have only considered @xmath54 in this work .",
    "the sign of @xmath39 can also be ignored because the longitudinal wavenumber only appears as @xmath55 in the dispersion equation . in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to solutions with @xmath56 , although both positive and negative @xmath39 are required to obtain the solution of the initial value problem ( cf . section  [ sect_fourier ] ) . for any fixed @xmath39",
    "there is a finite number of eigenvalues ( see figure  [ fig_dr_over](a ) ) . for @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq_kcn ] ) below ) there is only one eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenmode fundamental in the radial direction .",
    "this eigenmode does not have nodes in the radial direction .",
    "when @xmath58 , its frequency tends to  @xmath59 ( see figure  [ fig_dr_over](b ) ) , where the kink speed @xmath60 is defined by    @xmath61    here we follow @xcite and refer to this mode as the global kink mode to distinguish it from other fast kink modes . according to @xcite , in the long wavelength approximation the global kink mode",
    "has an alfvnic character .",
    "when @xmath62 , there are two eigenmodes , one fundamental and one first overtone in the radial direction .",
    "the first overtone has exactly one node in the radial direction , and this node is inside the tube . when @xmath63 , there are three eigenmodes , one fundamental , one first overtone , and one second overtone in the radial direction .",
    "the second overtone has exactly two nodes in the radial direction , and these nodes are inside the tube . and so on , with the number of eigenmodes tending to infinity when @xmath64 . when @xmath65 , the frequency of the @xmath66th overtone is defined by the condition @xmath67 , which gives for its frequency @xmath68 .",
    "then it is straightforward to obtain the expression for @xmath69 ,    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the @xmath66th zero ( in increasing order ) of @xmath72 .    when solving the dispersion equation it is convenient to use the dimensionless variables @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the internal alfvn travel time .",
    "then , one only needs to fix the density ratio @xmath76 ( or the alfvn speed ratio @xmath77 ) to compute @xmath74 for a given @xmath73 from equation  ( [ dr_mod ] ) .",
    "some features of the global kink mode and its first radial overtones are displayed in the dispersion diagram of figure  [ fig_dr_over](a ) , computed for the density ratio @xmath78 .",
    "such as described above , for @xmath79 there is only the global kink mode , that exists for all wavenumbers . in the range @xmath80",
    "the global kink mode and its first radial overtone are the only eigenmodes , etc .",
    "+   +     +      the phase speed and group velocity of a particular eigenmode are defined as    @xmath81    the phase speed gives the propagation velocity of the eigenmode with wavenumber @xmath39 along the magnetic tube .",
    "the group velocity is relevant when one considers the propagation of a wave packet , as we do in this work .",
    "if the medium is dispersive , i.e.  if @xmath82 , then the initial shape of the wave packet will become distorted in time as it propagates .",
    "the dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath39 then determines the shape of the packet .",
    "we first turn our attention to the global kink mode . in the long wavelength approximation",
    "the dispersion relation for the global kink mode propagating in the positive @xmath15-direction is @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 in this limit .",
    "it is also straightforward to derive the approximate dispersion relation valid for small wavelengths ( @xmath86 ) from equation  ( [ dr_mod ] ) ,    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the smallest root of @xmath89 .",
    "this relation is derived for the fundamental mode in the radial direction . from the approximate dispersion relation  ( [ dr_gg_ak ] ) we obtain approximate expressions for the phase speed and group velocity valid for @xmath86 ,    @xmath90    it follows from these expressions that both @xmath91 and @xmath83 tend to @xmath92 as @xmath93 .",
    "we thus see that the phase speed ( group speed ) is a monotonically decreasing ( monotonically increasing ) function of @xmath73 for @xmath86 .",
    "after numerically solving the dispersion equation one can compute the phase speed and the group velocity .",
    "the results of these calculations are presented in figures  [ fig_dr_over](b ) and ( c ) for the density ratio @xmath78 .",
    "it follows from these results and the asymptotic analysis for @xmath86 that the global kink mode phase speed , @xmath91 , is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of the group velocity , @xmath83 , on @xmath39 is non - monotonic .",
    "when @xmath39 varies from 0 to @xmath94 , @xmath83 first monotonically decreases , takes its minimum value , which is smaller than @xmath92 , at an intermediate value of @xmath95 , and then starts to grow monotonically tending to @xmath92 as @xmath93 .",
    "it is important to mention that this minimum of @xmath83 is rather shallow .    regarding the kink mode radial overtones ,",
    "we have already mentioned that the @xmath66th overtone only exists for @xmath96 . for this particular wavenumber ,",
    "the phase and group velocities are equal to @xmath97 and @xmath92 , respectively ( figures  [ fig_dr_over](b ) , ( c ) ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath91 presents a monotonically decreasing behavior whereas @xmath83 shows a non - monotonic dependence with @xmath39 , with a minimum at an intermediate wavenumber .",
    "we next apply the information about the group velocity to explore the behavior of a localized wave packet .",
    "such a feature , initially concentrated in space , is the sum of eigenmodes distributed over a wavenumber range .",
    "we can consider a wave packet with a wide range of wavenumbers as a composition of many wave subpackets with wavenumbers confined to small intervals , so the group velocity is approximately constant for any subpacket .",
    "then the subpackets with higher @xmath83 travel at the wave train front , while those with smaller @xmath83 remain at its back . according to figure  [ fig_dr_over](c ) ,",
    "a concentrated perturbation made of a sum of global kink modes will disperse as it travels along a magnetic tube , with long ( short ) wavelengths occupying its leading ( trailing ) edge .",
    "therefore , the various wavelengths that make an initial perturbation also arrive at different times at a given point along the tube .",
    "if this point is a distance @xmath98 from the source , then long wavelengths ( i.e.  low frequencies ) are the first to arrive , after @xmath99 . then progressively shorter waves with @xmath100 as well as waves with @xmath101 arrive . the wavelengths with @xmath102",
    "will be the last reaching the detection point at a time slightly larger than @xmath103 . regarding the @xmath66th overtone ( dashed and dash - dotted lines of figure  [ fig_dr_over](c ) ) , the maximum propagation speed is attained either for wavenumbers close to @xmath69 or for very large wavenumbers , with intermediate values of @xmath39 having smaller propagation speeds .",
    "this information determines the dispersion properties of a wave packet made exclusively of a kink mode overtone .",
    "+   +    we next explore the influence of the equilibrium density ratio , @xmath76 , on the fast kink modes group velocity .",
    "the density ratio has very little influence on the shape of the global kink mode group velocity ( solid line of figure  [ fig_cg_vae ] ) and this implies that the description of a wave packet dispersion given above does not change when @xmath76 is varied .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath60 becomes smaller when the density ratio is reduced and so the range of variation of @xmath83 is also reduced .",
    "this in turn implies that a wave train dispersion becomes less important for smaller values of @xmath76 . as for the radial overtones ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq_kcn ] ) shows that a decrease ( increase ) of the density ratio leads to larger ( smaller ) values of the cut - off frequencies , such as can be appreciated in figure  [ fig_cg_vae ] .",
    "this directly affects the longer wavelengths that can have a wave train made of a single overtone .",
    "the maximum and minimum values of @xmath83 for a given kink overtone are also influenced by the density ratio , but the overall dependence of the group velocity on @xmath39 remains qualitatively the same .",
    "the spatial and temporal behavior of eigenmodes is described by equation  ( [ rzt_dependence ] ) for @xmath104 and similar ones for all other perturbed variables .",
    "the radial and azimuthal plasma displacements can be written in the form    @xmath105    @xmath106    expressions for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 can be obtained using equations  ( [ eq_induc_1 ] ) and ( [ eq_press ] ) .",
    "note that equations  ( [ xir_of_r ] ) and ( [ xiphi_of_r ] ) are independent of the sign of @xmath38 , so they are the same for the eigenmode propagating in the positive @xmath15-direction and the eigenmode propagating in the negative @xmath15-direction .",
    "it follows from equations  ( [ xir_of_r ] ) and ( [ dr_mod ] ) that the plasma displacement in the radial direction is continuous at @xmath31 and , with the aid of equations  ( [ eq_press ] ) , ( [ xir_of_r ] ) , and ( [ xiphi_of_r ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the magnetic pressure perturbation , @xmath30 , is also continuous at the tube boundary .",
    "the eigenmodes corresponding to the zeros of @xmath50 are called _",
    "proper_. the corresponding eigenfrequencies constitute the point spectrum of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "the distinctive property of the proper eigenmodes is that they are square integrable with respect to @xmath111 on the interval @xmath112 .",
    "in addition to the point spectrum there is a continuous spectrum that consists of the union of two intervals , @xmath113 $ ] and @xmath114 .",
    "eigenfunctions corresponding to frequencies from the continuous spectrum are called _ improper _ because they are not square integrable with respect to @xmath111 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we explained above that there is a finite number of proper eigenmodes for a given longitudinal wavenumber , @xmath39 , and that their frequencies lie in the range @xmath115 . on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath39 improper modes can have any frequency @xmath116 .",
    "now we obtain expressions similar to equations  ( [ xir_of_r ] ) and ( [ xiphi_of_r ] ) for improper eigenmodes .",
    "taking @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath30 in equations  ( [ eq_xi_r ] ) , ( [ eq_xi_phi ] ) , and ( [ eq_press ] ) in the form given by equation  ( [ rzt_dependence ] ) , and eliminating @xmath117 and @xmath118 from the obtained expressions , we obtain the following equation for @xmath109 ,    @xmath119    where @xmath120 for @xmath121 , and @xmath122 for @xmath123 . here the external radial wavenumber , @xmath124 , is given by    @xmath125    where we take @xmath126 .",
    "in addition we obtain expressions for @xmath127 and @xmath128 in terms of @xmath129 ,    @xmath130    the solution to equation  ( [ equ_for_hatp ] ) inside the tube regular at @xmath131 is @xmath132 ( up to a multiplicative constant ) . the reason for introducing the multiplier @xmath133",

    "if we had not introduced the multiplier @xmath148 in the expression for @xmath109 inside the tube , these perturbed variables would have singularities at @xmath149 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that both the plasma displacement in the radial direction and the magnetic pressure perturbation are continuous at @xmath31 for an improper eigenmode .",
    "now we assume that the magnetic flux tube suffers a localized , small amplitude disturbance at a given time ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "we only consider plane polarized kink waves that cause a lateral displacement of the tube such as that of figure  [ fig_cylinder_kink](b ) .",
    "we do not require the perturbation to be periodic along the tube , as is the case when a normal mode is excited .",
    "we introduce cartesian coordinates ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath15 ) with the @xmath15-axis along the tube axis and the @xmath151-axis in the direction of the wave polarization .",
    "we impose the initial conditions @xmath153    where    @xmath154    thus at the initial time the @xmath155 cross - section of the tube is displaced a distance @xmath156 from its equilibrium position .",
    "tube cross - sections with increasing @xmath157 suffer smaller initial displacements .",
    "this is accounted for by the gaussian factor .",
    "hence , these initial conditions correspond to a transverse hump of the tube localized about @xmath155 . the shape of the magnetic cylinder of figure  [ fig_cylinder_kink](b ) has been obtained with these initial conditions and @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",
    "the length of the initial hump is of the order of @xmath160 .",
    "we next derive expressions for @xmath29 and @xmath34 at @xmath150 . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the angle @xmath37 is counted from the @xmath151-axis .",
    "in section  [ sect_govern ] we assumed that the perturbed variables have an azimuthal dependence proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "then , the real expressions for the @xmath111- and @xmath37-components of the displacement are @xmath161 and @xmath162 , where @xmath163 indicates the real part of a quantity .",
    "now , we have the relations    @xmath164    taking into account that @xmath165 is independent of @xmath37 and @xmath166 , we immediately obtain from these relations that    @xmath167    it follows from equations  ( [ init_cond ] ) , ( [ init_xi_x ] ) , and ( [ cylin_car ] ) that    @xmath168    as mentioned in section  [ sect_govern ] , the initial conditions must be completed by supplying the time derivative of @xmath29 and @xmath34 at @xmath150 , that is , the functions @xmath169 and @xmath170 in equation  ( [ init_cond ] ) .",
    "we assume that the magnetic tube is initially at rest , and so the time derivative of @xmath165 and @xmath171 are initially zero .",
    "therefore , the same applies to @xmath29 and @xmath34 , which means that    @xmath172      our aim now is to solve equations  ( [ eq_xi_r])([init_cond ] ) .",
    "since the initial conditions  ( [ init_cond ] ) are imposed on @xmath29 and @xmath34 and their time derivatives , the temporal dependence of the perturbed variables is obtained using the radial and azimuthal displacements only .",
    "for this reason it is convenient to use the variable @xmath173 in what follows .",
    "the complete derivation of the solution for @xmath174 is presented in appendix  [ app - fourier ] and only the main expressions are shown here .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the wave packet propagating in the positive @xmath15-direction , that comes from the terms with amplitude @xmath234 ( with @xmath235 for the global kink mode and @xmath236 for its overtones ) in equation  ( [ expand_eigen - main ] ) .",

    "figure  [ fig_amplr](a ) presents the product @xmath237 for the density ratio @xmath78 and @xmath239 ; these parameter values are those of figure  [ fig_t=0](a ) .",
    "the global kink mode contribution is much larger than that of its overtones and is concentrated in a restricted range of wavenumbers , namely @xmath240 .",
    "the first overtone , that only exists for wavenumbers larger than its cut - off , has a much smaller contribution that also decreases with increasing @xmath39 . and , finally , the second overtone has an even smaller contribution and so its importance in the wave train propagating along the magnetic tube must be very weak . next we consider the same density ratio , @xmath78 , and a longer initial perturbation with @xmath241 ( figure  [ fig_amplr](b ) ) ; these parameter values are those of figure  [ fig_t=0](b ) .",
    "now only the global kink mode has a significant amplitude , the first overtone having a maximum value @xmath242 .",
    "the global kink mode amplitude is now concentrated in a narrower range of @xmath39 because a longer initial disturbance ( @xmath232 ) has a more concentrated fourier transform ( @xmath243 ) ; cf .",
    "equations  ( [ f_xi_x0 ] ) and ( [ hat_f_xi_x0 ] ) .",
    "finally , increasing the density ratio while keeping the shape of the initial perturbation unchanged has very little effect in the global mode contribution : compare the solid lines of figures  [ fig_amplr](a ) and ( c ) . nevertheless , an increase of @xmath76 lowers the cut - off wavenumbers of the radial overtones and so the first overtone is present for smaller @xmath39 , although its amplitude is roughly the same : compare the dashed lines of figures  [ fig_amplr](a ) and ( c ) . on the other hand ,",
    "decreasing the density ratio with respect to the value of figure  [ fig_amplr](a ) has the opposite effect and the first overtone becomes even less important .",
    "hence , we conclude that the shape of the wave packet is mainly defined by the global kink mode .      in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t ]",
    "we consider the initial solution of figure  [ fig_t=0](a ) and show how the initial disturbance splits into two symmetric wave packets travelling at the same speed in opposite directions along the magnetic tube ( figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](a ) ) . after a very short time ( figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](b ) ) both packets become distorted because of dispersion and display a strong oscillation behind them .",
    "this effect becomes more pronounced as time passes ( figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](c ) ) and more oscillations at the front and back of the wave packet develop .",
    "note that figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t ] corresponds to particular values of the density ratio and length of the initial perturbation .",
    "the results are similar for other values of @xmath76 , but changing @xmath244 has strong influence on the evolution of the wave train shape , as we will show later .",
    "+   +     +    figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t ] illustrates the effect of wave dispersion on the wave train at later time ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "a comparison of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](a ) with figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t](c ) shows that the wave train has become very structured because of wave dispersion and that a considerable length of the magnetic tube has become affected by the initial disturbance : while the initial wave pulse has length @xmath246 , at @xmath245 the magnetic tube section in the range @xmath247 displays transverse displacements , and so the wave train is about 6 times longer .",
    "obviously , as the wave train disperses , its amplitude decreases and the amplitude of the radial motion in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](a ) is much smaller than that of the initial perturbation .",
    "figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](a ) displays several distinct features : first , the maximum wave packet amplitude is attained at its central part , where long wavelengths are dominant .",
    "second , the trailing part of the packet is made of a smaller amplitude subpacket with shorter wavelengths . and third , the leading part of the wave train displays small amplitude , small wavelength oscillations .",
    "the origin of these features is clear if the contributions of different modes are separated .",
    "figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](b ) shows the part of the signal that comes from proper modes .",
    "this signal is almost identical to that of panel ( a ) , except for the leading oscillations , that therefore come from improper modes .",
    "we go one step further and plot separately the contributions of the global kink mode ( figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](c ) ) and its first overtone ( figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](d ) ) .",
    "now it is evident that the main part of the wave train is caused by the first of these two modes and that the trailing subpacket arises because of the first overtone .",
    "let us first concentrate on the first of these two subpackets .",
    "its properties can be fully comprehended with the help of figures  [ fig_dr_over](c ) and [ fig_amplr](a ) .",
    "the solid line of figure  [ fig_dr_over](c ) tells us that the global kink mode has a group speed that monotonically decreases from @xmath248 for @xmath249 to @xmath92 as @xmath250 , with a very shallow minimum at an intermediate wavenumber .",
    "hence , in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](c ) ( see the two rightmost vertical lines ) the leading part of the subpacket travels at a velocity @xmath251 and contains long wavelengths , whereas its trailing part travels at a speed @xmath252 and is composed of shorter wavelengths . while figure  [ fig_dr_over](c ) explains the propagation speed of different wavenumbers , the solid line of figure",
    "[ fig_amplr](a ) explains their amplitude : wavenumbers around @xmath253 , travelling at the middle of the wave train , attain the maximum amplitude , while those with smaller and higher @xmath39 have smaller contribution and so the transverse displacement becomes smaller as one moves from the wave train center to its sides .",
    "we now turn our attention to the first overtone subpacket ( figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](d ) ) , that displays its own distinctive features : its amplitude is some 10 times smaller than that of the global mode subpacket , it does not contain long wavelengths , and its main contribution travels at a speed around @xmath254 .",
    "all these properties are well explained by figures  [ fig_dr_over](c ) and [ fig_amplr](a ) .",
    "first , the first overtone has a wavenumber cut - off and it only exists for wavenumbers @xmath255 , so that its contribution to the radial displacement can not contain long wavelengths .",
    "second , the different amplitude of the subpackets in figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](c ) and ( d ) is a consequence of the amplitude of these two modes , that from figure  [ fig_amplr](a ) differ by an order of magnitude more or less . and third",
    ", figure  [ fig_dr_over](c ) indicates that the first overtone has a maximum group velocity @xmath256 and a minimum group velocity @xmath257 for @xmath258 , and these two speeds very precisely limit the propagation speed of the first overtone subpacket ( see the two leftmost vertical lines in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](d ) ) .",
    "+   +     +   +    we now show that the length of the initial pulse strongly determines its dispersion .",
    "figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_short_t ] and [ fig_vae2_delta1_t ] have been obtained with @xmath239 . increasing this parameter leads to a longer initial disturbance",
    "for which the fourier transform of the initial conditions ( functions @xmath259 and @xmath260 in equation  ( [ hat_f_xi_x0 ] ) ) becomes more concentrated around small wavenumbers .",
    "this implies that , for the particular density ratio @xmath78 used so far , an increase in @xmath244 can lead to the first overtone not being excited by the initial perturbation .",
    "this has been shown to be the case for @xmath241 ( see figure  [ fig_amplr](b ) ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_vae2_delta_t](a ) presents the wave train for @xmath245 and for an initial perturbation with @xmath241 .",
    "thus , except for the value of @xmath244 , all parameters are those of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t ] .",
    "the wave packet for @xmath241 shows no signs of the trailing oscillations ( caused by the slower propagation of the first overtone ) and the leading oscillations ( ascribed to improper modes ) that were present in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](a ) .",
    "in fact , by plotting separately these two contributions we have verified that they are negligible , so that the wave train at @xmath245 only contains discernible contributions from the global kink mode .",
    "there are some similarities between the global kink mode contribution for @xmath239 and the wave train for @xmath241 ( figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](c ) and [ fig_vae2_delta_t](a ) ) , namely the presence of long wavelengths at the front of the wave train and shorter wavelengths at its back , and the propagation of the wave train front at a speed @xmath60 .",
    "but there are some important differences too . the wave train in figure",
    "[ fig_vae2_delta_t](a ) lacks the short wavelengths of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](c ) , the reason being that short wavelengths have not been excited because their amplitude is negligible ( see figure  [ fig_amplr](b ) ) . and",
    "since these missing wavelengths are the ones that propagate at a smaller velocity , the wave packet is shorter compared to that of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](c ) and undergoes less dispersion , which in turn implies that it contains less extrema and has a larger amplitude , by a factor @xmath261 . on the other hand , a shorter initial displacement with @xmath159 imparts energy to the global kink mode and its first two overtones , whose signature is present in the wave train of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta_t](b ) . the global kink mode and its first overtone are responsible for the oscillations between the two rightmost and the two leftmost vertical lines , such as previously found in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t ] .",
    "note , however , that the relative amplitude of the first overtone to that of the global kink mode increases when @xmath262 is decreased .",
    "in addition , the second overtone is not excited for @xmath239 , but in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta_t](b ) it causes the transverse magnetic tube displacement that can be seen for @xmath263 .",
    "finally , the relevance of the density ratio on the dispersive spreading of the initial perturbation is analysed .",
    "figure  [ fig_vae_delta1_t](a ) shows the magnetic tube radial displacement for @xmath264 and for the range of positions of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](a ) , so that a comparison of the two figures can be done . the main part of the wave train , i.e. that in the range @xmath265 , corresponds to the global kink mode , that propagates with group speeds between @xmath252 and @xmath266 ( see two rightmost dotted lines of figure  [ fig_vae_delta1_t](a ) ) .",
    "since the kink speed increases with the density ratio , the contribution of the global kink mode affects a slightly wider range of @xmath15 in figure  [ fig_vae_delta1_t](a ) than in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](a ) .",
    "regarding the kink mode overtones , for @xmath264 the first one has @xmath267 and so its contribution lies roughly between the two leftmost vertical lines in figure  [ fig_vae_delta1_t](a ) ; higher overtones have even smaller amplitude and so their contribution is negligible .",
    "thus , depending on the value of @xmath76 the global kink mode and its first overtones can contribute to the wave train with packets separated by some space ( as in figure  [ fig_vae_delta1_t](a ) ) or with packets that have almost no space between them ( as in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](a ) ) .",
    "while in figure  [ fig_vae_delta1_t](a ) the density ratio is larger than the one used in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t ] , in figure  [ fig_vae_delta1_t](b ) it is smaller . now the wave train is almost free from short waves and is more spatially concentrated .",
    "the first issue is caused by the dependence of the wavenumber cut - offs with the density ratio : for @xmath268 we have @xmath269 and this implies that the first overtone receives little energy from the initial lateral displacement .",
    "thus , the wave train of figure  [ fig_vae_delta1_t](b ) is dominated by the global kink mode , whose range of propagation speeds decreases for smaller values of the density ratio and for this reason the wave packet length is smaller than that of figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t](a ) and [ fig_vae_delta1_t](a ) .",
    "assuming that a coronal loop suffers a sudden lateral displacement analogous to that of figure  [ fig_cylinder_kink](b ) , a wave train will then propagate along the tube and will be dispersed as it travels . to apply our results to coronal loops",
    ", we consider a loop radius @xmath270  km and a loop alfvn velocity @xmath271  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "then , the internal travel time is @xmath272  s. regarding the initial disturbance , it has a gaussian shape along the loop ( equation  ( [ f_xi_x0 ] ) ) and we impose an amplitude @xmath273  km and a length given by @xmath239 ( recall that the initial transverse displacement has a length @xmath274 along the loop ) .",
    "the initial disturbance is , therefore , twice longer than that depicted in figure  [ fig_cylinder_kink](b ) . with these parameter values ,",
    "figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t ] gives the shape of the loop boundary after @xmath275  s have elapsed from the initial transverse displacement and covers the range of distances 15  mm  @xmath276  40  mm along the tube from the position of the initial disturbance .",
    "for the adopted value of @xmath156 , the vertical scale in this figure transforms into maximum transverse displacements of the order of @xmath277  km .",
    "this is a very small figure , so one may wonder whether the events studied in this work can be detected with present day instruments .       +   +     +   +    to address this question , we consider the radial velocity , @xmath278 , on the loop surface at a fixed position along the loop .",
    "temporal variations of this quantity can in principle be observed as doppler shift variations if the line - of - sight is contained in the polarization plane of the oscillations or makes a small angle with it . the radial velocity for the density ratio @xmath78 is presented in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](a ) , where the detection point is located 25  mm along the loop from the initial perturbation site .",
    "the temporal variation of @xmath278 is easy to understand from figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t ] : the contribution of the global kink mode arrives first to the detection point ( at @xmath279  s ) and this is followed by the contribution from the first overtone ( starting after @xmath275  s ) .",
    "the global kink mode subpacket contains a range of wavenumbers , with long wavelengths travelling faster than shorter ones , and so the former arrive before the later .",
    "we note that each of these two subpackets only lasts about 10  s , so we conclude that the whole event has very short duration .",
    "the wavelet diagram of @xmath278 is shown in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](b ) .",
    "most of the power in this plot originates from the global kink mode and has periods between 1 and 4  s , with long periods being the first to arrive at the detection point , as described before .",
    "the first overtone also leaves its contribution in the wavelet diagram , in the form of a small power hump around @xmath280  s with period smaller than 1  s. having a detection point at a larger distance ( 50  mm ) from the wave packet source implies that the wave train has more time to disperse because of the different group speeds of its constituent wavelengths ( see figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](c ) ) .",
    "therefore , the wave train takes longer to transit at the detection point and the large power blob in the wavelet diagram is more inclined ( figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](d ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , the wave train contains the same wavenumbers ( and so the same periods ) and this means that the power level at a fixed period does not change when moving the detection point along the loop .    in the numerical results of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z ]",
    "only the global kink mode has significant power . from the results of figures  [ fig_vae2_delta_t](b ) and [ fig_vae_delta1_t](a ) we know that the global kink mode becomes more dispersive if shorter initial disturbances or larger density ratios are considered .",
    "it is worth mentioning again that the signature of higher wave dispersion is a more inclined power blob in the wavelet diagram of the line - of - sight velocity .",
    "moreover , kink mode overtones can be excited by shorter initial disturbances and , to a lesser extent , by larger density ratios . in particular , for the values @xmath159 and @xmath78 the first overtone leaves a clear signature in the wavelet spectrum ( similar to that present in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](b ) at @xmath281  s ) with power half that of the global kink mode .    at this point",
    ", we test the consistency of these results .",
    "figure  [ fig_amplr](a ) points out that , when the global kink mode is excited , then a train of waves with @xmath282 will be generated . using the shortest wavelength in this range and the approximation @xmath283 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig_dr_over](a ) ) , we get the period @xmath284  s ; longer wavelengths result in larger periods .",
    "all this is in good agreement with figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "a second property that can be tested is the amplitude of the @xmath278 oscillations .",
    "such as described above , the maximum radial displacement at @xmath275  s is close to @xmath277  km .",
    "let us assume that this maximum displacement corresponds to the wavenumber with maximum amplitude , namely @xmath285 ; see figure  [ fig_amplr](a ) .",
    "we further assume that the maximum oscillatory displacement and speed follow the relation of a harmonic oscillator , i.e. @xmath286 . using the approximation @xmath287",
    ", we obtain @xmath288  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the velocity amplitudes of figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "the global kink mode is responsible for the most important part of the propagating wave train .",
    "for very long wavelengths , this mode is characterized by transverse motions of the magnetic tube with very small density variations . for the shorter wavelengths that are excited by a localized disturbance ,",
    "however , the global kink mode produces periodic variations of the loop radius and so the transverse motions are accompanied by appreciable density changes .",
    "here we consider , as an example , the density associated to the radial velocity variations of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](a ) .",
    "the ratio of perturbed to unperturbed density is plotted in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_rho_z](a ) together with the radial velocity itself , rescaled to fit in the same vertical scale .",
    "the density changes are quite appreciable and reach 1015% the equilibrium loop density .",
    "in addition , both subpackets of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](a ) are present in figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_rho_z](a ) and from the variations they cause we conclude that the global kink mode produces more important density changes at the loop boundary than its first overtone .",
    "in fact , although the later oscillations can be discerned in the signal of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_rho_z](a ) , their power is so small that they are not visible in the wavelet diagram of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_rho_z](b ) , where the power of global kink mode oscillations is dominant .",
    "one can also see that the velocity and density oscillations are slightly out of phase , with the changes of @xmath278 preceding those of @xmath8 by about 1  s. on the other hand , the two signals have the same distribution of power versus time ( compare the wavelet diagrams of figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](b ) and [ fig_vae2_delta1_rho_z](b ) ) .",
    "we have analyzed the propagation of impulsively excited , linear fast kink wave packets in cylindrical magnetic tubes .",
    "the method we use is based in decomposing the initial perturbation in a sum of eigenmodes .",
    "we have imposed a concentrated transverse disturbance of the magnetic tube and have found that most of its energy is imparted to the global kink mode .",
    "the concentrated transverse impulse is the sum of many different global fast kink modes with their own amplitude and that travel at their own group velocity in the packet .",
    "for this reason , the wave train dispersion is determined by two key ingredients : on one hand , the dependence of the group velocity on the longitudinal wavenumber , that is represented in figures  [ fig_dr_over](c ) and [ fig_cg_vae ] . on the other hand , the amplitude of the global kink mode as a function of the longitudinal wavenumber ( figure  [ fig_amplr ] ) .",
    "we have found that large internal to external density ratios and especially shorter initial perturbations enhance wave dispersion .",
    "the signature of a wave train at a fixed point in a coronal loop has been investigated using the radial velocity and the density perturbation as measurable quantities .",
    "we have shown that both variables display very fast oscillations with periods varying between 1 and 4  s and with detectable amplitudes .",
    "these values have been obtained for a loop radius @xmath270  km and an internal alfvn speed @xmath271  km  s@xmath1 , although these are just illustrative values .",
    "if the loop radius is doubled or its internal alfvn speed is halved , then the obtained periods and time scales are doubled .",
    "that is , both the horizontal and vertical scales in figures  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](b ) , ( d ) and [ fig_vae2_delta1_rho_z](b ) are doubled . in view of the diversity of both @xmath16 and @xmath92 in coronal loops ,",
    "we conclude that the dispersion of a transverse coronal loop perturbation can be detected as periodic variations of the velocity and density with periods ranging from a fraction of a second to tens of seconds .",
    "@xcite performed a numerical simulation of impulsively generated , small - amplitude waves in a slab coronal loop model .",
    "regarding transverse oscillations , these authors concluded that they could be detected as changes in the loop position through difference images of time series taken with a cadence of seconds or better .",
    "moreover , @xcite solved the same problem for a cylindrical loop geometry and obtained that time scales of the fast kink wave are of the order of a dozen of seconds , in agreement with the results presented here .",
    "@xcite did not describe the dispersive properties of localized transverse loop disturbances and , for a perturbation centered in the loop axis , did not obtain large density variations .",
    "this contradicts our conclusions ( see figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_rho_z ] ) , probably because the initial disturbance of @xcite has a very small amplitude , of the order of 0.1  km .",
    "impulsively generated transverse waves in coronal loops modeled as straight or curved slabs @xcite or as curved cylinders @xcite have also been investigated , although the main aim of these studies is the analysis of transverse oscillations in line - tied loops , rather than the propagation of localized disturbances .",
    "a localized axisymmetric compression ( rather than the localized transverse excitation investigated here ) is the sum of fast sausage eigenmodes , which in a uniform cylinder are highly dispersive .",
    "studies of propagating fast sausage wave trains have been performed for example by @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that an impulsive axisymmetric excitation of a magnetic cylinder generates a clear time signature when the wave packet arrives at a point along the tube away from the initial disturbance .",
    "this time signature consists of a periodic phase , followed by a quasi - periodic phase , and a decaying phase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this complex temporal behavior is produced by the dispersive character of the fast sausage mode , that results in different frequencies arriving at different times at the detection position . in the study of @xcite ,",
    "the detected density perturbation contains a continuous variation of the period and its wavelet diagram shows large power distributed between 3 and 10  s , with a total duration of the oscillatory event of about 20  s. in fact , the wavelet spectra of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_z](d ) and figures  3 to 5 of @xcite are remarkably similar in spite of the different nature of the propagating disturbances .",
    "fast sausage wave trains propagating along coronal loops have been invoked by @xcite as the cause of the compressible waves analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these waves have also been put forward as the cause of the `` wavelet tadpoles '' found in solar decimetric radio bursts @xcite .",
    "but in view of the similar density perturbations produced by a transverse excitation and an axisymmetric compression , these conclusions may need additional work to be confirmed or refuted .    our method for solving equations  ( [ eq_mass])([eq_induc ] ) in a magnetic cylinder has no underlying assumptions , except that the magnetic tube and the environment are uniform and that the internal to external density ratio is larger than one .",
    "it has several advantages over the direct numerical solution of equations  ( [ eq_mass])([eq_induc ] ) : the numerical integration of this set of partial differential equations requires using a two - dimensional mesh of points in the @xmath111- and @xmath15-directions . moreover , to obtain the solution at a given time , @xmath219 , the temporal evolution of the five perturbed variables @xmath29 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath30 must be computed from @xmath150 to @xmath219 . to make things worse , to produce the results of figure  [ fig_vae2_delta1_t ] , for example",
    ", one needs to consider , at least , the large range of distances @xmath289 , with @xmath16 the magnetic tube radius .",
    "the method we use is a numerical one and so it also suffers from numerical inaccuracy .",
    "it is nevertheless optimised to study wave propagation along a uniform magnetic tube .",
    "imposing the initial conditions allows to obtain the amplitudes of the eigenmodes ( @xmath194 from equation  ( [ a_pm - main ] ) and @xmath197 from equation  ( [ a_pm_om - main ] ) ) .",
    "once these amplitudes are known , any perturbed variable can be computed at any position and time with equation  ( [ four_trans_inv - main ] ) .",
    "a similar approach was used by @xcite , based on the work of @xcite , to estimate the energy deposited in the normal modes given an external perturbation located in the solar corona .",
    "the method can be extended to study the propagation of , for example , an axisymmetric compression of the magnetic tube .",
    "such a disturbance can be expressed as the sum of fast sausage eigenmodes .",
    "this study will be almost a complete repetition of the analysis in this paper .",
    "the only difference is that , in the case of fast sausage waves , there is a cut - off wavenumber even for the mode fundamental in the radial direction .",
    "this implies that we can expect more substantial contribution from improper eigenmodes .",
    "in this paper we have considered a magnetic tube with a sharp boundary .",
    "if , instead , we consider a tube with the density continuously varying from its value inside the tube to a lower value outside , then there will be wave damping due to resonant absorption . even in this case",
    "the initial value problem can be solved using the same method as the one used in this paper .",
    "the only difference is that , in the case of a tube inhomogeneous in the radial direction , it is usually not possible to calculate the proper and improper eigenfunctions analytically , so they have to be calculated numerically .",
