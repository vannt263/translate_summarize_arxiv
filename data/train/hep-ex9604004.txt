    "silica aerogels(aerogels ) are a colloidal form of glass , in which globules of silica are connected in three dimensional networks with siloxan bonds .",
    "they are solid , very light , transparent and their refractive index can be controlled in the production process .",
    "many high energy and nuclear physics experiments have used aerogels instead of pressurized gas for their erenkov counters @xcite .",
    "several experiments in near future operating under very high dose of radiation are likely to employ aerogel erenkov counters for their particle identification systems@xcite .",
    "stability of aerogels under such circumstances has , however , not been studied yet . in this report",
    "we for the first time show the effect of radiation damage on aerogel samples produced by some of us at kek@xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we quantify the erenkov light production in aerogels .",
    "prospects of using aerogels in present and future experiments are explored in the third section . experimental setup and results",
    "are described in fourth and fifth sections , respectively .",
    "conclusion is stated in the sixth section of this report .",
    "the production method of aerogels used for the kek b - factory experiment can be found in ref .",
    "accessible range of refractive index ( @xmath9 ) in this method is between 1.006 and 1.060 , and it can be controlled to a level of @xmath10=0.0004 . typical size of a tile was 12 cm @xmath11 12 cm @xmath11 2 cm within a tolerance of 0.3% .",
    "absorption and scattering lengths as functions of incident wavelength were obtained from a transmittance measurement with a spectrophotometer@xcite using the following relations .",
    "we defined a transmission length @xmath12 as ; @xmath13 where t / t@xmath14 is transmittance , and @xmath15 is thckness of aerogels .",
    "then we found the absorption and scattering length by fitting @xmath12 with the following equations ; @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is absorption length , @xmath19 is scattering length , and a , b are free parameters .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ transmittance ] . at 400 nm , where a typical photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) with a bialkali photocathode has maximum sensitivity ,",
    "the absorption and scattering lengths were measured to be @xmath20 and @xmath21 cm , respectively .",
    "the erenkov light yield of our aerogel samples was measured using a 3.5 gev / c @xmath22 beam at kek ps ( @xmath23 beam line ) .",
    "light yield from 12cm - thick aerogel ( _ i.e. _ , 6 layers ) was measured by two 3-inch pmts which were directly attached to both sides of aerogel surfaces .",
    "the counter size was 12 cm @xmath11 12 cm @xmath11 12 cm .",
    "surfaces other than the photocathode area were covered by goretex white reflector@xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as defined below , are given in table [ n0 ] .",
    "number of photoelectrons ( @xmath24 ) is given by frank - tamm s equation@xcite  : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fine structure constant , @xmath28 thickness of radiator , @xmath29 charge of an incident particle , @xmath30 erenkov angle , @xmath31 quantum efficiency of the pmts , and @xmath32 detection efficiency including light absorption and light collection .",
    "energy - integrated quantum efficiency of pmts used in this experiment was measured to be @xmath33    using equations [ frank - tamm ] and [ qe ] , @xmath32 was estimated to be @xmath34 0.6 , which is higher than that for any other existing aerogel counters .",
    "the erenkov quality factor @xmath25 defined as ; @xmath35 for samples of different refractive indices are given in table [ n0 ] . for our aerogels ,",
    "@xmath25 was typically @xmath34100@xmath36 , independent of the refractive index in the range of 1.01 @xmath37 1.03 .",
    "@xmath0-factories are high luminosity colliders where copious amount of @xmath0-mesons are produced and their decays are studied @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of these machines is to study the cp violation in the heavy quark sector @xcite . because of high luminosity of these machines",
    ", corresponding detectors are subjected to a substantial amount of radiation from both physics and background events .",
    "particle identification is a vital part of the detectors in these machines .",
    "threshold aerogel erenkov counters are being proposed for @xmath38 separation in these detectors .",
    "two asymmetric @xmath0-factories , producing @xmath0-mesons by annihilating electrons and positrons are being constructed at kek @xcite and slac @xcite .",
    "threshold aerogel erenkov counters are to be used as parts of particle identification system .",
    "radiation dose in these detectors is estimated to be typically 1 krad / year at places closest to the beam - pipe @xcite .",
    "an imaging erenkov counter using aerogel radiator has been proposed @xcite , which could be a potential candidate for a particle identification system at low angle in a generic hadron @xmath0-factories , such as the hera-@xmath0 experiment@xcite . considering the scattering length of our aerogel ( figure [ transmittance ] ) , aerogel as thin as 1 cm",
    "can be used as a radiator to make a ring image of the erenkov radiation . in case of the hera-@xmath0 experiment ,",
    "the radiation dose is expected to be 10mrad / year at the innermost edge .",
    "possibility of separating high energy isotopes by aerogel erenkov counters is discussed here . defining @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 using equations [ frank - tamm ] , [ n0def ] , and [ definition ] .    assuming a poisson distribution for @xmath24 , the measurement error of @xmath42 is calculated to be @xmath43 the momentum resolution for a nucleon is expressed as @xmath44 at a little above the threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath45 , this becomes @xmath46 assuming @xmath47 @xmath36 , @xmath28=10 cm , and @xmath9=1.05 , we obtain a momentum resolution of 0.07/@xmath29 which is better than the typical resolution of magnetic spectrometers for high-@xmath29 incident particles _",
    "i.e. _ , heavy nuclei .",
    "therefore a combination of aerogel counters and a magnetic spectrometer can separate isotopes .",
    "the nuclear charge @xmath29 can be measured by some other devices such as scintillator and/or combination of erenkov radiators .",
    "rigidity @xmath48 can also be measured by the magnetic spectrometer .",
    "therefore we can determine the mass number of the nucleus ( a ) , using the relationship @xmath49 for nuclei having the @xmath50 value close to 2 , measurement error of a is calculated to be @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the rigidity resolution of the spectrometer determined by the position resolution and multiple coulomb scattering",
    ". therefore the limit of separating heavy isotopes is held by spectrometer resolution .",
    "for example , with n = 1.05 aerogel and for 5 gev / nucleon region , we can distinguish nuclei up to boron with a 0.5%-resolution spectrometer and up to vanadium with a 0.1%-resolution one .    in summary , using aerogels",
    ", we can distinguish nuclear fragments in heavy ion collisions at low angle .",
    "combination of aerogel counters of several refractive indices can even replace a magnetic spectrometer as far as the issue of particle identification goes .    for the rhic collider",
    ", the radiation dose at a very low angle is considered to be less than 100krad / year @xcite .",
    "heao - c2 experiment @xcite , which used aerogel erenkov counters , has measured an abundance of heavy nuclei in high energy cosmic rays .",
    "quality of our aerogel is more than four times better than that used in heao - c2 , thereby showing that if used , it could substantially improve the quality of the data . in addition",
    ", a combination of aerogels and a magnetic spectrometer in the experiment could separate the isotopes .",
    "this would be a completely new method .",
    "the expected radiation dose is 10 krad / year at 600 km altitude @xcite .",
    "recently a space station based experiment  anti - matter spectrometer ( ams ) has been proposed@xcite , which will look for heavy anti - matter nuclei in space . the same technique for isotope separation discussed above",
    "can be used to separate isotopes in this spectrometer .",
    "the ams will orbit the earth at about 300 km altitude , where the radiation dose is expected to be several kilorads per year .",
    "optical transparency of the aerogel should be as high as possible not to lose erenkov photons inside it .",
    "the reflactive index of the aerogel ( n ) , should be stable during an experiment . in the present work , two properties of aerogel samples , transmittance and refractive index",
    "were measured in order to monitor radiation damage on the samples at the irradiation facility of national tsing hua university ( taiwan ) . in the cases of @xmath0-factories and space experiments ,",
    "most of the irradiation is caused by electrons and/or @xmath53-rays of critical energies .",
    "we used a co@xmath54 @xmath53-ray source , activity of which was 1320 curie .",
    "the error in estimation of radiation dose was dominated by the uncertainty in the placement of the sample ( 0.3 cm ) in front of the source and the ambiguity of radius dependent dose .",
    "the error at the highest dose value ( 9.8mrad of _ equivalent  dose _",
    "@xcite ) was the largest , and it was 17% .",
    "for each aerogel sample , five or six irradiations were carried out .",
    "transmittance of the aerogel samples was measured by observing the ratio of photons absorbed in the aerogel volume with and without the irradiation .",
    "a schematic diagram of the setup is given in figure  [ setupa ] .",
    "three aerogel samples of dimensions 12 cm @xmath11 12 cm @xmath11 2 cm each were stacked together in a zinc box .",
    "this box was kept inside a mother - box having an led light box on one side and a photo - multiplier tube on the other .",
    "the whole system was enclosed in a big light - tight box .",
    "inner sides of this box were covered with black clothes to absorb any stray light .",
    "we made two such stacks for each refractive index .",
    "one was irradiated ( rad - sample ) and the other one was kept shielded in the irradiation cell ( ref - sample ) .",
    "the latter is for reference .",
    "it is important that both rad and ref be kept under same environmental conditions to cancel out any effects caused by humidity , temperature , dust , or any other factors other than gamma - ray radiation .",
    "the led ( blue in color ) was triggered by an external pulse generator to produce bursts of photon . typically the trigger signal had a pulse height of 3.75 v , width of 420 ns , and was repeated every 10 msec .",
    "about 400 photo - electrons were produced for each burst in the absence of aerogel asmples between the led and the phototube .",
    "the number reduced to about 200 p.e . when the stack of aerogel was introduced .",
    "we integrated the charge produced by a 2-inch pmt @xcite for each photon burst within a gate of 0.5 @xmath55sec .",
    "ratio of this integrated charge with aerogel between pmt and led to that without aerogel gives us a measure of the transparency of that aerogel sample .",
    "we will call this ratio as @xmath56 for irradiated sample and @xmath57 for the reference sample .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 gives us the transparency of irradiated sample with respect to the reference one .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath59 is sensitive only to radiation damage , whereas @xmath57 tells us if there is deterioration such as due to atmospheric conditions . after each stage of irradiation ,",
    "the rad and ref samples were tested for transmittance , and the ratios @xmath57 , @xmath56 and @xmath59 were calculated .    before the irradiation , @xmath57 and @xmath56 were measured several times to make sure that we get a set of systematically consistent consecutive readings .",
    "the dominant systematic error came from the uncertainty of placement of aerogel crystals .",
    "other minor sources were temperature dependence and instabilities of pmt and led . from these readings we found that the combined error of measurement of each transparency ratio , @xmath56 or @xmath57 was 0.55% .",
    "therefore we estimated the error of r@xmath60 to be 0.78(=0.55@xmath61)% .",
    "refractive index of the aerogel sample was monitored using the _ prism formula _",
    "@xmath62 where @xmath9 is the refractive index , @xmath63 the angle of the prism , @xmath27 the angle of the minimum deflection .",
    "the setup for measuring @xmath9 is shown in figure  [ setupb ] . a red laser ( ar ii ) was shone on the corner of the aerogel sample placed on a rotating table .",
    "the aerogel behaved as a prism , and deviated the laser beam on a screen placed at a distance @xmath64 . by rotating the table manually , and checking the minimum distance @xmath65 , angle of the minimum deflection @xmath27",
    "was found out .",
    "a special sample was prepared which was irradiated in parallel with the stacks for transmittance test .",
    "its refractive index was monitored by the method described above after each stage of irradiation .",
    "we estimated the error of refractive index measurement by calculating error propagation of the prism formula .",
    "it is estimated as ; @xmath66 ^ 2 \\left\\",
    "{ { d^2 \\over 4l^4 } ( \\delta l)^2+{1 \\over 4 l^2}(\\delta d)^2 \\right\\ } + { 1\\over 4 }   { \\sin ^2 { \\alpha \\over 2 } \\over \\sin ^4 { \\phi \\over 2 } } ( \\delta \\phi)^2 .",
    "\\label{errorprism}\\ ] ] for @xmath9 = 1 .012 and 1.028 crystals , the accuracy of measuring @xmath64 was @xmath67 = 0.2 cm and that of @xmath65 was @xmath68 = 0.1 cm . for @xmath9",
    "= 1.018 samples , however , the @xmath68 was worse ( = 0.3 cm ) due to the inferior surface quality , giving rise to a spread of the laser spot on the screen .",
    "error in measuring the refracting angle of the sample was @xmath69 = @xmath70 .",
    "the errors @xmath71 were then calculated to be 0.00035 for @xmath9 = 1.012 and 1.028 samples , and 0.001 for @xmath9 = 1.018 sample , using equation  [ errorprism ] . it may be noted that @xmath68 dominates the final error .",
    "samples of three refractive indices  : 1.012 , 1.018 and 1.028 were tested .",
    "the transparency ratio @xmath59 was measured at several points , ranging from 1 krad to 9.8 mrad .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ radtra ] for each reflactive index .    no degradation in transparency",
    "is observed in any samples within experimental errors . defining absolute deterioration as the maximum of the measurement error and the deviation from the initial measurement ,",
    "we conclude that the radiation damage to transparency of the samples is less than 1.3% at 90% confidence level ( cl ) at 9.8 mrad dose .",
    "samples of three refractive indices  : 1.012 , 1.018 and 1.028 were tested .",
    "refractive index was measured at several points , ranging from 1 krad to 9.8 mrad .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ radind ] .",
    "angle @xmath63 for the aerogel samples was @xmath72 .",
    "typical values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 were 160 cm and 6 cm , respectively .",
    "accuracy of determining refractive index ( @xmath71 ) in this method is better than 0.001 .",
    "again , we do not see any change in refractive index in any of the samples within experimental errors @xcite .",
    "the three irradiated samples were later tested with the pion beam at the @xmath73 beam line of the kek - ps .",
    "momentum of the beam was varied between 0.8 gev / c and 3.5 gev / c , from which refractive indices of the samples could be calculted .",
    "the numbers perfectly agreed with the values obtained at the production time ( the open symbols in figure [ radind ] ) .",
    "this gives us additional confirmation that there has not been any radiation damage to the aerogel samples .",
    "using the same definition of deterioration as above , we conclude that the radiation damage to refractive index of the samples is less than 0.001 at 90% cl at 9.8 mrad dose .",
    "silica aerogels of low refractive index ( @xmath74 ) are found to be radiation - hard at least up to 9.8 mrad of gamma - ray radiation .",
    "we observe no change in transparency and refractive index within the error of measurement after the irradiation .",
    "measurement accuracies were 0.8% for transparency and @xmath750.0006 for refractive index , respectively .",
    "90%-cl upper limits on the radiation damage are 1.3% for transparency and 0.001 for refractive index , respectively .",
    "silica aerogels can be used in high - radiation environments , such as @xmath0-factories , nuclear and heavy - ion experiments , space - station and satellite experiments , without any fear of radiation damage .",
