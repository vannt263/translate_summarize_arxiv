    "the bak - sneppen ( bs ) model was proposed as a possible explanation of mass extinctions observed in the fossil record @xcite , and was recently adapted to model experimental data on bacterial populations @xcite .",
    "independent of its biological interpretation , the model has atracted much attention as a prototype of self - organized criticality ( soc ) under extremal dynamics @xcite .",
    "the model has been studied through various approaches , including simulation @xcite , theoretical analysis @xcite , probabilistic analysis ( run time statistics ) @xcite , renormalization group @xcite , field theory @xcite and mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "some variants have been proposed , for example the anisotropic bs model @xcite . in this paper , we study the consequences of extremal dynamics , using mean - field theory and simulation . with this aim , we propose variants of the model and analyse how varying the updating rule affects the stationary probability density and the critical behaviour",
    ".    in the evolutionary interpretation of the bs model , each site @xmath6 represents a  niche \" occupied by a single species , and bears a real - valued variable @xmath1 representing the  fitness \" of this species .",
    "( in the present context",
    " fitness \" denotes a propensity to resist extinction : if @xmath7 then species @xmath8 goes extinct before @xmath6 , so that @xmath1 may be termed a ",
    "barrier to extinction \" . ) at each step the site with the smallest @xmath1 , and its nearest neighbors , are replaced with randomly chosen values .",
    "the replacement of the neighboring variables with new random values may be interpreted as a sudden unpredictable change in fitness when a nearby niche ( which might have borne a predator , or a food source for the species in question ) , is suddenly colonized by a new species .",
    "selection , at each step , of the global minimum of the @xmath9 (  extremal dynamics \" ) represents a highly nonlocal process , and would appear to require an external agent with complete information regarding the state of the system at each moment .",
    "applications of the model in evolution studies are reviewed in @xcite .    in the original updating rule , neighbors are randomly affected by the extinction of an interacting species .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect that evolution should obey this specific rule on a specific lattice .",
    "thus , we ask : what happens if the extinction of the least adapted species favors ( or prevents ) the extinction of other species ?",
    "moreover , what is the signature of extremal dynamics that can , in principle , allow us to recognize it in the real world ?",
    "due to extremal dynamics , the bs model exhibits scale invariance in the stationary state , in which several quantites display power - law behaviour @xcite .",
    "simulations show that the stationary distribution of barriers follows a step function , being zero ( in the infinite - size limit ) for @xmath10 @xcite . relaxing the extremal condition leads to a smooth probability density and loss of scale invariance @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of the bs model is that a simple updating rule leads to a singular stationary probability density @xmath0 .",
    "an intriguing question therefore arises , as to how changes in the updating rule affect this density , an issue that has not , to our knowledge , been investigated previously . in this work",
    "we examine the consequences of rules in which one or more sites are updated according to @xmath11 , instead of being replaced by a random number .",
    "( here @xmath12 maps the interval [ 0,1 ] to itself . )",
    "we find that this can provoke dramatic changes in the stationary probability density .",
    "in the extremal dynamics limit , the variant models belong to the same universality class as the original .",
    "we find that the hallmarks of extremal dynamics are that i ) the stationary probability density is singular , and ii ) with probability one , the extremal @xmath1 ( i.e. , the next variable to be updated ) belongs to the ` prohibited ' region in which @xmath2 . using a two - site mean - field approximation , we also find evidence that nontrivial correlations are restricted to the prohibited region .",
    "the balance of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the models , which are then analyzed using mean - field like approaches in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we present simulation results , and summarize our conclusions in sec . v.",
    "the bak - sneppen @xcite model is a discrete - time markov process on a d - dimensional lattice of @xmath13 sites , with periodic boundaries . at each site",
    "we define a real - valued variable @xmath14 .",
    "initially , these variables are independently assigned random values uniform on [ 0,1 ) . at time 1 , the site @xmath15 bearing the minimum of all the numbers @xmath16 is identified , and it , along with its @xmath17 nearest neighbors , are given new random values , again drawn independently from the interval [ 0,1 ) .",
    "( in the one dimensional case considered here this amounts to : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are independent and uniformly distributed on [ 0,1 ) ; for @xmath24 , @xmath25 . ) at step 2 this process is repeated , with @xmath15 representing the site with the global minimum of the variables @xmath26 , and so on . in the _ random neighbor _ version of the model ,",
    "the process is realized on a complete graph ( all sites are considered neighbors ) ; two randomly selected sites are updated in addition to the minimum @xmath15 .",
    "we now define three modified bak - sneppen models , that differ from the original only in the way that the barriers @xmath1 evolve . in one ,",
    "the site @xmath27 bearing the _ maximum _ of the @xmath9 is replaced with a random number @xmath21 and the two nearest neighbors are replaced with their own _ square roots _ : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we shall refer to this as the ` radical ' variant . in the second variant ,",
    "the site with the maximum value is replaced by its own value _ squared _ , while its two nearest neighbors receive random numbers @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath30 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "this will be called the ` centered square ' version .",
    "finally , we define a ` peripheral square ' variant , in which one of the nearest neighbors of @xmath27 is squared , while @xmath27 and its other neighbor are replaced with random numbers : @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "( here @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a random variable that assumes values of + 1 and -1 with equal probability . )",
    "the motivation for studying these variants is twofold .",
    "first , the bak - sneppen model is notable for exhibiting a singular stationary probability density , and it is of interest to examine the effect of changes in the dynamical rule on this density and on the critical behavior . if we introduce a deterministic function @xmath39 as part of the updating rule , it is desirable that @xmath12 map the interval [ 0,1 ] to itself , making functions of the form @xmath40 a natural choice . in this context",
    "we note that the variants feature what may be called ` migration ' , that is , the systematic movement of certain variables @xmath1 within the interval @xmath41 . in the radical variant",
    "the migration is from the populated region ( smaller @xmath42 ) to the ` excluded ' region ( larger @xmath42 ) , whereas in the square versions migration occurs in the opposite direction .    secondly , the variants admit interpretation as evolutionary processes .",
    "( in the modified models , we have for convenience defined the site with the maximum variable as the most vulnerable , so that small @xmath1 now corresponds to high fitness . ) in the radical variant , replacement of the least - fit species provokes a reduction in the fitness of its neighbors , without leading to their immediate extinction .",
    "thus , some memory of the fitness of the neighboring species is retained .",
    "the radical variant therefore seems a plausible modification of the original model , in the biological context . in the peripheral square variant",
    "the extinction of the least - fit species provokes extinction of one neighbor , and increased fitness of the other .",
    "finally , in the centered - square variant , @xmath43 represents an increase in the fitness of the least viable element of the system , while its neighbors go extinct .",
    "we develop mean - field approximations for the original and modified models , along the lines of refs . @xcite and @xcite . to begin , we relax the extremal condition introducing a flipping rate of @xmath44 at site @xmath6 , where @xmath45 is a characteristic time , irrelevant to stationary properties , and which we set equal to one ( @xmath46 ) . call this regularized system the ` finite - temperature ' model .",

    "further study is needed to determine whether this is represents a qualitative difference between the two formulations , or is instead due to finite size and/or finite numerical resolution .",

    "thus we find strong evidence that all of the variants introduced here belong to the same universality class as the original model .",
    "in order to understand the implications of extremal dynamics , we propose several modified bak - sneppen models .",
    "although different updating rules lead to completely different probability densities , they are always singular at one or more points . the step - like singularities appear in the limiting densities , either as @xmath68 in the finite temperature model ( on an infinite lattice ) , or as the system size @xmath109 , under extremal dynamics .",
    "thus the double limit of infinite size and zero temperature is required for the bs model or it variants to generate a singular probability density .",
    "a remarkable feature common to the original model and all the variants considered , is that in the infinite - size limit , and under extremal dynamics , a certain interval @xmath280 $ ] has probability zero , and yet contains the extremal site with probability one .",

    "correlations between site variables @xmath284 are zero unless one or more of these values falls in @xmath285 .",
    "our conclusions regarding the form of the stationary densities are based on mean - field analyses that are exact for the random - neighbor versions , as is verified numerically .",
    "we also present a pair approximation for the original model .",
    "an important point is that mean - field theory captures the form of the probability density correctly , as shown via simulations of the modified models on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the latter suggest that the critical exponents are independent of dynamics .",
    "the bak - sneppen model appears to be a prototype for a large universality class , since countless variants , beyond those presented here , are possible .",
    "we expect any dynamics that respects the symmetry of the original model ( that is , spatial isotropy ) , and that does not introduce new conserved quantities , to have the same exponents as the original model .",
    "this is interesting , since the same critical behavior may subsist , as it were , upon stationary distributions of very different forms . aside from its intrinsic interest ,",
    "the question of universality is important for applications , since the precise form of the dynamics in a specific setting ( e.g. , evolution ) is generally unknown , and probably quite different from that of the original model . power laws and a singular stationary density only appear in the extremal dynamics limit , which may be difficult to realize in spatially extended natural systems ."
