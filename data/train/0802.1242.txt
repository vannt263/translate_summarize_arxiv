    ", we will focus on the overall spectrum of the pwn to study any changes in its properties from 2000 to 2006 in the context of the variability detected from the pulsar ( see  [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "the spectroscopic study of psr j1846@xmath10258 and its pwn was carried out in the 0.510 kev energy range using xspec version 12.4.1 .",
    "the spectrum of the pulsar was extracted by selecting a circular region of 2-radius centered on the pulsar ( fig .",
    "1 ) , encompassing 90@xmath22 of the encircled energy .",
    "the background region was selected from an annular ring from 3 to 4 centered on the pulsar to subtract the contamination by the surrounding bright pwn .",
    "the spectrum of the pwn was extracted from a circular region of 18-radius ( fig .",
    "the background was extracted from a source - free region to the north - west of the pulsar .",
    "the spectra extracted were grouped by a minimum of 20 and 50 counts per bin for the 2000 and 2006 data , respectively , and the errors were calculated at the 90@xmath22 confidence level .    a simple absorbed power - law ( pl ) model to the pulsar gave a poor fit due to ccd pileup7edavis / papers / pileup2001.ps ] leading to the artificial flattening of the observed spectrum .",
    "psr j1846@xmath10258 , being a bright source , is affected by pileup with an estimated pileup fraction of @xmath1610@xmath22 for the 2000 data ( h03 ) and 18@xmath22 for the 2006 data . to account for pileup in our analysis",
    ", we included a convolution model ( `` pileup '' ) in xspec .",
    "the resulting model ( fig .",
    "2(a ) , table 1 ) produced an excellent fit .",
    "the spectra were further examined by adding a blackbody ( bb ) component to the model ( after freezing the pl parameters ) to account for any surface thermal emission from the pulsar .",
    "we obtained a bb temperature @xmath45=0.74@xmath46 kev ( @xmath47=8.6@xmath48@xmath310@xmath49 k ) and an unabsorbed thermal flux of ( 4.7@xmath50 erg  @xmath15  s@xmath5 ( 0.510 kev ) , which is only @xmath162@xmath22 of the total non - thermal flux .",
    "however , the current statistics did not allow us to confirm or constrain the additional bb component . using the bb component and assuming isotropic emission",

    "we also independently carried out the spectral analysis of the 2000 data by freezing @xmath55=3.96@xmath310@xmath56 @xmath15 to compare with the values obtained by h03 .",
    "our observed photon index @xmath7=1.32@xmath8 is in good agreement with that obtained by h03 ( @xmath7=1.39@xmath180.04 ) . due to the limited number of counts",
    ", we could not add a bb component to the 2000 data .",
    "the variability of the pulsar s spectrum from 2000 to 2006 is discussed in  [ 4.1 ] .",
    "the pwn is well fitted with an absorbed pl as summarized in table  1 . by comparing the 2000 and the 2006 spectral parameters ,",
    "we note that the pwn s luminosity and photon index have increased by @xmath1611@xmath57@xmath22 and @xmath163@xmath58@xmath22 , respectively ; however within error these changes are not significant .",
    "the pl fit to the pulsar clearly shows a flux enhancement and a spectral softening from 2000 to 2006 ( fig .",
    "2(a ) , table 1 ) . the corresponding increase observed in the luminosity by more than a factor of 6 provides evidence for brightening of the pulsar , suggesting for the first time an activity most likely associated with its ultra - high @xmath24-field .",
    "we now discuss the implications of the observed variations in the spectrum of psr j1846@xmath10258 considered as a crab - like pulsar so far .",
    "firstly , rotation - powered pulsars are known to be steady while psr j1846@xmath10258 has brightened by a factor of 6 , a behavior seen in magnetars .",
    "for example , the transient magnetar xte j1810 - 197 brightened by 2 orders of magnitude in 2003 ( ibrahim et al .",
    "2004 ) ; and the most recently discovered 2-s magnetar , 1e 1547.0@xmath15408 ( camilo et al .",
    "2007 ) , had its x - ray flux vary by a factor of 7 between 1980 and 2006 ( gelfand & gaensler 2007 , halpern et al . 2007 ) .",
    "secondly , the pulsar s spectrum softened as it brightened ( @xmath7 increased from 1.32 to 1.97 ) , indicating a spectral change that could be tied to a change in its @xmath24-field configuration or a magnetar - like burst .",
    "thirdly , there is a hint that the pwn s spectrum has also changed as seen from the increase in its @xmath28 by @xmath1611@xmath22 and a slight softening of its spectrum . while these changes are not significant within error , they support the emergence of a magnetar - like burst from psr  j1846@xmath10258 which would have injected relativistic particles in the pwn , thus enhancing its brightness observed in 2006 .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out by kargaltsev & pavlov ( 2008 ) , it is possible that the unusually high efficiency of the pwn could be explained by a series of magnetar - like bursts .",
    "therefore , based on the observed changes , we conclude that psr  j1846@xmath10258 revealed its identity as a magnetar , likely after a magnetar - like burst .",
    "like the young rotation - powered pulsars , psr j1846@xmath10258 s x - ray spectrum is described by a pl spectrum with a hard photon index , even at its steeper phase ( @xmath7=1.97 ) .",
    "the only 2 magnetars having hard pl x - ray spectra with @xmath7@xmath162 are sgr  1806@xmath120 and sgr  1900 + 14 ( woods & thompson , 2006 ) .",
    "as well , its x - ray efficiency , despite being high in comparison to rotation - powered pulsars , is still smaller than 1  a characteristic that differentiates rotation - powered pulsars from magnetars .",
    "although these properties pose some difficulty in interpreting the pulsar as a newly emerging magnetar , they can be attributed to the pulsar being young and highly energetic . in particular ,",
    "magnetars x - ray luminosities can easily exceed their spin - down luminosity because they have a much lower @xmath2 ( @xmath1610@xmath59 erg s@xmath5 ) , ranging from @xmath166@xmath310@xmath60  erg  s@xmath5 for 1e  2259 + 586 to 5@xmath310@xmath19  erg  s@xmath5 for sgr  1806@xmath120 .",
    "the highest known @xmath2 of a magnetar is that of the 2-s magnetar , 1e 1547.0@xmath15408 , with @xmath2=1.0@xmath310@xmath21  erg  s@xmath5 ( camilo et al .",
    "2007 ) , still @xmath162 orders of magnitude smaller than that of psr j1846@xmath10258 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of 1e 1547.0@xmath15408 only just exceeded its @xmath2 during outburst .",
    "furthermore , magnetars are known to spin down fast to a period of a few seconds in @xmath6110,000 yrs , but psr j1846@xmath10258 is only @xmath61900 years and hence , its @xmath2 ( @xmath62@xmath63 ) is still high .",
    "therefore , based on pure energetic grounds , psr j1846@xmath10258 s rotational energy loss can still power its @xmath28 and the surrounding pwn , like the rotation - powered pulsars . on the other hand , the unusually high x - ray efficiency ( of the pulsar and pwn ) and the variability observed between 2000 and 2006 suggests that at least a fraction of the x - ray luminosity is powered by magnetic energy that would be supplied e.g. during a magnetar - like burst .",
    "finally we note that we can not rule out the possibility that the pulsar s @xmath28 exceeded its @xmath2 prior to the 2006 @xmath0 observations during a magnetar - like burst that was missed by the @xmath0 observations .",
    "of all the hbps , psr j1846@xmath10258 has the highest @xmath2=8.3@xmath310@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ( gotthelf et al .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath64=1.4@xmath22 ( using the 2006 flux from this work ) .",
    "it has spin parameters similar to the hbp psr  j1119@xmath16127 ( @xmath27=407 ms , @xmath31=4@xmath310@xmath12 s s@xmath5 , b=5@xmath310@xmath6 g ; camilo et al . 2000 ) and both pulsars are now believed to be at about the same distance , @xmath65@xmath166 kpc ( gonzalez & safi - harb 2003 , leahy & tian 2008 ) . despite the remarkable similarities between their spin properties",
    ", they have very different x - ray properties .",
    "the resolved spectrum of psr  j1119@xmath16127 is best fitted by a two - component bb+pl model , with the bb component dominating the x - ray emission ( safi - harb & kumar 2007 ) , and characterized by a high pulsed fraction of 74@xmath1814@xmath22 in the 0.52.0 kev ( gonzalez et al . 2005 ) ; however , the emission from psr  j1846@xmath10258 is dominated by a pl model with a hard photon index .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray efficiency of psr j1119@xmath16127 is only @xmath160.05@xmath22 ( safi - harb & kumar 2007 ) , much lower than that of psr j1846@xmath10258 .",
    "moreover , psr j1119@xmath16127 powers a weak pwn ( @xmath660.02@xmath22 , safi - harb & kumar 2007 ) while psr j1846@xmath10258 powers a much brighter pwn ( @xmath661.85@xmath22 ) . while the data presented here show the first evidence of spectral changes from psr  j1846@xmath10258 between 2000 and 2006 , no changes were observed in the @xmath0 data of psr j1119@xmath16127 taken in 2002 & 2004 ( safi - harb & kumar 2007 ) .",
    "these differences indicate that the b - field strength is not the sole parameter that determines their characteristics .",
    "we attribute these differences mainly to their evolutionary state ( psr  j1119@xmath16127 being twice as old and less energetic ) , their different @xmath55 ( psr j846 - 0258 s @xmath55 is at least twice as high as psr j1119@xmath16127 s thus burying any soft bb component ) , and likely different progenitor stars .",
    "morton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggests that kes 75 could have resulted from the rare explosion of a wolf - rayet star during a type ib or ic event .",
    "furthermore , psr  j1846@xmath10258 has revealed its magnetar - like nature only now . since",
    "two transient magnetars have now been observed in the radio ( camilo et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) , monitoring of psr  j1846@xmath10258 in the radio and other wavelengths will shed more light on its magnetar nature . as well , monitoring of psr  j1119@xmath16127 in the x - ray may reveal in the future a magnetar - like activity as observed for psr j1846@xmath10258 , and as recently inferred for 1e  1547.0 - 5408 ( gelfand & gaensler 2007 ) .",
    "we have used the archival @xmath0 data to carry out a spectroscopic study of the hbp psr  j1846@xmath10258 , classified as a crab - like pulsar , and its pwn in the 0.510 kev energy band .",
    "our analysis of the pulsar s spectrum revealed flux enhancement by a factor of more than 6 and x - ray softening from 2000 to 2006 , accompanied by a hint of flux enhancement of the pwn .",
    "this provides the first observational evidence of a magnetar - like emission associated with this hbp .",
    "it is still intriguing that the x - ray luminosity , even at its observed peak , did not exceed the pulsar s rotational energy power , suggesting that spin - down can energetically power the x - ray emission from the pulsar and its pwn .",
    "further observations of this source at all wavelengths and monitoring of other hbps will answer the question whether hbps are indeed transient magnetars disguised in other forms , and will shed more light on the nature of these sources and their link to magnetars and the rotation - powered pulsars .",
