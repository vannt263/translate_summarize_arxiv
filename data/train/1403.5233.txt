    "alignment mechanisms are present in many biological and physical systems such as self - propelled particles or rod - like polymers .",
    "one of the relevant questions in the study of such systems is to know whether the interactions between individuals allow the whole system to become globally aligned .",
    "one can then talk about flocking , long range polarization , magnetization , etc .",
    "depending on the context . in this work",
    "we investigate a simple kinetic model with an alignment mechanism for which this flocking behaviour can be rigorously exhibited .",
    "we consider an infinite number of individuals / particles structured by their orientation in the unit sphere of  @xmath0 .",
    "the model we consider here is homogeneous in the sense that the density of particles is not spatially structured .",
    "we assume that all particles interact with the same probability , and when they do , their new orientation is the average orientation of the particles prior to the interaction .",
    "the rate at which a particle is chosen to interact with another one is constant ( equal to 1 ) and independent of the particle .",
    "notice that when the interacting particles have opposite directions , their `` average direction '' is not well - defined .",
    "their new orientations are then chosen at random on the corresponding equator ( the set of directions orthogonal to the initial opposite directions ) .",
    "this model is related to the boltzmann - like model of bertin , droz and grgoire  @xcite in which self - propelled particles interact and tend to align .",
    "when two particles interact , they align following the process described above , and their orientation is then subject to angular noise .",
    "the model we consider here is then a kinetic model corresponding to the spatially homogeneous version of this model , when no noise is present in the system .",
    "the links between the kinetic model and the underlying individual based model have been studied in  @xcite . in this study , we will focus on the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to the spatially homogeneous kinetic model .",
    "it is indeed well known that the study of spatially inhomogeneous boltzmann - type models is a much harder problem , and the analysis of such equations ( through hydrodynamic limits , for instance ) requires a good understanding of the corresponding homogeneous model . from the modeling point of view , the study of such models is also a step towards the understanding of more realistic models based on the fact that birds in a flock interact with a limited number of congeners  @xcite .",
    "the model of  @xcite is intended to mimic the vicsek alignment model  @xcite . while the model of  @xcite relies on a binary interaction point of view , that of vicsek describes multiple simultaneous interactions .",
    "the corresponding kinetic model is of mean - field type and takes the form of a fokker ",
    "planck equation  @xcite .",
    "equilibria of this fokker  planck model have been studied in  @xcite in the space - homogeneous case , and the non - spatially homogeneous case is addressed in  @xcite .",
    "we then consider two generalizations of the model .",
    "the first generalization that we will consider is a more general `` position space '' to describe the orientation of the particles . from the modeling point of view , it is indeed interesting to consider more complex position spaces .",
    "the main example we have in mind concerns elongated particles which have an orientation ( that can be seen as a point on the unit sphere ) , but are symmetrical with respect to their center of mass .",
    "a particle with a given orientation is the indistinguishable from a particle with the opposite direction , so that those particles are indeed characterized by a `` position '' that is a point on the sphere quotiented by  @xmath1 .",
    "the alignment dynamics is also affected : the particles try to align to neighboring particles , but possibly with opposite directions .",
    "a good modeling choice then seems to describe the dynamics of the particles as points on the riemannian manifold formed by the sphere quotiented by  @xmath1 .",
    "this assumption has for instance been chosen to model the alignment dynamics of fish in  @xcite , leading to possible contra - rotating mills ( that have indeed been observed on natural populations ) .",
    "a second example is flocking birds , that do not only copy their neighbors orientation , but also their posture ( in particular the angular orientation of their wings ) .",
    "it can then be interesting to characterize the position of the birds through a more complicated manifold .",
    "we will thus extend our result on the local stability of dirac masses to alignment models on general riemannian manifolds . in that case , the interaction between two particles consists in updating their position at the midpoint of the minimal geodesic joining their `` positions '' prior to the interaction .",
    "the second generalization that we make is to relax our assumptions on the outcome of the interactions : instead of assuming that the two interacting particles align perfectly , we merely assume that the interaction brings them closer .",
    "when the space of positions is the euclidean space  @xmath0 ,  @xmath2 , the model we study here is related to several other models from physics of sociology .",
    "we can for instance mention the inelastic boltzmann equation  @xcite , used for instance to model granular gases , or the simpler kac inelastic model  @xcite .",
    "this type of model also appears in socio - physical models  @xcite , or wealth redistribution models in agent - based markets @xcite .",
    "finally , such models appear in biology , to model the effect of recombination in sexual population ( in the so - called infinitesimal model )  @xcite , or the exchange of proteins between cells  @xcite . in all those works , the fact that the `` position space '' is  @xmath0 allows the development of powerful methods . in particular , the center of mass is conserved , and it is possible to define an energy that is decreasing for any initial condition .",
    "moreover , thanks to the geometry of the position space , it is possible to use fourier - based methods as well as the convexity properties obtained thanks to optimal transport methods ( see  @xcite for a synthetic description of those methods ) .",
    "it is then possible to obtain precise descriptions of the dynamics of solutions .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that the properties and methods listed above fail on more general spaces of positions , such as spheres , as we consider in this article .",
    "one could hope that the fourier transform methods introduced for e. g. the kac model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) could be reproduced in the case of spheres using spherical harmonics .",
    "this approach is currently under investigation in the case of the unit circle , see  @xcite , but it appears that severe difficulties arise compared to the euclidian situation .",
    "the main result of this article is that the solutions of the kinetic model we consider converge exponentially fast to a dirac mass , provided the initial condition is close to a dirac mass ( in the sense of the 2-wasserstein distance ) .",
    "we first provide a proof of the main result in the case of the so - called midpoint model on a sphere ( which is the simplest model for alignment in our setting ) , in order to keep the technicality of the proof to a minimum .",
    "once our main result is proven in this simple case , we show that this initial proof can actually be extended to general riemannian manifolds , thanks to some geometrical arguments that we detail .",
    "finally , we show that more general interactions can be considered , thanks to additional geometrical arguments that we provide .",
    "the main difficulty of our study is the absence of conserved quantities which would help to locate the asymptotic final dirac mass , and that could play the role of the center of mass in the inelastic boltzmann equation .",
    "similarly , we do not believe there exists an energy functional that would decrease in time for any initial condition .",
    "this lack of conserved quantities and global lyapunov functional is common in models describing biological systems .",
    "it is however sometimes possible for such models to prove the convergence of a solution to a stationary profile in large time , even if it is not possible to determine which specific asymptotic profile will be selected  @xcite .",
    "a second difficulty of the model comes from the geometry of the position space , which seems to prevent the use of arguments based on convexity .",
    "the main argument we use in our analysis is an energy adapted to the problem , which is a lyapunov functional provided the initial condition is sufficiently close to a dirac mass . to prove that this energy is actually decreasing , we introduce some local and global estimates regarding the microscopic variation of this energy .",
    "those estimates require a good understanding of the geometry of the problem , involving a positive injectivity radius and bounds on the curvature of the manifold .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ section - model ] , we define the kinetic model and discuss its well - posedness .",
    "we detail the case of the midpoint model on the euclidean space  @xmath0 , for which the convergence towards a dirac mass can be easily proven , and we detail the difficulties appearing for more general position sets , describing in particular the case where the position space is the circle  @xmath3 . in section  [ section : midpoint - sphere ] , we prove our main result in the case of the midpoint model on the unit sphere of  @xmath0 . in section  [ section : manifold ] , we extend this result to the case of a general riemannian manifold .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : non - midpoint ] , we define the notion of contracting models , and we extend our main result to this wider class of models .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of a set of particles , represented at each time  @xmath4 by a probability measure  @xmath5 over a set of positions  @xmath6 .",
    "see section  [ section : intro ] for typical examples of position sets .",
    "the position set is here a complete connected riemannian manifold  @xmath7 , endowed with the geodesic distance  @xmath8 .",
    "the particles collide , and the effect of the collisions is described by a collision kernel  @xmath9 : given two pre - collisional positions  @xmath10 in  @xmath7 , the law of the post - collisional position of the particles is the probability law  @xmath11 on  @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the rate at which a particle is colliding with another is constant equal to  @xmath12 , and that particles collide independently of their positions .",
    "since additionally we consider an infinite number of particles , the model we are interested in is the following , where the unknown  @xmath13 is the probability density of finding particles at time  @xmath14 and position  @xmath15 : @xmath16 where we use the abusive notation  @xmath17 instead of  @xmath18 . when no confusion is possible",

    "we will however not try to relax the assumption  [ ass : h2 ] in the present work .",
    "finally , let us present some simple collision kernels that satisfy the properties stated in this subsection       * the midpoint model ( see assumption  [ ass - k1 ] ) satisfies assumption  [ ass : contraction ] with  @xmath393 , assumption  [ ass : h2 ] with  @xmath427 , and assumption  [ ass : h3 ] with  @xmath428 , for any  @xmath423 .",

    "this is the price to pay for the lower contractivity of the collision model .    just as in section",
    "[ section : manifold ] , the proof of theorem  [ theo - stability - dirac ] is very similar to the proof of theorem  [ theo - stability - dirac - midpoint - m ] , and we will only emphasize the changes .",

    ".    then  @xmath452 .",
    "we then start with the case of the hyperbolic plane with constant curvature  @xmath453 , and as before we will obtain the general case by scaling and comparison .",

    "the proof relies mainly in two applications of lemma  [ lem - apollonius - estimate - m - positive ] , one application of lemma  [ lem - apollonius - estimate - m - negative ] , and some markov inequalities using the control provided by assumption  [ ass : h3 ] on higher moments .",
