    "longer geodesics correspond in general to smaller values of @xmath33 , so this limitation restricts our attention to @xmath33 on the order of @xmath133 .",
    "one area where we can gain efficiency is in grouping the elements of @xmath118 according to multiplicities .",
    "the length spectrum @xmath15 of a hyperbolic surface was shown to have unbounded multiplicities by randol @xcite .",
    "more recently , ginzburg - rudnick @xcite investigated the length spectrum multiplicity problem for the case of a free group @xmath19 on two generators @xmath134 , e.g.  a classical schottky group with @xmath125 .",

    "words with greater multiplicity can be formed by applying these symmetry operations to composite words .    according to (",
    "* conjecture  1 ) , this should be a complete list of operations that preserve the length class .",

    "we first compute a multiplicity table breaking down @xmath115 into length classes .",
    "this is done simply by computing lengths for all elements of @xmath115 for a few different sets of generators and then correlating the results .",
    "since the groups are freely generated , the structure of the length classes depends only on the number of generators .",

    "closer to @xmath45 these oscillations become much more severe , so that numerical integration of @xmath149 over long intervals is extremely slow and prone to errors .",
    "another issue with this approach is that the numerical routines often fail when poles are close to the path . in regions with a high density of poles , accurate estimation of the integrals",
    "requires adjustments to the paths to avoid poles .",
    "logzp.pdf    we have found that a much faster and more stable approach to the application of the argument principle is subdivide the sample region into a rectangular grid . along each short horizontal or vertical segment in the grid , we sample @xmath14 at a finely - spaced sequence of points @xmath150 , and then compute @xmath151 we can efficiently compute the resonance counts in a rectangular bin array by first using this sampling approach to obtain @xmath152 on all of the horizontal and vertical edge segments . for the sampling we specify a minimum spacing , typically 0.01 , as well as a minimum number of samples per edge , but otherwise the samples are spaced uniformly .",
    "the stability of the method is easily checked by counting zeros in the same region with varying bin shapes and sizes .",
    "the method yields correct results even when zeros lie extremely close to the edges of the bins , so we are able to avoid the issue of adjusting paths to avoid poles .    for the resonance plots shown in figure  [ resplot101.fig ] and below , we start by producing a bin count with a very fine mesh , so that each bin is roughly the size of a pixel in the final plot .",
    "then for each bin with a positive count , we locate the corresponding zero using a standard root - finding algorithm , with seed point furnished by the center of the bin .",
    "although bins with multiple resonances are possibly underrepresented by this technique , this has no impact on the plot because the resulting points would be superimposed and indistinguishable .",
