    "understanding the equation of state of macromolecules in solution has been a longstanding problem of polymer science , which is both important as a fundamental problem in the statistical mechanics of soft matter  @xcite and relevant for various applications of polymers .",
    "the interplay of excluded volume effects  @xcite , solvent quality and variable chain stiffness  @xcite already is very difficult to describe for macromolecules in very dilute solution  @xcite , withstanding an analytic solution and making the application of computer simulation methods  @xcite necessary .",
    "the experimental situation on measurements of the equation of state of polymer solutions is addressed in chapter @xmath0 of ref .   and chapter @xmath1 of ref .  .",
    "considering semidilute and concentrated solutions , the enthalpic and/or entropic interactions among the polymer chains create nontrivial correlations in the structure of the solutions involving many chains , and phase transitions such as phase separation under bad solvent conditions into a dilute polymer solution and a concentrated one may occur  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , under good solvent conditions one may observe for semiflexible or for stiff chains a transition from an isotropic to a nematic solution when the polymer concentration increases  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the situation when nematic ordering and the tendency to phase separation under bad solvent conditions compete  @xcite .",
    "preliminary computer simulation studies of a corresponding model  @xcite gave only rather rough information on the phase behavior , and it was concluded that the accuracy with which the osmotic equation of state could be determined needs to be improved .",
    "thus , there are many reasons why establishing methods that allow the reliable estimation of the equation of state for various coarse - grained lattice models for polymers is of interest . while in an off - lattice model the estimation of the pressure tensor from the virial theorem in principle",
    "is straightforward  @xcite , it often is not possible to study very large systems with the desirable accuracy  @xcite , and hence simulations of lattice models still have their place  @xcite .",
    "however , for lattice models different techniques to calculate the osmotic pressure of polymers in solution must be sought in order to derive their equation of state .",
    "the standard method , particularly valuable for dilute solutions and/or not too large chain lengths , calculates the chemical potential from the insertion probability of a test chain  @xcite and the osmotic pressure then follows from standard thermodynamic integration  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , insertion of a polymer chain into a volume containing already other chains is very difficult due to very small acceptance probabilities , and hence requires advanced monte carlo methods  @xcite to be practically feasible .    as an alternative method dickman",
    "@xcite proposed the repulsive wall thermodynamic integration ( rwti ) method , which remains applicable also for very dense systems since it works in the canonic ( @xmath2 ) ensemble , where the number of chains @xmath3 in the box remains fixed .",
    "however , this method requires substantial simulation effort , since for each state point in the bulk several simulation runs with increasing wall ",
    "monomer repulsion and subsequent thermodynamic integration need to be performed .",
    "moreover the rwti method may suffer from important finite size effects  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was proposed  @xcite to extract the osmotic equation of state from monte carlo simulations where the equilibrium monomer and center - of - mass concentration profiles of lattice polymers in a gravitation - like potential are computed . from these concentration profiles ,",
    "the equation of state can be inferred if a local density approximation like in hydrostatic equilibrium is invoked .",
    "this method has been broadly applied to study the sedimentation equilibrium of colloidal dispersions containing spherical  @xcite , rod - like  @xcite or disk - like  @xcite particles .",
    "more recently , successful applications to colloid - polymer mixtures  @xcite and solutions of block copolymers  @xcite or binary polymer solutions  @xcite have been made as well .    despite these successes , this `` sedimentation equilibrium '' ( se ) method also may have drawbacks , when other large length scales appear in the system , that compete with the characteristic `` sedimentation length '' .",
    "this length that scales inversely with the `` gravitational constant '' characterizing the gravitation - like potential and hence can be made arbitrarily large  @xcite , but the linear dimension of the simulated system in the @xmath4-direction in which this gravitation - like force acts must then be huge , also . a well - known case , where even the real gravitation potential on earth substantially disturbs the equation of state is a fluid very close to the gas - liquid critical point  @xcite , since there the correlation length of density fluctuations diverges , and critical fluctuations undisturbed by gravity can occur in the @xmath5-directions perpendicular to the gravitational force only  @xcite .",
    "other cases , apart from critical points of second - order transitions , where large length scales arise that are potentially disturbed by the gravitation - like potential are associated with the formation of thick wetting layers at walls , for instance .    while addison at al .",
    "@xcite did test the se method against the rwti method for a few cases varying the solvent quality from good solvents to theta solvents , finding good agreement , they considered only fully flexible chains . thus , we take up this problem but rather consider semiflexible chains as well : the possible occurrence of nematically ordered wetting layers at the wall where the density is largest  @xcite or even the occurrence of the isotropic to nematic transition in the bulk solution of the semiflexible or stiff polymers may complicate matters .",
    "the aim of the present work is to carefully test the se method against both the rwti method and the standard thermodynamic integration method in the grand canonical @xmath6 ensemble ( ti@xmath6 method , @xmath7 denoting the chemical potential ) , and to assess by detailed comparisons both the efficiency and the accuracy of these methods . as has been explained above ,",
    "there is need for accurate simulation methods for the computation of the equation of state of polymer solutions in the context of various interesting problems .",
    "the plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "we consider a system of chains of length @xmath8 in a simulation box of volume @xmath9 with periodic boundary conditions ( typically the box has a cubic shape , @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the linear dimension ) at given temperature @xmath12 and chemical potential @xmath7 of the chains .",
    "the density of polymer chains in the system , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the average number of chains contained in the simulation box then is an output of the simulation .    utilizing the standard relations in the canonical ensemble , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the free energy of the system and @xmath18 the pressure ,",

    "( [ pii ] ) is negligible ; and an efficient grand canonical simulation method is needed , so @xmath25 is sampled with sufficient accuracy . for not too long chains and not too high densities , however , the method is indeed practically useful , and since periodic boundary conditions are used , the system for large @xmath9 always is homogeneous , and the analysis is not hampered by any interfacial effects , which are present inevitably in the other techniques described below due to their explicit use of walls .",
    "this method can be implemented both in the grand canonical @xmath6 ensemble and in the canonical @xmath2 ensemble .",
    "while the latter choice has the advantage that no chain insertions are necessary and hence the method also works for long chains and at high densities , it suffers from rather large finite size effects  @xcite .",
    "we have used here both the canonical and the grand canonical version of the method .",
    "one considers now a box of linear dimensions @xmath31 , with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath32 and @xmath33 directions only , while a hard wall is placed both at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , one introduces a repulsive potential of strength @xmath36 which acts in the first layer adjacent to @xmath34 and in the last layer available to the monomers , @xmath35 . as discussed in  @xcite , the osmotic pressure",

    "it is also useful to introduce characteristic gravitational lengths @xmath47 @xmath48 as shown by addison et al .",
    "@xcite , for large @xmath4 the density profile of an ideal gas of monomers at the lattice would follow the standard barometric formula , @xmath49 , while for an ideal gas of polymer chains the density profile of monomer units @xmath50 .",
    "while the variation of the density profile for large @xmath4 , where the system is very dilute and the ideal gas behavior holds , hence is trivially known , and this knowledge is an important consistency check of the method , for smaller @xmath4 the density profile is nontrivial . but from this profile the osmotic equation of state can be estimated , when one invokes the local density approximation , such that the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium holds  @xcite @xmath51 @xmath52 being the local osmotic pressure at altitude @xmath4",
    ". integration of eq.([osmloc ] ) yields @xmath53    thus one can record both @xmath54 ( and the associated monomer profile @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 simultaneously , and eliminating @xmath4 from these relations one obtains the desired equation of state @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 , respectively ) .    noting that in the local density approximation we expect that the density distribution of the monomer units satisfies @xmath59 , we find from eqs .",
    "( [ grlength ] ) , ( [ osmse ] ) that @xmath56 can also be written as @xmath60    however , the validity of the local density approximation needs to be considered carefully .",
    "e.g. , near the hard wall at @xmath34 , @xmath55 may exhibit strong oscillations ( `` layering '' ) , and also @xmath54 exhibits a nontrivial structure .",
    "thus it is clear that the local density approximation breaks down near the hard wall at @xmath34 , and in fact one should use eqs .",
    "( [ osmse]),([osmse2 ] ) only for @xmath61 , the gyration radius of the chains .",
    "similarly , rapid density variations invalidating the local density approximation are also expected near an interface between coexisting phases ( as it may occur for bad solvent conditions , for instance ) .",
    "in addition , one must require that on the scale of @xmath62 the change of the potential , eq .",
    "( [ extpot ] ) , is negligibly small .",
    "this implies @xmath63 for flexible chains , @xmath64 scales like @xmath65 in concentrated solutions , while for stiff chains we have @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that for stiff chains considerably larger values of @xmath67 ( and hence smaller values of @xmath45 ) need to be chosen than for flexible ones .",
    "of course , since one must accommodate in the simulation box the full density profile from a value appropriate for concentrated solutions near @xmath34 down to the dilute regime near @xmath35 , a linear dimension @xmath68 is mandatory ; otherwise , the distortion of the density profile due to this upper boundary at @xmath35 leads to systematic errors as well .",
    "thus , the se method requires a careful choice of simulation parameters to avoid such errors and ensure the desired very good accuracy , and the large size @xmath69 in @xmath4-direction to some extent will reduce the advantage , that the whole equation of state can be estimated from a single run .",
    "finally we note that the approach can be generalized to other forms of the external potential @xmath70 , different from a gravitation - like potential .",
    "e.g. , if one uses @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an exponent different from one , the equation for the force balance at height @xmath4 \\{eq .",
    "[ osmloc ] } gets modified as @xmath73 and hence @xmath74    motivation for using different potentials can be experiments made in a centrifuge .",
    "the centrifugal force depends linearly on the distance from the center of rotation , so that @xmath75 for this case .",
    "although it is not clear at this point which choice for the exponent @xmath72 is optimal , testing that the equation of state @xmath76 thus obtained does not depend on @xmath72 is a nice consistency check .",
    "we use the bond fluctuation model  @xcite on the simple cubic lattice , taking henceforth @xmath77 as our unit of length .",
    "each effective monomeric unit is represented by an elementary cube of the lattice , blocking all 8 sites at the corners of this cube from further occupation , realizing thus the excluded volume interaction between the monomers .",
    "the bond vectors can be taken from the set @xmath78 , including also all permutations between these coordinates ,  altogether 108 different bond vectors occur , which leads to 87 different angles between successive bonds . to model the chain stiffness ,",
    "an intramolecular potential depending on the angle @xmath79 between two successive bond vectors along the chain is introduced ( bending energy ) , and also an energy term depending on the bond length @xmath80 can be included  @xcite , @xmath81 both the stiffness parameter @xmath82 and @xmath83 are measured in units of @xmath84 .",
    "note that for the model with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 the isotropic to nematic transition has been studied by extensive monte carlo simulations previously  @xcite , and in order to be able to compare the present results to previous work we have included this bond length energy term here again .",
    "note that variable solvent quality can be modeled by including also a square well potential between any pair of monomers , @xmath89 as done in refs .  .",
    "however , the present work will treat the case @xmath90 only , our analysis of the phase behavior when both @xmath82 and @xmath91 are nonzero is deferred to a later work .",
    "for the runs in the @xmath2 ensemble ( for the rwti and se methods ) we define two monte carlo steps ( mcs ) to involve one attempt to perform a local `` random hopping '' move per each monomer unit in the system  @xcite and one attempt of a slithering - snake move per chain .",
    "these are the standard moves for simulations using the bond fluctuation model  @xcite in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the chain length used was @xmath92 throughout , while typical box sizes were @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the rwti method and @xmath95 for the se method , respectively . for the se method ,",
    "a typical system contained @xmath96 chains , and about @xmath97 mcs were needed to get a reasonably well equilibrated density profile . for the rwti method ,",
    "the number of chains in the box was varied from very small number up to about @xmath98 .",
    "again typically @xmath97 mcs per run were used , taking @xmath99 `` measurements '' in each run , with @xmath100 mcs between two successive measurements ( it was checked that these @xmath99 configurations then were uncorrelated ) .    for the runs in the @xmath6 ensemble ,",
    "one monte carlo step means one configurational bias move  @xcite plus additionally either one attempt to perform a local random hopping move of every effective monomer in the system or one attempt of a slithering - snake move per chain . for the ti@xmath6 method , about 5060 different values of the chemical potential were used , and the box size was @xmath93 . for each parameter combination",
    "@xmath101 mcs were taken .",
    "the maximum value of the number of chains reached was about @xmath102 ( this corresponds to the polymer volume fraction of about @xmath103 in this simulation box ) .",
    "so the total number of mcs needed to record the equation of state is of the order of @xmath104 mcs ( but note that 1 mcs needs an amount of cpu time which depends on the number of chains @xmath14 in the system ) .",
    "since it is well known  @xcite that in the @xmath2 ensemble the equilibration of long wavelength density fluctuations is very slow , suffering from `` hydrodynamic slowing down ''  @xcite , it is useful to take special precautions that the density profiles in the rwti are well equilibrated , in order to avoid uncontrolled errors . therefore for each value of the repulsive wall parameter @xmath39 \\{cf .",

    "@xmath101 steps were used for this grand canonical equilibration stage . then the configurational bias moves were stopped , and the @xmath2 run with the measurement of the number of monomers @xmath105 adjacent to the walls began .    in the configurational bias moves , one needs to utilize a biased chain insertion method to let a polymer `` grow '' successively into the system . at each step",
    "all possible 108 bond vectors from the current effective monomer are examined , and a position for inserting the next monomeric unit along the chain is chosen , respecting the excluded volume condition , and using the boltzmann weight calculated from the intramolecular energy , eq .",
    "( [ estiff ] ) .",
    "the statistical weight of the generated polymer configuration hence is easily calculated recursively , and thus the bias can be accounted for in the acceptance probability for the move .    in our simulations",
    ", we have recorded standard single - chain characteristics such as the mean - square end - to - end distance @xmath106 and the mean - square gyration radius @xmath64 of the chains ( @xmath107 are positions of monomers , @xmath108 is the position of the center of mass ) ,    @xmath109    from the runs in the @xmath6 ensemble .",
    "note that these quantities depend on the polymer volume fraction @xmath110 in the system , or the average density of monomer units @xmath111 .",
    "the average @xmath112 extends over all chains and all generated system configurations . in the se method , where we have a density profile from a rather large density near @xmath34 to almost zero at @xmath35 , we expect that the radii @xmath113 will depend distinctly on the height @xmath114 of the center of mass of a chain , and hence this information could only be obtained with substantially reduced statistical accuracy . in the rwti method , one can estimate the radii as well if one restricts the averaging to chains with center of mass coordinate @xmath108 sufficiently remote from the walls .",
    "we start by comparing results obtained from the rwti method with results obtained from the thermodynamic integration in the grand canonical ensemble ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the results of both methods actually is excellent ( relative deviations are smaller than @xmath115 , and the statistical error for all data points obtained by both methods was also always less than 1% ) .",
    "also the old data by deutsch and dickman  @xcite , which clearly are considerably less accurate , agree with the present calculation to within a few percent .",
    "an essential consideration for the ti@xmath6 method is that the values of @xmath7 for which calculations are performed must be so closely spaced that the probability distributions @xmath116 at neighboring choices of @xmath7 overlap strongly .",
    "this condition has been carefully checked .",
    "note , however , that the effort in cpu resources to generate the full equation of state @xmath117 in fig .  [ fig1 ] with the ti@xmath6 method is comparable to the effort for a single point on the equation of state in the rwti method .",
    "therefore we restrained our efforts to the accurate calculation of two state points with this method only .",
    "[ fig2 ] now compares the results obtained with the se method with those of the ti@xmath6 method , and again we find perfect agreement .",

    "( [ dextpot ] ) } is safely fulfilled , but nevertheless it is important to check that no visible systematic error of the se method is present ( to our knowledge , it is not known in which order of @xmath123 systematic corrections due to the gradient in density should be expected ) . as expected , we see some increase of the random statistical error with increasing @xmath124 , but the absolute magnitude of this error always stays clearly below @xmath125 , and the relative error is between 1% and 2% .    thus we confirm the conclusion of addison et al .",
    "@xcite , for a different model than studied in their work , that the se method can yield a reliable estimation of the equation of state . however , care has to be exerted that parameters such as the height @xmath69 of the simulation box and the strength of the external potential @xmath45 are chosen appropriately , and also the statistical effort needs to be large enough . figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] contain examples of the problems that one encounters when these conditions are not met .",
    "e.g. , when the potential is chosen too weak for the chosen size @xmath69 ( and number of chains @xmath14 ) , so that the density profile ( we plot here and below profiles of the polymer volume fraction @xmath124 ) is slightly affected by the hard wall at @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) , a systematic depression of @xmath117 in the ideal gas region ( where simply @xmath126 must hold ) is found ( see fig .  [",
    "conversely , when the statistics does not suffice , or equilibration time was too short so that the asymptotic behavior of the density profile ( see eq .  [ barom ] below ) has not been reached , one can also get an overestimation of the pressure in this region .",
    "interestingly , even such data that are invalid in the ideal gas region still merge rather well at larger volume fractions , indicating the robustness of the se method in this regime .",
    "it is also remarkable that the strong layering found for the potential proportional to @xmath127 near the wall for @xmath128 ( and the subsequent rather rapid decrease of the density towards zero ) do not create any problems , however .",
    "[ fig4 ] , on the other hand , shows a case ( @xmath75 in the potential eq .",

    "[ fig4]b ) is too steeply varying , and then it is very likely that the local density approximation in no longer accurate .",
    "consequently , it is no surprise that the osmotic pressure comes out systematically too large ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "however , the choice @xmath75 , @xmath130 is again in very good agreement with the result obtained for the potential eq .",
    "( [ extpot ] ) with @xmath118 ( which also agrees with the ti@xmath6 results , as noted above ) .",
    "the finding that the three potentials , which lead to very different density profiles , nevertheless yield the same result for the equation of state @xmath117 is a very clear evidence that the local density approximation is valid , for the chosen set of parameters .    fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] presents then a comparison of the monomer density profiles for the cases where the se method yields correct results .",

    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the linear variation of the bending energy with @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a indicates that the bending energy is already fully `` saturated '' , i.e. an energetic minimum is reached .",

    "[ fig7]a ) .",
    "the variation of the constant @xmath134 with @xmath82 does not have an immediately obvious interpretation , however . in order to interpret this behavior analytically ,",
    "we have estimated @xmath134 applying approximate single chain partition functions in terms of the independent trimer , quadrumer and pentamer approximations  @xcite .",
    "one can see ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]b ) that these approximations follow the same trend as our fit to the numerical data , but clearly the convergence of these approximations to the numerical result from the simulation is rather slow . obviously , the constant @xmath136 reflects a delicate interplay between excluded volume and chain stiffness contributions to the single chain entropy that this constant measures .",
    "knowing @xmath141 we obtain @xmath142 , which is needed for the thermodynamic integration to obtain the pressure \\{eqs .",
    "( [ press])([pii])}. the result is presented in fig .",
    "one sees that the variation of chain stiffness at not too large volume fractions has surprisingly little effect on the equation of state , despite the strong change in chain extensions ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) and structure , and the decrease in the entropy of the chains ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we note that the osmotic pressure for semiflexible chains gets slightly enhanced , in comparison to the fully flexible ones , as soon as one reaches a volume fraction of about @xmath143 , where the first deviations from the ideal gas law @xmath144 occur ( fig .",
    "[ fig9]b ) . for large @xmath124 ,",
    "however , only the data for not so large @xmath82 lie above the curve for @xmath145 , while e.g. the data for @xmath139 lie below those for @xmath145 if @xmath146 .",
    "this implies that at large enough @xmath124 the variation of @xmath147 with @xmath82 is non - monotonic : @xmath147 increases first , and then decreases again .",
    "presumably this decrease reflects the onset of a nematic short range order  small clusters of stretched chains oriented more or less in parallel take less free volume than randomly oriented ones , and hence lead to a decrease of osmotic pressure .",
    "of course , this interpretation of the pressure maximum as function of @xmath82 is highly speculative , and a clear answer must await a careful analysis of the isotropic - nematic transition in this model .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows that our techniques are suitable to locate the transition .",
    "here we first consider the case @xmath85 , @xmath86 , which was studied in our previous work on the isotropic ",
    "nematic transition for this model  @xcite .",
    "although one expects this transition to be weakly of first order , and hence the @xmath117 curve should have a small two - phase coexistence region , it turns out that for these values of parameters the width of this two - phase coexistence region is unmeasurably small , on the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] it can not be resolved .",

    "[ fig17]b we present the two - dimensional @xmath183-map of the coarse - grained order parameter profile for this system using red , green and blue colors to represent the average local orientation of monomer units along @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath4 axes , respectively ( the details of the calculation method can be found in ref . ) . from both these figures ( fig .",
    "[ fig17]a and  [ fig17]b ) one can see that the wall stabilizes rather thick domains of the nematically ordered phase .",
    "one can observe a kink in the z - dependence of the density profile exactly between the two coexisting bulk densities of the isotropic - nematic transition .",
    "the order parameter , however , starts to rise significantly before the limiting isotropic density in the bulk is reached and has a value around @xmath184 at this density , whereas the corresponding bulk value is close to zero .",
    "the order parameter profile appears strongly rounded and slightly shifted with respect to the bulk simulations .",
    "these effects prevent an exact localization of the values of density and order parameter at the isotropic - nematic transition by the se method .",
    "the rounding of the transition is unavoidable and mainly due to the presence of capillary wave excitations of the interface@xcite , which would even increase in magnitude upon an increase of the lateral dimension of the simulation box@xcite , in contrast to the grand canonical bulk simulations where one can reduce finite size effects by increasing the system size .",
    "the slight shift of the transition in the order parameter profile as opposed to the density profile is an indication of a precursor of a nematic wetting layer at the hard wall .",

    "[ fig17]a and figs .  [ fig13]a and  [ fig13]c , respectively .",

    "it should be emphasized that both in the isotropic and nematic phases outside the hysteresis region the curves for both methods coincide with each other indicating that the se method reproduces the properties of nematic phase correctly despite the vicinity of a hard wall",
    ".    the inevitable presence of the interface leads to a smoothing of the first order transition on the pressure vs. density dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig14]a ) . in this figure both",
    "the data for the se method are presented using different values of @xmath69 and @xmath45 , as well as the data for the ti@xmath6 method which we have already discussed above .",
    "it is clear from the principle of the se method that it is impossible to observe any hysteresis on the equation of state .",
    "[ fig14]a shows that the @xmath117 curves generated by the se method start to deviate from those generated by ti@xmath6 method near @xmath185 , while for @xmath186 the agreement between both methods is excellent as well as for @xmath187 ( these parts are not shown here ) .",
    "all curves for the se method obtained at different values of @xmath69 and @xmath45 almost coincide with each other ( a variation of the lateral box linear dimension @xmath11 has no detectable effect on se results ) except for one data set shown with small filled squares ( @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig14]b the density profiles are presented and the reason for the deviation of the one data set becomes apparent : this is the only curve where the isotropic  nematic interface ( which shows up as a characteristic kink in the density profile ) appears very close to the hard wall ( note that for @xmath178 the end - to - end distance of a chain is @xmath191 ( fig . 8) and the chains are already rather stretched ( fig .",
    "12b ) ) so that layering effects influence the isotropic ",
    "nematic coexistence in this case significantly .",
    "the effect of the layering at the wall , which can be quite strong ( see fig .",
    "[ fig14]b ) on the equation of state in the isotropic regime decreases with increasing distance of the isotropic - nematic interface from the wall , such that the curves for the se method in ( fig .",
    "[ fig14]a ) already coincide within our error bars .",
    "note also , that the ordinate of the kink in the density profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig14]b is the same for all systems at different parameters . for the bulk simulation ( the ti@xmath6 data ) for different systems presented in fig .",
    "[ fig14]a we can conclude that there exists an incommensurability effect which influences the equation of state : large open circles show the well equilibrated data obtained in the cubic box @xmath192 , @xmath154 ( box 1 , see also above ) , and the hysteresis region is different from the one obtained for @xmath175 , @xmath193 ( box 2 ) shown with stars and large open squares .",
    "finally , we mention here a scaling of the density profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( for details see the figure caption ) which is also in agreement with results obtained in ref .. the curves superimpose for the systems where the combination of parameters @xmath194 has the same value .",
    "the curves for larger values of @xmath194 look broader and smoother in these scaled variables @xmath195 vs. @xmath196 and show up the kink ( isotropic  nematic interface ) further away from the hard wall .",
    "it is interesting to compare our conclusion on the shift of isotropic ",
    "nematic transition with the results of computer simulation studies of hard rod colloidal suspensions in confinements , i.e. solutions confined between hard walls and/or exposed to an external gravitational potential .",
    "a shift of the isotropic  nematic transition to lower densities as compared to the bulk was found for a hard - rod fluid confined by two walls@xcite . at the same time , a surprisingly good agreement between two osmotic equations of state for hard - rod fluids obtained from computer simulation using the se method and from bulk simulations at many different densities has been reported in ref . , also for densities in the nematic phase .",
    "the authors of ref . explained this agreement by a very small interfacial width of the isotropic ",
    "nematic interface in comparison with the gravitational lengths considered in their work , a situation which is also realized in our simulations . however , for the model in ref .",
    "the density difference between isotropic and nematic phase is very small and any possible deviations between the bulk equation of state and the results from the se method simulations in the crossover density regime are not visible within the resolution and statistical uncertainty of the simulations .",
    "theoretically the effect of gravity on the phase behavior of hard rod solutions was studied in ref .. comparing density and order parameter profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig17]a with those calculated in ref .",
    "we can see a very good agreement : the density profiles show a quite small jump at the transition point and a smooth but significant decrease both in nematic and isotropic phases , while the orientational order parameter is almost constant within each of two phases and experiences a quite large jump at the transition point .",
    "monte carlo computer simulations using the bond fluctuation model have been performed for solutions of semiflexible chains of the length @xmath92 monomer units .",
    "three methods for pressure calculation in lattice monte carlo simulations have been investigated and compared : ( 1 ) the thermodynamic integration method in the grand canonical ensemble ( ti@xmath6 ) ; ( 2 ) the repulsive wall method in the grand canonical ensemble ( rwti ) ; ( 3 ) the sedimentation equilibrium method ( se ) in the canonical ensemble in an external sedimentation field .",
    "all three methods show quite similar results for solutions of flexible chains as well as for the region of the isotropic phase of semiflexible chains .",
    "however , differences may occur at higher densities ( or pressures ) where for semiflexible chains the transition to the nematic phase takes place .",
    "methodological problems of pressure measurement in solutions in the vicinity of isotropic - nematic transitions have been discussed .",
    "the most crucial point is that the presence of a hard repulsive wall and/or an external sedimentation field exerts a significant influence on the isotropic - nematic transition , both on the transition point ( transition density ) and also on the structure of the ordered phase .",
    "thus we have found that the se method is useful for obtaining the equation of state of various polymeric systems but its use becomes problematic in the vicinity of phase transitions .",
    "we have demonstrated this for the isotropic - nematic transition in solutions of semiflexible chains .",
    "the se method works quite well sufficiently below and above the density of the isotropic - nematic transition , but it fails to predict the transition density correctly , at least for system sizes ( which were reasonably large ) and sedimentation field strengths ( which were reasonably small ) used in our simulations .",
    "the source of the problems that we encountered is that for a system undergoing a transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase the se method implies that for densities large enough that the nematic phase can develop in the simulation box , one necessarily must have a transition zone of densities where the nematic ",
    "isotropic interface is present in the box .",
    "this nematic ",
    "isotropic interface is not sharp but rather extended , and hence it is not clear from data such as fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] to judge where the region of the  bulk  nematic phase stops and where the region of the interface begins .",
    "in fact , for an equilibrium interface in the absence of an external ( gravitational ) field we would have a smooth interfacial profile between the coexisting phases as well .",
    "this profile can be ( at least approximately ) considered as the convolution of an intrinsic profile with capillary  wave  induced broadening , which increases with the logarithm of the lateral system size , proportional to @xmath197 .",
    "note , that already in this case the problem of disentangling the interfacial profile from the capillary wave broadening is notoriously difficult .",
    "however , in the presence of a gravitational field the problem is even more subtle : while strong gravitational fields will lead to a  squeezing  of the intrinsic interface ( similar to the squeezing of interfaces by very strong confinement ) , and eliminate the capillary wave broadening completely , weak gravitational fields will leave the intrinsic profile more or less intact , but eliminate the long wavelength part of the capillary wave spectrum . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects a crossover from a broadening proportional to @xmath197 for not too large @xmath11 to a finite width independent of @xmath11 but controlled by the strength of the gravitational field .",
    "an explicit study of all these interfacial phenomena is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the problem gets even more complicated by the fact that also in the  bulk  nematic phase the nematic order parameter is not at all constant , but varies with the distance @xmath4 from the wall , since the order parameter near the transition depends strongly on density , and thus a strong variation of order parameter is caused by the density variation as well . in view of these problems , it is difficult from the se method to estimate accurately at which density the region of the isotropic phase stops and at which ( higher ) density then the region of the nematic phase begins .",
    "an estimation of the nematic order parameter at the transition point is hardly possible .",
    "a particularly subtle difficulty occurs if parameters such as system size @xmath69 in the long direction and strength of the gravitational potential are chosen such , that there is not enough space left for the nematic phase to develop , and the isotropic ",
    "nematic interface occurs directly adjacent to the wall ( fig .",
    "[ fig14]b ) .",
    "then data for the osmotic pressure in the transition region are obtained that are systematically too small , and suggest a transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase at a density that is clearly too low .",
    "this example shows that one must not rely on the se method blindly when a phase transition occurs , but one needs then to check that the results are not changing when the strength of the gravitational field and/or the size in the long direction are varied .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the chain length @xmath92 monomer units because in the bond - fluctuation model this chain length is sufficiently long to display gaussian behavior in its chain statistics in the melt ( i.e. , it is a real flexible polymer , not an oligomer ) and it is not too long to allow for a sufficiently efficient simulation .",
    "we should emphasize that the se method is valid for polymer chains of any length , provided the length scale of variation of the external potential in which the sedimentation equilibrium is reached is much larger than the radius of gyration of a polymer chain , e.g. , flexible chains of the length up to 500 monomer units have been studied in ref .. however , for the semiflexible chains the effect of chain stiffening in the nematic state@xcite will necessarily require much larger simulation boxes in comparison to the case of flexible chains of the same length .    while the ti@xmath6 method near the isotropic ",
    "nematic transition is hampered by hysteresis , fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , the fact that the transition in the @xmath198 plane must show up as a simple intersection point of the curves does allow an accurate location of the transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig16]a ) , and to characterize the magnitudes of the jumps . in this way , the strictly horizontal part in the @xmath147 vs. @xmath124 isotherm ( fig .",
    "[ fig16]b ) can be constructed .",
    "thus , we feel that for the accurate characterization of first order phase transitions the ti@xmath6 method is preferable , whenever applicable . with respect to the numerical data presented in this paper",
    ", we add the caveat that there may be still some systematic errors due to a too small value chosen for the lateral size @xmath11 .",
    "however , the same size was used for the simulations by means of se method , and hence we think that our discussion of the relative merits of these methods should not be affected by this problem .    in future work , we plan to extend these studies to include also attractive interaction between the monomer units , to investigate the competition between nematic ordering and polymer  solvent phase separation , applying the methods validated in the present paper .",
