    "one of the most interesting environmental effects is seen in interacting systems which contain stripped hi gas in the intragroup / intergalactic medium , instead of around galaxies .",

    "the fate of these types of objects and their importance in galaxy formation and evolution , enrichment of the intergalactic medium and globular cluster formation is still debatable . in order to better address these issues , we embarked on a multiwavelength analysis of the environment of interacting systems and present here the results based on fuv , nuv , optical , and hi data of a hickson compact group , hcg100 .",
    "the last group in hickson s catalog of compact groups of galaxies ( hickson 1982 ) is at v@xmath11 = 5336 km / s ( z=0.0178 , hickson et al .",
    "1992 ) and it is formed by four late - type galaxies with accordant redshifts : a bright central sb galaxy ( hcg100a ) , an irregular galaxy with an optical tidal tail ( hcg100b ) , a late - type barred spiral ( hcg100c ) with central h@xmath12 emission ( vilchez & iglesias - pramo 1998 ) and a late - type edge - on spiral ( hcg100d ) .",
    "hcg100a , b and c show strong evidence of interaction , demonstrated not only by peculiarities in their morphologies but also in their velocity fields ( plana et al .",
    "h100b shows a tidal tail connecting with a faint galaxy not originally classified as a member of the group by hickson .",
    "past encounters are also confirmed by an extended hi tail ( verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "therefore , the well - advanced dynamical state of hcg100 makes it an ideal target for searching for intergalactic hii regions that might have been triggered by tidal interaction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the data , ",
    "3 discusses the age , masses and star formation rate estimates ,  3.1 and  3.2 compare the intragroup regions in hcg100 with other intergalactic hii regions and high@xmath13 uv - luminous galaxies . finally , ",
    "4 summarizes the main conclusions . throughout this paper",
    ", we use a cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15  and @xmath16 .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab - system and the adopted distance to hcg100 is 76.3 mpc .",
    "hcg100 was observed with the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) mission in the far and near ultraviolet ( fuv @xmath17@xmath18=1528 , nuv @xmath17@xmath18=2271 ) as part of our cycle 1 program ( gi#73 ) to observe compact groups of galaxies . in fig .",

    "three 300s images of the group were taken , at a median seeing of 1.1@xmath20 .",
    "each frame covered a 40 arcmin field on a side , at a pixel scale of 0.27@xmath20/pixel , but we only used a 10 arcmin field around the object , given that this was the area of interest .",
    "the data was bias subtracted and flat fielded using standard procedures ( using the package mscred in iraf ) .",
    "a flatfield was constructed from a combination of dark sky frames and twilight flats which worked well , given that the background , after flatfielding was done , showed an rms variation no greater than 1% over the whole field .",
    "the night was not photometric and therefore no calibration stars were observed .",
    "instead , we chose to use two galaxies previously observed by rubin et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , hcg 100c and hcg 100d , for obtaining the zero point of the photometry ( see below ) .",

    "fluxes were multiplied by the effective filter bandpass ( @xmath27@xmath17@xmath23=269 and @xmath27@xmath17@xmath25=616 ) to give units of erg s@xmath5 @xmath10 and luminosities were calculated for a distance d=76.3 mpc .",
    "the r - band image was calibrated to match rubin et al .",
    "( 1991 ) magnitudes for galaxies hcg100c and hcg100d .",
    "total integrated r magnitudes of these objects are given in their table 3 ( no errors were quoted ) , and these were compared with the total instrumental magnitudes we obtained for these galaxies using two methods : ( 1 ) through aperture photometry in iraf ( using the task daophot.phot ) and ( 2 ) using the program sextractor ( bertin and arnouts et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the zero points obtained for each of these objects , and for each method , agreed within 0.1 mag , and we used an average of the values as our final zero point .",
    "the lack of a proper calibration , does not significantly change our results as shown in   3 .",
    "the hi data taken with the vla ( configuration d , pi verdes - montenegro ) is not able to resolve the intragroup objects since the beamwidth is 61.0@xmath20@xmath155.23@xmath20 ( 22.6",
    "kpc @xmath1 20.4  kpc at 76.3  mpc ) and objects have sizes @xmath216@xmath20 . therefore , our measurements of the hi fluxes were centered on the fuv detections but measured within one beam .",
    "fluxes were converted into mass by using the relation :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the distance to the group in mpc , @xmath30 is the hi flux in jy km / s .",
    "column densities were calculated by applying the following relation @xmath31    where @xmath32=beamwidth in arcmin@xmath33 , @xmath17 is the wavelength ( 21 cm ) and f is the hi flux density in jy / beam km / s ( rohlfs & wilson 2000 ) .",
    "we used sextractor ( se , bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to detect sources in the fuv and matched that catalog with the nuv and r - band catalogs .",
    "therefore , only objects with fuv detections were included in our final catalog . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on all objects which were detected in a region of 10@xmath0@xmath1 10@xmath0 centered on the hi tail ( verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we used se s kron elliptical apertures to measure magnitudes ( mag@xmath34auto ) in fuv , nuv and r - bands . although mag@xmath34auto is often used to measure total magnitudes in galaxy surveys ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2004 , de mello et al .",
    "2006 , zucca et al . 2006 ) , high uncertainties might be expected at the faint magnitudes due to the assumption that the sky background has gaussian random noise without source confusion ( brown et al .",
    "however , since we are comparing data taken with different resolutions and the fact that uv light does not necessarily peak at the same coordinate as the optical light , mag@xmath34auto performs better than the other sextractor choices , as long as a careful match between the different catalogs is performed .",
    "we matched the coordinates of the sources in the 3-bands within 1@xmath20 to 5@xmath20 and after visually checking each identification we chose 3@xmath20 as our best matched catalog with fuv , nuv and r - detections .",
    "the cross - match in the three bands resulted not only in the four most luminous members of hcg 100 ( table 1 ) but also 16 other objects , within the 10@xmath0@xmath110@xmath0 field ( table 2 ) .",
    "nine of these sources are within the hi tail : # 3 is the most distant object from the group ( 381 arcsec or 137.2 kpc from hcg100a ) and is located in the southern tip of the hi tail , # 4 is far from all of the brightest members of the group and located in the densest hi region , # 5 and # 6 are close to hcg100c , # 8 is isolated and 150 arcsec ( 53.9 kpc ) from hcg100a , # 9 is close to hcg100a , # 13 is a small galaxy not originally classified as a member of the hcg100 and located in the optical tidal tail of hcg100b , # 14 and # 15 are also close to the tidal tail .",
    "the other six objects have no hi detection but are still within the chosen field .",
    "se s magnitudes in fuv , nuv and r ( mag@xmath34auto ) were corrected for foreground galactic extinction using e(b - v)=0.081 and a@xmath35=e(b - v)@xmath12.634 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , a@xmath23=e(b - v)@xmath18.29 and a@xmath25=e(b - v)@xmath18.18 ( seibert et al . 2005 ) .    in table 3",
    "we list the hi mass per beam in the vicinity of nine of the intragroup objects detected , the other 7 objects are below the detection limit ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that , due to the low resolution of the data , the hi masses of the objects near large galaxies are contaminated by the hi masses of the latter . only objects # 3 , # 4 and # 8 are far away from bright members of the group and this contamination could be avoided .",
    "objects # 13 , # 14 , # 15 besides being close to h100b are within the same beam , therefore the hi masses listed in table 3 are not the individual masses of each object but the total mass within one beam centered in that region .",
    "as seen in fig.[fuvhi_10arcmin ] most of the intragroup objects are located in the outskirts of the hi contours where column densities range from 7.5 @xmath37 to 5@xmath38 @xmath10 , except for object # 4 which is located in a peak of hi where nhi is 1.2@xmath39 @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , hi clouds to which many of them are associated have column densities about one order of magnitude lower than the n(hi)@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 , value thought to be required for triggering star formation ( e.g. skillman et al .",
    "1988 ) . due to the low resolution of the hi data , all values are lower limits to the true hi column density .",

    "the sfr using fuv and nuv are similar except for objects # 6 and # 13 .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the latter object has double nuclei and is probably a merger of two small objects , whereas the former object is the largest object in the sample and probably a dwarf galaxy .",
    "therefore , the instantaneous star - formation law used to derive the sfr might not be suited to their stellar populations .",
    "if they have had several bursts of star - formation in the recent past , the fuv gives a more robust indicator of sfr than nuv since it is not contaminated by previous star formation .",

    "more recently , they have been identified in ongoing galaxy mergers where the fuv emission is seen to be associated with the hi tidal tails ( hibbard et al .",
    "2005 ) , extending large distances beyond the optical extent ( neff et al .",
    "one of our objects , # 4 , is similar to neff et al.s tdgs .",
    "it is located in the hi tail and where the hi column density peaks .",
    "it has an hi mass 10@xmath47 m@xmath4/beam in the vicinity and age 3.3  myr .",
    "what is interesting for this object and also object # 3 , is their location with respect to the group members ; object # 4 is 61 kpc away from hcg100a and object # 3 is at the very tip of the hi tail , 137 kpc away from hcg100a .",
    "the tdg - candidate found in hcg100 ( object # 4 ) described above and other tdgs found in other systems with hi tails are located far away from the group members and have young ages .",
    "for instance , the triplet formed by ngc7771 , ngc7770 and ngc7769 observed with galex has a 3  myr old tdg candidate within the 100  kpc hi tail ( neff et al 2005 ) .",
    "another compact group , hcg31 has a tdg 40 kpc away from the parent galaxy ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "2006 ) and is also located in a peak of hi in the gas tail .    the tidal material in interacting systems is expected to remain bound to the system .",
    "some of it will fall back onto the remnant and some will stay detached ( @xmath820% of ngc7252 tidal material will stay detached , according to hibbard & mihos 1995 ) for as long as a hubble time . according to verdes - montenegro et al.s ( 2005 ) proposed evolutionary scenario for compact groups , hcg100 is in phase 2 , when multiple tidal tails form and a large amount of atomic gas is found in the intragroup medium . in phase 3 of the evolutionary path , galaxies will lose hi gas and an hi deficient group will be produced ( sulentic et al .",
    "2001 , williams et al . 2002 ) . based on our results",
    "we suggest that at least a fraction of the tidal gas is used to form intragroup objects such as the ones within the hi tail .",
    "moreover , considering the distance between the star forming regions and the group members and the young ages of the stellar population , we are witnessing the in ",
    "situ \" star - formation within the hi tidal tail and can rule out the possibility of formation in the outskirts of the group galaxies and later ejection to the intragroup medium .    as shown in the r - band images ( fig.[all_obj ] ) , objects # 3 and # 4 resemble low surface brightness galaxies , whereas the others are either small round objects ( # 8 , # 9 , # 10 , and # 15 ) , but larger than the images psf , or have morphologies similar to objects found in the tail region of stephan s quintet ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that these objects are not related to the group and only with spectroscopy we will be able to tell whether they are group members or not .",
    "however , if found to be bound to hcg100 , as the intergalactic hii regions in stephan s quintet are , the intragroup medium of hcg100 is actively forming stars as far as 137 kpc away from the galaxies .",
    "the sfrs are modest , 0.0010.02  m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 , but similar to ihii regions found by ryan - weber et al . ( 2004 ) at distances up to 33 kpc from ngc  1533 and by sakai et al .",
    "( 2002 ) at distances of 155 kpc in the a1367 cluster .",
    "the stellar masses of our sources ( table 3 ) range between 10@xmath610@xmath7 m@xmath4 .",
    "the large spread in masses can be interpreted as a sign of evolution or different population of objects . in the first scenario ,",
    "some of the objects are still in the process of formation and have not converted all the gas supply into stars as duc & mirabel ( 1997 ) suggested for tdgs . in the second scenario , we are detecting two populations of objects : tdgs and ihii regions . the low  mass objects are the ihii regions and high  mass objects are tdgs .",
    "one caveat to keep in mind is the fact that the stellar masses can be higher than what we obtained , since the intrinsic extinction for some objects is probably higher than the milky way value used to estimate their age .",
    "higher extinction correction would make them more uv luminous and therefore more massive .",
    "since the intragroup objects were uv - selected , we have compared them with a class of objects which is also selected by their uv emission but are at high redshifts , the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs , steidel et al .",
    "lbgs are star - forming galaxies at @xmath48 , they are relatively small ( r@xmath49=1 - 3 kpc ) , have relatively low mass ( 10@xmath50m@xmath51 ) and low extinction .",
    "lbgs are thought to be the building blocks of larger systems proposed by the hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy formation and evolution ( kauffmann et al .",
    "the fate of intragroup objects might be similar , since at least some are likely to be accreted by the larger galaxies in the group .",
    "hcg100a , for instance , may have already suffered a major accretion event , given its very peculiar velocity field ( plana et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "recently , hoopes et al .",
    "( 2007 ) identified a sample of the local equivalents of lbgs using images from the uv satellite galex and spectroscopy from the sdss . among the uv - luminous galaxy ( uvlgs ) population",
    ", they found a subset of supercompact galaxies that are similar to lbgs .",
    "as shown in table 4 , the intragroup objects in hcg100 are not as uv - luminous as uvlgs and lbgs and also form stars in a much lower rate than those .",
    "this might be an evolutionary effect suggesting that objects in the intragroup medium are less efficient in forming stars than lbgs and uvlgs .",
    "we have analyzed the uv and optical light in combination with the hi gas within the compact group of galaxies hcg100 and identified 16 star - forming regions in the intragroup region .",
    "the young age ( @xmath52  myr ) of these objects and the proximity to the tidal tail connects the ob stars formation time scale ( @xmath810@xmath53 yr ) with the dynamic time scale of the tidal features . moreover , the hi clouds to which many of them are associated have column densities about one order of magnitude lower than the n(hi)@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 thought to be required for triggering star formation .",
    "so , in these cases , we have a strong indication that the hi clouds must have suffered recent collisions which could have then triggered the star formation process .",
    "based on their ages , stellar masses and hi masses in their vicinities , we conclude that some of these objects are tidal dwarf galaxies with ongoing star formation and some are intergalactic hii regions or conglomeration of stellar clusters .",
    "although we have an estimate of the amount of neutral gas in these objects , the main ingredient in the star - formation process , the molecular gas , is unknown for these objects . from co observations of tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) ,",
    "braine et al . ( 2001 ) provided strong evidence that tdgs are self - gravitating entities with large amounts of atomic gas which will transform into molecular gas and subsequently form stars .",
    "co observations together with spectroscopy of these objects will be of great value in understanding their nature . for instance",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility that some of these objects are not associated with hcg100 , but at least those falling within hi density peaks are likely to be associated with the group .",
    "moreover , we will be able to estimate metallicity of these newly formed regions and evaluate the enrichment level of the processed gas in the intragroup medium .",
