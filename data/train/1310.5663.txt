    "inventory management is of great economic importance to industry , but forecasting demand for spare parts is difficult because it is _ intermittent _ : in many time periods the demand is zero .",
    "this type of demand occurs in several industries , for example in aerospace and military inventories from which spare parts such as wings or jet engines are infrequently required .",
    "various methods have been proposed for forecasting , some simple and others statistically sophisticated , but relatively little work has been done on intermittent demand .",
    "most work in this area is influenced by that of @xcite , who first separated the forecasting of demand size and inter - demand interval .",
    "a survey of forecasting methods for spare parts is given in @xcite .    to choose a good forecasting method we can test the alternatives empirically on demand series to see which gives the smallest error .",
    "for this we require an _ error measure _ ( or _ accuracy measure _ ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no general agreement on which of the many existing error measures is best .",
    "forecasting methods have been extensively compared on real and simulated data in the well - known m- , m2- and m3-competitions @xcite using several error measures .",
    "however , these forecasting competitions did not deal specifically with intermittent demands , so the experience gained from these competitions can not be used as a guide .    for intermittent demand series",
    "some error measures are inapplicable because division by zero leads to infinities , but there are still several possibilities .",
    "this is an important issue because if researchers are free to choose from a large set of measures then their results are likely to be incomparable .",
    "moreover , there is a temptation to choose measures that give desired results @xcite , making experiments less objective . in 1992 the editor of the international journal of forecasting",
    "wrote that the choice of error measure _ is not a matter of personal preference _ and urged researchers to follow contemporary recommendations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the suitability of known error measures for intermittent demand , and propose new improved measures .",
    "section [ background ] provides background , demonstrates anomalous behaviour in existing error measures , and proposes new measures .",
    "section [ experiments ] evaluates the new measures on simulated data .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we provide some necessary background and describe our contribution .",
    "section [ methods ] describes the relevant forecasting methods , section [ measures ] surveys known error measures , section [ ranking ] argues that these measures can rank forecasters incorrectly , and section [ newmeasures ] proposes new measures .",
    "first we describe the forecasting methods that will be used in the paper . _ single exponential smoothing _ ( ses ) computes a smoothed series @xmath0 via the formula @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a _",
    "smoothing parameter_. the smaller the value of @xmath3 the less weight is attached to the most recent observations .",
    "an up - to - date survey of exponential smoothing algorithms is given in @xcite .",
    "they perform remarkably well , often beating more complex approaches @xcite .",
    "however , ses is known to perform poorly on intermittent demand , at least under some error measures .",
    "the standard method for handling intermittency is _",
    "croston s method _",
    "@xcite which applies ses to the non - zero demand sizes @xmath4 and inter - demand intervals @xmath5 independently , using smoothing factors @xmath3 and @xmath6 respectively . given",
    "smoothed demand @xmath0 and smoothed interval @xmath7 at time @xmath8 , the forecast is @xmath9 . both @xmath0 and @xmath7 , and hence @xmath10 ,",
    "are updated at each time @xmath8 for which @xmath11 .",
    "alternative versions were proposed by @xcite and we shall use the variant of syntetos & boylan @xcite which is known to have low bias and variance on stochastic demand .",
    "we also mention the _ random walk _",
    "method ( rw ) , also known as the _ naive method _ : take the previous period s demand as a forecast . though rw is a rather trivial forecaster , it is often used as a baseline for evaluating other methods .",
    "finally we mention the forecaster that always forecasts 0 , which following @xcite we call zf .",
    "it was proposed by croston , mentioned by @xcite and studied by @xcite .",
    "next we survey error measures , largely based on @xcite .",
    "no one error measure is generally accepted as useful on intermittent demand , and opinion is highly divided @xcite .",
    "a common compromise is to use more than one measure as in the forecasting competitions , and @xcite recommend using different measures for different types of demand .",
    "the most common are :    * mean [ signed ] error ( me ) : mean(@xmath12 ) * mean square error ( mse ) : mean(@xmath13 ) * root mean square error ( rmse ) : @xmath14 * mean absolute error ( mae ) : mean(@xmath15 ) * median absolute error ( mdae ) : median(@xmath15 )    where @xmath12 is the error @xmath16 .",
    "these are useful for comparing methods on one series , but not for comparing over several series .",
    "doubt has been cast on the suitability of mae for intermittent demand @xcite .",
    "these are also popular :    * mean absolute percentage error ( mape ) : mean(@xmath17 ) * median absolute percentage error ( mdape ) : median(@xmath17 ) * root mean square percentage error ( rmspe ) : @xmath18 * root median square percentage error ( rmdspe ) : @xmath19 * symmetric mean absolute percentage error ( smape ) : @xmath20 * symmetric median absolute percentage error ( smdape ) : @xmath21    where @xmath22 .",
    "the last two measures are motivated by the fact that mape and mdape penalise positive errors more than negative ones .    however , percentage errors are undefined if any @xmath23 ( and if @xmath24 in the last two cases ) and have very skewed distributions when @xmath25 .",
    "it is also pointed out in @xcite that they assume a meaningful zero , which is not the case for some data such as temperatures . despite these drawbacks mape",
    "is recommended by most textbooks and was the main error measure used in the m - competition , while mdape is recommended by @xcite , and smape and smdape were used in the m3-competition .",
    "it is pointed out by @xcite that many commercial software packages report a mape even when a series contains zeros , although the mape is technically undefined in this case .",
    "this is done by simply excluding periods with zero demands , which does not reflect the true errors of a forecast .",
    "we shall denote this mape variant by imape .",
    "we may also scale by using errors from other measures :    * mean relative absolute error ( mrae ) : mean(@xmath26 ) * median relative absolute error ( mdrae ) : median(@xmath26 ) * geometric mean relative absolute error ( gmrae ) : gmean(@xmath26 )    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the error from a baseline method which is often rw .",
    "gmrae is also known as relative geometric root mean square and has desirable statistical properties @xcite .",
    "it is used by @xcite , and @xcite recommends the use of relative error - based measures .",
    "it has been proposed for intermittent demand in particular @xcite . however , these measures have the drawback of infinite variance because @xmath28 can be arbitrarily small @xcite . in the particular case of intermittent demand with rw as baseline",
    ", @xmath28 is often zero so these measures are undefined .",
    "extreme values can be trimmed @xcite but this introduces some arbitrariness @xcite .      instead of computing an absolute quantity to measure the accuracy of a method",
    ", we may compare it with another method .",
    "this can be done for many types of error measure , for example    * relative mean absolute error ( relmae ) : mae / mae@xmath29 * relative mean squared error ( relmse ) : mse / mse@xmath29 * relative root mean squared error ( relrmse ) : rmse / rmse@xmath29 * etc    where mae@xmath29 , mse@xmath29 and rmse@xmath29 are the mae , mse and rmse of a baseline measure .",
    "the most popular baseline is rw , in which case relrmse is theil s u2 statistic @xcite and @xmath30 is thompson s lmr measure @xcite .",
    "relmae was recommended for intermittent demand by @xcite and called cummae by @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely for these measures to become infinite , because the denominator is only zero if the baseline forecaster gives perfect results .",
    "another relative measure is percent better ( pb ) where a method is compared to another , usually rw , by how often its absolute error is smaller .",
    "this is recommended by @xcite .",
    "a related measure is percent best ( pbt ) which compares several methods and computes the percentage of times each is most accurate .",
    "a drawback with pb and pbt is that they give no indication of the size of errors , so one large error is considered to be less serious than two tiny errors .",
    "we mention two of these .",
    "firstly , the mad / mean ratio @xcite , also called the weighted mape , which we shall abbreviate to mmr .",
    "mad ( mean absolute deviation ) is another name for mae so @xmath31 .",
    "secondly , the mase @xcite ( mean absolute scaled error ) defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a scaled error defined by @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the set of sample periods used for forecasting .",
    "mase effectively evaluates a forecasting method against rw .",
    "the only situation in which it is unusable is when all in - sample demands are identical .",
    "other scaled error measures defined analogously to mase include the root mean squared scaled error ( rmsse ) and the median absolute scaled error ( mdase ) .",
    "mase has been argued to be superior to several other methods used in forecasting competitions .",
    "an advantage of mase over mmr is that it is more reliable on demand with seasonality , trends or other forms of non - stationarity .",
    "however , @xcite note that the mase of two series with identical forecasts and identical demands during the forecast horizon will differ if the two series differed in their historical demands .",
    "this is counter - intuitive so mase is not always easy to interpret .",
    "which forecaster is best for intermittent demand ?",
    "there is no universally - agreed ranking but cr is often applied in practice to intermittent demand @xcite , and versions of cr are used in leading statistical forecasting software packages such as sap and forecast pro @xcite so we might expect it to be ranked first . however , there is some debate on this issue .",
    "@xcite investigate whether mape , mse or u2 is the best error measure for intermittent demand , using more than one error measure . they find that zf does surprisingly well , beating ses and cr on lumpy demand under a modified mape , but losing under mse and u2 .",
    "however , @xcite note that zf is of no practical use for inventory control .",
    "@xcite found that ses beat cr on intermittent demand , using more than one error measure , though cr was better if issue point only were considered .",
    "according to @xcite it is hard to conclude from the various studies that cr is best , because the results depend on the data and error measures used .",
    "@xcite also note that there is no conclusive evidence pointing to a best method .",
    "but @xcite conclude that the apparently poor performance of cr in some studies is caused by the use of inappropriate error measures , while @xcite found that cr beats ses on intermittent series .",
    "our position is that it is both reasonable and consistent with current wisdom to rank cr above ses , and ses above zf , on intermittent demand series .",
    "cr has maintained its popularity over several decades , and if practitioners prefer a method based on experience , then any error measure that disagrees with this preference is of little use to them .",
    "we shall therefore take it as axiomatic that any error measure that fails this test , which we denote by cr @xmath36 ses @xmath36 zf , should not be applied to intermittent demand .",
    "of course some researchers will disagree with this position , which is entirely reasonable , but we hope that our work will be of use to those who agree with our ranking axiom .      in section [ experiments ]",
    "we shall test known error measures against this axiom .",
    "first we propose several new measures : in fact one for each existing measure , obtained by evaluating forecasts against the _ mean of the underlying stochastic process _ of the demand , which we denote @xmath37 , instead of the point demand @xmath38 .",
    "so instead of the usual error @xmath39 we use @xmath40 , instead of @xmath22 we use @xmath41 , and similarly for baseline measures .",
    "the error @xmath42 measures how well a forecaster ignores noise and estimates the underlying demand rate .",
    "we shall call these _ mean - based _ measures , and denote them by adding the prefix `` m '' to the measure they are based on ( mmae , mmse , etc ) .    for artificial data",
    "it is easy to find @xmath37 . for stationary demand",
    "we can use @xmath43 where the mean is either derived analytically or simply computed over the entire series . for non - stationary demand the mean of the stochastic process",
    "is a function of time , but we can still use our knowledge of the data to obtain the dynamic underlying demand rate .",
    "for example the obsolescence experiments of @xcite use artificial data whose non - zero demand probability drops either linearly or abruptly to 0 , whereas demand sizes follow a fixed distribution : in either case we can multiply the current probability by the fixed distribution mean to obtain @xmath37 .    on real - world series",
    "the stochastic process is of course unknown , though one can make assume a particular form ( for example a poisson process ) then estimate its parameters .",
    "a simple approach is to estimate the current mean demand via standard techniques used to estimate seasonal components .",
    "it is common to estimate a seasonal component by taking a moving average over a window , stretching forward and backward in time .",
    "we can use the same moving window technique to obtain a smoothed version of the demand series , and use this as @xmath37 .",
    "if the demand series is too short to use a moving window , we can estimate the changing mean by regression . or if we assume demand to be stationary , we can take the series mean as @xmath37 . as with seasonal component estimation",
    ", there are several reasonable approaches .",
    "mean - based error measures have wider applicability than their original counterparts .",
    "percentage errors such as mape are undefined whenever @xmath23 , whereas mmape is only undefined when @xmath44 : for stationary demand @xmath37 is the series mean , which is only zero when @xmath23 for all @xmath8 .",
    "relative error - based measures such as gmrae with rw as baseline are undefined on intermittent demand , because both the demand and rw s forecast are often zero so the rw error @xmath45 ( which is the denominator ) is also zero .",
    "however , a measure such as mgmrae is only undefined when the denominator @xmath46 is zero : the rw forecast @xmath47 will often be zero , but again @xmath48 is only zero when @xmath23 for all @xmath8 .",
    "we now have a large number of new error measures , none of which is likely to give infinite answers on intermittent demand .",
    "this allows us to measure forecasting deviations using absolute or squared values , in scaled or unscaled ways , and on one or multiple demand series . in the next section",
    "we shall evaluate them with respect to our forecaster ranking axiom .",
    "the error measures we compare are selected from the various classes described in section [ measures ] . to represent the scale - dependent measures we use mae , mdae and mse and their mean - based equivalents mmae , mmdae and mmse ; from the percentage errors we use imape and mmape .",
    "note that the mmape of zf is always @xmath49 and the imape of zf is always @xmath50 ( mape is undefined on intermittent demand ) . to represent the relative error - based measures we use only mgmrae with rw as baseline ( gmrae with rw as baseline is undefined for intermittent demand ) . to represent the relative measures we use pb and mpb with rw as baseline .",
    "we start with data based on that used in the experiments of teunter _",
    "demands occur with some probability in each period , hence inter - demand intervals are distributed geometrically , and we use a logarithmic distribution for demand sizes .",
    "geometrically distributed intervals are a discrete version of poisson intervals , and the combination of poisson intervals and logarithmic demand sizes yields a negative binomial distribution , for which there is theoretical and empirical evidence : see for example the recent discussion in @xcite .",
    "_ generate demand data that is nonzero with probability @xmath51 where @xmath51 is either 0.2 or 0.5 , and whose size is logarithmically distributed .",
    "the logarithmic distribution is characterised by a parameter @xmath52 and is discrete with @xmath53= - \\ell^k / k \\log(1- \\ell)$ ] for @xmath54 .",
    "they use two values : @xmath55 to simulate low demand and @xmath56 to simulate lumpy demand .",
    "tables [ results1][results4 ] show best results for ses , cr and zf using @xmath3 and @xmath6 values chosen from @xmath57 .",
    "we initialise the forecasters by choosing arbitrary initial values @xmath58 then running them for @xmath59 periods using demand probability @xmath51 .",
    "results are then computed over @xmath60 time periods . to estimate the stochastic process mean we simply compute the mean of all @xmath60 demands ( including zeros ) .",
    "the results show that mae , mdae and imape are unreliable error measures for some types of intermittent demand because they incorrectly rank the three forecasters .",
    "pb is more reliable but the differences are sometimes very small , and in one case pb ranked cr and ses equally . among existing measures",
    "only mse behaves correctly .",
    "however , all mean - based measures behave correctly , though mpb still scores cr and ses quite similarly .",
    "we also tried geometrically distributed demand sizes as in @xcite , and regular intermittent demand as in @xcite , with similar results .",
    ".results for artificial demand with @xmath61 and @xmath55 [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , < , < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     collectively these results imply that almost all tested error measures are unreliable .",
    "they also imply that other untested error measures are unreliable , because they are monotonic functions of mae or mse and hence rank forecasters in the same way .",
    "these include rmse , relative measures such as relmae and relmse and as their special cases u2 and lmr , and scaled errors such as mmr and mase . hence most existing error measures are inapplicable to intermittent demand , if our ranking axiom is reasonable .",
    "pb was almost correct , but in one case it was unable to distinguish between cr and ses ( see table [ results1 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that all known error measures ( except me which measures bias , not deviation ) are unreliable on some types of intermittent demand , even when they do not incur infinities , so there is currently no reliable way of measuring deviation .",
    "these results reinforce and complement those of @xcite , who show that mae and rmse rank zf above ses ( and above a moving average ) , and ses above cr , on a large data set of intermittent demand from an air force .",
    "our results apply to more error measures and are more easily reproducible , being based on simple artificial data .",
    "but their result shows that the inappropriateness of at least some current error measures extends to real data .",
    "in contrast , our new measures gave correct results in all cases .",
    "based on our experiments , and on inapplicabilities pointed out by other researchers , we make two proposals regarding measures of deviation for intermittent demand .",
    "firstly , we do not recommend _ any _ existing error measures .",
    "secondly , we recommend several new error measures : mmse , mrmse , mmae , mmdae , mmape , mrelmse ( including special cases mu2 and mlmr plus other relative measures such as mrelmae ) , mrelrmse , mmmr , mmase and mgmrae . which of these is best depends on user preference , and considerations such as whether errors are to be compared on one or across several series .    in our experiments",
    "we did not evaluate several other possible new measures : mmdape , mrmspe , mrmdspe , msmape , msmdape , mmrae , mmdrae , mrmsse and mmdase , all defined in the obvious way .",
    "we leave their evaluation for future work .",
    "we have shown that almost all known error measures rank forecasting methods incorrectly on some intermittent demand series . given this result , and the well - known fact that several error measures are inapplicable to intermittent demand because of infinities , there is currently no reliable way of measuring forecast deviation errors on such demands .    to alleviate this problem , we described a simple way of modifying all known error measures so that they are more widely applicable and behave more correctly .",
    "this yields many new _ mean - based _",
    "error measures that can be used to compare forecasters on intermittent demand .",
    "they are unlikely to be plagued by infinities , and in tests they consistently ranked forecasters correctly .",
    "we have defined a large number of new error measures , and it might be argued that this only adds to the confusion .",
    "but we believe that the improved behaviour and wider applicability of our measures make them worth considering when faced with intermittent demand . to simplify matters",
    "we should perhaps recommend a small number of new measures . based on popularity and the recommendations of experts",
    ", we choose the mean - based analogues of mape , gmrae and u2 .",
    "in future work we shall evaluate other error measures that can be modified by our technique .",
    "we shall experiment with artificial non - stationary data and real - world series .",
    "the statistical properties of the new error measures should be investigated .",
    "finally , the new error measures can also be applied to non - intermittent demand , and we shall evaluate their usefulness using series from the forecasting competitions .",
