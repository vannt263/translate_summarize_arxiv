    "the discovery of heavy fermion metals , metal - insulator transitions in transition metal oxides , high - temperature superconductivity in copper oxides , and colossal magnetoresistance in manganates has stimulated extensive theoretical studies of strongly correlated electron models.@xcite in spite of intensive research over the past decade the nature of the metallic state in strongly correlated materials is still poorly understood .",
    "this is particularly true of the cuprate superconductors , for which most of the metallic properties can not be understood within the fermi liquid picture that has so successfully described conventional metals.@xcite yet there are also a wide range of materials which have low - temperature properties ( e.g. , the observation of magnetic oscillations such as the de haas - van alphen effect ) consistent with a fermi liquid but which at higher temperature are inconsistent with a fermi liquid .",
    "these include transition metal oxides,@xcite heavy fermions,@xcite strontium ruthenates,@xcite the quasi - two - dimensional molecular crystals @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3x ( ref . ) and the quasi - one - dimensional bechgaard salts@xcite ( tmtsf)@xmath4x . in conventional metals the electronic properties are robust up to temperatures of some sizable fraction of the fermi energy . in contrast , in the above materials the electronic properties change at some temperature much less than the fermi energy .",
    "a brief summary is now given of some of the common differences between the transport properties of strongly correlated metals and the properties of elemental metals .",
    "later in the paper specific references will be given to experimental results on a wide range of materials .",
    "_ resistivity .",
    "_ boltzmann transport theory gives an expression for the magnitude of the resistivity in terms of band parameters and a mean - free path between quasi - particle collisions . at low temperatures",
    "this expression suggests a mean - free path which is much larger than a lattice constant , as in conventional metals .",
    "however , at higher temperatures the resistivity smoothly increases to large values that suggest a mean - free path which is smaller than a lattice constant , implying the breakdown of a quasi - particle picture .",
    "_ thermopower .",
    "_ in conventional metals this is linear in temperature , has values much less than @xmath5 v / k , and has the same sign as the charge carriers . in strongly correlated metals",
    "it can have a non - monotonic temperature dependence , can change sign , and have values of the order @xmath6 .    _ hall resistance .",
    "_ in conventional metals this is weakly temperature dependent and gives the sign of the charge carriers . in strongly correlated metals",
    ", the hall resistance can be strongly temperature dependent , change sign , and have the opposite sign to the thermopower .",
    "_ optical conductivity .",
    "_ in conventional metals , one observes a drude peak at zero frequency , which broadens but persists to high temperatures .",
    "the spectral weight of this peak is comparable to that predicted from the optical sum rule and the density of charge carriers ( or the plasma frequency ) . in contrast , in strongly correlated metals most of the spectral weight is in broad features at high energies .",
    "furthermore , the drude peak only exists at low temperatures .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that transport properties such as those described above are obtained in a dynamical mean - field treatment of the hubbard model . over the past decade",
    "a considerable amount of work has been done using this approximation to understand the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition.@xcite this approximation becomes exact in the limit of either large lattice connectivity or spatial dimensionality .",
    "it has been found to give a good description of three - dimensional transition metal oxides and has been argued to be relevant to the properties of the cuprates.@xcite whereas most previous studies of transport properties @xcite have focussed on doped mott insulators we consider the case where the band is half filled and the hubbard interaction @xmath7 is less than the minimum value needed for the formation of the mott insulating state .",
    "this is the situation in the metallic phase of the molecular crystals @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3x ( ref . ) .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory maps the hubbard model onto a single impurity anderson model that must be solved self - consistently .",
    "while time - dependent fluctuations are captured by this approximation , spatially - dependent fluctuations are neglected . some important physics",
    "that emerges@xcite is that there is a low - energy scale @xmath8 which is much smaller than the non - interacting half - bandwidth @xmath9 and the coulomb repulsion @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath9 is of the order of the fermi energy given by band structure calculations .",
    "this energy scale @xmath8 is the analogue of the kondo temperature for the impurity problem and defines the energy scale of coherent spin excitations . in the metallic phase the density of states",
    "@xmath10 contains peaks at energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 which correspond to the lower and upper hubbard bands , respectively , and involve incoherent charge excitations .",
    "these peaks are broad and have width of order @xmath9 . at temperatures less than @xmath8 a quasi - particle peak with width of order @xmath8 forms at the fermi energy ( see fig .",
    "[ spectu4t203 ] ) .",
    "the quasi - particle band involves coherent excitations ( i.e. , they have a well - defined dispersion relation ) that form a fermi liquid . the spectral weight of this peak ( see fig .",
    "2 ) vanishes as the metal - insulator transition is approached .",
    "thus , the temperature @xmath8 defines an energy scale at which there is a crossover from fermi liquid behavior to incoherent excitations . a similar crossover occurs in heavy fermion materials.@xcite      in section [ model ]",
    "the model we study is introduced : a hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice with one electron per site ( i.e. , at half - filling ) . as well as a nearest - neighbour hopping @xmath13 a next - nearest - neighbour hopping @xmath14 is also included for several reasons .",
    "first , this term introduces magnetic frustration which enhances the stability of the metallic phase by suppressing the neel temperature for antiferromagnetic ordering.@xcite second , in the absence of this term the model has exact particle - hole symmetry and the thermopower and hall conductivity vanish .",
    "third , the model represents a higher - dimensional version of a frustrated hubbard model that describes the organic conductors @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3x ( ref . ) . in section [ lisa ]",
    "we review how the dynamical mean - field theory reduces to an impurity problem . in the infinite - dimensional limit",
    "all the vertex corrections to correlation functions vanish and transport quantities are determined by the one - electron spectral function .",
    "the relevant expressions are presented in section [ trans ] .",
    "section [ ipt ] describes how the local impurity problem is solved at the level of iterated perturbation theory .",
    "this method is known to give reliable results for the impurity problem up to moderate interactions .    at low temperatures and low energies",
    "the electron self energy has a fermi liquid form and in section [ fl ] we present analytical results for the different transport quantities in this regime .",
    "an expression is derived for the kadowaki - woods ratio : the ratio of the @xmath15 coefficient of the resistivity to the square of the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath16 . for strong interactions",
    "it is shown to be independent of the band parameters and the strength of the interactions .",
    "the ratio of the thermopower to @xmath17 is shown to be independent of the strength of the interactions .",
    "the temperature dependence of the different transport quantities is presented in section [ incoh ] . in",
    "particular we focus on the effect of the crossover from coherent to incoherent excitations with increasing temperature . for moderate to strong interactions the resistivity smoothly increases from a @xmath15 dependence at low temperatures to large values corresponding to mean - free paths less than a lattice constant . for strong interactions",
    "the resistivity can have a non - monotonic temperature dependence ; at temperatures several times the coherence temperature it decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "the thermopower is linear in temperature up to a temperature of the order of the coherence temperature at which it decreases .",
    "the resulting peak is similar to the peak which occurs in the electronic specific heat and is associated with the thermal destruction of the quasi - particles . for strong interactions most of the spectral weight in the optical conductivity",
    "is associated with transitions from ( to ) the lower ( upper ) hubbard band .",
    "a drude peak only exists for temperatures less than the coherence temperature .",
    "we consider a hubbard model with nearest neighbours hopping , @xmath13 , and next - nearest neighbours hopping , @xmath14 , on a given lattice . the hamiltonian is @xmath18 where @xmath7 is the coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the same site and @xmath19 is the chemical potential .",
    "we will only consider the case of half - filling , i.e. , one electron per site .",
    "we treat the case of a @xmath20-dimensional hypercubic lattice with connectivity @xmath21 , which has a @xmath13 hopping to any of the @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) neighbours and @xmath14 along the diagonals of the elementary unit cell . in order to have a finite kinetic energy in the @xmath24 limit the hoppings",
    "are rescaled as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with @xmath23 , @xmath21 being the connectivity of the lattice .",
    "the non - interacting ( @xmath27 ) density of states , @xmath28 , associated with this lattice in the limit of infinite dimensions @xmath29 reads @xcite : @xmath30 with @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "@xmath32 , whenever @xmath33 is not real . note that @xmath34 has a finite band - edge with a square - root divergence .",
    "we set @xmath35 as the unit of energy .",
    "the reason for choosing this lattice is that we can treat a varying degree of frustration by tuning the ratio @xmath36 , which changes the shape of the bare density of states .",
    "other lattices , such as the bethe lattice with next - nearest neighbours can also be used , but its density of states remains symmetric and therefore is qualitatively the same as its non - frustrated counterpart .      in the limit of infinite dimensions ,",
    "mean - field theory of the full interacting lattice problem becomes exact and the problem reduces to solving a set of dynamical mean - field equations.@xcite therefore , the original hubbard model is mapped to an impurity problem in the presence of a bath of electrons which describes the rest of the lattice electrons and that has to be found self - consistently . more precisely , one has to solve the associated single - impurity anderson model : @xmath37 where the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 describe the bath of electrons through the hybridization function , which is defined as @xmath40 this function represents the amplitudes for the lattice electrons to leave a site and , after wandering around the lattice , to return .",
    "therefore the problem remains local in space coordinates but time - dependent correlations are fully taken into account .",
    "this is because in the large coordination limit , an electron can only hop once from one site to its nearest neighbour .",
    "processes , in which an electron can repeat a given path from one site to another in the lattice are suppressed as they are at least of order @xmath41 .",
    "some preliminary work is just appearing @xcite , which tries to extend the zero - order expansion to include these type of higher - order processes .    the bath function @xmath42 is determined self - consistently , from the following condition : @xmath43 where the self - energy @xmath44 is determined by solving the anderson hamiltonian ( [ handerson ] ) , which is local in space , _",
    "i.e _ , does not depend on momentum .",
    "@xmath45 is the lattice green s function from which the spectral densities can be obtained @xmath46      in the limit of infinite dimensions , transport quantities can be calculated straightforwardly , due to the local nature of the self - energy .",
    "for example , the evaluation of the optical conductivity simplifies drastically as only the particle - hole bubble has to be evaluated in the kubo formula .",
    "contributions due to higher order processes included in vertex corrections cancel exactly@xcite . for a more detailed discussion of the derivation of the expressions presented here see references and .",
    "several transport quantities of interest can be obtained from the spectral density .",
    "the real part of the optical conductivity in the x - direction is given by @xmath47 where @xmath1 is the lattice constant , @xmath48 and @xmath49 the total number of sites in the system .",
    "the hall conductivity is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an external magnetic field that points in the @xmath21 direction and @xmath52 .",
    "we can also compute the hall coefficient , @xmath53 .",
    "the thermopower is defined as @xmath54 where the transport integrals reduce in the @xmath55 limit to : @xmath56^j \\omega^{k-1}. \\label{transp}\\ ] ]    in the above expressions , a further simplification can be done in the case of a simple hypercubic lattice , as all sums in momentum reduce to integrations in energy weighed by the density of states . @xmath57 with the spectral densities given by @xmath58 we will use this simplification in order to avoid the cumbersome sums over momentum . in particular the dc conductivity reduces to the following expression @xmath59 for the simple hypercubic lattice .    for reasons of simplicity , we will still use the above expressions in the presence of a non - zero @xmath60 .",
    "this is because the focus of this paper is on many - body effects and not how different band structures may change the results slightly .      a wide range of techniques",
    "have been used to solve the anderson model ( [ handerson ] ) .",
    "an extensive review has been given by hewson @xcite . among them the iterative perturbation theory ( ipt ) is straightforward and at the same time gives a qualitatively correct description because it recovers exactly the atomic ( @xmath61 ) and the non - interacting ( @xmath27 ) limits .",
    "it also provides a fast way for scanning a wide range of parameters in the anderson model , which , by means of other methods such as exact diagonalization and quantum - monte carlo are computationally very demanding .",
    "other approximate schemes such as the non - crossing approximation , which takes an infinite resummation of a certain class of perturbative diagrams , is limited in its applicability to high temperatures @xcite .",
    "originally , the iterative perturbation scheme could only be applied for systems at half - filling and with particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this limitation comes from the fact that the high energy behaviour of the spectral density is exactly reproduced for half - filling by accident but this is not true at arbitrary filling .",
    "however , our main interest in this work is to study frustrated models where the non - interacting density of states is non - symmetric and , consequently , particle - hole symmetry is broken .",
    "recently kajueter and kotliar@xcite have modified the standard iterative perturbation theory to asymmetric cases , based on the earlier work of martin - rodero _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "other authors@xcite , have extended this framework to compute more accurately the high - energy features of the spectral densities .",
    "nevertheless , all of them approximately agree with exact diagonalization calculations when the interaction , @xmath7 , is relatively large .",
    "our present work analyzes the transport properties of metals which are strongly correlated but sufficiently away from the mott transition so that well - defined quasiparticles exist at low temperatures .",
    "this means that we are always in the metallic side of the mott transition but not too close to the critical point at which the quasiparticle weight vanishes .",
    "some controversy has arised recently on the reliability of ipt even for moderate couplings of the interaction .",
    "very recently , fischer @xcite pointed out that a second - order expansion in terms of the skeleton diagrams which depend on the interacting green s function , @xmath45 instead of @xmath62 , does not reproduce the upper and lower hubbard bands : only a fermi liquid type peak is found in the spectral density@xcite .",
    "the skeleton diagrams enter the expansion of the luttinger - ward functional and are the ones that collapse into a local form in the @xmath55 , giving a local self - energy @xcite .",
    "however , yamada @xcite has shown that when taking into account all the 4th order terms , the upper and lower hubbard bands are reproduced , in agreement with the ipt results .",
    "this means that an expansion up to second - order in the interacting green s functions is insufficient to grasp the correct behaviour of the spectral density .",
    "moreover , recent non - perturbative calculations done by bulla , hewson , and pruschke,@xcite using the numerical renormalization group for the hubbard model in infinite dimensions , clearly shows the formation of the upper and lower hubbard bands .",
    "therefore , we believe that the method used here can be safely applied giving a qualitative description of strongly correlated metals .",
    "we use the finite - temperature version of the formalism , instead of the one used by kajueter and kotliar@xcite , valid at @xmath63 , as we are interested in the thermodynamic properties of correlated metals over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "we briefly outline the method used and refer the reader to the more detailed work recently published @xcite .",

    "we use fast fourier transforms to go back and forth from time to energy variables .",

    "numerically this condition is much easier and faster to handle than the luttinger one .",
    "results from both of these conditions agree equally well with results from exact diagonalization of finite clusters.@xcite finding @xmath79 takes around four to six iterations using broyden s method@xcite .",
    "\\(v ) the final step is the requirement that the lattice green s funtion , @xmath81 , coincides with the green function of the associated impurity problem given by the anderson hamiltonian .",
    "this condition is expressed in equation([bath ] ) .",
    "the above steps ( i)-(v ) are repeated until a self - consistent bath function is obtained . note that the calculations are kept on the imaginary frequency axis : this makes the computation much faster and more efficient with the use of fast fourier transform algorithms .",
    "analytical continuation to the real frequency axis is needed in order to compute the spectral densities entering the different transport quantities .",
    "this continuation is numerically implemented using pad approximants@xcite .",

    "we consider the low - temperature transport properties that follow from this form of the self energy .",

    "uhrig and vollhardt have shown how in the limit of large dimensions the umklapp processes lead to a finite conductivity.@xcite cox and grewe pointed out that in an anisotropic system when the electron velocity and momentum are no longer parallel that normal scattering can contribute to the resistivity.@xcite    in transition metals and heavy fermions the kadowaki - woods rule@xcite relates the coefficient @xmath69 to the linear coefficient for the specific heat , @xmath16 : @xmath95constant .",

    "as soon as the degree of frustration @xmath164 , then , the hall coefficient is non - zero , and , again at @xmath63 , independent of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the sign of the hall coefficient depends on the sign of the real part of the self - energy referred to the chemical potential .",
    "this means that , in general , it is possible to have a different sign for the thermopower and the hall factor at low temperatures depending on the shape of the bare density of states and the fermi energy .      at low temperatures the optical conductivity ( [ condxx ] ) reduces to @xmath165 where @xmath166 , similar to an expression first obtained by murata@xcite . for @xmath167 ,",

    "the temperature at which this peak appears corresponds approximately to the temperature at which there are no longer fermi liquid quasiparticles present ( see fig .",
    "the decreasing resistance with increasing temperature , characteristic of a semiconductor or insulator , is due to thermal excitations to the upper hubbard band .",

    "_ in conventional metals transport occurs by well - defined quasi - particles ; they have a wavelength ( @xmath176 ) much less than the mean - free path @xmath177 and so transport properties can be described by the boltzmann equation .",
    "however , if the scattering is sufficiently strong that the mean - free path is comparable to a lattice constant ( @xmath178 ) then @xmath179 and the quasi - particle concept breaks down .",
    "this is often referred to as the mott - ioffe - regel limit.@xcite for an isotropic three - dimensional metal this corresponds to a conductivity of @xmath180 and is sometimes referred to as the mott minimum conductivity . however , for a wide range of strongly correlated metals , including the cuprates@xcite , fullerene metals ( a@xmath181c@xmath182 ) ( ref . ) , the organic superconductors @xmath174(bedt - ttf)@xmath3x ( ref . ) , sr@xmath3ruo@xmath93 , ( ref . ) , srruo@xmath181 ( ref . ) , and vo@xmath3 ( ref . ) , it is observed that as the temperature increases the resistivity can increase to values corresponding to mean - free paths much less than a lattice constant .",
    "such materials have been referred to as `` bad metals.''@xcite in contrast , in the a-15 metals the resistivity appears to ` saturate ' at a high temperature value corresponding to the mott - ioffe - regel limit.@xcite however , it has recently been suggested that the resistivity does not saturate but rather a change in temperature dependence occurs when the scattering is strong enough to cause a breakdown of the migdal approximation.@xcite emery and kivelson proposed@xcite that the smooth temperature dependence of the resistance in bad metals suggests that the low - temperature transport is also not due to quasi - particles .    at low temperatures the resistivity given by ( [ rhot2 ] )",

    "[ thermot201 ] , we show the results for the thermopower as a function of temperature for different values of the coulomb interaction , @xmath7 and in the nearly symmetric case @xmath190 .",
    "the low temperature behaviour is correctly described by equation ( [ thermo ] ) .",
    "as it can be observed , the slope of the thermopower at low temperatures increases with increasing @xmath7 , scaling as the effective mass @xmath191 .",
    "we find a minimum in the thermopower which is rather shallow for small @xmath7 and becomes increasingly pronounced with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "a similar feature also occurs for doped mott insulators@xcite and for the anderson lattice.@xcite we observe that the mimimum moves to higher temperatures as @xmath125 is decreased .",
    "this is a consequence of the increase in the kondo scale with decreasing @xmath192 and is supported by the observation that this minimum follows the peak in the specific heat . to illustrate the close relationship between the thermopower and the specific heat , fig .",
    "[ cespt201 ] shows the specific heat for the same parameter values as fig .",
    "[ thermot201 ] .",
    "the peak in the specific heat , already analyzed by several authors @xcite , is associated with the binding energy of the kondo spin screening cloud which eventually forms at each lattice site .",
    "the high temperature behaviour found is typical of systems which have a depleted density of states at the fermi energy , for example , in semimetals and insulators one expects the magnitude of the thermopower to decrease as the temperature is decreased .",
    "this is more easily understood from the behaviour of the spectral densities which show this effective depletion of quasiparticle excitations at the fermi energy ( see fig.[spectu4t203 ] ) .    the change in sign of the thermopower at intermediate temperatures @xmath193 for @xmath194 ,",
    "can be explained from the fact that the spectral weight of the quasiparticle excitations is transferred mostly to the lower rather than to the upper hubbard band , making the holes , rather than the electrons , the dominant carriers contributing to energy transport ( see fig.[spectu4t203 ] ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that it is not necessary to get to too large values of @xmath125 to find a clear signature of the minimum in the thermopower and strong temperature behaviour .",
    "this is a feature which one can find in sufficiently correlated systems far from the mott transition as can be checked from the effective masses we obtain , @xmath195 , which in our calculations vary between 2 - 4 for @xmath196 and 4 , respectively .",
    "fig.[thermot203 ] shows the thermopower when the frustration is increased to @xmath197 .",
    "the magnitude of the thermopower is enhanced as a result of the larger asymmetry present in the particle - hole excitations of the system .",
    "thus , the slope at low temperatures is increased by a factor of about 3 , as expected from eq.([thermopt2 ] ) .",
    "the main features remain similar to the less frustrated case @xmath198 , although the minimum of the thermopower is more pronounced for a larger degree of frustration .",
    "the thermopower of the cuprates@xcite and the organic superconductors @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3x ( ref . ) , and @xmath199-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3x ( ref . ) have the common properties that it is not a monotonic function of temperature and has large values of order 10 - 50 @xmath19 v / k at 100 k. for the organics these properties can not be explained in terms of the calculated band structures and a weakly interacting fermi liquid.@xcite for sr@xmath3ruo@xmath93 the thermopower increases nonlinearly with temperature from 4 k to 300 k , appearing to saturate at high temperatures , and has the opposite sign as the hall coefficient.@xcite    as discussed above a peak or minimum in the thermopower is a signature of the decay of coherent excitations with increasing temperature .",
    "it is desirable to see if this feature can be observed in experiments on other strongly correlated metals .",
    "such a peak should be clearly distinguishable from a peak due to phonon drag@xcite by several features .",
    "the latter produces a thermopower which is proportional to the lattice specific heat and thus cubic in the temperature for @xmath200 . for higher temperatures",
    "the phonon drag thermopower goes like @xmath201 .",
    "the result is a peak around a temperature of 0.1 - 0.2 @xmath202 .",
    "values of @xmath202 can be deduced from the specific heat data .",
    "thus , it should be possible to distinguish whether an observed peak in a material is due to phonon drag or due to loss of fermi liquid coherence because of the different temperatures at which they occur and because of the different behaviour at higher temperatures .",
    "zhou and goodenough have observed peaks around 100 k in the thermopower of cavo@xmath181 @xcite and la@xmath203nd@xmath204cuo@xmath181.@xcite they attribute these peaks to phonon drag .",
    "this peak can not be due to the correlation effects considered here because it occurs at too low a temperature . in cavo@xmath181",
    "the optical conductivity still has a drude peak at 300 k,@xcite and it is estimated that @xmath9 = 1 ev and @xmath7 = 3 ev .",
    "consequently , the coherence temperature will be of the order of 1000 k.    the peak in the electronic specific heat would be extremely difficult to observe because it will be masked by the @xmath205 phonon contribution .",
    "in contrast , the phonon contribution to the thermopower decreases with increasing temperature and so should not mask the feature due to correlations .      in fig.[hallt201 ] and [ hallt203 ]",
    "we show results for the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient @xmath206 for @xmath190 and 0.3 , respectively .",
    "we observe from the curves that for small values of the @xmath125 ratio , the hall coefficient is nearly independent of temperature , whereas for larger values of the interaction there is an increase in the hall coefficient for increasing @xmath207 reaching a maximum at @xmath208 .",
    "this fact is observed for both values of the frustration shown .",
    "note that the sign of the hall coefficient is not necessarily the same as the sign of the thermopower .    for a given value of the frustration ,",
    "all curves converge to the same value at @xmath63 as expected from eq.([rh ] ) . however , the temperature dependence at low temperatures for @xmath209 differs from the @xmath210 case .",
    "the behaviour at low temperatures is determined by the temperature dependence of the chemical potential , which depends on the lattice analyzed through the bare density of states and the value of @xmath125 .",
    "for the case @xmath209 , the hall coefficient is more strongly dependent of @xmath7 than for the @xmath190 case .",
    "moreover , an upturn of the hall coefficient is found in the low - temperature limit @xmath163 in the latter case .",
    "this means that , although qualitatively the situation is similar for different degrees of frustration , some features can be enhanced and may depend on the details of the band structure and the bare density of states of the material .    the hall coefficient for a doped mott insulator on a simple hypercubic lattice was calculated previously by pruschke _",
    "et al._@xcite and lange and kotliar@xcite using dynamical mean - field theory and found to have a qualitatively similar temperature dependence .",

    "the behaviour and value below 1 k can be explained within a fermi liquid picture.@xcite however , the sign change can only be explained if the temperature dependence of the scattering rate in the different bands is significantly different.@xcite an alternative explanation for the temperature dependence is the decay of coherence discussed here .",
