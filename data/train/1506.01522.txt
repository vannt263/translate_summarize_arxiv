    "it was already recognized by peierls that normal scattering is the key point to understanding thermal conductivity  @xcite . however , the preference for a kinetic point of view and the insufficient data on micro and nanoscale samples in those years led to the success of callaway s proposal  @xcite , and therefore the need to treat normal and resistive processes on a different footing was never properly acknowledged .",
    "it has only been in recent years , with the appearance of thermal transport measurements at the nanoscale  @xcite , that the need for a deeper understanding has become evident , prompting some authors to work with modified expressions for the relaxation times , confinement effects or including new scattering mechanisms in the callaway model @xcite .",
    "solutions of the boltzmann equation with _ ab initio _ scattering rates with the proper inclusion of the role of normal ( n ) scattering have achieved in the last years a great level of accuracy , and the properties of large number of materials have been predicted without the need of any fitting parameter  @xcite .",

    "that , analytic expressions have been proposed from the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the relaxation times in order to be used in simple approximate models  @xcite .    in recent papers a different approach , the kinetic collective model ( kcm ) , has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on a combination of a kinetic and a collective contribution , weighted by the relative importance of normal _ vs. _ resistive processes .",
    "the main differences with a pure kinetic model are the introduction of a hydrodynamic ( collective ) flow which has a unique value for the relaxation time for all the modes and uses a form factor to include boundary effects .",
    "recent experimental works have demonstrated that pure kinetic models are not enough to understand thermal conductivity at short scales and times  @xcite . in these works ,",
    "collective flow has been used to explain the origin of the non - monotonous dependence of the thermal boundary resistance as a function of the size of the heater arising from ultrafast laser heating experiments  @xcite .",
    "also theoretically , collective transport has been successfully used to understand first - principles results on graphene thermal transport  @xcite , showing that poiseuille flow can be behind the high thermal conductivity of this material and thus converging with the kcm .",
    "collective models will be necessary in next years in order to analise these experiments and simulations .",
    "this kinetic collective model has been able to predict thermal conductivity of natural and isotope rich silicon bulk , and micro and nanoscaled samples by fitting only the natural bulk sample  @xcite . in a following work  @xcite",
    ", the calculations were extended to all group iv materials , significatively extending the predictability range of previous analytical models .",
    "a noticeable point is that the expressions for the relaxation times that seem to work better with the kcm are those obtained in the works by herring and klemens  @xcite , pointing to the possibility that the problems appearing in the last decades when predicting thermal conductivity may not be related to the relaxation times , but rather to the insuficient attention to this collective regime .    in this letter",
    "we go a step forward in the kcm and predict the thermal conductivity in si / ge bulk and nanowire alloys from the _ same _ natural silicon fitting already used in ref .  .",
    "from our predictions we demonstrate that the difficulty of predicting the thermal conductivity in this kind of samples is related to the change from a collective to a kinetic dominated flow .",
    "the fact that such a variety of materials , isotope fractions , alloy compositions , and length scales is correctly described by the kcm is a very strong indicator of its validity as an analysis , prediction and optimization tool .    from the kcm ,",

    "expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given elsewhere  @xcite .    in order to compute the properties of si@xmath10ge@xmath11 alloys , we need the phonon dispersion relations and the relaxation times . to obtain the dispersion relations for a stochiometry @xmath12 , we perform lattice dynamics calculations within the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) in an _ ab initio _ framework  @xcite .",

    "the lattice parameter was adjusted until the pressure was less than 0.1  kbar .",
    "solution of the ensuing dynamical matrix provided the sought dispersion relations and derived quantities .    in this kind of alloys four different relaxation times should be considered ; three of them are significatively contributing to the total resistivity , and they should be combined using mathiessen s rule @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boundary term , @xmath15 the umklapp contribution and @xmath16 the impurity term .",

    "note that collective transport is only important for very pure materials ( si or ge ) , with impurity fractions of the order of 0.5% already destroying most of the collective regime .",
    "the prediction given by the current proposal in this region is in remarkable agreement with experimental results from @xcite , showing that in order to have a model able to predict at the same time the thermal conductivity for pure and alloyed materials , proper description of the evolution of the collective contribution is needed , which is achieved in the kcm by the inclusion of @xmath8 .",
    "this might be the reason why pure kinetic expressions need an extra parameter in the alloy term  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_size ] we represent the kinetic and collective contributions for two different situations , for pure silicon at the top and si@xmath47ge@xmath48 at the bottom . in pure si",
    ", it can be observed that in the region where the thermal conductivity is not affected by size effects , the kinetic / collective fraction does not change significatively . when boundary effects are noticeable , the reduction in the collective flux is more important and the ratio kinetic / collective raises .",
    "this is because boundary scattering is resistive and its appearance reduces the weight of the collective term .",
    "we notice that the disappearance of the collective contribution is the responsible for a much stronger decrease in thermal conductivity in the @xmath491  @xmath50m10  nm range compared to the micron and above scale .. present results agree with recent works pointing on the direction that long mean free path phonons are important to predict thermal conductivity in alloy samples @xcite . for the alloy sample , in the bottom figure , the collective term has been completely eliminated due to the impurity scattering and boundary scattering does not change the regime . also , the functional dependence with sample size is completely different in both samples .",
    "the alloy shows the @xmath51 divergence expected for kinetic samples dominated by boundary scattering  @xcite while the change in the slope in the pure si case seems to be behind the destruction of the collective term regime , leaving a linear dependence with size at low temperatures .",
    "high - frequency phonons in the collective regime drag low frequency phonons , and the increase with sample size is much reduced at high temperatures  @xcite .    to show the predictive capability of the kcm in nanometer alloyed samples , in figure  [ fig : alloy_nw ] we have plotted the thermal conductivity for bulk silicon and germanium , as well as a selection of si / ge alloy nanowires .",
    "all the curves , showing a remarkable agreement with the experimental points , are calculated from the same single fit to natural bulk silicon , indicating that the change in the collective / kinetic ratio seems to be the key in predicting this kind of attribute . for pure si nanowires",
    "@xcite , alternative interpretations based on a purely diffusive viewpoint have been proposed@xcite ; nevertheless the kcm has been able to adjust the results by li _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as well as the sige alloy nanowires in fig .",
    "[ fig : alloy_nw ] . while surface roughness in nanowires may have an important impact on thermal conductivity  @xcite ,",
    "we havent included it in our analysis because the wires in ref .   had sub - nm roughness .      in conclusion ,",
    "thermal conductivity values derived from the kinetic collective model for pure si , ge and alloy si / ge samples ranging from bulk to nanowires for a wide range of temperatures show excellent agreement with experimental data , based on a single fit to natural bulk silicon .",
    "no further adjustable parameters are needed , showing that the difficulty in previous attempts to fit wide ranges of temperature , sizes and compositions seems to be related with the transition from the collective to the kinetic regime experienced by a sample with increasing resistive scattering .",
    "this , together with the fact that the expressions for the relaxations times agree with theoretical predictions without any modification , gives plausibility to the model .",
    "boundaries and species variation reduce the collective transport in alloys , with alloy scattering a more effective mechanism than boundary scattering .",
    "alloy concentrations as little as 0.5% or system sizes of the order of 10  nm will destroy the collective contribution to the thermal conductivity .",
