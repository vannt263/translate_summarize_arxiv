    "the hubbard model is the simplest system which presumably incorporates the key features of the strong correlation limit .",
    "understanding this model will be crucial for making any progress with cuprate superconductors , colossal magneto resistance systems or heavy fermions .",
    "the special problem in this model is that near half - filling it represents a dense system of strongly interacting fermions , a situation in which a perturbation expansion in @xmath0 may not be expected to give any meaningful results . in dealing with this model , one",
    "can then pursue two opposing strategies : one might expect that despite the strong interaction a perturbation expansion in @xmath0 remains a meaningful approximation , and apply conventional many - body theory .",
    "the latter means that one is treating the kinetic energy exactly , and results in the validity of the luttinger theorem .",
    "on the other hand , by adiabatic continuity this approach will never produce an insulator at half - filling so that we can be sure of its breakdown in the limit of large @xmath4 .",
    "+ the opposite point of view was taken by hubbard@xcite : in his approximations , the interaction part of @xmath5 is treated exactly and approximations are made to the kinetic energy .",
    "this results in the breakdown of the luttinger theorem , because the physical electron is effectively split into two particles , one of them corresponding to an electron moving between empty sites , the other to an electron moving between sites occupied by an electron of opposite spin .",
    "the energies of formation of these effective particles differ by @xmath0 , whence for large @xmath0 the single free - electron band splits up into two bands formed predominantly by the two types of effective particles .",
    "hubbard s approximations , and related schemes like the so - called @xmath6-pole approximations@xcite , have been dismissed by some authors as unphysical , because they do in fact violate the luttinger theorem away from half - filling . however , in a recent qmc study for the paramagnetic phase of the hubbard model@xcite we have shown that such criticism is entirely unwarranted : the fermi surface , if measured in an ` operational way ' from the fermi energy crossings of the quasiparticle band , indeed does violate the luttinger theorem .",
    "the doping dependence of the fermi surface volume is qualitatively consistent with hubbard s results and the main discrepancy being the fact that one can rather clearly distinguish @xmath7 ` bands ' in the spectral functions rather than the @xmath6 bands predicted by the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "more generally , exact diagonalization studies@xcite tend to produce for example a photoemission spectrum consisting of a relatively narrow ` quasiparticle band ' ( which forms the first ionization states ) and an ` incoherent continuum '",
    ". a simple two - band form of the spectrum , as produced by the hubbard - i approximation , therefore can not give a quantitative description of the spectrum .",
    "motivated by these numerical results we have re - examined the hubbard i approximation and attempted to find the most important corrections to this scheme for the limit of large @xmath0 and weak spin correlations .",
    "we will see that the @xmath7-band structure observed in the qmc simulations can be reproduced quite well by adding two new effective particles which correspond to a composite object of a ` hubbard quasiparticle ' and a spin- , charge- , or @xmath1-excitation .",
    "these composite objects actually are the quite obvious leading correction over the hubbard - i approximation , and we will see that including them into the equations of motion leads to an almost quantitative agreement with the numerical results for a variety of different systems .",
    "we consider the hubbard hamiltonian in particle - hole symmetric form , @xmath8 with : @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes summation over all pairs of nearest neighbors and @xmath11 . + for",
    "bipartite lattices one can make use of two symmetry transformations .",
    "the first one is the particle - hole transformation : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "if the kinetic energy contains only nearest neighbor hopping , this transformation leaves the hamiltonian invariant and exchanges the electron addition spectrum for momentum @xmath14 and removal spectrum for momentum @xmath15 at half - filling .",
    "similarly the transformation @xmath16 , @xmath17 inverts the sign of @xmath18@xcite . at half - filling this allows to transform solutions of the positive - u model into those of the negative - u model .",
    "this transformation implies that the single - particle spectral function at half - filling is identical for positive and negative @xmath0 . in the appendix some of the operators introduced in this work and",
    "their transformation properties under these transformations are listed .",
    "+ we proceed with the calculation of the single - particle green s function . as a first step ,",

    "we specialize to half - filling ( @xmath29 ) and introduce the green s functions @xmath30 where @xmath31 . then , using the anticommutator relations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 we obtain the following equations of motion : @xmath35 taking into account that the ordinary electron green s function @xmath36 and the green s function called @xmath37 by hubbard@xcite can be written as @xmath38 the resulting equations of motions are precisely those derived in the hubbard - i approximation : @xmath39 the present formulation , on the other hand , allows for an appealing physical interpretation of the hubbard - i approximation : we introduce free fermion operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which correspond to ` holes ' and ` double occupancies ' .",
    "the hubbard operators are identified with these as follows : @xmath42 then , we can formally obtain the set of equations of motion ( [ simp ] ) from the following hamiltonian for the holes and double occupancies : @xmath43 the hamiltonian ( [ hubre ] ) is a quadratic form and readily solved by bogoliubov transformation : @xmath44 to yield the familiar dispersion relation @xmath45 . \\label{hubdisp}\\ ] ] to compute the spectral weight of the two bands we use @xmath46 , whence @xmath47 again , this is the correct hubbard - i result .",
    "the above discussion shows the physical content of the hubbard - i approximation : the hamiltonian ( [ hubre ] ) describes fermionic particle - like and hole - like charge fluctuations , created by @xmath41 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "these ` live ' in a background of singly occupied sites .",
    "particle - like and hole - like charge fluctuations are created in pairs on nearest neighbors , and individually can hop between nearest neighbors .",
    "the hopping integral for the hole - like particle has opposite sign as that for the electron - like fluctuation as it has to be , and the hopping integrals for both effective particles are @xmath49 times that for the ordinary electrons : this reflects the fact that due to the pauli principle ( say ) a spin up electron added to a ` background ' of singly occupied sites can propagate to a neighboring site only with a probability of @xmath49 ( we are neglecting any spin correlations of the background of singly occupied sites ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath50 in ( [ egon ] ) is due to the fact that @xmath51 .",
    "finally , the particle which stands for the double occupancy has an energy of formation of @xmath52 , the hole - like particle has an energy of @xmath53 .",
    "as already mentioned , the hubbard i approximation therefore describes the splitting of the physical electron into two new effective particles which carry with them information on the ` environment ' in which the electron has been created .",
    "one of them ( @xmath54 ) moves between sites occupied by an electron of opposite spin , the other one ( @xmath55 ) between empty sites .",
    "this is a quite appealing physical idea , but the above formulation also very clearly highlights the weak points of the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "in addition to the mere truncation of the commutators ( [ commu ] ) , which is an uncontrolled approximation , these are the following : adopting this picture we would have to assume that the states @xmath56 and @xmath57 are distinguishable ( and in fact orthogonal to one another ) .",
    "this , however , is in general not the case : both states have one double occupancy on site @xmath58 and a hole on site @xmath28 , and the only difference is that they have been created in different ways .",
    "in fact , using ( [ egon ] ) we find for their overlap @xmath59 where we have assumed a rotationally invariant ground state in the second line .",
    "the hubbard - like approximation scheme thus should work only for a state with vanishing spin correlations - we will therefore henceforth assume the spin correlation function @xmath60 to be zero .",
    "+ a second problem is , that the effective fermions have to obey a kind of hard - core constraint - a site can not be simultaneously occupied by a hole and a double - occupancy .",
    "this constraint is not accounted for in the derivation of the hubbard - i approximation : the equations of motion are obtained from the hamiltonian ( [ hubre ] ) by treating the @xmath61 and @xmath62 as ordinary free fermion operators .",
    "this problem is the source of the violation of certain sum - rules when the hubbard - i approximation is applied in the doped case , see the discussion given by avella _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "+ one last remark is that the commutators ( [ commu ] ) are invariant under the particle - hole transformation , i.e. they are transformed into each others hermitian conjugate .",
    "this remains true for the truncated commutators , which give the hubbard - i approximation , so that the spectral function obtained from this is particle - hole symmetric .",
    "this can also be verified directly using ( [ hubdisp ] ) and ( [ hubweight ] ) .",
    "finally , the spectral function is manifestly invariant under sign change of @xmath0 , as it has to be .",
    "we now want to try and derive an improved version of the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "thereby we will address neither the problem of nonorthogonality of different hole / double - occupancy configurations nor the hard - core constraint - instead , in this work we will restrict ourselves entirely to an approximate way of treating the omitted terms in the commutator relations ( [ commu ] ) .",
    "we expect that the present approximation is reasonable for large @xmath0 ( where the density of holes / double occupancies is small whence the hard - core constraint is of little importance ) and weak spin correlations ( where the nonorthogonality problem is small ) . throughout",
    "we stick to the case of half - filling and no spin polarization , @xmath63 .",
    "we return to the basic commutator relations ( [ commu ] ) and consider the terms on the r.h.s . which are omitted in the hubbard - i scheme .",
    "the second term in the square bracket is the clebsch - gordan contraction of the spin-1/2 operator @xmath64 and the spin-1 operator @xmath65 into yet another spin-1/2 operator - it describes the coupling of the created hole / annihilated double occupancy to spin excitations .",
    "this term may be expected to be the most important one in the limit of large positive @xmath0 .",
    "the third term describes in an analogous way the coupling to density fluctuations , whereas the last term describes the coupling to the so - called @xmath1-pair excitation@xcite .",
    "one may expect that in the case of _ negative _ @xmath0 the last two terms are the important ones . + in keeping with the basic idea of the hubbard approximations , namely to treat the dominant interaction terms exactly , we split also the composite operator into eigenoperators of the @xmath0-term and define : @xmath66 where @xmath67 . under the positive / negative @xmath0 transformation we have for example @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 , i.e. keeping the at first sight unimportant ( for positive @xmath0 ) terms involving density and pairing fluctuations",

    "following the discussion in the preceding section we can calculate the full electron green s function , including the ( presumably ) most important corrections over the hubbard i approximation in the limit of weak spin correlations and large @xmath0 .",
    "we now proceed to a comparison of the obtained results results for the spectral density @xmath114 , with the spectral density obtained from quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",

    "moreover , the value of @xmath128 is already rather large , so that we may also hope to have a small density of holes / double occupancies and the neglect of the hard - core constraint be justified . as a general remark concerning the qmc spectra we note that the maxent procedure used for the analytic continuation to the real axis es most reliable for ` features ' with large weight - this means that the position of tiny peaks is less accurate than that of large ones .",
    "+ figure [ fig2 ] then compares the spectral density obtained from the hubbard i approximation , our extended hubbard approximation ( eha ) and qmc simulation .",
    "the hubbard i approximation gives only a relatively crude fit to the actual spectral density obtained by qmc .",
    "the extended hubbard approximation , on the other hand , gives an all in all quite correct description of the spectral density . out of the @xmath129 bands produced by diagonalizing @xmath89 , only four bands do have an appreciable spectral weight .",
    "these four intense bands correspond rather well to @xmath7 broad ` bands ' of intense spectral weight which can be roughly identified in the qmc result .",
    "it is interesting to note that a recent strong - coupling expansion for the hubbard model by pairault _ et al._@xcite also produced a @xmath7-band structure , although only for the 1d model .",
    "the dispersion of the spectral weight along the bands is also reproduced quite satisfactorily be the extended hubbard approximation .",
    "the main difference is the apparently strongly @xmath14-dependent width of the spectra produced by qmc , which however is outside the scope of the present approximation , which ( in the limit @xmath130 ) produces sharp @xmath131-peaks without any broadening .",
    "a more severe deficiency of the eha is , that it tends to predict too high excitation energies , resulting in a somewhat too large value of the hubbard gap . in any way",
    ", however , the magnitude of the hubbard gap comes out better than in the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "+ we proceed to the hubbard model with an additional hopping integral @xmath2 between @xmath121 nearest ( i.e. ( 1,1)-like ) neighbors .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] again compares the hubbard i approximation , the eha , and the results of a qmc simulation on an @xmath132 lattice .",
    "the agreement between eha and the qmc result is again quite good , the main discrepancy being again an overall overestimation of the binding energies . on the other hand , the apparent @xmath7-band structure ,",
    "the dispersion of the peak energies and the spectral weight agrees well with the numerical result . in particular , the @xmath6 bands in inverse photoemission ( i.e. @xmath133 ) predicted by the eha can be seen very clearly in the qmc spectra ) .",
    "all in all the agreement is even better than for the case @xmath134 , which most probably is due to the fact that the spin correlations are weaker with @xmath2 , so that the assumption of an uncorrelated spin state is better justified in this case .",
    "+ we proceed to the case of a hopping integral integral @xmath3 between @xmath122 nearest ( i.e. ( 2,0)-like ) neighbors . here",
    "we have chosen @xmath135 , because for the larger value @xmath136 the qmc simulation still predicted a metallic state at @xmath128 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the spectral functions for @xmath135 .",
    "again , we can roughly identify @xmath7 bands and there is reasonable agreement for the dispersion .",
    "the weight of the quasiparticle band in photoemission near @xmath137 ( at @xmath138 ) is not reproduced very well by the eha , but again the ubiquitous @xmath7-band structure is rather clearly visible .",
    "+ next , we turn to a somewhat indirect check of the approximation . the ordinary electron creation operator is the symmetric combination of the hubbard operators .",
    "however , we might also define the antisymmetric combination @xmath139 this operator has the same quantum numbers as the original electron operator , and therefore obeys the same selection rules .",
    "it follows that when acting on the ground state , this operator probes the same final states as the electron operator , the only difference being the matrix element viz . the spectral weight of the respective peak in the spectral density .",
    "in fact the green s function @xmath140 can be expressed as @xmath141 it therefore is easy to calculate within our approximation , and comparison with the qmc result provides an additional check for our description of the electronic structure .",
    "note that the operator @xmath142 enhances the practically dispersionless bands at @xmath143 - since these bands now have a larger weight , their position and dispersion are more reliable than in the ` ordinary ' photoemission spectrum .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig5 ] , where indeed quite good agreement is found between the eha and the numerical result .",
    "+ finally , we turn to the discussion of choosing a nonvanishing expectation value of the anticommutator in ( [ anticomm ] ) , i.e. we assume that @xmath144 .",
    "this changes the rhs of the equation system ( [ eqnsys ] ) to @xmath145 but leaves the matrix @xmath89 unchanged .",
    "in other words , the _ dispersion _ of the bands , which is determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath89 stays unchanged and only the spectral weight of the peaks changes .",
    "moreover the sum rules ( [ sumrule1 ] ) and ( [ sumrule2 ] ) retain their validity also in this case . for large positive @xmath0 and @xmath146 charge fluctuations will be strongly suppressed and double occupancies will have a small probability , so that the dominant contribution to @xmath147 comes from the spin correlation function @xmath148 , whence we should choose @xmath149 .",
    "assuming for example a negative @xmath147 of moderate value , @xmath150 , then leads to little change in the calculated spectral density ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) : the same two bands which had a large spectral weight for @xmath151 retain a large spectral weight also in this case .",
    "there is , however , a rather undesirable feature associated with the bands with small spectral weight : numerical evaluation shows , that for some regions of @xmath14-space these bands acquire a small but _ negative _ weight .",
    "+ the physical origin of this problem is probably related to nonorthogonalities of basis states : in principle we could interpret the matrix @xmath89 as a hamiltonian describing ( in 2d with only nearest neighbor hopping ) @xmath152 types of fermionic ` effective particles ' .",
    "quite generally , the anticommutator - relation @xmath153 implies that the wave functions corresponding to the fermi operators @xmath154 and @xmath155 are non - orthogonal .",
    "while an exact overlap matrix can never have negative eigenvalues but at most develop zero eigenvalues ( indicating that the set of basis states is overcomplete ) , any approximation to the matrix elements may lead , as an artefact of the approximation , to negative eigenvalues . since we are using only approximate values for the overlaps",
    ", it may happen that we obtain states with a nominally negative norm , whence we can get poles of negative weight . setting @xmath151 throughout amounts to assuming that all our effective particles are orthogonal to one another and obviously removes the problem with nonorthogonalities .",
    "this seems reasonable , because we are neglecting overlap terms proportional to the spin correlation function already in the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "the lesson then is basically the same as discussed already before : the hubbard - i approximation is well defined only when applied to an ` ideally paramagnetic ' state with no correlations of finite range , and applying it to a state with finite spin correlations represents an approximation .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the most important corrections over the hubbard - i approximation in the limit @xmath156 and electron density @xmath146 .",
    "we have seen that the hubbard - i approximation describes charge fluctuations on a ` background ' of singly occupied sites , which is moreover assumed to have zero spin correlations .",
    "the charge fluctuations are point - like , and correspond to an electron moving between empty sites and an electron moving between singly occupied sites .",
    "we note that a very similar construction can also be applied to the kondo lattice@xcite and in fact reproduces the single particle spectra very well .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the kondo lattice has a unique ground state in the limit of zero kinetic energy , whereas the ground state of the hubbard model is highly degenerate in the case @xmath157 .",
    "+ in our extended scheme for the hubbard model we have augmented these point - like charge fluctuations by additional ` particles ' which are composite in character and consist of a point - like charge fluctuation together with a spin- , density- , or @xmath1-excitation .",
    "comparison of the obtained single - particle spectral density with qmc results for a variety of systems showed a quite reasonable agreement .",
    "in particular the apparent @xmath7-band structure seen in the numerical spectra finds its natural explanation in the extended hubbard approximation .",
    "we also note that qmc simulations where the spectra of the composite excitations have actually been computed@xcite , further support the present interpretation .",
    "we thus have a quite successful method of computing the full quasiparticle band structure of the hubbard model , at least in the paramagnetic case and at half - filling .",
    "+ the present scenario for the nature of the composite excitations also allows to make a connection with various theories for the hole motion in an antiferromagnet@xcite .",
    "there , one is describing holes dressed by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "when acting on the nel state the operators @xmath72 obviously describe precisely a hole together with a ` spin wave ' on a nearest neighbor or , put another way , a ` string ' of length one .",
    "the terms which were omitted from the equation of motion for the @xmath72 then would correspond to strings of length two and so on . while such longer - ranged strings are apparently of minor importance in the paramagnetic phase , one may expect that they become more and more important for the description of the dispersion the stronger the antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the relative importance of such longer ranged strings therefore may be the mechanism for the crossover from the hubbard - i like dispersion in the paramagnetic phase to the spin - density - wave like dispersion in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "similarly , one might think of formulating the entire hubbard - i approximation also in the antiferromagnetic phase , by constructing the hamiltonian for charge fluctuations explicitly for a nel ordered spin background .",
