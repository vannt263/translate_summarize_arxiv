    "the @xmath15 as well as the @xmath16 have zero spin and odd intrinsic parity , i.e. @xmath17 , and thus conservation of momentum and angular momentum require that the decay products @xmath18 and @xmath19 possess the same helicity .",
    "this decay provides an ideal laboratory to search for the pseudoscalar ( p ) weak interaction , because only the p interaction allows the selection rule for the @xmath20 transition for nearly massless neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "other exotic effects such as the presence of a right - handed weak current through the exchange of a @xmath21 would also allow such decays .",
    "the information derived from @xmath22 and @xmath23 are complementary because the former is sensitive only to the isovector neutral - current ( nc ) interactions while the latter is sensitive to the isoscalar nc interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 decays involve only u- and d - quarks while @xmath15 decays additionally involve the s - quark and perhaps other heavier quarks . if the @xmath24 couples to a massive neutrino with the standard weak - interaction strength , the branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath25 and @xmath26 have maximum values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite , respectively at the @xmath29 mass upper limit of @xmath30 mev/@xmath31 @xcite .",

    "to date no exclusive limits have been set on @xmath36 in any experiment . the particle data group ( pdg)@xcite reports an inclusive upper limit of @xmath37 from the bes - ii collaboration@xcite , corresponding to an upper limit on the br for @xmath38 of @xmath39 .",
    "the bes - ii results are inclusive results obtained by using @xmath40 @xmath41 decays .",
    "possible @xmath38 decay products could be light dark matter ( ldm ) particles or light neutralinos .",
    "these ldm particles may have an adequate relic density to account for the non - baryonic mass of the universe .",
    "our estimated icecube limits will be complementary to bes - ii limits since the sm neutrinos would be a component of bes - ii reported inclusive measurements .",

    "due to its long lifetime most @xmath81 reach the ground before decaying . because the atmospheric @xmath68 background is significantly less than the atmospheric @xmath74 background , we concentrate on searches for @xmath70 and @xmath82 .",
    "interactions of high energy atmospheric neutrinos in icecube can be classified as events with a long muon track or as cascade events with very localized energy deposited in the detector .",
    "the muon events are due to charged - current ( cc ) @xmath83 interaction while the cascade events are mainly from cc @xmath5 and to a lesser extent from nc @xmath5 and @xmath83 .",

    "this is because both @xmath16 and @xmath15 with very short lifetimes ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) do not interact and lose energy before decaying , while charged pions and kaons with much longer lifetimes interact substantially with the atmosphere before decaying .",
    "the corresponding integral spectra are shown in fig .",
    "the flux of background neutrinos from the lower hemisphere ( @xmath97 ) is practically equal to the flux from the upper hemisphere because neutrino absorption in the earth is approximately compensated by the larger atmosphere depth in the case of upward - going neutrinos originating from the northern hemisphere .",
    "the flux of neutrinos induced by @xmath16 and @xmath15 decays slightly depend on atmospheric depth in the range of 700 - 1000 g/@xmath98 .",
    "the corsika generated neutrinos from @xmath16 and @xmath15 decays with a cteq6 parton distribution model and the corresponding cross sections for cc and nc were calculated according to the formalism employed by reno @xcite .",

    "the interaction vertices were distributed uniformly throughout the detector volume .",
    "the geant cerenkov code together with the input icecube geometry with average pmt quantum efficiency as well as an ice model with appropriate absorption and scattering @xcite simulated the hit pmts .",
    "the resulting trigger efficiencies for number of hit pmts @xmath101 are 0.75 and 0.70 for @xmath102 and the atmospheric background due to k and @xmath6 decays , respectively .",
    "[ etasp ] shows the energy distributions of the possible signal and the background events .",
    "we also estimated the atmospheric background due to cascades from @xmath9 nc interaction with nuclei as well as cc @xmath9 interactions where the muon is not detected due to edge effects .",
    "these types of events have a trigger efficiency of 0.30 and contribute only at a @xmath103 level and have been included in the atmospheric neutrino background . the atmospheric @xmath104 contribution to the background are small below 10 tev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , above a few tev prompt @xmath105 s from charm decay must be taken into consideration@xcite .",

    "@xmath109 is the systematic uncertainty in the number of background events , and @xmath110 is the estimated number of @xmath15 decay events assuming @xmath71 br .",
    "note in the above expression and the figure , the systematic uncertainties are mainly from two sources , the primary cosmic ray flux and cross sections .",
    "these uncertainties are energy dependent and a full analysis of them would include uncertainties in flux calculations and uncertainties associated with particle production cross sections .",
    "we estimated these uncertainties based on the energy - dependent flux uncertainties reported by agrawal , et al . @xcite and those reported by derome @xcite .",
    "uncertainties for the neutrino production cross sections reported by the two references is @xmath103 .",
    "the relative primary nucleon flux systematic error is due to uncertainties in equation 2 and @xmath107 simulations and can be approximated by @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
