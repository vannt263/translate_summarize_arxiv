    "ob associations were first recognized by @xcite and @xcite as extended moving groups of blue luminous stars .",
    "they are defined as loose stellar systems ( stellar mass density of @xmath5 ) containing o- and/or early b - type stars ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at such low densities ,",
    "the associations are unstable against galactic tidal forces , and therefore it follows from their definition that ob associations must be young ( @xmath6  myr ) entities",
    ". most of their low - mass members are therefore still in their pre - main sequence ( pms ) phase .",
    "there are different models for the origin of ob associations .",
    "one possibility is that they start as initially dense clusters , which get unbound and expand quickly as soon as the massive stars expel the gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative model assumes that ob associations originate from _ unbound _ turbulent giant molecular clouds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e.  start already in a spatially extended configuration and thus form in a fundamentally different way than dense , gravitationally bound clusters .",
    "many well investigated ob associations show remarkably small internal velocity dispersions ( often @xmath7  km / sec ) , which are in some cases much smaller than required to explain the large present - day size ( typically tens of parsecs ) by expansion over the age of the association .",
    "this excludes the expanding cluster model and provides strong support for an origin as an extended unbound cloud for these associations .",
    "the considerable number of ob associations in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that they account for a large , maybe the dominant , fraction of the total galactic star formation .",
    "a good knowledge of their stellar content is thus essential in order to understand the nature of the star formation process not only in ob associations but also on galactic scales .    for many years",
    "star formation was supposed to be a bimodal process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) according to which high- and low - mass stars should form in totally different sites .",
    "although it has been long established that low - mass stars _ can _ form alongside their high - mass siblings in nearby ob associations ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is still not well known _",
    "what quantities _ of low - mass stars are produced in ob environments .",
    "there have been many claims that high - mass star forming regions have a truncated initial mass function ( imf ) , i.e.  contain much smaller numbers of low - mass stars than expected from the field imf ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "possible explanations for such an effect are often based on the strong radiation and winds from the massive stars .",
    "for example , increased radiative heating of molecular clouds may raise the jeans mass ; lower - mass cloud cores may be completely dispersed by photoevaporation before low - mass protostars can even begin to form ; the radiative destruction of co molecules should lead to a change in the equation of state of the cloud material , affecting the fragmentation processes and ultimately leading to the formation of a few massive stars rather than the `` normal '' imf which is dominated by low - mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , several well investigated massive star forming regions show _ no _ evidence for an imf cutoff ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the cases of ngc  3603 , 30  dor , and ngc  346 , respectively ) , and notorious difficulties in imf determinations of distant regions may easily lead to wrong conclusions about imf variations ( see , e.g. , discussion in * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the imf in ob associations is not truncated and similar to the field imf , it would follow that most @xmath8 of the total stellar mass is found in low - mass @xmath9 stars .",
    "this would then imply that most of the current galactic star formation is taking place in ob associations ( as initially suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the _ typical _ environment for forming stars ( and planets ) would be close to massive stars and not in isolated regions like taurus .",
    "the presence of nearby massive stars affects the evolution of young stellar objects and their protoplanetary disks in ob environments .",
    "for example , photoevaporation by intense uv radiation can remove a considerable amount of circumstellar material around young stellar objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these objects will therefore ultimately end up with smaller final masses than if they were located in isolated regions @xcite . although generally considered to be a threat for forming planetary systems , photoevaporation may actually help to form planets , as it seems to play an important role in the formation of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "ob associations provide excellent targets to investigate these effects on the formation and evolution of low - mass stars ( and their forming planetary systems ) during ages between a few myr and a few ten myr .",
    "however , before one can study the low - mass members , one first has to find them .",
    "although this statement sounds trivial , the major obstacle on the way towards a reliable knowledge of the low - mass population in ob associations is the problem to identify the individual low - mass members . unlike stellar clusters , which can be easily recognized on the sky ,",
    "ob associations are generally very inconspicuous : since they extend over huge areas in the sky ( often several hundred square - degrees for the nearest examples ) , most stars in the area actually are unrelated foreground or background stars . finding the association members among these field stars",
    "is often like finding needles in a haystack .",
    "as the low - mass members are often too faint for proper - motion studies , the only reliable sign to discern between low - mass association members and unrelated , much older field stars is the strength of the 6708   lithium line in the stellar spectrum : at ages of @xmath10  myr , the low - mass association members still have most of their initial li preserved and show a strong li line , whereas the older foreground and background field stars do not show this line since they have already depleted their primordial li ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , an accurate measurement of li line width requires at least intermediate resolution spectroscopy , and thus the observational effort to identify the widespread population of pms stars among the many thousands of field stars is huge .",
    "many empirical imf determinations are therefore based on photometric data only ; while this strategy rather easily provides a complete spatial coverage and allows one to work with large samples , photometry alone can not give completely reliable membership information .",
    "most studies with spectroscopically identified member samples , on the other hand , include only very small fractions of the total stellar population and are strongly affected by small number statistics and the necessity of using large extrapolation factors .",
    "therefore , most studies dealing with ob associations have been restricted to estimating the number - ratio of low - mass versus high - mass members ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "during the last years , new and very powerful multiple - object spectrographs like 2df at the anglo - australian telescope ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) made large spectroscopic surveys for low - mass pms members feasible . in combination with the hipparcos results , which allowed the complete identification of the high- and intermediate - mass @xmath11 stellar population in many nearby associations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , studies of the _ complete _ stellar population in ob associations are now possible , enabling us to investigate in detail the spatial and temporal relationships between high- and low - mass members .    in this chapter , we review the state of knowledge regarding the stellar populations of the nearest ob association : scorpius - centaurus ( sco ob2 ) .",
    "we structure this chapter in the following manner .",
    "section  2 gives a general , and historical , overview of the association and its subgroups .",
    "sections 3 , 4 , and 5 discuss the surveys for the members of the three primary subgroups of sco - cen : upper scorpius , upper centaurus - lupus , and lower centaurus - crux , respectively .",
    "readers uninterested in the individual surveys may want to skip ahead to section  6 , where we discuss the astrophysical ramifications , and interpretations , of studies of the sco - cen members .",
    "the scorpius - centaurus ( sco - cen ) association is the ob association nearest to the sun ( see fig .  [ nearby_ob.fig ] ) .",
    "it contains at least @xmath3150 b stars which concentrate in the three subgroups upper scorpius ( us ) , upper centaurus - lupus ( ucl ) , and lower centaurus - crux ( lcc ; fig .",

    "there is one o - type star associated with sco - cen : the runaway o9v star @xmath12 oph .",
    "the currently recognized sco ob2 subgroups were defined by @xcite : subgroup # 2 is us , # 3 is ucl , and # 4 is lcc . derived ages for the b - type stars in the different subgroups from the main sequence turnoff in the hr diagram and found that upper scorpius is the youngest subgroup ( @xmath13  myr ) , whereas lower centaurus crux ( @xmath14  myr ) and upper centaurus - lupus ( @xmath15  myr ) are considerably older  myr for lower centaurus - crux and @xmath16  myr for upper centaurus - lupus . ] .      although the focus of our review is the low - mass membership of sco - cen , it is worth reviewing the history regarding the unveiling of the group s membership . for most of the past century",
    "`` sco - cen '' was studied as a single entity , and only the highest mass members ( earlier than b5-type ) were called `` members '' with any degree of confidence . the discovery of the low - mass population ( fgkm stars ) in large numbers has only recently become technically feasible .",
    "many early studies of sco - cen involved isolating the members from the field population through kinematic and photometric means .",
    "sco - cen contained a large sample of b - type stars with large , convergent proper motions , which provided a critical lower rung in the galactic ( and cosmic ) distance ladder ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our brief historical review here is not exhaustive , but complements the recent summary by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their sect .",
    "4.1 ) .    around 1910 ,",
    "large compilations of proper motion and spectral type data were becoming available for galactic structure investigations ",
    "primarily lewis boss s ( 1910 ) _ preliminary general catalog _ and the spectral type compilations from the henry draper memorial project ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite appears to have been the first to make a convincing case that the b - type `` helium '' stars in the scorpius - centaurus region demonstrate convergent proper motions , and constituted a moving group .",
    "subsequent work on the association during the early 20th century revolved around testing the reality of the group , ascertaining its membership , and ( most importantly for the rest of the astronomical community ) estimating the group s distance .",
    "the importance of understanding , and exploiting , this conspicuous group of bright b - type stars was not lost on @xcite : `` _ the real question of importance is this : is the parallelism and equality of motion in this part of the sky [ sco - cen ] of such a nature that we can derive individual parallaxes ? _ ''",
    "the reality of sco - cen as a moving group was challenged , most notably , by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "some primary objections raised by these authors were that ( 1 ) the convergent point of the sco - cen proper motions was so close to the solar antapex that it could be construed simply as solar reflex motion on unrelated b - type stars in the field , ( 2 ) the group was so dispersed that it should disintegrate on a short time scale , and ( 3 ) the sco - cen space motion varied as one isolated different subsamples within the group , enough so to cast doubt on the derived cluster parallaxes for the constituent stars .",
    "many of the kinematic objections by smart and others were addressed by adriaan @xcite in his phd thesis , which concluded that sco - cen was indeed a true moving group . perhaps blaauw s ( 1946 )",
    "most amusing retort was in telling the regius chair of astronomy at glasgow to simply look up ( p. 19 ) : `` _ smart has not paid attention to the fact that the existence of the cluster is evident from the apparent distribution of the bright stars in the sky .",
    "_ ''    in hindsight , the first objection is understandable as the young stars in the solar neighborhood form from molecular gas which itself has small peculiar motions with respect to the lsr @xcite .",
    "the last two objections are symptomatic of ob associations in general , when compared to the more coherent kinematic groups like the hyades cluster . as one of the few nearby ob associations with appreciable proper motion , the kinematic studies of blaauw , and others , were critical to understanding the dynamical state of ob associations in general .",
    "the modern consensus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that sco - cen constitutes a moving group , but that it has subgroups isolated by position , age , and space motion , and that these structures are young and unbound .",
    "investigations of the expansion of the sco - cen subgroups have been undertaken by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . a modern study using the radial velocities of the low - mass members",
    "is sorely needed to confirm , and build upon , these findings .",
    "the most recent investigation of the membership of high - mass stars in scorpius - centaurus was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they used hipparcos proper motions and parallaxes in conjunction with two moving group methods in order to accurately establish the high - mass ( and sometimes intermediate mass ) stellar content of 12 nearby ob associations . in sco - cen the membership of nearly 8000 hipparcos catalogue stars was investigated .",
    "a total of 120 stars in us , 221 stars in ucl , and 180 stars in lcc were identified as high probability members .",
    "the mean distances of the subgroups , derived from the hipparcos parallaxes , are 145 pc for us , 140  pc for ucl , and 118  pc for lcc .",
    "the vicinity of sco - cen is rich with well - studied sites of current , and recently terminated , star - formation .",
    "besides the ophiuchus and lupus star - forming regions , there are other dark clouds , t associations , and somewhat older `` outlying '' stellar groups which appear to be genetically related to sco - cen by virtue of their ages , positions , and space motions @xcite .",
    "several of these are described elsewhere in this volume .",
    "these neighboring regions demonstrate a broad evolutionary spectrum of star formation .",
    "they include dark clouds with little , if any , star - formation activity ( e.g. musca , coalsack , pipe nebula , cha iii ) , molecular cloud complexes that are currently forming stars ( e.g. cha i & ii , cra ) , and several recently discovered groups of @xmath17  myr - old stars with little or no trace of the dark clouds from which they formed ( e.g. the tw hya , @xmath18 pic , @xmath19 cha , @xmath20 cha groups ) . in an investigation of the origins of the @xmath19 cha cluster , @xcite and @xcite found that many nearby , young groups , and isolated young stars , in the southern hemisphere within @xmath3200pc ( e.g. @xmath19 cha , tw hya , @xmath18 pic , @xmath20 cha , cra , etc . ) are not only spatially close to the sco - cen ob association , but _ moving away from the subgroups_. the star - forming clouds in oph , cra , and cha i manifest head - tail morphologies , with the star - forming `` heads '' on the side facing sco ob2 .",
    "more detailed investigations of the space motions and star - formation histories of the associations in this region are needed , however the preliminary results suggest that star - formation in these small `` satellite '' groups near sco - cen may have been triggered by the massive star - formation event in the primary sco - cen subgroups ( see , e.g.  the comprehensive model scenario for the formation of the sco - cen association and the young stellar groups proposed by * ? ? ?",

    "there is no evidence for ongoing star formation activity in the ob subgroups of sco - cen itself .",
    "this makes it an ideal target for an investigation of the _ outcome of the recently completed star formation process_. the area is essentially free of dense gas and dust clouds , and the association members show only very moderate extinctions ( @xmath22  mag ) .",

    "the consensus from studies of the high mass and low mass populations appears to be that the western `` edge '' of sco - cen lies near galactic longitude 290@xmath28 .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite suggested that an ob association spatially contiguous to lcc might exist to the south in chamaeleon . while there are a total of 4 known b stars associated with the cha i ( 2 ) , @xmath20 cha ( 1 ) , and @xmath19 cha ( 1 ) kinematic groups in chamaeleon",

    "their sample appears to be dominated by field stars completely unrelated to the chamaeleon molecular clouds or sco - cen .",
    "the upper scorpius association is the best studied part of the sco - cen complex . despite its rather young age ( @xmath29  myr ) and the neighborhood to the @xmath30 oph molecular cloud ( see chapter by wilking et al .  in this book ) , which is located in front of the southeastern edge of us and is well known for its strong star formation activity , there are no indications for ongoing star formation in us . below we will make a distinction between the high- and the low - mass stellar population .",
    "the former refers to stars of spectral types f and earlier ( @xmath31 ) whose membership of us was established using hipparcos data @xcite .",
    "the latter refers to g , k , and m stars in the mass range @xmath32  m@xmath33 for which membership was established from their pms character .      investigated the membership of 1215 stars in us listed in the hipparcos catalogue ; 120 of these were identified as genuine members .",

    "the most massive star in us was presumably a @xmath35 o5o6 star , which exploded as a supernova about 1.5  myr ago .",
    "@xcite suggested that the pulsar psr  j1932 + 1059 is the remnant of this supernova and that the runaway star @xmath12 oph was the previous binary companion of the supernova progenitor and was ejected by the explosion .",
    "however , the new parallax of psr  j1932 + 1059 determined by @xcite challenged this scenario .",
    "the new data suggest that the pulsar was probably _ not _ the former binary companion of @xmath12 oph , but it is still possible that psr  j1932 + 1059 was created in us @xmath36  myr ago .",
    "the 120 kinematic members of us cover an area of about 150  deg@xmath37 on the sky .",
    "the large intrinsic size of the association suggests that the spread of individual stellar distances can not be neglected .",
    "the projected diameter on the sky is @xmath38 which at the distance of us corresponds to @xmath39  pc .",
    "however , while the hipparcos data allow the determination of a very accurate mean distance of @xmath40  pc for us @xcite , the errors on the trigonometric parallaxes ( @xmath41 mas ) are too large to resolve the internal spatial structure .",
    "the only conclusion that can be drawn directly from the hipparcos parallaxes is that the line - of - sight depth of us can not be much larger than @xmath42  pc .",
    "this prompted @xcite to carry out a more detailed investigation of the hipparcos members of scorpius - centaurus by performing a careful kinematic modeling of the proper motion and parallax data .",
    "he used a maximum likelihood scheme based on a generalized moving - cluster method to derive secular ( or ` kinematically improved ' ) parallaxes for the association members .",
    "he showed that the method is robust and that the secular parallaxes are a factor of @xmath43 more precise than the hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the secular parallaxes for the members of us show a much reduced line - of - sight dispersion , confirming that the dominant part of the scatter in the hipparcos distances is caused by the trigonometric parallax errors and not by a large intrinsic dispersion of individual stellar distances .",
    "the distribution of secular parallaxes for us is not resolved , which means that the distance spread can not be larger than @xmath44 pc .",
    "hence one can assume that us has a roughly spherical shape , i.e.  that the intrinsic spread of distances is about @xmath45 pc from the mean value of 145 pc .",
    "previous investigations of the imf of us focused on the high- to intermediate mass stellar content . established the membership of stars in us using walraven multi - color photometry , and determined their physical parameters ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , from which they derived stellar masses .",
    "@xcite used the preliminary results on membership from the hipparcos data to determine the luminosity function for the high - mass stars using the hipparcos parallaxes , and then transformed a smoothed version of this into a mass function using the mass - luminosity relation listed in @xcite . adopting a conservative completeness limit of @xmath48 , which corresponds to masses of about @xmath49 , he concluded that down to this mass limit the imf is consistent with a single power - law @xmath50 with slope @xmath51 .",
    "there are , however , several problems with this determination of the imf , most importantly the fact that a mass - luminosity relation had been used that might not be appropriate for young stars ( see discussion in brown 1998 ) .",
    "finally , @xcite attempted to extend the completeness of the kinematic studies of the membership of us toward lower masses by making use of the trc and act astrometric catalogs @xcite , which are believed to be complete to @xmath52 .",
    "he selected some 250 candidate members with @xmath53 from these catalogs by searching for stars with proper motions consistent with those of the hipparcos association members , and which lie @xmath54 mag below and @xmath55 mag above the main sequence in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "however , we note that the second selection criterion actually excludes most of the late - type association members , which , at an age of about 5 myr , lie well above the main sequence .",
    "numerous studies have tried to reveal low - mass stars in us .",
    "most of these , however , focused on very small subregions of the association .",

    "detailed discussions and simulations of these effects can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the net effect of the uncertainties is that in the observed hr diagram a ( hypothetical ) perfectly coeval population of stars will _ not _ populate just a single line ( i.e.  the corresponding isochrone ) , but will always display a finite spread , mimicking an age spread . @xcite and @xcite found via statistical modeling of these effects that the observed hr - diagram for the low - mass stars in us is consistent with the assumption of a _ common stellar age of about 5 myr ; there is no evidence for an age dispersion , although small age spreads of @xmath36  myr can not be excluded by the data_. @xcite showed that the derived age is also robust when taking into account the uncertainties of the theoretical pms models .",
    "the mean age of 5  myr and the absence of a significant age spread among the us stars has been confirmed in the independent studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the age derived for the low - mass stars is very well consistent with previous independent age determinations based on the nuclear and kinematic ages of the massive stars @xcite , which also yielded 5 myr .",
    "this very good agreement of the _ independent _ age determinations for the high - mass and the low - mass stellar population shows that _ low- and high - mass stars are coeval _ and thus have formed together .",
    "furthermore , the absence of a significant age dispersion implies that all stars in the association have formed more or less simultaneously .",
    "this means that the star - formation process must have started rather suddenly and everywhere at the same time in the association , and also must have ended rather suddenly after at most a few myr . the star formation process in us",
    "can thus be considered as a _ burst of star formation_. this will be discussed in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sf_in_usco ]      upper scorpius is an ideal target for an investigation of the initial mass function ( imf ) for several reasons .",
    "first , the star formation process is completed and thus stars of all masses are already present ; since the molecular cloud has already been dispersed , the members are also rather easily observable .",

    "there is no evidence for a significant age spread , and the data are consistent with the idea that all stars have formed within a period of no more than @xmath123 myr .",

    "showed that the internal 1d velocity dispersion of the hipparcos members of us is only 1.3  km / s . in combination with the well determined age of us and the present - day size",
    ", this strikingly small velocity dispersion clearly shows that us can not have originated in a compact cluster configuration that expanded later , but must have been in a spatially extended configuration from the beginning .",
    "us seems to have formed in an extended , unbound giant molecular cloud , similar to the models considered by @xcite .",
    "the initial size of the association can be estimated by assuming that the stars expanded freely from their initial positions . with a gaussian velocity distribution characterized by the measured velocity dispersion , a single point in space",
    "would have expanded to a size of about 13  pc in 5  myr .",
    "subtracting this number from the current characteristic size of 28  pc in quadrature leads to an initial size of 25  pc .",
    "this implies an lateral stellar crossing time of 25  pc  /  1.3  km / s @xmath3  20  myr in the initial configuration .",
    "this large crossing time is in remarkable contrast to the upper limit on any possible age spread among the association members of only @xmath123 myr .",
    "the fact that the lateral stellar crossing time is much ( about an order of magnitude ) larger than the age spread of the association members clearly suggests that some external agent must have coordinated the onset of the star formation process over the full spatial extent of the association . in order to account for the small spread of stellar ages ,",
    "the triggering agent must have crossed the initial cloud with a velocity of at least @xmath124 km / s .",
    "also , some mechanism must have terminated the star formation process about 1 myr after it started .",
    "finally , we note that the us region does no longer contain significant amounts of molecular cloud material . the original molecular cloud ,",

    "see sect .",
    "[ us_imf ] ) suggests that only a small fraction of the initial cloud mass was transformed into stars .",
    "these findings can be understood as consequences of the feedback from massive stars .",
    "high - mass stars , above about ten solar masses , profoundly affect their environment in several ways .",
    "their strong ionizing radiation can photoevaporate molecular cloud clumps ( e.g.  see hester et al .",
    "1996 and mccaughrean & andersen 2002 for the case of m16 ) and circumstellar matter around young stellar objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their powerful stellar winds deposit considerable amounts of momentum and kinetic energy into the surrounding medium .",
    "finally , supernova explosions cause strong shock waves that transfer typically some @xmath127  erg of kinetic energy into the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "the supernova blast wave will initially expand within the wind - blown bubble formed by the supernova progenitor ; as it catches up with the bubble shock front , it will accelerate the expansion of the bubble ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further disrupt the parental molecular cloud ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sweep up a massive shell of dust and gas .    in general , massive stars have a very destructive effect on their nearby environment ; they can disrupt molecular clouds very quickly and therefore prevent further star formation in their surroundings . at somewhat larger distances , however , the wind- and supernova - driven shock waves originating from massive stars can have a constructive rather than destructive effect by driving molecular cloud cores into collapse .",
    "several recent numerical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found that the outcome of the impact of a shock wave on a cloud core mainly depends on the type of the shock and its velocity : in its initial , adiabatic phase , the shock wave is likely to destroy ambient clouds ; the later , isothermal phase , however , is capable of triggering cloud collapse if the velocity is in the right range .",
    "shocks traveling faster than about 50 km / s shred cloud cores to pieces , while shocks with velocities slower than about 15 km / s usually cause only a slight temporary compression of cloud cores .",
    "shock waves with velocities in the range of @xmath128 km / s , however , seem to be well able to induce collapse of molecular cloud cores .",
    "a good source of shock waves with velocities in that range are expanding superbubbles driven by the winds and supernova explosions of massive stars at distances between @xmath124  pc and @xmath129  pc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "observational evidence for star forming events triggered by shock waves from massive stars has , for example , been discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; see also the discussions in @xcite and @xcite .      for the star burst in us , a very suitable trigger is the shock - wave of the expanding superbubble around the ucl group , which is driven by the winds of the massive stars and several supernova explosions that started to occur about 12 myr ago .",
    "the structure and kinematics of the large h  i loops surrounding the scorpius - centaurus association suggest that this shock wave passed through the former us molecular cloud just about 5 myr ago @xcite .",
    "this point in time agrees very well with the ages found for the low - mass stars as well as the high - mass stars in us .",
    "furthermore , since the distance from ucl to us is about 60  pc , this shock wave probably had just about the right velocity ( @xmath130  km / s ) that is required to induce star formation according to the modeling results mentioned above .",
    "thus , the assumption that this wind- and supernova - driven shock wave triggered the star formation process in us provides a self - consistent explanation of all observational data .",
    "+      a scenario for the star formation history of us consistent with the observational results described above is shown in fig .",
    "[ sfm ] . the shock - wave crossing us",
    "about 5  myr ago initiated the formation of some 2500 stars , including 10 massive stars upwards of @xmath131 .",
    "when the new - born massive stars ` turned on ' , they immediately started to destroy the cloud from inside by their ionizing radiation and their strong winds .",
    "this affected the cloud so strongly that after a period of @xmath132 myr the star formation process was terminated , probably simply because all the remaining dense cloud material was disrupted .",
    "this explains the narrow age distribution and why only about 3% of the original cloud mass was transformed into stars .",
    "about 1.5 myr ago , the most massive star in us , presumably the progenitor of the pulsar psr  j1932 + 1059 ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , exploded as a supernova and created a strong shock wave , which fully dispersed the us molecular cloud and removed basically all the remaining diffuse material .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that this shock wave must have crossed the @xmath30 oph molecular cloud within the last 1 myr @xcite .",
    "the strong star formation activity we witness right now in the l  1688 cloud of the @xmath30 oph region might therefore be triggered by this shock wave ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and would represent the third generation of sequential triggered star formation in the scorpius - centaurus - ophiuchus complex .",
    "furthermore , we note that the lupus 1 & 2 dark clouds are also located near the edge of the shell around us .",
    "these two dark clouds ( see chapter by comern in this book ) contain numerous young stellar objects with estimated ages of @xmath132  myr ; their recent star formation activity may also well have been triggered by the passage of the shock related to the expanding shell around us ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ an updated model for triggered cloud and star formation : _    while the scenario described above provides a good explanation of the star formation history , a potential problem is its implicit assumption that the us and @xmath30 oph molecular clouds existed for many myr without forming stars before the triggering shock waves arrived ( otherwise one should see large age spreads in the stellar populations , contrary to the observational evidence ) .",
    "numerous recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have provided increasing and convincing evidence that the lifetime of molecular clouds is much shorter than previously thought , and the whole process of molecular cloud formation , star formation , and cloud dispersal ( by the feedback of the newly formed stars ) occurs on timescales of only a few @xmath133 )  myr .",
    "it is now thought that molecular clouds form by the interaction of flows in the interstellar medium that accumulate matter in some regions .",
    "as soon as the column density gets high enough for self - shielding against the ambient uv radiation field , the atomic gas transforms into molecular clouds .",
    "this new paradigm for the formation and lifetime of molecular clouds seems to invalidate the idea of a shock wave that hit a pre - existing molecular cloud and triggered star formation .",
    "nevertheless , the basic scenario for the sequence of processes in sco - cen may still be valid .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , wind and supernova shock waves from massive stars are an important kind of driver for ism flows , and are especially well suited to create _ coherent large - scale flows_. only large - scale flows are able to form large molecular clouds , in which whole ob associations can be born . an updated scenario for sco - cen could be as follows : initially , the winds of the ob stars created a superbubble around ucl .",
    "the interaction of this expanding superbubble with flows in the ambient ism started to sweep up clouds in some places .",
    "when supernovae started to explode in ucl ( note that there were presumably some 6 supernova explosions in ucl up to today ) , these added energy and momentum to the wind - blown superbubble and accelerated its expansion . the accelerated shock wave ( now with @xmath134  km / sec ) crossed a swept - up cloud in the us area , and the increased pressure due to this shock triggered star formation .",
    "this scenario does not only explain the temporal sequence of events in a way consistent with the ages of the stars and the kinematic properties of the observed hi shells .",
    "the following points provide further evidence : ( 1 ) the model ( see fig .  3 in * ?",
    "* ) predicts that stellar groups triggered in swept - up clouds should move away from the trigger source .",
    "a look at the centroid space motions of the sco - cen subgroups @xcite actually shows that us moves nearly radially away from ucl with a velocity of @xmath135  km / sec .",
    "furthermore , ( 2 ) a study by @xcite revealed that several young stellar groups , including the @xmath19  cha cluster , the tw hydra association , and the young stars associated with the cra cloud , move away from ucl at velocities of about 10 km / sec ; tracing their current motions back in time shows that these groups were located near the edge of ucl 12 myr ago ( when the supernova exploded ) .",
    "( 3 ) the model also predicts that molecular clouds are most efficiently created at the intersection of two expanding bubbles .",
    "the lupus  1 cloud , which is located just between us and ucl , seems to be a good example of this process .",
    "its elongated shape is very well consistent with the idea that it was swept up by the interaction of the expanding superbubble around us and the ( post - sn ) superbubble created by the winds of the remaining early b stars in ucl .      in the ucl and lcc subgroups",
    ", @xcite found that the hr diagram positions of the stars in both groups are consistent with 95% of their low - mass star - formation occurring within a @xmath136  myr span .",
    "the _ upper limit _ on the duration of star - formation is relatively large due to the fact that most of the stars from the @xcite survey were on the radiative portion of the pms evolutionary tracks ( where the isochrones are packed closely together ) , and the binarity of these stars is unstudied .",
    "although @xcite did account for the spread in distances of the subgroup members by using cluster parallaxes , the previously mentioned effects conspire to make it difficult to be more precise about the group star - formation history at this time .",
    "the mean ages of the pms populations , using the @xcite tracks ( 16 myr for ucl , 18 myr for lcc ) , and other sets of models ( 15 - 22 myr for ucl , 17 - 23 myr for lcc ; * ? ? ?",

    "we note two age trends in lcc that are worthy of future investigation .",
    "first , there appears to be a mass - dependence on the derived age for lcc .",
    "the turn - off age for the b - stars is @xmath316 myr ( but see discussion in mamajek et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the median ages of the cool members listed in table 4 are 17 myr for the f stars , 17 myr for the g stars , 12 myr for the k stars , and 4 myr for the m stars .",
    "the 8 m - type members of lcc listed in table 4 all have isochronal ages in the range 2 - 7 myr .",
    "the isochronal age for the m - type members is inconsistent with the positions of the main sequence turn - on ( @xmath3f5 ) and turn - off points ( @xmath3b1 ) .",
    "we do not believe that this is evidence for non - coeval formation for the low mass vs.  high mass stars , but instead attribute the difference to errors with the evolutionary tracks and/or incompleteness of the member sample among the faintest ( i.e.  apparently older ) low - mass members .",
    "there also appears to be a trend in median age vs.  galactic latitude in lcc , which is probably due to substructure .",
    "the median age of the low - mass stars south of the galactic equator is 12@xmath982 myr , while the stars north of the equator have a median age of 17@xmath981 myr .",
    "the observed dispersion in the ages , characterized by the 68% confidence intervals , is @xmath37 myr , however much of this is probably due to observational uncertainties and binarity .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "parallax data for the @xcite members of lcc show that the mean distance to the southern part of the group is closer ( 109@xmath981 pc ) than the northern part ( 123@xmath982 pc ) .",
    "immediately south of lcc at the same distance ( @xmath3110 pc ) is the @xmath20 cha region which formed stars as recently as @xmath33 - 6 myr ago .",
    "could we be seeing evidence for a north - south axis of triggered star - formation ?",

    "@xcite use the _ lack _ of observed eclipses for this equal mass system ( two f5 stars ) , along with the _ hipparcos _ parallax ( @xmath145 = 6.89@xmath981.44mas ) , to constrain the masses of the components ( 1.35@xmath980.07 @xmath146 ) .",
    "the hr - d positions for the ak sco a and b , individually , correspond to ( logt@xmath147 , logl / l@xmath33 = 3.807 , 0.76 ) . using the evolutionary tracks of @xcite ,",
    "this corresponds to an age of 11  myr and 1.5m@xmath33 .",
    "the mass is some 2@xmath57 higher than alencar et al.s dynamic estimate , but still statistically consistent .",
    "all the more remarkable , ak sco demonstrates spectroscopic and photometric evidence for a circumstellar accretion disk .",
    "ak sco , along with pds 66 , appear to be rare examples of stars which can retain accretion disks for @xmath11710myr .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of a low - mass spectroscopic binary , uscoctio  5 ( spectral type m4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in us . the lower limit to the system mass derived from the orbit fit is higher than the mass suggested by pms models based on the luminosity and effective temperature , suggesting either problems of the theoretical pms evolutionary models or uncertainties in the empirical spectral type and/or temperature determination .",
    "another important aspect is how circumstellar disks evolve and whether their evolution is affected by environmental conditions .",
    "some interesting results on the time scales for mass accretion and disk dissipation have been obtained for sco - cen members .",
    "first , it was found that the fraction of accreting stars ( as traced by strong h@xmath34 emission ) is @xmath148 in us @xcite , but @xmath103few% in ucl and lcc @xcite .",
    "a recent _ spitzer _ study by @xcite of us members across the whole stellar mass spectrum has found that circumstellar disk evolution appears to be very mass dependent .",
    "roughly 20% of the @xmath149 ( k / m - type ) members of us were found to have infrared seds consistent with primordial accretion disks , whereas _ none _ of the @xmath150 ( f / g - type ) stars , and only one ( of 61 ) of the massive a / b - type , showed signs of having accretion disks .",
    "a small fraction ( @xmath320% ) of the a / b - type massive stars did show evidence for small excesses at 16@xmath151 m , which could be due to cold , dusty debris disks .",
    "a _ spitzer _",
    "study by @xcite investigated infrared excesses tracing dust at @xmath3  340  au from f / g - type stars from @xcite .",
    "the mips observations of 40 f- and g - type proper motion members of sco - cen detected 14 objects that possess @xmath152 m fluxes @xmath153 larger than their predicted photospheres , tentatively corresponding to a disk fraction of @xmath154 , including seven objects that also possess @xmath155 m excesses @xmath156 times larger than their predicted photospheres .",
    "20% of the targets in us , 9% in ucl , and 46% in lcc display @xmath152 m excesses .",
    "another critical area of stellar evolution theory which studies of sco - cen membership could address is li depletion .",
    "li depletion in low - mass stars is predicted to take place the fastest for stars of mass @xmath30.6m@xmath33 @xcite , which corresponds to spectral type @xmath3m2 for @xmath310 - 20myr - old objects .",
    "only a small sample of early - m - type stars are known in the ucl and lcc subgroups , primarily among the krautter - wichmann and park - finley _ rosat _ tts samples . despite the evidence for a short duration of star - formation in us ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite have recently suggested that the spread in li abundances among the low - mass members of us may be interpreted as evidence for a significant age spread .",
    "a high - resolution spectroscopic study of low - mass sco - cen members may be able to address the following questions : is there a demonstrable spread in li abundances for stars of a given mass ? does the spread correlate with any fundamental parameters ( i.e.  rotation , binarity , etc . ) ?",
    "is there evidence for a spread in ages amongst the low - mass members ?",
    "larger samples of low - mass sco - cen members are sorely needed to address these topics .",
    "if the imf predictions are any indication , then the surface of the census of low - mass sco - cen members has barely been scratched . due to its intermediate age , between that of well - studied t associations and nearby zams clusters , as well as its close proximity , the nearest ob association promises to be an important region for studying star - formation up close , and understanding of the pms evolution of low - mass stars and their circumstellar disks .",
    "the sco - cen region is a promising hunting ground for future ground - based , high - cadence , photometric and astrometric survey facilities ( e.g. , pan - starrs , skymapper ) as well as the gaia astrometric mission . by combining the photometric and astrometric capabilities of these facilities with a focused spectroscopic survey ,",
    "it is possible that we could construct an accurate 7-dimensional picture ( position , velocity , age ) of the complete stellar census of our nearest `` starburst '' within the next decade or two .",
    "we dedicate this review to adriaan blaauw , whose ph.d . thesis 60 years ago , and series of influential papers over the past six decades , laid the foundation for much of our understanding of sco - cen , and the other ob associations .",
    "we are grateful to hans zinnecker and ronnie hoogerwerf for valuable comments on the manuscript , and tim de zeeuw for providing a figure .",
    "eric mamajek is supported by a clay postdoctoral fellowship from the smithsonian astrophysical observatory .",
    "thomas preibisch would like to thank hans zinnecker for many years of motivation and advice in studying upper scorpius .",
    "this work made extensive use of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services and the simbad database ( cds , strasbourg , france ) .",

    "<S> we summarize observational results on the stellar population and star formation history of the scorpius - centaurus ob association ( sco ob2 ) , the nearest region of recent massive star formation . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of three subgroups , upper scorpius ( us ) , upper centaurus - lupus ( ucl ) , and lower centaurus - crux ( lcc ) which have ages of about 5 , 17 , and @xmath0  myr . </S>",
    "<S> while the high- and intermediate mass association members have been studied for several decades , the low - mass population remained mainly unexplored until rather recently .    in upper scorpius </S>",
    "<S> , numerous studies , in particular large multi - object spectroscopic surveys , have recently revealed hundreds of low - mass association members , including dozens of brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of a large representative sample of association members provided detailed information about the stellar population and the star formation history . the empirical mass function </S>",
    "<S> could be established over the full stellar mass range from @xmath1 up to @xmath2 , and was found to be consistent with recent determinations of the field initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> a narrow range of ages around 5  myr was found for the low - mass stars , the same age as had previously ( and independently ) been derived for the high - mass members . </S>",
    "<S> this supports earlier indications that the star formation process in us was triggered , and agrees with previous conjectures that the triggering event was a supernova- and wind - driven shock - wave originating from the nearby ucl group .    in the older ucl and lcc regions , large numbers of low - mass members </S>",
    "<S> have recently been identified among x - ray and proper - motion selected candidates . in both subgroups , low - mass members have also been serendipitously discovered through investigations of x - ray sources in the vicinity of better known regions ( primarily the lupus and tw hya associations ) . </S>",
    "<S> while both subgroups appear to have mean ages of @xmath316myr , they both show signs of having substructure </S>",
    "<S> . their star - formation histories may be more complex than that of the younger , more compact us group .    </S>",
    "<S> sco - cen is an important `` astrophysics laboratory '' for detailed studies of recently formed stars . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the ages of the sub - groups of 5  myr and @xmath4  myr are ideal for studying how circumstellar disks evolve . </S>",
    "<S> while no more than a few percent of the sco - cen members appear to be accreting from a circumstellar disk , recent _ spitzer _ results suggest that at least @xmath335% still have cold , dusty , debris disks . </S>"
