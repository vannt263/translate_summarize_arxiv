    "the recent discovery of a classification@xcite for various topological insulators and superconductors@xcite relies on discrete symmetries of the non - interacting fermions .",
    "for example , band insulators respecting time - reversal symmetry can be classified in two and three spatial dimensions . in both cases",
    "there are two distinct classes of band insulators which can not be smoothly connected to each other . for the non - trivial phase of time - reversal symmetric insulators in three dimensions@xcite , gapless states of dirac fermions emerge on its surface .",
    "the gaplessness is protected as long as the time - reversal symmetry is respected at the boundary and the bulk gap remains finite .",
    "this is very different from the physics of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe)@xcite , which is one of the most well - understood and rich examples of topological order@xcite . on the edge of a fractional quantum hall state",
    ", there is a gapless chiral luttinger liquid@xcite which can never be gapped out simply because the net chirality of the bulk state prevents some modes from disappearing .",
    "there is no reference to symmetry needed to explain the stability of the edge states in fqhe .",
    "moreover , the topological order of the fqhe is intimately connected to the gapless edge state@xcite .",
    "the connection between the topological bulk theory and the edge theory is easily understood from effective chern - simon theory@xcite of the fqhe . in this effective theory description , the edge degree of freedom",
    "is encoded in the gauge invariance of the chern - simons theory with an open boundary .",
    "however , z2 spin liquids , which are also one of the well - established examples of topological order , do not have gapless edge states in general .",
    "the effective @xmath0 theory@xcite description of z2 spin liquid _ does _ have an edge degree of freedom as in the chern - simons theory : the edge theory is a pair of chiral fermions propagating in opposite directions . in the absence of any symmetry , these two fermion modes can backscatter to open up a gap@xcite in contrast to the  chiral \" chern - simons theory of fqhes .",
    "this is true as far as no symmetry is imposed and can be generalized to any ` doubled ' theory@xcite .",
    "however , it is known that the edge theory of the abelian ` doubled ' theory can be gapless@xcite when @xmath1-charge conservation and time - reversal symmetry are present .",
    "the physical example of this is the fractional ( and integer ) quantum spin hall effect@xcite . as an abelian ` doubled ' theory can be re - written formally as the @xmath0 theory ( at the level of the lagrangian ) and a z2 spin liquid is described by @xmath0 theory , one might think that the edge theory of z2 spin liquids can be also gapless if the time - reversal symmetry is imposed .",
    "this is , in fact , incorrect for z2 spin liquids .",
    "the reason why z2 spin liquids fail to have a gapless edge state is traced back to the differences in the charge lattice of the compact gauge theory ( or equivalently , the differences in the allowed operators of the edge theory due to quantization ) .",
    "we will see that the @xmath2 conservation of charge and vortices in z2 spin liquids is crucial .",
    "we will expose this ` structural ' difference of the formally identical theories in the subsequent discussion in this paper .",
    "nonetheless , the understanding of the gapless edge states of the fractional spin hall effect indicates that the doubled theories can have gapless edge states .",
    "thus , it implies that z2 spin liquids will have gapless edge states if the correct symmetries are imposed on top of the topological order . in this paper",
    ", we will show that translational symmetry can stabilize the gaplessness of z2 spin liquids in certain cases .",
    "we make a direct connection between the microscopic structure of the physics and the effective @xmath0 theory to confirm the gaplessness of the edge states .",
    "another motivation of this paper is to study the effect of the translational symmetry@xcite on the so - called  _ intrinsic topological order _ \" .",
    "the intrinsic topological orders in gapped phases are featured by long - range entanglement@xcite , fractional excitations@xcite , and topological degeneracies@xcite .",
    "examples of intrinsic topological orders are the fractional quantum hall effect states@xcite and gapped quantum spin liquids@xcite .",
    "intrinsic topological orders are stable against _ any _ weak perturbations in the presence of no symmetry , to compare with ",
    "_ symmetry - protected topological order _ \" .",
    "the symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) phases@xcite include topological insulators and topological superconductors@xcite as its outstanding examples .",
    "one spt phase is a gapped phase with no fractional excitations and no topological degeneracy , which has gapless boundary states protected by symmetry .",
    "most importantly , a gapped spt phase can be _ continuously _ connected to the trivial phase if the symmetry is broken@xcite .",
    "a natural question is : what kind of role does symmetry play for intrinsic topological orders ?",
    "it turns out that different _ _ symmetry enriched topological ( srt ) phases__@xcite can emerge from the same intrinsic topological order , such as different classes of fractional topological insulators@xcite with @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "therefore fractional topological insulators@xcite and other srt phases exhibit interesting interplay of fractionalization and symmetry . here",
    ", we show that by imposing translational symmetry new physics emerges in z2 spin liquids such as gapless edge states and the majorana zero modes at the lattice dislocations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ general discussion ] , we will study the general edge theory of z2 spin liquids and show that the edge theory is generally gapped when there is no symmetry imposed on top of the @xmath4 topological order .",
    "we also compare the edge theory of z2 spin liquids to the edge theory of the quantum spin hall insulator . in section iii , we impose translational symmetry on z2 spin liquids .",
    "we reveal the structure of wen s plaquette model , which has a gapless edge state , and generalize it to construct mean - field hamiltonian of z2 spin liquids with gapless edge states .",
    "we also study the edge theory in detail , including the condition for the existence of the gapless edge states and its stability . in section iv",
    ", we encode the lattice translational symmetry into the @xmath0 theory and make a connection between @xmath0 theories and the z2 spin liquids found in section iii .",
    "we present a generalization to a three - dimensional model in section v , then summarize our results and raise open questions in section vi .",
    "in z2 spin liquids , there are two low - energy excitations , namely the spinon and the vison . spinons ( visons ) carry electric charge @xmath5 ( magnetic charge @xmath6 ) in the underlying @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "they can be described by @xmath0 theory with the charge lattice @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the electric current @xmath9 and magnetic current @xmath10 which couple to @xmath11 and @xmath12 minimally .",
    "then , the low - energy theory for the @xmath4 spin liquid@xcite is l = ^ a _ _ b _ - a_j^ - b_j^ + o(a , b)^2 .",
    "[ bf ] as noted before , a formally similar @xmath0 theory emerges as the effective theory for the spin hall effect with a kramer pair of counter - propagating gapless edge modes . to manifest this similarity , we diagonalize the @xmath0 lagrangian into two copies of chern - simon theory , i.e. , we write @xmath13 and @xmath14 to obtain l = ^a__a _ - ^b__b _ - a -b , [ dcs ] where the dot product ( @xmath15 ) are understood .",
    "we introduced the source currents @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the charge lattice associated with @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "can be deduced from that of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( i.e. , of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "we begin with @xmath26 where @xmath24 is defined modular @xmath27 . for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 . for @xmath5 and @xmath29 , @xmath31 . for @xmath32 mod @xmath27 and @xmath29 , @xmath33 .",
    "similar consideration shows that @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in the diagonalized doubled chern - simon theory , @xmath35 is the same as @xmath36 in @xmath0 theory .",
    "now , we construct the edge theory from eq .. l_edge = ^_r(_t - v_x)_r + ^_l(_t+v_x)_l [ edge ] this edge theory , in general , is unstable to opening up a gap@xcite .",
    "this can be easily seen from @xmath2 conservation of spinons and visons .",
    "the @xmath2 gauge charge conservation allows us to add the mass term @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this is because @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or @xmath38 carry charges @xmath41 which are equivalent to no charge @xmath30 in @xmath2 theory .",
    "hence , we conclude that there is no protected edge state for a general z2 spin liquid without additional symmetries , independent of microscopic constructions .",
    "however , this could be changed when the z2 spin liquid is supplemented by a symmetry .",
    "additional symmetries on the topological order can restrict the form of the mass terms and stabilize the gapless edge state .",
    "we now show that the time - reversal symmetry can not stabilize the ` gaplessness ' of the edge states of z2 spin liquids ( if it does not possess any ` strong index'@xcite for the underlying fermionic spinons ) .",
    "we take the edge theory eq . and consider the time - reversal symmetry operation on the @xmath18 and @xmath19 . due to the fact that under time reveral @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( with the definition @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) under the time - reversal operation @xmath48 , the time - reversal operation effectively acts as the exchange of two fermionic fields , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 up to the @xmath1 phase factor @xmath51 .",
    "we can take @xmath52 or @xmath53 to be consistent with the time - reversal operation @xmath54 or @xmath55 , where @xmath56 represents the total fermion number operator .",
    "this operation should be supplemented with @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the kinetic term for the edge theory eq . is time - reversal symmetric .",
    "we discuss the two different cases @xmath55 and @xmath54 independently .",
    "first , for @xmath55 the time - reversal symmetry allows mass terms of the form @xmath58 , with an equal amplitude for @xmath59 , which are capable of gapping the edge .",
    "other terms such as @xmath60 are not allowed . as a whole ,",
    "the time reversal symmetric edge theory for z2 spin liquid is l = l_edge ( _ r , _ l ) + m ( _ r^_l + _",
    "l^_r ) + h.c . , where @xmath61 is the kinetic term eq .. for @xmath54 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are not allowed . instead , there are allowed terms such as @xmath60 , and they are enough to gap out the edge state . here",
    "we assumed that there are no strong indices for the underlying spinons .",
    "the strong index includes the @xmath2-indices for diii class and @xmath62- indices for c / d classes@xcite for band structures of the schwinger fermions@xcite ( fermionic spinons ) .",
    "when the strong index of the time - reversal symmetry is nontrivial , then this phase automatically has the gapless edge state which is either a pair of helical majorana modes ( diii class ) or chiral majorana modes ( c or d classes ) .",
    "however , these phases are not described by @xmath0 theory chern - simons theory . in the case of class d and diii ,",
    "the corresponding spin liquids host non - abelian quasiparticle excitations which could in general be described by non - abelian chern - simons theory . ] and will not be discussed in this work .    for the quantum spin hall effect on the other hand , we have @xmath1 charge conservation and the time - reversal symmetry @xmath48 with @xmath54 .",
    "the two conditions exclude@xcite the two mass terms @xmath39 , @xmath60 which _ were _ allowed in @xmath2 theory . hence , the edge excitations of the quantum spin hall state are gapless , in contrast to that of z2 spin liquids .    in the remaining sections of this paper",
    ", we will consider the effects of the translational symmetries on the states localized at the edges of z2 spin liquids .",
    "we find that translational symmetry can stabilize the gapless modes at the edges of some z2 spin liquids .",
    "wen s plaquette model@xcite is an exactly solvable model on the square lattice where the spin degrees of freedom are fractionalized into majorana fermions . the model can be formulated as the pure @xmath2 gauge theory@xcite h = -g _ p f_p = -g _ p _ < ij > p u_ij , [ wen ] where @xmath64 denotes a plaquette of the direct lattice . here",
    ", @xmath65 is the @xmath2 gauge field on the link @xmath66 , and thus @xmath67 is the field strength on the plaquette @xmath64 . a faithful representation of this gauge theory is @xmath68 , @xmath69 with translational symmetry .",
    "there are four majorana fermions @xmath70 per site , and the dimension of the hilbert space per site is @xmath71 states per site ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . to faithfully represent a spin-1/2 system , we need to halve this hilbert space , i.e. , the hilbert space per site should have dimension @xmath27 .",
    "this is done by taking the @xmath2 redundancy into account : the theory eq .",
    "is invariant under @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the model can be more clearly represented if we introduce two complex fermions f_i , u = _ i , x + i_i , x , f^_i , d = _ i , y + i_i , y , [ parton ] such that the spin @xmath74 on the site @xmath75 is represented via @xmath76",
    ". then , the hamiltonian eq . reduces to h = -g _ p s_i ,",
    "xs_i+x , ys_i+x + y , xs_i+ , y. from the model eq . , we can immediately see the existence of the edge degree of freedom . as the majorana fermions in bulk",
    "will be paired within the plaquette , there will be dangling majorana fermions@xcite at the boundary because of the edge cuts a plaquette in half ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "it was already noticed@xcite that this model ( with @xmath77 ) has a flat band of edge states on the boundary along @xmath78- and @xmath79- directional cut ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "hence , to look for gapless edge states for z2 spin liquids protected by translational symmetry , we can consider similar models which supports dangling majorana fermions on the edge .",
    "we will generalize the structure of wen s model to generate a series of mean - field hamiltonian for z2 spin liquids with gapless boundary states in two and three spatial dimensions .",
    "we also discuss the stability of the gapless boundary states .",
    "we now look into wen s model carefully . to illuminate the underlying structure of wen s model , we study the mean - field hamiltonian for the fermionic spinons .",
    "h_mean ( \\{f_i , u , f_i , d } ) = _ ij + h.c .",
    "we notice , by plugging eq .",
    ", that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are decoupled completely and form the one - dimensional majorana fermion chains@xcite ( in the weak - pairing phase ) along @xmath78- and @xmath79- axis",
    ". explicitly , we now have h_mean ( \\{f_i , u , f_i , d } ) = h_1d , x ( \\{f_i , u } ) + h_1d , y ( \\{f_i , d } ) , [ kitaev ] where @xmath82 is the one - dimensional kitaev model along @xmath83 in the weak pairing regime .",
    "this explains why we have dangling majorana fermions on the boundary along @xmath78- and @xmath79- directional cut of the lattice ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we will see that there is a gapless majorana mode formed by the dangling majorana fermions as long as there are odd number of majorana fermions per unit cell on the edge . before discussing the nature of the gapless edge states ,",
    "we notice that we can easily generalize wen s model by deforming one of @xmath84 eq . into the trivial phase while keeping the constraint ` one spinon per site ' .",
    "then , this z2 spin liquid will break the @xmath85 rotational symmetry of square lattice while keeping the translational symmetry .",
    "for example , let us consider the case where @xmath86 is replaced by the trivial @xmath87 ( this hamiltonian @xmath88 is not necessarily one - dimensional but is fully gapped ) : h_mean ( \\{f_i , u , f_i , d } ) = q(\\{f_i , u } ) + h_1d , y ( \\{f_i , d } ) has dangling majorana fermions if the edge is not parallel to @xmath79 . similarly , we can generate a z2 spin liquid which has dangling majorana fermions if the edge is not parallel to @xmath78 . for z2a phase@xcite",
    "whose spinon band structure preserves translation symmetry explicitly , we can have another possible z2 spin liquid where we align the kitaev chain along @xmath89 ( we will see later that this state has the same characteristics to the wen s model ) .",
    "hence we have three translational symmetric z2a spin liquids with the gapless edge states .",
    "though these z2a spin liquids have the same @xmath2 topological order and the same translational symmetry , we can distinguish them further by looking into the crystal momenta@xcite of the ground states and degeneracies , and the edge states . in the next section , we use these crystal momenta and degeneracies to find the effective @xmath0 theory for the z2 spin liquids .    .",
    "a plaquette operator pairs up four majorana fermions around the square . here , blue circles represent four majorana fermions per site , and red lines connecting two blue circles represent @xmath90 appearing in the plaquette operator .",
    "( b ) in terms of the complex fermions @xmath91 in eq .",
    ", wen s plaquette model can be understood as the stacked one - dimensional kitaev chains parallel to @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "( c ) edge states of wen s model where the edge is along @xmath79 direction .",
    "the plaquette operators in hamiltonian eq .",
    "cover all the majorana fermions except a _",
    "majorana fermion per site on the edge .",
    "the blue circles represent dangling majorana fermions while red circles are majorana fermions covered by the plaquette operators .",
    "these blue dangling modes will hop around by the magnitude @xmath92 when we are away from the exactly solvable point .",
    "( d ) the dangling majorana fermions can be equally well understood via the stacked kitaev chain picture .",
    "when the kitaev chain is cut , the edge always hosts a single majorana fermion per chain .",
    "it is clear that the edge states of ( c ) and ( d ) are exactly the same . ]",
    "now that we have some conditions for the existence of the edge states , we study their detailed features .",
    "we first discuss the relation between the edge degrees of freedom and the bulk gap .",
    "we argue that there is a gapless edge state as long as the bulk is gapped and the translational invariance at the edge remains unbroken ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) . to remove the boundary majorana fermions",
    ", we need to pair them up into complex fermions . due to the translational symmetry",
    ", a majorana fermion on the boundary can not pair up on the boundary if there is one single majorana fermion per unit cell .",
    "what the majorana fermion can do , instead of dimerizing on the boundary , is to tunnel through the bulk and pair - annhilate with the majorana fermion on the opposite boundary .",
    "however , the tunneling length@xcite is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the bulk gap .",
    "hence , we need to close the gap and go through the bulk phase transition to lose the dangling majorana fermions at the boundary . in the next section",
    ", we will construct the effective @xmath0 theory for these phases , and the effective theory should describe a finite range of the phase diagram as it is gapped and the edge state of the topological field theory is stable as long as the gap remains finite .",
    "the above ` gaplessness ' of the edge states depends on the number of majorana fermions per unit cell on the boundary . if there are even numbers of the dangling majorana fermions per unit cell , then majorana fermions can pair up on the boundary without breaking the translational symmetry along the boundary .",
    "the ` parity ' of the number of the dangling majorana fermions on the arbitrary boundary can be easily computed , and there is an odd number@xcite of the dangling majorana fermions per unit cell on the boundary if j_n = = 2 , [ counting ] where @xmath83 is the vector defined for the hamiltonian of the majorana fermion chain @xmath84 , and @xmath95 is the reciprocal vector orthogonal to the boundary . if there is more than one chain , we simply add up all @xmath96 mod @xmath97 .",
    "then we have gapless edge modes protected by the translational symmetry if the sum is @xmath98 mod @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , the same index is used to study the localized states at the dislocations of weak topological insulators / superconductors@xcite . intuitively , @xmath99 in eq .",
    "can be thought as the `` flux density '' of kitaev chains ( which are parelle to @xmath83 ) passing through the area perpendicular to @xmath95 ( which is analogous to the definition of the flux through a surface in the elementary calculus , i.e. , @xmath100 defines the flux of the vector field @xmath101 passing through the area perpendicular to the vector @xmath102 ) . due to the ` parity ' ( or even / odd - ness ) of the dangling majorana fermions , we need to take mod by @xmath97 with the appropriate normalization . to demonstrate this",
    ", we work out a few examples applying eq ..    - _ example 1 . _ edge state of wen s plaquette model with the edge parallel to @xmath79 . as",
    "the edge is along @xmath79-direction , the reciprocal vector defining the edge is @xmath103 . in wen s plaquette model",
    ", we have the two kitaev chains where each chain is identified with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we immediately have @xmath106 and @xmath107 and thus we have a dangling majorana fermion per site because @xmath108 .",
    "this agrees with the previous intuitive understanding depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "- _ example 2 .",
    "_ edge state of wen s plaquette model with the edge parallel to @xmath109 .",
    "this edge can be identified with the reciprocal vector @xmath110 .",
    "as before , we have the two kitaev chains where each chain is identified with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and thus @xmath106 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , i.e. , there are even number of majorana fermions per unit cell at the boundary and hence there is no gapless helical majorana mode protected by the translational symmetry",
    ". indeed , if we look at the edge defined by @xmath110 , there are two majorana fermions ( per unit cell on the boundary ) coming from the kitaev chains along @xmath78- direction and kitaev chains along @xmath79- direction on the boundary which immediately implies that there is no stable gapless edge state .",
    "if we have a single majorana fermion per unit cell , we can study the spectrum of the boundary modes .",
    "when the perturbation away from this ideal hamiltonian is given , the dangling majorana fermions will hybridize with the nearest neighbors and start to disperse h_edge = it _ j _ j_j+1 , where the position of the boundary majorana fermion is labeled by the index @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the effective hopping parameters on the boundary .",
    "the spectrum of this majorana fermion is given by @xmath115 for @xmath116 ( this majorana fermion problem is , in fact , related to the fermion doubling problem ) . to gap out the spectrum ,",
    "we need a perturbation with a matrix element connecting @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "however , this interaction doubles the unit cell on the boundary ( similar to the perturbations required to eliminate the surface of the weak topological insulator@xcite ) , and hence it is prohibited by the lattice translational symmetry .",
    "we note that the right - mover and the left - mover of the gapless edge theory have different center of mass momentum .",
    "this feature is also reproduced by the effective @xmath0 theory .    from this edge spectrum ,",
    "the counting of majorana fermions , and the translational symmetry , we now show that this edge theory mimics the stability of the edge state of a quantum spin hall insulator against the coupling to ordinary one - dimensional luttinger liquids .",
    "when the edge state of the spin hall effect interacts with ordinary luttinger liquids , the edge states are reconstructing themselves to the edge theory of spin hall insulators with the renormalized coefficients .",
    "for the edge of the z2 spin liquids , we can couple our edge theory to the quantum ising chain at the critical point , which is a gapless helical majorana state ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the helical modes ( the left - mover and the right - mover ) of the quantum ising chain are located at @xmath119 . when the helical modes are placed on top of the boundary majorana modes of z2 spin liquids ,",
    "the right - mover at @xmath120 is intact as it can not interact with the modes at @xmath119 . at @xmath119 , there are three modes ( two from the critical ising chain and one from the original qsh edge ) : one right - mover , two left - movers .",
    "the translational - invariant potential will have matrix elements connecting @xmath119 to itself , allowing one right - mover and one left - mover to pair up .",
    "hence , we are left with one left - mover at @xmath119 which is reconstructed from the helical majorana modes of the quantum ising chain and the original left - mover at @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the boundary remains gapless even if it interacts with the critical ising chain .",
    "it is not difficult to see that other systems , such as helical dirac edge , can not gap out the original edge modes as they have even numbers of the helical majorana fermions . the easiest way to understand this behavior is as follows ;",
    "the size of the hilbert space per site in the quantum ising chain is @xmath27 , and we need two majorana fermions per site to represent the hilbert space .",
    "this implies that there are three majorana fermions per unit cell ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) , and thus we expect the spectrum to be gapless after the dimerization of two of them .",
    "hence we can conclude , based on the counting argument and the translational symmetry , that the edge is robust against to coupling to any one - dimensional gapless system .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this edge spectrum implies that we will have a zero energy majorana state at the lattice dislocation in z2 spin liquids@xcite . for wen s plaquette model , the dislocation of the burger s vector @xmath78",
    ", @xmath79 will trap the zero energy majorana states . on the other hand",
    ", we will have the zero energy state of the burger s vector @xmath121 orthogonal to @xmath83 if z2 spin liquids contains a majorana fermion chain along @xmath83 defined above in this section .",
    "the discussion in this section is based on the mean - field hamiltonian for the z2 spin liquids .",
    "however , the spectrum is fully gapped , and hence the fluctuation over mean - field solutions are supposed to be small .",
    "still , one might think that it is unclear if our result remains the same when both four - fermion interactions and gauge fluctuations are included .",
    "these questions , perhaps , can not be answered in the mean - field theory .",
    "therefore we take a different path to answer the question . in the next section",
    ", we will find the effective @xmath0 theory for these spin liquids , and the topological @xmath0 theory should describe a phase instead of a point in the phase diagram .",
    "hence the @xmath0 theory predicts the phase to have gapless edge states on the boundary protected by translational symmetry as long as the gap remains finite .",
    "in this section , we will construct the effective @xmath0 theory of the z2 spin liquids considered in the previous section . in previous studies@xcite",
    "it was shown that the translational symmetry restricts the form of the mass into the specific form so that the edge state becomes gapless .",
    "and the same effective theory captures the crystal momenta of the ground states and topological degeneracies in a square lattice with periodic boundary condition .",
    "here we extend previous results in the way that we clarify the spectrum of the edge theory and its connection to the microscopic model discussed in the previous section ( in fact , the spectrum of the edge states is crucial for the gaplessness as we saw in the microscopic discussion ) .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate the way of classifying @xmath0 theory in the presence of lattice symmetries .",
    "the essence of the effective theory is to encode the non - trivial transformations for the gauge fields in @xmath0 theory under translations ( in the coulomb gauge @xmath122 ) t_x , y : a_i b_i , b_i a_i , leaving the theory eq .",
    "@xmath123 denote lattice translations along @xmath124 and @xmath125 directions .",
    "this directly implies that the edge theory@xcite should be symmetric under @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the edge theory eq .. this symmetry , hence , restricts the form of the masses for the edge theory into l_mass ~a ^_r ( ^_l+ _ l ) + h.c . , [ mass ] to see the effect of this particular mass term eq . , we introduce @xmath128 and @xmath129 where @xmath130 are real majorana fermions . then , the mass eq .",
