    "the starburst nucleus of m83 is a strong x - ray source that was detected in the observations with a luminosity of @xmath28 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "trinchieri et al .",
    "( 1985 ) suggested that the x - ray emission from the nucleus is not dominated by a contribution of massive binary star systems , but is due to a less evolved x - ray emitting population .",
    "they also discussed the possibility that a large fraction of the x - ray emission from the nucleus of m83 could be produced by thermal emission from hot shock - heated gas ejected from the nucleus , as is detected in ngc1068 ( wilson et al .",
    "1992 ) , m82 ( watson et al . 1984 ) and ngc253 ( fabbiano & trinchieri 1984 , fabbiano 1988 , pietsch 1993 ) . a further peculiarity of the nuclear region of m83 is the existence of a polar , circum - nucleus dust lane probably in a plane tilted from the galactic plane by about @xmath29 ( sofue & wakamatsu 1994 ) . reducing the accretion to the nucleus , this ring structure might affect the nuclear star - forming activity .",
    "the ipc observations indicated an x - ray extent comparable in size and shape to that seen in blue light .",
    "this emission component was discussed as probably due to faint individual sources ( evolved stellar population , lmxbs ) , distributed uniformly across the disk of the galaxy ( trinchieri et al .",
    "1985 ) .",
    "ohashi et al . ( 1990 ) observed m83 in the harder x - ray energy band ( 2 - 20 kev ) using the satellite .",
    "the observed spectra are similar to those of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) but significantly softer than those of x - ray pulsars .",
    "the spectra can also be described by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with a temperature of @xmath30 k , suggesting that a major fraction of the x - ray emission may originate from very hot gas . as the time scale for starburst activity",
    "is significantly shorter than the typical lifetime of lmxbs , ohashi et al .",
    "find it unlikely that the high x - ray luminosity of m83 is caused by lmxbs and instead favour the idea that hot gas ( both within and outside of snrs ) produces their observed x - ray spectra .",
    "in this paper we report x - ray observations of m83 carried out with the x - ray telescope ( trmper 1983 , aschenbach 1988 ) position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc , pfeffermann et al .",
    "the foreground galactic x - ray - absorbing gas is distributed smoothly across the optical extent of m83 ( hartmann & burton 1996 ) and has a relatively low column density ( @xmath31 @xmath32 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "hence our observations allow the detection of diffuse soft ( 0.1 - 0.4  kev ) x - ray emission due to hot gas in m83 . in section 2",
    "we give the observational details and data analysis . in section 3",
    "we discuss the different emission components and investigate the interaction of hot gas , galactic winds and magnetic fields .",
    "finally , we compare m83 with other nearby galaxies where diffuse x - ray emission was detected .",
    "the data analysis and reduction was performed using the extended scientific analysis system exsas ( zimmermann et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the field of view of the pspc detector was centered at the pointing position ra @xmath33 , dec @xmath34 ( j2000 ) so that the x - ray emission of m83 was contained well within the innermost 6   from the center .",

    "comparing the x - ray backgrounds in the individual maps , we looked for contamination due to solar and auroral x - ray photons or due to particles of the cosmic background emission ( snowden & freyberg 1993 , snowden et al .",
    "selection of data with low background values ( @xmath35 20 cts per 60 sec interval ) reduced the finally analysed time to 21 ksec but decreased the background noise by @xmath36 .",
    "we looked for positional offsets between x - ray sources in the individual maps and found them to be less than @xmath37 .",
    "systematical shifts between the maps could not be found .",
    "the absolute position of the field depends on the accuracy of the pspc pointing and has been checked comparing point - like x - ray emission features with the positions of stars or extragalactic sources . checking the positions of stars in the hubble space telescope guide star catalog",
    "no identification was obtained . using the extragalactic database ned yielded two identifications :",
    "the x - ray source at ra @xmath38 , dec @xmath39 ( j2000 ) is at the position of the f5v star hr5128 ( sao181825 ) which was already detected in the survey ( schmitt et al .",
    "a second identification may exist for x - ray source 14 ( see table  [ master ] ) and the quasar ms1332.6 - 2935 .",
    "however , the positional uncertainties of these _ rosat_-detected sources are large because of their large off - axis positions ( 290 and 266 , respectively ) . we could identify several x - ray sources in the field of our observations with faint blue stellar objects on  eso quick blue \" plates .",
    "details of source identifications will be given in section [ sources ] .",
    "no systematic positional offsets could be found , and we decided not to apply any  boresight \" corrections for the analysis reported in this paper .      binning the data to a pixelsize of 5   we produced images of the inner 40   region of the pspc detector window .",

    "the smooth profile of the soft , diffuse x - ray emission together with its shallow radial descent argue for the idea that this x - ray emission component is related to a different distribution of emitting sources . from observations of the velocity field ( tilanus & allen 1993 ) and under the assumption of trailing spiral arms",
    ", it follows that the north - western part of the galactic disk is nearer to the observer .",

    "pietsch et al . 1994 ) .",

    "the cooling times are longer than the time scale for starburst activity which is estimated to be around @xmath246 yr ( rieke et al .",
    "1988 , trinchieri et al .",
    "1985 ) .      from x - ray observations of the hot gas it is possible to calculate the thermal energy density of this component of the interstellar medium : @xmath247 .",
    "( it is , however , still not clear whether the ions are in thermal equilibrium with the plasma electrons ( see lesch 1990 ) and how strongly they contribute to @xmath248 ) .",
    "a comparison of the nuclear area and the halo region of m83 ( table  [ gas ] ) shows that @xmath248 is a factor of 6 higher in the nuclear region . here",
    "the gas can escape much more easily from the galactic disk and rise up into the halo , e.g. in the form of a galactic wind channeled by vertical magnetic fields ( breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1994 ) .",
    "high faraday rotation measures and strong depolarization of polarized radio emission in the central part of m83 support this concept ( neininger et al .",
    "1991 , ehle 1995 ) .",
    "further evidence of nuclear gas outflow comes from the detection of absorption lines blueshifted by 1000 km s@xmath1 relatively to the system s velocity ( bohlin et al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "whereas the electron densities of the hot gas ( as derived from the presented x - ray data ) are in general too low to explain the observed depolarization ( see below ) , the density in the nuclear area is relatively high and may contribute to the faraday effects .",
    "a comparison of the polarized radio emission at @xmath249  cm and the broad - band diffuse x - ray emission ( fig .",
    "[ depol ] ) shows indeed a correlation of strong x - ray emission with low polarized intensities in the central area of m83 .",
    "this may indicate that the diffuse x - ray emitting hot gas in the nuclear area depolarizes by the effect of internal faraday dispersion along the line of sight , produced by turbulent magnetic fields and thermal gas inside the emitting source ( burn 1966 , ehle & beck 1993 ) . adopting a strength of the turbulent magnetic field of @xmath250 g ( neininger et al .",
    "1993 ) , a pathlength of @xmath169  kpc ( see above ) and a typical turbulence scale length of 50  pc requires electron densities of @xmath251  @xmath9 to explain the depolarization of @xmath252 at @xmath249  cm in the central region of m83 .",
    "this gas density is comparable , within the range of uncertainties , to that calculated from our x - ray observations ( see table  [ gas ] ) .",
    "the electron densities of thermal gas in the galactic halo required to explain the strong depolarization outside the nuclear area are in the range of @xmath253  @xmath9 ( e.g. ehle 1995 ) .",
    "these values are _ inconsistent _ with the halo densities as derived from our x - ray observations .",
    "either faraday depolarization occurs in cooler ionized gas not radiating in x - rays ( warm absorber ) , or the turbulence scale length in the halo is much larger than in the disk , or the assumption of ionization equilibrium ( raymond - smith plasma with one specific temperature ) is not valid . the latter possibility is supported by the model of galactic winds and delayed recombination ( breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1994 ) . in their simulation",
    "the soft x - ray emission can be explained by a cooler ( typical @xmath254  k ) gas which might have electron densities that are larger by a factor 3 - 5 ( schmutzler , priv .",
    "comm . ) than the values given in table  [ gas ] .    from radio polarization observations it is possible to compare @xmath255 with the energy density of the magnetic field : @xmath256 .",
    "assuming equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields , neininger et al .",
    "( 1993 ) calculated , for a synchrotron emitting disk of @xmath257  kpc thickness , a total magnetic field strength of @xmath258 g for m83 . to scale the disk field strength to that of the halo we use observations of the edge - on galaxy ngc  253 ( beck et al . 1994 ) where the field strength at a height of @xmath259  kpc above the galactic disk is found to be about 80% of the disk value .    allowing the filling factor to vary between 0.1 and 0.8 and including a 0.1 kev uncertainty for the gas temperature",
    ", we obtain a rough estimate of the plasma parameters @xmath260 of @xmath12 both for the nuclear area and for the halo . the galactic wind model ( see above ) leads to an even lower @xmath261 .",
    "although there are other contributions to the total energy density of the hot interstellar medium ( e.g. turbulent motions , cosmic rays ) it is obvious that the magnetic field plays an important role for galactic haloes .",
    "how it might channel galactic winds , support or hinder the escape of hot gas from the galactic disk , or heat the gas via mhd waves or magnetic reconnection is still under discussion .      assuming that most of the mechanical energy supplied to the interstellar gas",
    "is from supernovae , one might ask whether this energy input is high enough to explain the thermal energy of the hot x - ray emitting gas ( cf .",
    "fabbiano et al .",
    "1997 ) . based on an idealized model for the x - ray emission ( a single spherical expanding bubble , cf .",
    "heckman et al . 1996 ) , the supernova rate of m83 ( 0.29 - 0.49  yr@xmath1 ; see below ) might produce a thermal energy of @xmath262  erg integrated over a typical starburst period of @xmath263  yr .",
    "this value is indeed above the thermal energy of the hot gas in the halo region of @xmath264  erg , using the same assumptions for the volume of the emitting halo and the soft - band x - ray luminosity as in sect .",
    "[ discu_extended ] .",
    "this agreement between model and observations supports the hypothesis that the diffuse x - ray emission arises from hot gas originally heated by supernovae .",
    "the luminosity of the diffuse x - ray emission in m83 of @xmath265  erg s@xmath1 in the broad energy band is very high . even if one assumes that only the soft x - ray emission of @xmath266  erg s@xmath1 of the extended and nuclear component originates from a halo above the galactic disk ( sect .",
