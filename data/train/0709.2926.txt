    "we start with an informal description of the model we study in this paper .",
    "particles live in  @xmath4 and evolve in discrete time . at each time",
    ", every particle is substituted by ( possibly more than one ) offspring which are placed in neighboring sites , independently of the other particles .",
    "the rules of offspring generation depend only on the location of the particle .",
    "the collection of those rules ( so - called the _ environment _ ) is itself random , it is chosen randomly before starting the process , and then it is kept fixed during all the subsequent evolution of the particle system .",
    "this model considered in this paper was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the random environment here affects both branching and transition mechanisms , and ( as opposed to the models of  @xcite ) the _ immediate _ descendants of a particle are not supposed to be independent . in  @xcite we proved a dichotomy for recurrence / transience , depending only on the support of the environmental law , and we gave sufficient conditions for recurrence and transience .",
    "in the recurrent case , the tails of the hitting times are studied and a shape theorem is obtained in a preliminary form . the recurrence / transience classification was later completed in  @xcite .",
    "we refer also to @xcite for other work related to branching random walks in random environment .",
    "now , let us look at the subject of this paper from a different angle .",
    "for @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be the transition probabilities from @xmath7 to its nearest neighbors , and @xmath8 .",
    "consistently with the notation introduced later in this section , we denote by @xmath9 the collection of coefficients @xmath10 ( as explained below , @xmath11 stands for the mean offspring in  @xmath7 ) , and by  @xmath12 the corresponding discrete markov operator , @xmath13.\\ ] ] in this paper we will study for @xmath14 the solution @xmath15 of the equation @xmath16 it is easily checked , for instance by the discrete feynman - kac formula , that the solution @xmath17 is given by the expectation @xmath18 of the number @xmath19 of particles in  @xmath20 at time  @xmath21 in a discrete - time branching random walk  starting from a single individual located at site @xmath7 at time 0 .",
    "the evolution rule of this branching random walk is that particles at  @xmath7 branch with an average of  @xmath11 children which then move independently to a neighboring site randomly chosen from @xmath6",
    ". we will be interested in the case where the coefficients  @xmath22 are given by a stationary and finitely dependent random field .",
    "the model has other possible formulations . in the case of continuous time",
    ", the above equation becomes the parabolic partial differential equation @xmath23 with @xmath24 the branching rate . in our case",
    "the mean number of offspring is greater than or equal to  @xmath25 and bounded from above , or , equivalently , @xmath24 is nonnegative and bounded .    in the case where @xmath6 are the simple random walk transition probabilities @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 is the standard laplace operator , this equation is known as the parabolic anderson problem , and has also continuous - space versions , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "these models have motivated a huge scientific activity , with particular interest on localization and intermittency ( e.g.  @xcite ) and survival analysis  @xcite , leading to fine pictures in the different cases of bounded or unbounded  @xmath28 s .",
    "we stress that the markov operator  @xmath12 is random in the present paper , a case that seems not to have been studied so far .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 is non symmetric , this makes the model non - reversible with a possibly large drift , and prevents the use of a spectral theory as in the above references .",
    "the present paper represents a step towards the understanding of the equation  ( [ eq : discrete_anderson ] ) .",
    "we will prove that the solution @xmath17 behaves like @xmath29 as @xmath30 ( see remark  [ rem_complete_shape ] where we comment on the function  @xmath31 ) .",
    "we will even get into the finer study of the population size @xmath32 itself , and we prove the same asymptotics under the assumption that particles can not die .",
    "hence , the growth of the population is rather smooth at the coarse scale @xmath33 . the occurrence of shape theorems and local growth rate goes back at least to @xcite and @xcite for branching random walks , and to @xcite in random environment .",
    "in fact , our model is slightly more general than described above . as mentioned in the beginning of this section",
    ", the branching and the displacement may be dependent . also , the environment that we consider is not necessarily independent , but we allow for a finite range dependence .",
    "we believe that the results extend to more general dependence , but considering this case would require an important additional technical work .    * the model .",
    "* we now describe the model , keeping the notations of  @xcite whenever possible .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35-s be the coordinate vectors of @xmath4 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath36 for @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) . define the distance between two sets @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) by @xmath41 fix a finite set @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for all @xmath44 . define @xmath45 and for @xmath46 put @xmath47 ; note that @xmath48 for all @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , let  @xmath49 be the set of all probability measures  @xmath50 on @xmath51 : @xmath52 then , suppose that @xmath53 is a stationary ergodic random field , and denote by @xmath54 the probability and expectation with respect to  @xmath22 . throughout this paper",
    "we suppose that this field is also _ finitely dependent _ , that is , the following condition holds :    * condition i. * there exists a positive number @xmath55 such that for any two sets @xmath40 with @xmath56 the following holds : the sigma - algebra generated by @xmath57 is independent under @xmath58 from the sigma - algebra generated by @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 corresponds to the case of independent identically distributed environment .",
    "the collection @xmath61 is called _",
    "the environment_. given the environment  @xmath22 , the evolution of the process is described in the following way : start with one particle at some fixed site of  @xmath4 . at each integer time",
    "the particles branch independently using the following mechanism : for a particle at site @xmath38 , a random element @xmath62 is chosen with probability @xmath63 , and then the particle is substituted by @xmath64 particles in @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "note that the population never gets extinct , since every individual has at least one direct descendant .    for the process starting from one particle at  @xmath7 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath67 the number of particles in  @xmath68 at time  @xmath21 .",
    "define the random variable @xmath69 i.e. , @xmath70 is the total number of particles at moment  @xmath21 for the process starting from  @xmath7 .",
    "we denote by @xmath71 the ( so - called  quenched \" ) probability and expectation for the process starting from  @xmath7 in the fixed environment  @xmath22 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath72 = { { \\mathbb e}}\\,{{\\mathtt p}_{\\omega}}^x[\\,\\cdot\\,]$ ] for the annealed law of the branching random walk in random environment , and @xmath73 for the corresponding expectation .",
    "also , sometimes we use the symbols @xmath74 without the corresponding superscripts when it can create no confusion ( e.g.  when the starting point of the process is indicated elsewhere ) .    throughout this paper , and often without recalling it explicitly , we suppose that the two conditions below are fulfilled :    * condition b. * @xmath75>0.\\ ] ]    * condition ue . * for some @xmath76 , @xmath77 = 1.\\ ] ] condition b ensures that the model can not be reduced to random walk without branching , and condition  ue is a natural uniform ellipticity condition which ensures that the walk is really @xmath0-dimensional . in this paper",
    ", the weaker ellipticity condition  e of  @xcite will usually not be enough for our purposes .",
    "in fact , we believe that most of our results do not generally hold if one only assumes condition  e.    for technical reasons we need also the following two conditions :    * condition d. * there exists a positive constant  @xmath78 such that the expectation of the total number of the immediate descendants of any particle is at most  @xmath78 , i.e. , @xmath79=1 $ ] .",
    "* condition a. * there exist @xmath80 with @xmath81 even and @xmath82 such that @xmath83>0 $ ] .",
    "we refer to condition  a as the `` aperiodicity condition '' because , without it , the process starting from the origin would live on even sites at even times , and on odd sites at odd times .",
    "if ( with @xmath84 of condition  a ) a site  @xmath68 is such that @xmath85 , we say that this site is an _",
    "aperiodic _ site , and when",
    "@xmath86 , we say that this site is @xmath87-aperiodic .",
    "we briefly mention that suitably adjusted versions of all our results are also true without condition  a ; the proofs are either the same or even simpler , since we do not have to care about searching for the aperiodic sites , e.g.  the proofs of theorems  [ t_shape_reach ] and  [ t_complete_shape ] .",
    "[ rem : usuel ] a particular case of the model considered here is the usual construction of the branching random walk , that was already mentioned in the beginning of this paper : for each  @xmath7 , specify the transition probabilities @xmath88 , @xmath66 , and branching probabilities @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "a particle in  @xmath7 is first substituted by  @xmath91 particles with probability @xmath89 , then each of the offspring jumps independently to  @xmath65 with probability @xmath88 .",

    "the following result is a consequence of propositions  1.2 , 1.3 , and theorem  1.6 of  @xcite , and also theorem  3.2 of  @xcite ; in section  [ s_ind_rw ] , we comment about the validity of  ( i ) and  ( ii ) below in the non - i.i.d .",

    "it is interesting to observe that , in the case of an i.i.d",
    ".   environment , one has a simple explicit criterion of transience / recurrence for the branching random walk in random environment ; however , for the many - dimensional random walk _ without branching _ in random environment the problem of finding such a criterion is still far from being solved . in",
    "@xcite one can find more evidence that branching makes random walks in random environment `` simpler '' ; see , for instance , the results about the tails of first hitting times .",
    "now , we are ready to formulate the main results of this paper . in what follows , for any @xmath103",
    ", @xmath104 is the closure of  @xmath105 , and  @xmath106 is the interior of  @xmath105 .",

    "next , we characterize the ( quenched ) mean local number of particles .",
    "[ t_local_size ] there exists a convex downwards , continuous function @xmath113 such that for any closed @xmath114 @xmath115 as @xmath116 .",

    "denote @xmath117 ; by the convexity of  @xmath31 , the set  @xmath118 is compact and convex .",
    "all through , convex functions will mean convex downwards .    [ t_rec_trans ] the branching random walk in random environment is recurrent if and only if @xmath119 .",
    "note that the border case @xmath120 is transient . note also that , from the property  ( [ sup_beta>0 ] ) below , one obtains that @xmath119 if and only if @xmath121 .",
    "thus , given  @xmath118 , one can determine whether the branching random walk is recurrent or transient .",
    "the next result does not only tell us , similarly to theorem  1.10 of  @xcite , where the particles are located at time  @xmath21 , but it also gives an important information about the local size of the population .",
    "[ t_complete_shape ] for any closed @xmath122 , @xmath123 as @xmath116 , a.s .",
    "[ rem_complete_shape ] ( equivalence of models . )",
    "the local growth exponent @xmath31 is defined by ( [ shape_exp ] ) . by definition",
    "it only depends on the quenched expectation of the number of particles , and further , only on the mean number @xmath124 of particles sent in one step to  @xmath68 by one particle at the origin .",
    "indeed , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the environment shifted by @xmath127 , and where the sum ranges over all sequences @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "in particular , for any mapping @xmath130 from @xmath49 to itself such that @xmath131 for all @xmath132 , the two branching random walks in the environments  @xmath22 and  @xmath133 are equivalent , in the sense that they have the same local behavior at the logarithmic scale .",
    "fine details of the branching and displacement do not matter , under the above five conditions .",
    "moreover , for results that only concern the expected number of particles ( such as theorem  [ t_local_size ] ) we really do not need the assumption that any particle produces at least one offspring ; this can be substituted by a weaker assumption @xmath134 @xmath58-a.s .",
    "finally , we formulate a result about the total size of the population :    [ t_total_size ] the function  @xmath31 has the property @xmath135 for the total size of the population  @xmath136 , it holds that @xmath137 a.s .",
    ", as @xmath116 .",
    "note that , by  ( [ sup_beta>0 ] ) , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 by convexity . from theorems  [ t_local_size ] and  [ t_complete_shape ]",

    "[ ex1 ] * ( constant branching ) * more information can be obtained in the particular case when there exists a constant  @xmath141 such that @xmath142 in this case , the expected size of the population is @xmath143 .",

    ", we can define the transitions @xmath145 ( recall that @xmath146 only depends on @xmath147 ) , and consider the random walk in random environment  @xmath148 with transition probabilities @xmath149=p^{\\omega_x}(y)$ ] for @xmath150 .",

    "the limit can be expressed in terms of the quenched large deviation rate function  @xmath155 , which have been studied in the nestling case in @xcite and in complete generality in  @xcite : it holds that @xmath156 these references are for i.i.d .  environment and estimate the probability of sets in the scale  @xmath21 instead of the probability of points , but one can see that they apply to our discussion here .",
    "this example shows that the convex function @xmath31 is not necessarily strictly convex .",
    "indeed , it is known that the rate function has a flat horizontal part if the random walk in random environment is nestling with a non - zero speed @xmath157 , in which case @xmath158 for @xmath159 in the whole interval with endpoints @xmath160 and @xmath157 .",
    "finally , it is straightforward to see from the nearest neighbor jumps case , that the shapes @xmath161 and @xmath118 may have `` facets '' , i.e. , flat parts on their boundaries ( cf .",
    "e.g.  example  7 of  @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . first , in section  [ s_ind_rw ] we recall some concepts of  @xcite , such as recurrent seeds and induced random walks . in section  [ s_proof_shape_reach ]",
    "we study the set of sites which can be reached up to time  @xmath21 ( this amounts , basically , to applying the subadditive ergodic theorem ) . in section  [ s_proof_t_local_size ]",
    "we prove the results related to the _ expected _ local population size , and in section  [ s_proof_t_complete_shape ] we study the local population size itself .",
    "finally , in section  [ s_proof_exp_growth ] we prove the equation  ( [ sup_beta>0 ] ) , i.e. , that the expectation of the total number of particles grows exponentially ( somewhat surprisingly , this is one of the most difficult results of this paper ) , and then we prove theorem  [ t_total_size ] .",
    "to begin , we introduce some more basic notations .",
    "we denote by  @xmath162 the set of rational numbers , and define @xmath163 .",
    "let  @xmath164 to be the maximal jump length , i.e. , @xmath165 and let  @xmath166 be the @xmath0-dimensional discrete ball with respect to the @xmath167-norm : @xmath168    as in section  2.1 of  @xcite , we define now the notion of _ induced _ random walk in random environment associated with the branching random walk in random environment .",
    "defining @xmath169 we consider some probability measure @xmath170 on @xmath171 with marginal  @xmath58 on @xmath172 .",
    "a stationary random field @xmath173 with the law @xmath170 defines our branching random walk as above , coupled with a random walk in random environment with transition probability @xmath174 from @xmath7 to @xmath65 . in words , we pick randomly one of the children in the branching random walk . to keep things simple",
    ", we will drop the tilde from the notations @xmath170 . in this paper , we need only the so - called uniform induced random walk , for which the measure  @xmath175 is defined as follows : @xmath175 is uniform on the locations @xmath176 .",
    "an important idea that will be repeatedly employed in this paper is to use the uniform ellipticity of the walk in order to reveal some independence in the environment : because of condition  ue , the uniform induced random walk is uniformly elliptic as well , and so sometimes it makes its steps `` without looking at the environment '' .",
    "a similar construction can be found in  @xcite .",
    "specifically , let us consider the uniform induced random walk @xmath177 ( @xmath20 stands for the starting location of this random walk ) .",
    "according to  ( [ prob_ind_rw ] ) , the transition probabilities for @xmath177 are : @xmath178          = \\sum_{v : v_y\\geq 1}\\frac{\\omega_x(v)}{|\\{u : v_u\\geq 1\\}|},\\ ] ] which means that , in the case when a particle has more than one offspring in the branching random walk ( i.e. , it produces a configuration  @xmath157 with @xmath179 ) , the next ( relative ) location for the uniform induced random walk is chosen uniformly among the locations @xmath176 . by condition",

    "we still keep the symbol @xmath187 to denote the probability on the enlarged probability space where both the branching random walk  and the sequence @xmath188 are defined .",
    "set @xmath189 .",
    "let us enumerate the elements of the set @xmath190 in some order , so that @xmath191 .",
