    "the parameter space of nonlinear dynamical systems often exhibits a rich variety of qualitatively different types of behavior , such as periodic and chaotic regimes . especially if more than one parameter is responsible for the resulting complex bifurcation scenario , settings leading to the same types of dynamics are often mutually entangled in a rather complicated way .",
    "a specific example are so - called _ shrimps _ , a specific kind of periodic windows embedded in chaotic regimes in the two - dimensional parameter space of a large class of systems , which are characterized by a distinct structure consisting of a main body and four thin legs  @xcite .",
    "the exact properties of such structures however depend on the specific system under study . in general",
    ", shrimps often display self - similarity and are regularly organized along some distinguished directions  @xcite .",
    "the particular orientation depends on the respective stability conditions . when crossing the borders of shrimps in different directions , the system typically shows different bifurcation scenarios from periodic dynamics to chaos , e.g. , via period doubling or via intermittency  @xcite .",
    "a detailed stability analysis of the periodic solutions contained within shrimps , therefore , presents a promising approach for understanding the dynamical backbone of these structures .",
    "consequently , the study of this particular type of structure has recently attracted considerable interest .",
    "the emergence of shrimps has firstly been described in great detail for chaotic maps  @xcite , although corresponding structures have already been reported in earlier studies for both maps and time - continuous systems  @xcite . in the last years",
    ", additional efforts have been spent on numerically identifying such structures in systems of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) as well  @xcite .",
    "examples include the rssler system  @xcite , integrate - and - fire models of neurophysiological oscillations  @xcite , two coupled parametrically excited oscillators  @xcite , models of laser dynamics  @xcite , the damped - driven duffing system  @xcite , different nonlinear electronic circuits  @xcite , chemical oscillators  @xcite , the lorenz-84 low - order atmospheric circulation model  @xcite , or a vibro - impact system  @xcite .",
    "recently , shrimp structures have been experimentally found in the chaotic chua  @xcite and nishio - inaba circuits  @xcite , which underlines the increasing importance of proper numerical algorithms for automatically identifying such periodic windows in both theoretical and experimental studies , possibly even in the presence of noise .",
    "typically , at the boundaries of a shrimp , small inaccuracies of the parameters induce dramatic changes in the resulting dynamics .",
    "therefore , these structures can hardly be uncovered by existing analytical methods based on linear stability analysis , impossible in particular at the boundaries .",
    "in most recent works for continuous systems , the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath0 has been estimated numerically , which allows distinguishing periodic and chaotic dynamics since @xmath1 for periodic orbits and @xmath2 for chaotic ones .",
    "recently , an alternative method has been proposed for uncovering shrimps in systems described by odes  @xcite based on the concept of correlation entropy @xmath3 , which can be considered as a lower bound for the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents of the system  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that considering @xmath4 indeed yields results of comparable accuracy as the maximum lyapunov exponent method  @xcite and is more efficient , because less data points are needed .",
    "a convenient way for numerically estimating @xmath3 is using _ recurrence plots _ ( rps ) , an efficient technique of nonlinear time series analysis . given a trajectory of a dynamical system consisting of different values @xmath5 , where @xmath6 indicates the time of observation , the corresponding rp is defined as  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the heaviside function , @xmath9 is the distance between two observations @xmath5 and @xmath10 in phase space ( which will be measured in terms of the maximum norm in the following ) , and @xmath11 a pre - defined threshold for the proximity of two states in phase space , i.e. , for distinguishing whether or not two observations are neighbors in phase space .",
    "hence , the basic mathematical structure describing a rp is the binary recurrence matrix @xmath12 . visualizing this matrix by black ( @xmath13 ) and white ( @xmath14 ) dots ,",
    "different types of dynamics can be identified in terms of different features of line structures ( including discrete points , blocks , and extended diagonal or vertical lines ) , which can be quantitatively assessed in terms of recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa , see sec .",
    "[ sec : rqa ] ) .",
    "the recurrence plot based estimation of @xmath3 involves two main steps : ( i ) computing the cumulative probability distributions of the lengths of diagonal lines , and ( ii ) properly selecting a scaling region in dependence on the diagonal line length @xmath15 and evaluating its characteristic parameters  @xcite .",
    "since the second step assumes the existence of sufficient convergence in a reasonable regime , in practical applications various values of @xmath11 need to be considered for properly detecting the corresponding scaling region .",
    "hence , this approach is partially subjective and depends on the specific choice of the scaling region .    in this work ,",
    "we suggest and thoroughly study alternative approaches to analyze quantitatively the corresponding properties of the recurrence matrix .",
    "more specifically , we apply measures from complex network theory to the recurrence structures and compare their performance with that of more traditional rqa measures .",
    "the corresponding framework of recurrence networks ( rns ) , i.e. , the idea of interpreting the recurrence matrix @xmath12 of eq .",
    "( [ rp_definition ] ) as the adjacency matrix @xmath16 of an undirected , unweighted complex network by setting @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the kronecker delta , has been recently proposed for identifying dynamical transitions in model systems such as the logistic map  @xcite , as well as detecting subtle changes in a marine dust flow record .",
    "it should be noted that similar approaches of understanding the properties of time series from complex network perspectives have been suggested in parallel by various authors  @xcite ( see @xcite for further references ) .",
    "while most classical rqa measures are based on line structures in the rp , complex network measures reveal higher - order properties of the phase space density of states of the considered dynamical system  @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : net ] ) .",
    "however , the question whether the complex network approach is more suitable than conventional rqa for distinguishing different types of dynamics has not yet been systematically addressed . in this work ,",
    "we provide a corresponding comparative analysis using some particularly well - suited measures of both types .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate clear advantages of complex network measures in identifying shrimp structures or , even more , arbitrary complex periodic windows in the two - dimensional parameter space of certain dynamical systems by taking the well - studied rssler system as an illustrative benchmark example .",
    "the performance of different measures is compared by means of several statistical tests based on the resulting patterns in the parameter space .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we briefly review some rqa as well as complex network measures and outline important technical issues arising when using these measures , in particular , the dependence on the choice of the recurrence threshold @xmath11 and other parameters . a specific part of the two - dimensional parameter space of the rssler system that is known to contain shrimps is examined in sec .",

    "the main conclusions of our work are summarized in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) has been introduced for quantifying the presence of specific structures in rps @xcite . during the last years , numerous methodological developments and applications in various fields of science",
    "have been reported ( for a corresponding review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "most traditional rqa measures are based on the length distributions of diagonal or vertical lines . in this work",
    ", we will particularly make use of the following three quantities :    * the * recurrence rate * @xmath19 measures the fraction of recurrence points in a rp and , hence , gives the mean probability of recurrences in the system . * the * determinism * @xmath20 is defined as the percentage of recurrence points belonging to diagonal lines of at least length @xmath21 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : lmin ] for details ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the probability of finding a diagonal line of length @xmath15 in the rp .",
    "this measure quantifies the predictability of a system . *",
    "the * average diagonal line length * @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 characterizes the average time that two segments of a trajectory stay in the vicinity of each other , and is related to the mean predictability time .",
    "in addition to ( diagonal as well as vertical ) line - based rqa measures , in some cases , parameters characterizing recurrence times ( i.e. , vertical distances between two recurrence points ) based on the rps have been suggested to be suitable for quantifying basic properties of the recorded dynamics  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider in what sense rqa measures behave differently in the presence of periodic and chaotic dynamics . in a rp , a periodic orbit",
    "is reflected by long non - interrupted diagonal lines that are separated by a constant offset , which corresponds to the period of the oscillation ( fig .",
    "[ rp_pc]a ) .",
    "in contrast , for a chaotic trajectory , the distances between diagonal lines are not constant due to multiple time scales present in the system ( fig .",
    "[ rp_pc]b ) .",
    "furthermore , the existing diagonals are interrupted because of the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "therefore , we expect that both @xmath20 and @xmath24 typically have larger values for a periodic trajectory than for a chaotic one .",
    "recurrence networks ( rns ) are spatial networks representing local neighborhood relationships in the phase space of a dynamical system . in a rn , every sampled point is represented by a vertex @xmath26 , whereas edges indicate pairs of observations whose mutual distance in phase space is smaller than the pre - defined threshold @xmath11 . the resulting edge density @xmath27 , i.e. , the relative fraction of edges that are actually present in comparison to a fully connected network , is then given by @xmath28 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rr ] ) ) . hence",
    ", characterizing topological properties of rps by sophisticated network - theoretic quantifiers allows retrieving additional information about higher - order phase space properties of the system  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these measures are able to capture dynamical transitions in complex systems , such as in the logistic map with changing control parameter or a real - world paleoclimatic time series , demonstrating that network - theoretic features provide additional and complementary information when compared to traditional rqa measures  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we particularly consider the global clustering coefficient @xmath29 and the average path length @xmath30 of a rn .",
    "the application of other measures ( e.g. , betweenness centrality ) is straightforward , but we argue that the description of network topology by a scalar parameter instead of a distribution of vertex- or edge - based statistics might be more suitable for detecting and quantifying qualitative changes in the dynamics of a system .",
    "moreover , one has to note that state - of - the - art numerical algorithms for computing other complex network measures often require considerably larger computational efforts than estimating traditional rqa measures .",
    "the local clustering coefficient @xmath31 characterizes the phase space geometry of an attractor in the @xmath11-neighborhood of a vertex @xmath26 .",
    "specifically , @xmath31 gives the probability that two randomly chosen neighbors of @xmath26 are also neighbors  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the degree centrality ( i.e. , the number of neighbors of @xmath26 , which coincides with the local recurrence rate @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 is the total number of closed triangular subgraphs including @xmath26 , which is normalized by the maximum possible value @xmath36 . for vertices of degree @xmath37 or @xmath38 ( i.e. , isolated or tree - like vertices , respectively ) ,",
    "@xmath39 by definition since such vertices can not participate in triangles . instead of studying @xmath31 individually for all vertices of a rn",
    ", we consider its average value taken over all vertices of a network , the * global clustering coefficient * @xmath40 as a global characteristic parameter of network topology .",
    "the local clustering coefficient @xmath31 is related to the effective dimensionality of the set of observations in the @xmath11-neighborhood of a vertex @xmath26  @xcite . in particular , we find specific dependencies for both continuous and discrete dynamical systems :    a.   for discrete systems , periodic orbits consist only of a finite set of points .",
    "this implies that for @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the attractor diameter , the rn is decomposed into disjoint components with multiple vertices being located at the same point in phase space . as a consequence , the individual components are fully connected for all @xmath43 , which leads to @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast , for chaotic trajectories , sufficiently small @xmath45 results in @xmath46  @xcite . b.   for a continuous system , it is a well - established fact that if a chaotic trajectory enters the neighborhood of an unstable periodic orbit ( upo ) , it stays within this neighborhood for a certain time  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "states accumulate along this upo instead of homogeneously filling the phase space in the corresponding neighborhood ( in particular if we consider upos of lower period ) .",
    "since from the theory of spatial random graphs  @xcite it is known that the average clustering coefficient increases with decreasing spatial dimension of the space in which a network is embedded , it follows that parts of a chaotic attractor that are close to ( low - periodic ) upos are characterized by higher values of @xmath31 in the resulting rns  @xcite . following a related argument",
    ", we expect that states on a periodic orbit of a continuous system are also characterized by high values of @xmath31 , which implies high @xmath29 .",
    "in general , however , for chaotic trajectories the filling of the phase space with observed states is more homogeneous than for periodic ones , which leads to a tendency towards lower values of @xmath31 and , hence , @xmath29 .",
    "a second global measure of network topology is the * average path length*. since we consider rns as undirected and unweighted , we define all edges to be of unit length in terms of graph ( geodesic ) distance .",
    "the graph distance between any two vertices of the network is defined as the length of the shortest path between them .",
    "hence , the shortest path length @xmath47 in the rn gives the minimum number of edges that have to be passed on a graph between two vertices @xmath6 and @xmath48 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath47 is related to the phase space distance of the associated states , but _ not _ to the temporal evolution of the system ( fig .",
    "[ path_pc ] ) .    the average path length @xmath30 is defined as the mean value of the shortest path lengths",
    "@xmath47 taken over all pairs of vertices @xmath49 , @xmath50 for disconnected pairs of vertices , the shortest path length is set to zero by definition .",
    "note that in most practical applications , this has no major impact on the corresponding statistics .",
    "the average path length is related to the average separation of states in phase space , which measures the size of the attractor in units of @xmath11 . note that since metric distances in the phase space are conserved , this implies an approximately reciprocal relationship @xmath51  @xcite , with the exception of periodic orbits of discrete maps ( see the arguments given above ) .    for the behavior of the average path length @xmath30",
    ", one has to carefully distinguish between continuous and discrete systems again :    a.   for discrete systems , the structure of a periodic orbit in phase space implies @xmath52 by definition for @xmath53  @xcite . in turn , for chaotic trajectories , there is a continuum of possible values , so that @xmath54 for @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the average path length of a periodic orbit is smaller than that of a chaotic one . b.   for continuous systems , however , a periodic trajectory has a completely different structure in phase space , which means that @xmath30 is approximately determined by the curve length of the orbit in the phase space ( fig .",
    "[ path_pc]a ) .",
    "in contrast , for chaotic trajectories , there are `` short - cuts '' that allow reaching one position in phase space from another with a lower number of steps than by following the trajectory  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ path_pc]b ) . consequently , for a comparable attractor diameter @xmath55 and the same recurrence threshold @xmath11",
    ", @xmath30 can be expected to have lower values for chaotic orbits .",
    "alternatively , it is desirable to fix @xmath28 instead of @xmath11 to obtain rns with approximately the same numbers of edges .",
    "a detailed discussion on the advantages of this approach is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : rr ] . in this case",
    ", we note that the different geometric structure of the attractor in both the periodic and chaotic regime even enhances the effect of shortcuts , so that under general conditions , periodic orbits of continuous systems are characterized by larger @xmath30 than chaotic ones .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    concerning the behavior of the average path length as shown in fig .",
    "[ path_pc ] , we have to point out that differences between periodic and chaotic dynamics require that transient behavior ( e.g. , during some initial phase of the dynamics before the attractor has been reached by the considered trajectory ) has been sufficiently removed , since such transients could also result in artificial short - cuts in phase space for periodic systems .",
    "while this problem can be easily solved in numerical studies by simply discarding the transients , it can contribute additional uncertainties in experimental studies where only a limited amount of data is available . in a similar way , using @xmath30 for discriminating between periodic dynamics and chaos in noisy experimental time series is expected to lead to the same problem .",
    "however , in such cases , other network - theoretic quantities ( e.g. , @xmath29 ) still provide feasible alternatives , to which the mentioned conceptual problem does not apply ( at least for sufficiently small noise levels that do not exceed the order of magnitude of the recurrence threshold @xmath11 ) .",
    "in addition , there are other recurrence - based techniques such as recurrence time statistics , which allow distinguishing regular and chaotic dynamics even in challenging situations , e.g. , quasi - periodicity versus weakly chaotic behavior  @xcite .    in summary",
    ", @xmath29 shows a consistent behavior for discrete and continuous systems , whereas @xmath30 performs inversely with respect to periodic and chaotic dynamics .",
    "this implies , that @xmath30 can not be used alone to _ classify _ the dynamics of time series from real systems , where the nature of the underlying process is unknown .",
    "our results presented in this work and elsewhere  @xcite suggest , however , that @xmath30 is nevertheless very well able to _ distinguish _ between periodic and chaotic behavior in the parameter space of the same dynamical system .",
    "as an illustrative example for a time - continuous dynamical system that shows shrimp structures in its parameter space , we study the rssler system @xmath56 in this system , @xmath57 is often regarded as the standard bifurcation parameter , whereas @xmath58 and @xmath59 mainly change the shape of the attractor . in this work , however , we vary @xmath60 on the one hand , and @xmath57 on the other hand , which yields a two - dimensional parameter space of @xmath61 . one of the parameter regions of special interest is @xmath62 \\times [ 0.2,0.3]$ ] , where the chaotic regime is intermingled with periodic windows in a complex manner  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the following , we pay special attention to this part of the parameter space .",
    "note that shrimp structures are not confined to this particular plane in the three - dimensional parameter space of the rssler system and , hence , investigating a differently oriented plane as in  @xcite would not qualitatively alter the results of our study .    for further analysis ,",
    "the above mentioned part of the parameter space of @xmath61 is divided into @xmath63 grid points , which results in the step size @xmath64 in @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 in @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "we first consider the maximum lyapunov exponent of the resulting systems as a characteristic measure to determine whether the trajectories resulting from each parameter combination are chaotic or periodic .",
    "for this purpose , all three lyapunov exponents @xmath68 have been computed based on eq .",
    "( [ ros_eqs ] ) by numerically solving the associated variational equations  @xcite .",
    "numerical integration is carried out using a fourth - order runge - kutta integrator with a fixed step size of @xmath69 time units and randomly chosen initial conditions @xmath70\\times[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ ] . in order to provide sufficient data for an accurate estimation of lyapunov exponents ,",
    "the integration is performed for sufficiently long time ( until @xmath71 , i.e. , involving @xmath72 data points with a sampling @xmath73 corresponding to the considered integration step @xmath74 ) . for computing the different recurrence - based measures in a second step of analysis , the initial transients ( cf .",
    "[ sec : net ] ) have been discarded by removing the first @xmath75 iterations ( i.e. , all data until @xmath76 ) from the simulated trajectories . moreover , for all further calculations based on the recurrence matrices , a coarser sampling of @xmath77 ( i.e. , 200 integration steps ) has been considered . for each trajectory , the sampling has been terminated after @xmath78 points ( corresponding to about @xmath79 oscillations of the system ) have been obtained , yielding much shorter time series than those used for estimating lyapunov exponents .",
    "note that the specific choice of sampling time has a certain influence on the results discussed in the following .",

    "in contrast to all other kinds of statistical tests , the roc analysis suggests that in the specific setting studied in this work , among the four considered measures , @xmath29 is the most suitable statistics for discriminating between periodic and chaotic behavior of the rssler system , followed by @xmath30 , @xmath20 , and @xmath24 .     ,",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one has to note that the overall classification error @xmath124 ( with @xmath125 being the relative frequency of false detections of chaotic dynamics ) still reaches values of around @xmath126 even for the best performing measures ( fig .",
    "[ failure_p]d ) .",
    "the main reason for this performance failure is the different sensitivity of @xmath89 and the recurrence - based measures close to the bifurcation lines ( see fig .",
    "[ errorpattern ] ) . apart from this",
    ", all four measures allow recovering the overall structures in parameter space comparably well as @xmath89 .",
    "the obvious differences in the transition regions could be related to the use of short time series in regions with a complex bifurcation scenario , which are probably affected by problematic features such as longer transients before the attractor is reached ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : net ] ) , different bifurcation scenarios characterizing the transition between periodic and chaotic dynamics across different boundaries of the same shrimp , intermittency , or different stiffness properties of the considered trajectories  @xcite .     ,",
    "we have proposed to use nonlinear recurrence - based characteristics of time series for exploring the parameter space of complex systems .",
    "this is of special importance when dealing with experimental data .",
    "specifically , for distinguishing periodic and chaotic dynamics , in the recent literature estimates of the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath89 from the corresponding odes have most often been used , which allow resolving the borders of shrimps in a satisfactory way ( see fig .",
    "[ lyap_ac ] ) .",
    "this specific approach works well if the associated variational equations are provided explicitly .",
    "however , if these equations are not available ( as in the case of experimental data ) , the _ numerical _ estimation of @xmath89 is typically much more challenging , especially when dealing with short time series  @xcite .",
    "the recurrence - based measures used in this work have the advantage that they can be properly estimated from rather short time series , so that they could prove advantageous also in situations where the available amount of data is not sufficient for obtaining reliable estimates of lyapunov exponents . using recurrence - based methods instead of lyapunov exponents",
    "therefore has great potentials for the automatized discrimination between different types of dynamics in many applications .",
    "specifically , the alternative discriminatory statistics introduced in this work could become very helpful not only in evaluating , but also already in designing both experimental and numerical studies , since the requirements concerning the necessary amount of data can be much easier matched . as a perspective , we therefore expect that systematic application of the proposed methods will open new fields of applications , as it has already been the case with the introduction of rqa  @xcite . however , there are still situations where the consideration of lyapunov exponents is clearly superior for detecting periodic windows in comparison to the recurrence - based approach , in particular when the governing equations are explicitly known or the available observations of the considered systems are very long .",
    "it will remain a subject of future studies to investigate in more detail under which specific conditions which of the two approaches is favorable .",
    "another traditional idea to distinguish periodic behavior from chaotic dynamics is to use a properly defined surface in phase space for a poincar section , since a periodic trajectory has only a finite number of intersection points with this surface , while a chaotic one renders an infinite number of crossings .",
    "note , however , that constructing a proper poincar section for a given set of odes  @xcite is much easier than it is the case when working with time series , where one most often relies on some interpolation techniques to find crossings on the section , which obviously introduces noise - like effects  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are no universal criteria for choosing poincar sections when scanning a large parameter space ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ lyap_ac ] ) since the shape and the orientation of the attractors typically vary for different parameter values .    in this work ,",
    "we have been particularly interested in the problem of detecting specific periodic windows in parameter space , so - called shrimps , which are characterized by a rich bifurcation scenario and self - similarity .",
    "specifically , we have addressed the problem of numerically detecting shrimps in systems of odes , while the related question of the associated bifurcation scenarios remains a subject for future investigations .",
    "we expect the recurrence - based methods proposed in this work to be particularly useful for this problem , especially concerning the properties of secondary shrimps and the quantitative analysis of possible transient behavior .    for properly identifying shrimps in parameter space based on recurrence plots ,",
    "both measures from rqa and complex network theory have been applied . for the @xmath61 parameter plane of the rssler system , especially the recently proposed application of network measures to the recurrence matrix of complex systems  @xcite yields results coinciding well with those obtained using @xmath89 .",
    "the used rqa measures in this paper need two parameters recurrence rate @xmath28 and minimum line length @xmath21 , rn measures depend exclusively on @xmath28 .",
    "we have to emphasize that this conceptual advantage comes at the cost of higher computational demands , especially when considering the average path length @xmath30 of the rns .",
    "however , the clustering coefficient @xmath29 , which has been found to perform best in our example when considering the most sophisticated statistical evaluation ( roc analysis ) , can be calculated at significantly lower costs .",
    "generally , @xmath29 seems to be very well suited for distinguishing periodic from chaotic dynamics , even for time series sampled at a very high rate , such as the examples presented in this work .",
    "however , for high sampling rates , @xmath20 and @xmath24 can have a reduced discriminatory performance since the typical line structures become too similar  @xcite .",
    "we additionally note that both network measures have shown a slightly better discriminatory power for secondary shrimps than the two rqa measures @xmath20 and @xmath24 , at least for the specific setting used in this study . as we have not explicitly shown here ,",
    "even larger performance errors can be observed for other line - based rqa measures .",
    "a more detailed investigation of possible impacts of other choices of @xmath21 and @xmath28 has not yet been systematically performed , but will be subject of future studies . as a preliminary result ,",
    "repeating all presented calculations with a different value of @xmath127 supports all results discussed in detail for @xmath128 in this paper .",
    "the two specific network - theoretic quantities considered here have already been shown to be able to detect dynamical transitions in both model systems and real - world time series  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that since both measures are invariant under permutations of the time coordinate  @xcite , they exclusively capture the geometry of states associated to a specific trajectory in phase space .",
    "this is a distinctive difference to most existing methods of time series analysis , which are related to the study of temporal correlations .",
    "we hypothesize that the good performance of network measures in detecting shrimps could be related to this fact , since network measures take only information about spatial correlations ( i.e. , neighborhood relationships in phase space ) into account .    while a rigorous theory interrelating the phase space properties captured by rn measures to traditional dynamical invariants is still missing , the algorithm for estimating the correlation entropy @xmath3 from rps ( which has also been successfully applied for detecting shrimps in continuous systems",
    "@xcite ) has been justified theoretically  @xcite . since the estimation of @xmath3 , however , involves several steps  @xcite with some subjective issues ( in particular , the choice of the scaling region for convergence ) , its computational demands are significantly higher than those of the complex network as well as rqa measures applied in this work .",
    "particularly , a large range of values of @xmath28 ( @xmath129 ) is often considered to yield a well defined plateau of @xmath130 , while the method proposed in this paper works with just one chosen value of @xmath28 , dramatically reducing computational costs . systematically calculating rn statistics as well as rqa measures",
    "can be easily automatized using a fixed recurrence rate @xmath28 , ideally with @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "hence , we conclude that our approach allows a systematic numerical discrimination between periodic and chaotic dynamics of a continuous system , which is more practicable than other possible techniques especially when systematically studying higher - dimensional parameter spaces .    in relation with the problem of discriminating between two qualitatively different types of dynamics in a binary way , which has been discussed in this work ,",
    "lyapunov exponents have also found wide use in quantitatively characterizing the `` chaoticity '' of complex dynamics . following the results from tab .",
    "[ tab_indicators ] , we emphasize that the recurrence - based characteristics considered in this work may be used for similar purposes .",
    "in contrast to the discriminatory power , our corresponding initial results suggest that the applied rqa measures may be somewhat better suited for this purpose than the network - based concepts .",
    "however , further detailed statistical analysis is necessary in order to provide further evidence that this result holds in general .",
    "a detailed treatment of this question therefore remains subject of future studies ."
