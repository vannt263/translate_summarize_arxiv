    "the multichannel kondo model @xcite is the simplest impurity model with non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "originally introduced to describe `` real metals '' with magnetic impurities , its applications go beyond the study of dilute magnetic alloys .",
    "for instance , it has been known for some time that systems consisting of heavy atoms tunneling between two neighboring sites and interacting with conduction electrons are a realization of the two - channel kondo model @xcite .",
    "another realization is the quadrupolar kondo effect in context of heavy fermions @xcite .",
    "a detailed account of various aspects and applications of the multichannel kondo model is given in ref .  .",
    "for materials such as @xmath11 or @xmath12 alloys , the tunneling may occur between an arbitrary number of levels .",
    "such systems could be modeled using a multichannel version of the coqblin - schrieffer model , a @xmath0 kondo model@xcite . here , @xmath4 is the number of spin degrees of freedom , and @xmath5 is the number of channels , or @xmath13 degrees of freedom .    in this article",
    "we present an exact solution of the @xmath14 kondo model , and study the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "we obtain the leading exponents for the impurity contribution to the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat for arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we also discuss the effects of channel anisotropy , which might drive the system from a fixed point with @xmath15 to a new fixed point where @xmath16 .",
    "the multichannel coqblin - schrieffer ( mccs ) model describes electrons carrying two sets of internal degrees of freedom , to be denoted spin and flavor ( or channel number ) , interacting with an impurity carrying only spin .",
    "the impurity is localized at a point chosen to be the origin .",
    "the hamiltonian reads ,    @xmath17    both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are fermionic fields , the former creates an electron at @xmath20 with spin index @xmath21 and flavor index @xmath22 , while the latter creates the impurity at @xmath23 . imposing the condition @xmath24",
    ", we have that @xmath25 represents the impurity spin operator in a representation of @xmath26 specified by a particular choice of the matrices @xmath27 , where the index @xmath28 runs from 1 to @xmath29 , the number of generators of @xmath26 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case in which the electrons are in the fundamental representation ( denoted by @xmath30 ) , and the impurity is in the totally symmetric representation obtained from the direct product of @xmath1 fundamental representations .",
    "the physical realizations discussed in the present paper correspond to the simplest case , @xmath31 ; the investigation of the @xmath32 cases gives us important insight into the general structure of the model and allows , in particular , for a comparison with the results obtained for the multichannel kondo model with impurity spin @xmath33 .    in most of this paper we will study the isotropic model , @xmath34 , with the symmetry @xmath35 .",
    "we will also assume that the different flavor levels are equally populated , @xmath36 .    in what follows shall solve the complete model and among other things , study its low - energy physics .",
    "as is well known , the low energy behavior of a system can often be described in terms of effective hamiltonians , that are simpler than the starting hamiltonian ; these are usually referred to as fixed points .",
    "we shall determine their properties from the exact solution .",
    "we shall find that the model possesses a variety of fixed points ( or low energy regimes ) , whose nature depends on the symmetry structure in the flavor sector and on the spin representation ( @xmath1 ) , generalizing the familiar @xmath37 case ( the multichannel kondo model @xcite . as previously , we shall identify the mechanism underlying the appearance of these fixed points as _ dynamical fusion _ by which electrons form spin complexes whose interaction with the impurity leads to a new behavior in the infrared @xcite .",
    "each complex consists of @xmath5 electrons fused into a local objects that transforms according to one - row young tableaux of length @xmath5 .    within the bethe - ansatz approach a precise description of the formation of these composites",
    "can be given .",
    "the linearized hamiltonian propagates separately the charge - spin - flavor degrees of freedom that make up the electron .",
    "therefore the effect of flavor on the spin degrees of freedom is recovered only in the physical space . to follow the dynamic coupling of spin and flavor",
    "we add some curvature which maintains the identity of the electron while allowing its components to interact .",
    "it has the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the curvature scale which is sent to infinity at the end of the calculation . adding this term allows for the formation of bound states in the flavor singlet channel , which interact strongly with the impurity , and determine the low - energy dynamics even after the curvature is removed .",
    "a close analogy is a small magnetic field introduced to probe for magnetization , which may survive after the field is removed . imposing a cut - off @xmath40 on the momentum variables guarantees the finiteness of the energy .",
    "other terms need to be added to the hamiltonian to maintain integrability , terms which we shall see below are irrelevant .    already for free fields",
    "the resulting theory is quite involved , and even the counting of states is not trivial@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the charge - spin - flavor separated basis is the natural one for the non - interacting problem , as we shall see later : it is the form to which the eigenstates tend when the interaction is turned off .",
    "we thus introduce the following elements :    * a second derivative term with a curvature scale , @xmath39 , @xmath41 which breaks charge - spin - flavor ( csf ) separation of the linear spectrum .",
    "once the electron composites are formed , and the low - energy spectrum of the theory is identified , the scale is taken to infinity .",
    "+ adding the term ( [ second ] ) also imposes restrictions on the form of the eigenstates which can be expressed in terms of the following counterterms without which the model is not integrable for finite @xmath39 : * an electron - electron interaction term , of the form @xmath42 + when no impurity is present @xmath43 can be chosen arbitrarily since the term has no effect on the linear spectrum .",
    "the linearized spectrum has a large degeneracy , and the inclusion of ( [ second ] ) and ( [ jt ] ) will provide a way to find the eigenstates . *",
    "a counterterm @xmath44 , of the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 needs to be added to the hamiltonian in order to preserve integrability at the origin ; this term vanishes once the curvature is removed , and plays no further role in the problem .",
    "a general fock state of @xmath47 electrons and one impurity can be written in the following form : @xmath48 in order for it to be an eigenstate the amplitudes @xmath49 must satisfy the equation @xmath50 , where the differential operator @xmath51 , known as the _ first quantized form of the hamiltonian _ , takes the form @xmath52 with @xmath53(@xmath54 ) the spin(flavor ) exchange operator , @xmath55 the fundamental representation @xmath30 is carried by the electron @xmath56 and the @xmath57 representation by the impurity . when the latter is also in the fundamental representation i.e. @xmath58 the hamiltonian can be rewritten as , @xmath59      we will assume for now that both the electrons and the impurity are in the fundamental representation of @xmath26 .",
    "the eigenstate amplitudes are combinations of plane waves with _ pseudo - momenta _",
    "@xmath60 , ( @xmath61 ) , and have coefficients that depend on the ordering of the electrons , and on the spin and the flavor indices .",
    "these coefficients are related through products of electron - impurity and electron - electron s - matrices that we will derive now .",
    "consider first the wavefunction describing one electron ( denote it by @xmath56 ) interacting with the impurity ( denote it by @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 applying @xmath51 to it we have ( we drop the indices in the amplitudes ) @xmath64 @xmath49 is an eigenstate of @xmath51 , with eigenvalue @xmath65 , if the terms in the second and third lines in ( [ amp2 ] ) vanish .",
    "the last two terms cancel each other due to the form of ( [ vx ] ) .",
    "the terms in the second line of ( [ amp2 ] ) cancel if the amplitudes @xmath66 and @xmath67 are related by the electron - impurity s - matrix @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is given by @xmath70    defining @xmath71 we can write @xmath72 ( notice that @xmath73 ) . eventually we will send the cutoff to infinity . therefore ,",
    "expanding @xmath74 to first order in @xmath75 @xmath76 we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 in the scaling limit , @xmath79 and @xmath80 have the same scaling behavior .",
    "we now consider the case of two electrons .",
    "we generalize the procedure followed in the case on one electron : divide the configuration space into regions inside each of which there is no interaction and the wavefunction is a superpositions of plane waves .",
    "they are six such regions in this case , corresponding to the ordering of three objects : two electrons and an impurity , and we label them by permutations @xmath81 .",
    "for example , the element @xmath82 labels the region where electron 1 is to the left of the impurity and electron 2 is to its right .",
    "we also introduce the notation @xmath83 to denote a function that takes the value 1 in the region @xmath84 and zero elsewhere .",
    "the two electron wave function is then of the form ( bethe - ansatz ) , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the antisymmetrizer .",
    "the amplitudes in the various regions are connected by @xmath89-matrices , e.g. @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , the electron- impurity @xmath89-matrix has been already determined in the one electron problem . for this ansatz to be consistent",
    "it must satisfy the yang - baxter relations , @xmath92 guaranteeing that the two paths from @xmath93 to @xmath94 yield the same answer .    what is the electron - electron @xmath89-matrix , @xmath95 ?",
    "there is no direct electron - electron interaction term in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , and one may be tempted to adopt the naive choice @xmath96 for the scattering matrix of electrons @xmath97 and @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , electron correlations are induced through the impurity .",
    "these show up immediately , since the naive choice does not satisfy the yang - baxter relations : @xmath98 and @xmath99 do not commute .",
    "this non commutativity captures some important aspects of the model : after electron @xmath97 crossed the impurity the latter is left in a different state than before .",
    "hence the state in which electron @xmath56 finds the impurity depends on whether it crosses the impurity before or after electron @xmath97 . herein lies the difference between a system of electrons interacting with a fixed potential ( a one - body problem since all electron see the same potential ) and a kondo system , where the impurity correlates the motion of all electrons .",
    "are we allowed to introduce a scattering matrix @xmath100 to satisfy the yang - baxter relations ?",
    "we proceed now to show that this is indeed the case , namely , the introduction of an electron - electron scattering matrix would not modify the original problem we set out to solve . consider first the space of free electrons with a linearized hamiltonian .",
    "the space is highly degenerate : for example the energy @xmath101 in the two electron space corresponds to a wave function @xmath102 for any choice of coefficients @xmath103 .",
    "equivalently , we can pick a basis of the form @xmath104 .",
    "the choice of @xmath105 is arbitrary in the two electron space , but if we wish to proceed to construct three ( and more ) electron wavefunctions then the scattering matrices satisfy must satisfy the ybe for electrons , @xmath106 .",
    "when the kondo interaction is turned on , the matrix @xmath98 is fixed by the interaction , which in turn picks the electron basis through the yang - baxter relations ( [ ybe ] ) .",
    "when the cut - off is present part of the degeneracy is removed already at the free electron level but the procedure still goes through . consider the model for two electrons away from the impurity .",
    "@xmath107 this cut - off hamiltonian is in the same universality class as the free linearized hamiltonian and possesses the same spectrum when the cut - off is sent to infinity ; its particular form was chosen so that the s - matrix it defines does indeed satisfy the ( [ ybe ] ) .",
    "again , we divide configuration space into two regions : @xmath108 and study the eigenvalue equation @xmath50 .",
    "we have @xmath109 the last line is identically zero ; counterterms of the form ( [ hcc ] ) are only necessary when the particles involved have different velocities .",
    "the rest of the terms proportional to @xmath110 cancel if the amplitudes in the different regions are related by the following electron - electron s - matrix , @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "such a s - matrix can be written as @xmath113 choosing @xmath114 allows us to express the @xmath89-matrix as , @xmath115 the s - matrices ( [ eis],[ees ] ) satisfy the yang - baxter conditions ( [ ybe ] ) , and also @xmath116 assuring that we were able to generate a cut - off version of the hamiltonian while maintaining integrability .",
    "the cut - off scheme we introduced generates a flavor component in the electron - electron @xmath89-matrix .",
    "clearly it captures the interaction among electrons induced by the impurity .",
    "more so , already for the free hamiltonian @xmath117 a non trivial s - matrix _ must _ be introduced if we choose an @xmath118 invariant basis ( which is appropriate for a subsequent inclusion of an impurity interaction ) rather than the simpler @xmath119 .",
    "a careful counting of states can be carried out @xcite to show that all expected states then appear with the correct degeneracies .",
    "it is instructive that this would not be the case for the naive choice @xmath120 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of a @xmath47-electron state are a generalization of the first line of ( [ amp3 ] ) .",
    "they are of the form @xmath121      in order to determine the spectrum , we impose periodic boundary conditions , and solve the corresponding eigenvalue problem .",
    "the procedure is standard @xcite and we skip here the details . the result is contained in the bethe ansatz equations ( bae ) which we proceed to write down .",
    "each of the degrees of freedom - charge , spin and flavor - is described by a set of variables whose number depends on the symmetry of the particular state .",
    "the charge degrees of freedom are given by the set @xmath122 .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are parameterized by the sets @xmath123 .",
    "finally , the flavor degrees of freedom are represented by the sets @xmath124 .",
    "the set of integers @xmath125 specify the symmetry of the spin component of the wave function given by a @xmath26 young tableau with the length @xmath126 of the @xmath127th row given by @xmath128 .",
    "similarly , the quantum numbers @xmath129 specify the symmetry of the flavor component .",
    "the equations are @xmath130    the next step is to solve the equations for all possible states , identify the ground state and the low energy excitations .",
    "subsequently , by summing over all excitation energies we shall obtain the partition function .",
    "the bae contain the cutoff @xmath39 which eventually is sent to infinity .",
    "we shall find that in this limit the equations reduce to a smaller set once the correct ground state has been identified .",
    "it is composed of _ string_-solutions ( see below ) corresponding to electron composites which interact most efficiently with the impurity . to sharpen our intuition we begin by some strong coupling considerations .      as mentioned , the mechanism underlying the physics of the multichannel kondo model is the dynamic formation of electron composites .",
    "we expect that those configurations are favored which allow minimization of the local interaction at the impurity site .",
    "consider then the general problem of finding the ground state of the following hamiltonian : @xmath131 where the set @xmath132 is an arbitrary representation of @xmath26 , and @xmath133 is the particular representation of the impurity , in our case it will typically be @xmath57 . in this article",
    "we will consider impurities with spin in a totally symmetric representation ( for more general representations see @xcite ) .",
    "each set is normalized : @xmath134 .",
    "the largest number of electrons allowed at the origin by the exclusion principle is @xmath135 .",
    "this is obtained by placing @xmath4 electrons in each of the channels .",
    "however , such a state is a singlet , both in spin and in flavor , and gives a zero contribution to ( [ casi1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the number of electrons that form the composite , @xmath136 , is such that @xmath137 .",
    "we will show here that if the impurity is in a totally symmetric representation , the electron composite that minimizes ( [ casi1 ] ) is made out of @xmath138 electrons .",
    "we will characterize the different representations of @xmath26 by their young tableaux .",
    "the fundamental representation is denoted by a box , @xmath139 , and the singlet by a point @xmath140 .",
    "the totally ( anti)symmetric representation resulting from the direct product of @xmath1 representations is denoted by a single ( column)row made out of @xmath1 boxes , where in the antisymmetric case we assume @xmath141 .",

    "an example of such a system is given by @xmath642.@xcite the alloy @xmath643 is a narrow gap semiconductor , but usually because of some intrinsic impurities it becomes metallic at low temperatures .",
    "since the @xmath644 ions are smaller than the @xmath645 ions and they are also attracted by their nearest neighbor @xmath646 ions , they form 8-state systems , and according to the our discussions in section  [ ss : fixpoint ] they would be good candidates for the @xmath647 model .",
    "however , while an unambiguous logarithmic anomaly has been observed in the resistivity of these materials,@xcite no non - fermi liquid behavior has been detected .",

    "furthermore , @xmath643 has very complicated properties : it has a soft phonon mode that drives the system trough a ferroelectric phase transition as a function of the @xmath648 concentration , and strong spin - orbit scattering which most likely spoils the @xmath389 symmetry of the electron spins as well .",
    "moreover , the measurements have been carried out at relatively large @xmath648 concentrations , where the interaction of the nls s can not be neglected any longer .",
    "it seems that in order to observe the non - fermi liquid scaling much more accurate measurements should be carried out at even lower temperatures and _ lower _ @xmath648 concentrations for _ several _ physical quantities and _ lower _ @xmath648 concentrations .",
    "one could also try to find a better candidate .",
    "since in the case of @xmath643 the formation of the nls s is induced by the ionic attractions , we think that experimentalists should search among multicomponent metals , where interstitials can occur in the material .    0.5 cm 0.7truecm    similarly to the case of the two - channel kondo model,@xcite another possible realization of the @xmath0 model could be possible by means of nanotechnologies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dots ] we show a double dot geometry which is a candidate for the realization of the @xmath10 model . in the leads the electrons can be described as free particles : @xmath649 where @xmath650 refers to the two leads and @xmath651 is the electron spin .",
    "the hamiltonian of the dots can be written as@xcite @xmath652 where @xmath653 is the index of the two dots , @xmath654 and @xmath655 are the charges of them , @xmath656 and @xmath657 denote the applied gate voltages in the figure , and the @xmath658 s denote different capacitances of the system.@xcite with a suitable choice of the gate voltages one can achieve that the ground state of the dots becomes three fold degenerate corresponding to the states @xmath659 , @xmath660 and @xmath661 .",
    "then the tunneling processes among the leads and the dots result in the simultaneous flips in the electrons orbital quantum number @xmath662 and the charge variables @xmath663 which now take over the role of the orbital index of the nls .",

    "we have studied the multichannel coqblin - schrieffer model ( mccs ) and its relation to the n - level system model ( nls ) .",

    ". the exception corresponds to @xmath8 , which yields the largest value of the residual entropy for fixed @xmath286 .",
    "the low - temperature thermodynamics are determined by the value of the ratio @xmath288 alone , for any @xmath162 .",

    "when @xmath671 , the power is replaced by a logarithm , as in the two - channel kondo model .",
    "the constant terms in ( [ fin1 ] ) are always present and are the dominant contributions in the completely screened case , @xmath665 , and when @xmath461 .",
    "the wilson ratio in such cases is given by @xmath672    channel anisotropy is a relevant perturbation .",
    "as the channel symmetry is reduced from @xmath172 to @xmath673 , the entropy is quenched since @xmath286 decreases and @xmath674 increases .",
    "likewise , a system with channel anisotropy might behave like a @xmath343 system at intermediate temperatures and flow at low-@xmath417 to a @xmath345 system .",
    "then we turned to the comparison of the mccs model to the n - level system model ( nls ) , describing a heavy particle tunneling between @xmath4 different positions and interacting with the conduction electrons .",
    "we have shown that the low - energy fixed point of the nls model is just the @xmath0 mccs model . performing a @xmath9 study of the nls model",
    "we have analyzed the operator content of this low - energy fixed point , and the scaling properties of different physical quantities in the @xmath450 limit .",
    "we have shown in this limit that while the operator content of the nls model is different from that of the mccs model , apart from some subtle differences , the low - energy properties of the two models are the same .",
    "especially , comparison with the exact results obtained in the first part of the paper and with the nca calculations@xcite show that the susceptibility , the residual entropy and the resistivity of the two models behave in the same way , and for reasonable physical parameters even the scaling of the specific heat is properly described by the mccs model .    finally , we discussed some possible physical realizations of the @xmath675 models .",
    "first we discussed the case of tunneling interstitials in multicomponent metals such as @xmath11 compounds .",
    "we pointed out that the low concentration of interstitials is essential to avoid strong inter - impurity interactions and keep the diagonal elements of the self - energy @xmath492 small .",
    "secondly , we suggested a double quantum dot structure that could give an ideal realization for the @xmath10 model .",
    "in the course of this investigation we learned of parallel work by a. georges , o. parcollet , g. kotliar and a. sengupta , using conformal field theory and large - n approach to study the same model .",
