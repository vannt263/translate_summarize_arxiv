    "equilibrium statistical mechanics provides us a well - established framework to deal with systems in thermal equilibrium .",
    "when a system is perturbed externally from its equilibrium state , the so - called _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ relates the _ linear response _ of the system ( to the external perturbation ) to the _ fluctuations _ properties of the system in equilibrium ( in the absence of the perturbation )  @xcite . within the framework of linear response theory , the green - kubo relation gives linear transport coefficients in terms of integral over time - correlation function of the corresponding current in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a general understanding of nonequilibrium ( arbitrarily far from equilibrium ) systems is rather poor .",
    "that is why there has been a lot of excitement surrounding the _ fluctuation theorem _ , which aims at making a general statement about the fluctuations of entropy production during a nonequilibrium process .",
    "the fluctuation theorem has been suggested as a natural extension of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem from the linear response regime to arbitrarily far from equilibrium , as the fluctuation theorem reduces to the green - kubo formula and the onsager reciprocity relations in the zero forcing limit  @xcite .",
    "imagine , two heat reservoirs at different temperatures connected by a thermal conductor . for a macroscopic object",
    ", we expect the heat to flow across the conductor from the hotter to the colder reservoir , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , for small systems , where microscopic fluctuations become important , once in a while we might observe heat to flow from the colder to the hotter reservoir .",
    "these reverse events are usually referred to as `` second law violation '' .",
    "the fluctuation theorem gives a mathematical expression for the ratio of the probability of `` obeying the second law '' to that of the `` second law violation '' .",
    "following a theoretical argument , evans _ et .",
    "al . _ found a relation between the probabilities of positive and negative entropy production in the nonequilibrium steady state , in a molecular dynamics simulation of a two - dimensional fluid driven by external shear and coupled to a thermostat  @xcite .",
    "gallavotti and cohen proved this relation ( and called it _ fluctuation theorem _ ) for the phase space contraction ( interpreted as the entropy production ) for dissipative dynamical systems in the nonequilibrium steady - state using _ chaotic hypothesis _ and time reversal invariance  @xcite .",
    "evans and searles had derived earlier a similar relation ( now known as the _ transient _ fluctuation theorem ) for systems starting from equilibrium initial condition  @xcite . for stochastic systems ,",
    "the fluctuation theorem has been proven by kurchan  @xcite for langevin dynamics and extended by lebowitz and spohn  @xcite to general markov processes .",
    "subsequently , there has been an explosion of research activities investigating the validity of the fluctuation theorem for other quantities such as work , power flux , heat flow , total entropy , etc . , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite",

    "analytical results have been obtained for the second system in  @xcite . in the first experiment , a colloidal particle immersed in water ( which acts as thermal bath ) is confined in an optical trap .",
    "the position of the trap is modulated according to a gaussian ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the authors have experimentally determined the probability density function ( pdf ) of the work done on the colloidal particle by the random force exerted by the modulating trap . in this paper",

    "an external time - varying random force is exerted by the trap on the brownian particle by externally modulating the position of the trap according to an ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an externally generated gaussian white ( non - thermal ) noise with mean @xmath18 and covariance @xmath19 .",
    "there is no correlation between the externally applied noise and the thermal noise , @xmath20 .",
    "the system eventually reaches steady state , and in the steady state the trap exerts a correlated random force @xmath21 on the brownian particle with mean @xmath22 and covariance @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity of our interest is the work done in the steady state , by the random force exerted by the trap on the brownian particle in a given time duration @xmath1 .",
    "this is given ( in units of @xmath24 ) by @xmath25 with the initial condition ( at @xmath26 ) drawn from the steady state distribution .",
    "it is convenient to use the following dimensionless parameters @xmath27 from an experimental perspective  @xcite , it is natural to use another parameter that measures the deviation of the system from equilibrium : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the variance of @xmath30 in the steady state in the presence of trap modulation , whereas @xmath31 is the corresponding variance at equilibrium , i.e. , without the presence of the trap modulation ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "it should be noted that , the three parameters introduced above are not independent of each others and are related by @xmath33    the mean work can be computed easily using the above equations and one finds @xmath34 for large @xmath1 .",
    "although the mean work is positive ( and large for large @xmath1 ) , there can be negative fluctuations ( with small probabilities ) and the fluctuation theorem quantifies the ratio of the probabilities of the positive and the negative fluctuations .",
    "however , the aim of this paper is not to merely check whether the fluctuation theorem is satisfied or not for this system , but to obtain the distribution of the work done ( for large @xmath1 ) , which contains much more information about the system than the former .",
    "to compute the distribution of @xmath0 , we first consider the moment generating function restricting to fixed initial and final configurations @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively : @xmath37 \\delta[y - y(\\tau ) ] \\bigr\\rangle_{(x_0,y_0 ) } , \\label{restricted gf}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 denotes an average over the histories of the thermal noises starting from the initial condition @xmath35 .",

    "the solution of the fokker - planck equation can be formally expressed in the eigenbases of the operator @xmath44 and the large @xmath1 behavior is dominated by the term having the largest eigenvalue .",
