    "a global structure of pulsar magnetosphere is one of key issues to understanding energy outflow to the exterior .",
    "the numerical model has been successfully developed in the past decade , although the basic equation was already derived in the early days of pulsar theory .",
    "extensive reviews are available in some books ( e.g , @xcite ) . @xcite calculated the stationary axially symmetric magnetosphere based on the force - free approximation .",
    "they for the first time showed a solution with dipole magnetic field lines near a neutron star , which smoothly pass through the light cylinder to the wind region at infinity . in the model",
    ", there is a current sheet flowing on the separatrix and equator outside the light cylinder .",
    "the magnetosphere model is subsequently explored in detail by several authors ; some physical properties represented by the solution @xcite , the y - point singularity between open and closed field lines on the equator @xcite , the electromagnetic luminosity in high numerical resolution @xcite .",
    "numerical construction of the magnetosphere around an aligned rotator is also performed using time - dependent codes with the force - free and mhd approximations @xcite .",
    "a stationary state , which is very similar to the solution given by @xcite , is obtained with certain initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the approach is extended to an oblique rotator by 3d simulation codes @xcite .",
    "an ideal mhd condition @xmath0 is used to determine the electric field in these calculations irrespective of the numerical methods .",
    "consequently , two electromagnetic field vectors are always orthogonal @xmath1 , and the parallel component of @xmath2 along the plasma motion vanishes everywhere .",
    "this condition holds if the plasma density much exceeds the goldreich - julian density @xcite .",
    "the global structure based on the force - free and mhd approximations is obviously a good step to understanding the whole magnetosphere .",
    "however , it is important to study how and where the condition breaks down , and how this changes the electromagnetic field structure and plasma behavior .",
    "an alternative approach , in which the ideal mhd condition is relaxed , is necessary to address these problems .",
    "breakdown of ideal mhd condition in the pulsar magnetosphere is qualitatively pointed out in the literature , e.g , @xcite .",
    "it is our purpose to further study the problem by actual modeling .",
    "it is necessary to determine the electric fields from the distribution of the charge density , since @xmath0 is no longer used .",
    "the electric acceleration or deceleration of fluids will be allowed elsewhere , since @xmath3 .",
    "the location may be important to the observation .    in this paper , we present an approach based on a two - fluid plasma consisting of positively and negatively charged particles . in this approach ,",
    "the electromagnetic fields are modeled by maxwell s equations with a plasma source .",
    "resultant electric fields are not in general perpendicular to magnetic fields @xmath4 , i.e , breakdown of ideal mhd condition",
    ". the stream lines of the plasma flows are not a priori assumed to coincide with the magnetic field lines .",
    "the plasma flows are determined by equation of motion under the electromagnetic forces . in this paper",
    ", we consider a simple plasma model , a cold dissipationless plasma , in which thermal pressure , pair creation or annihilation and radiation loss are neglected .",
    "if we further neglect the inertial terms in equations of motion , then we have the force - free and mhd conditions @xcite .",
    "we here keep the inertial terms , in order to model the magnetosphere taken into account one of non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "we also assume stationary axisymmetric states in the electromagnetic fields and the plasma flows .",
    "however , the azimuthal component of a vector is not zero in general .",
    "for example , a toroidal magnetic field @xmath5 can be produced by poloidal currents @xmath6 , in the spherical coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "this approach can be naturally extended to include other physical mechanisms in the future .",
    "this paper is , therefore , the first step towards including more physical processes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we discuss our numerical method to solve electromagnetic fields and fluid streams in two - dimensional meridian plane .",
    "the relevant boundary conditions are also given .",
    "a model of plasma injection is given at the inner boundary , a polar cap region .",
    "the angular dependence of the injection rates is different between positively and negatively charged particles , but the total is the same .",
    "the total current from the polar cap is therefore zero .",
    "this provides a model to construct magnetosphere with charge - separated plasma flow .",
    "this choice of the injection model is not unique . in section 3 ,",
    "we show our results of the global structure .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",

    "each component , consisting of positively or negatively charged particles , is described by a number density @xmath25 and velocity @xmath26 .",
    "note that the proper density @xmath27 is related with the lab - frame density @xmath25 by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a lorentz factor @xmath30 ( e.g , @xcite ) .",

    "we do not follow such a treatment , but rather solve eq.([motion.eqn ] ) for each component . using the identity @xmath45 @xmath46 , we find two conserved quantities along each stream line , corresponding to axially symmetric and stationary conditions .",
    "they are generalized angular momentum @xmath47 and bernoulli integral @xmath48 , which are obtained by the azimuthal component of eq.([motion.eqn ] ) and a scalar product of @xmath49 and eq.([motion.eqn ] ) @xcite .",

    "the difficulty and the limitation to smaller value of @xmath93 are closely related with boundary conditions and involved physics , as explained below .",
    "the bernoulli integral ( [ const.bern ] ) should satisfy a constraint @xmath101 . in our model , we specify @xmath102 by the injection condition which is fixed at the inner boundary . during the numerical iterations ,",
    "the magnitude of the function @xmath65 becomes very large in a certain region , where the condition @xmath103 is no longer satisfied .",
    "it is easily understood that this easily happens for large value of @xmath90 , since the typical scale of @xmath65 is @xmath104 .",
    "this gives a certain upper limit to the choice of @xmath93 .",
    "the actual estimate of the limit is somewhat complicated , since the potential @xmath65 depends on the choice of boundary conditions , especially injection model at inner radius .",
    "it is therefore necessary to explore consistent boundary conditions or to include some physical process , in order to calculate the models with larger @xmath93 .",
    "adjusting mechanism may be required at the boundary or within the numerical domain .",
    "for example , our present inner boundary is one - way , i.e , injection only at fixed rate . during numerical iterations ,",
    "the charge density might numerically blow up elsewhere due to poor boundary condition .",
    "if the injection rate is able to be adjusted or plasma is absorbed through the boundary , the increase may be suppressed .",
    "however , this is a very difficult back - reaction problem .",
    "the boundary conditions are normally used to determine the inner structures .",
    "the adjustable boundary conditions should be controlled by the interior .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions and the inner structures should be determined simultaneously .",
    "such numerical scheme is not known and should be developed in future . otherwise , extensive study to find out consistent boundary conditions for large @xmath93 is required .",
    "our numerical method will be improved by either approach .",
    "pulsar magnetosphere is described in most spatial region by the force - free and ideal mhd approximations , which correspond to the limit of @xmath105 .",
    "stationary axisymmetric magnetosphere is constructed so far by a solution of the grad - shafranov equation with these approximations @xcite .",
    "poloidal magnetic field approaches a quasi - spherical wind at infinity .",
    "there is a discontinuity in toroidal magnetic field at the boundary of the corotating region , where the current sheet is formed . @xcite",
    "have obtained an alternative solution of the same equation , but with a different injection current .",
    "their solution exhibits a jet along polar axis and a disk on the equator .",
    "there is no current sheet in their numerical model .",
    "thus there are at least two models in the strong magnetic field limit , @xmath105 .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field at infinity is quasi - spherical and there is no current sheet in our numerical solution .",
    "it is interesting to examine the model sequence by increasing the parameter @xmath93 .",
    "some plasma flow should be highly constrained to a thin region , or the jet - disk system should be formed in the large @xmath93 limit .",
    "it is unclear whether or not many solutions exist , depending on physical situations including the plasma state . in order to address these questions ,",
    "it is necessary to construct the magnetosphere with plasma flow beyond the force - free and ideal mhd approximations .",
