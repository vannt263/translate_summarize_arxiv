    "soon after quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) became established as the theory of strong interactions , the search for mesons with exotic @xmath4 quantum numbers was initiated .",
    "important experimental progress has occurred in identifying potential candidates for exotic mesons . among these",
    "are the two @xmath6 isovector states @xmath7 and @xmath8 which have been identified by two collaborations in the channels @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this gives the theorists an opportunity to compare their results for the exotic light hybrid mesons with the experimental observations .",
    "for instance , the widely cited mass prediction for the @xmath6 state from lattice qcd lies around 1.9 gev @xcite which disagrees with the experimental data .",
    "the decays of the @xmath5 hybrid meson have also been studied in the context of various models @xcite , and also appear to be in disagreement with the experimental data . a possible reason for",
    "these inconsistencies may derive from the fact that non - perturbative effects can not be easily controlled at this low energy scale .",
    "a further possibility is , of course , that the two new states may have been misidentified and are not hybrid mesons after all .",
    "it is clear that further theoretical studies of the properties of the hybrid mesons are necessary before one can be confident of their discovery .    in this paper , we concentrate on the mass prediction for the @xmath5 hybrid meson using the qcd laplace sum rule approach @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical studies found masses in the range 1.42.1  gev @xcite , with more recent estimates around 1.6 gev @xcite .",
    "these latter estimates are close to the @xmath8 but do not accommodate the state @xmath7 as a hybrid candidate . however , the qcd sum rule analysis is not very stable , which from sum - rule studies of scalar gluonium and the @xmath12 meson , could be attributed to the importance of nlo corrections associated with the dimension - four @xmath13 and dimension - six @xmath14 operators @xcite . in particular , the four - quark operator has the same dimension as the two point correlator of the @xmath5 current and its coefficient function is non - logarithmic in the leading order .",
    "thus the dimension - six contributions are absent in the next - to - lowest moment sum - rule , resulting in discrepancies with the mass prediction from the zeroth moment sum rule @xcite .",
    "thus it is interesting to determine whether the @xmath0-corrections can reduce this discrepancy . for consistency , the @xmath0-corrections to both the dimension - four @xmath13 and the dimension - six @xmath15 operators need to be included .    in this paper",
    ", we first give a brief introduction to the external field method used for our calculations .",
    "we then present our calculations for the @xmath0 corrections to @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we discuss the effect of the @xmath0-corrections on the mass prediction for the @xmath5 hybrid meson .",
    "in order to obtain the contribution of the operator @xmath16 in the operator product expansion ( ope ) expansion of the relevant current - current correlator , it is convenient to use the so - called external field method introduced in ref . @xcite . because we will use a slightly modified version of the external field method , we give a brief introduction to this method before carrying out our calculations .",
    "we first split the gauge field @xmath17 into two parts @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an external ( classical ) field and @xmath20 is a quantum field . in the following",
    "we will suppress the label  ext \" in @xmath19 for convenience . substituting ( [ field ] ) in the qcd lagrangian one obtains @xmath21 where @xmath22 } \\quad , \\quad d_\\mu=\\partial_\\mu + iga_\\mu+ iga_\\mu\\ ] ] the lagrangian ( [ lang ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath23 unlike in @xcite , we demand that the external field is invariant under the gauge transformation .",
    "therefore , any gauge condition imposed on the external field does not break the invariance under the gauge transformation ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the result given in @xcite , which states that the series of the ope for a correlator of gauge invariant currents does not depend on the choice the gauge of the external field .",
    "furthermore , in order to fix the gauge of the quantum field , we use the feynman gauge @xmath24 instead of the background gauge @xmath25 used in @xcite , where @xmath26 .",
    "this has the advantage that it can be shown that the external method in the covariant gauge is equivalent to the plane - wave method @xcite .",
    "note that , when the external field method is used , the background gauge very likely differs from the covariant gauge in processes where both the radiation field and the external field are present in the initial states and ( or ) the final states . in the processes where only the radiation field or the external field is present in the initial states and ( or ) the final states , there is no difference between the background gauge and the covariant gauge .",
    "for instance , if there is only the external field present in the initial and ( or ) final states , the radiation field is integrated out .",
    "then the external method in the background gauge is exactly the same as the original background gauge method @xcite .",
    "the later is consistent with the plane - wave method . if there is only the radiation field present in the initial state and ( or ) final state , we can switch off the external field .",
    "then there is no difference between the background gauge and the covariant gauge .",
    "the feynman rules in the feynman gauge can be obtained quite straightforwardly . under the infinitesimal gauge transformation @xmath27 one can easily derive the lagrangian for the ghost field @xmath28\\theta_b.\\ ] ] then , the external field @xmath29 obeys the same feynman rules as the radiation field @xmath30 .",
    "this is also consistent with the plane - wave method @xcite .",
    "the calculational techniques using the lagrangian ( [ lang ] ) are similar to those in the background gauge @xcite .    in order to extract the operator @xmath16 from the ope",
    ", the fock - schwinger condition is imposed on the external field @xmath31 then , with the aid of the technique proposed in @xcite , the gluon propagator in the presence of the external field can be obtained straightforwardly .",
    "for instance , up to the term @xmath32 the gluon propagator is given by @xmath33 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the dimension of space - time .",
    "as expected , the gluon propagator ( [ gp ] ) differs from the corresponding one given in @xcite .",
    "sometimes it is more convenient to do the calculation in coordinate space .",
    "the gluon propagator in coordinate space can be obtained by using the @xmath36-dimensional fourier transformation @xmath37 the necessary integration techniques in @xmath36-dimension were given in @xcite .",
    "one can convert the 4-dimensional quark propagator given in @xcite to the @xmath36-dimensional quark propagator @xmath38",
    "the two point correlator of the @xmath5 hybrid current is defined as @xmath41 where the current @xmath42 carries isospin @xmath43 and the invariants @xmath44 and @xmath45 correspond to the contributions from @xmath5 and @xmath46 states respectively .",
    "the renormalized current is denoted by @xmath47 , which in the massless quark limit , has the form @xmath48 where up to the order @xmath49 and in the feynman gauge the renormalization constant @xmath50 is given by @xcite @xmath51    the leading order calculation of ( [ cor ] ) including the quark and gluon condensate contributions are contained in @xcite , and the nlo corrections to the perturbative part of ( [ cor ] ) were calculated in @xcite .",
    "next we consider the nlo corrections to the gluonic condensate @xmath52 contributions .",
    "we divide the calculations into two parts .",
    "one part can be obtained via the calculations of feynman diagrams shown in figure [ glue_fig ] , where we do not display diagrams which vanish in dimensional regularization or which can be obtained from diagrams a  o in fig .",
