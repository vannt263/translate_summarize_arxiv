    "there is an emerging consensus that the core - collapse supernova mechanism is essentially aspherical and that instabilities and the breaking of spherical symmetry are keys to explosion ( buras et al .",

    "2006,2007 ; blondin , mezzacappa , & demarino 2003 ) .",
    "in modern simulations , due to copious neutrino losses , the tamp of accretion , and photodissociation , the direct hydrodynamic bounce mechanism always fails .",
    "the delayed neutrino - driven mechanism works in spherical models only for a small subset of the lightest massive star progenitors ( e.g. , @xmath2 m@xmath3 ; kitaura , janka , & hillebrandt 2006 ) .",
    "it works , if only marginally , in 2d simulations when aided by post - shock convection and overturn only for slightly more massive progenitors ( e.g , 11.2 m@xmath3 ; buras et al .",
    "the neutrino mechanism does work in the context of accretion - induced collapse ( aic ; dessart et al .",
    "2006a ) , but these systems must be rare .",
    "in all cases explored to date , when neutrino heating is the driving agency the explosion energies are not the canonical supernova values near 10@xmath4 ergs ( @xmath5 one bethe ) , but half a dex or more smaller . the low accretion densities that enable explosion also inhibit the deposition of neutrino energy .",
    "however , it is indeed possible that when credible 3d simulations are available , we will find that a robust neutrino mechanism obtains for the majority of the relevant progenitor mass range ( @xmath6 ?",
    "m@xmath3 ) .",
    "recently , burrows et al .",
    "( 2006,2007 ) have found that if the delay to explosion is long , perhaps 0.5 to 1.0 seconds , the inner core can be excited to oscillate in an @xmath7 g - mode which damps by the anisotropic emission of sound . at this late stage , acoustic power can rival or exceed neutrino deposition power and can explode the envelope .",
    "the excitation of core g - modes in this manner is unavoidable .",
    "the question is whether the pulsation amplitudes that can be achieved are adequate and whether the accretion / no - explosion phase lasts long enough to allow the core modes to excite to significance . given these desiderata , burrows et al .",
    "( 2007 ) witness the explosion of all the progenitors they studied . whether the acoustic mechanism , or a hybrid neutrino / acoustic mechanism , is relevant to supernova explosions remains to be seen , but it has several intriguing features , including the production of environments in which the r - process can occur and in which pulsar kicks are naturally imparted .",
    "a third general class of explosion mechanisms , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) , has a long history ( leblanc & wilson 1970 ; bisnovatyi - kogan et al .",

    "in addition , the possible role of magnetic winds in powering secondary explosions and in spinning down newly - born neutron stars or magnetars is being actively explored ( thompson ,  chang ,  &  quataert 2004 ; bucciantini et al .",
    "2006 ; metzger , thompson , & quataert 2006 ) .",
    "while modern models of whatever stripe of supernova explosion are very asymmetrical , mhd models are fundamentally so .    however , all credible mhd models require rapid rotation , which the current crop of solar - metallicity supernova progenitor models do not have ( hirschi ,  meynet ,  &  maeder 2004,2005 ; heger et al . 2000 ; heger , woosley , & spruit 2005 ) . pre - collapse spin periods of a few seconds may be needed , but heger , woosley , & spruit ( 2005 ) , for example , derive spin rates at collapse ten times slower for the cores of solar - metallicity stars",
    ". the rotational kinetic energies at bounce are consequently one hundred times smaller than required and are totally inadequate to power a supernova explosion . however , are these progenitor calculations correct ?",
    "could the progenitor cores of massive stars before collapse actually be rotating fast ?",
    "more conservatively , is there a subset of supernova progenitors that are spinning fast enough to make mhd processes relevant on explosion timescales ?",
    "importantly , the low - metallicity models of woosley & heger ( 2006 ) , some of which they suggest are grb progenitors , have much faster spinning cores at collapse .    in this paper , we explore the physics and phenomenology of mhd - driven explosions when and if suitably rapid initial rotation rates obtain and leave open the question of the progenitor systems in which they might .",
    "unlike all past investigations , we incorporate 2d multi - group neutrino radiation transport , a realistic equation of state , and realistic progenitor density , temperature , and composition structures .",
    "our current supernova code , vulcan/2d , has been upgraded to include mhd in 2.5d ( livne et al .",
    "we start at the onset of core collapse and follow the evolution from collapse , through bounce , to explosion , and all the way to many hundreds of milliseconds after explosion .",
    "we observe and document bipolar jet explosions due to magnetic stresses and buoyancy in magnetic towers ( uzdensky & macfadyen 2006ab ) , accretion and magnetic collimation of the jets , sausage / neck instabilities ( lampe 1991 ) , and the growth to quasi - steady state of the mhd engine power .",
    "the jets are powered and maintained by the kinetic energy in differential rotation , which for these calculations is often significantly more than one bethe . for the strongest jets ,",
    "we observe core spindown by magnetic torques .",
    "akiyama et al .",
    "( 2003 ) introduced into supernova theory the possibility that whatever the initial seed magnetic fields , the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 ; pessah & psaltis 2005 ; pessah , chan & psaltis 2006 ) , driven by the negative gradients in the angular velocity ( @xmath9 ) after bounce that are unavoidable in the context of core collapse ( ott et al . 2006 ) , could foster the growth to saturation values of poloidal ( @xmath10 ) and toroidal ( @xmath11 ) fields that are dynamically important .",

    "( 2006 ) , etienne , liu , & shapiro ( 2006 ) , and shibata et al .",
    "( 2006 ) make a good case that this is so .",
    "hence , if the shear in @xmath9 in the protoneutron star ( pns ; burrows & lattimer 1986 ) between @xmath1210 and @xmath12100 kilometers is large , we conclude that strong , if transient , magnetic fields with a dynamical role are inevitable in core collapse . in all situations with rapid rotation , the growth of b - fields due to compression , winding , and the mri ( and , perhaps , due to classical dynamo action ) will play an essential role in the explosion mechanism .",
    "this paper is a preliminary exploration of this scenario and its consequences .",
    "however , our simulations have a number of limitations .",
    "the calculations are newtonian , are done in 2d ( axisymmetric , plus rotation ) , and the transport is flux - limited ( not multi - angle ) .",
    "importantly , etienne , liu , & shapiro ( 2006 ) and shibata et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that 2d spatial grids with thousands - squared of points are required to properly resolve the mri in core - collapse simulations",
    ". moreover , obergaulinger , aloy , & mller ( 2006 ) and obergaulinger et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have documented the dependence of the mri growth rates on the initial , unknown , magnetic fields .",
    "since we ca nt yet afford both high spatial resolution and multi - group neutrino transport , we have opted for the latter , since no calculation performed to date has had this central feature . given our choice , we are still able to perform evolutions for not only tens of milliseconds , but for @xmath121 second and to witness the full panoply of dynamical phases .    in  [ general ] , we discuss the overall physical context , motivate our approach to the simulations portrayed , and review the simple physics of flux compression and winding , as well as the basics of the mri .",
    "we also describe many of the relevant timescales of the problem , all of which we argue are short compared with the time available in the explosion phase .",
    "this motivates the idea that a quasi - steady state engine is established and maintained .",
    "furthermore , we present qualitative discussions of the anticipated dependence of the jet power on spin rate and of the free energy from differential motion available to power the mhd engine .",
    "the latter is continuously fed by equatorial accretion during the early phases of bipolar explosion . in ",
    "[ setup ] , we present our computational setup and the parameters of the simulations we describe . in  [ results ] , we go on to describe and detail our simulation results and the phenomenology and morphology of the resultant blasts . we discuss the magnetic tower phenomenon , the poloidal and toroidal field distributions , the emergence of the jet and its collimation , the weak sausage instability , and the power density distributions . in  [ period ]",
    ", we discuss the magnitude and evolution of the spin rates and the free energy of differential rotation .",
    "we also explore the initial spin - rate dependence of the latter .",
    "section [ energy ] presents estimates of the derived jet powers and explosion energies and we conclude in  [ conclusion ] with both a summary of our central results and speculations on their wider astrophysical import .",
    "a progenitor core will have initial rotational and magnetic field profiles . magnetic torques and wind mass loss during the pre - collapse evolution of the star will help determine both these distributions .",
    "yet despite recent detailed efforts to model supernova progenitors ( e.g. , heger , woosley , & spruit 2005 ; hirschi ,  meynet ,  &  maeder 2004,2005 ) , we still have no reliable constraints on the spin or magnetic structures of the white - dwarf - like core that collapses when achieving the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "for instance , the predictions for the spin period , @xmath13 , of the chandrasekhar core vary from @xmath121.5 seconds to @xmath1250 seconds .",
    "this involves a range in the possible initial rotational kinetic energies of @xmath12@xmath14 .",
    "there is a similarly wide range of predictions for the magnitudes of the pre - collapse toroidal and poloidal fields and there are no predictions for 3d structures that are consistent with maxwell s equations .",
    "however , if the initial spin rate and angular momentum are large , and the mri ( or dynamo action in 3d ) occurs in the protoneutron star after bounce , then the resulting magnetic energy will be expected to exponentiate to saturation values that are in rough equipartition with the rotational free energy in the post - bounce differential motion . the growth of b - field energy due to the mri instability feeds off the free energy available in differential rotation , which is the difference between the rotational kinetic energy and the kinetic energy for solid - body rotation at the same total angular momentum .",
    "for example , shibata et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find that the mri saturates in the core - collapse context at magnetic energies that are very roughly 10% of the rotational energy .",
    "the degree to which the free energy is close to the total rotational energy itself depends upon the magnitude and distribution of the angular - velocity and density gradients .",
    "in particular , if the post - bounce core , which may contain a lot of the rotational energy , is in near solid - body rotation , and most of the shear is in an outer fraction of the mass ( albeit with larger moment arms ) , then a smaller fraction of the total rotational energy will be available to pump up the magnetic energy by the mri",
    ". this fraction could be only 10% , but might be 10%@xmath150% .",
    "for instance , the work of ott et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggests that progenitor cores with a fast @xmath13 of 2.34 seconds , can have rotational free energies at @xmath12200 milliseconds ( ms ) after bounce that range from @xmath122 to @xmath1212 bethes , depending upon progenitor mass and model .",
    "progenitor cores with slower @xmath13s of @xmath1210 seconds can have free energies ( at the same epoch ) that range from @xmath120.1 to @xmath120.2 bethes , while those with a slow @xmath13 of @xmath1250 seconds can have rotational free energies of only @xmath120.03 bethes .",
    "hence , depending upon the initial spin profile , the free energy available in differential rotation to be tapped to generate strong magnetic fields and mhd jets varies from insignificance to supernova and hypernova magnitudes .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the consequences for supernova theory of rapid initial rotation that should lead to strong magnetic fields and mhd - jet - driven explosions .",
    "we envision initial @xmath13s less than @xmath124 seconds , but focus for specificity on a @xmath13 of 2 seconds .",
    "such rapid spin rates may or may not obtain , or may obtain rarely and/or only in the hypernova context , but this is not our concern here . since with our modest number of grid points (  [ setup ] ) we can not fully resolve the mri ( see  [ intro ] ) , we hypothesize ( and calculate ) that the mri growth rates are sufficiently fast that within 100 - 200 milliseconds after bounce the resulting mhd jet structure will stabilize on longer - term secular evolution times , such as the accretion and neutrino cooling times ( 0.5 - 10 seconds ) , and will lose track of the initial b - field configuration . in this way , to a reasonable approximation , the structure , hydrodynamic flow , rotational profiles , and jet power will settle into a long - term evolution that depends most centrally only on the initial spin and thermodynamic profiles , and not on the initial b - fields ( at least , not very much ) . such should be a consequence of quick exponential growth to saturation .",
    "this ansatz motivates our choices of the initial poloidal and toroidal fields (  [ setup ] ) ; these are set to lead by flux compression and rotational field winding to final b - fields whose magnitudes roughly approximate those expected due to the mri at and around saturation . for a @xmath13 of 2 seconds , the resulting toroidal fields between @xmath1210 kilometers ( km ) and @xmath12100 km turn out to be very roughly @xmath15 gauss ( g ) . in ",
    "[ saturation ] , we provide a very approximate analytic connection between period and saturation b - field .    since flux freezing , field winding on infall , field winding after infall , and amplification due to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , of both poloidal and toroidal field components , are of interest , we next provide short discussions of each in turn , with a focus on the relevant timescales and approximate magnitudes .",
    "none of this is original , but we include it for general context . note that the various timescales all scale with the rotational period .",
    "hence , in the case of rapid rotation , all the relevant processes are accelerated and should lead to a jet - driven explosion that achieves a quasi - steady state on a  short \" timescale .",
    "after the asides in  [ amp ] ,  [ mri ] , and  [ saturation ] on order - of - magnitude estimates , we describe in  [ setup ] our computational and initial model setup , and then transition in  [ results ] to a detailed discussion of our simulation results",
    ".      rotational winding converts / stretches poloidal field into toroidal field .",

    "( [ wind_after ] ) , @xmath18 is the time , @xmath19 is the local spin period , and @xmath9 is the corresponding angular frequency .",
    "( [ wind_after ] ) suggests that each turn leads to a boost in @xmath11 near @xmath20 and that growth is linear in @xmath18 .",

    "however , if @xmath31 seconds , this ratio is ten times larger .",
    "core collapse leads to matter compression .",
    "magnetic flux conservation would then amplify both the toroidal and the poloidal fields .",
    "the magnitude of the compression is @xmath32 . with @xmath33 g @xmath34 and @xmath35 g @xmath34 ,",
    "if we combine the prescription for winding on infall with flux compression , assuming that the collapse is homologous ( @xmath37 ) , we find @xmath38 this expression is within a factor of two of the product of flux compression and winding ( eq .",
    "[ wind ] ) on infall taken separately . given the parameters above",
    ", flux compression yields a factor of @xmath12@xmath14 and winding a factor of a few ( again , for an initial period of @xmath39 seconds ) .",
    "note that the winding amplifies only the toroidal component , while flux compression amplifies both @xmath11 and @xmath40 .",
    "flux compression alone takes a toroidal field from @xmath41 g to @xmath42 g and a poloidal field from @xmath43 g ( @xmath44 ) to @xmath41 g ( @xmath40 ) . using eq .",
    "( [ wind_after ] ) , and starting with a @xmath40 of @xmath45 g , we can derive the time to achieve a given change in the toroidal field due solely to flux winding : @xmath46 if the initial fields are not very large , winding by itself , and not aided by the mri or dynamo action in 3d , can require a long time to achieve dynamically interesting field strengths ( @xmath1210@xmath47 g ) .",
    "it is , nevertheless , a very important process in rotational supernovae , particularly if the mri or a dynamo can deliver after bounce and on exponential timescales high values of the poloidal field .      in local linear mode analysis , one can derive a characteristic dispersion relation that depends on the rotational shear ( @xmath48 ) , the magnitude of the b - field , and the brunt - visl frequency ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; pessah & psaltis 2005 ; akiyama et al .",

    ", the free energy is calculated by determining the kinetic energy of the pns , and subtracting from it the kinetic energy for the same object if in solid - body rotation at the same total angular momentum .",
    "the density profiles in the two realizations are assumed to be the same , so this procedure is only approximate .",
    "nevertheless , in this manner we obtain a useful measure of the energy available to the mhd jet .",
    "as the figure indicates , the free energy available to power the jets in all of the @xmath31-second models exceeds @xmath139 ergs ( 3 bethes ) .",
    "furthermore , models such as m15b11dp2a1h that explode weakly evolve to increase the free energy available , sometimes to large values that can approach the hypernova regime .",
    "it would seem that at @xmath13 = 2 seconds , there is ample energy to power a supernova .    however , model m15b11dp4a1h has significantly less free energy with which to maintain a respectable mhd jet explosion .",
    "this energy is even less than the 25% one might have naively expected and is due to the fact that the feedback of rotation on the dynamics of collapse and accretion results in a less differentially - rotating pns and in a slightly different density ( mass ) profile . from this , we conclude that the @xmath140-dependence of the mhd jet mechanism may be a stronger function of @xmath140 than simple scaling arguments would suggest ; the viability of the mhd jet mechanism may be a stiff function of @xmath140 , and may drop off quite fast with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "this possibility puts a premium on precise ( more precise ) initial models and advanced simulation capabilities .",
    "the most important information from our simulations is the energetics of the explosions .",
    "the jets carry kinetic , internal , gravitational , and magnetic energies .",

    "figure [ e_expl ] also portrays the integrated  net gain \" ( bethe & wilson 1985 ) due to neutrino heating in the outer mantle . this number gives a sense of the contribution of neutrino heating to the explosive energy budget .",
    "we see that neutrinos can contribute some multiple of @xmath145 ergs , most of which in model m15b11dp2a1h is used to lift the ejecta out of the deep gravitational well . in these models ,",
    "neutrinos do not , without the mhd jet , lead to explosion in themselves .    finally , fig .",
    "[ vmax ] portrays the evolution of the maximum speed in the ejecta as a function of time .",
    "the maximum is @xmath1230000@xmath155000 km s@xmath87 .",
    "this is high , but not near the speed of light . if relativistic speeds are ever achieved in the context of rapidly rotating core collapse , this must happen after the jet head achieves a distance of 5000 km and after a post - bounce time of one second , perhaps long after .",
    "in fact , from the analysis of our results viewed collectively , we see no reason that relativistic speeds would obtain as long as a protoneutron star remains at the core and does not collapse into a black hole through the requisite extended phase of mass accretion .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the first 2d , rotating , multi - group , radiation magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) simulations of supernova core collapse , bounce , and explosion .",
    "these calculations cover the longest stretch of physical time and incorporate the most physics ever attempted for mhd simulations in the supernova context .",
    "moreover , many of the features and results we find are new .",
    "our focus has been on the evolution , strength , and role of magnetic stresses and on the creation and propagation of mhd jets in the context of rapid rotation .",
    "we find that a quasi - steady state can be quickly established during which a well - collimated mhd jet is maintained by continuous pumping of power from the differentially rotating core .",
    "if the initial spin period of the progenitor core is @xmath122 seconds , the free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving pns is more than adequate to power a supernova explosion , and may be enough for a hypernova .",
    "we speculate that general relativity ( gr ) , by making the core more compact and thereby leading to more rapid post - bounce spin rates , will amplify the power and energy of the mhd jet beyond what we see in our newtonian simulations .",
    "gr may also enable progenitors with initial spin periods slightly higher than @xmath122 seconds to generate mhd jets with supernova potential .",
    "given this , initial core periods up to @xmath123 seconds may lead to strong mhd - powered supernova . including the effects of small - scale dissipation of heat by the mri ( tqb ) might relax this period bound somewhat , enabling progenitors with higher initial periods near 4@xmath15 seconds to launch strong jets with supernova energies .",
    "however , we infer from our suite of simulations that the mhd jet phenomenon is a very stiff function of @xmath140 .",
    "note that , due to the strong gravitational wave bursts that are signatures of the bounce of rapidly rotating cores , the associated supernovae may be centrally relevant to ongoing efforts to detect gravitational waves ( ott et al",
    ". 2004,2007 ) .",
    "we find that the jet emerges first along a core around the rotation axis , when the magnetic stresses behind the shock approach the local gas pressures .",
    "it is the power density , not the total power , that is important in overcoming the accretion ram and punching through the local accreta .",
    "the jet is well collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop stresses , and maintains a small opening angle during our simulations .",
    "hence , it does not experience the blanford - payne centrifugal effect to any great degree .",
    "furthermore , we see evidence of sausage / pinch instabilities in the emerging jet stream , but otherwise the jet settles into a very steady pattern .",
    "neutrino heating is sub - dominant in the rapidly rotating models we explored , but can contribute 10@xmath125% to the final explosion energy .",
    "hence , we surmise that for a range of rapid rotation rates a hybrid magneto - neutrino mechanism is possible . moreover , and intriguingly ,",
    "even though as in models m15b11dp4a1h and m15b10dp2a1h the mhd jet might be weak and the supernova explosion might have a different origin ( neutrino , acoustic ? ) , our simulations suggest that the supernova explosion can be followed by a secondary mhd jet event , itself a weak explosion .",
    "such a secondary explosion , a reasonable consequence of modest , but not rapid , rotation , may accompany most supernovae , but due to the anticipated weakness when the rotation rates are low , to date this feature may have gone unnoticed .",
    "however , the jet / counter - jet structure seen in cas a ( hwang et al . 2004 ) may be such a secondary explosion .",
    "a theme that emerges from our simulations with rapid rotation is that for all cases in which either the  millisecond magnetar model \" ( usov 1992 ; thompson ,  chang ,  &  quataert 2004 ; bucciantini et al .",
    "2006 ; metzger , thompson , & quataert 2006 ) or the collapsar model ( macfadyan & woosley 1999 ) of grbs or x - ray flashes may be relevant , since both these scenarios require rapid rotation , the first manifestation of such rotation will be the emergence of an mhd jet during the earlier pns phase we have addressed in this paper .",
    "this implies , for instance , that the relativistic jets from the later collapsar / black - hole phase must be preceded by a precursor jet of some significance ( dessart et al .",
    ", in preparation ; see also wheeler , meier , & wilson 2002 and wang & meszaros 2007 ) .",
    "this delay could be seconds and is the time it takes the inner core to accrete to the critical , gr - unstable configuration that dynamically gives birth to a black hole . before the formation of the black hole",
    ", there is more than enough spin angular momentum and free energy of differential rotation in the pns to generate and power a magnetic tower explosion .",
    "such a jet may or may not be more energetic in aggregate than the grb jet that follows it later , but it wo nt , if we are correct , contribute to the ultrarelativistic component of stellar death which may be the central feature of grbs .",
    "we have included in our model suite two simulations , m15b10dp2a1f ( 180@xmath106 ) and m15b10dp2a1h ( 90@xmath106 ) , which allow us to gauge the effect of rapid rotation on the sasi .",
    "we find that rapid rotation tends to mute it ; the sasi takes longer to develop and achieves smaller amplitudes when it does .",
    "the magnetic fields in these  b10 \" runs were too small to effect the sasi more than rotation , given @xmath31 seconds . however , these conclusions should be considered preliminary until 3d simulations with good input physics and sophisticated radiative transfer are performed .",
    "our simulations and estimates suggest that whatever the initial rotational and magnetic conditions in the progenitor core , the mri , dynamo action , and rotational winding alone should completely alter the magnitude and multipolarity structure of the pulsar or magnetar b - field that is formed in the supernova context .",
    "even if the spin rate is low , convection and the sasi will drag and twist the flux - frozen field .",
    "mere flux conservation on collapse , what has been the default explanation for pulsar fields for decades , ca nt be the whole , or , perhaps , even a major part of the story .",
    "there is too much dynamics during the pns / supernova phase not to have left a profound mark on what remains .",
    "that said , it may be that the initial inner core field is amplified by flux freezing on collapse and is then afterwards preserved by the fact that this inner core is not in strong differential motion ( fig .",
    "[ mod2p_omega ] ) .",
    "the outer region between @xmath1210 km and @xmath12150 km may then experience all the winding , twisting and mri or dynamo amplification during a transient supernova phase , after which , with the establishment of solid - body rotation for the whole core , the field , in what is now the outer crust of the young neutron star , assumes more modest values",
    ". these may be lower than the values frozen in the inner core , may be higher , or much higher ( magnetar ? ) .",
    "furthermore , the field in the outer crust will experience ohmic dissipation on timescales , which might be short ( days to years ) , determined in part by the temperatures there .",
    "these temperatures , and their profiles , are determined by the dynamics during the collapse and supernova phases .",
    "so , one is prompted to ask : can there be a transient phase of high b - field / rotation that is responsible for a supernova , that as the rotational shear subsides and the core spins down transitions to canonical pulsar b - field and spin values ?",
    "can the high b - fields decay due to ohmic dissipation in the crust , after being generated during the hot cool - down phase ? what is the progenitor dependence of all this ? what determines whether a canonical pulsar or a magnetar is left ?",
    "whatever the answers to these questions , they are determined in no small measure during the dynamical supernova phase .",
    "and that phase , if the progenitor core is rapidly rotating , involves mhd jets and bipolar explosions .      1 .   that the presence of the stalled shock changes the evolution to explosion dramatically",
    "the confinement it enforces delays explosion and enables the b - field to grow to explosive conditions ; * that the above also makes the accreting matter responsible for collimating the mhd jet , and that hoop stresses are sub - dominant in this regard . * and , moveover , that the blandford - payne centrifugal phenomenon is suppressed by the accreta , leading to a  magnetic tower \" explosion that is little aided by the centrifugal whip effect .",

    "<S> we find that a quasi - steady state can be quickly established after bounce , during which a well - collimated mhd jet is maintained by continuous pumping of power from the differentially rotating core . if the initial spin period of the progenitor core is @xmath0 2 seconds , the free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving protoneutron star is adequate to power a supernova explosion , and may be enough for a hypernova . </S>",
    "<S> the jets are well collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop stresses , and maintain a small opening angle . </S>",
    "<S> we see evidence of sausage instabilities in the emerging jet stream . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino heating is sub - dominant in the rapidly rotating models we explore , but can contribute 10@xmath125% to the final explosion energy . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations suggest that even in the case of modest or slow rotation , a supernova explosion might be followed by a secondary , weak mhd jet explosion , which , because of its weakness may to date have gone unnoticed in supernova debris . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we suggest that the generation of a non - relativistic mhd precursor jet during the early protoneutron star / supernova phase is implicit in both the collapsar and  millisecond magnetar \" models of grbs . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - d , multi - group , rapidly rotating rmhd simulations we describe here are a start along the path towards more realistic simulations of the possible role of magnetic fields in some of nature s most dramatic events . </S>"
