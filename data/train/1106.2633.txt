    "the polymerization starts from a lennard - jones liquid , where 215 beads are chosen randomly to behave as `` radical '' sites .",
    "each radical bead is allowed to connect to a free and nearest neighbor with a strong covalent bond .",
    "the radical sites are then transferred to the new connected beads , allowing thus the growth of all chains . if no monomers are near the radical , no fene bond is created .",

    "triaxial tensile test conditions were employed @xcite .",
    "the samples were subjected to a sequence of deformation - relaxation steps , composed of ( i ) a rescaling of the simulation box in the tensile direction ( @xmath17 in our case so that the true strain @xmath18 ) , whereas the two other dimensions remain unchanged , followed by ( ii ) an md step in the nvt ensemble .",

    "three main regimes can be distinguished : ( i ) elastic , ( ii ) viscoelastic , and ( ii ) drawing regime , which occurs at constant stress . in the elastic regime ,",
    "the increase of deformation will slightly shift the bead positions from their local energy minima , resulting in reversible behavior .",
    "this regime is limited to a very low strain 0.001 as demonstrated by schnell  @xcite . in the viscoelastic regime",
    ", stress is relaxed by inter - chain sliding .",
    "this stage is limited by a strong drop of stress .",
    "when a critical deformation is reached , cavities will nucleate and then part of the stored elastic energy is released as free surfaces open up .",
    "note that the strain hardening regime is not shown in figure [ naf_displacement.fig](a ) , since it occurs at larger strains when the entanglement network of chains and fibrils becomes stretched @xcite .",
    "the detection of cavity nucleation could be performed visually on snapshots that are regularly stored during the course of the tensile test .",
    "however , small cavities in a three dimensional sample can be delicate to observe .",
    "therefore , a more versatile indicator is needed .",
    "the non - affine displacement ( nad ) is the perfect candidate for such observation and has been successfully used to monitor local plastic activity in 2d amorphous lennard - jones packings under athermal quasistatic deformation  @xcite .",
    "note that nad fluctuations can not find their origin in the thermal motion of atoms since , in the framework of this paper , specimens are maintained well below their glass transition temperature ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "moreover , the nad can be used as a routine tool and it starts to increase locally , in the early stages of cavity nucleation , even before the cavity could be observed visually on a snapshot of the sample .    the non - affine displacement ( @xmath22 ) is defined as the difference between the mean displacement of a bead @xmath23 during time @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , and the mean displacement it would experience if the deformation were perfectly affine , _",

    "the nad exhibits a peak .",
    "beads that exhibit the largest nad are those which belong to the surface of the cavity ( see figure  [ naf_displacement.fig](c ) ) .",
    "figure [ naf_displacement.fig](b ) shows the evolution of the nad distribution for several deformations . before cavitation , increasing the deformation shifts the distribution tail to larger nad until the very moment at which the growth of a cavity occurs , which is associated with very large values of nad ( see figure  [ naf_displacement.fig](c ) ) .",
    "a threshold for nad magnitude has been defined : if @xmath32 at the yielding point , the bead @xmath23 is said to belong to the cavity surface .",
    "this threshold is used to identify the `` cavity beads '' in order to follow some of their local properties .",
    "the position of the cavity is defined as the centre of mass of these `` cavity beads '' .",
    "after cavitation , the distribution returns to a narrower shape .",
    "note that the nad distribution broadens even before the stress drop in the stress - strain curve , due to the nucleation of the cavity . in the following sections , nad will be used as a quantitative tool for investigating the possible correlations with other microstructural or mechanical properties , such as voronoi volume , hydrostatic stress , local density and local moduli .",
    "in this section , we will attempt to correlate nad fluctuations with some local properties measured at the scale of a single `` atom '' ( voronoi volume and stress per atom ) , and properties averaged on the scale of a few particle diameters ( chain end density and bulk modulus ) .",
    "the concept of free volume has been extensively used to explain many specific properties of supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "free volume is defined as the volume in excess compared to an ideal disordered atomic configuration of maximum density .",
    "one of the simplest way to compute free volume on a local scale ( and to avoid the ambiguity of the above definition ) is the voronoi tessellation , which uniquely assigns a polygonal volume to each bead , formed by intersecting the planes bisecting the lines between different bead centres . in order to determine whether local fluctuations of free volume ( or voronoi volume ) favour the nucleation of a cavity , we used the voro++ routine to calculate the volume associated to each bead .

    "the corresponding points appear to be a randomly chosen subset of the total sample .",
    "this absence of correlation may appear surprising , as the presence of a high local stress is often expected to result in plastic deformation .",
    "note however that this result is consistent with a recent study @xcite which showed no correlation between atomic stresses and shear yielding in polymers . in an analogous way ,",
    "a previous study on sheared glasses @xcite also failed to find a direct correlation between local stresses and the relevant local plastic deformation ( shear transformations in that case ) .",
    "it may be , however , that a more coarse grained characterization is necessary to identify such correlations , and that the cavitation events are the result of a local heterogeneity that extends beyond the scale of individual beads . in order to assess this hypothesis ,",
    "we describe briefly in the next section studies performed on density fields defined at a more coarse grained scale .    .",
    "no clear trend for a correlation can be established .",
    "the values corresponding to the beads that surround the cavity labeled by the symbol @xmath33 are randomly dispersed , thus preventing one to identify any specific correlation for these beads . ]",
    "the opening of a cavity under strain can be seen as a collective event , that involves at least those atoms that will form the cavity `` skin '' at the end of the process .",
    "the corresponding mechanical instability may therefore be the result of some density anomaly that extends over a region larger than a single atom size or voronoi cell .",
    "we therefore have also explored the properties of our polymer system on such a coarse grained scale by defining continuous fields from the atomic positions .",
    "various possibilities are available for such a coarse graining procedure @xcite ; here we choose the simplest one , which consists in computing the densities on a regular grid by assigning to each grid node the atoms that belong to a fixed `` voxel '' volume around this node .",
    "the voxel size is taken in the range 5@xmath2 to 7@xmath2 , which was shown in similar studies @xcite to permit a good description in terms of continuous fields ( with about 120 monomers per voxel ) while preserving the locality and possible spatial heterogeneity of the variables under consideration .",
    "we have attempted to coarse grain and to correlate with the appearance of cavities two of the densities examined previously at the atomic level , namely the density of chain ends and the density of monomers . the local density field is defined as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of beads within a voxel @xmath23 , and @xmath46 is the voronoi volume of the bead j that is included in the voxel @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ local bulk density and chain end density.fig](a ) shows the evolution of this local density with strain , and compares the average value with the value observed in the vicinity of the cavity .",
    "these data show that the local density in the vicinity of the cavity follows the mean value until a deformation of @xmath47 .",
    "although cavitation does not occur until @xmath48 , the local volume begins to decrease earlier ( see inset ) .",
    "this observed trend can be interpreted by the fact that cavitation starts earlier than the drop of stress in the stress - strain - curve .",
    "this `` pre - cavitation '' behavior can be interpreted as resulting from a dynamical equilibrium between the elastic energy and the free surface energy of cavity with relatively small radius .",
    "this situation remains stable until the cavity reaches a critical radius ( roughly estimated @xmath49 ) , beyond which the size of the cavity increases rapidly .",
    "the spatial distribution of the local density at @xmath50 , just before the opening the cavity is shown in part ( b ) of figure [ local bulk density and chain end density.fig ] .",
    "the lowest density spots are far from the expected position of the cavity , but a low density can be noticed in the cavity vicinity . in general , we have checked that a systematic decrease in density prior to cavitation is specific of the points that are located in the vicinity of the emerging cavity .",
    "other points may display fluctuations in their values of the density , but these fluctuations remain uncorrelated with cavitation events . after the cavity nucleation ,",
    "the low density regions that did not form cavities release their excess free volume introduced by the triaxial deformation condition .",
    "therefore the local density of such regions return to values similar to regions that are not involved in the cavitation . in conclusion ,",
    "local loss of density should be seen rather as a consequence than as a cause of cavity nucleation .    as was mentioned above ( in section [ voronoivolumefluctuations.subsec ] ) , the free volume was found to be correlated with the bead connectivity .",
    "chain ends exhibit a higher voronoi volume compared to other monomers , and a lower density of beads could be expected where a higher density of chain ends is present .",
    "we therefore define a local density of chain ends @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of chain ends within a voxel i , and @xmath54 is the volume of the voxel .",
    "figure [ local bulk density and chain end density.fig](c ) shows that , at this level of coarse graining , the spatial distribution of chain ends is uncorrelated with the local density of beads and also with the cavity position .",
    "this indicates that the modification of the packing density by the presence chain ends is insignificant .",
    "summarizing , the coarse grained density of beads exhibits a limited success as a predictor for cavity formation , as its evolution can be correlated with the formation of a cavity only shortly before the event actually takes place . the coarse grained density of chain ends ,",
    "on the other hand , does not correlate well with the total density or with cavitation .",
    "our last attempt to identify a microstructural predictor for cavitation events is inspired by previous work on simple glassy systems under shear deformation , in which a low value of the shear moduli was identified as a good indicator for the occurrence of the relevant local plastic events , shear transformation zones @xcite . here",
    "the relevant events involve a local dilatation of the material which eventually gives rise to a cavity , and points to the local bulk modulus as a possible predictor .",
    "local heterogeneity in the elastic properties of glasses is now a well documented feature , with a number of studies having shown that the moduli defined at intermediate scales ( of the order of 10 atomic sizes ) are those of an isotropic but heterogeneous material . at such scales ,",
    "a typical glassy sample can be described as a consisting of coexisting `` hard '' and `` soft '' regions .",
    "this behavior is independent of the precise method which is used to define the coarse grained elastic constant , which may involve either the use of statistical mechanical formulae at a local scale @xcite , or exploiting the linear relationship between coarse grained stress and strain field @xcite . here",
    "we present results for the local bulk modulus obtained from a third approach , originally introduced by p. sollich _ et .",
    "@xcite , which has the advantage of being easily implemented at a reduced computational cost .",
    "the method can be summarized as follows : one first defines a coarse graining volume as a fictive shape that encapsulates a number of beads .",
    "the shape was chosen spherical in order to reduce any potential boundary effects , and the radius equal to 3.5 particle diameters , consistent with the typical coarse graining scales used in other methods @xcite .",
    "the entire sample is then deformed affinely ( in this case using a uniform dilation of all bead coordinates ) .",
    "after this homogeneous deformation , all beads are kept frozen , except those contained in the coarse graining volume which are allowed to fluctuate in a constant volume , constant temperature molecular dynamics trajectory ( here we perform a trajectory at a rather low temperature , @xmath55 ) . the increase in the hydrostatic stress @xmath56 within the spherical volume @xmath1 is obtained from the virial stress formula , and the local modulus @xmath57 can be defined by dividing this stress by the imposed increase in volumetric strain @xmath58 :    @xmath59        in order to improve the accuracy on @xmath57 , it has then been averaged over a dozen expansion tests within the domain @xmath60 .",
    "a sequence of deformation ( isotropic expansion ) and relaxation steps is applied over the sample , the gauge volume @xmath61 and @xmath56 are measured after each step .",
    "the expansion is limited to a very low deformation amount since the measurement is restricted in the elastic regime only . substituting the @xmath58 by",
    "its definition @xmath62 leads to another form of equation ( [ bulk_modulus1 ] ) : @xmath63 or equivalently @xmath64 where @xmath61 and @xmath56 are integrated along the deformation trajectory from @xmath65 to @xmath28 .",
    "this method allows us to obtain an accurate determination of @xmath57 in the linear regime by fitting the data obtained for @xmath56=f(@xmath66 ) .",
    "this procedure was applied along each tensile deformation trajectory , for positions of the center of the coarse graining volume distributed on a regular grid .",
    "figure [ compare_bulk_modulus distribution.fig ] compares the statistical distributions of the local bulk modulus at different strain levels .",
    "the plotted distributions are shifted by their mean values to facilitate comparison of their shapes .",
    "curves remain symmetrical and gaussian , whatever the applied strain before cavitation . as the deformation increases ,",
    "the distribution will become slightly narrower .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the trend described in the previous sections , that the polymeric system tends to homogenize its local stress under an applied deformation .",
    "the mean value of the local bulk modulus ( see inset ) decreases continuously as the deformation increases and more free volume is introduced in the system .    in order to investigate the spatial distribution of the local bulk modulus",
    ", two - dimensional slices in a plane perpendicular to the tensile direction were taken at the level at which the cavity is observed .",
    "figure [ bulk_modulus_slices.fig ] shows a sequence of such bulk modulus cartographies that are captured along the deformation trajectory .",
    "each slice corresponds to one of the blue markers on the stress strain curve ( first plot in figure [ bulk_modulus_slices.fig ] ) .",
    "the nonaffine vectors describing the formation of a cavity are also plotted on each map .",
    "as can be seen , the local bulk modulus fluctuates between high and low values at each strain , and the position at which the cavity appears corresponds to one of the low bulk modulus sites identified in the starting configuration .",
    "when the deformation increases , an extremely low value of bulk modulus appears in the expected position of cavity , as in slices ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "the lower value indicated here is not only a local minimum in the plane of the figure , but instead corresponds to the lowest value for the entire sample .    in the light of this strong correlation between nad and elastic modulus",
    ", the cavitation process in glassy polymers can be described in the following manner : the polymeric system exhibits some fluctuations in the local elastic bulk modulus . as the deformation progresses , the statistical distribution of the bulk modulus changes : the mean value decreases , but the contrast of spatial distribution is conserved . at relatively high strain , one of the zones that initially displayed a low bulk modulus will reach an anomalous value , resulting in a favorable location for the subsequent growth of a cavity .",
    "we will now investigate whether this behavior should be described as deterministic ( the cavity systematically forms in a particular zone ) or rather statistical ( the cavity forms randomly in one of the zones with a low modulus ) process .",
    "to this end , the same system was subjected to three tensile tests with different tensile directions x , y and z. the positions at which cavitation takes place were recorded and compared after each test .",
    "figure [ cavity_position_vs_tensile_direction.fig](a ) shows that , for the same initial configuration , cavities nucleate in different zones .",
    "the same behaviour was also found for several systems with different temperatures .",
    "the cavities systematically nucleate in zones that are characterized by a low modulus in the initial state , however the specific site at which it is observed depends on the deformation path and on the tensile direction .",
    "in this work the relationship between a cavitation event in a glassy polymer undergoing a tensile test and the local properties has been investigated with molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "several properties have been analyzed at two different length scales : the elementary scale of the monomer , and a coarse graining scale of 5 to 10 particle diameters .",
    "independent of the scale under consideration , we find that the density of monomers or the density of chain ends do not correlate with the subsequent appearance of a cavity .",
    "in contrast , the bulk modulus in the unstrained configuration displays fluctuations that can be directly related , in a statistical sense , to the appearance of a cavity at large deformations . note that very similar conclusions were reached by toepperwein and de pablo in a recent study that considered both homopolymers and composite systems @xcite .",
    "this situation resembles those observed in glassy materials under volume conserving shear , where a weak shear modulus indicates a tendency for plastic rearrangement .",

    "<S> the nucleation of cavities in a homogenous polymer under tensile strain is investigated in a coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulation . in order to establish a causal relation between local microstructure and the onset of cavitation , </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of some local properties is presented . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to common assumptions , the nucleation of a cavity is neither correlated to a local loss of density nor , to the stress at the atomic scale and nor to the chain ends density in the undeformed state . </S>",
    "<S> instead , a cavity in glassy polymers nucleates in regions that display a low bulk elastic modulus . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion allows one to predict the cavity position before the cavitation occurs . </S>",
    "<S> even if the localization of a cavity is not directly predictable from the initial configuration , the elastically weak zones identified in the initial state emerge as favorite spots for cavity formation .    </S>",
