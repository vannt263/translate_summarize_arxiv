    "in what is usually referred to as _ ghost imaging _ the coherent imaging of an object is achieved with incoherent light upon exploiting the spatial correlations between two light beams @xcite . the object interacts with one of the beams and an image of the object is built up by scanning the other beam .",
    "ghost imaging may be obtained either with classically correlated beams @xcite , as those obtained by splitting the light from a ( pseudo ) thermal source , or with entangled beams @xcite , as those obtained by parametric downconversion . in the latter case one",
    "may achieve in principle higher visibility .    for objects which modify only the amplitude of light an image may be obtained with a single spatially incoherent beam upon measuring the autocorrelation function in the far field , without the need of ghost imaging",
    "this is no longer possible when the object is also modifying the phase of the beam . in particular , it is of interest to investigate ghost imaging in the extreme case of pure phase objects , i.e. objects altering only the phase information carried by the beam .",
    "phase objects are also of intrinsic interest in quantum information processing , since they introduce reversible unitary operations .",
    "ghost imaging of pure phase objects has been extensively analyzed theoretically and experimentally using both classically or quantum correlated beams @xcite .",
    "related effects connected with ( nonlocal ) dispersion cancellation have been investigated as well , both in the temporal and the spatial domains @xcite . in this paper",
    "we suggest and demonstrate experimentally a scheme to achieve coherent nonlocal compensation / superposition of pure phase objects , also paving the way for the reconstruction of the overall phase function imposed to the two beams .",
    "our scheme is based on two - photon polarization and momentum entangled states , which are generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion and purified using a spatial light modulator .",
    "the same device is also used to introduce arbitrary phase functions on the two beams , which represent arbitrary phase objects . in our setup the insertion of a single phase object on one of the beams reduces the purity of the state and the amount of shared entanglement , whereas the original entanglement can be retrieved by adding a suitable phase object on the other beam .",
    "the image of both single or double phase objects can be thus obtained by scanning the coincidence counts on one of the two beams . as a possible application , we also suggest and demonstrate a protocol for quantum key distribution based on nonlocal phase compensation .    the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe in details our experimental setup and the properties of the two - photon entangled states that are generated . in section [",
    "s : dpi ] we analyze in some details phase imaging and nonlocal phase compensation of phase objects .",
    "finally , in section [ s : qkd ] , we suggest a quantum key distribution protocol based on phase compensation and report about its experimental implementation .",

    "[ exp_setup ] ) .",
    "experimentally , some care must be taken in order to spatially superimpose the @xmath16 and @xmath17 downconversion beams , so that the angular distribution @xmath7 is actually the same for the two components of the entangled state . from eq .",

    "these angular dependent terms are responsible for decoherence of polarization qubit and should be removed in order to obtain an effective source of entangled pairs  @xcite . in our apparatus ,",
    "a one dimensional programmable spatial light modulator ( slm ) is placed on the signal and the idler paths ( see fig . [ exp_setup ] ) in order to insert the phase functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the first term is used for purification , i.e to remove the angle - dependent phase - shift , @xmath26 , thus realizing a reliable polarization - entanglement source  @xcite , whereas the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the phase - objects we insert on the signal and the idler arm , respectively . notice that spatial light modulators have been recently used in imaging also for a different purpose , i.e that of imposing a set of known random phase distributions @xcite and",
