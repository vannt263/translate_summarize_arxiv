    "by contrast , the smallest deviation between pic / mcc and both fluid modelling results for the maximum of the ion density in helium is obtained at the lowest pressure of 10pa .",

    "[ fig : vergleich0p25he ] ]    shows the spatial variation of the first four moments of the evdf , namely density , mean energy , particle flux and energy flux of electrons together with the electric field , the ionization rate and the electron heating rate , as obtained by the fluid models ddan and dda53 as well as the pic / mcc simulations .",
    "the density of fast electrons with energies higher than @xmath6 obtained by pic / mcc simulations is additionally depicted in figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25he]b . in general , both fluid models are able to reproduce most discharge features qualitatively and quantitatively fairly well .",
    "larger differences can particularly be observed in the mean electron energy ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25he]c ) .",
    "both fluid approaches overestimate the mean electron energy in the plasma bulk region by about 2030% .",
    "a large discrepancy can also be observed in the mean electron energy obtained by ddan and dda53 in the cathode region close to @xmath8 .",
    "however , this is of minor importance for the present situation because no emission of secondary electrons is considered and hence the electron density in the sheath region is extremely low ( @xmath27{m^{-3}}$ ] ) .",
    "note that this is also the reason why no pic / mcc data for the mean electron energy @xmath28 is available for that region .",
    "the overestimation of the mean electron energy in the bulk plasma by the fluid models is caused by the fact that , particularly at lower pressures , highly energetic electrons significantly contribute to the ionization budget . at the same time",
    ", the density of these fast electrons ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25he]b ) is too low to have any effect on the mean electron energy .",
    "since the ionization rate coefficient used in the fluid description depends on the mean electron energy only , ( see section  [ sec : inp_phys ] ) , a higher mean energy is enforced by the need to deliver the predefined current .",
    "this lack of a precise description of electrons contributing to the electron generation but not to the mean electron energy also causes a more localized profile of the ionization rate determined by the fluid models compared to the pic / mcc results ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25he]e ) .",
    "another important difference between the fluid modelling results and the pic / mcc solution concerns the obtained sheath width .",
    "particularly the spatial profiles of the electric field ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25he]a ) and the fluxes ( figures  [ fig : vergleich0p25he]f , g ) show that both fluid models overestimate the sheath width by about 5% .",
    "this difference causes the spatial shift between the pic / mcc and fluid results , e.g. , for the maximum of the heating rate in the sheath / plasma transition region ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25he]d ) .",
    "apart from this , the results of ddan and dda53 for the electron heating rate as well as the particle and energy fluxes are in good agreement with the pic / mcc results .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the fluxes @xmath25 and @xmath26 are highly transient quantities which makes the direct comparison of results obtained by different methods at a certain time difficult .",

    "[ fig : vergleich0p25ar ] ]    the corresponding spatial behaviour of the electric field , electron density , mean energy , heating and ionization rate , electron particle and energy fluxes for argon at 20pa and the instant @xmath7 is shown in figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25ar ] .",
    "the main difference to the situation for helium is that here only the novel fluid description for electrons , ddan , is able to predict most of the macroscopic quantities with the same accuracy as in helium .",
    "most likely , the presence of the ramsauer minimum in argon causes the occurrence of nonlocal transport effects which can be captured by the ddan approach but not by the classical model dda53 due to the coinciding particle and energy transport of the electrons induced by the assumption of a maxwellian evdf  @xcite .",
    "the divergences between the results of dda53 and pic / mcc particularly affect the electron heating rate ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25ar]d ) and the energy flux  ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25ar]g ) where large differences in the spatial profiles can be observed .",
    "in contrast , the fluid model ddan including a consistent description of electron energy transport , provides a comparatively good prediction of these quantities when compared with the pic / mcc simulation results .",
    "however , the comparison of the pic / mcc results for the spatial profile of the fast electron density ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25ar]b ) with the spatial profile of the ionization rate ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25ar]e ) indicates that highly energetic electrons predominantly determine the ionization rate , similar to the behaviour found in helium .",
    "hence , the marked differences between the results of ddan and the pic / mcc simulations for the spatial profiles of the mean electron energy ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25ar]c ) and the ionization rate ( figure  [ fig : vergleich0p25ar]e ) are again caused by the improper consideration of ionization in the plasma bulk induced by fast electrons .",
    "the approach introduced by rafatov  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for low - pressure dc glow discharges aiming at an enhanced description of nonlocal ionization by adding an additional source term was found to be not applicable for the modelling of ccrf discharges .",
    "the separate description of highly energetic electrons by the monte carlo collision method ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) could be a more promising extension of the present fluid model description to overcome the remaining shortcomings .",
    "note that the discrepancy between fluid and pic / mcc methods regarding the spatial distribution of the ionization rate drops with raising pressure due to the increase of the collisionality and the associated decrease of the impact of fast electrons .",
    "in the present work the applicability and the accuracy of two different fluid approaches for the analysis of low - pressure ccrf discharges were investigated by benchmarking them against pic / mcc simulations .",
    "the considered fluid methods comprise time - dependent particle and momentum balance equations for ions as well as a novel drift - diffusion approximation ( ddan ) and the classical drift - diffusion approximation with simplified energy transport coefficients ( dda53 ) for electrons , respectively . in order to assure the general validity of the findings and to provide a test bed for future studies ,",
    "simple ccrf discharge configurations in helium and argon at pressures ranging from 10 to 80pa were considered .",
    "main findings of the comparative studies are the following :    * results of the novel as well as the classical fluid model are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with macroscopic quantities derived from pic / mcc simulations for ccrf discharges in helium . here , the novel drift - diffusion approximation provides a slightly better prediction of the plasma density than the classical drift - diffusion approximation with deviations of less than 30% for the ddan model and 40% for the dda53 approach compared to pic / mcc results . * for argon , the classical fluid model fails to reproduce the discharge features predicted by pic / mcc simulations .",
    "in contrast , the novel drift - diffusion approximation maintains its applicability and reliability and provides a prediction of relevant plasma parameters with deviations of less than 30% compared to the pic / mcc simulation results .",
    "* at lower pressures both fluid models fail to correctly reproduce the spatial profile of the ionization rate .",
    "this is caused by the lack of an adequate description of highly energetic electrons which contribute to the ionization budget but not to the mean energy of electrons .",
    "future studies will address the questions how the influence of highly energetic electrons can be better included in the novel fluid modelling framework presented here and how plasma - boundary interactions can be described correctly .",
