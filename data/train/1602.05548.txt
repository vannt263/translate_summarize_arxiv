    "with the explosive growth of mobile multimedia traffic demand and number of mobile devices , the next - generation wireless networks face significant challenges in improving system capacity and guaranteeing users quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "cloud radio access networks ( c - rans ) present a promising approach to these challenges by curtailing both capital and operating expenditures for providing mobile multimedia applications , while providing high energy - efficiency and capacity @xcite@xcite . in c - rans , the traditional base station ( bs ) is decoupled into the distributed remote radio heads ( rrhs ) and the baseband unit ( bbu ) .",
    "antennas are equipped with rrhs to transmit / receive radio frequency ( rf ) signals , and bbus are clustered as a bbu pool in a centralized location with aggregating all bs computational resources , which provides large - scale processing and management functions for the signals transmitted / received from rrhs . with this architecture , mobile operators can easily expand and upgrade the network by deploying additional rrhs , and thus the corresponding operational costs can be greatly reduced .",
    "the heterogeneous cloud radio access network ( h - cran ) is regarded as a new paradigm to meet performance requirements of the fifth generation ( 5 g ) cellular system for mobile multimedia applications by incorporating cloud computing into heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) , in which the control and user planes are decoupled .",
    "the existing macro base station ( mbs ) that has been deployed in traditional cellular networks is used to alleviate capacity constraints over the fronthaul and provide seamless coverage with qos guarantees for users . in particular ,",
    "burst multimedia traffic and real - time multimedia traffic with low - bit transmit rate can be efficiently served by the mbs . for control signaling and system data broadcasting at mbss , it alleviates the capacity and time delay constraints in the fronthaul links between rrhs and the bbu pool , and allows rrhs to use sleep mode efficiently to decrease energy consumption .",
    "rrhs are preferred to provide both real - time and non - real time multimedia applications with high speed data rates , such as real - time interactive high quality video , delay - tolerant web browsing , non - real time video or massive file download , etc . with the help of mbss",
    ", rrhs can be used to provide only the high - capacity service and are transparent to the served users .",
    "note that the radio signal processing for all rrhs is executed in the bbu pool , while for the mbs is implemented locally .",
    "the inter - tier interference between the bbu pool and the mbs can be mitigated by the distributed coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission and reception technique . comparing with c - rans and hetnets , h - crans",
    "have been demonstrated to significant performance gains though advanced collaborative signal processing and cooperative radio resource allocation are still challenging .",
    "intuitively , cloud computing in the bbu pool based on large - scale cooperative signal processing can suppress intra - tier interference and achieve significant cooperative gains in h - crans .",
    "the inter - tier interference to rrhs from the mbs equipped with multiple antennas can be suppressed by coordinated scheduling or cooperative multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques , which substantially improves the spectral efficiency ( se ) .",
    "for instance , inter - tier interference can be suppressed by using zero - forcing , which results from the aggressive spatial multiplexing @xcite .",
    "such characteristics in h - crans bring challenges to optimize the overall se or energy efficiency ( ee ) because too many factors and challenges must be jointly considered , such as collaborative signal processing to suppress intra - tier and inter - tier interference in the physical ( phy ) layer , and cooperative radio resource allocation and queue - aware packet scheduling in the medium access control ( mac ) and upper layers .",
    "in addition , capacity constraints of fronthaul and backhaul links must be considered as well .",
    "much attention has been paid to resource allocation in c - rans recently . in , to minimize the network power consumption , a greedy rrh on@xmath0off selection algorithm has been proposed to maximize the reduction in the network power consumption at each step . in , an antenna selection scheme that jointly optimizes the antenna selection , regularization factor and power allocation has been presented to maximize the averaged weighted sum - rate in large - scale c - ran downlink systems .",
    "the joint optimization of mimo and discontinuous transmission ( dtx ) with practical implementation constraints has been investigated in to improve ee performance .",
    "meanwhile , has proposed a joint cell association and beamformer design algorithm for downlink and uplink c - rans .",
    "clearly , these characteristics and achievements to improve se and ee performance of c - rans should be further enhanced in h - crans , in which the cell association with rrh / mbs and the inter - tier interference should be additionally considered .    meanwhile , a number of studies have considered the se and ee optimization of hetnets , in which radio resource allocation with the consideration of inter - tier interference is often the primary focus . in , an ee optimization problem with statistical quality of service ( qos ) constraints in orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) systems has been analyzed , and a subchannel grouping scheme to obtain a closed form solution has been presented , which is simplified to a multi - target single - channel optimization problem by using the channel - matrix singular value decomposition method . in , to improve ee in heterogeneous cognitive femtocell networks , a spectrum sharing and",
    "resource allocation scheme has been formulated as a stackelberg game , and a gradient based iterative algorithm has been proposed to achieve the stackelberg equilibrium solution . in , an energy - efficient partial spectrum reuse ( psr ) scheme has been proposed .",
    "since the optimal psr factor , defined as the portion of spectrum reused by micro cells in two - tier heterogeneous networks , is not in an explicit form generally , a closed - form limit of the optimal psr factor has been derived as the ratio of the user rate requirement to the entire system spectrum bandwidth .",
    "numerical results showed that adopting psr can reduce the network energy consumption by up to 50% when the transmit power of mbss is 10db higher than that of low power nodes ( lpns ) .",
    "an energy efficient precoding for coordinated multi - point transmission under constraints of individual date rate requirements from each user , maximal transmit power of each base station ( bs ) , and zero - forcing ( zf ) has been obtained by introducing the subspace decomposition method in , where the performance gain of the proposed zf precoder has been verified by comparing with several existing optimal linear precoders .",
    "the aforementioned works typically assume that all users are time - delay insensitive and neglect special qos requirements for delay sensitive users , which may suffer serious performance deterioration caused by the large service delay . to minimize the user s queuing time and achieve a degree of fairness",
    ", the authors of  @xcite designed an efficient blind scheduling policy that performs well across magnitudes of fairness , simplicity , and asymptotic optimality for a relatively general mobile media cloud . in , a joint power and rate control algorithm with average delay constraints has been proposed and solved by a game - theoretic model . to study energy efficiency - delay tradeoffs in multiple - access networks ,",
    "a game - theoretic approach is proposed in , where each user seeks to choose a transmit power that maximizes its own utility while satisfying its delay requirements . to deal with the co - channel interference problem and the individual statistical delay qos guarantee problem ,",
    "the cross - layer optimization of a two - tier underlay hetnet has been studied in using large deviation theory , in which the cross - layer optimization problem is transformed into a long term weighted sum effective capacity maximization problem .",
    "in addition , to further guarantee the service fairness between different delay - tolerant users , the queue backlogs maintained at the transmitters for each user have to be considered in the design of radio resource optimization schemes .",
    "the authors of have investigated the delay - optimal policy in a two - user multiple access channel , where the delay minimization problem is formulated as a markov decision process ( mdp ) and the optimal policy traded a portion of the sum - rate for balancing the queue lengths to minimize the average delay .",
    "the delay - optimal power and subcarrier allocation problem for ofdma systems was modeled as a @xmath1-dimensional infinite horizon average reward mdp with the control actions based on channel state information ( csi ) and joint queue state information ( qsi ) in .",
    "furthermore , a cache - enabled cross - layer opportunistic cooperative mimo framework for wireless video streaming is proposed in . by equipping the relay with a cache to buffer the video streams ,",
    "the cache control policy adaptive to the popularity of the video files could provide more cooperative opportunities , while the power control policy adaptive to qsi and csi is determined by solving the approximated mdp approach using the continuous time bellman equations to maintain the qos metrics of playback interruption probability and the buffer overflow probability .    however , the number of queues in realistic systems is not often sufficiently large , which causes the issue of curse of dimensionality with the mdp approach due to the exponential growth of the cardinality of the system state space .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to obtain a distributed resource allocation solution with mdp since the potential function is not decomposable . to achieve a desired tradeoff between network throughput and queuing delay , and proposed distributed resource allocation and user scheduling solutions in long term evolution - advanced ( lte - a ) relay networks and wireless multihop networks , respectively , both of which utilize lyapunov optimization to stabilize the queues of networks when optimizing performance metrics .",
    "lyapunov optimization is a useful tool for handling queue - aware radio resource allocation problems with a good balance between performance and implementation complexity . for the lyapunov optimization theory ,",
    "the concepts of lyapunov function and lyapunov drift are introduced , and the performance metrics of the network can be optimized while stabilizing queues of the network by greedily minimizing the drift - plus - penalty . with the lyapunov optimization approach ,",
    "the problem of opportunistic cooperation in a cognitive two - tier underlay hetnet has been studied in , where the cognitive lpns handle intelligent access admission , cooperation decision making , and power control to maximize their own throughputs subject to average power constraints .",
    "the obtained online control algorithm can stabilize the multimedia traffic queue without requiring any knowledge of the multimedia traffic arrival rates .",
    "a two - stage queue - aware cross - layer radio resource allocation algorithm has been proposed in based on minimizing drift - plus - utility , which can be easily applied for hetnets .",
    "inspired by@xcite@xcite , the well - developed stability theory of lyapunov optimization is considered in this paper . since the optimal radio resource allocation policy can be achieved by minimizing the drift - plus - utility , in which the resulting queuing delay and utility performance are bounded , we focus on maximizing ee under the stable queue with the transmit power , individual fronthaul capacity , and interference constraints in h - crans .",
    "there are three technical challenges associated with this ee optimization problem in queue - aware h - crans :    * * challenges due to joint considerations of ee and queuing delay : * unlike other works focusing only on optimizing se or ee , which only requires csi in the phy layer , the optimization involving ee and average queuing delay is fundamentally challenging since it introduces coupling between the phy and mac layers .",
    "to take the queuing delay into consideration , the resource allocation policy should be a function of both qsi and csi , which is a nontrivial problem since the qsi and csi vary randomly at each time slot and may not have a closed - form expression . * * challenges due to inter - tier interference and individual fronthaul capacity constraints : * unlike traditional c - rans , the inter - tier interference from mbss in h - crans should be suppressed by advanced collaborative processing techniques , and the inter - tier interference to mues should be mitigated to a low level with advanced coordinated scheduling and power control techniques . unlike the traditional hetnets , intra - tier interference among rrhs in h - crans can be suppressed through the centralized bbu pool but with individual fronthaul capacity constraints , and the inter - tier interference often exists between a single powerful mbs and a very large number of rrhs . * * challenges due to minimization of drift - plus - penalty : * the queues of data flows are coupled due to the mutual inter - tier interference in h - crans .",
    "thus , the associated stochastic optimization problem formulated by minimizing the drift - plus - penalty under the lyapunov optimization framework is complex because resource allocation decisions for different rrhs are affected by each other . with",
    "the time - varying nature of wireless environments , this problem is challenging to solve .      with the introduction of h - crans , the development of effective radio resource management techniques to optimize ee for non - real time packet service",
    "is important .",
    "in addition , to satisfy diverse qos requirements , it is crucial to use cross - layer radio resource management algorithms in h - crans , which has been seldom studied to date . in this paper , a weighted ee performance metric is presented , and the corresponding ee optimization problem with inter - tier interference , individual fronthaul capacity , and total transmission power constraints",
    "is formulated , in which both cross - layer design and queue - aware congestion control are taken into account . since this ee optimization problem is a combination of time - averaged variables and instantaneous variables , an optimal network - wide cooperative beamformer design algorithm is proposed based on minimizing the drift - plus - utility under the lyapunov optimization framework , in which a generalized weighted minimum mean square error ( wmmse )  @xcite approach is used to optimize the ee performance and guarantee the queue stability . although the wmmse approach has been applied in  @xcite to jointly optimize the user scheduling and beamforming vectors under either dynamic or fixed bs clustering for c - rans , this previous work does not explicitly take the ee optimization and queue stability into consideration for h - crans .",
    "the major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "an average weighted ee utility function in terms of sum transmit rate and total energy consumption with different weight factors is defined to capture the ee performance in h - crans . to maximize this ee performance metric and keep the multimedia traffic queue stability , an ee optimization problem with the instantaneous and average power , individual fronthaul capacity and inter - tier interference constraints is formulated for queue - aware h - crans . to solve this non - convex optimization problem ,",
    "the lyapunov optimization framework is utilized , under which the optimization problem is transformed into the minimization of the drift - plus - penalty function .",
    "furthermore , this minimization of the drift - plus - penalty function can be reformulated as the optimal network - wide beamformer design problem under transmit power and inter - tier interference constraints . * a generalized wmmse approach",
    "is proposed to solve the optimal network - wide beamformer design problem .",
    "unlike previous work in  @xcite , whose aim is to solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem with backhaul constraints in c - rans , this paper applies the generalized wmmse approach to solve the average weighted ee utility objective function with each rrh s transmit power , individual fronthaul capacity , and inter - tier interference constraints . to quantitatively optimize the tradeoff between the average weighted ee and the queuing delay on demand ,",
    "a non - negative parameter @xmath2 is defined , which in turn adaptively affects the solutions of network - wide cooperative beamformer design and power allocation .",
    "* the proposed optimal network - wide beamformer design algorithm can approach an @xmath3 $ ] tradeoff between the averaged weighted ee performance and queue backlog , which indicates that the average weighted ee performance can be arbitrarily close to the optimum with the gap of @xmath4 at the expense of incurring an average queue backlog that is @xmath5 .",
    "simulation results exhibit the ee performance under varied @xmath2 , and show the influence of the fronthaul capacity constraint on the tradeoff between the average weighted ee performance and average queue backlog .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model and formulates the optimization problem . in section iii ,",
    "based on the general lyapunov optimization framework , the formulated problem is transformed into a wmmse problem which can be solved by an iterative approach . in section iv , the performance of the proposed network - wide beamformer design algorithm is analyzed .",

    "in this section , the considered h - cran system scenario and definition of network stability are introduced .",
    "based on the h - cran system model and defined queue stability , the ee optimization problem is formulated .      as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sys ] , a downlink h - cran system consisting of one mbs and @xmath19 rrhs is considered .",
    "@xmath19 rrhs are deployed within the same coverage of the single mbs in an underlay manner .",
    "the rrhs and mbs are connected to a bbu pool with the fronthaul and backhaul links , respectively .",
    "the mbs and each rrh are equipped with @xmath20 and @xmath21 antennas , respectively .",
    "define the set of mbs and rrhs as @xmath22 , where the index @xmath13 refers to the mbs , which serves @xmath23 single - antenna mbs user equipments ( mues ) , and @xmath24 denotes the set of rrhs , which cooperatively serve @xmath25 single - antenna rrh user equipments ( rues ) with user - centric clustering .",
    "define the set of rues as @xmath26 , and the set of mues as @xmath27 .",
    "this h - cran system is assumed to operate in the slotted time mode with the unit time slot @xmath28 , where the time slot @xmath29 refers to the interval @xmath30 . under the assumption that the bbu pool centrally processes all rues signals and distributes each rue s data to an individually selected cluster of rrhs through fronthaul links , each rue is cooperatively served by its serving cluster through the joint beamforming technique , and receives an independent data stream from the rrh at the time slot @xmath29 .",
    "it is assumed that the scalar - valued data stream @xmath31 is temporally white with zero mean and unit variance .",

    "given that @xmath36 , @xmath37 can be represented through @xmath38 , i.e. ,    @xmath39    note that @xmath40 can be written as a combination of the transmit power ( @xmath41 ) and the unit beamformer ( @xmath42 ) for simplicity .",
    "in particular , the transmit beamformer from the mbs to mue @xmath33 is denoted by @xmath43 . though all rrhs can potentially serve each scheduled rue , in fact , each rue is mainly contributed to by only a small number of adjacent rrhs and the network - wide beamforming vector is often group sparse  @xcite .",
    "with the linear transmit beamforming scheme at the rrhs  @xcite , the received signal at the rue @xmath33 , denoted by @xmath44 , consists of the desired signal , the interference signal of other rues , and the interference signal of the total @xmath23 mues . as a result , @xmath44 can be written as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 denotes the csi matrix from all rrhs transmit antennas to the rue @xmath33 , and @xmath47 denotes the csi matrix from the mbs s transmit antennas to the rue @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath48 is the received noise at the rue @xmath33 with the distribution @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the noise variance at rues .",
    "( [ eq : i1 ] ) suggests that both @xmath51 and @xmath52 should be carefully designed to suppress the intra - tier and inter - tier interference , respectively .      since the mbs in h - crans",
    "is mainly used to deliver the control signalling and provide seamless coverage with a low bit rate , for the ease of implementation , the beamformers of the mbs can be assumed to be fixed over a longer duration than the scheduling slot of rrhs , and thus the performance of mues can be assumed to remain stable if the inter - tier interference from rrhs is suppressed to a pre - defined threshold .",
    "therefore , we can focus only on the performance optimization with queue stability for overall rrhs in h - crans under the condition that the queue stability of the mbs is guaranteed .",
    "suppose there are queues maintained for rues in h - crans which are represented by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the queue backlog for rue @xmath33 at time slot @xmath29 .",
    "the random multimedia traffic arrival for rue @xmath33 at the time slot @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath55 , which is assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) over time slots with the peak arrival rate @xmath56 .",

    "therefore , @xmath61 evolves according to    @xmath62    considering the random and bursty characteristics of multimedia traffic arrivals and the qos requirement of rues in h - crans , it is imperative to consider queue - aware resource allocation techniques . therefore , to achieve this objective , the queue stability is defined as follows .",
    "_ a discrete time process @xmath63 is mean - rate stable  @xcite if _",
    "@xmath64    note that an absolute value of @xmath63 is used in the mean rate stability definition , which is useful for virtual queues those can be possibly negative .      to optimize the ee performance of h - crans ,",
    "transmission rate and power consumption performance metrics should be jointly considered . according to ( [ eq : i1 ] ) , these two performance metrics are both presented as functions of the network - wide beamforming vector @xmath65 for rue @xmath33 :    * _ transmission rate : _ rue @xmath33 is scheduled at time slot @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath66 is nonzero if and only if its network - wide beamforming vector @xmath65 is nonzero .",
    "based on the network - wide beamforming vector @xmath65 for rue @xmath33 and @xmath51 for rue @xmath67 , the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) can be directly derived as @xmath68 . as a result , according to the shannon capacity formula , the achievable transmission rate for rue @xmath33 at time slot @xmath29 can be expressed as + @xmath69 + where @xmath70 can be assumed to remain constant in time slot @xmath29 because the beamformers of the mbs are fixed . * _ power consumption : _ since the transmitted signals from rrhs to rues have unit variance , the radio frequency power consumption @xmath71 of the @xmath32-th rrh in the time slot @xmath29 depends only on the beamformer transmitting to the rues . therefore , the power consumption for rrh @xmath32 serving all potential @xmath25 rues can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the total power consumption of the @xmath32-th rrh , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the circuit power consumption and fronthaul power consumption of rrh @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "note that the circuit power of rrhs is negligible because the energy consumption of air conditioning is avoided . since rrhs are connected to the bbu pool via optical fiber to alleviate fronthaul capacity constraints , the power consumption of the fronthaul is rather small compared with the transmit power of rrhs , and it can be neglected , too .",

    "thus , a network - wide cooperative beamformer design algorithm is proposed in the next subsection to solve problem ( [ eq : ii16 ] ) .",
    "the optimization problem ( [ eq : ii16 ] ) is non - convex , which is difficult to solve directly . to present a solution of ( [ eq : ii16 ] ) , the performance of control actions to obtain a local minimum which is within an additive constant of the infimum is analyzed .",
    "therefore , in the following content , the definition of _ c - additive approximation _ is first introduced , based on which the locally optimal solution of problem ( [ eq : ii16 ] ) is analyzed .",
    "finally , a network - wide beamformer design algorithm is proposed .",
    "for a given constant @xmath137 , a _ c - additive approximation _ of the drift - plus - penalty algorithm is to choose an action that yields a conditional expected value on the right - hand - side of the drift - plus - penalty ( given @xmath138 ) at time slot @xmath29 , that is within a constant @xmath139 from the infimum over all possible control actions .",
    "based on _ definition 3 _ , a local optimal beamformer algorithm can be designed .",
    "note that in the constraint @xmath109 , the indicator function can be equivalently expressed as a scalar @xmath140-norm , which is the number of nonzero entries in a vector .",
    "the indicator function can be approximated by a convex re - weighted @xmath141-norm , i.e. ,    @xmath142    where @xmath143 is updated iteratively according to @xmath144 with a small constant regularization factor @xmath145 and @xmath146 from the previous iteration . since it is still difficult to solve a problem that involves @xmath66 in both the objective function and the constraints , an iterative scheme is used in which the fixed value of @xmath66 from the previous iteration is adopted here .",
    "thus , the optimization problem can be written as @xmath147 where @xmath148 in @xmath149 is the rate of the previous iteration . obviously , the approximated problem ( [ eq : ii17 ] ) is still non - convex , while it can be reformulated as an equivalent wmmse problem to achieve a local optimum via the _ c - additive approximation _ of the drift - plus - penalty algorithm .",

    "the random initial point can approach a local optimum through * algorithm 1 * with a substantial number of iterations . to decrease the number of iterations and approach a local optimal solution quickly , it is critical to choose proper initialization points with reasonable approaches such as the interference alignment initialization proposed in @xcite .",
    "remark 2 : * algorithm 1 * is based on the block coordinate descent method . in this case , the computational complexity of step 2 in * algorithm 1 * is @xmath166 , mainly due to the receive covariance matrix computation in ( [ eq : ii19 ] ) and ( [ eq : ii22 ] ) . with the mse @xmath152 obtained from step 2 ,",
    "the additional computational complexity for step 3 to update all mse weights @xmath151 is only @xmath167 .",
    "step 4 requires solution of the qcqp problem , which is the largest part of the computational complexity in * algorithm 1*. the total number of variables in the qcqp problem is @xmath168 and the computation complexity of using the cvx method to solve such an qcqp problem is approximately @xmath169 .",
    "step 5 has the same computational complexity as computing the mse , and the computational complexity of the remaining steps is @xmath167 .",
    "it is noted that the complexity of solving such a qcqp problem is related to the number of potential transmit antennas @xmath170 serving each user and the total number of users @xmath25 to be considered in each iteration .",
    "thus , to improve the efficiency of * algorithm 1 * in each iteration , it is practical to reduce the number of potential transmit antennas @xmath170 and the total number of users @xmath25 .",

    "<S> the heterogeneous cloud radio access network ( h - cran ) is a promising paradigm which incorporates the cloud computing into heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) , thereby taking full advantage of cloud radio access networks ( c - rans ) and hetnets . </S>",
    "<S> characterizing the cooperative beamforming with fronthaul capacity and queue stability constraints is critical for multimedia applications to improving energy efficiency ( ee ) in h - crans . </S>",
    "<S> an energy - efficient optimization objective function with individual fronthaul capacity and inter - tier interference constraints is presented in this paper for queue - aware multimedia h - crans . to solve this non - convex objective function , a stochastic optimization problem is reformulated by introducing the general lyapunov optimization framework . under the lyapunov framework , this optimization problem is equivalent to an optimal network - wide cooperative beamformer design algorithm with instantaneous power , average power and inter - tier interference constraints , which can be regarded as the weighted sum ee maximization problem and solved by a generalized weighted minimum mean square error approach . </S>",
    "<S> the mathematical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that a tradeoff between ee and queuing delay can be achieved , and this tradeoff strictly depends on the fronthaul constraint .    </S>",
