    "loop quantum cosmology @xcite is a family of symmetry reduced models built via methods of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it serves both as a testing ground for the quantization frameworks used in quantum gravity @xcite and also a shortcut way to derive some physical predictions .",
    "one of the most surprising predictions it provides is the modification of the dynamics at near - planck energy densities leading to the replacement of the classical big bang by a quantum big bounce .",
    "although the most solid and robust results were obtained for isotropic cosmological models @xcite , there is an ongoing research ( with various stages of rigour ) treating homogeneous but anisotropic @xcite or even inhomogeneous models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with some conceptual aspects of quantum gravity and study them on the example of the homogeneous isotropic lqc model .",
    "they are : existence of a quantum spacetime metric tensor operator , definition of a solution to the quantum einstein constraints , mechanism of singularity avoidance and the role of the kinematical quantum geometry for the properties of the physical quantum geometry .    before going to the technical details of the lqc model used in this work",
    ", we will present an outline of our studies ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : pre - qsp ] through [ sec : out - zero ] ) .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lqc ] we will introduce the necessary technical details of the lqc model tested in this work , which is the model of isotropic , homogeneous spacetime interacting with a homogeneous scalar field introduced by ashtekar , pawlowski and singh @xcite . most of our results apply also ( either directly or can be generalized ) to the so called solvable lqc ( slqc ) model @xcite .",
    "one of the expectations upon the theory of quantum geometry is that it should provide a spacetime metric as a quantum operator @xmath10    in the canonical formulation of the einstein gravity , a general classical spacetime metric is written in the form @xmath11 in the gauge choice free approach , the lapse and shift functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , are just non - dynamical gauge parameters .",
    "therefore they should pass unchanged to the quantum theory , allowing in turn to write the metric tensor in the form    @xmath14    where the un - hatted functions are independent of @xmath15 . as a consequence , even in the quantum theory , the @xmath16 metric component commutes with all the other quantum metric components at any given instant @xmath17 .",
    "however , since einstein s gravity is a theory with constraints , the physical hilbert space differs from the kinematical one , and only the dirac observables can give rise to physical quantum observables .",
    "therefore , the spacetime metric should be first reexpressed in terms of them .",
    "a quite well understood class of the dirac observables are the _ partial observables _ developed recently by rovelli , dittrich and thiemann @xcite . a partial observable",
    "is constructed out of a kinematical observable and a family of _ clock functions _  functions defined on the classical phase space providing parametrizations of dynamical trajectories .",
    "one of possible choices of such clock function @xmath18 is a ( coupled to the gravitational field ) klein - gordon massless scalar field ( which is exactly the choice made in the aps model of the quantum frw spacetime @xcite ) . upon that choice",
    "one can write the metric tensor ( [ ds2gen ] ) as , @xmath19 the function @xmath20 is of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath18 , and the second equality follows from the canonical equations @xmath23    from it follows immediately that , since all terms on its righthand side are dynamical quantities , so is the function @xmath24 .",
    "thus in quantum theory one should consider a dirac observable corresponding to it .",
    "whereas on the kinematical hilbert space the operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 commute , the corresponding partial observables do not , therefore the quantum counterpart of the righthand side of is not uniquely defined .",
    "this problem can be seen at the classical level already .",
    "namely , if we denote by @xmath27 and @xmath28 the corresponding dirac observables ( we suppress the clock functions and other parameters needed to determine the observable ) , then their poisson bracket _ does not vanish_. indeed , ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the dirac bracket . furthermore , one can show by inspection ( using eq .",
    "( 2.18 ) of @xcite ) , that @xmath32 in consequence :    a.   a quantum counterpart of @xmath20 is an operator which does not commute with @xmath26 even at the same instant of time , b.   there is no unique definition of @xmath33 because of the ordering problem .    in this paper",
    ", we point out the issue and propose a definition of the quantum space - time metric tensor in the aps quantum frw model , where the expression for the lapse function reduces ( due to homogeneity ) to @xmath34      the quantum geometry operators are defined in the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "they are build , briefly speaking , out of the 3-metric tensor .",
    "the question regards the role and the properties of the quantum geometry operators in the physical hilbert space .",
    "considered operators can be defined by using the relational observables of rovelli - dittrich - thiemann . on the one hand",
    ", they form in this case the same poisson algebra as the kinematical ones . also in simple examples ( @xmath35 ) their quantum algebra is equivalent to the algebra of the kinematical quantum geometry operators . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath4 there are many differences between the kinematical and physical quantum geometry .",
    "we discuss them is sec .",
    "[ sec : phys - oper ] .      in a canonical approach to quantum gravity",
    "one has to define subsequently    * a quantum scalar constraint operator * the constraint condition , that is the mechanism via which the constraint operator selects the physical hilbert space * a physical hilbert space of solutions , which involves in particular specification of the scalar product on it .    in our case",
    "the quantum constraint operator has the form @xmath36 where @xmath12 is the lapse .",
    "one choice is to take lapse to be a number .    on the other hand ,",
    "taking into account ( [ n ] ) and the quantum nature of the lapse one is lead to the constraint operator @xmath37^{-1}{{\\widehat{c_{{{\\rm gr}}}}}}\\ , \\ ] ] suitably symmetrised in the second term and @xmath38 .",
    "this distinction takes place if one wants to derive the aps model by the group averaging method .",
    "however our results apply also to the slqc in which there is no distinction of this type . ]    given either one of the constraints , one can turn to the second step and define the corresponding constraint condition .",
    "it reads : take the spectral decomposition defined by the operator and allow only elements of the hilbert space corresponding to the zero eigenvalue .    at this point",
    "we make a suprising discovery :    * on the one hand , the first operator ( [ eq : corig ] ) has a unique self - adjoint extension for arbitrary cosmological constant ; we point it out in section [ sec : c - noneq ] and give a mathematical argument . * on the other hand , the second operator ( [ eq : ctheta ] ) has inequivalent self - adjoint extensions if @xmath4 .    in other words ,",
    "the second constraint operator does not define a constraint condition uniquely , because the spectral decomposition depends of a self - adjoint extension .",
    "hence , solutions to that quantum scalar constraint depend on some additional choice which has to be made .",
    "this apparent discrepancy forces us to ask a question : what is a relation between the uniquely defined hilbert space of solutions of the constraint ( [ eq : corig ] ) and the extension dependent hilbert spaces of solutions to the second constraint ( [ eq : ctheta ] ) ?    to address it",
    "we explain in detail the difference in the properties of the operators and , respectively , in sec . [",
    "sec : c - noneq ] . also , we briefly discuss the relation between hilbert spaces of the solutions to those different constraints ( the detailed analysis will be presented in @xcite ) .      within cosmological model specified at the end of section [ sec : pre - qsp ] the equality satisfied by the lapse function ( now given by )",
    "can be also written in the following way @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the _ energy density of the scalar field with _ respect to the class of observers comoving with the universe .    the quantum energy density operator and its spectrum is another subject discussed in this paper on its own . the operator is used in the aps model as the measure of the avoidance of the singularity . at the early stages of lqc it was believed that the singularity avoidance is a kinematical effect implied by the non - singular way the metric determinant inverse shows up in the expression of the energy density . indeed , the lqg motivated quantization of that expression has ( up to factor ordering ambiguity ) the form @xmath41 where the operator @xmath42 is bounded , and actually annihilates the vector annihilated by @xmath43 .",
    "a stronger result takes place in the aps model .",
    "namely , the expectation value of the energy density @xmath44 evolving with the time @xmath18",
    "approaches certain universal value ( of the order of planck energy density @xmath45 ) derived in @xcite .",
    "however recently it was shown @xcite that due to subtleties in constructing the loop of minimal area in lqc the so called area gap ( lowest nonzero area eigenvalue ) is twice bigger than the one used in @xcite . in consequence",
    "the value of @xmath46 ( depending on it ) is twice smaller and equals approximately @xmath47 . ] @xmath48 from below , and bounces back .",
    "here we show , that the essential spectrum of @xmath49 is @xmath50 \\ .\\ ] ] there may still exist discrete spectrum elements bigger then @xmath46 , however , the corresponding eigenfunctions are focused near the zero volume and therefore their contribution to semiclassical states focused at large scalar field momentum ( and so at large volumes ) is extremely small .      a technical subtlety concerning the constraint operators above ,",
    "is that in the aps model the zero volume state @xmath51 is at the same time annihilated by the inverse - volume operator @xmath52 this leads to an impression of incompleteness in a definition of the operator @xmath53 in @xmath54 present even after the modification of the scalar product which removes that zero volume state .",
    "the solution to that subtlety is hidden in the results published in the literature @xcite , but it has never been spelled out .",
    "we will present the details in sec .",
    "[ sec : zero ] showing in particular some constraint being induced in @xmath55 by the scalar constraint operator .",
    "the presence of this constraint allowed to define rigorously the evolution operator in @xcite and following works .",
    "the discussed structure allows in particular to immediately extend the results of @xcite to superselection sector containing the @xmath56 state .",
    "in lqc , like in the other cosmological models , one restricts the einstein s theory to the space of the space - time metrics and other fields having a given symmetry .",
    "here we consider the case of friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) models corresponding to homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes . in this section",
    "we briefly introduce the quantum description of these models within lqc framework . for shortness",
    "we will introduce only those elements of the lqc models which will be relevant for our studies . for more detailed description of the quantization procedure",

    "these properties boil down to conditions    [ eq : afhom]@xmath61    the diffeomorphism constraints are trivially satisfied , hence the only einstein constraint is the scalar constraint .",

    "one also introduces the oriented volume function ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , namely @xmath69 with the sign depending on the orientation in @xmath70 of the triad with respect to a fixed fiducial orientation of @xmath60 . the kinematical hilbert space and the quantum operators of the scalar field @xmath18 and its conjugate momentum @xmath71 are    @xmath72    the kinematical hilbert space and the basic quantum operators for the gravitational field in the aps and slqc model are ,    @xmath73    where the operator @xmath74 is a shift operator  a component of an operator corresponding to the classical holonomy function involving @xmath75 .",

    "a physical observable @xmath25 is @xmath109 the volume operator @xmath110 defined in the kinematical hilbert space gives rise to the physical observable @xmath111 ( modulo the discussion in sec .",

    "the first one commutes with the constraint , whereas the second defines the dirac observables via the relational observables construction .",
    "therefore , aps assume that the sufficient set of quantum operators to describe every quantum state consists of the following operators :    [ eq : obses]@xmath115    furthermore , there are subspaces @xmath116 preserved by the action of all the quantum observables , labeled by arbitrary @xmath117 and a sign ` @xmath118 ' or ` @xmath119 ' corresponding to the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) .",

    "* we will often ignore the reducibility and consider the whole hilbert space @xmath138 .",
    "in the dirac program one of the most common techniques of constructing observables on @xmath108 is an appropriate pull - back onto it of kinematical ones . however",
    "unless the quantity measured by given observable is a constant of motion such direct pull - back will not correspond to any physically interesting property of the system .",
    "therefore in such cases one tries to construct operators measuring kinematical quantity `` at a given time ''",
    "( example of which is the operator @xmath139 defined in @xcite ) .",
    "technically this corresponds to the pull - back of kinematical observable to an auxiliary hilbert space , the image of mapping . in this section",
    "we address ( in context of lqc ) the question of how the original properties of kinematical operators transfer to physical spaces .",
    "we will see that even the volume operator , seemingly under a perfect control , may surprisingly change much more , than it is expected in the lqc literature .",
    "let us start our analysis in the context of an aps lqc , where @xmath134 .",
    "there the auxiliary hilbert space is a space @xmath140 equipped with the modified scalar product @xmath141 .",
    "the quantum volume operator is unchanged by this modification , and is still well defined and essentially self - adjoint in the domain @xmath142 .",
    "however a general operator @xmath143 defined in that domain in @xmath144 should be redefined such that modulo the ordering it corresponds to the same classical kinematical observable , but has the correct properties with respect to the @xmath145 operation .",
    "an example of such redefinition is replacing @xmath143 defined in @xmath144 by @xmath146 defined in @xmath124 .",
    "in fact , this transformation coincides with the pull back of @xmath143 by the unitary map used in the previous section , which is    [ eq : tr2]@xmath147    and the inverse image of the domain @xmath142 is @xmath148 . as we mentioned , the volume operator @xmath110 is not affected by that transformation ( modulo the small restriction of the domain consisting in disappearing of the zero volume eigenvector @xmath149 . )    in the slqc case , on the other hand , the auxiliary space is directly @xmath55 , so the analog of the transformation is just an identity .",
    "the transformation presented above does not however solve all the problems . to see that let us go back to the construction of the physical hilbert space . to shorten the explanation",
    "we introduce the common notation denoting by @xmath150 the hilbert space @xmath151 in the aps model case , or @xmath152 in the slqc case",
    ". then each element of @xmath108 is represented by a mapping @xmath153 where the @xmath154 valued functions @xmath103 satisfy the equation @xmath155 choosing any instant of @xmath156 , we have two maps from the space of the solutions to @xmath157 , @xmath158 corresponding , respectively , to the positive and negative frequency solutions .",
    "let us fix one of them ( that is either ` @xmath118 ' or ` @xmath119 ' ) .",
    "now , the important observation is , that if the operator @xmath105 is not positive ( which happens for example in the case @xmath4 ) , then the image of the map ( [ themap ] ) is not the entire hilbert space @xmath154 .",
    "indeed , a physical solution should satisfy at every instant @xmath112 , @xmath159 assuming that the operator @xmath105 is self - adjoint , we can identify the image of the map with the subspace @xmath160 of @xmath157 corresponding to the non - negative part of the spectrum of @xmath105 .",
    "let us now consider an example of the operator @xmath143 , the volume @xmath161 .",
    "for the pullback of the operator at any @xmath18 to @xmath162 to be well defined , the answer to the following two questions should be affirmative :    a.   [ it : q1 ] is any dense subset of @xmath163 contained in the ( maximally extended ) domain of the operator @xmath110 ? b.   [ it : q2 ] is the space @xmath163 preserved by the volume operator @xmath110 ?    when @xmath164 , the answer to the question is likely to be negative .",
    "in particular , we do know that the eigenvectors of the evolutions operator @xmath105 are not in the domain of the volume operator .",
    "a heuristic reason for that can be seen at the classical level already , when the trajectories reach infinite volume for finite @xmath18 . to avoid this problem",
    "one has to  compactify  the volume , that is to consider , instead of @xmath110 , an operator @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is a bounded ( but monotonic ) function .",
    "the most likely answer to the question is also `` no '' .",
    "this means that , given a solution @xmath103 of ( [ thec ] ) at an instant @xmath112 ( taking values in the subspace @xmath167 ) , in general there is no solution @xmath106 of ( [ thec ] ) such that @xmath168 to overcome this problem one can employ the fact , that the sesquilinear form @xmath169 defined by @xmath165 can be restricted to any subspace and define an operator therein .",
    "this is equivalent to using the orthogonal projection @xmath170 and replacing he operator @xmath165 by @xmath171 the final operator @xmath172 is a well defined observable , in a sense that the answer to both and is affirmative .    to summarize , in the case when @xmath173 is not positive definite the straightforward pull - back of the kinematical volume operator does not define correct physical observable . to define it",
    "correctly one has to implement additional modifications , like the ones presented above .",
    "however , one should be aware of the likelyhood of change of the commutation relations between projected operators , as in general for a projection operator @xmath174 we have @xmath175\\ \\not=\\ p[a , b]p \\ .\\ ] ]    finally , let us consider a relation of the physical volume operator with the original , kinematical one in the aps model .",
    "when the operator @xmath105 is positive , the map @xmath176 is unitary .",
    "it pulls back the operator @xmath110 to the observable operator @xmath177 .",
    "hence , the spectrum of the resulting physical operator observable @xmath177 coincides with the spectrum of the restriction of @xmath110 and it is independent of @xmath112 .",
    "the situation changes if the operator @xmath105 is non - definite .",
    "the physical operator is now the pullback by ( [ iso ] ) of the modified operator @xmath178 which is just a different operator than @xmath165 . in consequence",

    "the unitary non - equivalence of the different extensions follows from the difference between the corresponding discrete spectra .    that non - uniqueness in the self - adjoint extensions is related to the properties of the classical system : the evolution of the frw spacetime reaches the end ( the infinite physical time of the observers expanding with the universe also corresponding to an infinite volume ) in a finite value of the scalar field @xmath18 used as a time variable . in consequence to continue evolution in @xmath18 one has to specify boundary conditions at @xmath210 .    surprisingly , those properties of the constraint operator ( [ c1 ] ) in the case @xmath4 , are in contrast with the properties of the constraint operator ( [ bc ] ) corresponding to the choice of the lapse function @xmath211 , namely :    [ thm : o1 ] the operator @xmath88 is essentially self adjoint for arbitrary value of the cosmological constant @xmath2 and for arbitrary case @xmath92 .    the technical reason for this is the following general fact @xcite :    [ thm : l1 ] in the hilbert space @xmath212 consider an operator @xmath213 defined in the domain @xmath214 .",
    "that operator is essentially self - adjoint for every function @xmath215 and every nowhere - vanishing function @xmath216 such that @xmath217    note , that the result holds for @xmath218 due to the asymptotic behavior @xmath219 for @xmath220 . on the other hand it does not hold for constraint ( [ c1 ] ) for considering it amounts to replacing the function @xmath90 by a function @xmath221 ) term in @xmath222 is bounded ( in the aps case ) and does not spoil the essential - self adjointness while added to @xmath88 . as the consequence , self - adjoint extensions of the constraint operator is uniquely defined .    in summary ,",
    "we have considered two operators ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) of the quantum scalar constraint corresponding to the classical constraint @xmath223 with two different choices of a lapse function , namely : @xmath224 ( [ n1 ] ) and @xmath225 ( [ n2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "provided , the cosmological constant @xmath3 , each of the operators @xmath191 and @xmath190 has a uniquely defined self - adjoint extension .",
    "however , if the value of the cosmological constant is positive @xmath226 , then the quantum scalar constraint operator @xmath191 depends on a choice of a self adjoint extension of the operator @xmath105 .",
    "each choice determines a ( potentially ) distinct physical model .",
    "the operator @xmath190 on the other hand , is essentially self - adjoint for every value of @xmath2 .",
    "how do those results fit together ?",
    "what is the comparison between the sets of solutions to the quantum scalar constraint defined by using the operator @xmath191 as opposed to those defined by using the operator @xmath190 ?",
    "it turns out , that in every case with @xmath3 , the solutions to the quantum scalar constraint @xmath191 coincide with the solutions to the quantum scalar constraint @xmath190 and the physical model is independent of which constraint operator we use to construct it .",
    "let us turn now to the positive @xmath4 case .",
    "one can ask : what are the physical solutions obtained from the spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath190 . to answer it ,",
    "let us restrict ( for simplicity ) the space @xmath55 to the subspace @xmath227 that subspace is preserved by the operator @xmath228 , and actually , is exactly the subspace promoted to the physical hilbert space in @xcite , which makes our restriction justified .",
    "a physical solution @xmath103 obtained by the spectral decomposition of @xmath190 restricted to @xmath229 is a family @xmath230 of solutions to the constraints @xmath231 where the @xmath232 labels the self - adjoint extensions of the constraint operator , and @xmath233 stands for the corresponding extension .",
    "the physical scalar product derived from the spectral decomposition of @xmath190 is @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the physical scalar product between the states in the aps model .    in conclusion ,",
    "the physical hilbert space constructed directly from the constraint `` contains '' _ all _ the solutions given by _ all the self adjoint extensions _ of the operator @xmath173 .",
    "the reason for the quotation mark is that the solutions to are not normalizable solutions of .",
    "the detailed construction of the hilbert space of solutions to the constraint @xmath190 will be presented in @xcite .",
    "consider now the quantum scalar field energy density operator @xmath49 introduced in .",
    "for the flat isotropic frw systems considered so far in lqc @xcite the analysis of states semiclassical at late times has shown that the expectation values of @xmath49 for such states are always bounded from above by a fundamental value @xmath236 .",
    "this result was next extended in context of slqc ( for @xmath237 , @xmath35 ) to full physical hilbert space @xcite . in this section",
    "we address the issue of the boundedness of energy density both in solvable and aps formulation ( see sect . [",
    "sec : lqc ] ) of lqc from a slightly different perspective , namely by analysing the spectrum of the operator @xmath49 .    here , for the convenience",
    ", we will work with a slightly different representation of the physical states defined by the unitary embedding    [ eq : transf]@xmath238    the transformation does not affect the representation used in the slqc case in appendix [ sec : zero ] because that representation is defined directly in @xmath55 . in consequence @xmath173 is still well defined .",
    "an energy density operator should be given by a suitable symmetrization ` @xmath239 ' of the following operator product @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the critical energy density defined in @xcite .",
    "we will start our discussion with the simplest possible case and increase the level of complexity . to begin with",
    "let us consider the @xmath242 case ( see ( [ cgr ] ) ) , and @xmath132 .",
    "also , as the functions @xmath90 , @xmath83 we take the simplest ones  corresponding to slqc    [ eq : ab - slqc]@xmath243    defining the ordering `` all the functions in between the holonomy operators '' , we get the following operator @xmath244 the spectrum of this operator is @xmath245 $ ] . notice , that @xmath46 is exactly the maximal value achieved by @xmath44 during the big - bounce .",
    "now , consider the case    [ eq : ab - aps]@xmath246    here we can set the same ordering as in , @xmath247 although there is a multitude of other possibilities available , like for example @xmath248 in either case the resulting operator is plus a compact operator .",
    "therefore the essential spectrum is still @xmath245 $ ] , however there maybe a non - empty point spectrum above @xmath46 ( with possible accumulation point @xmath46 ) .",
    "the presence and structure of the point spectrum depends on particular ordering chosen .",
    "however , if the operator @xmath49 is not explicitly bounded from above by @xmath46 , this opens the possibility that the energy density expectation value can a - priori exceed @xmath46 for some physically interesting states .",
    "we address this issue now .    by a calculation similar to that in @xcite",
    ", one can show that the asymptotic behaviour of the solution to equation @xmath249 in dual space is the following ( @xmath250 are some coefficients depending only on @xmath251 ) @xmath252 where @xmath253 is a _ bounded _ rest term decaying like @xmath254 for large @xmath85 , and @xmath255 satisfies    @xmath256    this asymptotic behavior is valid for @xmath257 and gives exponential decay of eigenfunctions with eigenvalues @xmath258 .",
    "it is also worth noting , that ( at least for orderings given by ( [ eq : rho - ideal ] , [ eq : rho - used ] ) ) there are no normalizable solutions to with @xmath198 , therefore @xmath49 is invertible .    at this moment",
    "we can not exclude possibilities of existing eigenfunctions of @xmath49 with @xmath258 .",
    "indeed , the numerical check performed for @xmath49 given by ( via methods used for analysis of the spectrum of @xmath173 operator in @xcite ) revealed the existence of such eigenfunctions .",
    "an example of one of them is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : norm - eig ] .",
    "nevertheless we showed that any eigenfunction of @xmath258 decays exponentially in @xmath78 , with the exponent growing logarithmically with @xmath259 ( see ) . on the other hand",
    "the numerical simulations show that for large energies eigenfunctions of @xmath173 are supported away from small values of @xmath78 . in consequence",
    "their scalar product with eigenvalues of @xmath49 under consideration is very small .",
    "this fact explains why the influence of the latter can not be observed .     of the @xmath49 operator defined via corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath258 .",
    "an example presented here has eigenvalue very close to @xmath46 , namely @xmath260.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    an important difficulty emerges in the case of @xmath4 .",
    "then , the scalar field energy density operator is not any longer non - negative in @xmath261 , because it is of the form @xmath262 and the essential part of its spectrum is shifted with respect to @xmath35 case by @xmath263 .",
    "however , the solutions of the quantum constraint ( [ eq : c - gen ] ) take values in the subspace of @xmath261 corresponding to the non - negative part of the spectrum of @xmath173 .",
    "the question ( we do not know the answer to ) is whether or not @xmath49 restricted to that physical subspace becomes non - negative .",
    "since the answer probably depends on the choice of the density operator , the non - negativity is a condition of the ordering in a definition of @xmath49 consistent with the definition of @xmath173 .",
    "the problem which we leave open is whether or not the quantum spacetime metric tensor operator should be uniquely defined in qg .",
    "the proposal of such construction was made in section [ sec : qmetric ] however it suffers the factor ordering ambiguity . at this point there are two aspects of that issue which are worth commenting .",
    "first , the ordering ambiguity is restricted by the group averaging techniques . since the starting point for that procedure",
    "is the kinematical hilbert space , the operator @xmath25 commutes with the geometry operators .",
    "then the ambiguity is restricted just to a symmetrization of the product @xmath264 .",
    "we provide an extended explanation of that point in @xcite .",
    "second , it is possible to derive the propagation equation for a quantum test field on the quantum geometry background @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the result involves the quantum metric tensor components . remarkably , the expression is uniquely defined , whether the quantum metric tensor operator itself exists or not .",
    "thus , the possible physical solution of that issue may be that the quantum metric is defined uniquely only through matter propagating on it .",
    "another unsolved issue is how to understand the space of solutions to the quantum scalar constraint corresponding to the lapse function @xmath265 .",
    "the properties of each of the individual quantum constraint operators @xmath266 and , respectively , @xmath267 are familiar from the schroedinger quantum mechanics . in the first case",
    "the classical trajectories are not complete in the evolution parameter , namely infinite volume is achieved in finite time . that is usually an indication that a self - adjoint extension is likely to be not unique . in the second case ,",
    "the infinite volume is achieved only in infinite time .",
    "( the classical trajectories are incomplete at the zero volume as well , but in lqc this does not cause any evolution unbiguity . )",
    "therefore there is the analogy with the quantum mechanics .",
    "the difference , and a new ambiguity is , that in gravity we can have two characteristics in a single theory depending on choice of the evolution parameter .",
    "the details of the construction of the solutions to the constraint operator @xmath267 from the solutions of the variuos extensions of the constraint operator @xmath266 will be presented in @xcite .",
    "calculation of the partial observables might bring even more surprises .",
    "finally , in this work we have considered a simplest lqc model .",
    "however the full quantum gravity can be given a similar structure if it is formulated according to the brown - kuchar model @xcite .",
    "therefore many results discussed in this paper is likely to admit generalizations to the full qg .",
    "we would like to thank abhay ashtekar and guillermo mena - marugn for extensive discussions and helpful comments .",
