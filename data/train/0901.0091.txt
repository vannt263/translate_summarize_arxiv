    "standard financial market models assume that asset prices follow an exogenous stochastic process and that all transactions can be settled at the prevailing price without any impact on market dynamics .",
    "the assumption that all trades can be carried out at exogenously given prices is appropriate for small investors that trade only a negligible proportion of the overall daily trading volume ; it is not appropriate for institutional investors trading large blocks of shares over a short time span .",
    "the trading decisions of institutional investors are likely to move stock prices in an unfavorable direction and often induce significant trading costs .",
    "it is now widely recognized that ( the lack of ) liquidity is a major source of financial risk and there has been an increasing interest in mathematical models of illiquid financial markets .",
    "much of the literature on illiquidity focusses on either optimal hedging and portfolio liquidation strategies for a single large investor under market impact ( cetin , jarrow & protter ( 2004 ) , alfonsi , fruth & schied ( 2007 ) , rogers & singh ( 2007 ) ) , predatory trading ( carlin , lobo & viswanathan ( 2007 ) , schoeneborn & schied ( 2008 ) ) and the role of derivative securities including the problem of market manipulation using options ( jarrow ( 1992 ) , kumar & seppi ( 1992 ) ) . in an illiquid market",
    ", derivative traders have an incentive to utilize their impact on the price dynamics of the underlying in order move the option value in a favorable direction .",
    "it has been shown by jarrow ( 1994 ) , for instance , that by introducing derivatives into an otherwise complete and arbitrage - free market , manipulation strategies with a risk free gain may appear , such as market corners and front runs .",
    "schoenbucher & wilmott ( 2000 ) discuss an illiquid market model where a large trader can influence the stock price with vanishing costs and risk .",
    "they argue that the risk of manipulation on the part of the large trader makes the small traders unwilling to trade derivatives any more .",
    "in particular , they predict that the option market breaks down .",
    "our analysis indicates that markets do not necessarily break down when stock price manipulation is costly as it is in our model .",
    "while the aforementioned papers differ significantly in their degree of complexity , they all focus on a _ single player _ framework . when multiple players are considered the analysis is typically confined to some form of  stealth trading  as in carlin , lobo & viswanathan ( 2007 ) and schoeneborn & schied ( 2008 ) , where liquidity providers try to benefit from the liquidity demand that comes from some  large  investor but no strategic interaction between liquidity suppliers and consumers is considered .",
    "in fact , so far only little work has been devoted to models with strategically interacting market participants .",
    "vanden ( 2005 ) considers a pricing game in continuous time where the option issuer controls the volatility of the underlying but does not incur liquidity or spread crossing costs .",
    "he derives a nash equilibrium in the two player , risk neutral case and shows that  seemingly harmless derivatives , such as ordinary bull spreads , offer incentives for manipulation that are identical to those offered by digital options ",
    "( p. 1892 , l. 36 ) .",
    "gallmeyer & seppi ( 2000 ) consider a binomial model with three periods and finitely many risk neutral agents holding call options on an illiquid underlying . assuming a linear permanent price impact and linear transaction costs , and assuming that all agents are initially endowed with the same derivative they prove the existence of nash equilibrium trading strategy and indicate how market manipulation can be reduced .",
    "we provide a general mathematical framework within which to value derivative securities in illiquid markets under strategic interactions thereby extending the work of gallmeyer & seppi ( 2000 ) in several directions .",
    "specifically , we consider a pricing game between a finite number of large investors ( `` players '' ) holding european claims written on an illiquid stock .",
    "their goal is to maximize expected utility at maturity from trading the stock where their portfolio value at maturity depends on the trading strategies of all the other players , due to their impact on the dynamics of the underlying . following almgren & chriss ( 2001 )",
    "we assume that the players have a permanent impact on stock prices and that all trades are settled at the prevailing market price plus a liquidity premium .",
    "the liquidity premium can be viewed as an instantaneous price impact that affects transaction prices but not the value of the players inventory .",
    "this form of market impact modeling is analytically more tractable than that of obizhaeva & wang ( 2006 ) which also allows for temporary price impacts and resilience effects .",
    "it has also been adopted by , e.g. , carlin , lobo & viswanathan ( 2007 ) , schoeneborn & schied ( 2008 ) and many practitioners from the financial industry .",
    "our framework is flexible enough to allow for rather general liquidity costs including the linear cost function of almgren & chriss ( 2001 ) and some form of spread crossing costs .",
    "we show that when the market participants are risk neutral or have cara utility functions the pricing game has a unique nash equilibrium in the class of absolutely continuous trading strategies ; existence results for more general utility functions are given for the one player case .",
    "we solve the problem of equilibrium pricing using techniques from the theory of stochastic optimal control and stochastic differential games .",
    "we show that the family of the players value functions can be characterized as the solution to a coupled system of non - linear pdes . here",
    "we use a - priori estimates for nash equilibria ; we prove that the system of pdes has a unique classical solution with bounded derivatives .",
    "it turns out that the equilibrium problem can be solved in closed form for a specific market environment , namely the linear cost structure used in almgren & chriss ( 2001 ) and risk neutral agents .",
    "we use this explicit solutions to state some conditions which make manipulation unattractive or avoid it altogether .",
    "for instance , we show that when the agents are risk neutral no market manipulation occurs in zero sum games , i.e. , in a game between an option writer and an option issuer .",
    "furthermore , we find that the bid ask spread is important determinant of market manipulation .",
    "it turns out that the higher the spread , the less beneficial market manipulation : high spread crossing costs make trading more costly and hence discourage frequent re - balancing of portfolio positions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we present the market model in section 2 . in chapter 3",
    ", we formulate the optimization problem , derive a priori estimates for nash equilibria and prove the existence of a solution for one player with general utility function .",
    "we solve the multi - player case in section 4 for risk neutral and cara agents .",
    "we use these solutions in chapter 5 to show how market manipulation can be reduced .",
    "section 6 concludes .",
    "we adopt the market impact model of schoeneborn & schied ( 2007 ) with a finite set @xmath0 of _ agents _ , or _ players _ , trading a single stock whose price process depends on the agent s trading strategies . following almgren & chriss ( 2001 )",
    "we shall assume that the players have a permanent impact on asset prices and that all trades are settled at prevailing market prices plus a liquidity premium which depends on the _ change _ in the players portfolios . in order to be able to capture changes in portfolio positions in an analytically tractable way",
    ", we follow almgren & chriss ( 2001 ) and schoeneborn & schied ( 2007 ) and restrict ourselves to absolutely continuous trading strategies .",

    "we write @xmath5 and call @xmath6 the _ trading speed _ of the player @xmath7 .",
    "our focus is on valuation schemes for derivatives with short maturities under strategic market interactions . for short trading periods",
    "it is appropriate to model the _ fundamental stock price _ , i.e. , the value of the stock in the absence of any market impact , as a brownian motion with volatility @xmath8 .",
    "market impact is accounted for by assuming that the investors accumulated stock holdings @xmath9 have a linear impact on the stock process @xmath10 so that @xmath11 with a permanent impact parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the linear permanent impact is consistent with the work of huberman & stanzl ( 2004 ) who argued that linearity of the permanent price impact is important to exclude quasi - arbitrage .",
    "a trade at time @xmath13 $ ] is settled at a _ transaction price _ @xmath14 that includes an additional instantaneous price impact , or _ liquidity premium_. specifically , @xmath15 with a _ cost function _ @xmath16 that depends on the instantaneous change @xmath17 in the agents position in a possibly non - linear manner .",
    "the liquidity premium accounts for limited available liquidity , transaction costs , fees , spread crossing costs , etc .",
    "spread - crossing costs are of particular importance and have not been considered in the previous literature on market impact .    in our model",
    "the liquidity costs are the same for all traders and depend only on the aggregate demand throughout the entire set of agents .",
    "this captures situations where the agents trade through a market maker or clearing house that reduces the trading costs by collecting all orders and matching incoming demand and supply prior to settling the outstanding balance @xmath18 at market prices .",
    "we assume with no loss of generality that @xmath16 is normalized , i.e. , @xmath19 and smooth .",

    "the first condition is natural for a cost function . since the liquidity costs associated with a net change in the overall position @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 , the second assumption states that the agents face increasing marginal costs of trading .",
    "our assumptions on @xmath16 are satisfied for the following important examples :    cost functions which satisfy assumption [ assumption_g ] are the linear cost function @xmath25 with @xmath26 , used in almgren & chriss ( 2001 ) and cost functions of the form @xmath27 the former is the cost function associated with a block - shaped limit order book .",

    "is initially endowed with a contingent claim @xmath30 , whose payoff depends on the stock price @xmath31 at maturity . although it is not always necessary we assume that the functions @xmath32 are smooth and bounded with bounded derivatives @xmath33 .",
    "we only consider options with cash delivery .",
    "the assumption of cash delivery is key .",
    "while cash settlement is susceptible to market manipulation , we show in section 5 below that when deals are settled physically , i.e. , when the option issuer delivers the underlying , market manipulation is not beneficial : the cost of acquiring at an increased price outweighs the benefits from a possible higher option payoff , due to an increase in the underlying .",
    "we model the risk preference of the agent @xmath34 with a von neumann - morgenstern utility function @xmath35 and assume that her aim is to maximize her expected portfolio value at maturity from trading in the financial market so the agent s optimization problem is given by : @xmath36          .\\ ] ] the portfolio value consists of the trading costs @xmath37 , the option payoff @xmath38 and the liquidation value @xmath39 of @xmath40 stock shares at maturity . rigorously defining a form of liquidation value in a multi - player framework",

    "the problem of defining a liquidation value in a single - player framework has been solved in a recent paper by schoeneborn & schied ( 2008 ) ; in a game - theoretic setting the problem is much more involved .",

    "then the aggregate trading speed is @xmath177 .    if @xmath176 then ( [ speed ] ) and ( [ cum_solution_rn ] ) imply that the aggregate value function @xmath127 equals zero .",
    "it follows from ( [ speed ] ) that the aggregate trading speed vanishes .    loosely speaking in a zero - sum game , if all option traders are risk neutral and willing to move the market in their favor , their combined effect cancels .",
    "we note that this is no longer true for general utility functions , as illustrated in figure [ bild_2p_cara_call ] .",
    "of course , in reality market manipulation is illegal and many investors are unable to manipulate the underlying in the first place .",
    "this is why we now look at the following asymmetric situation : the option issuer , player 0 , does not trade the underlying ; her competitor , player 1 , owns the derivative @xmath178 and intends to move the stock price to her favor .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath179 informed investors without option endowment in the market",
    ". they are  predators  that may supply liquidity and thus reduce the first player s market impact , cf .",
    "carlin , lobo & viswanathan ( 2007 ) and schoeneborn & schied ( 2007 ) .",
    "we find that the more informed competitors are active , the less aggregate manipulation will occur .",
    "let @xmath178 and @xmath180 for @xmath181 . then @xmath182    the solution @xmath130 to the cauchy problem ( [ cum_solution_rn ] ) with terminal condition @xmath183 is bounded uniformly in @xmath121 .",
    "equation ( [ speed ] ) yields @xmath184    let us modify the preceding setting a little .",
    "again , player 0 issues a product @xmath119 and does not intend to manipulate the underlying , while her competitors do .",
    "more precisely , assume that player @xmath185 splits the product @xmath119 into pieces and sells them to @xmath121 risk neutral competitors , such that each of them gets @xmath186 .",
    "we find that their aggregate trading speed @xmath187 is decreasing in the number of competitors @xmath121 .",
    "consequently , the option issuer should sell her product to as many investors as possible in order to avoid being outsmarted .",
    "we illustrate this result in figure [ np_rn_call_cumspeed ] , which shows the aggregate trading speed at time @xmath147 of @xmath121 players each holding @xmath188 option shares .",
    "let @xmath189 for @xmath190 .",
    "then for each @xmath191 $ ] the aggregate trading speed @xmath192 is decreasing in @xmath121 and @xmath193    as in the preceding corollary , the assertion follows from equations ( [ cum_solution_rn ] ) and ( [ speed ] ) .",
    "+    the preceding results indicate how an option issuer can prevent her competitors from manipulation .",
    "one strategy is public announcement of the transaction : the more informed liquidity suppliers on the market , the smaller the impact on the underlying .",
    "a second strategy is splitting the product into pieces ; the more option writers , the less manipulation .",
    "let us conclude this section with a surprisingly simple way to avoid manipulation : using options with physical delivery .",
    "calls , puts and forwards with physical delivery do not induce stock price manipulation .    consider a risk neutral agent who owns @xmath194 call options with physical delivery and strike @xmath195 .",
    "as above , we denote by @xmath86 her strategy in the underlying . at maturity",
    ", she exercises @xmath196 of her call options .",
    "problem ( [ problem ] ) turns into : @xmath197 \\\\          & = & \\sup _ { x \\in { \\mathfrak{x } } , \\theta \\leq \\theta } { \\mathbb{e}}\\left [ \\int_0^t - \\kappa \\dot x_t^2 dt + \\theta \\left ( p_t - \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda \\theta \\right ) - \\theta k   \\right ] \\\\          & = & \\sup _ { x \\in { \\mathfrak{x } } } { \\mathbb{e}}\\left [ \\int_0^t - \\kappa \\dot x_t^2 dt \\right ] + \\sup _ { \\theta \\leq \\theta } \\left [ \\theta \\left ( p_t - \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda \\theta \\right ) - \\theta k \\right ] \\\\          & = & \\sup _ { \\theta \\leq \\theta } \\left [ \\theta \\left ( p_t - \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda \\theta \\right ) - \\theta k \\right ]      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term in the first line describes the expected trading costs in @xmath42 $ ] and the liquidation value of @xmath198 stock shares at maturity .",
    "the optimal trading strategy is @xmath199 .",
    "the same holds true for put options and forward options with physical delivery .",
    "we investigated the strategic behavior of option holders in illiquid markets .",
    "if trading the underlying has a permanent impact on the stock price , the possession of derivatives with cash delivery may induce market manipulation .",
    "we showed the existence and uniqueness of optimal trading strategies in continuous time and for a general cost function ; in the one player framework for general utility functions , and in the multi - player case for risk neutral as well as cara investors .",
    "moreover , we showed how market manipulation can be reduced .",
    "our work may be extended in several directions .",
    "foremost , we derived our results under assumption [ assumption ] .",
    "this assumption is only satisfied in the single - player risk - neutral case where the expected costs of buying a portfolio over a finite time interval under market impact equals its expected liquidation value under infinitely slow liquidation and does not hold in general . the problem of defining a proper notion of liquidation value under strategic interaction is important but was not our focus and is left for future research .",
    "furthermore , it would be interesting to consider american or path - dependent options as well as more sophisticated market impact models such as obizhaeva & wang ( 2006 ) that account for resilience effects and temporary price impacts .",
    "in this section , we prove propositions [ prop_existence_rn ] and [ prop_existence_cara ] where the pde ( [ system_rn ] ) in the risk neutral setting is a special case of the system ( [ hjb_exp_transformed ] ) for risk averse agents , with @xmath200 for each @xmath7 . in order to establish our existence and uniqueness of equilibrium result",
