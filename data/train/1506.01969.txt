    "<S> the chains may be staggered or not in - plane due to complexity of the fe - pb interface . </S>",
    "<S> a staggered and not - in - plane configuration can generically bring about additional hopping couplings which also contribute to the symmetry reduction from the second type of bdi class to d class . secondly , it was shown that the strong coupling between the fe atoms and the substrate pb atoms can strongly renormalize the fermi velocities of the fe bands  @xcite . this effect is essentially because the transverse wave functions ( penetrating into the substrate sc ) of fe electrons have strong dependence on the momentum @xmath102 due to the interface couplings , which greatly suppresses the dependence of energies on @xmath102 . nonetheless , if the interface couplings between fe and pb atoms do not break the tr symmetries @xmath31 and @xmath48 defined in the present work , the main results predicted here shall not be affected by the renormalization of fermi velocities . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed study of this effect will be performed in the next work . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the long - range hopping couplings along the chain and transverse direction do not affect the tr symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , taking into account hopping couplings between fe atoms with even larger distance does not change our results .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the superconducting phase diagram and boundary modes for a quasi-1d system formed by three fe - chains on an s - wave sc . </S>",
    "<S> we uncovered a nontrivial symmetry reduction mechanism with two different types of bdi classes ( characterized by @xmath103 invariant ) reduced to d classes ( with @xmath44 invariant ) by the onsite @xmath0 term for @xmath4-orbital electrons , inter - chain diagonal hopping , and magnetic disorder couplings , which governs the properties of boundary modes in the topologically nontrivial or trivial phases . </S>",
    "<S> for the topological regime a single majorana and multiple andreew bound modes are obtained in each end of the chain , while for the trivial phase only low - energy andreev bound states survive . </S>",
    "<S> our results call for further experimental studies to identify the mzms out of low - energy abss .    .    </S>",
