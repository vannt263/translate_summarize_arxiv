    "understanding the formation mechanisms and evolution with cosmic time of galaxies is one of the major goals of observational cosmology . in the current picture of structure formation ,",
    "dark matter halos build up in a hierarchical fashion controlled by the nature of the dark matter , the power spectrum of density fluctuations , and the parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "the assembly of the stellar content of galaxies is governed by much more complicated physics , such as the mechanisms of star formation , gaseous dissipation , the feedback of stellar and central supermassive black hole energetic output on the baryonic material of the galaxies , and mergers .",
    "the mean space density of galaxies per unit luminosity , or luminosity function ( lf ) , is one of the most fundamental of all cosmological observables , and it is one of the most basic descriptors of a galaxy population .",
    "the shape of the lf retains the imprint of galaxy formation and evolution processes ; the evolution of the lf as a function of cosmic time , galaxy type and environment provides insights into the physical processes that govern the assembly and the following evolution of galaxies .",
    "therefore , the lf represents one of the fundamental observational tools to constrain the free parameters of theoretical models .",
    "the local ( @xmath6 ) lf has been very well determined from several wide - area , multi - wave band surveys with follow - up spectroscopy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath16 )",
    ", spectroscopic surveys found a steepening of the faint - end lf with increasing redshift in the global lf , mainly due to the contribution by later type galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . from the combo-17 survey",
    ", @xcite measured the rest - frame optical lf up to @xmath17 , finding that early - type galaxies show a decrease of a factor of @xmath18 in the characteristic density @xmath8 of the lf .",
    "the latest type galaxies show a brightening of @xmath19  mag in @xmath20 ( the characteristic magnitude ) and an increase of @xmath21 in @xmath8 in their highest redshift bin in the blue band .",
    "further progress in the measurement of the lf at @xmath22 was obtained with the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds ; @xcite ) and the deep-2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite . from the vvds data",
    ", @xcite measured the rest - frame optical lf from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . from the same data set , @xcite performed a similar analysis for different spectral galaxy types , finding a significant steepening of the lf going from early to late types .",
    "their results indicate a strong type - dependent evolution of the lf , and identify the latest spectral types as responsible for most of the evolution of the uv - optical lf out to @xmath25 .",
    "contrary to low - redshift studies , the selection of high - redshift ( @xmath5 ) galaxies still largely relies on their colors .",
    "one of the most efficient ways to select high - redshift galaxies is the lyman drop - out technique , which enabled steidel and collaborators to build large samples of @xmath26 star - forming galaxies ( @xcite , 1999 )",
    ". extensive studies of these optically ( rest - frame ultraviolet ) selected galaxies at @xmath26 ( lyman break galaxies [ lbgs ] ) and at @xmath27 ( bm / bx galaxies ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that they are typically characterized by low extinction , modest ages , stellar masses @xmath28  m@xmath29 , and star formation rates of 10100  m@xmath29yr@xmath30 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recovered the rest - frame @xmath1-band lf of lbgs at @xmath26 from the rest - frame uv lf ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) , finding that the lbg lf is characterized by a very steep faint end .",
    "lbgs dominate the uv luminosity density at @xmath31 , as well as possibly the global star formation rate density at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "however , since the lyman break selection technique requires galaxies to be very bright in the rest - frame uv in order to be selected , it might miss galaxies that are heavily obscured by dust or whose light is dominated by evolved stellar populations .",
    "these objects can be selected in the near - infrared ( nir ) , which corresponds to the rest - frame optical out to @xmath26 . using the nir selection criterion @xmath32 ( also suggested by @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite discovered a new population of high - redshift galaxies ( distant red galaxies [ drgs ] ) that would be largely missed by optically selected surveys .",
    "follow - up studies have shown that drgs constitute a heterogeneous population .",
    "they are mostly actively forming stars at @xmath33 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however ,",
    "some show no signs of active star formation and appear to be passively evolving ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while others seem to host powerful active galactic nuclei ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "compared to lbgs , drgs have systematically older ages and larger masses @xcite , although some overlap between the two exists ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated that in a mass - selected sample ( @xmath34  @xmath35 ) at @xmath36 , drgs make up 77% in mass , compared to only 17% from lbgs ( see also @xcite ) , implying that the rest - frame optical lf determined by @xcite is incomplete .",
    "the global ( i.e. , including all galaxy types ) rest - frame optical lf at @xmath5 can be studied by combining multiwavelength catalogs with photometric redshift information .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath0-band lfs of red and blue galaxies .",
    "they find that the @xmath0-band number densities of red and blue galaxies have different evolution , with a strong decrease of the red population at @xmath37 compared to @xmath38 and a corresponding increase of the blue population , in broad agreement with the predictions from their hierarchical cold dark matter models . as all previous works at @xmath5",
    "are based on either very deep photometry but small total survey area ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or larger but still single field surveys ( @xcite ) , their results are strongly affected by field - to - field variations and by low number statistics , especially at the bright end .",
    "moreover , @xcite used an i - band  selected data set from the fors deep field .",
    "the @xmath39 band corresponds to the rest - frame uv at @xmath27 , which means that significant extrapolation is required .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the deep nir musyc survey to measure the rest - frame optical ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 band ) lfs of galaxies at @xmath3 . its unique combination of surveyed area and depth allows us to ( 1 ) minimize the effects of field - to - field variations , ( 2 ) better probe the bright end of the lf with good statistics , and ( 3 ) sample the lf down to luminosities @xmath40  mag fainter than the characteristic magnitude . to constrain the faint - end slope of the lf and to increase the statistics , we also made use of the fires and the goods - cdfs surveys , by constructing a composite sample .",
    "the large number of galaxies in our composite sample also allows us to measure the lfs of several subsamples of galaxies , such as drgs and non - drgs ( defined based on their observed @xmath15 color ) , and of intrinsically red and blue galaxies ( defined based on their rest - frame @xmath12 color ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in   [ sec - cs ]",
    "we present the composite sample used to measure the lf of galaxies at @xmath3 ; in   [ sec - lf ] we describe the methods applied to measure the lf and discuss the uncertainties in the measured lf due to field - to - field variations and errors in the photometric redshift estimates ; the results ( of all galaxies and of the individual subsamples considered in this work ) are presented in   [ sec - results ] , while the estimates of the number and luminosity densities and the contribution of drgs ( red galaxies ) to the global stellar mass density are given in   [ sec - densities ] .",

    "we constructed a composite sample of high - redshift ( @xmath95 ) galaxies to be used in the estimate of the lf in   [ sec - lf ] . a large composite sample with a wide range of luminosities is required to sample both the faint and the bright end of the lf well ;",
    "moreover , a large surveyed area is necessary to account for sample variance .",

    "@xmath144% have spectroscopic redshifts . in figure  [ fig2_ref ]",
    "we show the rest - frame @xmath0-band absolute magnitude versus the redshift for the composite sample in the studied redshift range @xmath3 .",
    "to estimate the observed lf in the case of a composite sample , we have applied an extended version of the @xmath100 algorithm @xcite as defined in @xcite so that several samples can be combined in one calculation . for a given redshift interval [ @xmath101,@xmath102 , we computed the galaxy number density @xmath103 in each magnitude bin @xmath104 in the following way :    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the number of objects in the chosen bin and @xmath107 is :    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the area in units of steradians corresponding to the @xmath110th field , @xmath111 is the number of samples combined together , @xmath112 is the comoving volume element per steradian , and @xmath113 is the minimum of @xmath114 and the maximum redshift at which the @xmath115th object could have been observed within the magnitude limit of the @xmath110th sample .",
    "the poisson error in each magnitude bin was computed adopting the recipe of @xcite valid also for small numbers .",
    "the @xmath100 estimator has the advantages of simplicity and no a priori assumption of a functional form for the luminosity distribution ; it also yields a fully normalized solution .",
    "however , it can be affected by the presence of clustering in the sample , leading to a poor estimate of the faint - end slope of the lf .",
    "although field - to - field variation represents a significant source of uncertainty in deep surveys ( since they are characterized by very small areas and hence small sampled volumes ) , the majority of published cosmological number densities and related quantities do not properly account for sample variance in their quoted error budgets .",
    "our composite sample is made of several independent fields with a large total effective area of @xmath116  arcmin@xmath52 ( about a factor of 3 larger than the nominal area of the @xmath45-selected cdfs - goods catalog used in @xcite ) , which significantly reduces the uncertainties due to sample variance .",
    "also , the large number of fields considered in this work with their large individual areas allows us to empirically measure the field - to - field variations from one field to the other in the estimate of the lf with the @xmath100 method , especially at the bright end , and to properly account for it in the error budget .    in order to quantify the uncertainties due to field - to - field variations in the determination of the lf",
    ", we proceeded as follows .",
    "first , for each magnitude bin @xmath104 , we measured @xmath117 for each individual @xmath110th field using equation  ( [ eq-1vmax ] ) . for each magnitude bin with @xmath118 , we estimated the contribution to the error budget of @xmath119 from sample variance using : @xmath120 with @xmath111 the number of individual fields used .",
    "for the magnitude bins with @xmath121 ( usually the brightest bin and the 3 - 4 faintest ones ) , we adopted the mean of the @xmath122 with @xmath118 . the final 1  @xmath54 error associated to @xmath119",
    "is then @xmath123 , with @xmath124 the poisson error in each magnitude bin .",
    "we also measured the observed lf using the sty method @xcite , which is a parametric maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "the sty method has been shown to be unbiased with respect to density inhomogeneities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it has well - defined asymptotic error properties ( e.g. @xcite ) , and does not require binning of the data .",
    "the sty method assumes that @xmath119 has a universal form , i.e. , the number density of galaxies is separable into a function of luminosity times a function of position : @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the shape of @xmath119 is determined independently of its normalization .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath119 is described by a @xcite function ,    @xmath126 { } \\nonumber\\\\   \\times \\exp{\\big [ -10^{0.4(m^{\\star}-m ) } \\big]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath127 is the faint - end slope parameter , @xmath20 is the characteristic absolute magnitude at which the lf exhibits a rapid change in the slope , and @xmath8 is the normalization .",
    "the probability of seeing a galaxy of absolute magnitude @xmath128 at redshift @xmath129 in a magnitude - limited catalog is given by    @xmath130    where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the faintest and brightest absolute magnitudes observable at the redshift @xmath129 in a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "the likelihood @xmath133 ( where the product extends over all galaxies in the sample ) is maximized with respect to the parameters @xmath127 and @xmath20 describing the lf @xmath103 .",
    "the best - fit solution is obtained by minimizing @xmath134 .",
    "a simple and accurate method of estimating errors is to determine the ellipsoid of parameter values defined by @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the @xmath137-point of the @xmath138 distribution with @xmath139 degrees of freedom .",
    "parameter @xmath136 is chosen in the standard way depending on the desired confidence level in the estimate ( as described , e.g. , by @xcite ; @xcite ) : @xmath140 , 6.2 , and 11.8 to estimate @xmath141 error contours with 68% , 95% , and 99% confidence level ( 1 , 2 , and 3  @xmath54 , respectively ) .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is then obtained by imposing a normalization on the best - fit lf such that the total number of observed galaxies in the composite sample is reproduced .",
    "the 1 , 2 , and 3  @xmath54 errors on @xmath8 are estimated from the minimum and maximum values of @xmath8 allowed by the 1 , 2 , and 3  @xmath54 confidence contours in the @xmath141 parameter space , respectively .",
    "studies of high - redshift galaxies still largely rely on photometric redshift estimates .",
    "it is therefore important to understand how the photometric redshift uncertainties affect the derived lf and to quantify the systematic effects on the lf best - fit parameters .",
    "@xcite have shown that at lower redshifts ( @xmath142 ) the measurement of the lf is strongly affected by errors associated with @xmath143 .",
    "specifically , large redshift errors together with the steep slope at the bright end of the galaxy lf tend to flatten the observed lf and result in measured @xmath20 systematically brighter than the intrinsic value , since there are more intrinsically faint galaxies scattered into the bright end of the lf than intrinsically bright galaxies scattered into the faint end .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , @xcite obtained a best - fit @xmath20 that was 0.8  mag brighter than the intrinsic value in the redshift range @xmath144 .    in order to quantify the systematic effect on the lf parameters @xmath127 and @xmath20 in our redshift range of interest ( @xmath3 )",
    ", we performed a series of monte carlo simulations .",
    "the details of these simulations and the results are presented in appendix  [ app-1 ] .",
    "briefly , we generated several model catalogs of galaxies of different brightness according to an input schechter lf , extracted the redshifts of the objects from a probability distribution proportional to the comoving volume per unit redshift ( @xmath112 ) , and obtained the final mock catalogs after applying a limit in the observed apparent magnitude .",
    "to simulate the errors in the redshifts , we assumed a redshift error function parametrized as a gaussian distribution function of 1 @xmath54 width @xmath145 , with @xmath146 being the scatter in @xmath147 , and we formed the observed redshift catalog by perturbing the input galaxy redshift within the redshift error function .",
    "finally , we determined the lf for the galaxies at @xmath148 using the @xmath100 and maximum likelihood methods described in  ",
    "[ sec-1vmaxmeth ] and [ sec - stymeth ] , respectively .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app-1 ] , the systematic effects on the measured @xmath127 and @xmath20 in the redshift interval @xmath3 are negligible with respect to the other uncertainties in the lf estimate if the errors on the photometric redshifts are characterized by a scatter in @xmath147 of @xmath149 , which is the appropriate value for the @xmath150 sample considered in this work .",
    "this is not true at @xmath151 , where we find large systematic effects on both @xmath20 and @xmath127 , consistent with @xcite .",
    "as explained in detail in appendix  [ app-1 ] , the large systematic effects found at @xmath151 arise from the strong redshift dependency of both @xmath112 and @xmath152 at low-@xmath153 ; at @xmath5 these dependencies are much less steep , and this results in smaller systematic effects on the measured lf . from the monte carlo simulations we also quantified that the effects of photometric redshift errors on the estimated luminosity density are typically a few percent ( always @xmath154% ) .",
    "we conclude that the parameters of the lf and the luminosity density estimates presented in this work are not significantly affected by the uncertainties in the photometric redshift estimates we also investigated the effects of non - gaussian redshift error probability distributions .",
    "systematic outliers in the photometric redshift distribution can potentially cause systematic errors in the lf measurements , although these are much smaller than the random uncertainties in the lf estimates ( if the outliers are randomly distributed ) . ] . in order to include this contribution in the error budget , we conservatively assume a 10% error contribution to the luminosity density error budget due to uncertainties in the photometric redshift estimates .",
    "in this section we present the results of the measurement of the lf of galaxies at @xmath150 .",
    "we have measured the global lf in the rest - frame @xmath2 and @xmath1 band at redshift @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig - filters ] , at these redshifts , the rest - frame @xmath2 and @xmath1 bands correspond approximately to the observed @xmath45 band , which is the selection band of the composite sample .",

    "[ fig - mc_mvsz ] with cyan and green filled circles ) ; since at the bright end the number of objects is very small , even a handful of new sources can significantly increase the measured density with respect to the intrinsic one . because at low redshifts the dependency of @xmath152 with redshift is strong , even small uncertainties in the redshift estimate have large effects on the rest - frame absolute magnitude .",

    "also , at @xmath5 , the error on the rest - frame absolute magnitude corresponding to a redshift error is significantly smaller than at @xmath151 ; e.g. , @xmath602  mag for @xmath603 at @xmath587 .",
    "therefore , the measured lf is similar to the input one and the systematic effects on @xmath127 and @xmath20 are negligible compared to the uncertainties in the lf estimates for reasonable values of @xmath146 ( @xmath604 ) .",
    "we repeated the above monte carlo simulations assuming different input @xmath127 ( @xmath605 , @xmath606 , and @xmath607 ) to study the behavior of the systematic effects as function of the faint - end slope .",
    "no significant differences are found : @xmath608  mag for @xmath609 and @xmath607 ( depending on the considered redshift bin ) ; for @xmath610 , the systematic effect is slightly larger ( @xmath611  mag for @xmath155 and @xmath162 , respectively ) , but also the uncertainties on the best - fit @xmath20 increase with steeper faint - end slopes ( since the observed lf appears more like a power law ) so that the systematic effects on the measured best - fit schechter parameters remain very small with respect to the uncertainties on the best - fit values .    finally , we investigated the effects of non - gaussian redshift error probability distributions .",
    "first , using a model catalog with galaxies at redshifts between @xmath612 and @xmath592 , we simulated the effect of a 5% `` catastrophic '' outliers by assigning random redshifts to 5% of the mock catalog . adopting the input lf with @xmath593 and @xmath613 and assuming @xmath595 , we find larger systematic effect in both @xmath127 and @xmath20 by a factor of almost 2 . next",
    ", we built the mean redshift probability distribution of the deep nir musyc by averaging the individual redshift probability distribution for each galaxy calculated by the used photometric redshift code ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the average musyc redshift probability distribution is well modeled by a lorentzian function , rather than a gaussian function .",
    "we find a larger systematic effect in @xmath127 , twice as much as the corresponding effect assuming a gaussian parametrization for the redshift probability distribution , but similar systematic effect in @xmath20 , although in the opposite direction .",
    "to summarize , although the systematic effects in @xmath127 and @xmath20 expectedly get larger when we simulate `` catastrophic '' outliers or we adopt a redshift error function with broader wings compared to the gaussian model , they remain much smaller than the random uncertainties in the lf estimates .",
    "we also quantified the systematic effect on the luminosity density estimates .",
    "we find that the effect is of the order of a few percent ( always @xmath6146% ) depending on the considered redshift interval and on the input schechter lf .    in order to include this contribution in the error budget ,",
    "we conservatively assume a 10% error contribution to the luminosity density error budget due to uncertainties in the photometric redshift estimates .",
    "in the body of the paper we showed the rest - frame @xmath2 band lfs of drgs , non - drgs , red and blue galaxies ( see fig .  [ lf_r_lowz.ps ] ) . for completeness",

    "the corresponding best - fit schechter parameters are listed in table  [ tab-4 ] .",
    "here we compare our results to previous rest - frame optical lf studies at @xmath5 , which were based on smaller samples .",
    "we note that these studies are affected by significant uncertainties due to field - to - field variance ( as they are based on a single field or on a very small total surveyed area ) and by small number statistics at the bright end .",
    "@xcite analyzed a sample of 138 @xmath4-selected galaxies down to @xmath615 to construct the rest - frame @xmath0-band lf in the redshift range @xmath616 .",

    "a direct comparison between the lfs of @xcite and @xcite and the lf measured in this work is shown in figure  [ fig - poli ] ( _ left panel _ ) for the redshift range @xmath619 .",
    "first , we note in figure  [ fig - poli ] how much better the bright end of the lf is constrained from our work : the large area of the composite sample ( @xmath620% of which comes from the deep nir musyc alone ) allows us to sample the lf up to @xmath0-band magnitudes @xmath621  mag brighter than done in @xcite and @xcite . our measurements of the lf using the @xmath100 method are consistent within the errors with those in both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the best - fit lf estimated with the maximum likelihood analysis in @xcite is consistent , within the errors , with our best - fit solution .",
    "however , the best - fit lf estimated with the maximum likelihood analysis in @xcite is significantly different from ours , as clearly shown in the inset of figure  [ fig - poli ] ( _ left panel _ ) . while their faint - end slope is consistent with our best - fit @xmath127 , their lack of constraints on the bright end of the lf results in a much fainter @xmath183 ( by @xmath240  mag ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed a sample of 5558 @xmath39-selected galaxies down to @xmath622 ( 50% compleness limit ) from the fdf survey @xcite to study the evolution of the rest - frame @xmath0- and @xmath250-band lf over the redshift range @xmath623 .",

    "this difference can be entirely accounted for by field - to - field variations ( see   [ sec - numdens ] ) .",
    "in fact , the fdf survey consists of a single pointing of only @xmath624  arcmin@xmath52 and thus it is potentially strongly affected by sample variance .",
    "moreover , @xcite spectroscopically identified an overdensity of galaxies at @xmath565 ( possibly a [ proto]cluster , with more than 10 identical redshifts ) , which can potentially strongly bias the estimate of @xmath8 in this redshift bin .    in the right panel of figure  [ fig - poli ]",
