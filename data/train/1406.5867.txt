    "in recent years , classical behavior of non - hermitian hamiltonian systems@xcite as well as classical motion of hermitian systems for complex energies@xcite have attracted much interest .",
    "investigation of classical mechanics in the complex domain is useful for understanding various classical and quantum mechanical phenomena such as barrier tunneling , dynamical tunneling@xcite , classical and quantum chaos@xcite , quantum correspondence principle , complex forms of uncertainty relations and the semiclassical limit of complex quantum field theories .    since the earlier work on classical motion of non - hermitian systems @xcite , there have been several interesting results found on the various aspects of the subject@xcite .",
    "numerical and analytical investigations have revealed that when energies are real , classical trajectories of complex @xmath3-symmetric non hermitian systems are closed and periodic . however , when energies of these systems are complex , the periodic trajectories usually become non periodic and open@xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that even though most of the trajectories corresponding to complex energies are open and non periodic , for some systems , there are special discrete sets of curves in the complex - energy plane for which the trajectories are periodic@xcite . on the other hand , in non - hermitian and",
    "non @xmath3-symmetric hamiltonian systems , even for real energies , almost all trajectories except a few are non - periodic and open .",
    "it was also shown recently that when time is taken as a complex quantity with a specific fixed phase angle or as a specific complex function , non periodic trajectories of 1-d hamiltonian systems become periodic and closed@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the classical trajectories from a different point of view . here",
    "we examine clasical behavior of the complex hamiltonian @xmath4 , ( where @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 is real such that @xmath16 is not @xmath3-symmetric ) for complex parameter @xmath6 and real energy @xmath17 .",
    "outline of the paper is as follows . in the section [ sec:2 ] , analytic expressions for complex trajectories",
    "are derived.expressions for periods of the periodic trajectories as well as time taken by unbounded trajectories to escape to infinity are found in terms of @xmath6 and energy @xmath17 .",
    "we will show that for given real energy , the classical trajectories of the above quartic hamiltonian are open except for a discrete set of parameter values in the complex @xmath6-plane .",
    "in section [ sec:3 ] we study how trajectories behave when energy is real and @xmath6 is a fixed complex parameter .",
    "the classical trajectories of complex hamiltonian @xmath10 ( @xmath18 is investigated for real energies in section [ sec:4 ] and concluding remarks are given in section [ sec:5 ] .",

    "note that @xmath20 in the above equation is still a solution of ( [ eq:3 ] ) , when @xmath25 and @xmath37 are cyclically changed ( e.g. @xmath38 ) . in order to understand how the trajectories behave ,",
