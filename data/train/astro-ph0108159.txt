    "in contrast with the early , simple idea that dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies were systems essentially consisting of old , globular cluster - like , population ii stars ( baade 1963 ) , they have been revealed as objects having undertaken complex star formation processes during their lives ( mighell & rich 1996 ; hurley - keller , mateo , & nemec 1998 ; stetson , hesser , & smecker - hane 1998 ; martnez - delgado , gallart , & aparicio 1999 ; gallart _ et al .  _",
    "indications that dsphs could contain some intermediate - age or young stars were early found by baade & swope ( 1961 ) . since then",
    ", other proofs have been accumulated , such as the presence of carbon stars ( aaronson & mould 1980 ; mould _ et al .  _ 1982 ; frogel _ et al .",
    "_ 1982 ; azzopardi , lequeux , & westerlund 1986 ) and bright agb stars ( elston & silva 1992 ; freedman 1992 ; lee , freedman , & madore 1993 ; davidge 1994 ; but see also martnez - delgado & aparicio 1997 ) .",
    "stellar evolution theory became increasingly important in the interpretation of the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) when these reached the turn - offs of intermediate - age and old stars ( see mould & aaronson 1983 and mighell 1997 for the carina dsph and aparicio 1998 for a review ) .",
    "comparison with theoretical isochrones allowed the determination of the range of ages present in the galaxies .",
    "dsph galaxies were studied with these techniques and the idea that all them , in one way or another , have a composite stellar population and that no two dsphs could be identified to have similar star formation histories ( sfhs ) became popular . in later years ,",
    "the most powerful way to obtain the sfh , namely the analysis of the cmd with synthetic cmds computed from a stellar evolution library ( aparicio 2001 ) , has confirmed the wide variety of scenarios and has revealed complex , frequently bursting sfhs in dsphs ( hurley - keller _ et al .  _ 1998 ; mighell 1997 ; martnez - delgado _ et al .",

    "1999b ; hernndez , gilmore , & valls - gabaud 2000 ; aparicio 2001 ) .",
    "structurally , dsphs are usually well fitted by king models , although exponential fittings are also adequate ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) .",
    "they show relatively small scale lengths and have low central surface brightness ( gallagher & wise 1994 ) .",
    "they are the least - massive galaxies known , but still , their velocity dispersions imply mass - to - luminosity relations , @xmath14 , as large as @xmath15 .",
    "this is usually explained as dsphs containing large amounts of dark matter , but whether or not they are really bound systems ( gallagher & wise 1994 ) and whether or not the large values of @xmath14 are due to peculiar orientation in space ( kroupa 1997 ; klessen & kroupa 1998 ) is still subject of discussion .",
    "what is clear is that at least some dsphs , such as sagittarius ( mateo , olszewski , & morrison 1998 ; martnez - delgado _ et al .  _",
    "2001a ) or ursa minor ( martnez - delgado _ et al .  _",
    "2001b ) show evidences of undergoing a process of tidal disruption by the milky way .",
    "this would eventually be related to the galaxy formation predicted in cold dark matter scenarios , in which dwarf galaxies would be the first to form and would subsequently be merged into larger systems ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "several efforts have been devoted to the study of draco .",
    "it was discovered by wilson ( 1955 ) and was the subject of a careful photographic analysis leading to its first cmd by baade & swope ( 1961 ) .",
    "they found several rr lyrae variables and noticed that the horizontal branch ( hb ) was predominantly populated in the red part but also had a blue component .",
    "they were also the first to find anomalous cepheids , later on identified in other dsph galaxies .",
    "stetson ( 1979a ) published new photographic photometry and estimated the distance modulus to be @xmath16 from the magnitude of the hb .",
    "deeper cmds were obtained by stetson , vandenbergh , & mcclure ( 1985 ) , who reached the turn - off of the dominant , old population about 3.5 mag below the hb .",
    "carney & seitzer ( 1986 ) found unambiguous evidence of a blue plume of stars above the main turn - off , as well as possible traces of an 8 gyr - old stellar population .",
    "recently , grillmair _ et al .  _",
    "( 1998 ) have presented wfpc2 _ hst _ photometry that allows the ms luminosity function down to 3 mag below the oldest turn - off to be determined .    the stellar density distribution of draco was early studied by hodge ( 1964 ) and , more recently , by irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) who report a tidal radius of @xmath17 and by lake ( 1990 ) , pryor & kormendi ( 1990 ) and piatek _ et al .  _",
    "( 2001 ) who find evidences of a larger extension of the galaxy .",
    "draco s metallicity has been found to be very low . from the color of the rgb ,",
    "carney & seitzer ( 1986 ) estimated it to be [ fe / h ] @xmath18 with a dispersion of 0.8 dex .",
    "this is in good agreement with spectroscopic results for several giant stars , which lead to @xmath19<-1.5 $ ] ( stetson 1984 ; shetrone , bolte , & stetson 1998 ) ; @xmath20=-1.9\\pm 0.4 $ ] ( lehnert _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) or @xmath20=-2.00\\pm 0.21 $ ] ( shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ) .",
    "this studies also clearly establish a high metallicity dispersion of the order of 1 dex .",
    "since the early work by baade & swope ( 1961 ) , the sfh of draco has been the subject of much discussion .",
    "the position and morphology of its rgb would indicate a very old age for the main population , similar to that of the globular clusters ( grillmair _ et al .",
    "but the predominantly red hb seems to be incompatible with this , at least if age is the second parameter ( although recent results indicate that this assumption might be inadequate : rosenberg _ et al .  _ 1999 ; behr _ et al .  _",
    "in such a case , draco should be some 2 gyr younger than both the globular clusters and the ursa minor dsph galaxy ( stetson _ et al .  _ 1985 ; carney & seitzer 1986 ) . on another hand , carney & seitzer ( 1986 ) found some evidence of a younger , @xmath21 gyr - old population and , if the blue plume is produced by younger ms stars rather than by blue stragglers , in favor of the hypothesis that the star formation in draco should be extended up to a few gyr ago , even if at a low rate ( carney & seitzer 1986 ; grillmair _ et al .",
    "this would also be compatible with the presence of the aforementioned anomalous cepheids , which would belong to a few gyr - old population ( norris & zinn 1975 ; demarque & hirshfeld 1975 ; see also gallart _ et al .",
    "_ 1999a and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of the star formation history , metallicity , and morphological properties of draco , based on wide - field , ground - based photometry .",
    "we confirm previous results favoring a predominantly old stellar population and show evidence of a relatively short star formation burst 23 gyr ago .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , the observations and the data reduction are presented . in  3 , the cmd of draco is presented and the metallicity and distance obtained . in  4 ,",
    "the morphological properties of draco are discussed , including its overall structure , surface luminosity distribution and three - dimensional orientation . in ",
    "5 , the star formation history is computed using two different methods .",
    "finally , the main results of the paper are summarized in  6 .",
    "images of draco were obtained in @xmath22 and @xmath23 johnson  cousins filters during several observing runs with the int ( 2.5 m ) at roque de los muchachos observatory on the island of la palma ( canary islands , spain ) .",
    "table [ journal ] gives the journal of observations .",
    "the wfc was used with four @xmath24 eev chips .",
    "the scale is 0.33 @xmath25/pix which provides a total field of about @xmath26 arcmin@xmath27 .",
    "several fields were sampled , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ima_1 ] .",
    "figure [ ima_2 ] displays an isopleth map of draco , by irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) , showing also the area covered by our observations .",
    "total integration times were 1920 s in @xmath22 and 1600 s in @xmath23 for field a ( the central field ) ; 3600 s in @xmath22 and 4200 s in @xmath23 for field b , and 2820 s both in @xmath22 and @xmath23 for field c.    bias and flat - field corrections were made with iraf . then , daophot and allframe ( stetson 1994 ) were used to obtain the instrumental photometry of the resolved stars .",
    "transformation into the standard photometric system requires several observations of standard star fields in such a way that standards are measured in all four chips . in practice",
    ", we observed three fields in the four chips and used them to calculate relative photometric transformations from each chip to the central one ( chip 4 ) .",
    "then , a larger number of standard star fields were measured in chip 4 during the observing run to calculate both nightly atmospheric extinctions and the general transformation into the standard johnson  cousins system . in total ,",
    "280 measurements of 30 standards were made during the observing run of june 1999 .",
    "summarizing , the transformations from each chip to chip 4 are :    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    and @xmath33    where subindices refer to chips , lower - case letters stand for instrumental magnitudes , and capital letters for johnson  cousins magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath34 values are the dispersions of the fits at the centers of mass of the point distributions ; hence they are the minimum internal zero - point errors .",
    "there is a large zero point ( bigger than 0.4 mag in most cases ) displacement between chip 4 and the other chips , which implies the lower sensitivity of the former .",
    "transformations from chip 4 instrumental magnitudes measured at the top of the atmosphere into johnson - cousins magnitudes are given by :    @xmath35    and @xmath36    where , as before , lower - case letters refer to instrumental magnitudes and capital letters to johnson  cousins magnitudes .",
    "finally , dispersions of the extinctions for each night are about @xmath37 for both filters .",
    "this provides the photometric transformation for the 1999 observing run . for the remaining runs ,",
    "transformations were done using as secondary standards the stars of the draco fields overlapping with those of the 1999 run . in this way ,",
    "the consistency of the photometric scales of the different fields is secured .",
    "aperture corrections are necessary to transform the allframe magnitudes into large - radius aperture magnitudes .",
    "the latter is the system in which the magnitudes of standard stars have been measured .",
    "the transformation has been performed through aperture photometry on a set of @xmath38 isolated bright stars of field a after subtracting the remaining stars from the frames .",
    "the difference between these and the allframe magnitudes for the same stars provides the aperture correction for the corresponding frame .",
    "dispersions in the aperture corrections are of the order of 0.01 . putting all the errors together , the total zero - point error of our photometry can be estimated to be about @xmath39 for both bands , although it is up to @xmath40 for chip 3 in filter @xmath23 .    for each star",
    ", allframe provides with the dispersion in the psf fitting . in general , these dispersions do not reproduce the external errors of the photometry , which stem mainly from stellar crowding and blending ( see aparicio , & gallart 1995 and gallart , aparicio , & vlchez 1996 ) , but they provide an indication of the internal accuracy of the photometry . in this sense ,",
    "our average allstar errors are 0.02 , 0.06 , and 0.15 for @xmath41 , 22.8 , and 23.9 , respectively , and for @xmath42 , 23.9 , and 25.0 , respectively .",
    "artificial - star tests were performed on field a in the usual way ( stetson & harris 1988 ; see also aparicio & gallart 1995 ) to check the observational effects and estimate completeness factors as a function of magnitude .",
    "in practice , 20  000 artificial stars were added to the @xmath22 and @xmath23 images of draco .",
    "coordinates of these stars were distributed in a grid covering the whole image .",
    "the step used to build this net was @xmath43 both in @xmath44 and @xmath45 , avoiding overcrowding effects .",
    "colors and magnitudes of artificial stars were obtained from the synthetic cmd ( computed as described in aparicio & gallart 1995 ) of an old stellar population . in this way",
    ", they approximately mimic the real cmd of draco , which is important for a realistic observational effect test .",
    "the resulting completeness factors are shown in figure [ crow ] .",
    "they start to drop at @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 ; see  3.1 ) . but about 5% of the stars are lost at any magnitude brighter than @xmath46 .",
    "these are mostly stars lying in the regions around very bright , saturated , field stars .",
    "figure [ cmd ] shows the cmd of draco .",
    "stars within the inner @xmath48 ( the semi - major axis ) have been plotted ( see below ) .",
    "a pseudo-@xmath49 magnitude , obtained as @xmath47 , is used in the vertical axis .",
    "this has the advantage of producing an almost horizontal hb .",
    "it shows a well populated , narrow red giant branch ( rgb ) with a relatively small slope as well as a blueward extended hb .",
    "these features are the trace of an old , low - metallicity stellar population with a small metallicity dispersion .",
    "the main sequence ( ms ) is visible at @xmath50 and , very interestingly , an extended sequence of blue stars with @xmath51 , @xmath52 is also present .",
    "this could be a blue - straggler ( bs ) sequence or the signature of a younger stellar population .",
    "figure [ cmd_eli ] shows cmds for elliptical annuli of increasing semi - major axis .",
    "note firstly that traces of draco rgb and ms are still evident at @xmath53 . also noticeable is the small group of stars above the red part of the horizontal branch , visible in the cmd for @xmath54 at @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "this can be a red clump formed by stars burning he in their nuclei and would be the signature of a young - to - intermediate population .",
    "in fact , baade & swope ( 1961 ) and zinn & searle ( 1976 ) found anomalous cepheids in this region .",
    "an explanation for the origin of these variables is indeed that they are young - to - intermediate age stars .",
    "if so , they should have an ms counterpart , perhaps like the blue extension discussed above .",
    "we will come again to this point in section 4 .",
    "these cmds will be used later on as a reference for discussion of galactocentric gradients of stellar populations and metallicity .",
    "the metallicity of draco has been investigated by carney & seitzer ( 1986 ) , who obtained [ fe / h ] @xmath57 from the color of the rgb . from the spectroscopy of three giant stars , shetrone _ et al .  _",

    "the color of the rgb is frequently used to obtain an alternative estimate of the metallicity .",
    "recently , gallart et al . (",
    "2001 ) have shown that these values can be wrong .",
    "however we have applied the method to our data and derived an estimate of the metallicity in the understanding that it will be useful for comparison with results for other galaxies existing in the literature .    to do so",
    ", we have used the relations provided by saviane _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2000 ) , based on the position of the rgb of several globular clusters . however , these relations are calculated in the @xmath59 $ ] plane while our photometry is @xmath60 .",
    "hence the saviane _",

    "we have used the padua ( bertelli _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) and yale ( yi , demarque , & oemler 1997 ) isochrones to obtain , for a set of metallicities , the values of the absolute @xmath62 magnitude and the color indices corresponding to the rgb at @xmath63 . we denote these values by @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . in this way , we obtain the curve in the [ @xmath67 plane shown by a thick line in figure [ cur_met ] . besides @xmath64 and @xmath66 , the parameter changing along this curve is @xmath65 .",
    "the intersection of the rgb fiducial line of draco with the curve gives its @xmath65 , whose value is 1.18 .",

    "besides this , we have directly obtained an alternative calibration for the metallicity in the @xmath61 $ ] plane . for this purpose",
    ", we have used the rgbs of three globular clusters : ngc 1904 ( alcaino _ et al .",

    "@xmath73 and the metallicity obtained therefrom can be used to test whether galactocentric metallicity gradients exist in draco .",
    "cmds for elliptical annuli of increasing semi - major axis , similar to those shown in fig .",

    "third - degree polynomial fits to points in the interval @xmath80 were used to obtain a fiducial rgb for each cmd .",

    "the error bars show the internal dispersions of points about the polynomial fits",
    ". inspection of this figure reveals that no metallicity gradient can be deduced to exist in draco .",
    "a metallicity dispersion of about 1 dex in [ fe / h ] has been clearly established in studies referred to the inner @xmath81 of draco ( stetson 1984 ; shetrone , bolte , & stetson 1998 ; lehnert _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ) .",

    "it is difficult to obtain the surface brightness distribution of galaxies which , like draco , have a very low stellar density and which are resolved down to stars of quite faint intrinsic luminosity .",
    "an indirect technique is to obtain the surface density distribution of resolved stars , which is afterwards transformed into a surface - brightness scale . in our case , this transformation has been done as follows .",

    "to do this , stars in box 14 ( see figure [ cmd_box ] ) have been considered . finally , comparison of this number with the total luminosity in @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the synthetic model provides a scale transformation from rgb star counts to magnitudes .",
    "the accuracy of the final scale of magnitudes can not be expected to be high . in particular , it depends on the assumed imf .",
    "but it is probably better than that obtained through direct measurement of brightness on a big field dominated by background noise and contamination by bright foreground stars .    applying this method",
    ", we estimate the central surface brightness in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath113 to be @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where the quoted errors should account for the high degree of uncertainty .",
    "irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) obtained @xmath117 , which is one magnitude fainter than ours .",
    "it is difficult to say which value is preferable .",
    "irwin & hatzidimitriou have obtained theirs from a king model fit to photographic data .",
    "our ccd photometry is deeper and is expected to be more accurate , but , as previously quoted , our estimate could be affected by a wrong choice of the imf and , in general , by the fact that we are using a stellar population model . in our opinion , the relatively large disagreement between both values reveals nothing but the difficulty of obtaining accurate surface photometry of this kind of systems .",
    "the integrated magnitudes of draco can be obtained by integration of the density profile and the central surface brightness abovely obtained .",
    "the results , together with all the morphological parameters obtained here and several other integrated quantities are summarized in table [ densi_par ] . in table",

    "the spatial distribution of stellar populations of different ages gives information on the time - scale in which stars mix out in the galaxy and on kinematic and/or morphological evolution .",
    "computing the detailed models required to perform an accurate analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "but valuable information can be obtained from the comparison of the radial distribution scale lengths of populations of different ages .",
    "the latter can be selected from the boxes defined in fig .",
    "[ cmd_box ] , since different boxes sample different ages ( see details in  5 ) .    from synthetic models computed for the sfh study ( see below , ",
    "5 ) it can be seen that boxes 12 and 14 ( fig .",
    "[ cmd_box ] ) contain stars with ages in the interval 915 gyr , while boxes 2 to 6 , 10 and 13 contain younger stars and preferently , stars in the interval 23 gyr ( they sample the small recent starburst ; see  5 ) .",
    "we have calculated the radial distribution scale length for both groups of stars in the region @xmath118 .",
    "we have obtained @xmath119 for the older population and @xmath120 for the younger ; _ i.e. , _ there is no significant difference either between both or with respect to the whole resolved stellar population . within the errors , this indicates that stars of different ages where formed with similar spatial distribution or that their movement in the galaxy has completely mixed them .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies usually present high mass - to - luminosity ratios ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "draco , in particular , has @xmath121 ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "dark matter is usually invoked as an explanation for these large values in a virialized scenario .",
    "an alternative explanation has been proposed by kroupa ( 1997 ) and klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) , who suggest that tidal disruption of these galaxies by the milky way potential would well produce very elongated systems whose main axis , together with the main axis of the velocity ellipsoid , could eventually be oriented close to the line of sight .",
    "in such a case , the high observed velocity dispersion would not need of large quantities of dark matter to be accounted for .    to check this possibility",
    "we have adopted the hypothesis that draco is configured according to model rs1 - 4 of kroupa ( 1997 ) , which is the one that most closely reproduces the @xmath14 of draco .",
    "the spatial distribution of stars in this model is shown in figure [ kroupa ] .",
    "we have then simulated the predicted distance dispersion of draco stars to us in a synthetic cmd of a stellar population similar to that found for draco ( see  4 ) .",
    "the cmds before and after simulating the distance dispersion are shown in figure [ disper ] .",
    "comparison of the right - hand cmd with the draco cmd ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) clearly indicates the incompatibility of the rs1 - 4 model with the observations .    on another hand ,",
    "the extension of draco along the line of sight can be estimated from the width of the hb .",
    "this width is potentially affected by several factors , such as observational effects , stellar evolution or binarity of composite stellar populations . from our artificial - star test (  2 )",
    "we have checked that widening of the hb by observational effects can be neglected , but considering every other possible effect in detail is complicated .",
    "however , an upper limit estimate can still be set by neglecting all the effects and assuming that the entire width observed in the red hb ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) is produced by distance dispersion .",
    "in such a case , the size of draco along the line of sight would be @xmath9 kpc .",
    "this is quite a large value compared with draco s size in the plane of sky but it should be stressed that it is an upper limit , and that it is still less than 1/3 the size given by the rs1 - 4 model .",
    "the sfh of a galaxy can be derived in detail from a deep cmd through comparison with synthetic cmds ( aparicio 2001 ) .",
    "details on the computation of synthetic cmds and on the method used here to derive the sfh can be found in gallart _ et al .  _",
    "( 1999b ) , aparicio & gallart ( 1995 ) , and references therein .",
    "the accuracy and temporal resolution of the sfh depend on the quality and depth of the observed cmd and on the uncertainties in the stellar evolutionary library upon which the synthetic cmds are computed . to obtain a reasonable resolution for old ages the cmd must sample stellar evolutionary phases sensitive to these ages , such as the hb or the lower ms . moreover , the rc , the rgb , and the hb itself provide information on the chemical enrichment law ( cel ) .",
    "the cel and the initial mass function ( imf ) , together with the star formation rate ( sfr ) , are the functions contained in the more general sfh",
    ". a function containing information on the fraction and mass distribution of binary stars would also be relevant . for simplicity ,",
    "we have neglected here the influence of binary stars and have assumed a fixed imf : that given by kroupa , tout , & gilmore ( 1993 )",
    ". the cel can be constrained by the morphology and color of the rgb . as discussed above ( see  3.2 )",
    "draco presents a low average metallicity and a low metallicity dispersion , [ fe / h ] @xmath122 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath123 .",
    "however , the padua stellar evolutionary models produce a best fit to draco rgb for @xmath124 .",
    "this difference is due to the internal tuning of the stellar evolution models and is not important for the analysis of the metallicity .",
    "however , it is preferable using it to compute the synthetic cmds necessary for the sfh study . in practice , we have assumed a cel independent of time producing metallicity values for the stars randomly distributed in the interval @xmath125 for all ages .",
    "provided that the stellar population does not have a large amount of young stars ( younger than some 1 gyr ) , as can be deduced from the extension of the ms of draco , this cel produces synthetic cmds with an rgb always compatible with that of draco .",
    "the only remaining function to complete the sfh of draco is the sfr .",
    "two different methods have been used to obtain it .",
    "the first method is that of the iac - padua group ( see aparicio 1998 for a description and gallart _ et al .  _",
    "1999b for one of the latest applications ) , which we will refer to as the _ partial diagram _ or _ partial model _ method .",
    "the second method is that presented by mighell ( 1997 ) , which we will refer to as the _ subgiant _ method .",
    "we will discuss in turn the results obtained with each of these .",
    "this method was introduced by aparicio , gallart , & bertelli ( 1997 ) . to apply it , a few synthetic cmds ( partial models )",
    "are computed , each for a stellar population with ages in a narrow interval ( typically , a few partial models are used each embracing an age interval ranging from several @xmath126 yr to a few gyr to cover the full @xmath127 gyr of galaxy ages ) . the padua stellar evolution library ( bertelli _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) is used for this purpose .",
    "the basic idea is that any sfr can be simulated as a linear combination of partial models .",
    "the practical way to derive the sfr is as follows .",
    "a number of boxes are defined in the cmds ( observed and partial models ) and the number of stars are counted inside them .",
    "the boxes are defined in such a way they sample stellar evolutionary phases providing information about different ages .",
    "let us call @xmath128 the number of stars in box @xmath129 in the observed cmd and @xmath130 the number of stars in box @xmath129 of partial model @xmath131 ( the partial model covering the @xmath131th age interval ) .",
    "using this , the distribution of stars in boxes of an arbitrary sfr can be obtained from a linear combination of the @xmath130 , by @xmath132 the corresponding sfr can be written as @xmath133 where @xmath134 are the linear combination coefficients , @xmath135 is a scaling constant , and @xmath136 if @xmath137 is inside the interval corresponding to partial model @xmath131 , and @xmath138 otherwise . finally , the @xmath139 having the best compatibility with the data can be obtained by a least - squares fitting of @xmath140 to @xmath128 , the @xmath134 coefficients being the free parameters .",
    "the finite time interval of partial models introduces a limitation on the time resolution of the sfh .",
    "but it must be noted that the final limitation is indeed imposed by the accuracy of observations and the precision of stellar evolutionary models and also that increasing the time resolution of the computed solution is only a matter of computer time .",
    "ten partial models have been considered for the analysis of draco sfh , covering the age interval from 15 to 2 gyr .",
    "the latter has been assumed the youngest age present in the cmd because it is the age of the isochrone having the turn - off point at @xmath141 , corresponding to the upper point of the draco blue plume . on the other hand ,",
    "16 boxes have been defined in the cmd , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cmd_box ] , to characterize the distribution of stars .",
    "boxes 1 to 6 sample the younger population , living in the upper ms .",
    "the consequences of this assumption are discussed below . in this analysis",
    "we will assume that all these stars are ms stars and not bs .",
    "boxes 7 to 10 sample the subgiant ( sg ) region .",
    "the information provided by these stars is complementary to the former one .",
    "fainter stars are not considered because they are affected by bigger observational effects .",
    "in fact , this will limit the time resolution for the oldest stellar ages . boxes 11 and 12 sample the hb .",
    "these boxes sample the old stellar population .",
    "in particular , if age is the second parameter , box 11 would contain the oldest pure population . here",
    ", we will assume that this is the case , but it must be kept in mind that the nature of the second parameter is not fully confirmed and that the blueward extension of the hb depends on stellar evolution parameters that are not well controlled . the color uncertainty produced by this is the reason why we define boxes 11 and 12 to be quite extended in color .",
    "box 13 samples intermediate - age to young stars in the core he - burning phase .",
    "they should have a counterpart in the blue plume and the upper sg region .",
    "region 14 samples the rgb , populated by old and intermediate - age stars born in fact in the full , 215 gyr interval considered here , as well as some agbs in the same age interval .",
    "although it provides nothing in terms of age resolution when compared with the information contained in other boxes , the number of stars in box 14 is a strong tool to normalize the full sfr : independently of the age distribution , the integrated sfr for the old and intermediate - age stars must be compatible with the number of stars populating box 14 .",
    "box 15 samples intermediate - age agbs .",
    "it should have a counterpart in the blue plume and the sg region .",
    "finally , box 16 sample young agbs .",
    "the fact that it contain no stars indicates that the sfr in the last several million years has been zero or negligible .",
    "linear combinations of partial models predicting stars in this region will be automatically rejected .",
    "we have so far commented qualitatively on the different age intervals sampled by each box defined in the cmd .",
    "however , the solution for the sfr is found in a global way , considering the number of stars in all the boxes . in practice , it is not reasonable to look for the best solution ( the linear coefficients best reproducing the distribution of stars in the boxes of the observational cmd ) , but to search all the solutions providing a stellar distribution compatible with the observed one within some interval . here , we have adopted as good solutions all those producing a number of stars in each box within @xmath142 from the observed value , @xmath34 for each box being the maximum between @xmath143 and 1 .",
    "the reason for adopting a minimum value of 1 for @xmath34 is to dump small - number effects on the solution .",
    "the resulting sfr is shown in figure [ sfr_pm ] .",
    "error bars represent the sigma value of all the linear combinations producing good solutions for each age interval .",
    "the most relevant fact of the solution is that the dominant population is old ( older than 10 gyr ) .",
    "it is also remarkable that the sfr extends down to a few gyr - old stars , including a jump between 2 and 3 gyr .",
    "the later depends on the assumption we have made that the blue plume is made up of normal ms stars .",
    "if this is wrong , the sfr of intermediate - age to young stars would be lower than the values obtained .",
    "however , the intermediate - age star formation activity is also supported by the presence of subgiants and core he - burning stars in the cmd .",
    "this solution can not be however considered as completely deterministic .",
    "in fact , error bars are in general comparable to the values of @xmath139 for ages between 3 and 10 gyr .",
    "this , however , does not mean that we know very little about the solution , but that we can not determine with a high degree of confidence whether the most conspicuous population is 1213.5 or 13.515 gyr old , for example , or whether the jump at 23 gyr is as strong as it appears in fig .",
    "[ sfr_pm ] or is more ( or less ) diluted in time .    summarizing",
    ", the fact that the dominant population in draco is old may be considered as a well established result of the present analysis . also , under the assumption that the stars populating boxes 1 to 6 ( fig .",
    "[ cmd_box ] ) are ms stars rather than blue stragglers , a low rate , intermediate - age stellar population exist . the jump at 23 gyr is compatible with an overpopulation of stars in box 4 but mainly comes from the stars populating box 13 .",
    "these stars can well be @xmath13 1.21.5 @xmath144 in the phase of core he burning .",
    "the sfr obtained here has been used to calculate the total mass in stars and stellar remnants ( @xmath145 ) for the inner @xmath146 and @xmath48 ( semi - major axis ) .",
    "for this , it has been assumed that a fraction 0.8 of the integral of the sfr remains locked into stars or stellar remnants .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath48 can be considered as a good estimate of the total real value , since the fraction of stars at distances larger than @xmath48 is negligible ( see fig .",
    "[ densi_p ] ) .",
    "both values are quoted in table [ densi_par ] and the second is used to calculate the dark matter fraction , @xmath147 .",
    "the turn - off is the most sensitive indicator of stellar age for single stellar populations .",
    "however , in systems such as galaxies , where the stellar population is composite , the turn - offs of successive stellar generations mix with each other and with the main sequence of younger stars . in such cases ,",
    "the subgiant ( sg ) region is preferable for measuring stellar ages .",
    "it also has the advantage of being , for a given age and metallicity , above the corresponding turn - off point , thereby allowing a better signal to noise in the magnitudes .",
    "mighell ( 1997 ) introduced a simple method based on star counts in the sg region to determine the sfr . for this purpose , the sg region",
    "is divided with isochrones of a given metallicity and increasing ages .",
    "then the number of stars are counted between each two isochrones , which provides a present - day age distribution .",
    "normalized by the stellar lifetime in the sg region as a function of age , this distribution results in the sfr . in the present case ,",
    "we perform this normalization dividing the observed , present - day age distribution by the distribution corresponding to a synthetic cmd computed for a constant sfr and the metallicity adopted for draco .    resolution is worse for older ages , due both to the increasing photometry errors and to the decreasing width of the magnitude interval between isochrones .",
    "the method provides a good time resolution up to @xmath21 gyr .    a severe limitation of the method , as it is presently applied ,",
    "is that it allows only a constant metallicity for the stellar population .",
    "this , however , is not very important for very low metallicity galaxies such as draco . also , as a matter of fact , this method uses only a part of the information that is used by the partial model method , for which the solution should be considered less accurate and conclusive .",
    "however , in the present case , in which metallicity evolution is not tested , the subgiant method provides an alternative approach in which the solution rest only on the sg stars .    in the present analysis , and for the same reasons",
    "as given in  4.1 , the adopted metallicity was @xmath148 , with an he abundance of @xmath149 . with this input and the kroupa _",
    "et al .  _",

    "observational effects have been simulated as explained in aparicio & gallart ( 1995 ) .",
    "this is important because errors and completeness significantly change along the sg region .",
    "the simulation has been done six times with different random number seeds .",
    "this allows calculating a dispersion for the synthetic star counts in each age interval .",

    "the resulting sfr is presented in fig .",
    "[ sfr_sg ] , which , together with a dominant old population , shows an intermediate - age population as far as 2 gyr ago . to estimate the errors two components have been considered .",
    "the first is just the square root of the star counts for each age interval .",
    "it would account for the fact that we work with a limited number of stars .",
    "the second is the dispersion found for the synthetic star counts and would account for the random fluctuations in the observational effect simulation .",
    "the most interesting thing is that both the partial model and the subgiant methods produce qualitatively similar results , including the young bump which , although less clear , is also visible in fig .",
    "[ sfr_sg ] , slightly shifted to older ages .",
    "this stress the stability of the solution and reinforces the capability of both methods to obtain the sfh of nearby galaxies .",
    "the main difference is that the sfr derived by the subgiant method is more softly decreasing and it maintains a higher value at intermediate ages .",
    "this could be due to observational effects that would spread the stars in the subgiant region , the overall result being that fainter stars are moved upwards . in any case , the fact that the partial model method uses more information from the cmd eventually makes preferable the result obtained with it .",
    "we have presented a photometric and morphological analysis of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy , as well as a study of its stellar content and star formation history based on wide field photometry covering about @xmath150 .",
    "two methods ( _ partial model _ and _ subgiant _ ) have been used to investigate the sfh of draco .",
    "the most important result is that the stellar population is fundamentally old ( older than @xmath10 gyr ) .",

    "after that , the star formation continued at a low rate and , apparently , a small burst was produced some 23 gyr ago .",
    "no star formation activity is detected in the analysis of the cmd for more recent epochs .",
    "the star surface density distribution of draco can be fitted by a single exponential law of scale - length @xmath3 , for galacto - centric distances larger than @xmath152 . within errors ,",
    "the same scale is found for the old ( older than @xmath153 gyr ) and the young ( @xmath113 gyr ) stars , indicating either that both populations were formed under the same kinematic conditions or that any initial difference was afterwards erased .",
    "evidences have been found of the galaxy extending as far as @xmath154 ( 1 kpc ) from its center .",
