    "models of structure formation and galaxy evolution have reached a state where the impact of large - scale baryonic feedback on galaxy evolution can no longer be neglected . however , the physics of such processes are complex , and as yet not very well understood , especially at high redshift , where the most massive galaxies formed most of their stars .",
    "therefore , simulations of the ensemble of galaxies typically incorporate these processes , which originate on scales beyond the resolution of typical large scale simulations , as simple relationships and parameterizations , which are in turn tuned to approximately match observed galaxy properties . in spite of these limitations ,",

    "previous rest - frame uv spectroscopy of mrc1138 - 262 did not reveal nuclear broad lines , indicating that mrc1138 - 262 might harbor an obscured quasar , similar to mrc2025 - 218 @xcite .",

    ", we fit and remove the nuclear spectrum from all other spatial pixels .",
    "this may lead to a slight oversubtraction of extended line emission along the line of sight of the agn . in our later analysis , we aim at setting lower limits to the emission line kinematics and fluxes , therefore this procedure is nonetheless appropriate . in the k - band , we can use the luminous broad h@xmath5 emission line as an indicator for how well our algorithm removes the agn light .",

    "using the iraf task splot , we fitted [ oiii]5007 line emission with up to 3 kinematic components , requiring @xmath35 in each component . systematic errors of these measurements are possibly large , and the agn removal in the h band might be not very precise .",

    "velocities in zone  1 decline with increasing projected distance from the nucleus , gradually approaching the values in zone  2 at the eastern bound .",
    "this is in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : velvsdistplot ] , which also suggests that the velocities in zone 1 at its low - velocity end approach the velocities in zone 2 .",

    "however , we are using the term `` bubble '' somewhat loosely , referring mainly to the clearly distinct zones in velocity space .",
    "their morphologies are nearly circular as if projected on the sky , and are consistent with expanding spheres or projected conical outflows",
    ". they might be analogues of buoyantly rising , low - density regions in low - redshift radio galaxies , but our analysis does not rely on this interpretation . by using this term , we simply relate to the geometry and velocity structure of the gas , not necessarily the full astrophysical interpretation .",

    "our data indicate that the gas reaches large distances , over 25 kpc for the high surface brightness emission , and might even completely escape the host potential . a way of estimating the time scale of the flow is to calculate the crossing time given the observed velocities .",
