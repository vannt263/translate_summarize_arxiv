    "<S> the efficient market hypothesis ( emh ) based on rational expectation assumption considers the price of financial markets a random walk , thus the variety of price is unpredictable . in the recent years , the emh suffers the impugnation on rational expectation assumption and the challenge of actual financial data@xcite , and some financial markets models are established , including behavior - mind model@xcite , dynamic - games model@xcite , multi - agent model@xcite , and so on .    </S>",

    "<S> the stockholder s decision includes two steps : first , each stockholder works out a preparatory decision according to the history of its investment and the stock price . </S>",
    "<S> the stockholders of different risk - properties have different decision methods . </S>",
    "<S> the risk - neutral individuals directly inherit the last decision . </S>",
    "<S> the risk - aversed individuals investing strategy is to buy at a low price and to sell at a high price . </S>",

    "<S> if an individual chose to buy or to sell , she should determine the price and amount of the trading - application . </S>",
    "<S> the buying - price and selling - price will be chosen completely randomly in the interval @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the trading - amount is proportional to the quantity of capital owned by swapper . </S>",
    "<S> after that , each stockholder starts to investigate its neighbors and change its decision ( even its risk - property ) at a certain probability . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the next risk - property and the final decision of an individual is obtained by choosing neighboring individual to carry on genetic operation . considering that stockholders are always inclined to listen to the winners , the individual beneficial coefficient @xmath15 is set as the ratio of current capitalization to initial capitalization . </S>",

    "<S> the central individual will select one to run the crossover operation at the probability , between whom and the individual s fitness there s a direct proportion . </S>",
    "<S> the risk - property and the decision of each individual are naturally divided into four types of genes logically , including risk - property , deal - decision , price - decision and amount - decision . in this paper , the four genes crossing over operation is independent from each other . </S>",
    "<S> the offspring draws its final decision or changes its risk - property by selecting the genes of the central individual at the probability of @xmath18 , and of the neighboring individual at the probability of @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> the buyer with higher price and the seller with lower price will trade preferentially , and the trading - price is the average of seller s and buyer s price . the stock price is the weighted average of trading - price according to the trading - amount .    </S>",

    "<S> it has been reported that the central part of the distribution of s&p500 returns appears to be well fitted by a @xmath0 distribution , but the asymptotic behavior of the distribution shows faster decay than that predicted by a @xmath0 distribution@xcite . </S>",
