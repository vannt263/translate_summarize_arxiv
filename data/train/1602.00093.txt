    "since the pioneering work by may  @xcite , the concept of nestedness indicating the systematically included structure composed of generalists and specialists has been assumed to be one of the most characteristic structures of ecological networks  @xcite .",
    "these obviously evolved , not designed , systems must have reasons to be formed as such , and the candidates for the reasons include dynamical stability  @xcite and biodiversity  @xcite .",
    "once such a structural property is expressed as a purely mathematical form , it is possible to study the network systems in general without involving the intrinsic properties of ecosystems .",
    "indeed , compared to when the concept was first conceived , such networked systems in general have been widely investigated since the turn of the century and so on  @xcite , which naturally enables us to connect the nestedness to possibly more network properties in more general contexts .",
    "for instance , the concept has been used to describe economic systems  @xcite such as industrial ecosystems  @xcite as well .    in such a general setting ,",
    "nestedness is one of the examples of the _ mesoscale _ structure of networks .",
    "the term mesoscale means somewhere between the microscale structure such as the degree ( the number of neighbors a node has ) and the macroscopic structure such as the average edge density ( the ratio of the number of existing edges to the number of node pairs ) . in this paper",
    "we suggest that another mesoscale structure , called the core - periphery structure of networks  @xcite , is closely related to nestedness . to be more specific ,",
    "the gradual change from generalists to specialists corresponds to the gradual change in the _ coreness _ of the nodes , which makes the nested structure a generalized version of a clear - cut core versus periphery structure .",
    "in fact , the connection between the two concepts may seem to be too obvious from the adjacency matrix form ( shape for the nested and shape for the core - periphery structure ) to report , but we also find that it reveals a more fundamental property of real networks constrained by the degree distribution , which is widely used as the keystone of network ensembles .    to systematically investigate the relation between the two concepts , we first define the measures of nestedness and core - periphery - ness ( likeness to the core - periphery structure ) in the weighted and bipartite network level in sec .",
    "[ sec : nestedness_and_c_p ] .",
    "the mutualistic ecological networks and synthetic network model used in our study are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : mutualistic_networks ] . using the measures and data introduced , we present the result in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] with a summary and discussion .",
    "we use the basic nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill ( nodf )  @xcite , denoted by @xmath0 in this paper for simplicity , although we note that there are other measures  @xcite .",
    "the nodf counts the number of pairs of rows satisfying the nested structure for each column pair and the number of columns satisfying the nested structure for each row pair , after sorting the rows and columns in descending order of degree , or strength ( the sum of weights on the edges attached to the node ) in the case of weighted networks  @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is the weighted adjacency matrix  @xcite representing the network ( @xmath2 represents the interaction between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , while @xmath5 represents the absence of interaction between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , where both sets of indices are sorted by the descending order of nodes strength .",
    "mathematically , @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] are the fraction of pairs of columns satisfying the nested inclusion structure for the row pair index @xmath9 and the fraction of pairs of rows satisfying the nested inclusion structure for the column pair index @xmath10 , respectively , for the adjacency matrix @xmath1 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the numbers of rows and columns , respectively , which are used in the denominator for the proper normalization condition @xmath13 $ ] . as a result , @xmath0 captures the maximally nested case ( @xmath14 ) and the minimally nested case ( @xmath15 ) . for details with illustrations ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    note that we generalize the inclusion criterion introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to include the weighted networks , as many of our mutualistic networks ( introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : data_sets ] ) are weighted .",
    "the generalization is straightforwardly achieved by using the unviolated - case criterion that contributes to @xmath16 : @xmath17 for @xmath18 ( the strength of @xmath4 is greater than or equal to the strength of @xmath19 ) instead of the unweighted version that @xmath20 should be @xmath21 if @xmath22 is @xmath21 for @xmath18 .",
    "the unviolated case contributing to @xmath23 is similar : @xmath24 for @xmath25 ( the strength of @xmath3 is greater than or equal to the strength of @xmath26 ) instead of the unweighted version that @xmath20 should be @xmath21 if @xmath22 is @xmath21 for @xmath25 . in the case of unweighted networks",
    "where @xmath27 , our criterion is just the same as the conventional one for the unweighted version in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is used for our synthetic networks ( introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : synthetic_network_model ] ) .      one may argue that the nestedness and core - periphery structure are different in spirit , as the former describes the overall organization of a network and the latter focuses on the separation of core and periphery .",
    "however , as illustrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the latter also concerns the overall structures by assigning the _ gradual _ core scores for nodes ( and edges as well ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) . as we demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the nested structures of adjacency matrices are in fact such a gradual change of coreness .",
    "of course , one can always define certain objective functions analogous to the community identification  @xcite to actually find the core - periphery separation , e.g. , as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method to calculate the edge - density - based coreness , called a core score ( cs ) , is the modified version of the one introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite to fully consider the bipartivity of ecological mutualistic networks .",
    "there are other ways to quantify the coreness such as backup - path - based one in refs .",
    "@xcite , but we use cs in this analysis because there is a natural way to quantify the overall core - periphery structure in the formalism of cs . again , suppose @xmath1 is the weighted adjacency matrix representing the mutualistic network , in particular , among a given set of animals @xmath28 and plants @xmath29 .",
    "the network has @xmath30 nodes in total , and the value @xmath20 indicates the weight of the connection between the animal node @xmath31 and the plant node @xmath32 .",
    "we insert the core - matrix elements @xmath33 into the core quality @xmath34 where the components of the parameter vector @xmath35 $ ] determines the sharpness of the core - periphery division and @xmath36 $ ] determines the fraction of core nodes for animals and plants , respectively .",
    "we decompose the core - matrix elements into a product form , @xmath37 , where the elements of the core vector    @xmath38    for each type of node @xmath39 .",
    "references  @xcite also discuss the use of alternative transition functions to the one in eq .",
    "( [ transition_function ] ) .",
    "we wish to determine the core - vector elements in ( [ transition_function ] ) so that the core quality in eq .",
    "( [ core_quality ] ) is maximized .",
    "this yields a cs value denoted by @xmath40 for node @xmath3 of @xmath41 where the normalization factor @xmath42 is determined so that the maximum value of @xmath40 over the entire set of nodes is 1 for each type @xmath43 of node separately as @xmath44 . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we use simulated annealing  @xcite ( with the same cooling schedule as in that paper ) . the core - quality landscape tends to be less sensitive to @xmath45 than it is to @xmath46 ; for computational tractability , we fix the value of @xmath47 and take the same value of @xmath48 and thus consider @xmath49 evenly spaced points in the @xmath50 plane . finally , to define the coreness of an entire network , we define the normalized core quality inspired by refs .",
    "@xcite , denoted by @xmath51 in this paper , as @xmath52 for the animal nodes @xmath31 and the plant nodes @xmath32 , which we use for the coreness measure throughout this paper .",
    "values in eq .   for nodes  @xcite are colored . animals ( pollinators ) and plants",
    "are represented as circles and squares , respectively .",
    "the kamada - kawai graph layout algorithm  @xcite is used . ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     we have focused on the structural properties so far , but we have to consider the dynamical aspect of ecological networks as well .",
    "an aspect of dynamical stability on ecological networks can be assessed by the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix  @xcite .",
    "note that our definition of bipartite adjacency matrix @xmath1 in sec .",
    "[ sec : nestedness_and_c_p ] is a nonsquare matrix in general , so we use the original definition of the adjacency matrix : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 represents the interaction between nodes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , regardless of their identities as animals and plants , i.e. , both @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 , which guarantees the square symmetric matrix and real eigenvalues . to check",
    "if our nestedness and its deeply related coreness measure are related to the dynamical stability , we examine the interrelationship between @xmath0 , @xmath51 , and the edge density and the largest eigenvalue @xmath58 of the adjacency matrix @xmath53 for the mutualistic network data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : largest_eigenvalue ] .",
    "the result indicates that there is no statistically significant relation between our nestedness or coreness measures and the dynamical stability measured by the largest eigenvalue . in other words ,",
    "the structural closeness of nestedness and core - periphery structures exists regardless of the dynamical stability , at least for this data set .",
    "we have explored the seemingly obvious connection between the nestedness and core - periphery structure of networks , despite the fact that it looks obvious solely from the shape of adjacency matrix with proper ordering .",
    "we have shown the actual correlation between the two using a set of ecological mutualistic networks and model networks , by clearly addressing the nestedness and core - periphery - ness in the weighted and bipartite network level .",
    "in addition , in the process of generating null - model networks , we have found that given degree distributions set large restriction on both nestedness and core - periphery - ness , which hinders the investigation on the parameter space .    in any case , it is clear that the nestedness can be considered as a generalized ( or finer ) version of the core - periphery structure based on our observation .",
    "we may even consider other variants such as sorting the nodes with respect to the core - periphery - ness values instead of degree values to calculate the nestedness , e.g. , modification of eq .  , where the nodes are sorted based on @xmath51 in eq .   instead of degree",
    "once we accept that those two concepts are closely related , albeit not equivalent , we can map many problems in regard to nestedness , such as its origin , and effects on the system of interest , to those of the core - periphery structures where we may be able to find answers more easily .",
    "finally , we would like to remark on the work on the nestedness and the community structure  @xcite measured by the modularity function  @xcite , where the authors indeed found some degree of correlation between the two concepts .",
    "however , the correlations reported there are much weaker than the ones we report in this work .",
    "it is worth looking at the mesoscale properties of networks , but we believe that the core - periphery structure is the correct measure to compare , rather than the community structure . the phrase `` two sides of the same coin '' included the title of ref .",
