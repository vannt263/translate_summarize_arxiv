    "building a bridge between qcd and the observed properties of hadrons is one of the key problems in modern science .",
    "the international programme focused on the physics of excited nucleons is close to the heart of this effort .",
    "it addresses the questions : which hadron states and resonances are produced by qcd , and how are they constituted ?",
    "the @xmath10 program therefore stands alongside the search for hybrid and exotic mesons as an integral part of the search for an understanding of qcd .",
    "an example of the theory activity in this area is provided in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is in this context that we consider the @xmath11 , @xmath12 roper resonance , whose discovery was reported in 1964 @xcite . in important respects",
    "the roper appears to be a copy of the proton .",
    "however , its ( breit - wigner ) mass is 50% greater @xcite . this feature has long presented a problem within the context of constituent - quark models formulated in terms of colour - spin potentials , which typically produce the following level ordering @xcite : ground state , @xmath12 with radial quantum number @xmath13 and angular momentum @xmath14 ; first excited state , @xmath15 with @xmath16 ; second excited state , @xmath12 , with @xmath17 ; etc .",
    "the difficulty is that the lightest @xmath18 baryon appears to be the @xmath19 , which is heavier than the roper .",
    "holographic models of qcd , viewed by some as a covariant generalisation of constituent - quark potential models , predict degeneracy of the @xmath17 and @xmath20 states @xcite . whilst it has been observed that constituent - quark models with goldstone - boson exchange potentials can produce the observed level ordering @xcite , such a foundation makes problematic a unified description of baryons and mesons . in order to correct the level ordering problem within the potential model paradigm ,",
    "other ideas have been explored .",
    "the possibility that the roper is simply a hybrid baryon with constituent - gluon content is difficult to support because the lightest such states occur with masses above @xmath21gev @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to consider the presence of explicit constituent-@xmath22 components within baryon bound - states @xcite .",
    "whilst not literally correct , such a picture may be interpreted as suggesting that @xmath23 final - state interactions must play an important role in any understanding of the roper .",
    "this perspective is common to modern coupled - channels treatments of baryon resonances @xcite , and finds support in contemporary numerical simulations of lattice - qcd @xcite and dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) studies @xcite .",
    "given that an understanding of the roper has long eluded practitioners , it is unsurprising that this resonance has been a focus of the @xmath10 programme at jefferson lab ( jlab ) .",
    "experiments at jlab @xcite have enabled an extraction of nucleon - to - roper transition form factors and thereby exposed the first zero - crossing seen in any nucleon form factor or transition amplitude . explaining this new structure",
    "also presents a challenge for theory @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding its history , an understanding of the roper is perhaps now beginning to emerge through a constructive interplay between dynamical coupled - channels models and hadron structure calculations , particularly those symmetry - preserving studies made using the tower of dyson - schwinger equations @xcite .",
    "one indication of this is found in predictions for the masses of the baryons dressed - quark - cores @xcite , which match the bare masses of nucleon resonances determined by the excited baryon analysis center ( ebac ) @xcite with a rms - relative error of 14% and , in particular , agree with ebac s value for the bare - mass of the roper resonance ; viz .",
    "( in gev ) , @xmath24 the dse state is the first excitation of the ground - state nucleon whilst the ebac bare state is the source for three distinct features in the @xmath23-scattering @xmath25 partial wave , which migrate widely from the real - energy axis once meson - nucleon final - state interactions are enabled .",
    "it is notable that the dressed - quark core of the nucleon s parity partner is approximately 400mev heavier than @xmath26 and 1.1gev heavier than the core of the ground - state nucleon , a magnitude commensurate with its origin in dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) @xcite .",

    "it expresses the relative momentum correlation between the dressed - quark and -diquarks within the baryon .",

    "so doing we add materially to a body of work that presents the unified analysis of many properties of meson and baryon ground- and excited - states based on the symmetry - preserving treatment of a single quark - quark interaction ; namely , a vector - vector contact - interaction .",
    "this procedure has already been applied to the spectrum of @xmath30-quark mesons and baryons @xcite , and the electromagnetic properties of @xmath31- and @xmath32-mesons , and their diquark partners @xcite .",
    "these studies provide the foundation for much of that which follows . in sec.[framework ]",
    "we present a brief overview of our framework : both the faddeev equation treatment of the nucleon and roper dressed - quark cores , and the currents which describe the interaction of a photon with a baryon composed from consistently - dressed constituents .",
    "additional material is expressed in appendices and referred to as necessary . in sec.[sec : nucleonelastic ] we describe the parameter - free calculation of nucleon elastic form factors within a dse treatment of the contact interaction .",
    "germane to our presentation are comparisons both with data and computations using qcd - like momentum - dependence for the propagators and vertices . in addition , we use the elastic form factors to predict the ratio of valence - quark distribution functions at @xmath3 .    we begin to describe our results for the roper elastic and nucleon - to - roper transition form factors in sec.[sec : transitionelastic ] .",
    "the description continues in sec.[sec : hamm ] , with a consideration of the impact on all form factors of a dressed - quark anomalous magnetic moment . in sec.[sec : mesoncloud ] we explore the effect of meson - cloud contributions to hadron structure calculations in the context of the @xmath5 helicity amplitudes , which have been analysed using coupled - channels methods @xcite .",

    "is assured and we obtain : a dressed - quark that is described by a momentum - independent mass - function but whose computed interaction with the photon is described by a @xmath77-dependent vertex ; scalar and axial - vector diquark correlations ( constituted from dressed - quarks ) whose bethe - salpeter amplitudes are independent of constituent relative momentum but whose interactions with the photon are described by calculated @xmath77-dependent form factors ; and baryons , whose nontrivial spin - flavour structure is determined from the solution of a faddeev equation , which produces a bound - state comprised from dressed - quarks and -diquarks , described by a momentum - independent faddeev amplitude but whose elastic electromagnetic and transition form factors are @xmath77-dependent .",
    "we found that the electromagnetic interactions of baryons constituted thus from the contact interaction are typically described by hard form factors .",
    "although this was to be expected , it is nevertheless important to compute and record the behaviour because this hardness contrasts markedly with results obtained from the momentum - dependent faddeev amplitudes produced by dressed - quark propagators and diquark bethe - salpeter amplitudes with qcd - like momentum - dependence , and with experiment .",
    "hence the present calculations provide concrete comparisons which support a view that experiment is a sensitive probe of the evolution of the strong interaction s running masses and coupling to infrared momenta , and hence of the long - range behaviour of the @xmath66-function .    in this connection",
    ", our analysis of the proton s elastic form factors suggests that the existence , and location if so , of a zero in the ratio of sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of the dressed - quark mass .",
    "our calculations indicate that a constant mass - function produces a zero at a small value of @xmath77 ; a mass - function that is very soft will not produce a zero ; and a mass - function which resembles that obtained in the best available dse- and lattice - qcd studies , produces a zero at a location that is consistent with extant data . obtaining a clear experimental answer to the question of whether or not there is a zero , and its location in the latter case , is therefore particularly important .",
    "it is worth reiterating that the diquark correlations , whose properties are computed and employed herein , are composite and fully - interacting .",
    "they must not be confused with the pointlike and sometimes inert degrees - of - freedom used in constituent - quark@xmath125constituent - diquark potential models of baryons .",
    "indeed , our analysis showed that the structure and interactions of the diquark correlations play an important role in the development of each baryon form factor .",

    "it is notable in this connection that our treatment of the contact interaction produces a first excitation of the nucleon which is constituted almost entirely ( 81% ) from axial - vector diquark correlations .",
    "this is an intriguing possibility that should be checked using a faddeev equation kernel built from an interaction with qcd - like momentum dependence .",
    "a primary motivation for this study was a desire to correlate nucleon elastic and transition form factors , so that the latter could be considered well - constrained , and then probe further for a connection between the properties of a baryon s dressed - quark core and the bare quantities which feature in modern coupled - channels analyses of resonance electroproduction .",
    "we focussed primarily on the @xmath5 transition and obtained form factors that underestimate extant data on the domain @xmath172gev@xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with having deliberately omitted effects associated with a meson cloud in the faddeev kernel and the current . on the other hand ,",
    "the results are qualitatively in agreement with the trend of available data ; for instance , @xmath6 obtained from the dressed - quark core exhibits a zero at @xmath7 .    in faddeev equation treatments of a baryon s dressed - quark core",
    "it is common to find that anomalous electromagnetic moments are underestimated .",
    "this is apparent herein , in connection , too , with transition form factors .",
    "we therefore explored the effect produced by a dressed - quark anomalous electromagnetic moment , whose existence is an essential consequence of dcsb .",
    "we found that with a realistic value for this dressed - quark moment , the magnitudes of hadron magnetic moments are typically increased by @xmath173% and magnetic radii by @xmath174% , and thereafter agree much better with experiment .",
    "as mentioned above , on the domain @xmath8gev@xmath9 it is widely suspected that the inclusion of effects associated with strong meson - baryon final state interactions ",
    "the so - called meson cloud  is important in making a realistic comparison between experiment and hadron structure calculations .",

    "looking further ahead , we anticipate that some priority will be given to the improvement of computational techniques , so that the interaction of ref.@xcite , e.g. , can be used directly in the study of transitions to excited states , in analogy with the treatment of ground - state nucleon form factors @xcite .",
