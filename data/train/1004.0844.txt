    "recently , quantum portfolios of quantum algorithms encoded on two - level systems ( qbits ) have been reported @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that maximizing the efficiency of quantum calculations can be accomplished via the formation of portfolios of the algorithms and by minimizing both the running time and its uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , these portfolios have been shown to outperform single algorithms when applied to certain types of algorithms with variable running time such as the `` las vegas '' algorithms and np - complete problems such as combinatorial search algorithms . in this paper a discussion of quantum portfolios of algorithms encoded on qbits and their continuous variables ( cv ) version ( here , harmonic oscillators )",
    "is presented .",
    "continuous variables quantum computation performed with harmonic oscillators is discussed in @xcite .",
    "a quantum portfolio of algorithms is formed and a risk neutral model , analogous to the traditional black - scholes and merton @xcite options valuation model , is obtained from the underlying stochastic equations .",
    "the quantum algorithms are here encoded on simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) states , and a fokker - planck equation for the glauber p - representation is obtained as a starting point for the analysis .",
    "a portfolio of qbits is also formed and the resultant fokker - planck equation of the qbit polarization is used to obtain the risk neutral valuation of the portfolio and measurement option .",
    "the results should prove useful in quantum computation and decoherence .",
    "a simplified model for quantum computation is proposed wherein the algorithms are encoded on simple harmonic oscillator basis states and are in the presence of a thermal bath , the temperature decoherence effects needing to be taken into account as is usually the case in real - world applications . the quantum computation utilizing harmonic oscillator basis sets representations has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "representations of computation operators or effective operators can be made and the basis sets of these operators can be expressed as harmonic oscillator basis sets . for this case , we will also consider damping , this could be from other noise sources , external or system specific .",
    "the harmonic oscillator can be described by a master equation such as @xmath0{eqn1.png } \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are destruction and creation operators as usual , and @xmath3 is the density matrix operator .",
    "the mean thermal excitation due to the thermal bath is @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the damping rate @xcite . to obtain a fokker - planck equation for the sho ,",

    "these stochastic processes can now be included in a portfolio analysis . to construct a portfolio ,",
    "we first look at the case where the algorithm is encoded on two harmonic oscillators . it can be seen that a generalization to the multi - asset case proceeds straightforwardly .",
    "we write the legendre transform for the n - asset portfolio @xmath10 @xmath11{eqn7.png } \\label{eqn7}\\ ] ] and here , with @xmath12 , the function @xmath13 is the analogue to the ( call ) option in finance . in our case",
    ", it can represent the probability distribution for measurement of the observables of the quantum algorithm(s ) .",
    "these observables are legendre transformed such that the state function , the portfolio @xmath10 , evolves at the known or _ wanted _",
    "rate @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "the n algorithms evolve independently , regardless of initial phase , and will have differing instantaneous values in their stochastic sample paths .",
    "they all have in common the same value for their moments ( means and variances ) , as from the point of view of their statistics they have the same drift and diffusion coefficients and are equivalent on the average .",
    "this is different from the financial portfolio case where the portfolio of shares of a stock(s ) assets have the same instantaneous value for all the shares ( say , of a particular stock ) and would resemble a portfolio of different traded stocks of one share per stock that are different in prices at any instantaneous period in time yet that equivalently have the same values for their 1st and second moments of means and variances .",
    "next we expand @xmath16 in a taylor series to first order in time , and to 2nd order in the variables , since @xmath17 @xmath18{eqn8.png } \\label{eqn8}\\ ] ] setting @xmath12 for the two asset case , we take the differentials for @xmath19 .",
    "we have    @xmath6{eqn9.png } \\label{eqn9}\\ ] ]    and we substitute the expressions for @xmath16 and for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus we are able to make the choice for the @xmath22 multipliers directly @xcite as the @xmath23 terms .",
    "this immediately eliminates the drift terms in the original process , in favor of the known rate @xmath14 drift terms .",
    "this is a general feature in the sense that much more complex ( nonlinear ) process drifts can be eliminated in favor of the known rate @xmath14 linear drifts @xcite . upon making the substitutions",
    ", we obtain the backwards fokker - planck equation that corresponds to the black - scholes options pricing model .",

    "@xmath11{eqn19a.png } \\label{eqn19a}\\ ] ]    where these boundary values correspond to the terminal values of the evolution of the algorithms .",
    "these boundary values allow us to immediately integrate and obtain the solution for @xmath35 @xmath11{eqn19.png } \\label{eqn19}\\ ] ] the interpretation of this formal result for the delta function boundary values is that the value of the distribution of the observables of the quantum computation algorithm is evaluated at the later time @xmath35 and then evolved backwards to the present time @xmath36 similarly to the evaluation of the price of a financial instrument such as the call or put option in portfolio theory .",
    "other terminal boundary values can be made , such as step functions in direct analogy to insurance instruments . closed form solutions are also possible ,",
    "as the step function limits the integration and can be solved by several methods , and will not be discussed further here ... note that due to risk management strategies in portfolio theory having a direct correspondence to observation strategies for portfolios of quantum computation algorithms , alternative boundary values are likely to become important for different applications .",
    "also , as there are generalizations of the portfolio theory to beyond the risk neutral valuation model , the simple delta function boundary values and formal solution can be considered as a simplest observation strategy .",
    "an example of the implementation of the strategy of observations of the quantum computations is the analog of the delta hedging strategy .",
    "the deltas @xmath23 and @xmath37 should be kept as close to zero as possible to ensure the evolution of the portfolio as @xmath38 .",
    "this can be done by observing algorithms ( selling ) or adding algorithms ( buying ) to the portfolio at each computation time step .",
    "in a paper that describes realistic models of interferometric continuous measurement of qbit readout systems relevant to quantum computing @xcite , the author was able to describe the polarization of the qbit in terms of a fokker - planck pde that accounted for the randomness inherent in the measurement process .",
    "the result due to the interferometric measurement markov process was given by ( a similar analysis can be performed for the qbits in the presence of thermal noise ) @xmath27{eqn20.png } \\label{eqn20}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath40 is the drift velocity .",

    "the other terms in eq.([eqn20 ] ) are @xmath42 , the photon flux in photons per second , and @xmath43 , the phase shift due to perturbation of the qbit by a photon . the underlying ito stochastic differential equation can be readily obtained and is @xmath27{eqn2351.png } \\label{eqn2351}\\ ] ] and can be seen to contain complicated drift terms as well as the diffusion coefficients",
    ". this however will be the replacement by a linear drift term mentioned in the previous derivation .",

    "in this article , we have derived a risk neutral valuation model analogous to the black - scholes and merton derivatives valuation model .",
    "this model is derived for portfolios of assets of quantum algorithms in continuous variables .",
    "the fokker - planck equations for the qbits are the starting points for the derivation of the formal solutions for the derivatives which in this interpretation are the distributions for the measurement of the observables of the quantum computation algorithms of qbits encoded on harmonic oscillators and optics",
    ". risk neutral rate of evolution of the value of the portfolio @xmath15 and for which the statistics of the computation are derived for future terminal computation time @xmath35 formal solution brought back to the current time @xmath36 at the known or desired rate of return .",
    "this can be interpreted in several ways , including @xmath14 the probability of successful computation per computation time step , the number of successful computations algorithms per unit time step , etc . and is an analogy to the rate of return on investment in finance .",
