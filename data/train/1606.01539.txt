    "the linear variations of @xmath1 in the 540 - 600 k temperature range is due to insulator - to - metal transitions at @xmath2540 k. to understand the large and positive values of @xmath1 shown by the lacoo@xmath0 , we have also carried out the electronic structure and transport coefficients calculations by using the _ ab - initio _ density functional theory and boltztrap transport calculations , respectively .",

    "the flat energy curve observed in the band structure gives @xmath28 times larger effective mass of electrons in conduction band than the effective mass of holes in valence band .",
    "the large effective mass of electron plays an important role in understanding the large and positive seebeck coefficient exhibited by this compound .",
