    "<S> cool - down dynamics of superconducting accelerating cavities became particularly important for obtaining very high quality factors in srf cavities . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies proved that when cavity is cooled fast , the quality factor is higher than when cavity is cooled slowly . </S>",
    "<S> this has been discovered to derive from the fact that a fast cool - down allows better magnetic field expulsion during the superconducting transition . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we describe the first experiment where the temperature all around the cavity was mapped during the cavity cool - down through transition temperature , proving the existence of two different transition dynamics : a sharp superconducting - normal conducting transition during fast cool - down which favors flux expulsion and nucleation phase transition during slow cool - down , which leads to full flux trapping .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite that ambient magnetic field can be either fully trapped or fully expelled during the superconducting ( sc ) transition depending on the details of cavity cool - down through transition temperature . + in particular it has been shown that when the cool - down occurs fast , high thermogradients are present along the cavity ; in this case it has been suggested that the superconducting - normal conducting ( sc - nc ) interface moves sharply promoting efficient magnetic field expulsion . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when the cool - down occurs slowly , the thermogradients along the cavity are minimized and the sc - nc transition does not appear sharp but rather the nucleation regime involves the creation of normal conducting islands surrounded by superconducting phase , from which magnetic flux expulsion becomes less favorable , and therefore promoting magnetic flux trapping into these regions leading to high surface resistance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper we present for the first time the temperature mapping @xcite of the cavity during a fast and a slow cool - down , in order to visualize how the superconducting transition occurs in the two cases , and to verify the veridicity of previous hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> + in this experiment the cavity was placed horizontal respect to the cooling flux , at the fermilab vertical test facility ( vts ) , in order to study the cavity behavior in the same condition as cavity into the cryomodule of an accelerator . </S>",
    "<S> temperature sensors were fixed on @xmath0 boards , each equipped with @xmath1 thermometers , in order to monitor the temperature all around the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the thermometer number @xmath2 of board @xmath3 is located on the bottom of the cavity , whereas the thermometer number @xmath2 of board @xmath4 is located on top of the cavity . + the fast cool - down temperature mapping refers to a cool - down with starting temperature of @xmath5 , the starting temperature of the slow cool - down is @xmath6 instead . in the case of slow cool - down </S>",
    "<S> the starting temperature is close to the critical temperature in order to maintain the temperature as uniform as possible along the cavity during the transition . </S>",
    "<S> + the fast cool - down t - map images are shown in fig . [ fast ] , while the slow cool - down images are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ slow ] . in either cases </S>",
    "<S> the white color indicates the superconducting phase , which means the temperature measured is lower than @xmath7 .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +   +     +   +   +     +   +   +     +   +   +     +   +   +     +   +   +     +   +   +     +   +   +     +   +    from the tmap images appears clear that for the fast cool - down case the superconducting transition proceeds with a sharp sc - nc interface from the bottom to the top of the cavity during the cooling . </S>",
    "<S> + for the slow cool - down case the superconducting transition occurs with a very different dynamics : at the beginning islands of superconducting phase appear in random positions , oscillating between the sc - nc phases several times before stabilizing below tc . </S>",
    "<S> then , as the cool - down proceeds , they become larger and larger leading to a situation in which almost all the cavity becomes superconducting but some randomly distributed zones are still normal - conducting . </S>",
    "<S> + in this situation incomplete meissner effect easily occurs , the magnetic field expulsion from these nc regions surrounded by the sc phase is not energetically favorable , and magnetic field is randomly trapped all around the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario clearly prove that the high q performance shown by nitrogen doped niobium cavities fast cooled from above the critical temperature are due to the sharp sc - nc transition dynamics which optimize the magnetic flux expulsion and minimized the trapped flux dependent surface resistance . </S>"
