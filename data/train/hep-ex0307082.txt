    "studies of three - body charmless hadronic final states are a natural extension of studies of two - body final states . some of the final states considered so far as two - body ( for example @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc . )",
    "are , in fact , quasi - two - body since they produce a wide resonance state that immediately decays , in the simplest case , into two particles producing a three - body final state .",
    "multiple resonances occurring nearby in phase space will interfere and a full amplitude analysis is required to extract correct branching fractions for the intermediate quasi - two - body states . @xmath0 meson decays to three - body charmless hadronic final states may also provide new possibilities for cp violation searches .",
    "for example , a new method to extract the weak angle @xmath23 from isospin analysis and measurement of time dependent asymmetry in the decay @xmath24 has been recently suggested in ref .",
    "charmless decays of @xmath0 mesons are also important in current searches for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among three - body charmless final states , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays , which proceed via @xmath27 and @xmath28 transitions ,",
    "respectively , provide a good opportunity to search for new physics .",
    "the sm prediction for the branching fraction of the decay @xmath25 is of order @xmath29 and even smaller for the @xmath16 final state  @xcite .",
    "however , there are extensions of the sm where these branching fractions can be enhanced up to @xmath30  @xcite",
    ". upper limits on branching fractions for these final states can be used to constrain parameters in some extensions of the sm  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 meson decays to @xmath4 and @xmath5 final states have already been observed by the belle , babar and cleo experiments  @xcite .",
    "for the other three - body charmless hadronic final states considered in this paper only upper limits have been reported so far  @xcite . in this paper , we present updated results on a study of @xmath0 meson decays to three - body @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 final states .",
    "we also describe an isospin analysis of the decays of @xmath0 mesons to three - kaon final states and discuss the use of the @xmath17 three - body decay for cp violation measurements .",
    "the analysis is based on a 78fb@xmath18 data sample , which contains 85.0 million @xmath31 pairs , collected with the belle detector operating at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath20 collider  @xcite with a center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy at the @xmath19 resonance .",
    "the beam energies are 3.5 gev for positrons and 8.0 gev for electrons . for the study of the @xmath32 continuum background we use 8.3fb@xmath18 of data taken 60  mev below the @xmath19 resonance .",
    "the results presented here include the previous data and supersede the results on three - body charmless hadronic final states reported in ref .",

    "only the acc and cdc are used to separate charged pions and kaons since here the tof provides no additional discrimination .",
    "electromagnetic showering particles are detected in an array of 8736 csi(tl ) crystals that covers the same solid angle as the charged particle tracking system .",
    "the energy resolution for electromagnetic showers is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is in gev .",
    "electron identification in belle is based on a combination of @xmath39 measurements in the cdc , the response of the acc , and the position , shape and total energy deposition ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) of the shower detected in the calorimeter .",
    "the electron identification efficiency is greater than 92% for tracks with @xmath43  gev/@xmath38 and the hadron misidentification probability is below 0.3% .",
    "the magnetic field is returned via an iron yoke that is instrumented to detect muons and @xmath44 mesons .",
    "we use a geant - based monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to model the response of the detector and determine acceptance  @xcite .",
    "charged tracks are selected with a set of track quality requirements based on the average hit residual and on the distances of closest approach to the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "we also require that the track momenta transverse to the beam be greater than 0.1  gev/@xmath38 to reduce the low momentum combinatorial background . for charged kaon identification",
    ", we impose a requirement on the particle identification variable , which has 86% efficiency and a 7% fake rate from misidentified pions . charged tracks that are positively identified as electrons or protons",

    "the widths and the relative fractions of the two gaussians are determined from the mc simulation .",
    "we find that the signal mc events have a 10% narrower @xmath62 width than seen in the data . to correct for this effect , we introduce a scale factor that is determined from the comparison of the @xmath62 widths for @xmath63 events in mc and experimental data .",

    "since the two @xmath0 mesons produced from an @xmath68 decay are nearly at rest in the c.m .",

    "the remaining @xmath67 and @xmath31 events still have some differences in topology that are exploited for further continuum suppression .",
    "a fisher discriminant  @xcite is formed from 11 variables : nine variables that characterize the angular distribution of the momentum flow in the event with respect to the @xmath0 candidate thrust axis  @xcite , the angle of the @xmath0 candidate thrust axis with respect to the beam axis , and the angle between the @xmath0 candidate momentum and the beam axis .",
    "the discriminant , @xmath74 , is the linear combination of the input variables that maximizes the separation between signal and background .",

    "the separation between the mean values of the discriminant for the signal and background is approximately 1.3 times the signal width . for all @xmath1 and @xmath2 final states we impose a requirement @xmath77 on the fisher discriminant variable that rejects about 90% of the remaining continuum background and retains 54% of the signal .",
    "the continuum background in the three - kaon final states is much smaller and a looser requirement @xmath78 is imposed to retain the efficiency .",
    "this requirement rejects 53% of the remaining @xmath67 background and retains 89% of the signal .",
    "we also consider backgrounds that come from other @xmath0 decays .",
    "we subdivide this background into two types .",

    "the best known candidates for @xmath170 penguin - dominated processes , where this quantity can be measured independently , are @xmath171 and @xmath172 decays .",
    "however , the branching fractions for these decay modes are of order @xmath173 ( including secondary branching fractions ) and very large numbers of @xmath0 mesons are required to perform these measurements .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath174 final state .",
    "the large signal observed in the three - body @xmath17 decay mode , where the @xmath175 two - body intermediate state gives a relatively small contribution  @xcite , would significantly increase the available statistics if these events could be used .",
    "two complications are involved : ( 1 ) the @xmath81 tree contributions may introduce an additional weak phase in the @xmath17 amplitude and complicate the interpretation of any observed cp violation . the @xmath81 contribution in @xmath176",
    "is expected to be negligible ( since @xmath50 is almost a pure @xmath177 state ) , which is not necessarily the case for the three - body @xmath178 final state ; ( 2 ) in contrast to the @xmath175 state , which has fixed cp - parity , the cp - parity of the three - body @xmath178 final state is not a priori known .",
    "if the fractions of cp - even and cp - odd components are comparable , the use of the @xmath178 decay mode in a cp analysis will be complicated .",
    "although in this case an analysis of the proper time distribution would not be useful for cp violation measurement , the analysis of the time evolution of the dalitz plot may still provide useful information on cp violation in the @xmath178 final state . in what follows",
    "we discuss the possibility of using the three - body @xmath17 decay mode for cp violation measurements  @xcite .",
    "the decays of @xmath0 mesons to three - body @xmath179 final states can be described by @xmath81 tree - level spectator and @xmath180 one - loop penguin diagrams .",
    "although electroweak penguins , @xmath81 @xmath181-exchange , and annihilation diagrams can also contribute to these final states , they are expected to be much smaller and we neglect them in the following discussion . @xmath0",
    "meson decays to final states with odd numbers of kaons ( @xmath182-quarks ) are expected to proceed dominantly via the @xmath132 penguin transition since , for these states , the @xmath81 tree contribution has an additional ckm suppression .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 decays to three - body final states with two kaons proceed via the @xmath81 tree and @xmath131 penguin transitions with no @xmath132 penguin contribution .",
    "this allows us to make a rough estimate of the @xmath81 tree contribution to final states with three kaons via the analysis of @xmath2 final states .",
    "this is illustrated for the @xmath183 decay in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] , where the dominant @xmath170 penguin graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](a ) . the @xmath81 tree graph ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](b ) ) has an additional cabibbo suppression from the @xmath184 vertex . the corresponding diagram without cabibbo suppression ( @xmath185 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](d ) is expected to be the dominant contributor to the @xmath141 final state .",
    "assuming factorization , a quantitative estimate of the fraction of the @xmath81 tree amplitude is then provided by the ratio @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the total amplitude for the @xmath183 decay and @xmath188 is its @xmath81 tree contribution . the @xmath189 factor , where @xmath190  mev and @xmath191  mev are the pion and kaon decay constants , respectively , takes into account corrections for su(3 ) breaking effects in the factorization approximation .",
    "@xmath192 is the cabibbo angle ( @xmath193 )  @xcite . using the results for @xmath12 and @xmath183 branching fractions from table  [ tab : defit ] ,",
    "we obtain @xmath194 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath195 decays to @xmath6 and @xmath13 final states we find @xmath196 , where the value in brackets is obtained using the upper limit for the @xmath197 branching fraction .",
    "thus , the contribution of the @xmath81 tree transition is expected to be at the level of a few percent in branching fraction or at the level of @xmath198% in amplitude .",
    "in contrast to two - body decays , where the magnitude of the interference term depends only on the relative phase between two amplitudes , in three - body decay , for the interference term to be maximal not only must the relative phase between the two amplitudes be 0 ( 180 ) degrees at any point of the phase space , but these two amplitudes should also have identical behavior over the phase space .",
    "it seems unlikely that all these conditions will be satisfied since @xmath170 penguin and @xmath81 tree amplitudes are quite different in nature .",
    "we conclude that the above value is a rather conservative estimate of the @xmath81 contribution .",
    "let us now consider the cp content of the @xmath178 state in neutral @xmath0 decays .",
    "the cp - parity of the @xmath178 three - body system is @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath122 pair relative to the remaining neutral kaon . since the total angular momentum of the @xmath6 system is zero",
    ", @xmath200 is equal to the relative orbital angular momentum , @xmath201 , of the two charged kaons .",
    "thus , the relative fraction of cp - even and cp - odd states in the @xmath178 final state is determined by a fraction of states with even and odd orbital angular momenta in the @xmath122 system .",
    "this fraction could be determined by amplitude analysis of the @xmath17 dalitz plot .",
    "such an analysis requires high statistics and can not be performed with the available data .",
    "instead , we use isospin relations between the different three - kaon final states to determine the relative fraction of cp - even and cp - odd states . noting that the dominant @xmath132 penguin transition is an isospin conserving process , and neglecting the isospin violating @xmath81 tree and @xmath131 penguin contributions , we can write the following relations : @xmath202 @xmath203 where the factor @xmath204  @xcite takes into account the difference in total widths of charged and neutral @xmath0 mesons .",
    "being a mirror reflection of each other in isospin space , @xmath9 and @xmath205 decays should have not only equal partial widths ( equation  [ eq : rel_1 ] ) , but also the same decay dynamics ; specifically , the fraction of a certain angular momentum state in the @xmath122 system in the @xmath6 final state should be the same as that for the @xmath206 system in the @xmath207 final state .",
    "the @xmath205 decay produces three different observable states : @xmath7 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the relative fractions of these states depend on the relative fractions of even and odd orbital angular momentum states in the @xmath206 system .",
    "bose statistics requires that the @xmath206 wave function be symmetric ( and , therefore , cp - even ) , independently of the relative orbital angular momentum , @xmath201 , in the system of neutral kaons . as a result ,",
    "a @xmath206 system with @xmath201-even can only decay to @xmath210 or @xmath211 final states ( with equal fractions ) , while a @xmath212 system with @xmath201-odd can only decay to the @xmath213 final state ( with an accuracy up to cp violation effects in the system of neutral kaons ) .",

    "it also gives the fraction of states with even angular momenta in the @xmath122 system for the @xmath178 final state . with the results given in table  [ tab : defit ] , we obtain : @xmath218 , where we use the expression for @xmath216 in terms of signal yields ( @xmath219 ) and reconstruction efficiencies ( @xmath220 ) instead of branching fractions to reduce the systematic error due to uncertainty in branching fractions of the calibration modes .",
