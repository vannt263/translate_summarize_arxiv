    "porous media consist of a solid matrix within which fluids can circulate freely .",
    "the propagation of waves in these media has many crucial implications in applied mechanics , in situations where materials such as industrial foams , spongious bones @xcite and petroleum rocks @xcite have to be characterized , for example .",
    "the poroelastic model originally developed by biot in 1956 @xcite includes two classical waves ( one `` fast '' compressional wave and one shear wave ) , in addition to a second `` slow '' compressional wave , which is highly dependent on the saturating fluid .",
    "this slow wave was observed experimentally in 1981 @xcite , thus confirming the validity of biot s theory .",
    "two frequency regimes have to be distinguished when dealing with poroelastic waves .",
    "one of the main problems is how to model the dissipation of mechanical energy . in the low - frequency range ( lf )",
    "@xcite , the viscous boundary layer that develops in the fluid is large in comparison with the diameter of the pores , and the viscous efforts are proportional to the relative velocity of the motion between the fluid and solid components . in the high - frequency range ( hf ) , modeling the dissipation is a more delicate task : biot first presented an expression for particular pore geometries @xcite . in 1987 , johnson - koplik - dashen ( jkd ) @xcite published a general expression for the dissipation in the case of random pores .",
    "the viscous efforts depend in this model on the square root of the frequency of the perturbation . when writing the evolution equations in the time domain , time fractional derivatives are introduced , which involves convolution products with singular kernels @xcite .",
    "analytical solutions have been derived in simple academic geometries and homogeneous media @xcite .",
    "many numerical methods have been developed in the lf regime : see @xcite and the introduction to @xcite for general reviews . in the hf regime ,",
    "the fractional derivatives greatly complicate the numerical modeling of the biot - jkd equations .",
    "the past values of the solution are indeed required in order to evaluate these convolution products , which means that the time evolution of the solution must be stored .",
    "this of course greatly increases the memory requirements and makes large - scale simulations impossible . to our knowledge ,",
    "only two approaches to this problem have been proposed so far in the literature .",
    "the first approach consisted in discretizing the convolution products @xcite , and the second one was based on the use of a diffusive representation of the fractional derivative @xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "the convolution product is replaced by a continuum of diffusive variables - or memory variables - satisfying local differential equations @xcite .",
    "this continuum is then discretized using appropriate quadrature formulas , resulting in the biot - da ( diffusive approximation ) model .",
    "however , the diffusive approximation proposed in @xcite has three major drawbacks .",
    "first , the quadrature formulas make the convergence towards the original fractional operator very slow .",
    "secondly , in the case of small frequencies , the biot - da model does not converge towards the biot - lf model .",
    "lastly , the number of memory variables required is not specified .",
    "the aim of the present study is therefore to develop a new diffusive approximation method in which these drawbacks do not arise .",
    "since it is proposed here to focus on the discretization of the fractional derivatives , we will deal only with the 1-d equations of evolution in homogeneous media , so that the shear wave will not be considered .",
    "however , the strategy proposed here can be extended quite straightforwardly to 2d and 3d geometries , as discussed below .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the original biot - jkd model is briefly outlined in section [ secphys ] and the principles underlying the diffusive representation of fractional derivatives are described .",
    "the decrease of energy and the dispersion analysis are addressed . in section [ secda ] , the method used to discretize the diffusive model is presented : the diffusive approximation thus obtained is easily treatable by computers . following a similar approach than in viscoelasticity @xcite ,",
    "the coefficients of the model are determined using an optimization procedure in the frequency range of interest , giving an optimum number of additional computational arrays .",
    "the numerical modeling is addressed in section [ secnum ] , where the equations of evolution are split into two parts : a propagative part , which is discretized using a fourth - order scheme for hyperbolic equations , and a diffusive part , which is solved exactly .",
    "some numerical experiments performed with realistic values of the physical parameters are presented in section [ secexp ] . in section [ secconclu ] ,",
    "a conclusion is drawn and some futures lines of research are given .",
    "the biot model describes the propagation of mechanical waves in a macroscopic porous medium consisting of a solid matrix saturated with a fluid circulating freely through the pores @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that    * the wavelengths are large in comparison with the diameter of the pores ; * the amplitude of the perturbations is small ; * the elastic and isotropic matrix is completely saturated with a single fluid phase ; * the thermo - mechanical effects are neglected .",

    "<S> a time - domain numerical modeling of biot poroelastic waves is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the viscous dissipation occurring in the pores is described using the dynamic permeability model developed by johnson - koplik - dashen ( jkd ) . </S>",
    "<S> some of the coefficients in the biot - jkd model are proportional to the square root of the frequency : in the time - domain , these coefficients introduce order @xmath0 shifted fractional derivatives involving a convolution product . based on a diffusive representation , </S>",
    "<S> the convolution kernel is replaced by a finite number of memory variables that satisfy local - in - time ordinary differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the dispersion relation , the coefficients in the diffusive representation are obtained by performing an optimization procedure in the frequency range of interest . </S>",
    "<S> a splitting strategy is then applied numerically : the propagative part of biot - jkd equations is discretized using a fourth - order ader scheme on a cartesian grid , whereas the diffusive part is solved exactly . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons with analytical solutions show the efficiency and the accuracy of this approach .    </S>",
