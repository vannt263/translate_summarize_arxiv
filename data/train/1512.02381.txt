    "we then represent @xmath306 as a segment orthogonal to @xmath304 ( there are two possible choices of dimension ) , with @xmath296 as one endpoint , and such that @xmath306 lies inside @xmath305 .    in the remainder of the proof , we assume that @xmath2 contains a path @xmath307 , such that for any @xmath168 , the only neighbors of @xmath243 in @xmath2 are @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "let @xmath97 be the graph obtained from @xmath2 by removing all the vertices @xmath243 with @xmath168 , and let @xmath301 be a 3-segment representation of @xmath97 .",
    "we now extend @xmath303 to the vertices @xmath310 .",
    "for @xmath311 , fix a point @xmath312 such that some small ball @xmath313 centered in @xmath314 only intersects @xmath315 . assume without loss of generality that either @xmath298 is parallel to the @xmath245-axis and @xmath299 is parallel to the @xmath233-axis ( this includes the case where @xmath316 and @xmath297 are adjacent ) , or both @xmath298 and @xmath299 are parallel to the @xmath233-axis ( this includes the case where @xmath316 and @xmath297 are the same vertex ) .",
    "assume that @xmath317 and @xmath318 have radius at least @xmath151 , for some @xmath319 .",
    "we map @xmath320 to the segment @xmath321 that has @xmath322 as an endpoint , is parallel to the @xmath132-axis , has length @xmath151 , and goes in the direction of @xmath323 ( parallel to the @xmath132-axis ) .",
    "similarly , we map @xmath324 to the segment @xmath325 that has @xmath323 as an endpoint , is parallel to the @xmath245-axis , has length @xmath151 , and goes in the direction of @xmath322 ( parallel to the @xmath245-axis ) .",
    "let @xmath326 be the endpoint of @xmath321 distinct from @xmath322 , and let @xmath327 be the endpoint of @xmath325 distinct from @xmath323 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the 3-box with corners @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",
    "we map @xmath328 to the edge @xmath329 of @xmath58 which contains @xmath326 and is orthogonal to @xmath298 and @xmath321 , and similarly we map @xmath330 to the edge @xmath331 of @xmath58 which contains @xmath327 and is orthogonal to @xmath325 and @xmath299 . finally , we map @xmath332 to the edge @xmath333 of @xmath58 connecting the endpoint of @xmath329 distinct from @xmath326 and the endpoint of @xmath331 distinct from @xmath327 ( see figure  [ fig:5path ] ) .",
    "note that the description of @xmath315 , @xmath168 , above only depends of the choice of @xmath322 , @xmath326 , and @xmath151 .",
    "we now move each of @xmath322 , @xmath326 and the value of @xmath151 along a tiny interval .",
    "then the locus described by each @xmath315 , @xmath168 , is a non - degenerate 3-box .",
    "since @xmath303 is the union of a finite number of segments , it follows that we can choose @xmath322 , @xmath326 , and @xmath319 so that the @xmath315 ( @xmath168 ) are disjoint from @xmath303 .",
    "we can moreover choose @xmath322 , @xmath326 , and @xmath319 so that @xmath58 is a non - degenerate 3-box ( and so the @xmath315 are ( non - degenerate ) segments ) and no segment @xmath315 lie on the same line as a segment of @xmath303 .",
    "consequently , the obtained representation is a 3-segment representation and each vertex @xmath243 with @xmath168 is mapped to a segment that only intersects the segments of @xmath308 and @xmath309 , as desired .",
    "it was proved by galluccio , goddyn and hell  @xcite that for any proper minor - closed class @xmath7 and for any @xmath49 , there is an integer @xmath334 such that any graph of @xmath7 with girth at least @xmath5 is @xmath49-path - degenerate . since 3-segment representations are 3-box representations , we have the following immediate consequence .",
    "[ cor : minor ] for any proper minor - closed class @xmath7 there is an integer @xmath335 such that any graph of @xmath7 of girth at least @xmath5 has boxicity at most 3 .",
    "note that the result of galluccio , goddyn and hell was recently extended by neetil and ossona de mendez  @xcite to classes of subexponential expansion , i.e. expansion bounded by @xmath336 , for some @xmath319 ( see  @xcite for definitions and further details ) .",
    "this shows that corollary  [ cor : minor ] can be extended to this fairly broad setting as well .",
    "interestingly , the bound on the boxicity in corollary  [ cor : minor ] is best possible already for the class of @xmath337-minor free graphs .",
    "the following example was given by stphan thomass .",
    "take a copy of @xmath338 , the complete graph on 5 vertices , and replace each edge by an arbitrarily large path .",
    "the resulting graph has arbitrarily large girth , no @xmath337-minor , and any 2-box representation of it would give a planar embedding ( without crossings ) of @xmath338 , a contradiction .",
    "for graphs of euler genus @xmath5 , theorem 3.2 in  @xcite ( combined with theorem  [ thm:6path ] ) implies the following interesting counterpart of theorem  [ thm : locpla ] ( see the difference between the exponential bound there and the logarithmic bound here ) .",
    "[ cor : girth ] there is a constant @xmath27 such that any graph of euler genus @xmath5 and girth at least @xmath32 has boxicity at most 3 .",
    "observe that this is best possible up to the choice of the constant @xmath27 : for any integer @xmath49 , there is a constant @xmath339 and an infinite family of graphs of ( increasing ) euler genus @xmath5 , girth at least @xmath340 , and boxicity at least @xmath49 .",
    "this follows from the results of  @xcite mentioned in the introduction of this section , and the fact that the ramanujan graphs described in  @xcite have girth logarithmic in their number of vertices ( and euler genus linear in their number of vertices , at least for @xmath0-regular graphs with @xmath341 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that theorem  [ thm:6path ] can also be applied to classes that do not fit well in the framework of neetil and ossona de mendez  @xcite ( because their density is too high ) .",
    "examples of such classes include _ segment _ or _ strings _ graphs ( intersection graphs of segments , or strings in the plane ) , or _ circle _ graphs ( intersection graphs of chords of a circle ) .",
    "for example , it can be proved using theorem  [ thm:6path ] and the results of  @xcite that every circle graph of girth at least 9 has boxicity at most 3 .",
    "this is in contrast with the existence of a circle graph ( indeed , a permutation graph ) on @xmath342 vertices with boxicity @xmath343 , for every @xmath344 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a natural problem is to find a counterpart of theorem  [ thm : locpla ] for non - orientable surfaces .",
    "non - orientable versions of theorem  [ thm : placc ] exist  @xcite , so the only problem when applying the same arguments as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : locpla ] to a graph embedded in a non - orientable surface is that some of the cycles in the planarizing collection might be one - sided , in which case the cycle @xmath58 together with its neighborhood @xmath74 does not necessarily embed in a cylinder , but instead on a mbius strip . as a consequence ,",
    "these graphs are not necessarily planar . however , using lemma  [ lem : tech ] , we can prove that the graph obtained from the subgraph induced by @xmath80 by adding an edge between any two vertices of @xmath74 , has boxicity at most 4 ( just remove a vertex of @xmath58 and apply lemma  [ lem : tech ] ) .",
    "consequently , a proof along the lines of the proof of theorem  [ thm : locpla ] easily shows that locally planar graphs embedded on non - orientable surfaces have boxicity at most @xmath345",
    ".    it would be interesting to improve this bound , as well as that of theorem  [ thm : locpla ] .",
    "it was conjectured in  @xcite that locally planar graphs have boxicity at most 3 ( which would be best possible since there are planar graphs of boxicity 3 ) .",
    "we also conjecture the following variant :      note that the linear bound ( in @xmath5 ) would be best possible , since there are toroidal graphs with boxicity 4 ( for example @xmath347 minus a perfect matching , see  @xcite ) , and the disjoint union of @xmath348 such graphs can be embedded in a surface of euler genus @xmath5 ."
