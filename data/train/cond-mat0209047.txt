    "the advent of long - wavelength coherent sources , such as free - electron lasers ( fels),@xcite parametric generators with difference frequency mixing,@xcite terahertz ( thz ) antennas,@xcite and quantum cascade lasers@xcite has brought an entirely new class of opportunities to study low - energy phenomena in solid state systems in the time domain and/or high - intensity regimes . in particular ,",

    ", we carried out a dynamical study of the drude conductivity of transient plasmas .",
    "more specifically , we were able to directly determine the density and scattering lifetime of photocreated transient carriers as functions of time , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "another unique aspect of this technique lies in the fact that intraband fir / thz spectroscopy is independent of whether the states involved are interband - active or not , thus providing a rare opportunity to directly probe nonradiative ( or `` dark '' ) states .",
    "dynamics involving such states are not observable with conventional interband transient spectroscopies , e.g. , time - resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy .",
    "this unique ability makes it a powerful tool for providing insight into how optically created nonequilibrium electron - hole pairs lose their excess energies while relaxing toward the band edge through various scattering and thermalization processes before eventually recombining to luminesce.@xcite    in our previous work,@xcite we described the first demonstration of picosecond time - resolved cyclotron resonance ( trcr ) of photogenerated transient carriers by monitoring thz absorption as a function of magnetic field at fixed time delays between the nir pump pulse and thz probe pulse . in the present paper , we systematically investigated carrier relaxation in insb and gaas at different nir intensities and magnetic fields .",
    "our calculations based on a drude conductivity with @xmath1 and @xmath2 successfully reproduced the main observed features . by fitting the theoretical reflectivity versus time to the experimental curves",
    ", we found a linear dependence of the scattering rate , @xmath3 , on the carrier density , @xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that electron - electron scattering@xcite is the main factor in determining the carrier scattering lifetime inside the plasma in our density and time delay ranges .",
    "the application of a magnetic field in insb resulted in dramatic modifications in plasma dynamics whereas gaas did not show any strong magnetic field dependence up to 8 tesla .",
    "this behavior of insb can be attributed to the small effective masses of its carriers , which made the plasma , cyclotron , and photon energies all comparable , under our experimental conditions , and their subtle interplay led to the observed rich plasma dynamics .",
    "our theoretical simulations are in good qualitative agreement with the observations , supporting this explanation .",
    "the nir laser source was a ti : sapphire laser seeding a regenerative amplifier .",
    "the amplifier produced intense nir ( @xmath5 800 nm ) pulses with pulse duration of @xmath6 200 fs and pulse energies as high as @xmath6 1 mj at variable repetition rates up to 1 khz .",

    "the fel wavelength was mostly fixed to @xmath8 = 42 @xmath7 m ( or @xmath9 = 7.1 @xmath10 10@xmath11 hz or @xmath12 = 29.5 mev )",
    ". a schematic diagram of our experimental setup for the two - color spectroscopy experiments is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the nir output of the ti : sapphire system was directed through a computer controlled variable delay stage , after which it was spatially overlapped with the thz beam from the fel using a pellicle plate .",
    "the two beams were thus made collinear as they were focused onto the sample using a parabolic mirror .",
    "the nir pulse excited nonequilibrium carriers across the band gap of the sample , which then absorbed a fraction of the incident thz probe pulse .",
    "the transmitted and reflected thz beams were then recollimated and directed to liquid @xmath13he - cooled ge : ga photoconductive detectors .",
    "the thz output of the fel was a pulse train of 10 hz `` macropulses '' 5 ms in duration .",
    "these macropulses each contained many ( @xmath6 60,000 ) @xmath6 1 ps duration `` micropulses '' separated by 84.6 ns , corresponding to a repetition rate of 11.8 mhz .",
    "the micropulse - to - micropulse energy fluctuations were factored out using a thz reference detector ( not shown in fig . [ setup ] ) before the sample .",
    "the ti : sapphire oscillator was locked to the seventh harmonic of this repetition rate , i.e. , 82.6 mhz .",
    "our synchronization electronics allowed us to select a single nir pulse per fel macropulse . a combination of the optical delay stage and electronic delays in the synchronization allowed for selective delays from 0 to 84.6 ns with a picosecond resolution .",
    "with this arrangement , we were able to compare the intensities of the transmitted and reflected thz pulses before and after the nir pump pulse .",
    "the amounts of photoinduced change in thz transmission and reflection were recorded as functions of time delay .",
    "we then defined photoinduced absorption as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the reflectivity and transmissivity , respectively , which are functions of time delay , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are their equilibrium values , i.e. , before the arrival of the nir pump pulse . for insb , we determined , by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , that @xmath17 = 18% ( cf",

    "we wedged both samples by @xmath25 to avoid multiple - reflection interference effects , and polished down to @xmath26 @xmath7 m , still much thicker than the absorption depths of both insb and gaas at 800 nm .",
    "this has an impact on the carrier dynamics , as significant carrier diffusion into the sample occurs ( as discussed below ) .",
    "the sample was placed inside a 9 t/1.5 k horizontal - bore split - coil magnet system ( oxford instruments spectromag 4000 ) with sapphire cold windows and polypropylene room temperature windows .",

    "the transmission , reflection , and absorption of the thz probe beam are plotted against time delay .",
    "the wavelength of the thz probe was 42 @xmath7 m ( @xmath9 = 7.1 @xmath10 10@xmath11 hz , @xmath12 = 29.5 mev ) and the sample temperature was 1.5 k. each panel shows multiple traces corresponding to different nir intensities , with the maximum nir fluence at the sample estimated to be @xmath6 4 mj/@xmath23 .",
    "in both the gaas and insb samples , the photogenerated carriers cause an abrupt drop ( rise ) in the thz transmission ( reflection ) at timing zero .",
    "for example , at the maximum nir intensity , the transmission drop is @xmath29% ( complete transmission quenching ) in gaas and @xmath6 70% in insb .",

    "[ gaasinsb](c ) and [ gaasinsb](f ) were obtained from the measured transmission and reflection curves using eqn .",

    "the subsequent recovery of these photoinduced abrupt changes depends critically on the relaxation properties of the sample under study .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ gaasinsb ] that there are significant differences between gaas and insb . in general",
    ", the gaas sample shows smooth and monotonic temporal evolution throughout the entire time range presented here ( 0@xmath0800 ps ) , whereas the insb sample shows much more complicated behavior , exhibiting dynamic changes within the first @xmath6 400 ps . the decay of the transmission ( or absorption ) change in insb is far from monotonic , clearly showing multiple componets at high nir intensities .",
    "its reflection dynamics are even more intriguing , exhibiting a sign change ( positive to negative ) at a certain time delay , which sensitively depends on the nir pump intensity . as discussed in section iv , we can explain these dramatic differences between the two systems in terms of the importance of auger processes , well known non - radiative carrier recombination especially important in narrow gap semiconductors like insb.@xcite the much shorter absorption depth of insb as compared to gaas also favors the importance of auger recombination .",
    "the sensitivity to the _ total _ carrier density , not the density of the interband - active ( or radiative ) carriers alone , distinguishes the current spectroscopic technique from conventional transient spectroscopies based on interband transitions .",
    "the value of photoinduced reflectivity change is not a simple function of time delay or nir pump intensity .",
    "both its magnitude and sign depend on these parameters in a complicated manner .",
    "this is true even for gaas , for which the reflection curves look smooth and monotonic in fig .",
    "[ gaasinsb](b ) . to illustrate this point",
    ", we plotted the photoinduced reflectivity as a function of nir intensity for three different time delays in fig .",
    "[ gaaspower ] . here",
    "the data were taken by varying the intensity of the nir pump pulse while the time delay was kept constant .",
    "we can see that with increasing nir intensity the thz reflectivity can either increase or decrease , depending on the value of time delay .",
    "also , if the time delay is large enough , we see that the reflectivity initially decreases and then increases with the nir intensity .",
    "as we will see , the sign of the photoindiuced reflectivity change is governed by the interplay between the plasma frequency , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 @xmath32 ) , and the thz photon frequency , @xmath33 .      4 mj/@xmath23 ) and ( b ) low ( @xmath615 @xmath7j/@xmath23 ) nir excitations in insb at 1.5 k. traces are vertically offset for clarity . ]    since gaas did not exhibit any magnetic field dependence in our accessible magnetic field range , here we concentrate on the data from insb",
    ". figures [ mpr - exp](a ) and [ mpr - exp](b ) show photoinduced reflectivity versus time delay for insb at various fixed magnetic fields for high ( @xmath6 4 mj/@xmath23 ) and low ( @xmath6 15 @xmath7j/@xmath23 ) excitations , respectively , at a temperature of 1.5 k. the data exhibit qualitatively different behavior under these different excitation conditions .",
    "all the traces in fig . [ mpr - exp](a ) show significant photoinduced _ enhancement _ in reflectivity immediately after photoexcitation .",
    "this is because the plasma energy of the photocreated carriers initially exceeds the photon energy of the thz probe ( 29.5 mev or 7.1 thz ) .",
    "the estimated initial carrier density in the high - excitation case is of the order of @xmath6 10@xmath34 @xmath21 , which corresponds to a plasma energy of @xmath6 250 mev ( or 60 thz ) .",
    "the low - excitation data at @xmath28 = 0 t , on the other hand , shows a reflectivity _ drop _ due to the created carriers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mpr - exp](b ) .",
    "however , this completely opposite behavior very quickly disappears as we increase the magnetic field from 0 to 1.5 t. a small peak emerges in reflectivity , which grows in intensity with increasing magnetic field , reaches a maximum at @xmath6 3 t , stays roughly constant up to @xmath6 5 t , and finally goes away at higher magnetic field .",
    "this very interesting behavior is explainable in terms of the tuning of the plasma energy by the magnetic field,@xcite or the interplay between the plasma energy and the cyclotron energy , as discussed in more detail in section iv.b .",
    "we developed a theory for the reflectivity of a transient plasma as a function of carrier density ( @xmath4 ) , scattering time ( @xmath35 ) , and magnetic field ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "after being created by the nir laser beam , the carrier population decreases on a picosecond time scale .",
    "while there are a number of possible decay mechanisms , the dominant one , especially in narrow gap semiconductors at high densities ( which is the case for insb in this study ) , is known as auger relaxation.@xcite in this non - radiative decay mechanism , an electron and a hole recombine and the resulting energy is transferred to a third carrier . in this decay mechanism ,",
