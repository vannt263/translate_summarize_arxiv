    "ionic models of the cellular membrane potential are typically guided by extensive data sets from voltage clamp experiments .",
    "the purpose of this paper is not to introduce a new ionic model incorporating the many experimentally observed currents ( boyett , 1996 ) , or to critically review other models , but merely to give an alternative formulation based on simple principles from classical physics . instead of trying to reproduce",
    "observed voltage clamp data and tail currents of activation , deactivation and inactivation , we demonstrate that simple energy considerations and conservation laws can be useful when formulating a model .",
    "we derive equations for ionic currents flowing through channels , exchangers and electrogenic pumps .",
    "these are based on the boltzmann distribution law ( boltzmann , 1868 ) , which states that a particle in thermal equilibrium spends less time in states of higher energy than in states of lower energy , the markov assumption ( markov , 1906 ) which says that the transition probabilities to the next state of a stochastic system is only dependent on its present state , and the principle of detailed balance ( onsager , 1931 ) which says that the microscopic laws of physics are invariant with respect to the reversal of time .",
    "our equations were inspired by ehrenstein and lecar s model of channel gating ( 1977 ) , mullins model of the @xmath0 exchanger ( 1977 ) , and chapman s model of the @xmath1 pump ( 1978 ) .",
    "since the intracellular ionic concentrations are treated as dynamical variables , we show that the standard differential equation for the membrane potential can be replaced with a new algebraic equation .",
    "we demonstrate that the pump generates a transmembrane voltage gradient , a transmembrane pressure gradient , transmembrane concentration gradients , and downhill ionic fluxes through the exchanger and the channels .",
    "the theory is illustrated with a simple model of spontaneously active cells in the rabbit sinoatrial node .",
    "the observable parameters in the model are based on the experiments of shibasaki ( 1987 ) , hagiwara _ et al . _",
    "( 1988 ) , muramatsu _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) and sakai _ et al . _",
    "the non  observable parameters in the model are determined numerically , in the same way as in an earlier study ( endresen , 1997a ) , by comparing the action potentials generated by the model with the action potentials recorded by baruscotti _",
    "there are two basic principles behind the average motion of particles .",
    "the first is diffusion which is general ; the second applies only to charged particles such as ions in solutions .",
    "simple diffusion is described by the empirical law of fick : @xmath2 \\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the ionic flux , @xmath4 $ ] the concentration of ions and @xmath5 the ratio of the velocity to the force acting on a particle , known as the mobility .",

    "since we assume that the temperature is constant , we can neglect the thermal flux given by fourier s empirical law .",
    "the fact that the mobility in fick s law must be identical to the mobility in ohm s law was first noticed by einstein ( 1905 ) .",
    "if we combine equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , the total flux of ions due to diffusion and electric forces becomes : @xmath10 \\exp\\left(\\frac{zev}{kt}\\right)\\right ] \\;.\\ ] ]    the equilibrium potential where the flux is zero can be found by integrating equation ( [ eq3 ] ) from the intracellular ( i ) to the extracellular ( e ) side of the membrane : @xmath11_{\\rm e } } { [ { \\rm s}]_{\\rm i}}\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath4_{\\rm i}$ ] and @xmath4_{\\rm e}$ ] refer to the intracellular and extracellular concentrations .",
    "this equation , first stated by nernst ( 1888 ) is based only on the empirical laws of ohm and fick and the relation of einstein .",
    "the same formula can be derived in a more general way using the boltzmann factor ( boltzmann , 1868 ) . the relative probability at equilibrium that an ion is at the intracellular or extracellular side of a cell membrane is @xmath12_{\\rm e}}{[{\\rm s}]_{\\rm i } } = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta w}{kt}\\right ) \\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the energy difference between these intra and extracellular states , @xmath14 is the absolute temperature and @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "if we consider ions of valence @xmath7 the energy difference between the intracellular and extracellular side can be written : @xmath16    this together with equation ( [ eq8 ] ) yields equation ( [ eq6 ] ) . the equilibrium potentials for the predominant cellular cations are then : @xmath17_{\\rm e}}{[{\\rm k}]_{\\rm i}}\\ ; , \\\\",

    "each channel is here assumed to be a simple markov process ( markov , 1906 ) , described by first order kinetics : : @xmath18 where the rate constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 are functions of transmembrane voltage and control the transitions between the closed ( @xmath21 ) and the open ( @xmath22 ) states of the channel .",
    "the rate for a closed channel to open is @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the rate for an open channel to close .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the average fraction of channels that are open , or , equivalently , the probability that a given channel will be open .",
    "we may say that the ionic flux through an ensemble of channels is regulated by a sliding door whose position is @xmath23 .",
    "this yields : @xmath24 where @xmath25    here @xmath26 denotes the steady state fraction of open channels and @xmath27 the relaxation time . let us assume that the energy difference between the closed and open positions is given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is an gating charge , usually @xmath30 , the term @xmath31 is due to the difference in mechanical conformational energy between the two states and @xmath32 represents the change in electrical potential energy due to the redistribution of charge during the transition . at equilibrium , @xmath33 , and",
    "the ratio of the probabilities for a single channel to be in the open state or the closed state is , @xmath34    this relation is known as the principle of detailed balance ( onsager , 1931 ) .",
    "the same ratio is given by the boltzmann distribution ( boltzmann , 1868 ) , @xmath35    thus , from equations ( [ eq29 ] ) , ( [ eq30 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) :    @xmath36}\\right)^{-1 } \\;,\\ ] ]    and    @xmath37 } { \\exp\\left[+\\frac{(v_{\\rm x}-v)}{\\frac{kt}{2e}}\\right ] } \\;.\\ ] ]    therefore , making the _ ad hoc _ assumption that the product of forward and backward reaction rates is constant , the symmetric choice for @xmath38 and @xmath39 is :    @xmath40 \\\\",

    "we can view these mechanisms as two independent markov processes , or equivalently two independent sliding doors , which are both affected by voltage .",
    "an ion can only go through if both sliding doors are at least slightly open .",
    "the activation mechanism is very fast , so we use the steady state fraction of open channels ( equation ( [ eq32 ] ) ) for this .",
    "the maximum time constant of inactivation for calcium and sodium channels are of the same order of magnitude as the maximum time constant of the activation of the potassium channel , thus :    and ,    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the conductances of the calcium and sodium currents respectively , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given by equations ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the half ",

    " inactivation potentials .",
    "the na , k  atpase is found in the plasma membrane of virtually all animal cells and is responsible for active transport of sodium and potassium .",
    "low sodium concentration and high potassium concentration in the cytosol are essential for basic cellular functions such as excitability , secondary active transport , and volume regulation . in our model ,",
    "the @xmath56 pump is the only energy source .",
    "we shall assume that the following equation is a complete macroscopic description of the pump reaction ( chapman , 1978 ) :    @xmath57    where atp , adp and @xmath58 are adenosine triphosphate , adenosine diphosophate and inorganic phosphate , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the rates of the forward and backward reactions .",
    "the energy involved in the movement of 3 @xmath59 and 2 @xmath60 ions against their electrochemical gradients is :    @xmath61    where @xmath46 and @xmath62 are given by equations ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "this result is independant of the detailed interaction between ions , molecules and the atpase enzyme .",
    "therefore , the total work done in reaction ( [ eq48 ] ) is : @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the energy associated with the breakdown of atp .",
    "the ratio of @xmath38 to @xmath39 is again given by equations ( [ eq30 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) .",
    "the energy available from atp breakdown is much larger than the energy required to translocate the potassium and sodium ions at small negative membrane potentials . in practice , such a pump or motorized swing door will soon reach saturation .",
    "we therefore choose the rate of the forward reaction to be constant , resembling the maximum possible speed of the swing door in that direction , and obtain : @xmath65 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a constant .",

    "cardiac calcium currents have been classified into a long lasting type ( @xmath118 ) and a transient type ( @xmath119 ) , while cardiac delayed rectifier potassium currents have been classified into a rapid type ( @xmath120 ) and a slow type ( @xmath121 ) . in our model",
    "we assume that @xmath119 and @xmath121 are of minor importance ; i.e. when we talk about @xmath83 we mean @xmath122 , and when we talk about @xmath82 we mean @xmath120 .",
    "first , we want to justify the presence of the term @xmath123 in equations ( [ eq36 ] ) , ( [ eq37 ] ) and ( [ eq38 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a slope factor for the activation and inactivation curves of @xmath124 at @xmath125 .",
    "the observed slope factors are @xmath126 for activation of @xmath82 ( shibasaki , 1987 ) , @xmath127 for activation of @xmath83 ( hagiwara _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ) , @xmath128 for inactivation of @xmath83 ( hagiwara _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ) , @xmath128 for activation of @xmath84 ( muramatsu _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) , and , finally , @xmath129 for inactivation of @xmath84 ( muramatsu _ et al . _ ,",
    "hence , we see that @xmath130 , corresponding to a gating charge of @xmath30 , is an excellent approximation .",
    "now , we would like to distinguish between the fundamental physical constants ( table [ table1 ] ) , the experimentally observed constants ( table [ table2 ] ) , the adjustable parameters ( table [ table3 ] ) and the initial conditions ( table [ table4 ] ) in the model .",
    "the half  activation and inactivation potentials in the model ( @xmath131 , @xmath52 , @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath55 ) are based on the experiments of shibasaki ( 1987 ) , hagiwara _ et al . _",
    "( 1988 ) and muramatsu _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , and we use a value of @xmath132 that gives a reversal potential for the sodium pump in good agreement with the experiments of sakai _ et al . _",
    "the maximum time constants in these experiments were @xmath133 for activation of @xmath82 ( shibasaki , 1987 ) , @xmath134 for inactivation of @xmath83 ( hagiwara _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ) and @xmath135 for inactivation of @xmath84 ( muramatsu _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) . in the model , however , we combine these and use a maximum time constant of @xmath136 for both @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "finally , we use typical values for cell volume , cell capacitance , and extracellular ionic concentrations .    the density of ionic channels , exchangers and pumps ( i.e. @xmath140 , @xmath49 , @xmath45 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) can vary significantly from cell to cell . in order to reproduce the action potentials recorded in a spontaneously beating adult rabbit sinoatrial node cell with normal tyrode solution as external super fusing solution ( fig . 7 a. in baruscotti _",
    "( 1996 ) ) , we fit the adjustable parameters ( table [ table3 ] ) and the initial conditions ( table [ table4 ] ) numerically .",
    "more details are given in ( endresen , 1997a ) .",
    "many combinations of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath45 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 resulted in good approximations to the experimentally recorded waveform , from which we conclude that different cells can produce the same action potential although they have a different mixture of ionic channels , exchangers and pumps .",
    "the final set of parameters presented in table [ table3 ] are based on the choice @xmath143 .",
    "the six differential equations in the model were solved numerically using a fifth  order runge ",
    "kutta method with variable steplength , more details are given in ( endresen , 1997b ) .",
    "2 shows the five membrane currents and fig .",
    "3 shows the recorded and simulated action potentiald together with the intracellular ionic concentrations .",
    "these computations used the initial conditions stated in table [ table4 ] .",
    "cells must generate their membrane potential by actively transporting ions against their concentration gradients . to examine this process in our model , we ran a simulation starting with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations : @xmath144_{\\rm i } }   & = & 5.4 \\ , { \\rm mm } \\nonumber \\ ; ,",
    "\\\\ \\label{eq73 } { [ \\rm ca]_{\\rm i } } & = & 2 \\ , { \\rm mm } \\ ; , \\\\ { [ \\rm na]_{\\rm i } } & = & 140 \\ , { \\rm mm } \\nonumber \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     +   +    the results are presented in fig .",
    "4 . after approximately 1500 seconds ( 25 minutes )",
    "the system appears to reach a stable fixed point with the following intracellular ionic concentrations : @xmath144_{\\rm i } }   & = & 115.842881 \\ , { \\rm mm } \\nonumber \\ ; , \\\\ \\label{eq74 } { [ \\rm ca]_{\\rm i } } & = & 4.485016 \\cdot 10 ^{-5 } \\ , { \\rm mm } \\ ; , \\\\ { [ \\rm na]_{\\rm i } } & = & 33.548671 \\ , { \\rm mm } \\nonumber \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at 2500 seconds we kick the cell with a @xmath145 pulse of potassium ions with duration @xmath146 to see if it wants to oscillate .",
    "it surely does , and the oscillations soon become almost identical to the original oscillations present in fig . 2 and 3 ( you can not see this from fig .",
    "4 since the time scale is much to big ) .",
    "the values for the concentrations only differ slightly from the initial conditions in table [ table4 ] , as indicated by the final concentrations calculated by the program ( at 5000 seconds ) : @xmath144_{\\rm i } }   & = & 131.075490 \\ , { \\rm mm } \\nonumber \\ ; , \\\\ \\label{eq75 } { [ \\rm ca]_{\\rm i } } & = & 6.827191 \\cdot 10 ^{-4 } \\ , { \\rm mm } \\ ; , \\\\ { [ \\rm na]_{\\rm i } } & = & 18.320693 \\ , { \\rm mm } \\nonumber \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]   +   +    the trajectory reaches the limit cycle at 2560 seconds , and there is no drift in the intracellular ionic concentrations from this point to the end of the simulation ( at 5000 seconds ) . the long time simulation in fig .",
    "4 is a numerical indication that the oscillation in fig .",
    "2 and 3 is indeed a stable limit cycle .",
    "however , the model also has a stable fixed point given by ( [ eq74 ] ) .",
    "we have presented a simple model for the cells of the rabbit sinoatrial node .",
    "our model involves only @xmath56 , and @xmath147 ions , their respective channels , the @xmath148 exchanger , and the @xmath56 pump .",
    "the equations were derived using basic physical principles and conservation laws .",
    "since the only source of energy in our model is the sodium pump , we could easily track the flow of energy in our system .",
    "we showed that the pump works to generate a transmembrane voltage , pressure gradient and ionic concentration gradients .",
    "our equations also accounted for the energy lost due to downhill ionic fluxes through the exchanger and channels .",
    "a prediction of osmotic pressure variations was a novel result of our energy analysis .",
    "the intracellular ionic concentrations are dynamic variables in our model , governed by the conservation equations ( [ eq58 ] ) , ( [ eq59 ] ) , and ( [ eq60 ] ) .",
    "this allowed us to replace the standard differential equation for the voltage ( [ eq57 ] ) with the algebraic equation ( [ eq63 ] ) .",
    "although a number of other ionic models also keep track of intracellular ionic concentrations ( see wilders ( 1993 ) ) , we are unaware of any other model using an algebraic equation for the membrane potential",
    ". models that use the standard voltage differential equation ( [ eq57 ] ) have a superfluous extra dimension .",
    "furthermore , the initial conditions for this extra differential equation can not be chosen independently of the initial conditions of the conservation equations ( [ eq58 ] ) , ( [ eq59 ] ) , and ( [ eq60 ] )  otherwise , the computed membrane potential will be erroneous . for these reasons , we suggest that our algebraic expression for the membrane potential should replace the standard voltage differential equation in models where intracellular ionic concentrations are dynamic variables .      our model does not include funny current ( @xmath149 ) , atp sensitive channels , stretch - activated channels , or other ion channels that may be important ( boyett , 1996 ) .",
    "we also ignored the effect of calcium uptake and release from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum , and the effect of anions like chloride .",
    "we have assumed that the ionic channels are governed by a markov process .",
    "however , since transmembrane proteins can have a large number of conformational states ( liebovitch , 1995 ) , perhaps a fractal model for the gating would be a better approach .",
    "we assumed that the maximum of the activation / inactivation time constant occurs at the same voltage as the inflection point of the sigmoidal steady state activation / inactivation curve .",
    "also , we have assumed that the cell volume is constant .",
    "while such assumptions reduce the number of parameters in the model , they may also result in discrepancies with experiment .",
    "a natural extension of our model would include a variable cell volume .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that our model is based on experiments where some were conducted at room temperature ( 22@xmath150 ) ( baruscotti _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; muramatsu _ et al . _ , 1996 ) , while others were performed at @xmath151 ( shibasaki , 1987 ; hagiwara _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ; sakai _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "it is not clear what affect this inconsistency had on the accuracy of our model .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath45 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , given in table [ table3 ] , are only an estimate of the actual physiological parameters .",
    "we did not systematically study the dynamics of the model for different parameters .",
    "however , interested readers can download the source code for the model ( in both unix and windows nt environments ) from the following internet site :        lars petter endresen would like to thank professor jan myrheim for his wonderful way of explaining classical physics , and professor per jynge for giving a fascinating introduction to the exciting field of cardiac electrophysiology . discussions with per hemmer , johan skule hye , kre olaussen , michael guevara , michael mackey and jacques belair have been essential .",
