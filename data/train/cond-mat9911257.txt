    "( in the following we call systems `` non - extensive '' in a somewhat more general sense : if they are divided into pieces , their entropy is not the sum of the entropies of their parts in contrast to conventional extensive systems where this is assumed at least if the pieces are themselves macroscopic ) .",
    "although the largest systems possible belong to this group we call these systems `` small '' .",
    "but also at phase transitions in systems with short range forces does the entropy of the surface separating the different phases not scale with the size of the system .",
    "lateron we _ define systems to be `` small '' precisely by the condition that the entropy @xmath16 does not scale with the number of particles or the volume and especially if @xmath16 has some convex regions . _",
    "most applications of thermodynamics to `` small '' systems are more or less transcriptions from the thermodynamics of macroscopic systems , c.f .",
    "the book by hill @xcite .",
    "conventional thermo - statistics , however , relies heavily on the use of the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath17 ) and extensivity , c.f .",
    "e.g. the book of pathria @xcite .",
    "this is certainly not allowed for our systems .",
    "extensivity is nowadays considered to be an essential condition for thermodynamics to work , c.f .",
    "lieb and ygnvason @xcite .",
    "that the _ micro - canonical _ statistics works well also for `` small '' systems without invoking extensivity will be demonstrated here for finite normal systems .",
    "the use of the thermodynamic limit and of extensivity , however , is closely intervowen with the development of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics since its beginning more than hundred years ago . when we extend thermodynamics to `` small '' systems we should establish the formalism of thermodynamics starting from mechanics in order to remain on a firm basis .",
    "this is an old program since boltzmann and einstein @xcite .",
    "we will see how this idea guides us to more and deeper insight into the most dramatic phenomena of thermodynamics , phase transitions .",
    "moreover , it gives the most natural extension of thermo - statistics to some non - extensive systems without invoking any modification of the entropy like that proposed by tsallis @xcite see also @xcite .    in the following section we sketch a deduction of thermo - statistics from the principles of mechanics alone .",
    "nothing outside of mechanics must be invoked .",
    "this was the starting point of boltzmann @xcite , gibbs @xcite , einstein @xcite and the ehrenfests @xcite at the beginning of this century .",
    "they all agreed on the logical hierarchy of the micro - canonical as the most fundamental ensemble from which the canonical , and grand - canonical ensembles can be deduced under certain conditions . according to gibbs the latter two approximate the micro ensemble in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many particles if the system is homogeneous .",
    "then surface effects and fluctuations can be ignored relatively to the bulk mean values .",
    "this is the main reason why the thermodynamic limit became basic in the statistical foundation of macroscopic thermodynamics .",
    "however , it was gibbs @xcite who stressed that the equivalence of the three ensembles is not even true at phase transitions of first order , even in the thermodynamic limit",
    ".    this chapter repeats the familiar deduction of statistical mechanics as it was first formulated by gibbs @xcite .",
    "however , we will indicate at which point the main stream of logical steps towards a thermodynamics of `` large '' systems has to be left in order to cover also `` small '' and non - extensive systems .",
    "just a remark is neccessary here : one might think that a small system embedded in a heat bath may be described by the canonical or even the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "a heat bath interacts with the system via its surface . for small systems",
    "these surface mechanisms are important .",
    "they affect the physical properties and must be specified .",
    "certainly more must be controlled in such cases than just the mean energy ( temperature ) as is assumed in a canonical treatment .",
    "this would be only correct for an infinite system , with short range interactions , and if we wait an infinitely long time , then the details of the physical mechanisms in the surface contacting the system with the bath become unimportant relatively to the bulk .    the third section addresses phase transitions .",
    "first , the basics of the conventional definition of phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath18 ) by the theory of yang and lee @xcite are reminded .",
    "then this definition is translated into the micro - canonical picture and the source of the non - analyticities of the canonical thermodynamic potentials is traced to the topology of the micro - canonical entropy function , esp . its curvature .    in the fourth section",
    "we explain the general features of the micro - canonical phase diagram as function of fixed energy density ( @xmath19 ) and particle number- ( @xmath20)/magnetization - density , at first , with the well known example of the ising model and the ( @xmath21 ) diluted potts model . it is shown how its phase space is limited by the line of random configurations which have the maximum possible entropy .",
    "further the region of `` field driven '' phase separation into spontaneously magnetized clusters ( first order transition ) can be well studied in the energy - magnetization or the energy - particle number phase diagram .",
    "( remark : the distinction between `` field driven '' and `` temperature driven '' transition makes sense only for the ising model . due to its intrinsic symmetry @xmath22 the energy- axis is also the main curvature direction for @xmath23 .",
    "this is of course not the case for systems without this symmetry . )",
    "then the diluted potts model with @xmath4 is introduced .",
    "it is sketched which features of its phase diagram are to be expected in the case of a `` small '' system .",
    "section v gives a short discussion of the main steps of the simulation and in the section vi the numerical results are shown .",
    "we present the first view of the entire entropy - density surface @xmath24 as function of energy density ( @xmath25 ) and particle number density ( @xmath26 ) for the diluted ( @xmath4)-potts model on a _ finite _ 2-dim lattice with `` volume '' @xmath27 .",
    "as third variable as this is always hold fixed . of course for finite systems the _ shape _ of the container matters . in the diluted potts model we use a square lattice with periodic boundaries ( `` square torus '' ) . ]",
    "more insight into the phase diagram of the model is given by an overall view of the determinant of the curvature density @xmath28 .",
    "various kinds of phase transitions and critical lines can be seen and classified .",
    "a subsection is addressed to the essential differences between the micro - canonical and the grand - canonical phase diagram .",
    "the information lost by the latter representation is emphasized .",
    "the following section discusses the validity of the second law of thermodynamics in non - extensive systems with a convex @xmath24 .",
    "the consequences of convexity of the entropy for weinhold s geometric interpretation of thermodynamics are discussed .",
    "it will be explained that a convexity of @xmath2 is not in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "finally , our main conclusions on phase transitions in `` small '' non - extensive systems are summarized in section viii .",
    "an equilibrated many - body system is characterized by few macroscopic quantities :    1 .   its energy @xmath1 , mass ( number of atoms ) @xmath29 , volume @xmath30 , 2 .",
    "its entropy @xmath31 , 3 .",
    "its temperature @xmath32 , pressure @xmath33 , and chemical potential @xmath34 .",
    "there are important qualitative differences between these three groups : all variables of the first group have a clear mechanical significance .",
    "they are conserved and well defined at each point of the n - body phase space .",
    "the internal dynamics of the system can not leave the shell in phase space which is defined by these variables . also entropy as the most important quantity within thermodynamics has a clear mechanical foundation since boltzmann .",
    "his gravestone has the famous epitaph :    relating the entropy @xmath31 to the size @xmath35 of the energy ( @xmath1 ) surface in the n - body phase space at given volume ( @xmath30 ) . here",
    "@xmath36 is a suitable small energy constant which does not affect any variation of the entropy , @xmath37 is the @xmath29-particle hamiltonian , and @xmath38 the set of points on this surface defines the micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "in contrast to the conserved quantities which are defined at each phase space point , the entropy refers to the whole micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "remark : for a system with discrete energies @xmath39 e.g. a lattice or a quantum system with energy spacing @xmath36 one should define the micro - canonical partition sum by the number of states at this energy . when we discuss derivatives of @xmath40 we imagine a suitable smoothing of this .",
    "it is important to notice that boltzmann s and also einstein s formulation allows for _ defining the entropy entirely within mechanics _ by @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "it is a single valued , non - singular , in the classical case multiply differentiable , function of all _ `` extensive '' , conserved _ dynamical variables .",
    "no thermodynamic limit must be invoked and this definition applies to non - extensive like our `` small '' systems as well .",
    "the third group of quantities which characterize the thermodynamical state of an equilibrated many - body system , temperature , pressure and chemical potential have no immediate mechanical significance . within micro - canonical statistics they are",
    "_ defined _ by the derivatives of the entropy @xmath16 vs. the conserved quantities : @xmath42 from the mechanical point of view they are secondary , derived quantities .",
    "this difference to the two other groups of variables will turn out to be significant for `` small '' systems . again , like entropy itself , these quantities characterize the whole micro - canonical ensemble , not an individual point in the n - body phase space .",
    "starting from this point , the conventional thermo - statistics assumes extensivity and explores the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath43 ) c.f .",
    "this procedure follows gibbs @xcite .",
    "he introduced the canonical ensemble , which since then is the basic of all modern thermo - statistics .",
    "the link between both ensembles is established by a laplace transform .",
    "e.g. the usual grand - canonical partition sum is the double laplace transform of the micro - canonical partition sum @xmath44 : @xmath45/t}}=\\frac{v^2}{\\epsilon_0}{\\int\\rule{-3.5mm}{0mm}\\int}_0^{\\infty}{de\\;dn\\;e^{-v[e-\\mu n - ts(e , n , v)]/t}}\\label{grandsum}.\\ ] ] in the thermodynamic limit it is useful to work with the energy density @xmath19 , the particle number density @xmath20 , and the entropy density @xmath46 , cf . the right expression in eq.([grandsum ] ) .",
    "according to yang and lee @xcite phase transitions are indicated by singularities of the grand - canonical potentials ( @xmath47 $ ] ) as function of @xmath48 on the positive real @xmath49-axis .",
    "these , however , can occur in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath50 ) only . for finite volumes",
    "the number of particles @xmath29 is finite .",
    "consequently , @xmath51 is a sum of a finite number of powers @xmath52 and @xmath53 $ ] is analytical for positive @xmath49 at any @xmath32 . are there no phase transitions in finite systems ?    there are phenomena observed in finite systems which are typical for phase transitions .",
    "sometimes this is even so in astonishingly small systems like nuclei and atomic clusters of @xmath54 atoms @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "we showed that their characteristic parameters as transition temperature , latent heat , and _",
    "surface tension _ are  in the case of some metals  already for thousand atoms close , though of course not equal , to their known bulk values .",
    "therefore , it seems to be fully justified to speak in these cases of phase transitions of first order .",
    "we need an extension of thermodynamics to `` small '' systems which avoids the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , here is a severe problem . _ the three popular ensembles , the micro - canonical , the canonical , and the grand - canonical ensembles are not equivalent for `` small '' systems . _ the energy _ per particle _ can fluctuate around its mean value @xmath55 in the ( grand-)canonical ensemble whereas the energy fluctuations are zero in the micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "moreover , the heat capacity is strictly positive in the canonical ensembles whereas it may become _ negative _ in the micro ensemble .",
    "it was gibbs himself who warned for the use of the canonical ensemble at phase transitions of first order @xcite . in this situation",
    "it is certainly advisable to keep close contact with mechanics .",
    "it is helpful to realize that the fundamental micro - canonical ensemble as introduced by boltzmann is the only one which has a clear mechanical definition @xcite for finite systems .    to extend the definition of phase transitions by yang and lee to finite systems we study",
    "which feature of the micro - canonical partition sum @xmath56 leads to singularities of the grand - canonical potentials @xmath53 $ ] as function of @xmath48 by the laplace transform eq.([grandsum ] ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "@xmath57 this integral can be evaluated by asymptotic methods .",
    "as far as the entropy surface @xmath24 has everywhere negative curvatures the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ grandsum ] ) has a single maximum . for large @xmath30 the laplace integral ( r.h.s of eq.([grandsum ] ) )",
    "is then dominated by the contribution of this peak .",
    "this is a _ stationary _",
    "point \\{@xmath58,@xmath59 } where @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "if there is only a single stationary point then there is a one to one mapping of the grand - canonical ensemble to the micro - canonical one and energy - fluctuations disappear .",
    "this , however , is not the case at phase transitions of first order . here",
    "the grand - canonical ensemble contains several gibbs states ( stationary points ) at the same temperature and chemical potential which contribute similarly to the integral ( [ grandsum ] ) .",
    "consequently , the statistical fluctuations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 do not disappear in the grand - canonical ensemble even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is the reason why gibbs himself excluded phase separations @xcite . between the stationary points _",
    "@xmath24 has at least one principal curvature @xmath62_. here van hove s concavity condition @xcite for the entropy @xmath24 is violated . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "these points get jumped over by the integral ( [ grandsum ] ) and @xmath63 $ ] becomes non - analytic .",
    "consequently , we _ define phase transitions also for finite systems topologically by the points and regions of non - negative curvature of the entropy surface @xmath24 as a function of the mechanical , conserved `` extensive '' quantities like energy , mass , angular momentum etc._.    the central quantity of our further discussion the determinant of the curvatures of @xmath24 is defined as @xmath64    also critical fluctuations , i.e. abnormally large fluctuations of some extensive variable in the grand - canonical ensemble or the eventual divergence of some susceptibilities are micro - canonically connected to the vanishing of the curvature determinant , e.g. in the following examples of @xmath28 or @xmath65 respectively : @xmath66 in the case of a classical continuous system @xmath24 is everywhere finite and multiply differentiable . in that case",
    "the inverse susceptibilities @xmath67^{-1}$ ] and @xmath68^{-1}$ ] are well behaved smooth functions of their arguments even at phase transitions .",
    "problems arise only if the susceptibilities are considered as functions of the `` intensive '' variables @xmath32 , and @xmath69 or @xmath70 @xcite . in the case of lattice systems we can only assume that the inverse susceptibilities are similarly well behaved .",
    "this will be further illuminated in the section [ lostinfo ] .",
    "experimentally one identifies phase transitions of first order of course not by the non - analyticities of @xmath53 $ ] but by the interfaces separating coexisting phases , e.g. liquid and gas , i.e. by the _",
    "inhomogeneities _ of the system which become suppressed in the thermodynamic limit in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "this fact was early realized by gibbs @xcite and he emphasized that using @xmath31 vs. volume at phase separation `` has a substantial advantage over any other method because it shows the region of simultaneous coexistence of the vapor , liquid , and solid phases of a substance , a region which reduces to a point in the more usual pressure - temperature plane . ''",
    "that is also the reason why for the grand - canonical ensemble the more mathematical definition of phase transitions @xcite is needed .",
    "the main advantage of the micro - canonical ensemble is that it allows for _ inhomogeneities _ as well and we can keep much closer to the experimental criteria .    interfaces",
    "have three opposing effects on the entropy :    * an entropic _ gain _ by putting a part ( @xmath71 ) of the system from the majority phase ( e.g. solid ) into the minority phase ( bubbles , e.g. gas ) with a higher entropy per particle . however , this has to be paid by additional energy @xmath72 to break the bonds in the `` gas''-phase . as both effects are proportional to the number of particles @xmath71 being converted , this part of the entropy rises linearly with the additional energy .",
    "* with rising size of the bubbles their surfaces grow .",
    "this is connected to an entropic _ loss _ ( surface entropy ) proportional to the interface area due to additional correlations between the particles at the interface . as",
    "the number of surface atoms is @xmath73 this is not linear in @xmath72 and leads to a convex intruder in @xmath16 , the origin of surface tension @xcite.[surf ] * an additional mixing entropy for distributing the @xmath71-particles in various ways over the bubbles .    at a ( multi- )",
    "critical point two ( or more ) phases become indistinguishable because the interface entropy ( surface tension ) disappears .",
    "in this paper we want to discuss how critical and also multi - critical points manifest themselves in the micro - canonical statistics of a finite diluted potts model .",
    "it is helpful first to remind the main physical effects to be expected : we start with the well known properties of the ising model ( written here as a potts model with @xmath74 @xcite ) .",

    "this region of phase separation is darkly shaded in fig.[ising ] and is inaccessible to the grand - canonical ensemble .    the following gedanken - experiment",
    "may illuminate why this region can not be accessed in the grand - canonical ensemble : suppose one prepares the system at a sharp energy and magnetization in the region with positive curvature .",
    "then one puts the system into a heat bath with temperature @xmath92 and magnetization ( particle - number in the case of the diluted potts model ) bath with @xmath93 where it will be suddenly exposed to energy- and magnetization- ( particle number ) fluctuations of arbitrary size . because of the positive curvature of its entropy the system is unstable and will receive or loose sufficient energy to convert _ entirely _ into the gas or _ entirely _ into the solid phase where its free energg is lower .",

    "this is of course a trivial conclusion : an additional constraint like an artificial cut of the system can only reduce phase space and entropy .",
    "the second law is automatically satisfied in the boltzmann formalism whether @xmath31 is concave or not , whether @xmath31 is `` extensive '' or not .",
    "a positive ( wrong ) curvature introduces problems to the geometrical interpretation of thermodynamics as formulated by weinhold @xcite which relies on the non - convexity of @xmath2 .",

    "micro - canonical thermo - statistics describes how the entropy @xmath24 as defined entirely in mechanical terms by boltzmann depends on the conserved `` extensive '' variables : energy @xmath25 , particle number @xmath26 , angular momentum @xmath222 etc .",
    "it is well defined for finite systems without invoking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus in contrast to the conventional theory , we can study phase transitions also in `` small '' systems or other non - extensive systems . in this simulation",
    "we could classify phase transitions in a `` small '' system by the topological properties of the determinant of curvatures @xmath28 , eq.([curvdet ] ) of the micro - canonical entropy - surface @xmath24 :    * a single stable phase by @xmath223 . * a transition of first order with phase separation by @xmath224 .",

    "* finally a multi - critical point @xmath10 where more than two phases become indistinguishable by the branching of several lines with @xmath227 or with @xmath225 to give a _ flat _ region with additionally @xmath228 .",
    "our classification of phase transitions by the topological structure of the micro - canonical boltzmann entropy @xmath24 is close to the natural experimental way to identify phase transitions of first order by the inhomogeneities of phase separation boundaries .",
    "this is possible because the micro - canonical ensemble does not suppress inhomogeneities in contrast to the grand - canonical one , as was emphasized already by gibbs @xcite .",
    "intra - phase boundaries are reflected in `` small '' systems by the convex intruder in the entropy surface .",
    "with this extension of the definition of phase transitions to `` small '' systems there are remarkable similarities with the transitions of the bulk . moreover",
    ", this definition agrees with the conventional definition in the thermodynamic limit ( of course , in the thermodynamic limit the largest curvature @xmath15 approaches @xmath226 from above at phase transitions of first order ) .",
    "the region of phase separation remains inaccessible in the conventional grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we believe , however , that the various kind of transitions discussed here have their immediate meaning in `` small '' and non - extensive systems independently whether they are the same in the thermodynamic limit ( if this then exist ) or not . for systems like the potts model that have a thermodynamic limit it might well be possible that the character of the transition changes towards larger system size .    the great conceptual clarity of micro - canonical thermo - statistics compared to the grand - canonical one",
    "is clearly demonstrated . not only that",
    ", we showed that the micro - canonical statistics gives more information about the thermodynamic behaviour and more insight into the mechanism of phase transitions than the canonical ensemble : about half of the whole \\{e , n } space , the intruder of @xmath2 or the region between the ground state and the line @xmath147 in figure ( [ det ] ) , gets lost in conventional grand - canonical thermodynamics . without any doubts this contains the most sophisticated physics of this system .",
    "we emphasized this point already in @xcite there , however , with still limited precision .",
    "due to our refined simulation method this could be demonstrated here with uniformly good precision in the whole \\{@xmath6 } plane .",
    "finally , we should mention that micro - canonical thermo - statistics allowed us to compute phase transitions and especially the surface tension in realistic systems like small metal clusters @xcite .",
    "our finding clearly disproves the pessimistic judgement by schrdinger @xcite who thought that boltzmann s entropy is only usefull for gases .",
