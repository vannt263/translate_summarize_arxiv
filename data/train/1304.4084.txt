    "<S> by contrast , @xmath47 is finite and one can prove that it is a real number . </S>",
    "<S> similar considerations can be used to calculate all matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in the basis of @xmath35 the @xmath48 hamiltonian at the @xmath2 point is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the matrix elements of @xmath41 in the above mentioned basis and @xmath51 are band - edge energies . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](b ) and ( c ) , whereas @xmath60 is responsible for the tw of the energy contours . the cubic term , @xmath62 is important to achieve a quantitative fit to the vb away from the @xmath2 point . </S>",
    "<S> we note that symmetries allow for another , diagonal hamiltonian which is @xmath63 , but its effect has been found to be negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> we used the vasp code@xcite and the local density approximation ( lda ) of dft to calculate@xcite the band structure and isoenergy contours shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . to compare our @xmath19 theory with the dft calculations one has to determine the matrix elements @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements , in principle , can also be calculated from dft@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found however , that the isoenergy lines calculated with parameters @xmath64 obtained from the numerical evaluation of @xmath65 using kohn - sham orbitals@xcite give a satisfactory agreement with dft band structure only in the close vicinity of the @xmath2 point . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we used these @xmath64 values as a starting point for a fitting procedure whereby we fitted the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) [ given in terms of @xmath66 , @xmath61 and the band edge energies @xmath67 , and @xmath68 along the @xmath69 line to the cb and vb obtained from the dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the fit involved a range of @xmath70 in the @xmath15 and @xmath71 directions . from the fitting we found the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> the isoenergy contours calculated using these parameters [ the solid lines in figs .  [ fig1](b ) and ( c ) ] capture well the tw of the band dispersion ( c.f the results of the dft computations given by symbols ) , which is more pronounced in the vb than in the cb . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the dft results and the predictions based on ( [ h_eff ] ) is very good up to energies @xmath75 below the vb maximum and above the cb minimum ; for other energies the agreement is qualitative . </S>",
    "<S> the effective masses ( along the @xmath76 line ) that can be inferred from these parameters are @xmath77 for the vb and @xmath78 for the cb , which are in good agreement with the results of other dft lda calculations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a similar set of parameters based on band structure calculations using the hse06 hybrid functional , see appendix [ hse - bandparam ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we have checked by numerical calculations that although the tw is quite strong in the vb , its effect on the landau levels is actually very small , and they can be calculated by neglecting @xmath79 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h_eff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , @xmath79 and @xmath62 should affect the berry - curvature and hence various hall - conductivities@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of the band structure of @xmath1 which has received little attention so far is that the top of the valence band at the @xmath15 point is very close in energy to the vbm at the @xmath2 point@xcite ; see also fig.[fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for the vb transport properties the states close to the @xmath15 point can also be important . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of this `` @xmath15-valley '' can also be derived using the @xmath19 theory , along similar lines to the case of the @xmath2 point . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the group of the wave vector at the @xmath15 point is @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> our dft calculations show that here the vb is mainly composed of the @xmath3 and @xmath81 orbitals of the mo atoms and the @xmath82 orbitals of the s atoms , which means that it belongs to the @xmath83 irrep of @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the vb is coupled to the vb-3 and cb+1 bands which are doubly degenerate at the @xmath15 point . </S>",
    "<S> there is no coupling between the vb and the cb at the @xmath15 point : due to band crossings along the @xmath84 line the cb becomes antisymmetric with respect to @xmath22 . upon performing the lwdin partitioning we find that the dispersion is isotropic and can be well described by @xmath85 , where the effective mass @xmath86 is found by fitting the band structure , which is in good agreement with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the importance and role of the @xmath15 point in the transport properties of the vb would require further experimental work . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that in disordered samples due to their large effective mass and hence low mobility the contribution of these states to the transport is small , but they may be important in ballistic samples and in quantum - hall measurements .    the description of the system becomes more complicated if one takes into account the soc as well . in the atomic approximation </S>",
    "<S> the soc is given by the hamiltonian @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the spherically symmetric atomic potential , @xmath89 is the angular momentum operator and @xmath90 is a vector of spin pauli matrices @xmath91 ( with eigenvalues @xmath92 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the spinful symmetry basis functions by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denotes the spin degree of freedom , and consider first the @xmath2 point of the bz . since @xmath98 transforms as the @xmath99 irrep of @xmath24 , there can be non - vanishing matrix elements of @xmath100 between states that are even / odd with respect to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we considered a seven - band model ( without spin ) which contains every band between vb-3 and cb+2 , i.e. , we consider the basis @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetries @xmath22 and @xmath21 of the system here also help us to find the non - zero matrix elements of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one can make use of the fact that @xmath102 and therefore show that @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant , whereas @xmath105 . by calculating the matrix @xmath106 in the above mentioned basis and diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a diagonal matrix containing the band - edge energies , one obtains the eigenstates @xmath109 , which in general turn out to be linear combinations of a symmetric @xmath110 and an antisymmetric @xmath111 wavefunction with different weights . in our notation the new eigenstates @xmath109 inherit the band index @xmath27 and spin index @xmath81 from the state whose weight is larger in the linear combination that makes up @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> this assignment of the band index and spin quantum number is possible because the typical energy scale of the soc ( the upper limit of which is the splitting of the valence band @xmath112 , see below ) is significantly smaller than the typical band separation , i.e. , the bands are not strongly hybridized by the soc . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalization of the hamiltonian can be done analytically in the approximation that couplings of up to next - nearest - neighbour bands are kept and more remote couplings , e.g. , between @xmath113 and @xmath114 are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> all eigenstates are non - degenerate , as expected , since the double group of @xmath24 has only one - dimensional representations . </S>",
    "<S> with the new eigenstates @xmath109 one can repeat the @xmath19 calculation , and since @xmath115 is an admixture of symmetric and antisymmetric states , there will be more non - zero matrix elements of the @xmath116 hamiltonian than there were in the case of zero spin - orbit coupling ; see eq.([hkpk ] ) . finally , using the lwdin partitioning we can derive an effective low - energy hamiltonian for the spinful valence and conduction bands . since the calculations are quite lengthy , we only give the most important results here and concentrate on the zero - magnetic field case . the landau - level problem in the presence of soc and the related question of the effective @xmath117-factor of monolayer </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 will be discussed elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> we will work in the basis of @xmath118 independent part of the soc hamiltonian , i.e. , we consider the soc dependence of the band edge energies . according to our @xmath119 calculations , the spin - splitting in the vb and the cb can be described by the hamiltonians    @xmath120 \\label{so - cb}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the term @xmath121 was first obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , whereas the second term of @xmath122 , which is expected to be much smaller , comes from the coupling of spin - up ( spin - down ) band of vb to vb-1 at the @xmath2 ( @xmath11 ) point . </S>",
    "<S> ( the coupling of the spin - down ( spin - up ) band of the vb to other bands is much weaker . ) </S>",
    "<S> our dft calculations give a spin - orbit gap of @xmath123 in the vb . </S>",
    "<S> the spin splitting of the cb , given by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> , has not yet been discussed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> it originates from the soc of the cb to the vb-1 and cb+1 bands and is a consequence of the hitherto neglected off - diagonal soc terms , related to the @xmath124 part of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> our results therefore show that the spin - valley coupling is present not only in the vb@xcite but also in the cb . </S>",
