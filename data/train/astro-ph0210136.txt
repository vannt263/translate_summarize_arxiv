    "the existence of the supercluster - void network is one of the most intriguing observational features of our universe .",
    "redshift surveys of galaxies confirm that on very large scales the bulk of matter in the universe is concentrated in clusters and superclusters of galaxies which are separated by large almost empty regions , appropriately called voids . at moderate density thresholds @xmath5 , the supercluster network percolates even though it occupies a tiny fraction of the total volume , and so has a small filling fraction .",
    "the morphology of the supercluster - void network is quite complex and has inspired evocative descriptions such as being ` honey - comb - like ' , ` bubble - like ' , ` a filamentary network ' , ` swiss cheese ' , ` cosmic web ' etc . indeed",
    "the intricate weave of large scale structure is becoming increasingly evident as results from progressively larger galaxy redshift surveys ( cfa , iras , pscz , lcrs , 2dfgrs , sdss ) demonstrate . quantifying the properties of the supercluster - void network",
    "is clearly one of the cardinal tasks facing cosmology today . since the network evolved from an almost featureless gaussian random field ( as suggested by observations of the cosmic microwave background )",
    "it is important to understand how such a rich and complex cosmic tapestry  characterized by prominent non - gaussian features ( clusters , superclusters , voids )  could have arisen from small and statistically random initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , since the network is highly evolved it is unlikely that its principle features can be described within a strictly perturbative framework which breaks down when @xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore both interesting and revealing that approximations which successfully describe non - linear dynamics ( such as the zeldovich approximation and the adhesion model ) generically predict the formation of filaments and pancakes , which interweave and percolate to form the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this interweaving network of filaments , sheets and voids  predicted both by the zeldovich approximation and the adhesion model  is readily seen in n - body simulations of gravitational clustering for a wide variety of initial power spectra @xcite .",
    "it therefore appears that a filamentary distribution of large scale structure is an almost generic outcome of pressureless ( dark ) matter clustering from gaussian initial conditions .",
    "( a theoretical model for understanding the morphology of large scale structure can be found in the `` cosmic web '' hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "insightful overviews of the statistical and dynamical techniques used in studies of large scale structure can be found in : @xcite . )",
    "a number of statistical measures have been advanced to quantify the pattern made by galaxies as they cluster in our universe .",
    "prominent among them are percolation analysis @xcite , counts in cells @xcite , minimal spanning trees @xcite , the genus measure @xcite etc .",
    "( to some extent these methods complement the traditional approach to quantify clustering using the hierarchy of correlation functions @xcite , which become cumbersome to evaluate beyond the three point function . )",
    "recently mecke , buchert and wagner ( 1994 ) have introduced the minkowski functionals ( hereafter mfs ) to cosmology .",
    "mfs contain information pertaining to geometry , connectivity ( percolation ) and topology ( genus ) .",
    "in addition , the ratio s of minkowski functionals quantify the _ morphology _ of large scale structure .",
    "this has led to the construction of a set of measures called shapefinders which tell us whether the distribution of matter in superclusters / voids is spherical , planar , filamentary etc . @xcite .",
    "( applications of shapefinders to galaxy catalogues and n - body simulations has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "moment - based studies of morphology predating the shapefinders can be found in @xcite . ) thus between them , the four minkowski functionals contain valuable information regarding both the geometrical as well as topological distribution of matter in the universe . since",
    "minkowski functionals are additive in nature one can glean information regarding both individual objects ( galaxies , clusters , voids ) as well as describe the supercluster - void network in its totality",
    ".    there have been three major attempts made to study the morphology of the lss using mfs ; these efforts differ in their approach of evaluating the mfs : ( 1 ) firstly , boolean grain models study the mfs of surfaces which result due to intersecting spheres decorating the input point - set ( mecke , buchert @xmath7 wagner 1994 ) .",
    "( 2 ) secondly , krofton s formulae make it possible to calculate mfs on a density field defined on a grid ( schmalzing @xmath7 buchert 1997 ) . in this case",
    "the mfs are calculated by using the information of the number of cells in 1d ( vertices ) , 2d ( faces ) and 3d ( cuboids ) .",
    "( 3 ) finally , an alternative , resolution - dependent approach consists in employing the koenderink invariants ( schmalzing @xmath7 buchert 1997 , schmalzing et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "this paper introduces a radically new and powerful approach for computing the minkowski functionals .",
    "this approach consists of constructing iso - density surfaces using an elaborate surface modelling scheme defined in terms of excursion sets of a density field .",
    "these surfaces are triangulated and the mfs are evaluated for the resulting closed polyhedral surface . a similar algorithm has been used in studies of two - dimensional cmb maps @xcite .",
    "however , developing a three - dimensional algorithm requires a new component that builds a surface of approximately constant ( to linear order ) density .",
    "it has been implemented and reported in this paper .",
    "the mfs so constructed are tested against known results for simply connected surfaces ( triaxial ellipsoids ) as well as multiply connected surfaces ( triaxial tori ) . in all cases",
    "we find that our ansatz for determining mfs on polyhedra gives results which are _ in excellent agreement _ with exact continuum values for these quantities .",
    "we have further tested the performance of surfgen against gaussian random fields for which the analytic prediction for mfs is available and find that our calculations reproduce the analytic results to a remarkable precision .",
    "this gives us confidence that our ansatz is well suited for application to large n - body simulations and three - dimensional galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "encouraged by the success on these preliminary tests , we apply our method to simulations of three cosmological models due to the virgo consortium .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows : in section 2 , we provide a brief overview of minkowski functionals and present an algorithm which computes mfs for a triangulated polyhedral surface . in section 3",
    ", we describe the surfgen algorithm which triangulates a general class of surfaces including iso - density surfaces describing superclusters or voids . in section 4",
    "we test our method against standard eikonal surfaces @xmath8 spheres , ellipsoids , tori @xmath8 and demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm .",
    "special boundary conditions are needed to reproduce the analytic expressions for mfs of a gaussian random field .",
    "the related discussion along with the results for gaussian random fields is presented at the end of the paper in an appendix .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a detailed morphological study of cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "the models investigated are @xmath1cdm , @xmath2cdm and scdm at the present cosmological epoch .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 6 which also discusses possible further applications of surfgen and the mfs .",
    "the large scale structure of the universe can be studied on various scales by considering the geometry and topology of excursion sets of the density contrast @xmath9 defined as @xmath10 , for overdense regions ( clusters , superclusters ) and @xmath11 , for underdense regions ( voids ) . by specifying",

    "below we describe how one can determine the minkowski functionals ( and derived quantities ) for surfaces derived from real data by interpolation .",
    "the interpolation scheme which describes iso - density contours as triangulated surfaces will be presented in detail in the next section .",
    "we construct a polyhedral surface using an assembly of triangles in which every triangle shares its sides with each of its three neighboring triangles .",

    "as demonstrated in @xcite ratio s of minkowski functionals called `` shapefinders '' provide us with an excellent measure of morphology .",

    "having presented an ansatz to calculate mfs and shapefinders on a triangulated surface , we now discuss the _ surface generating _ algorithm ( surfgen ) which creates triangulated surfaces corresponding to iso - density contours evaluated at any desired threshold of the density field .",
    "surfgen is a versatile and powerful prescription which allows us to generate and study surfaces whose physical origin can be quite varied and different .",
    "intensity surfaces ( isophotes ) , isotherms and iso - density surfaces constructed from 3d data provide examples of two dimensional surfaces which can be generated and studied using surfgen and the minkowski functionals discussed in the previous section .",
    "the present paper is the first of a series in which surfgen and mfs will be used in conjunction to make a detailed morphological study of the supercluster - void network in the universe .",
    "surfgen will be applied to a density field @xmath56 defined on a rectangular cubic lattice .",
    "the surfgen algorithm is constructed as follows :    1 .",
    "a point particle distribution ( from n - body simulations , galaxy catalogues ) is used to reconstruct the density field on the vertices of a cubic lattice via a cloud - in - cell ( cic ) approach .",
    "the lattice itself consists of a large number of closely packed elementary cubes .",
    "any given cube is characterized by the value of the density at its eight vertices .",
    "an appropriate density threshold @xmath57 is chosen and lattice points at this threshold are found using linear interpolation . the lattice - cells which involve such interpolated points along their sides are marked for triangulation which is to be done in the next step .",
    "3 .   surfgen determines a closed polyhedral surface at the threshold @xmath58 by _ triangulating elementary cubes _ while simultaneously moving across the lattice .",
    "triangulated elementary cubes are then put together to make up the full two - dimensional triangulated surface .",
    "the process of triangulation is based on the following observation .    for any arbitrary threshold of the density ,",
    "all elementary cubes of the density field fall into one of the following three classes :        \\(i ) those which have all eight vertices below the density threshold ( _ underdense cubes _  fig .",
    "[ fig : threetypes]@xmath8i ) ,    \\(ii ) those which have all eight vertices above the density threshold ( _ overdense cubes _  fig .",
    "[ fig : threetypes]@xmath8ii ) ,    \\(iii ) cubes having both overdense and underdense vertices ( _ surface cubes _  fig .",
    "[ fig : threetypes]@xmath8iii ) .    when modelling clusters and superclusters overdense cubes will be _ enclosed _ by our surface while underdense cubes will be excluded by it .",
    "( for voids the situation will be reversed . )",
    "contour surfaces at a prespecified density threshold will _ lie entirely within surface cubes_. thus the properties of _ surface cubes _ are vitally important for this surface - reconstruction exercise .",
    "we now describe how surfgen constructs a surface at the desired threshold @xmath58 by triangulating _",
    "surface cubes_. we work under the assumption that the underlying density field @xmath59 is continuous , so that in moving from an overdense site to an underdense site ( along a cube edge ) we invariably encounter a point at which @xmath60 .",
    "surfgen classifies a given lattice - cube in terms of the number of points ( on the edges ) where @xmath60 .",
    "the precise location of these points ( found by interpolation ) tells us exactly where our iso - density surface will intersect the cube .",
    "since there are eight vertices and each vertex can either be overdense ( 1 ) or underdense ( 0 ) , the number of possible configurations of the cube are @xmath61 .",
    "clearly the triangulation must be invariant upon interchanging 1 s with 0 s , and this reduces the number of independent configurations to 128 . upon invoking rotational symmetry",
    "this number further reduces to only 14 .",
    "( for instance , although there are eight cubes which have a single overdense vertex , any two members of this family are related via the three dimensional rotation group .",
    "therefore a single scheme of triangulation suffices to describe all members of this group . )",
    "these fourteen configurations of triangulated cubes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mca ] ( also see @xcite ) .    the surface intersecting a given _ surface cube _ forms quite clearly only a portion of the full iso - density surface which we are interested in constructing . by explicitly demanding that the density field be _ continuous _ across the iso - density surface one joins triangles across the faces of neighboring cubes , thus constructing the full continuous polyhedral surface .",
    "this then is the basic prescription which may be used to construct a closed triangulated surface at any desired value of the density threshold .",
    "however , a few comments about triangulation are in order :    \\(i ) the triangulation of the cubes having four contrasting vertices is _ not unique_. to illustrate this let us consider fig .",
    "[ fig : degen ] where the last cube belonging to the middle row of fig .",
    "[ fig : mca ] is reproduced in the left panel .",
    "we note that this cube is symmetric with respect to an interchange of underdense sites with overdense sites . as a result , we could just as well triangulate it according to the prescription shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : degen ] .",
    "this degeneracy in the way a given cube can be triangulated is inherent also in the last two cubes of the last row of fig .",
    "[ fig : mca ] .",
    "noticeably , at all such places where we encounter one of these cubes , one scheme of triangulation has to be preferred over the other , otherwise the surface could become discontinuous . thus to create a unique triangulated surface one must triangulate such cubes _ in tandem _ with their neighbors , ensuring that the continuity of the surface is maintained .",
    "\\(ii ) there are instances when two neighboring cubes have a density configuration which does not lead to the complete closure of the given surface .",
    "the resulting surface has a hole ( fig .  [",
    "fig : holeform]a ) which must be filled by constructing two additional triangles which close the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : holeform]b ) .",
    "the probability of hole formation is finite every time the common face shared by two cubes shows two vertices of type 1 along one diagonal and of type 0 along the other diagonal .",
    "thus , in order to generate a closed polyhedral surface at a given value of the density threshold @xmath60 surfgen uses the 14 independent triangulations of an elementary lattice cube in conjunction with an algorithm which ensures that the surface is continuous . we should emphasize that surfaces generated in this manner _ need not be simply connected _",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vsc ] ) . indeed iso - density surfaces constructed at moderate density thresholds in n - body simulations as well as 3d galaxy surveys tend to show a large positive value for the genus ( eq.[eq : genus ] ) .",
    "this issue will be discussed in detail in forthcoming paper(s ) . to enable an online calculation of the mfs",
    ", our surface modelling scheme also adheres to the following requirements :    * the vertices of all the triangles are stored in an anticlockwise order .",
    "this enforces a uniform prescription on normals which always point outward from the surface being modelled .",
    "information regarding the directionality of normals is of great importance since it is used both for calculating the volume as well as the mean curvature . * for online calculation of the mean curvature ,",
    "information concerning a given triangle must be supplemented with information concerning the triplet of triangles which are its neighbors .",
    "this allows us to unambiguously determine the contribution to the mean curvature from a local neighborhood .",
    "* the total number of triangles , triangle - edges and triangle - vertices of a triangulated surface are counted which enable us to determine its genus when surface construction is complete .",
    "we might add that , although in this paper the density field is reconstructed from n - body particle positions by means of a cic prescription , this is not a necessary prerequisite for surfgen which is versatile enough to be used to triangulate iso - density contours of fields reconstructed using more elaborate techniques such as delauney tesselations @xcite , wiener reconstruction or adaptive smoothing . as it turns out ,",
    "these schemes tend to maintain the structural complexity in the system without diluting the patterns in an isotropic manner .",
    "however , since surfgen constructs a triangulated surface by ` marching across neighboring lattice cubes ' @xcite the density field must be specified on a cubic lattice for this approach to give meaningful results . for determining the minkowski functionals for a triangulated surface",
    "can easily be adapted to other triangulation schemes such as those described in @xcite . ]    to summarize , our surface modelling code incorporates the triangulation of the entire set of 256 possible configurations of a cube within a single scheme and makes possible online computation of the area , the volume , the integrated mean curvature and the genus of a triangulated surface .",
    "the code has been tested on a variety of standard density distributions and eikonal morphologies as well as on gaussian random fields .",
    "in the next section , we present results based on this analysis .",
    "in order to test the accuracy of our ansatz we generate triangulated surfaces whose counterpart continuum surfaces have known ( analytically calculable ) minkowski functionals .      in the first exercise ,",
    "we consider spherically symmetric density distributions and generate surfaces of constant density for a variety of density - thresholds starting from a chosen maximum radius down to grid - size .",
    "a convenient density distribution for this exercise is [ eq : sphden ] ( i , j , k ) = \\ {    ll , & ( i , j , k ) ( i_0 , j_0 , k_0 ) , + _ 0 , & ( i , j , k ) = ( i_0 , j_0 , k_0 ) ,    . where r is the distance between ( i , j , k ) and the centre .",
    "[ eq : sphdist ] r = .",
    "since the density field falls off as the inverse of the distance from the centre at ( @xmath62 ) , any threshold @xmath58 is associated with a sphere of radius @xmath63 .",
    "thus larger spheres correspond to surfaces of lower constant density in this model .",
    "we assume @xmath64 , for the centre of the sphere in our numerical calculations .    applying the shapefinders ( [ eq : s123 ] ) & ( [ eq : shapefinder ] ) to a sphere of radius @xmath65",
    "one finds the simple result @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sph - results ] compares the area , volume , mean curvature and shapefinders measured for a triangulated sphere against known analytical values for these quantities .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that exact values , and values computed using triangulation , match exceedingly well down to the very lowest scale .",
    "we should mention that the genus evaluated using eq.[eq : genus ] is identically zero for spheres of all radii and for all possible deformations of an ellipsoid ( to be discussed next ) .",
    "this provides an excellent independent endorsement of our methodology by demonstrating that our triangulations of a sphere and ellipsoid indeed result in closed , continuous surfaces .",
    "a triaxial ellipsoid is an excellent shape with which to test a morphological statistic .",
    "this is because , depending upon the relative scales of the three axes , a triaxial ellipsoid can be oblate , prolate or spherical .",
    "we saw previously that mfs and shapefinders give extremely accurate results for spherical surfaces .",
    "we now demonstrate that this remains true even for surfaces which are highly planar or filamentary .",
    "the parametric form of an ellipsoid having axes @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 and volume @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 . for the purposes of our study , we systematically deform a triaxial ellipsoid and study how its shape evolves in the process .",
    "when shrunk along a single axis a triaxial ellipsoid becomes planar .",
    "simultaneous shrinking along a second axis makes it cigar - like or filamentary .",
    "we first study the accuracy of our triangulation scheme for planar configurations by considering oblate deformations of an ellipsoid . in this case",
    "two axes @xmath75 and @xmath76 are held fixed ( @xmath77 ) , while the third axis @xmath70 is slowly shrunk leading to an increasingly planar surface .",
    "our results for this case are compiled in two figures .",
    "figure  [ fig : planmf ] shows mfs as they evolve with the dimensionless variable @xmath78 .",
    "( the exact results for the minkowski functionals which we quote are based on the analytical expressions for mfs given in @xcite , we refer the reader to that paper for more details . ) figure  [ fig : planmf ] clearly demonstrates that the values of mfs obtained using triangulation match the exact values to a remarkable degree of accuracy .",
    "indeed , for a wide range in @xmath78 the two distinctly different calculational algorithms give virtually indistinguishable results , thereby indicating that the triangulation ansatz is , for all practical purposes , exact !",
    "figure  [ fig : plans123 ] shows the evolution of all the shapefinders , i.e. , @xmath79 and @xmath49 together with the percentage errors in the estimation of dimensional shapefinders .",
    "we find that @xmath46 is estimated to greatest accuracy with maximum error of @xmath80 , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be determined to an accuracy of @xmath81 .",
    "we further note ( right panels of figure  [ fig : plans123 ] ) that planarity grows from an initially low value @xmath82 to a large final value @xmath83 as the ellipsoid becomes increasingly oblate .",
    "filamentarity , on the other hand remains small at @xmath84 .",
    "both filamentarity and planarity are determined to great accuracy by surfgen .",
    "next we study prolate deformations of our oblate ellipsoid .",
    "we start with @xmath85 @xmath86 and shrink the second axis @xmath76 while keeping @xmath75 and @xmath70 fixed , so that finally @xmath87 and our initially oblate ellipsoid becomes prolate .",
    "our results are again summarized in two figures .",
    "figure  [ fig : flmf ] reveals very good agreement between measured and true values of mfs , with the former tending to be slightly smaller than the latter .",
    "turning to the shapefinders we find that , with the possible exception of extremely prolate figures , the shapefinders are remarkably well determined .",
    "indeed , even the extremely prolate ellipsoid with axis ratio @xmath88 has a largest error in @xmath44 of only @xmath89 while errors in @xmath45 and @xmath46 never exceed @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fls123 ] ) .",
    "this figure also shows the evolution of planarity ( @xmath48 ) and filamentarity ( @xmath49 ) as our ellipsoid becomes increasingly more prolate . in keeping with our expectation",
    "@xmath49 steadily increases from a small initial value @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "planarity drops from its large initial value to a small final value @xmath93 and is slightly underestimated for @xmath94 .",
    "we therefore conclude that both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are determined by surfgen to a sufficient accuracy for prolate ellipsoidal figures .",
    "next we extend our analysis to manifolds which are multiply connected by considering the deformations of a torus which has an elliptical cross section and which we shall refer to as an elliptical torus .",
    "a torus is an important surface on which to test surfgen for two reasons : it is multiply connected and , unlike an ellipsoid , it contains regions which are convex ( on its outside ) as well as concave ( on its inside ) .",
    "the elliptical torus can be described by three parameters @xmath95 . in this case",
    "the elliptical toroidal tube has diameter @xmath96 and @xmath75 & @xmath70 are its radii of curvature in two mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "the elliptical torus reduces to the more familiar circular torus when @xmath97 .",
    "we choose to work with the elliptical torus because changing the values of @xmath95 can give rise to a large variety of surfaces all of which ( by definition ) are multiply connected but which have very different shapes .",
    "thus our surface modelling scheme surfgen can be put to a rigorous test .",
    "the parametric form for the elliptic torus is = ( b + c ) + ( b + c ) + a , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "although the curves may look similar , some of them are statistically very different from their peers .",
    "the first four columns of table [ tab : ks ] show the results of the kolmogorov - smirnov test applied to the distribution of the mfs .",
    "( we do not carry out a similar exercise for the genus since the vast majority of clusters at the ncs threshold are simply connected . ) in particular the cpf of the masses clearly distinguish the @xmath103cdm model from scdm & @xmath2cdm , in agreement with fig .",

    "for all three pairs they are among three best discriminators of the models .",
    "the value of ks statistic @xmath104 suggests that the signal comes from relatively small values of p ( @xmath105 ) and f ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the more conspicuous differences in the tail of the distribution is not statistically significant due to poor statistics .",
    "clusters in @xmath103cdm are the least anisotropic , a fact which corresponds to their relatively early formation and therefore longer evolution . from figure",

    "the mass - dependence of morphology is highlighted in this panel in which larger dots denote more massive objects .",
    "this figure clearly reveals that more massive clusters / superclusters are , as a rule , also more filamentary , while smaller , less massive objects , are more nearly spherical .",
    "the concentration of points near the ` edge ' of the scatter plot in the right panel , arises due to an abundance of low mass compact quasi - spherical objects with @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the large number of massive superclusters with @xmath114 serves to highlight the important fact that the larger and more massive elements of the supercluster chain consist of highly elongated filaments as much as @xmath115h@xmath109 mpc in length , with mean diameter @xmath116h@xmath109 mpc ( see table [ tab : top10s123 ] ) .",
    "it is important to reiterate that almost 40% of the total overdense mass resides in the ten largest objects listed in table [ tab : top10s123 ] , while the remaining 60% is distributed among 1324 clusters .",
    "we also find short filaments to be generally thinner than longer ones in agreement with predictions made by the adhesion model with regard to the formation of hierarchical filamentary structure during gravitational clustering @xcite .    to further probe the morphology of clusters and superclusters we define the notion of shape - space in figure [ fig : shape - space ] .",
    "shape - space is two dimensional with the planarity ( of a cluster ) plotted along the x - axis and its filamentarity along the y - axis .",

    "we note that the most massive structures are also very filamentary . in the right panel",
    "we try to relate the shape of the structures with their topology by scaling the size of the dots with the genus value of clusters having a given morphology ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "as shown here , clusters which are multiply connected ( larger dots are indicative of more complicated topologies ) are also more filamentary . together , the three panels show us that more massive superclusters are frequently very filamentary and often also topologically quite complex .",
    "we also see that a large number of less massive superclusters are simply connected and prolate .",

    "this paper presents a new technique for studying the geometrical and topological properties of large scale structure using the minkowski functionals ( mfs ) .",
    "given a density field reconstructed by appropriately smoothing a point data set consisting ( say ) of a distribution of galaxies , our ansatz : ( i ) constructs closed polyhedral surfaces of constant density corresponding to excursion sets of a density field , using for this purpose a surface generating triangulation scheme ( surfgen ) ; ( ii ) surfgen evaluates the minkowski functionals ( volume , surface area , extrinsic curvature and genus ) thus providing full morphological and topological information of three dimensional iso - density contour surfaces corresponding to a given data set .",
    "evaluated in this manner , the minkowski functionals can be used to study the properties of individual objects lying either above ( clusters , superclusters ) or below ( voids ) a given density threshold .",
    "they can also be used to study the morphological properties of the full supercluster - void network at ( say ) the percolation threshold .",
    "the ratio s of minkowski functionals ( shapefinders ) are used to probe the shape of iso - density surfaces which sample the distribution of large scale structure at different thresholds of the density .",
    "( the highest density thresholds correspond to galaxies and clusters of galaxies , moderate thresholds correspond to superclusters while the lowest density thresholds characterize voids . )",
    "the performance of our ansatz has been tested against both simply and multiply connected surfaces such as the sphere , triaxial ellipsoid and triaxial torus .",
    "these three eikonal bodies can be smoothly deformed to give surfaces which are spheroidal , pancake - like ( oblate ) and filament - like ( prolate ) etc .",
    "analytically known values of the minkowski functionals for these surfaces allow us to test both our surface modelling scheme and our evaluation of minkowski functionals from triangulation .",
    "remarkably , we find that volume , area and integrated extrinsic curvature are determined to an accuracy of better than @xmath120 on all length - scales for both simply and multiply connected surfaces .",
    "the integrated intrinsic curvature ( genus ) is evaluated exactly .",
    "we also find that surfgen is remarkably accurate at calculating the mfs for gaussian random fields ( see the appendix ) .",
    "having validated the performance of the code against eikonal surfaces and gaussian random fields , we apply our method to cosmological simulations of large scale structure performed by the virgo consortium .",
    "we study the geometry and topology of large scale structure in three cosmological scenarios - @xmath1cdm , @xmath2cdm and scdm .",
    "all three cosmologies are analysed at the present epoch ( z=0 ) using global mfs , partial mfs and shapefinders .",
    "( the redshift evolution of geometry and topology will be discussed in a companion paper . )",
    "our main conclusions are summarized below :    * using the minkowski functionals we show that , like other diagnostics of clustering , supercluster morphology too is sensitive to the underlying cosmological parameter set characterizing our universe .",
    "although the three cosmological models considered by us , @xmath1cdm , @xmath2cdm and scdm display features which are qualitatively similar , the geometrical and morphological properties of these models are sufficiently distinct to permit differentiation using mfs . we demonstrate that studying minkowski functionals using mass - parameterization significantly enhances their discriminatory power . * surfgen employs a new contour - based method for determining topology .",
    "this method evaluates the genus for an iso - density contour surface directly , by applying the euler formula eq.([eq : genus ] ) to the triangulated surface , and presents a significant improvement over earlier grid - based methods of determining topology @xcite .",
    "* a study of percolation and cluster abundance reveals several interesting aspects of the gravitational clustering process .",
    "for all models , on decreasing the density threshold to progressively smaller values one reaches the critical percolation threshold at which the largest supercluster runs through ( percolates ) the simulation box .",
    "percolation is reached at moderate values of the density contrast ranging from @xmath121 for @xmath1cdm to @xmath122 for scdm .",
    "the abundance of clusters reaches a maximum value at ( or very near ) the percolation threshold and the percolating supercluster occupies a rather small amount of space in all three cosmological models .",
    "thus the fraction of total simulation - box volume contained in the percolating supercluster is least in @xmath1cdm ( @xmath3 ) and greatest in scdm ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "when taken together , all overdense objects at the percolation threshold occupy @xmath124 of the total volume in the @xmath1cdm model . for comparison",
    ", the volume fraction in overdense regions at the percolation threshold is @xmath125 in an idealised , continuous gaussian random field @xcite .",
    "this fraction can increase upto @xmath126 for gaussian fields generated on a grid @xcite .",
    "the fact that clusters & supercluster occupy a very small fraction of the total volume appears to be a hallmark of the gravitational clustering process which succeeds in placing a large amount of mass ( @xmath126 of the total , in the case of @xmath1cdm ) in a small region of space ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the low filling fraction of the percolating supercluster in @xmath1cdm ( @xmath128 ) strongly suggests that this object is either planar or filamentary @xcite and a definitive answer to this issue is provided by the shapefinder statistic .",
    "* shapefinders were introduced to quantify the visual impression one has of the supercluster - void network of being a cosmic web of filaments interspersed with large voids @xcite . by applying the shapefinder statistics via surfgen to realistic n - body simulations",
    "we have demonstrated that : ( i ) most of the mass in the universe is contained in large superclusters which are also extremely filamentary ; the vast abundance of smaller clusters and superclusters tends to be prolate or quasi - spherical .",
    "( ii ) of the three cosmological models the percolating supercluster in @xmath1cdm is the most filamentary ( @xmath129 ) and the supercluster in @xmath2cdm the least ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "( iii ) the percolating supercluster in @xmath1cdm is topologically a much simpler object than its counterpart in @xmath2cdm , with the former having only @xmath131 tunnels compared to @xmath132 in the latter .",
    "other differences between the models are quantified in figures [ fig : globalff ] @xmath8 [ fig : shape - space ] .",
    "we also show that among various morphological parameters , the planarity and filamentarity of clusters and superclusters is one of the most powerful statistics to discriminate between the models ( see table [ tab : ks ] ) .    to summarize",
    ", this paper has demonstrated that minkowski functionals and shapefinders evaluated using surfgen provide sensitive probes of the geometry , topology and shape of large scale structure and help in distinguishing between rival cosmological models .",
    "having established the strength and versatility of surfgen it would clearly be interesting to apply it to other important issues , related to those addressed in this paper , including : ( i ) geometry and morphology of underdense regions ( voids ) ; ( ii ) geometry and morphology of strongly overdense regions ( clusters ) ; ( iii ) redshift - space distortions of supercluster / void morphology ; ( iv ) the time - evolution of the supercluster - void network ; ( v ) analysis of superclusters and voids in fully three dimensional surveys such as 2dfgrs and sdss ; ( vi ) surfgen is also likely to provide useful insights in other physical and astrophysical situations in which matter is distributed anisotropically such as in the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) .",

    "let us now describe the boundary conditions which we adopt and which incorporate the periodic nature of the grfs generated using a fft routine .",
    "grfs defined on a grid are , by construction , periodic in nature . as a result ,",
    "two overdense excursion sets visibly separated from each other inside the box and touching two opposite sides of the box would constitute a single cluster . to make this more clear ,",
    "let us turn to fig .",
    "[ fig : projection ] which shows four clusters ( labelled 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively ) in the left panel .",
    "the boundaries of these clusters @xmath8 as drawn by an analog of surfgen in 2-d @xmath8 are shown in bold , and we note that the sides of the box ( bold dashed lines ) are incorporated when we define the clusters . however , due to the periodicity in the density field , these four clusters are in fact one single cluster ( right panel ) .",
    "we note that the portion of the contours due to the boundaries of the box occurs in the interior of the actual cluster ( shown with a bold dashed line ) .",
    "it is easy to extrapolate this situation to 3@xmath8d .",
    "note that the interpolation method employed by surfgen will correctly estimate the global volume of the excursion set even if we worked with the field _ as it is_. in 2@xmath8d this is same as estimating the area enclosed by the _ full _ cluster without having to piece the four `` clusters '' ( labelled by 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) together .",
    "our estimation of global genus will also turn out to be exact , and as it can be shown , this will hold true even if either of these four constituent clusters exhibits a nontrivial topology . on the other hand ,",
    "if we work with the same set of contours for estimating global area and mean curvature , we will wrongly be adding an excess contribution due to the sides of the box .",
    "( in 2@xmath8d , this translates to adding the contribution of the dashed line segments to the perimeter of the contour in the right panel of figure [ fig : projection ] ) .",
    "the actual area and mean curvature contribution comes from the interface between overdense and underdense regions ( such as the 2@xmath8d contours drawn in solid bold line in both the panels ) as opposed to the artificial boundaries of the clusters ( shown dashed ) .",
    "we note that incorporating periodic boundary conditions in order to construct a total contour as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : projection ] is nontrivial from the numerical point of view .",
    "when the excursion set touches all the boundaries ( as , for example , at a very low thresold of density , below the percolation threshold ) , the corresponding algorithm could further run into an infinite loop , which makes it impractical for implementation . in the light of this , it would be more manegeable if we restricted ourselves to using contours which are closed at the boundaries of the box ( like the ones in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : projection ] ) , but devise a way to exclude the _ excess _ contribution to surface area and mean curvature from the boundaries of the box",
    ". a uniform prescription of this type , when applied to all the appropriate clusters at all the thresholds of density will lead to correct estimation of all the global mfs .",
    "this then , is the choice of boundary conditions incorporated in our calculation of a grf .",
    "a futher cautionary note concerns the familiar w - shape of the genus - curve .",
    "recall that the genus - curve peaks at @xmath142 signifying a sponge - like topology of the medium at the mean density threshold .",
    "note further that g(@xmath143)= @xmath82g(0)@xmath144 are the two negative minima of the genus curve .",
    "in fact for @xmath145 1 , the genus is _ always _ negative , and approaches zero from below when @xmath146 . for @xmath147 , this negative",
    "genus refers to isolated underdense regions ( bubbles ) in the overdense excursion set .",
    "similarly , the negative genus for @xmath148 should be interpreted as being caused by isolated overdense regions ( meatballs ) in the underdense excursion set . to summarize , in order to determine the genus for a grf we need to estimate the genus of the _ overdense _ excursion set for @xmath1490 and the genus of the _ underdense _ excursion set for @xmath150 0 , thereby making use of the symmetry property of the grfs .",
    "( note however that in our earlier determination of the genus curve for n - body simulations in this paper , we have dealt with the topology of overdense regions only , because of which the genus curve is asymmetric with respect to @xmath151 and is _ always positive _ when @xmath148 . )",
    "figure [ fig : results2.5 ] shows the global mfs averaged over 3 realizations of the density field ( solid lines with 1@xmath136 error bars ) along with the exact analytical results ( shown dotted ) .",
    "there are in all 40 levels for every realization .",
    "figure [ fig : results2.5 ] clearly shows the remarkable agreement between exact theoretical results ( [ eq : apmf1 ] ) - ( [ eq : apmf4 ] ) and numerical estimates obtained using surfgen .",
    "we therefore conclude that surfgen determines the mf s of a grf to great precision .",
    "the above discussion demonstrated the important role played by boundary conditions in reproducing the analytical predictions for grfs .",
    "having tested the performance of surfgen against grfs , we are faced with the following choice of boundary conditions when dealing with n@xmath8body simulations and mock / real galaxy catalogues : ( i ) we could either correct for the boundaries when dealing with the overdense regions which encounter the faces of the survey - volume , or , ( ii ) we could avoid doing this and treat all measurements with a tacit understanding that area and mean curvature contain an excess contribution which arises because of boundary effects . of the two options , the former is computationally more demanding .",
    "in addition , its effect is appreciable only significantly after the system has percolated , i.e. , when there are a large number of clusters touching the boundaries of the box .",
    "the corresponding value of the filling factor ( ff@xmath152 @xmath153 ff@xmath154 ) is useful only when one wishes to compare two samples through the trends in their global mfs . since the structural elements of the cosmic web ( superclusters , voids ) are usually identified near the percolation threshold , and are therefore not very sensitive to boundary effects , we have chosen option ( ii ) in our analysis of n - body simulations in this paper .",
    "option ( ii ) is also more suited for dealing with real galaxy catalogues which do not satisfy periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we should also point out that since we compare two samples under the same conditions @xmath8 the same volume and dimensions of the box , same resolution , etc.@xmath8 the excess contribution to the area and mean curvature caused by box boundaries enters in identical fashion for both the samples .",
    "we therefore prefer option ( ii ) to ( i ) and all our simulations in section 5 are analysed without correcting for contributions from the boundaries .",
    "( it may also be noted that the contribution from the boundaries becomes less important as we deal with larger survey volumes . )"
