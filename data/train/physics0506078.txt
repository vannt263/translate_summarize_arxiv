    "cherenkov radiation from relativistic particles has been known for over 70 years @xcite .",
    "however , to date , almost all studies have concentrated on the radiation from individual particles .",
    "frank @xcite , eidman@xcite and balazs @xcite considered the cherenkov radiation from electric and magnetic dipoles , but only in the limit of vanishing separations @xmath1 .",
    "their work was nicely reviewed by jelley @xcite .",
    "several more recent calculations have considered cherenkov radiation from entire electromagnetic showers , in the coherent or almost coherent limit @xcite .",
    "the fields from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 largely cancel , and the bulk of the coherent radiation is due to the net excess of @xmath3 over @xmath2 ( the askaryan effect ) @xcite .",
    "hadronic showers produce radiation through the same mechanism @xcite .",
    "coherent radiation occurs when the wavelength of the radiation is large compared to the radial extent of the shower ; for real materials , this only occurs for radio waves .    here",
    ", we consider another case , the reduction of radiation from slightly - separated oppositely - charged co - moving pairs .",
    "this includes @xmath0 pairs produced by photon conversion .",
    "when high - energy photons convert to @xmath0 pairs , the pair opening angle is small and the @xmath2 and @xmath3 separate slowly .    near the pair",
    ", the electric and magnetic fields from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 must be considered separately . however , for an observer far away from the pair ( compared to the pair separation @xmath1 ) , the electric and magnetic fields from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 largely cancel .",
    "cherenkov radiation is produced at a distance of the order of the photon wavelength @xmath4 from the charged particle trajectory .",
    "so , for @xmath5 , cancellation reduces the cherenkov radiation from a pair to below that for two independent particles . for a typical pair opening angle @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the photon energy and @xmath8 the electron mass , without multiple scattering , @xmath9 for a distance @xmath10 . for blue light ( @xmath11 nm ) from a 1 tev pair , the radiation is reduced until the pair travels a distance of 40 cm ( neglecting multiple scattering ) .",
    "a similar cancellation effect was observed for energetic ( @xmath12 gev ) @xmath0 pairs in nuclear emulsions @xcite .",
    "ionization from newly created @xmath0 pairs is reduced when the pair separation is less than the screening distance for ionization in the target .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the cherenkov radiation from @xmath0 pairs , simulate optical radiation from pairs follow realistic trajectories , and consider the radiation from electromagnetic showers .",
    "we consider two classes of experiments : underwater / in - ice neutrino observatories and air cherenkov telescopes .",
    "cherenkov radiation from closely spaced @xmath0 pairs can be derived by extending the derivation for point charges , by replacing a point charge with an oppositely charged , separated pair .",
    "we sketch the derivation for radiation from point charges , review previous work on radiation from infinitesimal dipoles , and derive the expression for cherenkov radiation from a closely - spaced co - moving pair .",
    "we follow the notation and derivation from ref . @xcite . in",
    "fourier space , the charge density @xmath13 and current density @xmath14 from a point charge @xmath15 propagating with speed @xmath16 in the @xmath17 direction can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the wave vector and @xmath20 the photon energy .",
    "this current deposits energy into the medium through electromagnetic interactions .",
    "we use maxwell s equations beyond a radius @xmath21 around the particle track , where @xmath21 is comparable to the average atomic separation .",
    "then , by conservation of energy , the cherenkov radiation power is equal to the the energy flow through a cylinder of this radius , giving @xmath22 @xmath23 is the component of @xmath24 parallel to the particle track , and @xmath25 is the component of @xmath26 in the @xmath27 direction , evaluated at an impact parameter @xmath28 at a point with @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we omit the time - phase factors for brevity .    using the wave equations in a dielectric medium and the definition of fields , then integrating over momenta , which eliminates the space - phase factors",

    "the far - field radiation depends on the asymptotic form of the energy deposition at @xmath36 . for @xmath37 for real @xmath38 , @xmath39 is completely imaginary .",
    "the asymptotic contribution of the bessel functions in the integrand of @xmath40 is finite , giving the well - known expression for the cherenkov radiation @xmath41 note how @xmath21 has dropped out ( * ? ? ?",
    "the derivation of this cherenkov radiation may be expanded to give the field from a pair .",
    "the radiation from an @xmath0 pairs depends on two parameters : the separation @xmath1 and the angle between the direction of motion and the orientation of the pair . for relativistic pairs created by photon conversion , the transverse ( to the direction of motion )",
    "separation is important ; the longitudinal separation of a highly relativistic pair can be neglected , due to lorentz length contraction .",
    "balazs @xcite provided an expression for cherenkov radiation from an infinitesimal dipole @xmath42 oriented transverse to its momentum .",
    "the fields are approximated by by a linear taylor expansion of the corresponding point - charge fields :    @xmath43    where @xmath1 is the effective pair separation , so @xmath44 . then , following the same steps as in the point - charge case , balazs finds @xmath45    for a point dipole oriented parallel to its direction of motion , the radiation is negligible for @xmath46 @xcite .    to compute the cherenkov radiation for finite separations @xmath1 ,",
    "let us consider a pair moving in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "the pair lies entirely in the transverse plane @xmath48-@xmath49 , with the line between them making an angle @xmath50 with respect to the @xmath48-axis .",

    "[ eq : mono e1 ] is @xmath54\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 as before , we take @xmath56 and @xmath57 , so we need only consider @xmath58 ; there is little interference for @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we can simplify using @xmath60 then , as before , considering completely imaginary @xmath39 and @xmath36 , @xmath61 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a similar expression for @xmath62 . here",
    "we have taken @xmath63 in the denominator .    at @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "the cherenkov radiation is no longer symmetric about the direction of motion , and vanishes at right angles to the direction of the dipole . as the charge separation increases ( or the wavelength decreases )",
    ", the angular distribution evolves from two wide lobes into a many - lobed structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angdist ] .",
    "after integration over even a narrow range of @xmath20 or @xmath1 , the angular distribution becomes an almost - complete disk , with two narrow zeroes remaining at a direction perpendicular to the dipole vector .",
    "m ( dashed line ) and 5 @xmath66 m ( dotted line ) , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . ]    after assembling the pieces , and averaging over @xmath50 , we find the generalization of eq .",

    "the @xmath40 is twice that expected for an independent particle ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : mono de / dx ] ) ) .",
    "the transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "as the emission wavelength @xmath4 approaches @xmath1 , the pair spectrum converges to the point - charge spectrum in an oscillatory fashion , characteristic of the bessel function .",
    "for certain values of @xmath73 , the radiation exceeds that of two independent charged particles .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we assume that media satisfy @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is independent of frequency . in realistic detection media , any variation of @xmath75 with frequency is small , and would have little effect on cherenkov radiation from relativistic particles .    with real @xmath0 pairs ,",
    "two effects should be considered .",
    "electromagnetic radiation is not emitted instantaneously , but occurs while the radiating particles travel a distance known as the formation length , @xmath76 .",
    "for cherenkov radiation , @xmath77 @xcite , depends only on the cherenkov emission angle , @xmath78 and the photon wavelength ; @xmath76 depends only slightly ( through @xmath79 ) on the electron energy .    ,",
    "solid line is for @xmath0 with the particles considered independently , and the dashed lines are for pairs treated coherently , with separations 100 nm , 1 @xmath66 m and 5 @xmath66 m . ]    while the pair is covering the distance @xmath76 , the pair separation will change by an amount @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the angle between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 velocity vectors . since @xmath81 is of order @xmath82 , @xmath83 , so the change in separation is not significant .",
    "second , the cherenkov radiation produced at a point ( @xmath84-coordinate ) depends on the fields emitted by the charged particles at earlier times , when @xmath1 may be different than at the point of radiation . for full rigor",
    ", these retarded separations should be used in the calculation . again , this has a negligible effect on the results .",
    "many experiments study cherenkov radiation from large electromagnetic showers .",
    "the radiation from a shower may be less than would be expected if every particle were treated as independent .",
    "we use a simple simulation to consider 300 to 800 nm radiation from electromagnetic showers .",
    "this frequency range is typical for photomultiplier based cherenkov detectors ; at longer wavelength , there is little radiation , while shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the glass in the phototube .",
    "we simulated 1000 @xmath85 conversions to @xmath0 pairs with total energies from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ev .",
    "pairs were produced with the energy partitioned between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 following the bethe - heitler differential cross section @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the electron ( or positron energy)@xcite . at high energies in dense media ( above @xmath90 ev in water or ice ) ,",
    "the lpm effect becomes important , and more asymmetric pairs predominate @xcite .",
    "the pairs are generated with initial opening angle of @xmath6 ; the fixed angle is a simplification , but the pair separation is dominated by multiple scattering , so it has little effect on our results .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath2 are tracked through a water medium ( with @xmath91 ) in steps of @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the radiation length , 36.1 cm in water . at each step , the particles multiple - scatter , following a gaussian approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "the particles radiate bremsstrahlung photons , using a simplified model where photon emission follows a poisson distribution , with mean free path @xmath93 .",
    "although this model has almost no soft bremsstrahlung , soft emission has little effect on cherenkov radiation , since the electron or positron velocity is only slightly affected .    at each step , we compute the cherenkov radiation for each pair .",
    "they are treated coherently when @xmath94 ; at larger separations the particles radiate independently .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceren ] , the particles in lower energy pairs ( @xmath95 ev ) radiate almost independently . in contrast , the radiation from very high energy pairs ( @xmath96 ev ) is largely suppressed .",
    "the broad excursions slightly above unity occur when @xmath97 for many of the scattered pairs .",
    "( leftmost , dot - dashed curve ) to @xmath98 ev ( rightmost , dotted curve ) vs. the distance travelled by the pair in water , relative to emission from two independent particles . ]",
    "at least two types of astrophysical observatories depend on cherenkov radiation .",
    "water and ice based neutrino observatories observe cherenkov radiation from the charged particles produced in neutrino interactions , and air cherenkov telescopes look for @xmath85-ray induced electromagnetic showers in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "current neutrino observatories can search for electron neutrinos with energies above 50 tev ( for @xmath99 , the threshold is much lower ) @xcite .",
    "they use large arrays of photomultiplier tubes to observe the cherenkov radiation from @xmath100 induced showers . for water , @xmath101 ,",
    "[ fig : ceren ] shows that @xmath102 while the pair travels significant distances .",
    "ice is similar to water , with a slightly lower density ; @xmath75 of ice depends on its structure , and is typically @xmath103 @xcite .    to quantify the effect of cherenkov radiation from @xmath100 interactions , we use a toy model of an electromagnetic shower .",
    "the shower evolves through generations , with each generation having twice as many particles as the preceding generation , with half the energy .",
    "each generation evolves over a distance of @xmath93 ; other simulations have evolved generations over a shorter distance @xmath104 , leading to a more compact shower @xcite . in these showers ,",
    "most of the particles are produced in the last radiation lengths .",
    "[ fig : toy ] shows the cherenkov radiation expected from a model @xmath87 ev shower with coherent cherenkov radiation ( solid line ) and in a model where all particles radiate independently ( dotted line ) . this model does not include the lpm effect , so it should be considered only illustrative .",
    "the lpm effect lengthens the high - energy ( above a few @xmath98 ev ) portion of the shower . by spreading the shower longitudinally",
    ", the lpm effect will give the electrons and positrons more time to separate , and so will somewhat lessen the difference between the two results .",
    "however , it is clear from fig . [",
    "fig : toy ] that coherence has a significant effect for the first @xmath105 generations .",
    "since the front of the shower contains relatively few particles , it will not affect the measured energy ; the change in number of radiated photons ( and hence on the energy measurement ) should be less than 1% .",
    "ev shower in water , using the heitler toy model , versus shower depth ( smoothed ) .",
    "the two curves compare the radiation for @xmath0 calculated as independent particles and as coherent pairs . ]",
    "however , the suppression will affect the apparent length of the shower .",
    "for the first @xmath106 generations , the shower will emit less light than a single charged particle .",
    "because of the lpm effect , each of these generations ( with mean particle energy @xmath107 above a few @xmath98 ev ) develop over a distance @xmath108 , where @xmath109 tev for water is the effective lpm energy @xcite , greatly elongating the shower .",
    "so , the first 8 generations include most of the length of the shower .",
    "so , the suppression of cherenkov radiation hides the initial shower development , making the shower appear considerably more compact .",
    "the reduction in early - stage radiation should help in separating electron cascades from muon - related backgrounds , especially muons that undergo hard interactions , and lose a large fraction of their energy .",
    "atmospheric cherenkov telescopes like the whipple observatory study astrophysical @xmath85-rays with energies from 100 gev to 10 tev .",
    "these telescopes observe cherenkov radiation from pairs in the upper atmosphere ; for a 1 tev shower , the maximum particle density occurs at an altitude of 8 km above sea level ( asl ) @xcite , where the density is about @xmath110 that at sea level . since @xmath111 depends linearly on the density , at 8 km asl @xmath112 , so for 500 nm photons radiated from ultra - relativistic particles , @xmath113 only for @xmath114 . in this low - density medium ,",
    "the effect of the pair opening angle is significant and multiple scattering is less important .",
    "pairs with @xmath115 tev will separate by 30 @xmath66 m in a distance less than 30 meters ; at 8 km asl , this is 3% of a radiation length .",
    "this distance is too short to affect the radiation pattern from the shower .",
    "cherenkov radiation is also used in lead - glass block calorimetry , and in cherenkov counters for particle identification ; their response to photon conversions may be affected by this coherence .",
    "although the reactions are slightly different , a similar analysis applies to the reduction of ionization by @xmath0 pairs .",
    "perkins observed that the ionization from pairs with mean energy 180 gev in emulsion was surppressed for the first @xmath116 @xmath66 m after the pairs were created @xcite . with @xmath117 cm ( typical for emulsion )",
    ", the @xmath2 and @xmath3 trajectories will be about 4 nm apart after travelling @xmath118 @xmath66 m .",
    "for relativistic particles , the screening distance ( effective range for @xmath40 ) is determined by the plasma frequency of the medium , @xmath119 . for silver bromide , the dominant component of emulsion , @xmath120 ev @xcite ( in a complete emulsion",
    ", @xmath121 will be slightly lower ) .",
    "this yields a screening distance @xmath122 nm , which is very close to the calculated separation .",
    "we have calculated the cherenkov radiation from @xmath0 pairs as a function of the pair separation @xmath1 . when @xmath123)$ ] , the radiation is suppressed compared to that from two independent particles .",
    "this suppression affects the radiation from electromagnetic showers in dense media .",
    "although the total radiation from a shower is not affected , emission from the front part of the shower is greatly reduced ; this will affect studies of the shower development , and may affect measurements of the position of the shower .",
