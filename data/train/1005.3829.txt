    "this dust may help to explain the `` problem '' of the observed equivalent widths ( ews ) of high-@xmath22 laes .",
    "these ews are often larger than expected even from normal star formation ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .",
    "possible scenarios for causes of these large ews include very low metallicities , or enhancement of the ly@xmath8 ew via a clumpy interstellar medium ( ism ; neufeld 1991 , hansen & oh 2006 ; finkelstein et al .",

    "the first three object classes evolve rapidly , and therefore track the current star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",

    "the only difference was on the count - extraction , we chose the 50% psf regions here for the nondetections rather than 80% psfs ( as in wang et al ) or fixed radius of 1.5@xmath58 ( as in laird et al ) .",
    "small apertures give better upper limits on non - detections , and constant size is difficult for flux estimation here . after masking out the detected x - ray sources ,",
    "the net and background counts were measured in the cdf - s and ecdf - s separately ( see figure 1 and table 1 ) .",

    "since the stacked samples in ecdfs were within their background fluctuations , we only stacked the 22 laes located in cdf - s .",
    "the resulting stacked image shows a signal consistent with the analysis above , which becomes apparent to visual inspection when smoothed with a gaussian matched to the acis psf size ( see figure [ stack ] ) .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations to check the significance of the stacked signal . by randomly choosing 22 positions on the source - masked cdf - s image , then cumulating source and background counts",

    "both the monte carlo simulation and the poisson distribution gave a probability of p(s / n@xmath112.4 ) = 99.83% for obtaining a signal as strong as the observed one by chance .",

    "this test is to validate the sample by using subsets of the data from which one or two sources have been excluded .",

    "the other object ( nb673 - 62 ) was confirmed as a lbg at z = 4.4 with little  to  no ly@xmath8 flux present .",
    "as our aim is to analyze the x - ray properties of the  emitters at z = 4.5 , we excluded these 2 objects in the following stacking analysis .",
    "the remaining 20 laes in the central cdf - s had net and background counts of 14 and 61 , which yields a s / n = 1.4 , with an effective exposure time of 32.7 ms .",

    "the stacked x - ray image of the 20 laes are also plotted in figure [ stack ] , which is less distinguishable as being above the noise .",
