    "a number of slowly rotating magnetic a and b stars have surface magnetic fields strong enough to produce observable zeeman splitting of line profiles in high - resolution spectroscopic observations .",
    "this effect is routinely used to diagnose the surface magnetic field strength ( e.g. mathys et al .",
    "but , at the same time , information provided by the shapes of the resolved @xmath0 and @xmath1 components is largely neglected . here",
    "we propose a novel technique to measure the _ relative width _ of the resolved zeeman components and to infer an important global field characteristic from the resulting new magnetic observable .",
    "at each point on the magnetic star surface the local line profiles are splitted according to the magnetic field strength .",
    "the @xmath0 component of a triplet line coincides with the laboratory wavelength , whereas the shift of @xmath1 components is proportional to the field modulus and therefore varies over the stellar surface together with the field strength .",
    "consequently , the @xmath1 components are broader than @xmath0 components .",
    "thus , the width of the @xmath1 components relative to that of @xmath0 components provides a measure of _ the contrast of the field strength distribution _ over the stellar disk .    neglecting stellar rotation and using assumptions similar to the derivation of common magnetic observables ( e.g. , mathys @xcite )",
    ", we can quantify the difference in width of the resolved zeeman components of a triplet line using measurement of their second moments , @xmath2 , computed with respect to the center - of - gravity of each component : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean land factor and other variables have their usual meaning .",
    "@xmath5 is a new magnetic observable , _ mean field scatter_. it is primarily sensitive to the field strength contrast and weakly sensitive to the field orientation .     ratio expected for multipolar field geometries viewed from different angle @xmath6 between the field axis and the line of sight.,width=234 ]",
    "we studied zeeman split triplet lines in the uves spectra of cool ap stars hd47103 and hd154708 .",
    "results of the @xmath5 measurements for these stars are summarized in fig .",
    "it is evident that large width of @xmath1 components in hd154708 is consistent with the dipolar field geometry , but the @xmath1 components are unexpectedly narrow in hd47103 .",
    "some other strong - field ap stars also exhibit narrow @xmath1 components .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that this observation can not be reconciled with _",
    "any _ low - order multipolar field configuration .",
    "thus , some slowly rotating cool ap stars host surprisingly homogeneous surface magnetic field topologies .",
    "this finding might have an important implication for the theories of formation and evolution of magnetic fields in these stars ."
