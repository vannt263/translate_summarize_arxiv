    "the manipulation of small scale systems is a key feature of quantum technologies and their quantum behavior is an incontestable mark of the success of quantum mechanics .",
    "such control is an important tool to reveal the potential of quantum concepts from a practical point of view as well . in this context ,",
    "one may mention interacting nanoelectromechanical systems @xcite whose harmonic movement of the elements can be used to harness the power of continuous variables ( position , momentum , etc ) for quantum information purposes .",
    "another important example of a scalable system for exploration of quantum dynamics is the one consisting of trapped ions whose positions are coupled through dipole - dipole interactions @xcite . in both cases , one can end up with a practical implementation of a network of interacting harmonic oscillators that are encompassed in the object of study of this paper .",
    "advances in experimental implementations of oscillator networks in the context of optomechanics @xcite may also be mentioned as potential candidates for implementation of the general results discussed here .    due to their prominent role in physics in general , and in quantum technologies in particular , networks of coupled harmonic oscillators are a timely topic of interest . in the context of entanglement , for instance , the characterization of equilibrium states were studied in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "entanglement dynamics was the subject treated in @xcite . concerning favorable conditions for entanglement propagation , in @xcite , a clever scheme of minimal adjustments of frequencies and coupling constants",
    "is developed , which enables highly efficient transfer of entanglement through a linear chain ( first neighbor interactions ) of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "starting from a pure numerical study , they also found a simplified hamiltonian model ( no thermal baths ) which allowed analytical progress in the understanding of the high efficiency .",
    "this was achieved by using the rationale of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , _ i.e. _ , the elimination of fast oscillating terms in the interaction picture hamiltonian when they do not contribute appreciably for the dynamics .",
    "our goal is to expand such an idea of frequency and coupling constants adjustments in many different directions , not explored in @xcite .",
    "we present here conditions for obtaining simplified reduced models for general configurations or topologies of quadratically coupled systems and , more importantly , we work within the formalism of open quantum systems , allowing us to include the presence of surrounding environments .",
    "the contribution here allows one to envision applications of our general results to the study of thermal properties @xcite , non - classical properties @xcite or non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite in harmonic systems ; all of them examples of timely topics of research .    in this work",
    ", we show that the indirect or dynamical coupling between two distinct oscillators mediated by a general network , the latter with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and topology , can be effectively described by a simplified model containing only a few degrees of freedom , provided the rwa rationale used in @xcite is generalized . the first step of the method comprises the diagonalization of the hamiltonian of the network , which reveals its normal modes .",
    "it is here that the symplectic formalism is needed @xcite . using this tool",
    ", we can provide a case - independent diagonalization , _",
    "i.e. _ , a general procedure without specification _ a priori _ of the topology of the network .",
    "the following critical point is to careful understand how the external distinct oscillators couple to the normal modes of the network , and this is highly dependent on resonances between normal mode frequencies of the network and the natural frequencies of the external oscillators .",
    "when dealing here with topologies which are more complex than a linear chain treated in @xcite , we must take into account possible degeneracies in the frequencies of the normal modes in order to find the correct effective simplified model .",
    "adding to that , another distinctive feature of our work is the inclusion of an environment in the dynamics . in this respect , we extend the unitary description in @xcite to a non - unitary open system treatment of the dynamics following a lindblad master equation ( lme ) . obtaining an effective description in terms of just a few degrees of freedom when thermal baths are present is not a trivial task . however , under certain structural conditions , we were able to successfully perform such a simplification as discussed in this work .",
    "the designed methodology is suitable for the study of communication and transport across the network and , as an illustration or application , we explore here the phenomenon of energy transfer between the external oscillators mediated by the network .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ tsid ] , we describe the system of interest , namely two external oscillators coupled to a general network of oscillators .",
    "we add also the presence of thermal baths .",
    "notation in the scope of the formalism of continuous variables and the dynamical equations for the open system dynamics are also presented in this section .",
    "the development of the method to obtain simplified models for the dynamics of the external oscillators is presented in sec .  [ ed ] .",
    "there , we present the mathematical tools of the symplectic formalism needed to perform the diagonalization of the network hamiltonian and to obtain its normal modes",
    ". we also present conditions under which an rwa for the open system can be performed , which enable us to drastically simplify the system dynamics description to a picture with just a few degrees of freedom only .",
    "[ elc ] is devoted to an example of the previous simplified description , a linear chain . in the context of quantum technologies and the usefulness of the simplified descriptions",

    "this was first seen for the linear case of first neighbor coupled oscillators with no degeneracy nor thermal reservoirs in @xcite .",

    "different topologies are used to illustrate the applicability of the methodology presented here .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that instead of coupling single harmonic oscillators to the network , one could have networks coupled to networks and obtain simplified models involving few coupled normal modes of different networks . in this case , the first step is symplectic diagonalization of each network and then , through resonances , end up with an effective model following our recipe .    our work considers finite networks as environments for the two external oscillators in contrast to the typical baths necessary to model a system - reservoir interaction . in the latter ,",
    "the network is formed by an infinity set of harmonic oscillators or continuum spectrum of modes .",
    "our approach is of interest because it applies to this intermediate case where the network is big enough for not being amenable to analytical exact treatment and , at the same time , it is not big enough for allowing the usual approximations that follow from interaction with a bath .",
