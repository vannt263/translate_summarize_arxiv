    "the extraordinary activity associated with quasars involves accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , with the uv / optical emission arising from a geometrically thin , optically thick cold accretion disk @xcite , and the x - ray continuum arising from a hot , optically thin corona that compton upscatters the disk uv photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , radiation pressure can drive an outflow from the disk into the corona if the two are cospatial , thus altering the physics of the corona @xcite .",
    "investigations of how quasar x - ray parameters depend on black hole mass , @xmath2 , and accretion rate relative to eddington , @xmath12 , offer important constraints on models of the disk / corona system .",

    "the agn or quasar phase occurs during the episode of significant accretion that follows the galaxy merger , persisting until feedback from the black hole ` blows ' the gas away ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations have shown that line pressure is more efficient than thermal pressure at driving an outflow @xcite , and therefore , the efficiency of agn feedback depends on the fraction of energy emitted through the uv / disk component as compared to the x - ray / corona component .",
    "if the fraction of energy emitted in the uv as compared to the x - ray depends on @xmath2 or @xmath12 , then it follows that the efficiency of agn feedback will also depend on @xmath2 and @xmath12 .",

    "the error on @xmath0 is the result of measurement errors on the uv and x - ray flux , as well as error caused by quasar variability over the different epochs for the uv and x - ray observations . in general , the measurement errors on @xmath68 are negligible compared to the error on @xmath75 .",
    "s05 estimates a error on the x - ray flux of @xmath76 dex , including both the contributions from measurement error and variability .",

    "we did not model the n iv ] @xmath96 emission line as this line is typically weak and lost in the c iv wings .    in order to estimate @xmath2",

    ", we estimate the @xmath18 for the h@xmath3 , mg ii , and c iv emission lines by fitting them to a sum of 15 gaussian functions , enabling us to obtain a smooth representation of each line .",
    "in contrast to our profile extraction technique , we choose the number of gaussian functions to minimize the bayesian information criterion ( @xmath97 , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath97 is a common criterion to use for selecting the number of parameters in a model ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the model that minimizes the @xmath97 is approximately the model that is most supported by the data . for gaussian errors ,",
    "as assumed in this work , the bic is simply a modification to the standard @xmath59 statistic : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the number of gaussian functions used , @xmath100 is the number of free parameters , and @xmath101 is the number of data points used in the fit . using the @xmath97 to ` fit ' the number of gaussian functions thus allows us more flexibility in obtaining a smooth representation of the line profile , as we are not choosing the number of gaussian functions arbitrarily .",
    "once a smooth representation is obtained , we automatically measure the @xmath18 directly from the best fit line profile .",
    "the standard errors on @xmath18 are estimated using a bootstrap method .",

    "the statistical uncertainty needs to be taken into account when analyzing correlations involving derived quantities like @xmath114 , as they can bias the results @xcite .    the uncertainty in @xmath115 increases the formal statistical uncertainty in the broad line estimates of @xmath2 to @xmath116 dex .",

    "however , the h@xmath3 line is only available at @xmath175 and the c iv line is only available at @xmath176 , and thus the change in sign for the @xmath1@xmath2 correlations could be due to different spectral components shifting into or out of the observable x - ray spectral region ( 0.37.0 kev ) . in figure [ f - mbh_vs_z2",

    "we have found that @xmath0 increases with increasing @xmath213 , and decreases with increasing @xmath9 .",

    "likewise , an anti - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 implies that @xmath214 decreases as the quantity @xmath216 increases , where @xmath130 is the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted at 2 kev .",
    "if the fraction of the bolometric luminosity emitted by the disk , as compared to the corona , increases with increasing @xmath12 , then we would expect a strong increase in @xmath214 with the product @xmath217 , resulting from the dual dependency of @xmath214 on @xmath129 and @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , because the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by the disk should decrease with increasing @xmath130 , then , if the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by the disk increases with increasing @xmath12 , we would expect a weaker dependence of @xmath214 on the quantity @xmath216 .",
    "this is because an increase in @xmath12 causes an increase in the disk emission relative to the corona emission , which will then work against the decrease in disk emission relative to the corona that results from an increase in @xmath130 .",

    ". instead , an increase in @xmath214 with increasing @xmath12 implies that the bolometric correction depends on @xmath12 . because we conclude that the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by the disk increases with increasing @xmath12 , this implies that the bolometric correction to the optical / uv luminosity decreases with increasing @xmath12 , while the bolometric correction to the x - ray luminosity increases with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "the direction of this trend is consistent with the results of @xcite , who find that the bolometric correction to the x - ray luminosity increases with increasing @xmath188 .",
    "similarly , we have found evidence that the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by the disk depends on @xmath2 , therefore implying that the bolometric correction also depends on @xmath2 .",
    "even if the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by the disk is independent of @xmath2 , the bolometric correction will still depend on @xmath2 because the location of the peak in the disk emission will shift toward longer wavelengths as @xmath2 increases .",
    "as @xmath2 varies , the luminosity at 2500  probes a different region of the quasi - blackbody disk emission , thereby producing a dependence of bolometric correction on @xmath2 .      a significant amount of recent work suggests that radiative and mechanical feedback energy from agn plays an important part in galaxy and supermassive black hole coevolution ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the context of these models , a nuclear inflow of gas ,",
    "possibly the result of a galaxy merger , feeds the smbh , thus igniting a quasar .",
    "the smbh grows until feedback energy from the quasar is able to drive out the accreting gas , thus halting the accretion process .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations of accretion flows have shown that the efficiency of the quasar in driving an outflow depends on the fraction of energy emitted through he uv / disk component as compared to the x - ray / corona component @xcite .",
    "the disk component produces luminosity in the uv , which is responsible for driving an outflow via radiation pressure on lines , whereas the corona component produces luminosity in the x - rays , which is responsible for driving an outflow via thermal expansion .",
    "calculations by @xcite have shown that radiation driving produces an outflow that carries more mass and energy than thermal driving .",
    "if the efficiency of black hole feedback depends on the quasar sed , any dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath12 of the fraction of agn energy emitted in the uv as compared to the x - ray has important consequences for models of black hole growth .    because we have found evidence that the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by the disk increases with increasing @xmath12 and @xmath2 , this implies that black holes becomes more efficient at driving an outflow with increasing @xmath12 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , the @xmath0@xmath2 correlation may be due to the combination of both a correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath12 , and a dependence of the location peak in the disk sed on @xmath2 . if the fraction of energy emitted by the disk only depends weakly on @xmath2 , as some theoretical models have suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fraction of energy emitted in the uv will still decrease with increasing @xmath2 becuase the peak of the disk emission will shift away from the uv . in this case , at a given @xmath12 we would expect that black holes will become less efficient at driving an outflow with increasing @xmath2 .      in this work we have also found evidence that @xmath1 and @xmath220 and @xmath9 are not statistically independent .",
    "moreover , the dependence of @xmath1 on black hole mass or eddington ratio appears to follow a non - monotonic form , although the @xmath1@xmath2 trend is weak compared to the dependency of @xmath1 on eddington ratio . for the @xmath1@xmath2 relationship , the x - ray continuum hardens with increasing black hole mass until @xmath221 , after which the x - ray continuum softens with increasing black hole mass .",
    "the opposite is true for the @xmath1@xmath10 and @xmath1@xmath126 trends , and further work is needed to confirm this result .",
    "previous studies have not seen this non - monotonic trend because they have only employed the h@xmath3 emission line , and therefore their samples have been dominated by low-@xmath14 , low-@xmath2 sources .",
    "it is unlikely that the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath27 or @xmath9 is due to redshifting of the observable spectra range . if this were the case , then as @xmath2 increases ,",
    "so does @xmath14 due to selection effects , and thus we would observe a decrease in @xmath1 as the ` soft excess ' shifts out of the observed 0.37 kev spectral range , while the compton reflection component shifts into the observed spectral range",
    ". however , there are lines of evidence that suggest that the @xmath1 correlation are not due to redshifting of the observable spectral region , and that at least some of the observed dependency of @xmath1 on @xmath27 and @xmath9 is real . first , in ",
    "[ s - ztest ] we tested whether a sample of nine @xmath222 test sources with @xmath223 were better described by a regression fit using the @xmath224 sources , or by a regression fit using the @xmath225 sources .",
    "we found that the test sources were better fit using the regression of similar @xmath2 , and therefore that the difference in the @xmath1@xmath2 correlations primarily depends on @xmath2 .",
    "second , similar trends at low redshift between @xmath1 and @xmath2 or @xmath19 have been seen in other studies that only analyze the hard x - ray spectral slope ( typically 212 kev , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus these studies are not effected by the soft excess .",
    "third , the compton reflection hump is unlikely to shift into the observabable spectral range until @xmath226 .",
    "however , the contribution to the inferred @xmath1 from compton reflection at @xmath227 is likely weak , if not negligible , as our @xmath227 sources have @xmath228 and are highly luminous , and therefore are expected to only have weak reflection components @xcite .",
    "there are two scenarios in which the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath1 with @xmath2 or eddington ratio may be artificially caused by selection .",
    "we will focus on the eddington ratio dependency , as it is the strongest ; however , our argument also applies to @xmath2 .",
    "first , the intrinsic dependency of @xmath1 on eddington ratio could be linear with increasing intrinsic scatter at high @xmath19 .",
    "then , an inferred non - monotonic trend would occur if we were to systematically miss quasars with high @xmath188 and steep x - ray spectra .",
    "alternatively , there could be no intrinsic dependency of @xmath1 on eddington ratio . in this case",
    ", we would infer a non - monotonic trend if we were to systematically miss quasars with steep x - ray spectra at low and high @xmath19 , and quasars with flat x - ray spectra at moderate @xmath19 .",
    "we do not consider it likely that the observed non - monotonic dependence of @xmath1 on eddington ratio is due solely to selection effects .",
    "k07 describes the sample selection for sources with @xmath1 . with the exception of some of the @xmath229 quasars , all sources from k07",
    "were selected by cross - correlating the sdss dr3 quasars with public _",
    "chandra _ observations .",
    "almost all sdss sources in k07 had serendipitious _",
    "chandra _ observations , and therefore were selected without regard to their x - ray properties .",
    "k07 estimated @xmath1 for all sources that were detected in x - rays at the level of @xmath230 or higher .",
    "therefore , the only additional criterion beyond the sdss selection imposed by k07 is the requirement that the source had to be detected in x - ray , which was fulfilled by @xmath231 of the quasars ; the undetected sources were slightly more likely to be found at lower redshift , probably due to the presence of unidentified bal quasars . as a result ,",
    "the k07 sample selection function is essentially equivalent to the sdss quasar selection function .",
    "because the sdss selects quasars based on their optical colors , the most likely cause of selection effects is the optical color selection .",
    "there is evidence that @xmath1 is correlated with the slope of the optical continuum , where the x - ray continuum flattens ( hardens ) as the optical continuum steepens ( softens ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* k07 ) . the sdss selection probability is lower for red sources @xcite , so we might expect to systematically miss sources with smaller @xmath1 .",
    "however , for the two scenarios described above , this is opposite the trend needed to explain the @xmath1@xmath9 relationship , where we need to at least systematically miss sources with larger @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the drop in sdss selection efficiency with optical spectral slope only occurs at @xmath232 @xcite , thus we would expect a redshift dependence for this selection effect . as we have argued above , and in   [ s - ztest ] , the non - monotonic trends for @xmath1 can not be completely explained as the result of different redshift ranges being probed .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath10 and @xmath9 is likely due to a dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath12 .",
    "if these @xmath1 correlations were due to a dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath129 or @xmath130 , then we would expect opposite trends for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as @xmath129 and @xmath130 should be anti - correlated .",
    "the fact that the regression results for the @xmath1@xmath10 and @xmath1@xmath9 relationships are similar implies that @xmath1 depends on @xmath12 , and at most only weakly on @xmath129 or @xmath130 .",
    "a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath12 is predicted from the accreting corona model of @xcite , as well as a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath1 on the viscosity @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 is expected to steepen with increasing optical depth ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one could then speculate that the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath2 or @xmath12 is due to a non - monotonic dependence of the corona optical depth on @xmath12 , which may indicate a change in the structure of the disk / corona system at @xmath233 or some critical @xmath12 .",
    "recent work also suggests a non - monotonic dependence of the optical / uv spectral slope , @xmath234 , on @xmath12 @xcite . from this work",
    ", it has been inferred that the optical / uv continuum becomes more red with increasing @xmath12 until @xmath235 , after which the optical / uv continuum becomes more blue with increasing @xmath12 .",

    "[ s - eddrat ] , the turnover in the @xmath1@xmath19 relationship also occurs at @xmath235 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the turnover in spectral slope at @xmath236 may be due to a change in accretion disk structure , where the inner part of the accretion disk becomes thicker due to increased radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a simple approximation to this ` slim disk ' solution and found that it is able to produce a non - monotonic trend between optical color and eddington ration .",
    "if the inner disk structure changes at high @xmath12 , this change could alter the corona structure , producing the observed trend between @xmath1 and eddington ratio .",
    "unfortunately , current models for corona geometry make a number of simplifying assumptions , and do not yet predict a specific relationship between @xmath237 and @xmath12 . ideally , full magneto - hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) that include accretion disk winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> in addition , we argue that the @xmath1 trends are caused by a dependence of x - ray spectral index on @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results within the context of accretion models with comptonizing corona , and discuss the implications of the @xmath0 correlations for quasar feedback . </S>",
    "<S> to date , this is the largest study of the dependence of rqq x - ray parameters on black hole mass and related quantities , and the first to attempt to correct for the large statistical uncertainty in the broad line mass estimates . </S>"
