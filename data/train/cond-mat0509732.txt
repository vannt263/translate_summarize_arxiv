    "we continue our initial studies  @xcite of the off - diagonal tight - binding hamiltonian on the square fibonacci tiling  @xcite , in order to gain a better quantitative understanding of the nature of the transitions between different spectral behaviors in this 2-dimensional ( @xmath0 ) quasicrystal .",
    "we also consider more carefully the transition of the spectrum from singular - continuous to absolutely continuous , in going from one to two dimensions , and the implications of this transition on the possible emergence of extended bloch wave functions .",
    "the square fibonacci tiling is constructed by taking two identical grids ",
    "each consisting of an infinite set of lines whose inter - line spacings follow the well - known fibonacci sequence of short ( @xmath1 ) and long ( @xmath2 ) distances  and superimposing them at a @xmath3 angle .",
    "this construction can be generalized , of course , to any quasiperiodic sequence as well as to higher dimensions . on this tiling",
    "we define an off - diagonal tight - binding hamiltonian with zero on - site energy , and hopping amplitudes : @xmath4 for vertices connected by short ( @xmath1 ) edges ; @xmath5 for vertices connected by long ( @xmath2 ) edges ; and zero for vertices that are not connected by edges .",
    "the 2-dimensional schrdinger equation for this model is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the value of a @xmath0 eigenfunction on a vertex labeled by the two integers @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "the hopping amplitudes @xmath11 are equal to 1 or @xmath4 according to the fibonacci sequence as described above , and we do not lose much by limiting ourselves to the case @xmath12 , as the important features of the model depend on the ratio of the two hopping amplitudes .    with no additional assumptions other than the absence of diagonal hopping this 2-dimensional eigenvalue problem , as well as its higher dimensional versions , are all separable .",
    "this allows us to use the known solutions for the @xmath13 problem  @xcite in order to construct the solutions in two and higher dimensions ( as was done for similar models in the past  @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional eigenfunctions can therefore be expressed as products @xmath14 with eigenvalues @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two of the eigenfunctions of the corresponding @xmath13 eigenvalue equation on the fibonacci chain , with eigenvalues @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0 density of states ( dos ) is given by a convolution of two @xmath13 densities of states .",
    "although the spectrum of the @xmath13 model is always a cantor - like set with zero bandwidth and an infinite number of bands , the @xmath0 spectrum exhibits different behavior for different ranges of the parameter @xmath4 . for @xmath4 close to 1 the gaps in the @xmath13 spectrum",
    "are small and disappear as a result of the addition of spectra  ( [ eq : sum ] ) , producing an absolutely continuous @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "for @xmath20 the @xmath0 spectrum retains the cantor - like structure of the @xmath13 spectrum . for intermediate values of @xmath4",
    "the number of bands tends to infinity but the total bandwidth remains finite and it is unclear whether the spectrum has an absolutely continuous part .    in order to study the exact structure of the @xmath0 spectrum  the total bandwidth and number of bands as a function of @xmath4one has to perform a convolution of two @xmath13 spectra .",
    "the numerical study of the @xmath13 spectrum is difficult for low values of @xmath4 ( @xmath21 ) for which the gaps are very small , and for @xmath22 for which the bands are very small .",
    "further numerical difficulties are encountered in the convolution process itself .",
    "the desired @xmath0 spectrum , consisting of the set of points for which the @xmath0 dos is not zero , is given by @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 $ ] is the @xmath25 interval in the relevant @xmath13 spectrum of the @xmath26 approximant , and @xmath27 is the @xmath26 fibonacci number . because @xmath28 the number of intervals in the union  ( [ eq:2dspectrum ] ) behaves like @xmath29 , and although many of the intervals may overlap , any attempt to directly study the band structure and the dos requires a construction of the whole set .",
    "the amount of memory required to store such sets makes exact calculation implausible for high values of @xmath30 regardless of the value of @xmath4 .",
    "luckily , the total bandwidth of the @xmath0 spectrum can be calculated without full knowledge of the dos .",
    "this is done by examination of a set of uniformly distributed energies in the relevant range and testing for each energy whether it lies within one of the above intervals . for a sufficiently large set of energies this procedure yields the measure of the spectrum after proper normalization .",
    "+     +    for given values of @xmath30 and @xmath4 the @xmath13 spectrum is a symmetric set of @xmath27 intervals within @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is the maximal eigenenergy of the @xmath26 @xmath13 approximant .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum is therefore a subset of the interval @xmath33 $ ] , which gives an upper bound of @xmath34 on its total bandwidth .",
    "[ fig : bandwidth ] shows the total bandwidth divided by @xmath34 as a function of @xmath4 for a sequence of approximants @xmath35 . for values of @xmath4 up to @xmath36",
    "the spectrum consists of a single band . for @xmath4 s above 2",
    "the normalized bandwidth becomes dependent on @xmath30 .",
    "using finite - size scaling ( as suggested by ashraff _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) we can obtain an estimate for the critical value @xmath37 at the transition between the intermediate and large @xmath4 regimes , where the total bandwidth vanishes . fig .",
    "[ fig : finitesize ] shows the total bandwidth as a function of @xmath38 for different values of @xmath39 .",
    "though some oscillatory behavior is observed , the behavior seems quite linear and extrapolation to @xmath40 yields a prediction for the total bandwidth in the infinite @xmath30 limit . by plotting these estimates as a function of @xmath4 we obtain fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] which again exhibits an overall linear behavior .",
    "extrapolation yields an estimate for a critical value of @xmath41 for the transition between the intermediate and large @xmath4 regimes .",
    "+    it is worth noting that as @xmath4 is increased and the gaps grow , the degeneracy of energy levels decreases . at the asymptotic limit",
    "each interval in the @xmath0 spectrum should be exactly doubly degenerate ( neglecting a single interval around @xmath42 ) .",
    "when this limit is obtained the @xmath0 bandwidth should be approximately equal to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the bandwidth of the corresponding @xmath13 spectrum .",
    "the numerical data shows that this limit is to be obtained well beyond @xmath37 .",
    "it is hence evident that the large @xmath4 regime of the @xmath0 spectrum is further divided into two regimes , one ( at extremely large @xmath4 ) in which the energy levels are no - more than doubly degenerate , and another ( at moderately large @xmath4 ) in which energy levels may have a higher degeneracy .",
    "since the eigenfunctions of the @xmath13 hamiltonian are critically localized it is clear that the @xmath0 eigenfunctions  ( [ eq : product ] ) should also be critically localized ( fig .",
    "4(a - c ) ) .",
    "however , the existence of a regime for @xmath4 close to 1 in which the spectrum , or at least a part of it , is absolutely continuous hints at the existence of extended wave functions .",
    "we proposed in the past  @xcite that the degeneracy of the @xmath0 spectrum , at values of @xmath4 close to 1 , may provide an explanation for the emergence of extended wave functions as the dimensionality increases .       to illustrate the possible role of degeneracy in the emergence of extended wave functions we analyze the @xmath42 eigenfunction .",
    "these functions are macroscopically - degenerate for any value of @xmath4 .",
    "a set of @xmath13 eigenfunctions can be found by directly diagonalizing the @xmath13 hamiltonian for a single approximant with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath27 eigenfunctions obtained in this way generate @xmath45 eigenfunctions for the @xmath0 model , @xmath27 of which have @xmath42 .",
    "these eigenfunctions , given by @xmath46 , are each critically localized , but we can demand that a linear combination @xmath47 of them have certain values on a given subset of sites by solving the equations for the coefficients @xmath48 . setting the values of a linear combination to be identical on half the points along the diagonal results in eigenfunctions of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wavefns](d ) .",
    "this wave - function is an extended bloch function along the diagonal  clearly showing the underlying fibonacci modulation  but is strongly localized in the perpendicular direction .    whether the degeneracy of other energy values is sufficiently high to allow for a similar process to be carried out is not clear , but the chances for success should strongly improve as the tunnelling amplitude @xmath4 approaches 1 .",
    "this also corresponds to the regime in which the spectrum is ( at least partly ) absolutely continuous . for large @xmath4 , where the spectrum is singular continuous ,",
    "the degeneracy of levels other than @xmath42 is very small and no extended wave functions are expected to be found . note that in 3 dimensions all the energies of the original @xmath13 spectrum are macroscopically degenerate .",
    "this means that extended wave - functions , similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : wavefns](d ) , can be constructed for a wider range of energies .",
    "thus , as the dimensionality further increases so does the degeneracy of energy levels , and with it the ability to construct bloch wave functions .",
