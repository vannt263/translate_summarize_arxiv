    "flavor violating couplings of ordinary fermions to extra neutral gauge bosons and to new scalar fields arise in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "two simple and interesting examples are the 3 - 3 - 1 model in which the sm gauge symmetry is enlarged to @xmath7 @xcite , and the 3 - 4 - 1 extension where the enlargement is done to the gauge group @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these extensions share the important feature of addressing the problem of the number of fermion families in nature in the sense that anomaly cancellation among the families ( three - family models ) takes place only if we have an equal number of left - handed triplets and antitriplets ( in the 3 - 3 - 1 model ) or an equal number of @xmath8-plets and @xmath9-plets ( in the 3 - 4 - 1 extension ) , taking into account the color degree of freedom . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of fermion families @xmath10 must be divisible by the number of colors @xmath11 of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath13 asymptotic freedom requires @xmath14 , it follows that @xmath15 .",
    "cancellation of chiral anomalies among the families thus forces one family of quarks , in the weak basis , to transform differently from the other two under @xmath16 . as a result ,",
    "the chiral couplings of quarks to the new neutral gauge bosons are , in general , nonuniversal and , when rotating to the quark mass eigenstate basis , flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) induced by fermion mixing arise .",
    "in particular , the 3 - 4 - 1 extension predicts the existence of two heavy neutral gauge bosons @xmath17 and @xmath18 which , in general , mix up with the ordinary @xmath19 boson of the sm .",
    "in contrast with the sm where fcnc processes occur only at the loop level , in the 3 - 4 - 1 extension these new gauge bosons can transmit fcnc at tree level and , consequently , the study of these processes can set stringent bounds on the @xmath17 and @xmath18 masses and mixing .",
    "moreover , since in general each flavor couples to more than one higgs 4-plet , fcnc coming from the scalar sector can also be present .    for simplicity ,",
    "in this work we will restrict ourselves to 3 - 4 - 1 extensions without exotic electric charges in the fermion sector , that is , without electric charges different from @xmath20 and @xmath21 for exotic quarks and different from @xmath22 and @xmath23 for exotic leptons .",
    "the systematic analysis of the 3 - 4 - 1 gauge theory carried out in @xcite has shown that the restriction to fermion field representations with only ordinary electric charges allows for eight different anomaly free extensions .",
    "four of them are three - family models and can be classified according to the values of the coefficients @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 which appear in the most general expression for the electric charge generator in @xmath16 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : q341 ] ) below ] .",
    "the allowed simultaneous values for these coefficients are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "two of the four three - family models belong to the @xmath28 class ; the other two belong to the @xmath27 class .    in 3 - 4 - 1 extensions without exotic electric charges",
    "the @xmath29 mixing can be constrained to occur between @xmath19 and @xmath17 only , which leaves @xmath30 as a heavy mass eigenstate @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of the @xmath31 mass matrix produces a light mass eigenstate @xmath32 which can be identified as the neutral gauge boson of the sm , and a heavy @xmath33 . after the breakdown of the 3 - 4 - 1 symmetry down to @xmath34 , and since we have one family of quarks transforming differently from the other two under the gauge group , one important difference between the aforementioned two classes of 3 - 4 - 1 extensions appears : even thought in both classes the @xmath32 current remains flavor diagonal , in the @xmath35 class the new @xmath33 gauge boson couples nonuniversally to ordinary quarks thus transmitting tree - level fcnc at low energies , while the couplings to @xmath36 are universal and @xmath36 couples only to exotic fermions . in the @xmath37 class , instead , it is the new @xmath36 gauge boson the responsible for this effect because couples nonuniversally to ordinary quarks , while the @xmath33 current remains flavor diagonal and universal .    the study of the bounds on the @xmath33 and @xmath36 masses coming from electroweak precision data and from fcnc processes has shown that extensions for which @xmath37 are preferred in the sense that they give lower bounds on these masses smaller than the bounds predicted by extensions in the @xmath35 class @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the latter class a @xmath38 fit to @xmath19-pole observables and atomic parity violation data produces @xmath39 tev , a bound that is further increased to @xmath40 tev when the constraints coming from neutral meson mixing in the study of the fcnc effects are taken into account . in the @xmath37 class , instead , the same fit gives the lower bound @xmath41 tev and the analysis of the constraints arising from neutral meson mixing provides @xmath42 tev .",
    "this means that extensions in the @xmath37 class have a better chance to be tested at the lhc facility or further at the ilc .",
    "here however we must point out that , as it has been noted repeatedly in the literature , the bounds from neutral meson mixing are always clouded by the lack of knowledge of the entries in the quark mixing matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 involved in the new physics contribution , which forces to adopt well motivated but ad hoc textures for these matrices .    in this work , in the context of a 3 - 4 - 1 extension belonging to the @xmath37 class ( the so - called `` model f '' in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we re - examine the issue of fcnc but , due to the uncertainties associated with our ignorance of the quark mixing matrices , we will not search for bounds on the @xmath36 mass , but rather we set this mass at fixed values in the range @xmath45 tev ( to be justified below ) and search for information about the size of angles and phases in the @xmath44 mixing matrix . to this purpose",
    "we will use several well measured @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) observables in the down sector , namely @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , associated to the @xmath52 and the @xmath53 mass differences , the kaon cp - violation parameter and the @xmath54 mixing phase , respectively .",
    "we will also study the implications of the obtained bounds for the modifications in the amplitudes of the clean rare decays @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath5 ( @xmath58 ) . in this context",
    "our mail goal will be to obtain upper and lower bounds for the corresponding branching ratios ( br ) and to study their compatibility both with the experimental data and the sm predictions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sec2 ] , we introduce the 3 - 4 - 1 extension to be considered and present its most important features for our purposes . in sections  [ sec : sec3 ] and  [ sec : sec4 ] , we study the theoretical expression for the observables associated to neutral meson mixing and for the rare decays that will be analyzed , in such a way that the tree level fcnc contributions of the extra neutral gauge boson enter as corrections to the sm expressions . in section  [ sec : sec5 ] , we numerically evaluate the theoretical expressions obtained in the two previous sections , from which some information on the phase structure of the model can be obtained and the implications for the rare decays can be calculated . in the last section",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "let us begin by introducing the most relevant features of the 3 - 4 - 1 extension we are interested in .",
    "several details of their phenomenology have been already worked out in @xcite .",
    "the extension is based on the local @xmath0 gauge symmetry which contains @xmath59 as a subgroup , and belongs to the @xmath60 class , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are parameters appearing in the most general expression for the electric charge generator in @xmath16    @xmath61    where @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the gell - mann matrices for @xmath64 normalized as tr@xmath65 , @xmath66 is the diagonal @xmath67 unit matrix , and @xmath68 gives the usual isospin of the electroweak interaction .",

    "<S> extensions of the standard model ( sm ) with gauge symmetry @xmath0 ( 3 - 4 - 1 extensions ) where anomaly cancellation takes place between the fermion families ( three - family models ) predict the existence of two new heavy neutral gauge bosons which transmit flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at tree - level . in this work , in the context of a three - family 3 - 4 - 1 extension which does not contain particles with exotic electric charges </S>",
    "<S> , we study the constraints coming from neutral meson mixing on the parameters of the extension associated to tree level fcnc effects . taking into account experimental measurements of observables related to @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson mixing and including new cp - violating phases , we study the resulting bounds for angles and phases in the mixing matrix for the down - quark sector , as well as the implications of these bounds for the modifications in the amplitudes of the clean rare decays @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>"
