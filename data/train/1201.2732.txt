    "<S> let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-dimensional complete proper minimal submanifold in the poincar ball model @xmath2 of hyperbolic geometry . if we consider @xmath0 as a subset of the unit ball @xmath2 in euclidean space </S>",
    "<S> , we can measure the euclidean volumes of the given minimal submanifold @xmath0 and the ideal boundary @xmath3 , say @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . using this concept , </S>",
    "<S> we prove an optimal linear isoperimetric inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove that if @xmath6 , then @xmath0 satisfies the classical isoperimetric inequality . by proving the monotonicity theorem for such @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> we further obtain a sharp lower bound for the euclidean volume @xmath4 , which is an extension of fraser and schoen s recent result @xcite to hyperbolic space . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we introduce the mbius volume of @xmath0 in @xmath2 to prove an isoperimetric inequality via the mbius volume for @xmath0 . </S>",
