    "this claimed detection based on only three possible lines from two rotational levels in the strongest werner band and unconfirmed by other bands would not usually count as a detection by the standards employed by , e.g. @xcite in their 2  survey of the lmc and smc . in that study , three unblended lines from at least two bands were needed for a detection .",

    "the qso - dlas provide perhaps the best comparison sample for the grb - dlas is difficult to assess .",

    "this corrected h column is designed to place the various environments on a common metal - content scale by normalizing their gas abundances by their gas - to - dust ratios , proxied by [ m / h ] .",
    "this adjustment attempts to remove the dependence of 2  fraction on metallicity , leaving radiation field as the remaining major influence on @xmath21 .",
    "we assume @xmath44 , @xmath45 and ignore depletion .",
    "the grbs cover roughly the same range of @xmath46 , but there are no 2  detections even to very low limits ( discounting grb060206 ) . over the @xmath47 range ,",
    "the detection rate is 52% in the lmc and 92% in the smc .",
    "the 0 - 20% detection rate in the grbs is low , even at the same corrected @xmath48 , compared with the magellanic clouds .",
    "the qso - dlas resemble the grb - dlas in overall detection rate _ if _ the grb060206 is real , but achieve their maximum fraction at a lower @xmath47 than the mcs .",
    "if the grbs arise in dense star forming regions , perhaps their best local analog of the grb - dlas is the 30 doradus region of the lmc , where hundreds of massive stars have been formed within the last 10 - 20 myr . yet in three sightlines toward the edge and center of the region , strong 2  absorption with @xmath49(2 ) @xmath50 @xmath51 is seen in all cases with @xmath52@xcite .",
    "thus proximity to a massive star forming region does not itself indicate that no diffuse 2  will be present , provided the density and metallicity are suitable .",
    "this comparison only emphasizes the central mystery of the grb - dlas : why do they have such high @xmath26 and such low n(2 ) ?",
    "we take up this question in the next section .",
    "might the 80 - 100% percent non - detection rate of grb - dlas result from random chance even if the underlying distribution of 2  is identical to the other populations ? in a sample of 5 with smc conditions ( t02 ) we should get 1 detection 4.6% of the time and none 1.0% of the time . for lmc conditions , we expect 1 detection 19.3% of the time and none 7.4% of the time . for the qso - dlas @xcite , we find 1 detection 36% of the time and none 30% of the time .",
    "these differences suggest that the actual detection rate in the grbs is significantly different from the mcs and possibly rarer than in the qso - dlas , although a larger sample is required to rule out the null hypothesis at @xmath53c.l .",
    "the available data indicates that diffuse 2  is intrinsically less abundant in grb - dlas than in environments with similar total gas content and metallicity .",
    "this result is unexpected , given that grbs are associated with massive stars , and that nearby massive stars form in molecular complexes with abundant 2 .",
    "we now examine the possible physical causes of the absence of 2 .",
    "one possibility is that 2  is absent because dust is missing .",
    "2  formation is catalyzed on the surface of dust grains @xcite , so a dustless ( e.g. , primordial ) cloud will form 2  only very slowly in the gas phase . yet",
    "the observed 0.4 to 1.0dex depletions of fe relative to s , si , and zn in the grb - dlas suggest that dust is present at normal levels given the metallicity @xcite .",
    "even if the dust content , relative to the metallicity , is normal , the dust content relative to the gas content depends on the metallicity itself .",
    "the dust - catalyzed formation rate of 2  is specified as @xmath54 , where r is the formation rate per h atom , empirically estimated at @xmath55 @xmath56 s@xmath24 in the solar neighborhood @xcite , and @xmath57 is the total particle density ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath58 is the number density of neutral h alone .",
    "though the scaling of @xmath59 with metallicity is expected to follow the overall gas - to - dust ratio , and therefore the metallicity , this scaling has not been tested below the metallicity of the magellanic clouds ( t02 ) .",
    "thus metallicity may partially account for the reduced detection rate of 2  in grb - dla , but the effect is present even when the metallicity effect has been removed by @xmath46 .",
    "another possibility is that molecular gas has been destroyed by the grb itself .",
    "draine & hao ( 2002 ; hereafter dh02 ) calculated the time evolution of molecular gas and dust surrounding a typical grb afterglow , assuming that the burst occurs in a dense molecular cloud @xmath60 pc in radius and with density @xmath61 @xmath42 .",
    "their key finding is that even if the cloud starts as fully molecular at the time of the burst , 2  molecules and dust will be destroyed efficiently by the advancing soft x - ray and uv radiation . in this case",
    ", one may observe a spectrum of vibrationally excited 2  lines in the emergent spectrum if the parent cloud is not completely destroyed .",
    "a model spectrum of the parent clouds appears in their figure 9 , where strong absorption from 2  with @xmath62 @xmath42 and numerous lines of vibrationally excited 2  are predicted .",
    "=    neither of these key signatures is seen in any of the grb - dla sightlines , to very low detection limits .",
    "the strongest predicted 2  features ( vibrationally excited lyman 0 - 3 and 1 - 2 bands - see table 1 of dh02 ) , are undetected in our grb - dla spectra to limits of @xmath63 m .",
    "with oscillator strengths @xmath64 , these lines have @xmath65 @xmath51 , more than five orders of magnitude smaller than the predictions for clouds undergoing destruction by a grb can be estimated by inspection of their figure 1 . ] .",
    "dh02 state that for a cloud size of 3 pc the ionization / dissociation front reaches the cloud surface @xmath66 s after the burst , after which time the molecular hydrogen has been completely destroyed and leaves no imprint in the spectrum . if the five detected grbs occurred in dense molecular clouds like those studied by dh02 , then clouds of size @xmath2 pc would have been destroyed by the time the spectra of the afterglow was obtained .",
    "bursts occurring within larger clouds can have their radiation fronts `` stall '' , leaving a strong imprint of vibrationally - excited 2 .",
    "thus , the absence of such excitation in our spectra indicate that either the grbs did not form in and then dissociate their parent clouds , or those clouds were smaller than @xmath67 pc in size and so were destroyed before the afterglow was observed .",
    "if grb host star forming regions resemble local star - forming clouds , it might be unlikely that grbs ever occur within the parent cloud of the progenitor star .",
    "indeed , in the milky way most ob stars are not deeply embedded in their parent molecular clouds , but rather within ionized regions at the boundary of gmc , or in the general ism hundreds of parsecs from a molecular cloud .",
    "molecular clouds can be driven away from the hot stars formed within them by the `` rocket effect '' , in which gas is ionized from the edge of a molecular cloud and the cloud moves away from the star(s ) in reaction @xcite .",
    "the rocket effect can drive clouds at @xmath68 km s@xmath24 in the milky way disk , transporting them @xmath69 pc away in the @xmath70 myr lifetime of a massive star @xcite . if this effect is not known to have any explicit dependence on metallicity , so it may act in grb host galaxies as well .",
    "thus we do not expect that a grb progenitor would necessarily arise from a star that resides within a dense cloud , even though it must have been formed in one .",
    "this possibility justifies treating the grb - dla as though the absorbing material were not associated with the grb progenitor itself .",
    "we thus have no positive evidence for the association of grbs with dense molecular clouds based on 2  observations , even though they lie behind very large hi columns .",
    "the absence of 2  absorption ( as h@xmath39 or h@xmath71 ) in the afterglow spectra suggests the observed gas is not local to the grb progenitor .",
    "there are additional lines of evidence for placing the gas at distances @xmath72pc from the grb progenitor .",
    "first , one generally detects the atomic mg in the grb afterglow spectrum . with an ionization potential of @xmath73ev",
    ", this atom would be fully ionized by the grb afterglow if the gas were located within @xmath74pc of the grb afterglow @xcite .",
    "its detection indicates the majority of gas lies beyond this distance .",
    "second , one finds the x - ray spectrum implies larger columns of metals ( o and fe ) than observed in the optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "a natural interpretation of this apparent discrepancy is that the gas probed by x - rays is highly ionized and located near the grb progenitor whereas the neutral gas probed by the optical spectrum lies at much larger distance . for these reasons",
    ", we will now proceed by interpreting the molecular fractions ignoring the direct influence of the grb itself .",
    "figure  [ model - fig ] shows the lmc , smc , and grb - dla molecular fraction patterns compared to model grids calculated with the @xcite 2  radiative transfer code .",
    "the models span a range of cloud densities , sizes , and ambient radiation fields , for solar ( a ) , 10% solar ( b and c ) , and 1% solar metallicity ( d ) . to explain the reduced abundance of 2  in the mcs compared with the mw , t02 invoked both low metallicity and an elevated radiation field owing to the robust star formation .",
    "the effect of the uv radiation is clearly seen in figure  [ model - fig ] , suggesting that the apparent lack of 2  in the grbs is also caused by high fuv radiation fields , perhaps from the star - forming region hosting the grb progenitor .",
    "these models show that if we interpret the destruction of 2  in the grb - dlas as solely caused by ambient fuv radiation fields , radiation fields 10 - 100 times the galactic mean value are implied .",
    "these fields are typical of continuous starbursts of 1 - 10 m@xmath75 yr@xmath24 at a distance of @xmath76 kpc @xcite .",
    "thus the absence of 2  in the grb - dlas can be readily explained with the simple hypothesis that the absorbing clouds are illuminated by fuv radiation from recently formed hot stars , as was invoked by t02 for the lmc and smc .",
    "it is not necessary to invoke the direct influence of the grb uv - optical afterglow itself , though it emits copious amounts of uv radiation @xcite . because it can place upper limits to the amount of radiation incident on the absorbing cloud seen as a grb - dla",
    ", any detection of 2  in such sightlines would be extremely valuable for determining the physical origin of these mysterious absorbers .",
    "we have studied the molecular hydrogen abundances in five grb - dla systems and compared them to diffuse molecular gas in local star - forming environments .",
    "these grb - dlas have some of the highest hi column densities known , yet show a surprising lack of 2  when compared with the milky way , magellanic clouds , and dlas toward qsos .",
    "this absence of 2  is unexpected given the column densities of and metallicities of these sightlines .",
    "we find no evidence that the grb itself has affected the absorbing material , and in some cases there is positive evidence that it has not @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the absorbing material is likely irradiated by a far - ultraviolet radiation field from massive stars that is 10 - 100 times more intense than the interstellar field in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this conclusion is broadly concordant with the general conclusion that grbs arise from massive stars in robustly star forming regions , but the large hi columns and the contrast with analogous local star forming regions ( e.g. 30 doradus ) remain to be explained .    in the ism of nearby galaxies , carbon monoxide ( co )",
    "is used as a tracer of star - forming gas in dense environments .",
    "co can be studied in the diffuse interstellar medium using the uv absorption bands from the ground vibrational state .",
    "however , detections are challenging in low - column density 2-bearing clouds even in galactic material of solar metallicity , which typically show column density ratios n(co)/n(2 ) @xmath77 for n(2 ) @xmath78 @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "since the abundance of co should scale down with metallicity , co absorption from the low - metallicity grb - dlas is certainly not expected .",
    "given the easy photodissociation of co by uv radiation @xcite , our result that grb hosts possess intense fuv radiation fields suggests that co detections in low - metallicity , star - forming grb hosts will be extremely challenging .",
    "this expectation is corroborated by the recent nondetection of co emission in the host of grb030329 @xcite .",
    "we may therefore be left with only indirect far - infrared and mm indicators of dusty star forming gas in high - redshift grb hosts .",
    "the strong fuv radiation fields inferred for the grb - dlas raise the question of whether massive stars are more common in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in robustly star - forming , low metallicity galaxies at high redshift .",
    "there are theoretical reasons to suspect that the characteristic stellar mass increases with decreasing metallicity , owing to reduced cooling efficiency in the gas @xcite , or that the imf shifts to higher mass owing to the thermal influence of radiation in the star - forming environment @xcite .",
    "however , the available star - formation indicators for grb hosts , such as optical nebular emission lines and far - infrared emission from warm dust , trace massive stars only . while some direct or indirect tracer of low and intermediate mass stars must be sought to constrain the imf more directly , the fuv radiation field inferred for these grb - dlas certainly impose a requirement that the imf must satisfy .",
    "it is difficult to quantify what biases may result from the selection of grb sightlines by the presence of a bright optical afterglow . to some unknown extent",
    ", the grb - dlas may represent a special subset of interstellar gas at high redshift .",
    "one possible bias is against grbs that lie behind large column densities of dust , such that they leave no bright optical afterglows that can be studied spectroscopically .",
    "such a system would be likely to show 2  as well .",
    "but even the systems studied here show ( 1 ) large columns of , ( 2 ) appreciable dust @xcite , and yet ( 3 ) no molecular hydrogen .",
    "there is no obvious bias that can select for the first two factors and against the third , so we must interpret these data as if they were fair samples of their ambient ism . clearly larger samples are needed to quantify possible selection biases in the grb ism sightlines .",
