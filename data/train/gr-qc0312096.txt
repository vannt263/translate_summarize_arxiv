    "in this contribution to the proceedings of the 2003 gargnano workshop on ` mysteries , puzzles , and paradoxes of quantum mechanics ' , let us begin with a brief review of those basic notions of differential geometry that will be important for the understanding of the interaction between gravitational radiation and quantum matter .",
    "specifically , we shall examine here matter - wave interferometry as a means of detecting gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources . in a pedagogical manner",
    ", we shall place this problem into the broader context of some of the fascinating problems at the intersection of quantum mechanics with general relativity .",
    "one of euclid s axioms for plane geometry is the _ parallel - lines axiom _ , i.e. , that parallel lines never meet , no matter how far these lines are extended in either direction .",
    "this axiom is illustrated by figure [ euclid - plus - gauss](a ) .",
    "we shall presently extend this axiom of euclidean geometry to a statement about worldlines of test particles in flat spacetimes in general relativity .",
    "gauss discovered _ non - euclidean _ geometry after a deliberate omission of this euclidean axiom @xcite .",
    "he found one example of this geometry in the surface of a sphere , where there exists a constant positive curvature everywhere .",
    "this gaussian geometry is illustrated in figure [ euclid - plus - gauss](b ) .",
    "a violation of the euclidean axiom can be illustrated by extending northward two initially parallel ` lines of longitude ' starting at points o and p at the equator .",
    "these lines of longitude are _ geodesics _ , i.e. , the ` straightest ' possible lines between two points , which minimize the intervening distance between them . when these geodesics are extended north , they will converge onto , and eventually intersect at , the north pole n , thus violating euclid s parallel - line axiom .",
    "riemann generalized gauss s notion of non - euclidean geometry to that of _ differential geometry _ for arbitrarily curved manifolds @xcite . as a measure of local curvature",
    ", he introduced the operational method of the _ parallel transport _ of a vector around an infinitesimal circuit , i.e. , a tiny closed curve on a differentiable manifold .",
    "after the parallel transport is completed , there results a rotation of the final direction of the parallel - transported vector by an angle @xmath0 with respect to its initial direction , as illustrated in part ( b ) of figure [ euclid - plus - gauss ] .",
    "this rotation angle @xmath0 is thus a measure of the local curvature of the manifold .",
    "to quantify this angle @xmath0 , riemann introduced his curvature tensor @xmath1 , which we define following landau and lifschitz s approach as @xcite : @xmath2 where the latin indices @xmath3 , which run from 1 to 2 to 3 , represent the three spatial dimensions , @xmath4 are components of the initial vector , and @xmath5 are the changes of the final vector components relative to the initial components , after the process of parallel transport of the vector around a closed circuitwith a infinitesimal area given by @xmath6is completed ( einstein s summation convention is used here for repeated indices ) .     plus the solid angle subtended by this triangle with respect to the centre of the sphere . here",
    "@xmath0 is the rotation angle of the parallel - transported vector after its completion of the circuit . in berry s phase ,",
    "an ` anholonomy ' is the quantum phase factor @xmath7 that a spin with component @xmath8 normal to the surface would pick up after adiabatic transport around the circuit opno in the field of a magnetic monopole located at the centre of the sphere.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    einstein generalized riemann s notion of curved @xmath9 to curved _ spacetime _ by the generalization of the curvature of space to that of the curvature of spacetime , so that @xmath10 where the greek indices @xmath11 now run from 0 ( representing time ) , to 1 , 2 , and 3 ( representing space ) .",
    "he then applied the geometrical concepts of gauss and riemann to describe gravity : matter acts on geometry by curving spacetime , and geometry acts on matter by determining the paths of test particles @xcite .",
    "flat spacetimes still obey euclid s parallel - lines axiom , now generalized to the case of two straight and parallel _ worldlines _ , i.e. , trajectories of noninteracting particles in space and time , for two small , nearby free objects at rest with respect to each other , e.g. , in outer space , located , at time @xmath12 , in their proper frames at the two points o and p , as illustrated in figure [ parallel - world - lines](a ) .",
    "these two straight and parallel worldlines are also implied by the rectilinear , uniform motion of free objects obeying newton s first law of motion .    in this space - time diagram ,",
    "time , represent by the vertical axis , ascends vertically , and space is represented in one dimension by the horizontal axis .",
    "thus one of the objects , say the observer o , is represented by a vertically ascending , straight worldline , and a nearby object p is represented by the nearby , parallel worldline .",
    "if spacetime were strictly flat ( as shown in figure @xmath13(a ) ) , these two straight and parallel worldlines would never meet .",
    "however , like the great circles on a sphere , or geodesics on a pseudosphere , in curved spacetimes these lines can either converge , or diverge from each other , respectively , depending on the sign of the components of the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "an observer fixed on o would see the object p either come towards him , or go away from him , and would interpret this motion as being due to an effective ` tidal ' force acting on p ( see chapter 1 of @xcite for a description of this ) . in figure @xmath13(b ) we have drawn the specific case where components of the local riemann curvature tensor are negative , and the worldlines diverge from one another .",
    "since both the observer and the object are simply following their own worldlineswhich are geodesics in the absence of all other forces on both the observer and the objectthe equivalence principle still holds , and consequently this force is proportional to the mass of the object .",
    "the resulting motion of p as observed by o is therefore _",
    "independent _ of the mass , composition , or thermodynamic state of the test object at p , and herein lies the _ geometrical _ meaning of the equivalence principle .",
    "moreover , when the local riemann curvature tensor between o and p can be approximated as a constant , this force , like the action of the moon s gravity on the tides , _ increases linearly _ with the distance between o and p ( see figure @xmath13(b ) ) , and indeed , the use of the name ` tidal ' for this effective force comes from the tidal force on the oceans by the moon s gravitational field .",
    "it is important to note that while the worldline illustrations in figure @xmath13 are a visualization of geometry , and its connection to gravity and gravitational tidal forces , they are only a convenience , and do not represent any frame that can be achieved physically . as drawn , the perspectives are that of an observer who is removed from the spacetime , and standing outside of it looking in .",
    "this is unphysical .",
    "every experimental measurement is made through an experimental apparatuswhich may be as simple a device as a pair eyes used to see the motion of an object p a small distance awaythat is , by necessity , a physical object .",
    "as such , the apparatus _ must _ lie along a worldline in the spacetime of the universe , and can not be removed from it . _",
    "no _ experimental measurements can be done by a fictitious observer ` suspended ' outside of the universe .    of particular interest to this paper",
    "is the case when a ` gravitational wave ' ( gw for short ) is present in the spacetime . in this case",
    "the worldlines shown in figure @xmath13(b ) will periodically converge and diverge from each other , due to the fact that the curvature of spacetime is alternating between positive and negative values as the gw passes over the observer o and object p. such distance changes between the two objects can be measured by sending a light beam out from o , and reflecting it by means of a mirror at p back to o. the distance between the two objects , measured in this way , will also change periodically in time when the gw passes over them .",
    "once again the observer o would interpret the motion of the object p as due to an effective ` tidal ' force which , in the limit of long - wavelength gws , also grows linearly with the distance separating o and p ( see chapter 35 of @xcite for a more detailed description ) .",
    "because of the experiment by pound and rebka @xcite to measure the gravitational redshift , along with the experiment by collela , overhauser and werner ( cow ) @xcite to demonstrate through neutron interferometry that the gravitational potential of the earth induces a quantum phase shift , the general relativistic effect most familiar to the atomic , molecular , and optical ( amo ) community is the gravitational redshift ; gws and their interaction with matter are not nearly as well known .",
    "there is thus an unfortunate tendency among the community to try to understand all general relativistic effects , including those due to gws , in terms of the redshift .",
    "this can not be done .",
    "if the redshift were used in an attempt to understand the physics of gws , it would be like trying to understand electromagnetic ( em ) waves using the scalar potential only ; most of the essential physics would be lost .",
    "because of the amo community s unfamiliarity , we present here a review of gws .",
    "this review is necessarily brief ; the literature on gws , their generation , propagation and interaction with matter , is vast ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and a detailed presentation on the topic can not be done within this paper .",
    "we will focus here on the physics that underlie gws , and will delay the presentation of a mathematical review to * appendix a*.    the existence of gws is one of the most fundamental predictions of general relativity . unlike the newtonian gravitational potential , which can be obtained from general relativity by taking the appropriate non - relativistic and weak gravity limits , gws do not have an analog in newtonian gravity .",
    "this is because like electrostatics , newtonian gravity is a static theory that can not encompass wave propagation .",
    "indeed , the analysis of the gravitational redshift , as measured in the pound - rebka experiment , could be done using only special relativity and the equivalence principle ; it does not need the full structure of general relativity .",
    "just as it took the discovery of ampre s and faraday s laws to lead maxwell to predict the existence of em waves , it took einstein s generalization of newtonian gravity to predict the existence of gws , and to describe their properties .",
    ", remain parallel to each other and never meet . in the curved spacetimes shown in ( b ) , however , the two worldlines can either converge or diverge , or , as in the case of gws , can oscillate .",
    "the acceleration of an object seen by the observer o close to p is proportional to the local riemann curvature tensor , and is also proportional to the _ separation _ @xmath14 between o and p , as is the case in all such _ tidal _ effects.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    many , but not all , of the underlying properties of gws in the linear approximation can be understood @xcite in analogy with em waves ( see * appendix a * ) . like em waves , gws have two physical polarizationsthe @xmath15 polarization and the @xmath16 polarizationbut unlike an em wave , which is a spin 1 field and can be represented by a vector potential @xmath17 , a gw is instead a spin 2 field and must be represented by a second - rank _ tensor _ @xmath18 .",
    "this tensor is analogous to a local _ strain _ induced on spacetime by a gw , and is a measure of the size of the ` ripples ' in spacetime caused by the passage of the gw .",
    "like @xmath17 , @xmath18 is ` gauge ' field , with the choice gauge being a choice of _ coordinate _ systems , rather than a choice in a @xmath19 phase factor . the gauge invariant object corresponding to the field strength @xmath20 for em",
    "is the riemann curvature tensor @xmath21 , constructed from second derivatives of @xmath18 . while it is possible to choose a gauge where @xmath22the term that would generate gravitational - redshift - like effectsthis would not be the minimal gauge for the gw .",
    "making this gauge choice would be analogous in em to making a gauge choice where @xmath23 instead of the usual _ radiation _ gauge : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , since the potential @xmath26 can describe at most one of the two physical degrees of freedom of the gw , attempting to understand the effects of gws on matter using this @xmath26 through a gravitational redshift argument would miss much of the underlying physics .",
    "both degrees of freedom for the gw must be taken into account , and this is most easily done by choosing a minimal gauge .",
    "this gaugewhich is analogous to the radiation gauge for em wavesis the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and for gws propagating on flat ( ` minkowski ' ) spacetime , @xmath29 . in particular , the gravitational potential vanishes since @xmath30 .",
    "there can be no gravitational - redshift - like effects ; only the spatial ` strain ' components @xmath31 are non - vanishing .",
    "like @xmath17 , in this gauge @xmath31 can be represented as plane waves with two polarization vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 , shown graphically on figure @xmath34 .",
    "polarization ( a ) and @xmath16 polarization ( b ) of a gw ( from @xcite ) .",
    "these patterns are the snapshots of anisotropies of space , or ` strains ' , induced by the gw in the spacetime manifold , taken at @xmath12 by an observer located at the centre , i.e. , snapshots of the patterns of motion of an ensemble of freely - falling , noninteracting test particles distributed uniformly over the @xmath35 plane .",
    "these time - varying patterns of anisotropies cause time - varying phase shifts to appear both for light waves in michelson - type interferometers , such as in ligo , and also for matter waves in mach - zehnder - type interferometers , such as in migo .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    one aspect of gws that _ can not _ be understood in analogy with em waves is the interaction of gws with matter .",
    "the reason for this goes beyond the obvious differences in the tensorial ranks of @xmath18 and @xmath17 . unlike em waves , gws , like all gravitational effects , _ can not",
    "be screened . as mentioned above ,",
    "_ all _ physical observers must be part of spacetime , and can not be removed from it .",
    "when a gw passes through a physical system , it acts on _ all _ parts of the system , including the observer , and consequently , only _ differences _ in the motion between the observer ( o in figure @xmath13 ) and the observed ( p in figure @xmath13 ) can be measured ; the ` absolute ' motion of either one can not ( see discussion in chapter 35 of @xcite ) .    if only _ relative _",
    "motion can be measured when a gw is present , what coordinate system should be chosen ?",
    "a description in words of this coordinate system has been given by thorne @xcite , and has been outlined by synge @xcite , and de felice and clark @xcite for general spacetimes .",
    "more recently , speliotopoulos and chiao @xcite has explicitly constructed this coordinate system for general spacetimes in the limit of linearized gravity . its construction is based on the following physical constraints @xcite : every physical particle travels along a worldline in the spacetime of the universe .",
    "every measurement of the physical properties of the test particle by an observer must be done using an experimental apparatus . before the observer can take measurements with this apparatus",
    ", he must first choose a local orthonormal coordinate system .",
    "in curved spacetimes , this involves the construction of a _ local _ orthonormal coordinate system ( a tetrad frame ) @xcite . naturally , this coordinate system will be fixed , say , to the centre of mass of his experimental apparatus , and will thus propagate in time along the worldline of the apparatus as well .",
    "the observer uses the coordinate time of the physical apparatus to measure time , which , because he or she will not be moving relative to the apparatus , is also his or her proper time .",
    "thus the time axis of the coordinate system he or she has chosen will always be tangential to his or her own worldline .",
    "the positionwhich can be of finite extentof the test particle is measured with respect to an origin fixed on the apparatus , and is the shortest distance between this origin and the particle . however , because the apparatus travels along its worldline , the origin of the coordinate system will also travel along a worldline in the spacetime .",
    "when the rate of change of the position of the particle is measured at two successive times , the _ relative _ four - velocity of the particle with respect to the apparatus will naturally be obtained ( see @xcite for this construction ) .",
    "as described , it would seem that the observer simply constructs his or her usual laboratory frame , and it is difficult to see the novelty of this construction .",
    "the construction is done , however , in a _ curved _ spacetime , and as a result , in this coordinate system the observer o sees the object p in figure @xmath13(b ) undergoing an acceleration dependent upon the local riemann curvature tensor of the spacetime . when no other forces are acting on the object , it is straightforward to show that when p is close to o , this acceleration is @xmath36 where @xmath37 are components of the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "the second equality holds for the special case when long - wavelength gws ( see * appendix a*)which causes the deviations @xmath31 of the metric from flat spacetimeare present .",
    "this equation is obtained by taking the usual _ geodesic _ equation for the object p , subtracting from it the geodesic equation for the observer o , and expanding the result to first order in @xmath38 , the distance separating o and p shown in figure @xmath13(b ) .",
    "equation @xmath39 is the geodesic _ deviation _ equation of motion , and describes the _ difference _ in the motion between two nearby geodesics .",
    "note that the acceleration in eq .",
    "@xmath39 is proportional to @xmath37 , _ and is a gauge - invariant quantity_. consequently , although the explicit dependence of this acceleration on @xmath31 depends on the choice of the tt gauge for the gw , the _ dynamics _ ( or acceleration ) of the object described by eq .",
    "@xmath39 will not , in the end , depend on this gauge ( or coordinate ) choice .",
    "turning now to geometry and quantum systems , berry pointed out that non - euclidean geometry can often be encountered in quantum mechanics @xcite as well as classical mechanics .",
    "for example , a spin - half particle can be constrained by a strong magnetic field to always remain parallel to the direction of the field .",
    "when the direction of the magnet that produces this field is slowly rotated through space around a closed conical circuit , there results a rotation of the spin through the angle @xmath0 after the completion of a circuit . after this round trip",
    ", the spin picks up a quantum phase factor which is a consequence of the non - euclidean geometry of the bloch sphere ( see figure @xmath13(b ) ) .",
    "this phase factor can be explicitly seen through the gauss - bonnet theorem , which states that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the solid angle subtended by the circuit with respect to the centre of sphere . there",
    "therefore results a quantum phase shift @xmath42 experienced by the @xmath43 spin after this round trip , where @xmath44 for the case where the spin stays adiabatically in its eigenstate @xmath45 .",
    "after the circuit is completed , the spin thus picks up a phase factor of @xmath46 that can be measured in quantum interferometry .",
    "this is berry s ` geometric phase factor ' , or ` anholonomy ' , which is similar to the aharonov - bohm phase factor picked up by an electron after it traverses a circuit on the surface of a sphere surrounding a dirac monopole .",
    "irrespective of the great successes of differential geometric concepts in classical physics , since all objects at a fundamental level obey quantum mechanics , the notion of ` worldlines ' , or of ` geodesics ' , or of ` trajectories ' in general , is problematic because of the uncertainty principle .",
    "as bohr has taught us , we must fundamentally abandon the notion of _ classical trajectories _ in quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , from berry s work it is well known that geometric concepts are fruitful in quantum mechanics as well .",
    "the crucial question then arises : how does one _ operationally measure _ spacetime curvature in a quantum world ? as a corollary , how does one know whether a spacetime is _ precisely _ flat or not ?",
    "the answer : by means of the interference of _ quantum _ test particles using matter - wave interferometry , as these test particles move through spacetime .",
    "these test particles are _ quantum _ in the sense that in the interferometer , we can not know , even in principle , _ which path _ , in the quasi - classical limit , a given particle actually took",
    ". hence we are strongly motivated to examine the problem of matter - wave interference as a means of quantifying the problem of the _ quantum measurement _ of the curvature of time - varying spacetime geometries , and in particular , the specific case of those associated with gravitational radiation .",
    "this is closely related to the more general question : how does @xmath47 radiation interact with @xmath48 matter ? as we shall see below",
    ", this question already arises in an interesting way at the level of @xmath49 quantum matter interacting with _ weak , linearized _ gws .",
    "this problem is a @xmath50 one both in the matter and the field sectors of the theory , and should therefore be calculable using linear response theory .",
    "polarization passes over the interferometer propagating from left to right , the left and right sides of the squid , which are spaced by half a wavelength of a gw , causes tidal forces that reverse in sign from left to right .",
    "these forces induce a time - varying phase shift , which can be detected by means of the josephson junction.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one of the authors ( ryc ) started thinking about this problem two decades ago @xcite , when he asked the question : if the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , an early form of a matter - wave interferometer , can very sensitively measure the aharonov - bohm phase , what would happen if one were to replace the _ charged _ particles inside the squid by _ neutral _ particles ? is there some magnetic - like field leading to an analog of the aharonov - bohm effect , so that the neutral version of the squid can also sensitively measure this field ? at that time , the answer seemed to be that the lense - thirring field of general relativity was this magnetic - like field .",
    "a natural extension of this question was : if one could sensitively measure _ stationary _ gravitational fields by means of quantum interference , could one also sensitively measure _ time - varying _ gravitational fields , i.e. , gravitational radiation ?",
    "one answer : the quadrupole ( or tidal ) symmetry of gravitational radiation would require that the neutral squid be twisted into a figure-8 shape before it could detect such radiation ( see figure [ squid](b ) ) .",
    "since the neutral squid , viewed as a macroscopic quantum system , would become , for weak gravitational fields , _ linear and reciprocal _ in its response to gws , the question naturally arose : could this figure-8 antenna also _ generate _ , as well as _ detect _",
    "recently , ryc suggested a simplification of these earlier ideas , which eliminated the hard - to - make josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "quantum systems such as the quantum hall fluid , a _ ferromagnetic _ material that responds linearly and reciprocally to external perturbations , could lead to a kind of ` quantum transducer action ' , in which conversion of gws into em waves , _ and vice versa _ , could in principle occur .",
    "this coupling originates from an extension of the usual minimal coupling rule to include the coupling of spin to curved spacetime @xcite .    for example",
    ", the spin of the electron in a quantum hall fluid can be viewed as a handle , by which it can be twisted around periodically in direction by a gw , thus causing it to pick up a periodic berry phase .",
    "( the electron spin , which is a gyroscope - like object , locally undergoes _ parallel transport _ in the presence of a gw . ) the berry phase in turn induces macroscopic quantum flows in this charged quantum fluid which radiate em waves .",
    "macroscopic quantum _ process , in which a gw generates an em wave , is _ both linear and reciprocal_. because of time - reversal symmetry , the time - reversed process in which an em wave generates a gw , must also occur with equal power conversion efficiency ; this efficiency can be at most unity @xcite . this reciprocity principle suggests the possibility of a hertz - like experiment for both generating and detecting high - frequency gws , in which , for example , microwave em radiation is first converted into a gw by one sample of the quantum fluid , and then the generated microwave gw is back - converted into em microwaves by a second sample of the same quantum fluid .",
    "( faraday cages would prevent the usual em coupling between the generation and detection parts of the apparatus . ) a first attempt at this type of hertz - like experiment was performed using ybco , a superconductor instead of a quantum hall fluid , at liquid nitrogen temperature as the quantum sample @xcite .",
    "an upper limit on the power conversion efficiency for the quantum transducer action of the ybco sample was placed at 15 parts per million .",
    "ybco is a zero - spin superconductor , however .",
    "better choices might have been non - spin - zero materials like the spin - triplet superconductors , such as sr@xmath51ruo@xmath52 @xcite , or the ferromagnetic superconductors , such as urhge @xcite .",
    "our primary motivation for studying gws and their interaction with matter on the quantum level is based on the observation that matter - wave interferometers can be very sensitive detectors of gws from astrophysical sources .",
    "the rest of this paper will be focus on demonstrating this sensitivity , and exploring the suitability of using matter - wave interferometers to construct migo , the _ _",
    "m__atter - wave _",
    "_ i__nterferometric _ _ g__ravitational - wave _",
    "_ o__bservatory .",
    "the gain in sensitivity expected in using matter - wave interferometry instead of laser interferometry in detecting gws can be seen from the following argument : roughly speaking , since an atom with mass @xmath53 ` weighs ' much more than a photon with frequency @xmath54 , all other things being equal , a matter - wave - based sagnac interferometer will be @xmath55 times more sensitive as an inertial sensor of earth s rotation than a light - wave - based interferometer @xcite .",
    "this fact is well known @xcite , and the advantage of an atom - based sagnac interferometer over a laser gyroscope has recently been shown experimentally @xcite .",
    "although other important factors will also play a role , the inherent advantage of matter - wave interferometers over light - wave interferometers is expected to be pervasive , and not restricted only to the sagnac interferometer .",
    "matter - wave interferometry is based on the particle - wave duality of quantum mechanics .",
    "this duality states that any massive object , such as an atom , can , under certain circumstances , behave like a particle , but can , under different circumstances , behave like a wave with a debroglie wavelength @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the speed of a nonrelativistic ( @xmath58 ) object . like the phase of light , the _ quantum _ phase of an atom can be used to construct an interferometer using atoms , and we shall show that very sensitive observatories for gws , which are expected to be many times smaller than corresponding light - wave - interferometer - based gw observatories such as ligo ( _ _ l__aser _ _ i__nterferometer _ _ g__ravitational - wave _ _ o__bservatory ) and lisa ( _ _ l__aser _ _ i__nterferometer _ _ s__pace _ _ a__ntenna ) , can be constructed with matter - based interferometers .",
    "we shall argue here that the rapid technological advances in amo physics that have occurred since the pioneering @xcite work on atom interferometry have now made it possible to construct migo .",
    "these technologies did not exist in the 1970s and 80s when ligo was first conceived and developed ( see @xcite for a history of ligo ) ; the inherent advantage of matter - wave interferometers over light - wave onessuggested by the factor @xmath55either was not widely known or was not appreciated .",
    "yet due in great part to this factor , migo can not only be many times smaller than either ligo or lisa , but can also expand the frequency response range of current gw observatories to presently inaccessible regions , and can substantially extend the observational reach of gw observatories as well .",
    "it will also be possible to measure with migo other general relativistic effects that are not accessible to ligo or lisa .",
    "the study of matter - wave interferometry in connection with gws was started by linet and tourrenc @xcite .",
    "a few years later , stodolsky also studied matter - wave interferometry and its use in measuring general relativistic effects , including the detection of gws .",
    "both of these studies were done on the quantum mechanical level , and used as their underlying basis the _ geodesic _ equation of motion , not the geodesic _ deviation _ equation of motion , to calculate the phase shift of individual particles in both stationary spacetimes , and spacetimes with gws .",
    "these works were complementary to those by anandan @xcite , who focused more on matter - wave interferometry in stationary spacetimes and the sagnac effect",
    ". he also used the quantum mechanical framework based on the geodesic equation .",
    "more recently , statements of the impracticality of using atom interferometry to detect gws have been made by kasevich and coworkers @xcite .",
    "studies of gw antennas using quantum condensed matter systems such as superfluids have also been done , and were started by anandan and chiao @xcite .",
    "the extension of the quantum - mechanical - based analysis to a quantum - field - theoretic approach for spin - zero particles was done by cai and papini @xcite .",
    "later , bord and coworkers , in a series of papers @xcite , revisited the question of matter - wave interferometry and the measurement of gravitational effectsboth stationary and nonstationaryusing also quantum - field - theoretic methods , but now with the dirac equation on curved spacetimes for a spin - half particle as their starting point .",
    "all of these quantum - field - theoretic approaches nevertheless resulted in a phase shift that is similar to linet - tourrenc s and to stodolsky s .",
    "what has not been well appreciated in the previous work in matter - wave interferometry and its use in detecting gws is that gravity , unlike the other forces of nature , can not be screened .",
    "thus , when a gw passes through a system , say a matter - wave interferometer , the gw acts on _ all _ parts of the system .",
    "consequently , only _ differences _ between particles can be measured @xcite , and in the long - wavelength limit for gws , the motion of particles is described by the geodesic _ deviation _ equation eq .",
    "@xmath39 , and _ not _ by the _ geodesic _ equation on which previous analyses have been based .",
    "this fundamental feature of gws is well known in the general relativity community , and is explicitly exploited in the design of both ligo and lisa . in this paper , we will follow ligo and the standard general - relativistic approach of using the geodesic _ deviation _ equation as a starting point in our analysis of matter - wave interferometry in connection with gws . as a consequence ,",
    "we arrive at an a phase shift for migo that is very much different than those calculated before based on the geodesic equation of motion .",
    "a detailed comparison of the approaches based on the _ geodesic _ equation , such as those listed in the above , versus our approach based on the geodesic _ deviation _ equation will be presented elsewhere @xcite ; we shall only present a general critique of the geodesic - equation approaches here .    unlike ligo , which uses laser interferometry to very accurately measure slight shifts in the _ position _ of a classical test massthe end mirrors of the interferometerwhen a gw passes by , migo measures slight shifts in the _ velocity _ of atoms caused by the gw .",
    "these velocity shifts in turn produces small changes in the debroglie wavelength of the atoma quantum test massand thus in its quantum phase . like laser - based interferometers , these phase shifts",
    "can then be detected using interferometry , and we shall show that , assuming equal shot - noise limits , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the effective size of migo , @xmath61 is the number round trips the light beam takes within the fabry - perot interferometer placed in each arm of ligo , @xmath54 is the frequency of ligo s lasers , @xmath53 is the mass of the atom used in migo , @xmath62 is the frequency of the gw , and @xmath63 is the physical length of one of ligo s arms . at 125 hz , where ligo i , the current ligo configuration , is most sensitive , @xmath64 m as compared to @xmath65 km if a @xmath66cs atom is used @xcite . similarly , a comparison of a space - based migo with lisa leads to a migo configuration that is at least ten thousand times smaller than lisa , if they both have the same shot - noise sensitivity .",
    "it should be emphasized that at a fundamental level migo measures the local riemann curvature tensor _ no matter what its source is_. this can most clearly be seen by drawing in _ spacetime _ the paths of an atom passing through an interferometer as was done in @xcite ; the two possible paths of the atom naturally forms a closed path in spacetime , similar to the ones is used to define the riemann curvature tensor ( see figure [ euclid - plus - gauss](b ) ) .",
    "it is thus not surprising that like the well - known berry s phase @xcite and the aharonov - bohm effect for gws @xcite , the riemann curvature tensor encircled by the closed path induces a net quantum phase shift .",
    "however , for gws we shall see that the additional action of the mirrors in migo on the atom produces a larger phase shift than that caused by the curvature tensor alone .",
    "thus , in addition to detecting gws , migo , unlike ligo , will also be able to measure directly the local riemann curvature tensor from _ stationary _ sources such as the earth , moon , and sun for the first time , and it may also be possible to measure the lense - thirring field of the earth as well .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to present the following : the concept of migo along with its underlying theoretical framework ; an outline of the design of two different types of migo configurations ; a calculation of the expected sensitivities of these configurations ; an assessment of their potential as gravitational wave observatories . we shall also argue as to the feasibility of constructing a migo . to this end , using our analysis of the underlying physics of migo , we have estimated the specifications of an interferometer that would be capable of measuring gws , and have outlined the technologies that could be used in reaching them . what has _",
    "not _ been done here is a complete analysis of the systematic errors of migo .",
    "since such an analysis would depend crucially on the precise structure of the interferometer , it would not be fruitful to do this without at least a small - scale migo in hand .",
    "we have , however , estimated the _",
    "fundamental _ limitations to migo s sensitivity due to thermal fluctuations of the mirror .",
    "moreover , as we shall see below , the various technologies needed to construct migo have already been _ separately _ demonstrated in various atom diffraction and interferometry experiments since the early pioneering work in the 1990s .",
    "what has not been done is the integration of these components into a complete atom interferometer that has a design and a sensitivity to detect , measure , and observe gws .",
    "it is unfortunate that misconceptions of atom interferometry , on the one hand , and laser gravitational wave detection schemes , on the other hand , are prevalent among both the ligo and the amo communities . among the amo community , on the one hand , it is often believed that it is the light beams in the arms of ligo s interferometer that is being acted upon by the gw ; the mirrors plays little role .",
    "precisely the opposite is true . in thorne s ` proper reference frame ' , it is the action of the gws on the end mirrors of the interferometer , which are suspended vertically with piano wires , that is being measured ; light is used simply as a means to measure the shifts in the mirror s position .",
    "in addition , the amo community often tries to understand the properties of gws and their interaction with matter through an analogy with the gravitational redshift .",
    "this also is too naive .",
    "as we have described in the introduction , gws are a _",
    "dynamical _ effect , while the gravitational redshift is a _",
    "static _ effect . attempting to understand the action of gws on matter with the gravitational redshift is like trying to understand electromagnetic waves using only the scalar potential .",
    "next , the fundamental difference between geodesic motion and geodesic _ deviation _ motion is not appreciated . in stationary spacetimes , such as",
    "that surrounding the earth , a global coordinate system can be constructed , and the motion of test particles can be described using the geodesic equation @xcite . in non - stationary spacetimes , such as when a gw is present , such a coordinate system can not be constructed , and only the _ relative _ motion of test particles can be described , resulting , in the long - wavelength limit , in the geodesic _ deviation _ equation of motion .    among the ligo community",
    ", on the other hand , it is often thought that the use of atom interferometry to detect gws simply involves replacing the light beams in ligo with atomic beams .",
    "the gain in sensitivity is then only due to the shorter de broglie wavelength of the atoms compared with the wavelength of the light currently used ligo ; it is still the motion of the mirrors that will be measured .",
    "this viewpoint also is too naive .",
    "atoms are not photons , and their response to gws is different than that of photons . as we shall see below , the _",
    "atoms used in migo are moving so slowly that it is the effect of the gws on the speed of the _ atoms _ that will be measured ; the motion of the mirrors are a secondary effect .",
    "we hope that the pedagogical nature of this paper will dispel these misconceptions .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the physics underlying matter - wave interferometers .",
    "detailed reviews can be found in @xcite .",
    "matter - wave interferometry is based on the particle - wave duality principle of quantum mechanics , which states that every massive quantum object characteristics of both a particle and a wave . which of these two characteristics it exhibits depends on the properties an experimentalist wishes to measure or exploit .",
    "using this principle , various interferometers have been constructed with a wide variety of sources , beam - splitters , mirrors and detectors ( see @xcite ) . following the cow @xcite experiment in the 1970s , in the 1990s , pritchard s demonstration of _ atom _ interferometry @xcite using sodium atoms",
    "was followed shortly thereafter by the work of chu and kasevich @xcite with cesium atoms , to perform extremely sensitive measurements of the local acceleration due to earth s gravity .",
    "subsequently , the phase shift of atoms caused by the earth s rotation was measured not only with traditional mach - zehnder - type interferometers @xcite , but also with @xmath67he and @xmath68he superfluid josephson - anderson junctions @xcite as well .",
    "more recently , matter - wave interference of fullerene ( c@xmath69 ) molecules has also been reported @xcite .",
    "because of the particle - wave duality , every particle possesses a debroglie wavelength @xmath70 , and , due to its wavelike nature , massive particles can be diffracted , reflected , and coherently beam - splitall the properties of light that are needed for light - wave - based interferometry . however , _ unlike _ light , @xmath70 depends explicitly on the _ speed _ of the particle , and its wavelength can be altered continuously .",
    "just as important , a slowly moving massive particle responds to the presence of gravity much more sensitively than light , as we shall see below .    like",
    "light - wave interferometry , matter - wave interferometers can be divided into three distinctive parts : the source emitting the interfering particle , the ` atom optics ' consisting of beam - splitters and mirrors , and the detector . in a generic matter - wave interferometer",
    "a source emits particleseither in a continuous stream or in buncheswhich is then split into two ( or more ) paths at the beam - splitters .",
    "( it is important that the particle beam is split _ coherently _ so that it is not possibledue to the superposition principle of quantum mechanicsto determine _ which path _ the particle will travel along . )",
    "mirrors are then used to change the direction of the beams so that they are eventually recombined and detected . like the beams of light in light - wave interferometers , the particles passing through the interferometer picks up a phase shift @xmath71 , but now @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the action for a particle travelling along the two _ quasi - classical _ paths @xmath74 and @xmath75 of the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "supersonic sources were first developed in the 1960s by chemists for the study of chemical reactions ( see chapter 2 of @xcite ) , and they have a number of properties superior to the effusive sources ( ovens ) that are more often used by physicists . while the velocity distribution of atom beams from effusive sources is essentially a maxwellian one that is fixed by the temperature of the oven , the velocity spread of supersonic sources are much narrower .",
    "fractional velocity spreads of 1%0.3% for heliumhas been achieved from continuous supersonic sources , and even smaller fractional velocity spreads can be achieved using pulsed sources .",
    "nearly monoenergetic beams with very high intensities can thus be formed .",
    "pritchard , for example , has produced @xmath76 atoms/@xmath77/s / sr sodium beams @xcite , and toennies has produced very cold helium beams with @xmath78 to @xmath79 atom / sr / s @xcite .",
    "throughputs of atoms , measured in atoms per second , in atom interferometers using supersonic sources are thus orders of magnitude larger than those obtainable using either effusive sources , such as those used by kasevich @xcite , or magnetic - optical - trap sources , such as those used by chu @xcite .",
    "in addition , by seeding the beam with the appropriate type of atom , the centreline velocity of the atomic beam from a supersonic source can be increased or decreased .",
    "this flexibility is another advantage that supersonic sources have over effusive sources .      a typical continuous supersonic source functions as follows : a jet of gas from a high - pressure reservoir escapes supersonically in free expansion through a nozzle , consisting of a small orifice typically 10 to 100 microns in diameter , into a differentially pumped low - pressure chamber that has a larger orifice at its output end called the ` skimmer ' .",
    "this skimmer has the appropriate geometry so that it can skim away the hotter outer components of the rapidly expanding gas jet , thus leaving only the intense , low - temperature , central component of the atomic beam to enter into another differentially pumped chamber .",
    "importantly , after expansion , the collision times of atoms in the beam reduce dramatically , and effectively they no longer collide with one another .",
    "the beam is often further collimated by a slit at its output end , and it could be collimated yet again using a second slit at the output end of yet another differentially pumped chamber before it enters the main vacuum chamber containing the atom - based device , such as an interferometer ( see for example @xcite ) . with successive stages of differential pumping , by means of either diffusion or turbomolecular pumps , one can maintain an ultra - high vacuum in the main chamber that is often needed .",
    "in addition , using optical molasses techniques @xcite , beam collimation can be achieved without throwing away most of the atomic beam , as is currently done when collimating slits are used .",
    "the combination of 2d optical molasses collimation with effusive sources has already been achieved by @xcite .",
    "its combination with supersonic sources , as we propose here , can yield the high - brightness atomic beams necessary for a good signal - to - noise ratio in migo .",
    "most pulsed supersonic sources function in much of the same way as continuous supersonic sources , but with the addition of a fast - acting valve to pulse the beam .",
    "duty cycles of roughly 10@xmath80 can be achieved , and as a result , very high fluences can be obtained .",
    "because of the short duty cycles , smaller vacuum pumps than those used in continuous supersonic sources can be used instead .",
    "of particular interest is the pulsed source developed by powers et .",
    "@xcite , which uses laser ablation of metallic sources such as lithium ( see @xcite for a review of laser ablation ) to generate the atomic beam .",
    "the high - pressure gas chamber is replaced by the laser plus metal assembly .",
    "as before , optical molasses can be added to reduce the velocity spread , and thereby collimate the beam .      with the advantage of being a scalable design , the great majority of the current experimental searches for gws",
    "are based on laser interferometers .",
    "a number of research groups located throughout the world @xcite are expecting to begin to collect data soon : geo600 , a german - british collaboration ; virgo , a french - italian collaboration ; tama300 , a japanese effort ; and aciga , an australian effort .",
    "ligo , the us - based , international collaboration , is currently collecting data , and lisa , a space - based laser interferometer system , is currently in the initial planning stage .",
    "we shall focus primarily on ligo in this paper .",
    "ligo is a set of three interferometers based at two locationshanford , washington and livingston , louisianaseparated by 3020 km @xcite .",
    "all three instruments are based on michelson interferometers with fabry - perot arms .",
    "the physical length of the each arm of the main ligo interferometer is 4 km , and the fabry - perot interferometer increases the optical path of the arm a factor of @xmath81 . in its current ligo",
    "i configuration , a 8 w nd : yag laser is used with @xmath82 @xmath83 m . at the end of each arm",
    "is a massive mirror suspended vertically within a vacuum chamber ; the location of the mirror assembly for the end mirror must be held in position within @xmath84 to @xmath85 m with respect to the central beam splitter of the interferometer .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , the passage of a gw through the interferometer shifts the position of the end mirrors , thereby causing a net phase shift of the light , which is then measured .",
    "the laser interferometer used by ligo thus provides the means of accurately measuring the position of the mirrors over a large distance .",
    "while each end - mirror could be fixed to the mirror assembly , the end mirrors would , through their connection with the mirror assemblies , be mounted to the ground below .",
    "the response of the interferometer to the passage of the gw would then depend on the material properties of both the ground and the frame of the interferometer across the 4 km spanned by ligo s arms .",
    "thus , by fixing the mirrors to the mirror assemblies , one ends up measuring the response of the _ earth _ to the gw , and not of the mirrors .",
    "if this is done , sources of systematic errorssuch as changes to the material properties in the earth along ligo s armscannot be controlled .",
    "consequently , instead of fixing the end mirrors to the mirror assembly , they are suspended on piano wires , and are thus decoupled as much as possible from sources of uncontrollable systematic errors .",
    "even so , at frequencies below 125 hz thermal noise in the piano wires will begin limiting ligo s sensitivity , and below 40 hz , seismic noise causes a rapid decrease in sensitivity . at frequencies above 125 hz",
    ", shot noise begins limiting the phase sensitivity of the interferometer .",
    "construction of ligo began in 1996 , and the main interferometers were commissioned in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the first science runs were started in june of 2002 , and these data are currently being analysed .",
    "the installation of ligo iidesigned to be used for gw astronomyis expected to begin in 2006 .",
    "in this section we outline two possible configurations of migo and the technologies that could be used to construct them .",
    "we also derive the phase - shifts expected for this migo , and use this calculation as a guide in determining the specifications of migo based on current technology .      in this subsection",
    "we outline the physics underlying ligo and migo , and demonstrate that they are both based on the same underlying physics , one at the classical level , the other at the quantum level .",
    "the treatment here will be semi - quantitative , and will focus on the fundamental physics .",
    "a complete derivation of migo s phase shift is given in * appendix b * , and the reader is referred to @xcite for the derivation of ligo s phase shift .",
    "like ligo , we construct our coordinate system along the lines given in the introduction ( see @xcite as well ) , and we measure the position and movements of particles with respect to the initial beam splitter ( see figures @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .    the basic physics underlying ligo is as follows : since the mirrors at the end of each of ligo s arms are hung as pendula with piano wire , they are free to oscillate along the interferometer s beam line . as a gw passes through the interferometer it slightly shifts the position of both mirrors by a small amount @xmath88",
    "this in turn causes a shift @xmath89 in the phase of light ( with wavelength @xmath90 ) used in the interferometer @xcite .",
    "( the restorative force of the pendula on the mirrors can be neglected here . )",
    "it is thus the shifts in the position of the _ mirrors _ caused by the gw that is being measured , and not the changes caused by the gw in the properties of the _ light _ , as it is often thought among the amo community .",
    "the light used is only a very accurate means of measuring shifts in the mirror s position .    as described in the introduction ,",
    "the motion of the mirrors in the interferometer is govern by the geodesic deviation equation eq.@xmath39 .",
    "since the passage of the gw causes only a small change in the position of the mirror , @xmath91 where @xmath92 km is the physical length of an arm of ligo , and @xmath93 is the amplitude of the @xmath15 polarization of the gw ; the @xmath16 polarization does not affect the motion of the mirrors appreciably .",
    "this shift in the mirror s position changes the optical path length of the interferometer , and causes a phase shift in the light used in the interferometer given by @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath95 is the number of round trips that the light beam makes inside the fabry - perot interferometers in ligo s arms . strictly speaking this expression for @xmath96",
    "is only applicable for gws with frequencies @xmath97 hz ; at 4 km , the arms of ligo is equal to the reduced wavelength of a gw in the upper end of its frequency response spectrum , and causality has to be taken into account ( see @xcite , page 550 ) .",
    "while design characteristics of ligo , such as power recycling and shot - noise modifications by the fabry perot arms , will change the sensitivity from this simple form , it is accurate enough for our purposes in this section .",
    "polarization contributes to the phase shift ; the @xmath15 polarization does not .",
    "diffraction orders other than @xmath98 are left out for clarity.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    if the phase shift for ligo is proportional to the length of its arms , how , then , does the phase shift for migo depend on its size ? figures @xmath86 and @xmath87 are drawings of two possible configurations for migo with the force - field lines of a @xmath16 polarization gw drawn in at the origin of our coordinate system . a complete description of these configurations will be given in the next subsection .",
    "for now , we note that on a classical level , the motions of the atoms used in migo are governed by eq .",
    "@xmath39 as well .",
    "however , while in ligo one considers shifts of a mirror s _ position _ placed at a distance from the central beam splitter ( which is the origin of ligo s coordinate system ) due to the passage of a gw , in migo one considers shifts in an atom s _ velocity _ as it travels through the interferometer due to the gw .",
    "thus , while an atom may have an initial _ velocity _ @xmath99 after it passes through the first beam splitter ( in contrast with the end mirror in ligo which has an initial _ position _ ) , the passage of a gw will cause this velocity to be shifted by an amount roughly @xmath100 after it has traversed the length of the interferometer in a time @xmath101 . with a typical @xmath102 , this velocity shift of the atoms",
    "is extremely small , and must be measured on the quantum level by means of matter - wave interferometry .",
    "note that the tidal force - field lines sketched in figures @xmath86 and @xmath87 break the bilateral symmetry of the interferometers .",
    "it is this breaking of the bilateral symmetry by a @xmath16 polarization gw that leads to a non - zero phase shift .",
    "changes in the atom s speed @xmath103 result in changes to its debroglie wavelength , and hence to cumulative changes in its quantum phase .",
    "indeed , since the change in the atom s position due to this speed shift after it passes through the interferometer is roughly @xmath104 ( the factor of @xmath105 comes from having two arms in the interferometer ) , where @xmath60 is the effective size of migo , and the transit time @xmath106 . like a laser interferometer",
    "this change in position will cause a phase shift , @xmath107 , where the _ debroglie _ wavelength of the atom is now used instead of the wavelength of light .",
    "thus , in contrast to ligo s phase shift @xmath96 , which is proportional to @xmath31 , migo s phase shift @xmath108 is proportional to the _ rate of change _ of the gw amplitude @xmath109 .",
    "although simplistic , this rough derivation of the migo phase shift nevertheless elucidates the underlying physics of migo .",
    "the above expression for the migo phase shift is close to the exact equation calculated in * appendix b * after a detailed analysis of the migo configurations shown in figures @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath110 were @xmath111 is the effective area of the interferometer , @xmath53 is the mass of the atom , @xmath62 is the frequency of the gw , and @xmath112 is the amplitude of the @xmath16 polarization of a gw .",
    "equation @xmath113 follows from eq .",
    "@xmath114 , the above expression for @xmath115 , taking @xmath116 for freely suspended mirrors , and setting the shot - noise limits of the phase shift of migo equal to that of ligo . the resonance function @xmath117 depends on the specific configuration of the interferometer , and measures the resonances between the gw and the interferometer .",
    "precise forms for @xmath118 and @xmath117 are given in * appendix b*. the corresponding shot - noise - limited sensitivity for migo is @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number of atoms passing though the interferometer per second . in comparison @xmath121 where @xmath122 is",
    "the power of the laser , and @xmath123 is the photodetector efficiency ( eq .",
    "123a of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , while @xmath124 _ decreases _ at higher frequencies , @xmath125 _ increases_. this complementarity between the two sensitivities is due to a fundamental difference in the signals being measured by ligo and migo : ligo measures the _ position _ , while migo measures the _ velocity _ of test masses .",
    "unlike ligo , migo is only sensitive to the @xmath16 polarization , not the @xmath15 polarization .",
    "also , while the phase shift of ligo scales with its _ length _ , the phase shift of migo scales with its _ area _ ; the larger the area , the smaller the amplitude of the gw that can be detected .",
    "when the transit time is much greater than the period of the gw , @xmath126 for freely suspended mirrors ; @xmath127 when it is much less than the period . what is not included in eq .",
    "@xmath114 is the sagnac effect caused by the rotation of the earth @xcite , and the phase shift caused by stationary sources of curvature such as the earth .",
    "while for the configurations shown in figures @xmath86 and @xmath87 these phase shifts are expected to be very large , they are , however , steady - state , and thus can be isolated from the time - varying signal caused by a gw .      with the characteristic speed of an atom from a supersonic source being in the hundreds of meters per second range , and @xmath101 in the range of seconds , we would naively expect migo to respond very slowly to the passage of a gw , which moves through the interferometer at the speed of light .",
    "( however , even for a laser - interferometer - based observatory such ligo , which has arms that are roughly equal to the reduced wavelength of a @xmath128 hz gw , the transit time of light through ligo is comparable to the period of the gw as well . ) because of the cumulative effect of the gw on the phase of the atom , we would expect @xmath108 to be the result of averaging the phase of the atom over many periods of the gw , and thus to be close to zero .",
    "this does not happen for the following two reasons .",
    "firstly , half - way through the interferometer the atoms in the beam hit , and are reflected off , a set of mirrors .",
    "these mirrors impart on the atoms an _ instantaneous _ force whose strength is proportional to the _ instantaneous _ velocityincluding the changes to the atom s velocity caused by a gw as it travelled between the beam splitter and mirrorof the atom normal to the mirror . from the force - field lines drawn in figures @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    ", the magnitude of this force will be different for atoms travelling along the @xmath129 and @xmath130 paths , and they will induce a net phase shift between the atom travelling along the two different paths .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in the derivation of the migo phase shift given in the * appendix b * , where the force that the mirrors exert on the atoms results in a jump condition for the atom s velocity in the direction perpendicular to the mirror s surface . for high - frequency gws",
    "this effect of the mirror s impulsive force is the dominant contribution to @xmath108 , and is the reason why @xmath126 for freely suspended mirrors when @xmath101 is much longer than the period of the gw . at lower frequencies ,",
    "when @xmath101 is much shorter than the period of the gw , the mirror s impulsive effect is very much reduced .    secondly , notice from eq .",
    "@xmath39 that due to the _ tidal _ nature of the gw , its effect on the motion of the atom _ increases _ as the atom moves away from the beam splitter ; the atom ` sees ' a larger effective acceleration later in its path through than interferometer than it did at the beginning .",
    "although for low frequency gws this results in a relatively small resonance function @xmath131 , the phase shift nonetheless does not average out to be zero as quickly as one might expect .",
    "the relative sizes of migo compared with ligo given by eq .",
    "@xmath113 would also seem to be counterintuitive .",
    "migo makes use of slowly - moving , nonrelativistic atoms to make its measurements , while ligo would seem to make use of photons moving at the speed of light @xmath132 . at first glance",
    "it would seem that migo should be _ less _ sensitive to gws than ligo by some power of @xmath133 .",
    "this , however , would be an erroneous argument .",
    "as outlined in * 3.4 * , it is _ not _ the effect of gw on the _ light _ used in the laser interferometer that is being measured in ligo ; it is the effect of the gw on the _ test masses _ ( the _ end mirrors _ ) , _ which are at rest _ ,",
    "that is being measured .",
    "indeed , it is precisely because the atoms are _ slowly moving _ ,",
    "i.e. , _ nonrelativistic _ , that the effect of gws on their motions are much more readily measurable than their effect on light .",
    "a gw can readily change the speed of nonrelativistic atoms , but it can not change the speed @xmath132 of light .    as a consequence , we would expect the _ slower _ the atom is , the more _ sensitive _ migo will be , as long as the atoms in the beam do not decohere because of long transit times through the interferometer . as counterintuitive",
    "as this conclusion may be , it can be arrived at through the following thought experiment .",
    "suppose we replace the slowly moving , nonrelativistic atoms in migo by a series of faster and faster atoms until the atoms in the beam approach the speed of light . in this ultrarelativistic limit ,",
    "the atoms behave much like the light used in ligo , and it is apparent the horizontal migo configuration would be similar to ligo , but with mirrors that are rigidly attached to the frame of the interferometer , instead of the freely moving mirrors in ligo . since it is well known that the sensitivity of ligo decreases greatly if rigidly mounted mirrors are used instead of suspended ones , migo s sensitivity to gws when ultrarelativistic atoms are used is expected to be much worse than if slowly moving atoms are used .",
    "seen another way , because the speed of ultrarelativistic atoms are so close to the speed of light , changing their speed by even a small amount requires a great deal of energy .",
    "the speed of nonrelativistic atoms , on the other hand , are much more readily changed , and for the same amount of energy , a gw can shift the speed of a slow , nonrelativistic atom much more than the speed near @xmath132 of an ultrarelativistic one , and thereby can cause a much larger phase shift for the nonrelativistic atom . to summarize , we would expect that the sensitivity to detecting gws to _ decrease _ if ultrarelativistic particleswhich behave like photonsare used in migo instead of slowly moving , nonrelativistic atoms .",
    "however , the slowly moving atoms must not decohere due to collisions during the transit times through the interferometer .",
    "equations @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and the conclusion that the sensitivity of atom - based interferometers to gws is _ larger _ in comparison to light - based interferometers , are also surprising when compared to the results of linet - tourrenc @xcite , stodolsky @xcite , cai - papini @xcite , and bord and coworkers @xcite .",
    "complete criticisms of these approaches will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we note here simply that the approaches taken by both linet - tourrenc and stodolsky have their roots in the _ geodesic _ equation of motion .",
    "linet - tourrenc used the quasi - classical approach based on the relativistic single - particle hamiltonian for a relativistic particle derived from the geodesic equation ; stodolsky based his approach on the relativistic single - particle action .",
    "both authors do not explicitly define their coordinate systems .",
    "they both find a phase shift of the form @xmath134 from the equation above eq .",

    "this symmetry is broken when a gw is present , however ; from the force - field lines drawn in figure @xmath86 , we see that path that the atom takes for the @xmath129 order will be slightly different than the one taken by the @xmath130 order , leading to migo s phase shift .    for the horizontal migo configuration , @xmath153the actual area enclosed by the interferometerin eq .",

    "the sensitivity of a horizontal migo is thus proportional to @xmath158 .    in the vertical configuration for migo shown in figure @xmath87 ,",
    "alkali atoms are emitted from a pulsed supersonic source , and are then _ slowed down _ using a zeeman slower @xcite to velocities so slow that the acceleration due to earth s gravity @xmath159 now dominates the trajectories of the atoms through the interferometer , similar to the atom fountain geometry of chu and kasevich @xcite .",
    "the beam is collimated using 2d optical molasses as well @xcite .",

    "the atoms are once again reflected at the mirrors , and fall back downward in an almost - parabolic trajectory where the paths are recombined by the same beam splitter , and subsequently detected . once again , the _ bilateral _ symmetry of this interferometer along now the vertical line ensures that the gross motion of the atoms on the left side of the interferometer is reflected on the right side .",
    "the usual parabolic trajectories of the atoms is shifted slightly by an amount determined once again by eq .",
    "@xmath39 due to the passage of a gw , and will again be different for atoms travelling along the left hand path instead of the right hand path .",
    "it is this _ asymmetrical _ shift by the gw in the atoms trajectories that leads to the overall phase shift .",
    "similar to the horizontal migo configuration , @xmath161 for the vertical migo configuration as well ( see * appendix b * ) , but because the acceleration due to gravity @xmath159 slows the atom down , it spends more time in the presence of a gw inside the interferometer than the atoms in the horizontal migo configuration do .",
    "consequently , @xmath162 , where @xmath157 , the horizontal velocity of atom after the beam splitter , is inversely proportional to the periodicity of the diffraction grating used .",
    "thus , the area @xmath118 is proportional to the _ cube _ of the width of the interferometer , and the sensitivity of the vertical migo configuration is proportional to @xmath163 , and not to @xmath158 as for the horizontal migo configuration , or even to @xmath155 as it is for ligo .    like ligo ,",
    "both migo configurations make use of mirrors to redirect the atomic beams to beam splitters , and like ligo , the response of migo to gws will , to a certain extent , depend on how the mirrors are attached to the frame of the interferometer , and thus how the interferometer is attached to the earth .",
    "however , because it is effects of the gw on the interfering particle , i.e. , the atoms , that is being measured in migo , and not the mirrors as it is in ligo , migo is much less dependent on how this attachment is made than ligo is .",
    "indeed , from * appendix b * , we found that for @xmath164 , the response function @xmath165 , irrespective of how the mirrors are attached to the interferometer . in fact , the _ lower _ limit of @xmath166 that is reached if the mirrors are freely suspended as in the case of ligo , and the _ upper _ limit of @xmath167 is reached if the mirror was firmly attached to an interferometer frame that can be approximated as infinitely rigid @xcite .",
    "migo thus becomes more _ sensitive _ the more firmly the mirrors are attached to the interferometer frame .",
    "this is in direct contrast to ligo , which become _ less _ sensitive . indeed ,",
    "if like migo we model the connection of ligo s mirrors to the interferometer frame as a spring with resonance frequency @xmath168 and loss factor @xmath169 , we find from eq .",
    "( 37.16 ) of @xcite that the shift in position of the end mirrors will be @xmath170 in the limit where @xmath171 , when the end mirrors can be approximated as mounted to an interferometer frame that is infinitely rigid , @xmath172 , and the ligo looses all sensitivity to gws .    from the sketch in figure",
    "@xmath87 we see that the vertical migo configuration is a combination of chu - kasevich s atomic fountain interferometer with a pritchard - type interferometer . previous to chu and kasevich s work , zacharias ( see @xcite ) attempted to construct an atomic fountain in the 1950s and failed . because of the effusive source used , there was a broad distribution of velocities in the atomic beam , and as the atoms in the beam climbed up the gravitational potential of the earth , they started to slow down , and other , faster atoms started to overtake them . scattering with the faster - moving atoms in the beam took place and coherence was lost .",
    "chu and kasevich avoided this by using laser - cooled atomic beams with narrower velocity distributions , as does migo .",
    "the effectiveness of both migo configurations in detecting gws can be seen in figure @xmath173 where the characteristic amplitude and frequencies of gws emitted from burst sources ( the strongest emitters of gws ) such as supernova explosions and the coalescence of black holes , are plotted along with the amplitude and frequencies of the _ smallest _ of these types of signals that are detectable by migo , ligo ( both the current ligo i configuration and the ligo ii configuration slated for operation in 2007 ) , and lisa .",
    "two of the configurationsthe earth - based vertical and horizontalwas designed to have a sensitivity equal to the best sensitivity of ligo in its frequency range , and the third configurationthe space - based horizontalto have a sensitivity equal to the best sensitivity of lisa in its frequency range .",
    "the signals from various classes of burst signals were replotted from thorne s figure 9.4 @xcite ; the specifics of these sources can be found therein .",
    "the plots ligo i , ligo ii and lisa have been updated from thorne s original figure , and were generated from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively , using eq .",
    "111 of @xcite .",
    "all three graphs for migo were generated using eq .",
    "@xmath174 , and a @xmath175 atoms per second ( as compared with @xmath176 photons per second for ligo ) .",
    "while @xmath175 atoms per second is very large , it is important to note that what is important is the _ number _ of atoms per second through the interferometer , and not the _ number density_. indeed , if the number density of atoms is too high , the atoms in the beam will condense , and beam coherence will be lost . by suitably constructing the supersonic source , and by choosing the proper operating regime for it , it may be possible ensure that the @xmath177 atoms per second needed to achieve figure @xmath173 is spread over a large enough cross section of the beam to prevent condensation .",
    "we will comment further on this later in * 4.4*.    a nanofabricated transmission diffraction grating with a periodicity of 32 nm was used in calculating figure @xmath173 .",
    "although only reflection diffraction gratings with this periodicity have been made by the nanoelectronic research centre at the university of glasgow @xcite , by flipping the source and the detector array in figures @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the migo configurations can be modified to use reflection gratings if transmission gratings can not be constructed . as with ligo , because gws can not be shielded , the passage of a gw through migo will shift all its parts , including the mirrors , and the response of the mirrors to the gw introduces an additional shift in the velocities of the atoms . however , since the mirrors in migos do not have to be free to move , they can be constructed so that the effect of the gw on their motion is critically damped , as they were taken to be when figure @xmath173 was graphed .    for the earth - based vertical migo , bosonic @xmath66cs atoms from a 2000 k continuous supersonic source",
    "are used in an interferometer with a width @xmath178 m and a height of @xmath179 m. zeeman cooling of the vertical velocity of the atoms from the beam is used to decrease the velocities of the atom by a factor of 11.6 , and additional 2d optical molasses cooling is used to narrow by a factor of @xmath128 the velocity of the atoms perpendicular to the beam .",
    "the space - based migo , which is depicted as a horizontal configuration , also uses @xmath66cs atoms emitted from a 2000 k continuous supersonic source , but with 2d optical molasses cooling used only to collimate the beam . as a result , while @xmath180 m , the length of the interferometer is @xmath181 km , as compared to 5 million km for lisa .",
    "( although a throughput of @xmath177 atoms / s is high for a space - based migo , atoms can be recycled from detector to source . )",
    "the final earth - based horizontal migo graph also has a @xmath182 m , but uses fermionic @xmath183li atoms from a 2000 k supersonic source in conjunction with a zeeman laser _ accelerator _ to increase the beam - velocity of the atom by a factor of 1.86 . by angling the beam slightly upward ,",
    "the maximum height of the beam as it travels across the length @xmath184 km of the interferometer is only @xmath185 m ; 2d optical molasses is used to collimate this beam as well .",
    "this migo configuration , while not optimal , is designed so that _ whole _ interferometer fits within one of the 1.2 m wide evacuated beam tubes that form the arms of ligo . enlarging sections of the beam tube to @xmath186 m will allow @xmath66cs to be used instead of @xmath183li , resulting in a @xmath187-fold increase in the earth - based horizontal migo sensitivity as shown in figure @xmath173 .    in figure",
    "@xmath173 we see that by replacing the lasers in one of ligo s arms with the @xmath183li horizontal migo , the sensitivity of the gw observatory can be increased by a factor of 10 . at @xmath188",
    "m @xmath16 @xmath189 m , the earth - based vertical migo has the same sensitivity as ligo ii in its most sensitive frequency regime , while at @xmath105 m @xmath16 @xmath190 km , the space - based migo has the same sensitivity as lisa in lisa s operating regime . but all three migo configurations are sensitive to a much wider range of gw frequencies than ligo and lisa , and they extend the range of gw observatories into frequency rangesin particular between @xmath191 and 10 hznot currently accessible by ligo or lisa . in particular , note the sensitivity to high - frequency gws of all three migo configurations graphed in figure @xmath173 , and the gradual _ insensitivity _ of ligo to frequencies above 125 hz and of lisa to frequencies above @xmath192 hz .",
    "this is due to the difference in the signal being measured by matter - wave - based and light - wave - based interferometers : migo measures shifts in the atom s _ velocity _ , and thus the _ rate of change _ of the gw amplitude with time ; the larger the velocity shift , the larger the phase shift .",
    "this rate of change _ increases _ at higher frequencies , and is the underlying reason the smallest - amplitude gw that three migo configurations can detect in figure @xmath173 _ decreases _ as @xmath193 at high frequencies .",
    "in contrast , ligo ( and lisa ) measures the _ position _ of the end mirrors , which depends only on the amplitude of the gw , and only indirectly on its frequency . for the frequency of the gw to be measured ,",

    "position__impacts their constructions , and the fundamental limits to the size of the phase shifts both are capable of measuring .",
    "both ligo and migo will be subject to systematic errors arising from environmental perturbations , such as thermal and seismic noise ; stray electric and magnetic field gradients ; and fluctuations in @xmath159 . because the temperature of the beam splitters and the mirrors in both migo and ligo can not be zero",
    ", temperature - driven changes in their positions and velocities will induce thermal noise into phase shift measurements .",
    "random seismic movement of the ground under the interferometer will introduce vibrational noise as well .",
    "however , while thermal noise starts limiting ligo s sensitivity below 125 hz and seismic noise effectively cuts it off below 40 hz , their effect on migos sensitivity is not nearly as great .",
    "thermal and seismic noise have such a large effect on ligo because ligo s end - mirrors must be as close to a freely - falling mirror as possible .",
    "migo , on the other hand , makes use of beam splitters and mirrors that can be solidly mounted on an interferometer frame whose material properties can be well characterized and controlled , because of the relatively small size of migo .",
    "standard vibrational isolation technologies can thus be used to minimize seismic noise to levels not attainable by ligo ; for these reasons seismic noise limitations are not shown in figure @xmath198 .",
    "however , temperature - driven oscillations on the surface of the mirrorseven though they are rigidly mountedwill induce random velocity ( doppler ) shifts to the atoms , and subsequently random phase shifts . these oscillations ,",
    "although not important for ligo , will slightly affect the sensitivity of migo at very low frequencies .",
    "the effect of these oscillations on migo s sensitivity is estimated in * appendix c * , and are included in figure @xmath173 . unlike ligo , the atoms in migo are subject to stray electric and magnetic fields .",
    "however , these effects can be made negligibly small with proper shielding and design .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath159 are due to density fluctuations caused by seismic waves , and will limit the low - frequency response of ligo @xcite .",
    "its effect on migo is unknown , and can be eliminated with a space - based system .    at a fundamental level , unlike the photons used by ligo , the atoms used in migo can interact among themselves ; this requires a certain amount of care to be taken in the design of migo .",
    "indeed , fermionic @xmath183li was chosen for the earth - based horizontal migo precisely because as a fermionic atom it will not scatter with other @xmath183li atoms as readily as @xmath199li , a bosonic atom , will . in this sense ,",
    "cold , fermionic @xmath183li atoms will behave more like the noninteracting photons in ligo .",
    "moreover , number squeezed states for fermions , which are very robust , can greatly reduce the shot noise of the atomic beam [ 39 ] , [ 23 ] .",
    "this correspondingly reduces the required throughput of the atoms needed for the same sensitivity .",
    "any collision of the atoms within the beameither with other atoms in the beam , or with stray atoms in the interferometerwill introduce random noise in @xmath108 , and decrease the contrast of the interference fringes .",
    "the cross - sectional area of the beam has to be made large enough , and the transverse velocity spread of the beamnarrowed using 2d optical molasseshas to be small enough that this does not occur within the transit time of the atom through the interferometer .",
    "scattering with the background gas can be made negligible by using ultra - high - vacuum systems .",
    "next , the supersonic source must be run at a high enough temperature that condensation of the gas of atoms into clusterseither solid or liquiddoes not occur . at the same time",
    ", the pressure of the supersonic source must be high enough to generate a high intensity of atoms through the interferometer .",
    "since we are dealing with atoms which can condense into liquids and solids , the allowed running temperature and pressure of the source will depend on the phase diagram of the atom , and the degree of supercooling of the gas that takes place .",
    "these issues are well studied for helium @xcite ( although they are not as well studied for the alkali atoms ) , and in general there does not seem to be a fundamental obstacle to finding a set of viable operating parameters . what is more challenging is the throughput of @xmath177 atoms per second used in generating figure @xmath173 , which is close to the limits of current supersonic - source technology . however , because of the sensitive dependence of migo sensitivities on its size , a decrease in this throughput by a factor of 100 can be made up for by increasing the @xmath155 of a horizontal migo by a factor of @xmath200 , or that of a vertical migo by a factor of @xmath201 ; decreases in the atom - beam throughput can thus be readily compensated for by modestly increasing the size of the interferometer .    at frequencies below roughly 125 hz the sensitivity of ligo decreases due to thermal noise , and radiation pressure on the end mirrors @xcite .",
    "photons in the laser impacting the mirrors not only exert pressure ( and thus move ) the mirrors , but because they are not perfect , the mirrors will be heated by the incident beam .",
    "both factors will cause an overall decrease in ligo s sensitivity .",
    "one would expect that since @xmath177 atoms per second should pass through migo to achieve high sensitivity , the impact pressure of the atoms on the mirrors , combined with the heating of the mirrors caused by the inelastic scattering of the atoms , would limit the sensitivity of migo as well .",
    "they do not for the follow reasons .",
    "quantum interference places stringent limits on the decoherence of the atom beam as it is diffracted from the beam splitters , and reflected off the mirrors .",
    "( scattering of atoms in the beam off of background gas can be shown to be negligible . ) in particular , it requires that there exists no possibility of ` which - path ' information for the atom inside the interferometer .",
    "this in turn requires that diffraction of atomic beams off of beam splitters , and their reflection off of mirrors be elastic and coherent . _ consequently , an atom can only change the centre - of - mass momentum of the beam splitters or mirrors , and can not deposit energy into them .",
    "_ since the mirrors and beam splitters of migo can be firmly mounted to the frame , the effects of this centre - of - mass momentum transfer can be minimized .",
    "a measure of the inelastic versus elastic components of these processes is based on the debye - waller factor @xmath202 through the intensity ratio @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the diffracted ( or reflected ) intensity and @xmath205 is the incident intensity .",
    "the factor @xmath202 is a measure of the fluctuations of the atoms in the crystal that diffracts the incident atomic beam . for diffracted atomic beams , @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the periodicity of the diffraction grating , and @xmath208 @xmath209 at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the rule of thumb @xcite is that @xmath210 , for sharp , elastic diffraction patterns to be seen .",
    "the requirement for observing interference is more stringent , however ; the probability of emitting even a single phonon during the diffraction process must be negligible , and @xmath211 is required @xcite . for nanofabricated diffraction grating and mirrors , @xmath212 at room temperature and decreases at lower temperatures .",
    "thus it is highly probable that the _ zero - phonon _ process is the dominant one , and therefore quantum phase coherence is expected in the interferometer .    as stringent as this zero - phonon - emission condition on atom interferometers may be ,",
    "atom interferometers of the same type as migo have been successfully constructed before .",
    "for example , the interferometer used by pritchard , which is very similar to the horizontal migo configurations , uses 1027 k sodium atom beams using 100 nm nanofabricated diffraction gratings .",
    "both the temperature of the atoms and the size of the diffraction gratings are comparable to migo s .",
    "the fact that fringes have already been observed in pritchard - type interferometers shows that decoherence due to the atom - beam - splitter interaction does not prevent interference from happening .",
    "the underlying advantages of migo over ligo or lisa go beyond being smaller and more sensitive .",
    "it is also possible to explore with migo general - relativistic effects that are not accessible with ligo .",
    "as we have outlined in the introduction , and have shown in figure @xmath213(b ) , the parallel transport of a four - vector around a closed path is a measure of the local riemann curvature tensor of the spacetime . referring to figure @xmath86 , and extending the @xmath98 paths that an atom can take into spacetime",
    ", it becomes clear that in migo the atom does _ precisely _ what is indicated in figure @xmath213(b ) : it is parallel transported around a closed path in spacetime , and as a result its phase is shifted by the local curvature of the spacetime @xcite through an anholonomy . although the delta - function impulsive forces in the mirrors impart an additional acceleration- and time - dependent phase shift to the atoms , the riemann - curvature - tensor contribution still remains , and will be dominant for low - frequency gws , and for stationary riemann curvature tensors in general .",
    "it is thus not surprising that migo is sensitive to the _ total _ local riemann curvature tensor of spacetime , independent of its source , and not just the fluctuations caused by the passage of a gw , as ligo is . indeed , while in our analysis in * appendix b * we have for clarity taken the acceleration due to gravity to be a constantthus neglecting the contribution of the curvature from stationary sources such as the earthif we repeat the analysis focusing now for stationary gravitational fields we find that the horizontal migo configuration will measure a phase shift @xcite @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the _ total _ local riemann curvature tensor from stationary sources ( once again the sagnac effect is neglected ) .",
    "the earth - based horizontal migo can thus measure @xmath216 s@xmath217 in a one second integration time . with a local curvature of @xmath218 s@xmath217",
    ", it will certainly be possible to measure the earth s riemann curvature tensor if the contribution from the sagnac effect can be subtracted from the signal independent of the earth s curvature s .",
    "it will also be able to measure the riemann curvature tensor of the sun ( @xmath219 s@xmath217 ) , and the moon ( @xmath220 , and a frequency of @xmath128 hz from a supernova source shown in figure @xmath173 has a rms @xmath221 s@xmath217 , similar to the nearly static riemann curvature of the sun and moon .",

    "is surprising .",
    "in general relativity , an atom is modelled as a spin - zero , point - like test particle , and thus should not be directly affected by the curvature .",

    "it should not be surprising that the riemann curvature of a _ curved base manifold _ will cause phase shifts as well , in a gravitational version of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .      the length of ligo s arms are such that @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the shortest wavelength of gws in ligo s frequency range .",
    "variations in the gw in space can then be neglected , and only variations in time matter , leading to eq .",
    "however , if the interferometer is _ larger _ than wavelength of the gw , general relativity predicts that additional terms that depend on the velocity of the particle as well as the _ spatial _ variation of the gwthe magnetic part of the weyl tensor of the gwwill now appear in eq .",
    "it is in principle possible to measure these new effects with migo ; at @xmath190 km , the length of the space - based migo is comparable to the wavelength of a gw with a frequency of roughly 3 khz .",
    "as can be seen in figure @xmath173 , there are a number of gw sources above this frequency that can potentially be used to probe these effects .",
    "in the first part of this paper , we have explored the implications , broadly speaking , of non - euclidean geometry for quantum physics .",
    "the problem of the interaction of gravitational radiation with quantum matter , including nonrelativistic quantum many - body - systems , was explored . in the second part of this paper",
    ", we have explored in detail one particular aspect of this problem , namely , the detection of astrophysical sources of the gws by means of matter - wave interferometry ( migo ) .",
    "our theoretical analysis indicates that in terms of sensitivity , size , capability , and flexibility , the _ quantum _ methods embodied in migo have overwhelming advantages over the _ classical _ methods embodied in ligo in studying general relativistic effects .",
    "what before took many kilometers can now be done in a couple hundred meters , and what took millions of kilometers can now be done with only thousands of meters .",
    "the impact of migo will go beyond simply being another astronomical instrument , however . with the advantage in migo that slowly moving atoms are predicted to have over ultrarelativistic ones",
    ", it will also spur theoretical and experimental studies that probe the intersection of _ nonrelativistic _ quantum mechanics with general relativity @xcite . as an example",
    ", we note that limitations to migo s sensitivity are , at their most fundamental level , imposed by quantum mechanics , and thus can not be exceeded .",
    "since migo in its essence measures local curvature , like wigner @xcite , we ask : what are the fundamental quantum limitations to the measurement of the riemann curvature tensor arising from the uncertainty principle ?",
    "this leads naturally to the age - old question , approached now from a different angle : what does it imply for einstein s theory of general relativity , and for geometry as a whole , if curvature can not be _ measured _ beyond these fundamental quantum limits ?",
    "this question , which , in order to answer , was once thought to require energy scales on the order of the planck energythe energy where general relativity and the other forces of nature are expected unifycan now be addressed using matter - wave interferometry , once the fundamental quantum limits to migo s sensitivity have been established .",

    "in general relativity , we require the theory to be invariant under _ general _ coordinate transformations .",
