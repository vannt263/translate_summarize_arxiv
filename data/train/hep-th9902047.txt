    "the action of @xmath0=4 four dimensional supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory was given for the first time in @xcite in the context of toroidal compactifications of the type i superstring .",
    "the theory has the maximal amount of supersymmetry allowed for a rigid supersymmetric theory in four dimensions , namely the symmetry generated by sixteen real supercharges , and has been proved to be finite , possessing a vanishing @xmath2-function .",
    "for this reason it has long been considered to be a rather trivial theory . however recent developments in the study of the correspondence with type iib superstring theory on anti de sitter space have shown that it is actually a very interesting quantum field theory , displaying very peculiar properties .",
    "the field content of the theory , which is unique apart from the choice of the gauge group g , consists of six real scalars , four weyl spinors and one vector , which are all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group g. in the abelian case the theory is free , whereas in the non abelian case it has a moduli space of vacua parameterized by the vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) of the six real scalars . in the coulomb phase , reached giving non vanishing vev s to the scalars in the cartan subalgebra of g , the theory is again free , while the origin of the moduli space corresponds to a highly non - trivial superconformal field theory .",
    "the model is classically invariant under the @xmath0=4 superconformal group and this property is supposed to be preserved at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "furthermore it has a global su(4)@xmath3so(6 ) symmetry , which naturally emerges in the compactification from ten dimensions on a six - torus and is identified , in a four dimensional perspective , with the r - symmetry group of automorphisms of the @xmath0=4 superconformal algebra @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0=4 super yang - mills theory is supposed to exactly realize a generalization of the electric - magnetic duality of montonen and olive @xcite ( s - duality ) , thanks to the presence in the spectrum of an infinite tower of stable bps dyonic states @xcite .    at the perturbative level",
    "the theory is finite up to three loops .",
    "the @xmath2-function has been shown to be vanishing both in the component formulation @xcite and using superspace techniques @xcite .",
    "in particular the formulation in terms of @xmath0=1 superfields has proved to be an extremely powerful tool in the perturbative analysis .",
    "strong arguments have been proposed in order to extend the proof of the finiteness to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite and moreover general considerations from instanton calculus and duality arguments suggest that the same should hold at the non - perturbative level @xcite .    following the proposal of maldacena @xcite of a correspondence relating ( super ) conformal field theories in @xmath4 dimensions and type iib superstring theory on @xmath4 + 1 anti de sitter space",
    "there has been recently a renewal of interest in @xmath0=4 supersymmetric yang  mills theory .",
    "according to this conjectured duality both perturbative @xcite and non - perturbative @xcite contributions to correlation functions of gauge invariant composite operators in @xmath0=4 super yang  mills theory should be related to type iib superstring amplitudes in ads@xmath5 .",
    "work in this context is leading to very interesting results in the study of peculiar properties of @xmath0=4 yang ",
    "mills theory as a superconformal field theory .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a careful re - analysis of perturbation theory , which allows to point out various problems related to the choice of gauge .",
    "both in the component field formulation and using @xmath0=1 superfields the gauge fixing procedure appears very subtle .",
    "as we will discuss in detail later , in both cases one finds ultraviolet and/or infrared divergences in off - shell green functions .    throughout the paper calculations",
    "will be carried out in euclidean space .",
    "two different formulations of the @xmath0=4 supersymmetric yang  mills theory will be employed , one in terms of @xmath0=1 superfields and the other in component ( ` physical ' ) fields .",
    "notations and conventions that will be used are those of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0=4 `` on - shell '' multiplet can be obtained by combining three @xmath0=1 chiral superfields and one @xmath0=1 vector superfield , so that the six real scalars of the model are assembled into three complex scalars which , together with three of the weyl spinors , form the chiral multiplets , the fourth spinor and the vector gives rise to the vector multiplet . in this description a su(3)@xmath6u(1 ) subgroup of the su(4 ) r - symmetry group is manifest . the component - field formulation that will be used",
    "is directly related to that in @xmath0=1 superspace , actually it is obtained from the former by integrating over the grassmannian coordinates of @xmath0=1 superspace .    in the component formulation",
    "the propagators of the elementary fields are ultraviolet divergent in the wess ",
    "zumino ( wz ) gauge and these infinities are exactly cancelled when the contributions of the ` gauge - dependent ' fields , that are put to zero in the wz gauge , are taken into account .",
    "the choice of the wz gauge , that is almost unavoidable in explicit computations , introduces divergences that require a wave function renormalization .",
    "different problems emerge in the formulation of the theory in terms of @xmath0=1 superfields .",
    "almost all of the calculations showing the vanishing of the quantum corrections to two- and three - point functions , that are presented in the literature , were performed in the supersymmetric generalization of the fermi  feynman gauge . with a different choice of gauge",
    "two- and three - point functions develop infrared singularities , leading to the result that the choice of the fermi  feynman gauge is somehow privileged .",
    "this conclusion was proposed for the first time in @xcite and then it was discussed in the case of the @xmath0=4 theory in @xcite ; however no possible explanation was proposed .",
    "unlike those of the elementary fields , correlation functions of gauge invariant composite operators , that play a crucial rle in the correspondence with ads type iib supergravity / superstring theory , should not suffer from problems related to the gauge fixing .",
    "we will also discuss , in the superfield formulation , the effect of introducing of a mass term for the ( anti ) chiral superfields , which breaks supersymmetry from @xmath0=4 down to @xmath0=1 .",
    "it is shown that this deformation of the model does not modify the ultraviolet properties of the original theory .",
    "this result was first proposed in @xcite , where it was proved that the inclusion of mass terms for the ( anti ) chiral superfields does not generate divergent corrections to the effective action .",
    "we will argue that this statement can be reinforced , showing that , at least at one loop , no new divergences , not even corresponding to wave function renormalizations , appear as a consequence of the addition of the mass terms .",
    "this result supports the claim put forward in @xcite , where the ` mass deformed ' @xmath0=4 theory was proposed as a supersymmetry - preserving regularization scheme for a class of @xmath0=1 theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ wzproblems ] deals with the problems introduced by the choice of the wess ",
    "zumino gauge when the component formalism is used .",
    "the following sections report calculations performed in the @xmath0=1 superfield formalism of two- , three- and four - point functions .",
    "a discussion of the results is presented in the concluding section .",
    "as already remarked the field content of @xmath0=4 super yang ",
    "mills theory can be obtained by coupling in a gauge invariant way one @xmath0=1 vector superfield @xmath7 and three chiral superfields @xmath8 , @xmath9 , all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group g , so that the colour index @xmath10 takes the values @xmath11 .",

    "this divergence will be cancelled by the contributions coming from the other one - loop diagrams involving @xmath13 and ghost internal lines .",
    "the argument given here reinforces the results of @xcite , at least at the one - loop level , and supports the proposal , put forward in @xcite , according to which the mass deformed @xmath0=4 model can be considered a consistent supersymmetry - preserving regularization for ( a class of ) @xmath0=1 theories .    notice that for the previous discussion it is not necessary to consider equal masses for all the ( anti ) chiral superfields .",
    "the same results can be proved giving different masses to the three superfields .",

    "feynman gauge the problem is not present because the choice @xmath98 gives a kinetic matrix of the form of equation ( [ kineticmatrices ] ) in the component expansion .",
    "the corresponding inverse matrix @xmath240 in ( [ inverskinmatr ] ) shows that no @xmath241 free propagator is present . on the contrary any choice @xmath145 produces such a propagator , _",
    "i.e.  _ gives a matrix @xmath240 with a non - vanishing @xmath242 entry , leading to the previously discussed infrared problem .",
    "an explicit calculation in components with @xmath145 and without fixing the wess ",
    "zumino gauge should display problematic infrared divergences analogous to those encountered here .",
    "these problems with infrared divergences are not peculiar of the @xmath0=4 super yang  mills theory , but appear in any supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "analogous infrared divergences in green functions have been observed in @xcite .",
    "the conclusion proposed in these papers is that there exist no way to remove the infrared divergences , so that the choice @xmath36=1 is somehow necessary , at least for the computation of gauge - dependent quantities .",
    "there are two general theorems concerning infrared divergences in quantum field theory .",
    "the first is the kinoshita ",
    "lee  nauenberg theorem @xcite , which deals with infrared divergences in cross sections .",
    "it states that no infrared problem is present in physical cross sections of a renormalizable quantum field theory , if the appropriate sums over degenerate initial and final states , associated with soft and collinear particles , are considered .",
    "the second theorem was proved by kinoshita , poggio and quinn @xcite and concerns green functions .",
    "the statement of the theorem is that the proper ( one - particle irreducible ) euclidean green functions with non - exceptional external momenta are free of infrared divergences in a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "a set of momenta @xmath243 , @xmath244 is said to be exceptional if any of the partial sums @xmath245 vanishes . the reason for the absence of divergences is that the external momenta , if non - exceptional , play the rle of an infrared regulator in the green functions .",
    "the proof of the theorem is based on dimensional analysis which does not work in the presence of a @xmath246 propagator . in particular",
    "it fails in the case of supersymmetric gauge theories in general gauges , because the adimensionality of the @xmath13 superfield implies that a propagator @xmath246 can appear in loop integrals .",
    "the apparent violation of the kinoshita  poggio ",
    "quinn theorem can be understood from the viewpoint of the component formulation : supersymmetric gauge theories , being non - polynomial and thus containing an infinite number of interaction terms , are not _ formally _ renormalizable .",
    "the choice of the wess ",
    "zumino gauge makes the theory polynomial .",
    "in fact in this case no infrared divergence is found in green functions and the general theorems are satisfied .",
    "however in the case of the @xmath247=4 theory the choice of the wz gauge results in a change of the ultraviolet properties of the model , at least for what concerns gauge dependent quantities , _ e.g. _ the propagators .    in theories with less supersymmetry ,",
    "in which ultraviolet divergences are present the problem might be less severe , since the subtraction of the ultraviolet infinities could also cure infrared singularities .",
    "the infrared problems discussed here are however gauge artifacts and can not affect gauge invariant quantities .",
    "the mechanism leading to the cancellation of infrared divergences in gauge independent green functions has not been verified in detail yet , but can be understood starting from the super feynman rules . when the propagator @xmath248 is inserted into a feynman graph it is connected to vertices which carry covariant derivatives .",
    "these derivatives come directly from the form of the action for vertices involving only @xmath13 fields and from the definition of the functional derivatives for vertices involving ( anti ) chiral superfields .",
    "the situation in diagrams for gauge invariant quantities is such that at least one covariant derivative can always be brought to act on the @xmath13 propagator by integrations by parts . in this way",
    "an additional factor of the momentum @xmath34 is generated in the numerator .",
    "more precisely for the infrared problematic term @xmath249 one gets @xmath250 = -4i\\frac{k_{\\mu}\\sigma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha{\\dot\\alpha}}}{k^{4 } }      { \\overline d}^{\\dot\\alpha}d^{2}\\ ] ] and @xmath251 = 4i\\frac{k_{\\mu}{\\overline \\sigma}^{\\mu{\\dot\\alpha}\\alpha } }      { k^{4 } } d_{\\alpha}{\\overline d}^{2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] a rigorous and general check of this mechanism in gauge invariant green functions has not been achieved yet .    with a gauge choice different from the fermi ",
    "feynman gauge the computation of four - point green functions is more complicated .",
    "single diagrams involving vector superfield propagators contain new contributions , some of which are infrared divergent .",
    "the correction @xmath128 is not zero anymore , because there are projection operators acting on the @xmath28-functions .",
    "moreover further diagrams must be included in the calculation of scattering amplitudes at the same order as a consequence of the non - vanishing of the one - loop correction to the propagators and vertices .",
    "for example one must consider diagrams such as        as well as diagrams obtained by the insertion of one - loop corrections to the propagators in tree graphs .",
    "notice that the inclusion of these contributions , each one separately infrared divergent , is fundamental in order to get a finite total cross section .",
    "the techniques illustrated in this paper for the calculation of green functions in the @xmath0=1 formalism can be applied to correlation functions of composite operators as well .",
    "green functions of gauge invariant composite operators such as those that form the multiplet of currents ( see @xcite for the explicit form of the multiplet in the abelian case ) play a crucial rle in the correspondence with type iib superstring theory on ads space . the application of @xmath0=1 superspace to this problem has not been considered here , but is under active investigation @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the extension of the formalism to the case of composite operators is in principle rather straightforward , the fundamental difference being that the complete green functions and not the proper parts must be considered .",
    "i am very grateful to massimo bianchi and giancarlo rossi for many useful discussions and for their comments on the manuscript .",
    "i also wish to thank claudio fusi , yassen stanev and kensuke yoshida for stimulating discussions ."
