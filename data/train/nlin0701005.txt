    "in the preceding publication @xcite we started our analysis of the interactions between dark solitons of the parametrically driven nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation : @xmath0 this equation arises in a wide variety of physical contexts ; see @xcite for references . in eq.([nls ] ) , @xmath1 is the strength of the parametric driving and @xmath2 is the damping coefficient . in the nondissipative limit , when @xmath3 , the equation has two coexisting stable soliton solutions , the bloch and the nel wall . in @xcite",
    ", we considered forces existing between two bloch walls and between two nel walls .",
    "the present work completes the analysis by classifying the nel - bloch interactions .",
    "the understanding of this nonsymmetric situation requires a mathematical formalism different from the one used in @xcite ; this justifies the need for a separate treatment .",
    "since the bloch wall does not exist for @xmath4 , we consider here the nondissipative case only .",
    "this is another distinction from ref.@xcite .",
    "our analysis of the interaction between bloch and nel walls will be based on the study of linearised perturbations about their ( unstable ) bound state .",
    "mathematically , this analysis reduces to the construction of eigenfunctions of a schrdinger - like operator , acting in the space of vector - functions , with the potential consisting of two well - separated nonidentical potential wells .",
    "when the two wells are infinitely far apart , there are four zero eigenvalues in its spectrum , with two associated eigenfunctions . as the wells ( produced by the bloch and nel walls ) are moved closer together , the degeneracy is partially lifted , with only two eigenvalues remaining at the origin .",
    "the question here is whether the two nonzero eigenvalues move onto the imaginary axis  which would be the case of stability , or onto the real axis  in which case the bound state is unstable .",
    "we use matched asymptotic expansions to show that the second is the case and construct eigenfunctions associated with the two real eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenfunction associated with the positive , unstable , eigenvalue contains the entire information on the character of interaction of two walls .",
    "we demonstrate that the outcome of the nel - bloch interaction depends on their left - right arrangement and the chirality of the bloch wall .",
    "a nel wall and a _ right_-handed bloch wall placed on its right will be moving in the same direction .",
    "if , however , we place a _ left_-handed bloch wall on the right of the nel , the two walls will move in opposite directions  towards or away from each other , depending on the initial perturbation .",
    "the right - handed bloch wall ( on the left ) and the nel wall ( on the right ) will move in opposite directions , while a pair involving the left - handed bloch on the left of the nel , will move colinearly .",
    "after the eigenfunctions associated with two opposite real eigenvalues have been constructed , the evolution of an arbitrary initial condition close to a pair of well separated bloch and nel walls is not difficult to predict . treating this initial condition as a perturbed bloch - nel bound state , its evolution",
    "will be determined by the projection of the perturbation on the bubble s unstable eigendirection .",
    "we illustrate this general approach by considering an example of initial condition in the form of a product of the bloch and nel wall .",
    "usually one tries to understand the interaction of solitons as interaction of point - like particles ; the particle description is physically appealing and mathematically lucid .",
    "we will show that a bloch and a nel wall _ can _ be treated as two classical particles .",
    "however the interaction between these two particles is anomalous in the sense that the bloch wall being attracted to the nel wall does not necessarily imply the reciprocal attraction of the nel to the bloch .",
    "this anomaly can be understood by considering the nel wall as a particle with negative mass .",
    "the  wrong \" mass sign arises very naturally if one recalls what the nel wall really is : a localised depression , a patch of low density moving over a high - density background .",
    "the only reason why this property was not fully appreciated before is because earlier studies focussed on symmetric , nel - nel , interactions  which are , of course , non - anomalous .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ bubbles ! ] we introduce _ travelling _ bloch and nel walls , and describe the bloch - nel bound state .",
    "section [ splitting ] contains the main mathematical result of this paper , the asymptotic analysis of the splitting of the degenerate zero eigenvalue . in the next section ( section [ interpretation ] ) we interpret the resulting eigenfunctions in terms of motions of the constituent walls . in section [ interaction ]",
    "we describe how the eigenfunctions can be used to classify the interaction of a pair of bloch and nel walls and apply this approach to a characteristic example .",
    "finally , the main results are summarised in section [ conclusions ] where we also interpret the interaction of the walls as interaction of opposite mass - sign particles .",
    "in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the undamped situation , @xmath3 . as in @xcite , we let @xmath5 with @xmath6 equation ( [ nls ] ) becomes @xmath7 this is the form of the parametrically driven nls that will be used in this paper .",
    "the stable background solutions of eq.([nls2 ] ) are @xmath8 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath9 .",
    "the two topological solitons of ( [ nls2 ] ) were introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "one is the nel wall @xcite : @xmath10 note that we are introducing the nel wall differently from @xcite , with an extra negative sign in front of the @xmath11 .",
    "this is done for later convenience .",
    "( in ref.@xcite , we would refer to the solution ( [ neel ] ) as an _",
    "antiwall_. )    the second topological soliton is the bloch wall @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 equation ( [ bloch ] ) with the positive sign in front of the imaginary part describes the right - handed bloch wall while in the case of the negative sign , the wall is said to be left - handed ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the nel wall exists for all @xmath9 whereas the bloch wall exists only for @xmath14 , i.e. for @xmath15 .",
    "since we are interested in the bloch - nel interaction , the latter will be our region of consideration .",
    "both the bloch and nel walls are stable in their entire regions of existence , @xmath15 and @xmath9 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the bloch and nel walls can be continued to nonzero velocity for all @xmath1  values for which they exist @xcite .",
    "the moving walls of the form @xmath16 are found as solutions of the ordinary differential equation @xmath17 the solution obtained by the continuation from the stationary nel wall @xmath18 , will be referred to as the  moving nel wall \" and denoted @xmath19 . in a similar way , the solution obtained by continuing @xmath20 in @xmath21 , will be called the  moving bloch wall \" ; to be denoted @xmath22 .",
    "the travelling walls are stable for all velocities @xmath21 @xcite .    an important characteristic of solutions of eq.([nls2 ] )",
    "is their field momentum : @xmath23 the momentum is conserved : @xmath24 .",
    "when we take the complex conjugate of @xmath25 , the associated momentum changes its sign : @xmath26=-p[\\psi]$ ] .",
    "consequently , the momenta of two stationary bloch walls with opposite chiralities are opposite .",
    "the right - handed bloch wall has negative momentum , while the left - handed wall s momentum is positive .",
    "the momentum of the stationary nel wall is , naturally , equal to zero .",
    "figure [ momentum_vs_v ] shows the momenta of stationary and travelling bloch and nel walls .",
    "these will be denoted @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively :    @xmath29 , \\label{yb } \\\\",

    "\\label{yn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to fig.[momentum_vs_v ] , when the right - handed bloch wall is continued into the region @xmath30 , it transforms into the moving nel wall . in a similar way , when we path - follow the left - handed bloch wall to large negative velocities , the corresponding branch turns into the branch of travelling nel walls .",
    "thus , the classification of moving solutions into bloch and nel walls is only sensible for sufficiently small @xmath21 ; for higher velocities , there is no qualitative difference between the two types of walls .",
    "one more observation with regard to fig.[momentum_vs_v ] concerns particle properties of the two walls .",
    "while the stationary bloch wall has positive mass , @xmath31 , the mass of the nel wall is negative : @xmath32 .",
    "this property will be crucial for the particle interpretation of the nel - bloch interaction ( section [ conclusions ] ) .",
    "in addition to the bloch and nel domain walls , eq.([nls2 ] ) possesses nontopological solitons .",
    "one such solution , arising for @xmath33 , is well known @xcite : @xmath34 recently , it has become clear that this solution is a member of a one - parameter family of solutions which exist for all @xmath35   @xcite . for each @xmath1 , this family has the following analytical expression :    [ family ] @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38    in eq.([family ] ) , @xmath39 is a sign factor : @xmath40 ; the exponents @xmath41 , @xmath42 are @xmath43 and @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 the solution ( [ family ] ) describes a bound state , or a complex , of a bloch and a nel wall , with the parameter @xmath46  characterising the distance between the centres of the two walls @xcite .",
    "the choice @xmath47  corresponds to the bloch wall on the right of the nel wall ; for @xmath48 , the bloch wall is on the left .",
    "the solution ( [ particular ] ) corresponds to @xmath49 ( and @xmath50 ) .",
    "the sign factor @xmath39  determines the chirality of the bloch wall bound in the complex : @xmath51  implies that the bloch wall is left - handed , while @xmath52identifies a complex with a right - handed bloch wall .",
    "eq.([family ] ) can also be interpreted as a bubble of one phase ( @xmath53 ) embedded in a background of a different phase ( @xmath54 ) ; we will frequently be referring to this solution as a `` bubble '' @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the bound state ( [ family ] ) will provide the understanding of the bloch - nel interaction .",
    "to study the stability of the bubble ( [ family ] ) , as well as to explore the phase space in the neighbourhood of this solution , we linearise eq.([nls2 ] ) in the small perturbation @xmath55 .",

    "we restrict our attention to the bound state with the nel wall on the left of the bloch wall [ @xmath69  in eq.([family ] ) ] . the results for @xmath70",
    "will be recovered by exploiting the symmetry @xmath71  of the solution ( [ family ] ) .",
    "since the dynamics described by equation ( [ nls2 ] ) are invariant under the reflection @xmath72 , the evolution of a bubble with @xmath73  will follow the same pattern as the evolution of the conjugate bubble with positive @xmath74 .    for all values of @xmath46 , the continuous spectrum of the operator",
    "@xmath62  lies on the imaginary axis , with @xmath75 , and does not give rise to instabilities .",
    "for @xmath76 , the separation of the bloch and nel wall in the bubble is infinite and so we have essentially two independent stationary ( but potentially mobile ) walls , each having two zero eigenvalues in its linearised spectrum .",
    "one of these stems from the translation invariance while the other one is associated with velocity boosts of the corresponding wall . for finite @xmath46 ,",
    "only two of the four zero eigenvalues remain in the spectrum : one pertaining to the translation invariance of the complex as a whole and the other one associated with variations of the interwall separation . in this section",
    "we compute , perturbatively , the arising _ nonzero _ eigenvalues ( and hence classify the stability of the bubble ) .",
    "we also construct the eigenfunctions associated with the real eigenvalues  these will provide insight into the evolution of the unstable bound state and nearby initial conditions .    the lifting of the degeneracy of a repeated eigenvalue of the scalar schrdinger operator with the potential comprising two identical potential wells with large separation , is discussed in the classical textbook @xcite .",
    "this analysis is not helpful in our case , unfortunately , for three reasons : ( i ) our @xmath77 operates on vector , not scalar , functions ; ( ii ) the potential wells formed by the bloch and nel walls are not identical ; ( iii ) the analysis in @xcite _ postulates _ a particular form of the wavefunction on symmetry grounds , rather than deriving it within some perturbation formalism  as a result , the generalisation to the vector nonsymmetric case is not straightforward .    our treatment will be based on expanding the eigenfunction in the asymptotic series near the cores of the two walls and matching the resulting expansions in the overlap region @xmath78 .",
    "this approach builds on the asymptotic procedure used for the study of the stability of the travelling dark soliton @xcite .",
    "we will do all our calculations for the case @xmath47 ( i.e. for the bloch wall on the right of the nel wall ) .",
    "furthermore , we will restrict ourselves to the right - handed bloch wall only ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the other three possible combinations of @xmath39 and @xmath80 will be commented upon at the end of section [ splitting ] .",

    "indeed , the eigenfunction should include a term growing as @xmath124 and representing the tail of the bloch wall situated in the region @xmath126 .",
