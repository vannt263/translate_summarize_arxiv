    "let us consider a random vector @xmath0 with joint cumulative distribution function @xmath1 and marginal distribution functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the sklar s theorem ( see @xcite ) says that there exists a bivariate distribution function @xmath4 on @xmath5 ^ 2 $ ] with uniform margins such that    @xmath6    the function @xmath4 is called a copula associated with the random vector @xmath7 . if the marginal distribution functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 of @xmath1 are continuous , then the copula @xmath4 is unique and is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 $ ] , are the generalized inverses of @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . + from these facts , estimating bivariate distribution function can be achieved in two steps : ( i ) estimating the margins @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; ( ii ) estimating the copula @xmath4 .",

    "our approach , based on modern functional theory of empirical processes , allows the use of data - driven bandwidths for this estimator , and is largely inspired by the works of mason @xcite and deheuvels and mason @xcite .",
    "+ there are two main methods for estimating copula functions : parametric and nonparametric methods . the maximum likelihood estimation method ( mle ) and the moment method are popular parametric approaches .",
    "it happens that one may use a nonparametric approach like the mle - method and , at the same time , estimates margins by using parametric methods .",
    "such an approach is called a semi - parametric estimation method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a popular nonparametric method is the kernel smoothing .",
    "scaillet and fermanian @xcite presented the kernel smoothing method to estimate bivariate copulas for time series .",
    "genest and rivest @xcite gave a nonparametric empirical distribution method to estimate bivariate archimedean copulas .",
    "+ a pure nonparametric estimation of copulas treats both the copula and the margins in a parameter - free way and thus offers the greatest generality .",
    "nonparametric estimation of copulas goes back to deheuvels @xcite who proposed an estimator based on a multivariate empirical distribution function and on its empirical marginals .",
    "weak convergence studies of this estimator can be found in fermanian et al .",
    "gijbels and mielniczuk @xcite proposed a kernel estimator for a bivariate copula density .",
    "another approach of kernel estimation is to directly estimate a copula function as explored in @xcite .",
    "chen and huang @xcite proposed a new bivariate kernel copula estimator by using local linear kernels and a simple mathematical correction that removes the boundary bias .",
    "they also derived the bias and the variance of their estimator , which reveal that the kernel smoothing produces a second order reduction in both the variance and mean square error as compared with the unsmoothed empirical estimator of deheuvels @xcite .",
    "+ omelka , gijbels and veraverbeke @xcite proposed improved _ shrinked _ versions of the estimators of gijbels and mielniczuk @xcite and chen and huang @xcite .",
    "they have done this shrinkage by including a weight function that removes the corner bias problem .",
    "they also established weak convergence for all newly - proposed estimators .",

    "we ll apply these recent methods to kernel - type estimators of copulas .",
    "the existence of kernel - type function estimators should lead to nonparametric estimation by confidence bands , as shown in @xcite , where general asymptotic simultaneous confidence bands are established for the density and the regression function curves .",
    "furthermore , to our knowledge , there are not yet such type of results in nonparametric estimation of copulas .",
    "this motivated us to extend such technologies to kernel estimation of copulas by providing asymptotic simultaneous optimal confidence bands .",
    "let @xmath15 be an independent and identically distributed sample of the bivariate random vector @xmath7 , with continuous marginal cumulative distribution function @xmath2 and @xmath3 . to construct their estimator , chen and huang proceed in two steps . in the first step , they estimate margins by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are some bandwidths and @xmath19 is the integral of a symmetric bounded kernel function @xmath20 supported on @xmath21 $ ] . in the second step ,",
    "the pseudo - observations @xmath22 and @xmath23 are used to estimate the joint distribution function of the unobserved @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which gives the estimate of the unknown copula @xmath4 . to prevent boundary bias ,",
    "chen and huang suggested using a local linear version of the kernel @xmath20 given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 for @xmath28 ; @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 is a bandwidth . finally , the local linear kernel estimator of the copula @xmath4 is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 the subscript @xmath33 in @xmath34 is a variable bandwidth which may depend either on the sample data or the location @xmath35 . +",
    "our best achievement is the construction of asymptotic confidence bands from a uniform in bandwidth law of the iterated logarithm ( lil ) for the maximal deviation of the local linear estimator , and the uniform convergence of the bias to zero with the same speed of convergence .",
