    "here i solve directly in minkowsky space the mass gap equation for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath0sb ) .",
    "s@xmath0sb was introduced by the original work of nambu and jona - lasinio @xcite , and it is presently accepted to occur in hadronic physics , where it generates a constituent mass for the quarks .",
    "s@xmath0sb also implies the partially conserved axial current theorems @xcite , including a small mass for the pion . in the literature the mass gap equation",
    "is usually solved either in equal time @xcite or in euclidean space @xcite , in order to avoid the poles and complex quantities which are expected in full minkowsky calculations .",
    "recently the scientific community has been exploring different approaches to the minkowsky space @xcite . an exact solution in minkowsky space",
    "will test the quality of the aproximate solutions .",
    "moreover a solution in minkowsky space opens wider applications .",
    "for instance the bethe salpeter amplitudes can be computed on the mass shell momentum @xmath1 , and at the same token it is possible to boost the hadrons to any convenient frame . in this paper",
    "an analytical approach is applied to finite and analytic kernel . for simplicity",
    "the infrared or ultraviolet divergences are not addressed here .",
    "although a complete solution can only be achieved numerically , an interesting insight is nevertheless presented by the analytical approach .    in the schwinger - dyson formalism truncated at the rainbow level ,",
    "the mass gap equation is , @xmath2 for the quark - quark interaction i consider the class of kernels that can be decomposed in a class of yukawa potentials , which is finite both in the ultraviolet and infrared limits , @xmath3 to ensure that the kernels are finite in the ultraviolet limit of large @xmath4 i assume that @xmath5 , since this implies that the kernel vanishes at least like @xmath6^{-2}$ ] . in the infrared limit",
    "the kernels are finite when the @xmath7 are finite , or when infrared cancellations occur . the class of kernels defined in eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) is quite general , for instance it includes the coulomb interaction regularized by a pauli - villars term .",
    "it also includes the fourier transform of the confining linear potential , @xmath8 and of the linear potential with a negative infinite shift @xmath9 which are both obtained in the limit of vanishing @xmath10 . using finite differences , the derivatives in @xmath10 can be decomposed in the class of potentials of eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) .",
    "the class of kernels addressed in this paper is not only general , it is also covariant , analytical and forward propagating , and this is convenient to study the mass gap equation in minkowsky space .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking occurs when a non - vanishing mass is dynamically generated . for clarity",
    "let us also assume that @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) .",
    "this approximation is qualitatively acceptable when the kernel is finite @xcite .",
    "computing @xmath12 is not difficult , but it obscures the result of the paper . then the mass gap equation is a single non - linear and integral equation for @xmath13 , @xmath14 where all dirac and colour algebraic factors are absorbed in the coupling constants @xmath15 of the potential @xmath16 . the chiral limit of vanishing current quark mass ( the mass in the free quark propagator ) @xmath17 , is also assumed .",
    "this is particularly interesting because it applies to the physics of the quarks @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the technical difficulties reside in the multiple integral with poles and complex quantities and in the non - linearity of the self - consistent equation .",

    "standard approximations are applied to the the rainbow schwinger - dyson , and the need to perform a calculation in minkowsky space is motivated . in section",
    "[ one loop ] the integral in the mass gap equation is computed analytically in the case where the quark mass is assumed to be constant .",
    "the solution of the minkowsky non - linear integral mass gap equation is addressed in section [ non - linear ] . finally in section",
    "[ conclusion ] the results and conclusion are presented .",
    "in the literature the mass gap equation is usually solved either in equal time @xcite or in euclidean space @xcite . in the equal time approximation , the lorentz invariance is lost .",
    "the space and time components of physical constants , say @xmath21 or @xmath22 may differ @xcite .",
    "moreover it is not clear how to boost the hadrons outside the centre of mass frame . in the euclidean approximation",
    "it is not clear if a simple wick rotation @xmath23 is exact because there may exist poles in the path ot the @xmath24 axis .",
    "moreover it is very hard to rotate back to minkowsky with the inverse rotation @xmath25 when only a numerical expression of the dynamical mass is known .",
    "this is connected to the topological problem of discretising a curved surface .",
    "although these two methods are approximate , they are used in the literature because they are fully consistent with dynamical symmetry breaking , providing the same approximation is also used in the bound state equations @xcite . at the same token these methods avoid the technical problem of addressing poles and complex quantities , which are expected in minkowsky space . by providing a solution of the mass gap equation , both lorentz invariant and in minkowsky space , both the equal time and the euclidean time approximations",
    "may be better understood . here",
    "the approximate methods for solving the schwinger - dyson equation are reviewed .    in the instantaneous or equal time approximation , it is assumed that the dependence in @xmath24 and in @xmath26 is irrelevant in the kernel of the mass gap equation .",

    ". here the approximation consists in only considering the positive energy poles of the propagators .",
    "for simplicity i consider here a single yukawa term , @xmath38 then the integral in @xmath26 produces , @xmath39 the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and the fermion mass @xmath42 can be included in the boson creation vertex , @xmath43 then the mass gap equation is equivalent to a coupled channel hamiltonian equation , where the one fermion channel is coupled to the fermion plus boson channel by the boson creation and annihilation vertices , @xmath44 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\phi_f \\\\ \\phi_{f , b } \\end{array } \\right ) = 0 \\ .\\ ] ] reducing the equation by substitution of the fermion plus boson wave - function , the secular equation is , @xmath45 \\phi(p ) = 0 \\ , \\label{mge secular}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it is clear that when @xmath46 , the threshold for a boson production is open .",
    "this produces a cut in the function @xmath47 , with an imaginary component for the mass .",
    "actually more cuts appear when the energy is further increased , and the system couples to to 1 fermion and 2 bosons , 1 fermion and 3 bosons ... therefore expect cusps and imaginary components are expected to appear when @xmath48 , @xmath49 ...    when the mass gap equation is solved in the minkowsky space , then all the features of the three different approaches of eqs .",
    "( [ mge instantaneous ] ) , ( [ mge euclidean ] ) and ( [ mge secular ] ) are expected to appear .",
    "non - trivial solutions of the mass gap equation , and imaginary masses above thresholds are expected .",
    "moreover it will be interesting to study the effect of the negative energy components on eigenvalues .",
    "as a first approach to the minkowsky integral , i assume a real constant mass @xmath42 and compute analytically the integral of eq.([mass equation ] ) . this can be regarded a one loop approximation to the mass gap equation , in the sense that the correct solution can be obtained iteratively , in an infinite loop calculation .",
    "the analytical result may also be eventually used to remove poles form the numerical iterative program . in this sense",
    "i choose to perform the multiple integrals in the same ordering that may be used in a numerical integration . a first attempt to start by an analytical integral of the three angular integrals",
    "( both trigonometric and hyperbolic ) was abandoned because the result was indeterminate .",
    "therefore the two angular integrations of the three dimensional space are first performed , in order to simplify the kernel . finally the double integration in the temporal @xmath26 and in the spatial @xmath50 are performed .",
    "the main aim of this section is the covariant study of the positive @xmath51 case which was not accessible to the approximate approaches .",

    "here the mass gap equation is solved in an analytical one loop approximation . the standard method to solve the mass gap equation ( [ mass equation ] )",

    "i consider a constant @xmath77 , which allows the analytical computation of the integral in eq .",

    "however these further iterative steps would probably need a numerical computation , since the function @xmath80 is already a complicated one .",
    "therefore , in this analytical approach , i choose to stop at the second step of the iteration .",
    "to minimise the error of this one loop computation , i demand that the mass @xmath80 coincides with the mass @xmath77 at the mass shell momentum @xmath81 , @xmath82 this is equivalent to assume that the mass dependence of the integral in eq .",
