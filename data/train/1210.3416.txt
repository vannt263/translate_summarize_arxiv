    "one of the goals of the inverse scattering problem is to identify unknown properties ( e.g. , the shapes , material properties , locations , and constitutions ) of electromagnetic targets from measured scattered field data .",
    "this problem is generally solved by newton - type iteration schemes or level - set method involving minimization of the difference between the measured scattered data and the computed data by generating an admissible cost functional .",
    "related works can be found in @xcite and references therein . to execute these schemes ,",
    "the frchet derivative must be evaluated at each iteration step , so the computational costs are large .",
    "unfortunately , non - convergence or the appearance of several minima arises in the iteration procedure owing to the non - convex nature of the cost functional .",
    "furthermore , _ a priori _ information on unknown targets is essential to guarantee a successful reconstruction , and even when the above conditions are fulfilled , reconstruction will fail if the iteration process is begun with a bad initial guess .",
    "hence , generating a good initial guess close to the expected conditions is a priority . for this purpose ,",
    "alternative non - iterative imaging algorithms such as the linear sampling method , single- and multi - frequency based kirchhoff and subspace migrations , and the topological derivative strategy have been developed .    in pioneering research @xcite ,",
    "the multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm has been investigated to find the locations of point - like scatterers .",
    "it was recently applied to various problems , for example , detection of antipersonnel mines buried in the ground @xcite , searching for the locations of small inclusions @xcite , identifying internal corrosion in a pipeline @xcite , and shape reconstruction of arbitrarily shaped thin inclusions , cracks , and extended targets @xcite .",
    "on the basis of these results , the locations of small inclusions can be accurately identified using music , but owing to the intrinsic resolution limit , the complete shape of extended targets can not be imaged .",
    "hence , the obtained results were based on good initial guesses , and iteration - based algorithms such as the level - set method were successfully executed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although the music algorithm offers good results for small and extended targets , a detailed structural analysis must be attempted because some phenomena can not be explained using the traditional approach , for example , the unexpected appearance of artifacts or of two curves along the boundary of targets instead of the true shape ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 9(b ) ) ) , or an image with poor resolution ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.4 ) ) .",
    "numerical results in existing works motivate us to explore some properties of the music - type algorithm for imaging the arbitrarily shaped thin penetrable electromagnetic inclusions and perfectly conducting cracks considered in @xcite .",
    "our exploration is based on the rigorously derived asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of a thin inclusion @xcite and physical factorization of the so - called multistatic response ( msr ) matrix @xcite . with this",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] ,",

    "<S> the main purpose of this paper is to study the structure of the well - known non - iterative multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm for identifying the shape of extended electromagnetic inclusions of small thickness located in a two - dimensional homogeneous space . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a relationship between the music - type imaging functional for thin inclusions and the bessel function of integer order of the first kind . </S>",
    "<S> our construction is based on the structure of the left singular vectors of the collected multistatic response matrix whose elements are the measured far - field pattern and the asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of thin inclusions . </S>",
    "<S> some numerical examples are shown to support the constructed music structure . </S>"
