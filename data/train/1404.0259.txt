    "after the observation of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of @xmath0cr @xcite , @xmath2dy @xcite , and @xmath3er @xcite atoms with large magnetic dipolar interaction , there has been renewed activity in the theoretical and experimental studies of degenerate gases . the atomic interaction in usual nondipolar atoms",
    "is taken as an isotropic @xmath4-wave contact interaction .",
    "the dipolar interaction , on the other hand , is anisotropic , long - range , and nonlocal acting in all partial waves . due to the anisotropic nonlocal nature of dipolar interaction ,",
    "the stability of a dipolar bec depends on the number of atoms , the strength of dipolar interaction , the scattering length , as well as , reasonably strongly and distinctly , on the trap geometry @xcite . among the novel features noted in a dipolar bec",

    "_ @xcite predicted the dynamical trapping of a _ repulsive _ cigar - shaped bec in one of the wells of a double - well potential using a simple two - mode description of the wave function for repulsive nonlinearity beyond a critical value and for an initial population imbalance between the two wells .",
    "this is counter - intuitive as a repulsive bec is expected to expand and occupy both the wells equally .",
    "the phenomenon of self trapping , appearing due to the self - interaction of a bec , and of josephson oscillation have been studied extensively in nondipolar becs @xcite .",
    "there have also been studies of josephson oscillation and self trapping of a dipolar bec in a double well @xcite and in a toroidal trap @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study self trapping in a cigar - shaped dipolar bec in a double well , aligned along the polarization direction , in the presence of an anisotropic nonlocal dipolar and a repulsive contact interaction .",
    "the bec is subject to a strong radial and weak axial trap and we use a reduced one - dimensional ( 1d ) model for the description of its dynamics @xcite .",
    "we consider a large enough value of scattering length @xmath1 , so that the net self - interaction in the dipolar bec is repulsive .",

    "set - up has been used and the role of self - interaction in dipolar bec is well understood in this configuration . for this reason we shall consider the polarization direction along the axial symmetry direction in this study . although , we shall not study self trapping in a fully anisotropic dipolar bec , we shall make qualitative remarks about expected results in such cases .    in the thoroughly studied dipolar bec of @xmath0cr atoms ,",
    "the strength of the repulsive contact interaction is stronger than the dipolar interaction so that the net interaction is repulsive and is suitable for the study of self trapping .",
    "the same is not obvious in a strongly dipolar @xmath2dy bec , where the net interaction could be attractive to make the system unsuitable for self trapping .",
    "this is why we consider the interaction parameters of @xmath0cr atoms in this study .",
    "moreover , it is possible to manipulate the scattering length to a lower value by the feshbach resonance technique @xcite , to make the dipolar bec barely repulsive for studying the interplay of contact and dipolar interactions in self trapping .    in this study of self trapping of a cigar - shaped repulsive dipolar bec in a double - well potential ,",
    "the following general trend is established . the total number of atoms @xmath5 and the initial population imbalance @xmath6 play decisive roles in self trapping , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the initial number of atoms in the two wells : @xmath9 .",
    "for an initial population imbalance @xmath10 greater than a critical value @xmath11 there is self trapping for @xmath5 beyond a critical number @xmath12 consistent with the prediction of the two - mode description @xcite . for @xmath13 ,",
    "there is josephson oscillation for all @xmath5 . for @xmath14 , there is josephson oscillation for @xmath15 and self trapping for @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an upper limit of @xmath5 for self trapping .",
