    "the fact that three active neutrinos possess non - degenerate but tiny masses is a striking signature of new physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most popular approach towards understanding the small neutrino mass scale ( @xmath2 ev ) is the seesaw mechanism @xcite , which contains three right - handed neutrinos and retains @xmath3 gauge symmetry .",
    "although this mechanism can naturally work at a superhigh - energy scale ( @xmath4 gev ) to generate tiny majorana neutrino masses , it loses direct testability on the experimental side and causes a hierarchy problem on the theoretical side @xcite .",
    "a straightforward way out is to lower the seesaw scale down to the tev scale , an energy frontier to be soon explored by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "but such a tev - scale seesaw scenario inevitably suffers from a terrible fine - tuning of cancellations between the yukawa coupling texture and the heavy majorana mass matrix @xcite . to resolve this unnaturalness problem built in the canonical (",
    "type - i ) seesaw mechanism at low energies , some new interest has recently been paid to a relatively old idea  the inverse seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the inverse seesaw mechanism , which can be regarded as the simplest multiple seesaw picture @xcite , is an extension of the canonical seesaw mechanism by introducing three additional gauge - singlet neutrinos together with one gauge - singlet scalar .",
    "its typical result for the effective mass matrix of three active neutrinos is @xmath5 in the leading - order approximation , where the scales of three mass matrices may naturally satisfy @xmath6 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath7 can be attributed to both the smallness of @xmath8 and the smallness of @xmath9 at the tev scale ( i.e. , @xmath10 tev ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to get a balance between theoretical naturalness and experimental testability of the inverse seesaw scheme .",
    "nevertheless , the inverse seesaw mechanism itself is impossible to interpret the observed pattern of neutrino mixing , which is composed of two large angles ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and one small angle ( @xmath13 ) @xcite , because the flavor structures of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath8 are entirely unspecified .",
    "the latter can be determined by imposing certain flavor symmetries , but such flavor symmetries usually need to be broken in order to give rise to the correct neutrino mass spectrum and neutrino mixing pattern .",
    "for example , a proper combination of the @xmath16 flavor symmetry and the inverse seesaw mechanism at the tev scale @xcite may successfully predict the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern @xcite ( with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , which is definitely consistent with current experimental data on solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillations .",
    "the present work aims to combine the inverse seesaw mechanism with a newly - proposed flavor symmetry  the friedberg - lee ( fl ) symmetry @xcite , so as to fix the flavor textures of @xmath20 , @xmath15 and @xmath8 and thus predict the mass spectrum and mixing pattern of three active neutrinos at the tev scale .",
    "as the fl symmetry requires a fermion mass term to be invariant under a space - time - independent translation of the relevant fermion fields , it can more reasonably be applied to the gauge - singlet neutrino sector instead of the active neutrino sector .",
    "we show that the fl symmetry forces one pair of the gauge - singlet neutrinos to be massless , leading to a simplified but viable version of the inverse seesaw mechanism which has two pairs of massive gauge - singlet neutrinos and allows one active neutrino to be massless . with the help of @xmath0-@xmath1 permutation symmetry",
    ", we consider a very simple fl symmetry breaking ansatz in the gauge - singlet neutrino sector and obtain the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern by means of the inverse seesaw relation .",
    "we find that non - unitary corrections to this special mixing pattern are possible to reach the percent level if @xmath21 holds at the tev scale .",
    "we also demonstrate that a soft breaking of @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetry can easily accommodate cp violation in such an inverse seesaw scenario .",
    "let us work in the basis where the flavor eigenstates of three charged leptons are identified with their mass eigenstates throughout this paper .",
    "different from the canonical seesaw mechanism with three right - handed neutrinos @xmath22 ( for @xmath23 ) , the inverse seesaw scheme contains three additional gauge - singlet neutrinos @xmath24 ( for @xmath23 ) together with one gauge - singlet scalar @xmath25 . allowing for lepton number violation to a certain extent",
    ", one can write out the following gauge - invariant neutrino mass terms in the inverse seesaw mechanism : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand respectively for the @xmath29 lepton and higgs doublets , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the @xmath32 yukawa coupling matrices , and @xmath8 is a symmetric majorana mass matrix . after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , eq .",
    "( 1 ) becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the @xmath32 mass matrices .",
    "then we arrive at the overall @xmath36 neutrino mass matrix @xmath37 in the flavor basis defined by @xmath38 and their charge - conjugate states : @xmath39 note that the interesting nearest - neighbor - interaction pattern of @xmath37 is guaranteed by an implementation of the global @xmath40 symmetry with a proper charge assignment @xcite .",
    "note also that the mass scales of three sub - matrices in @xmath37 may naturally have a hierarchy @xmath41 , because the second mass term in @xmath42 is not subject to the @xmath29 gauge symmetry breaking scale and the third mass term in @xmath43 violates the lepton number conservation @xcite . in the leading - order approximation , one obtains the inverse seesaw relation for the effective mass matrix of three active neutrinos : @xmath44 it becomes obvious that @xmath45 holds in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , @xmath47 ev can easily be achieved from @xmath48 and @xmath49 kev .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let us work in a basis where @xmath31 ( or equivalently , @xmath14 ) is diagonal ; i.e. , @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( for @xmath23 ) being real and positive .",
    "now we impose the fl translation @xcite on both @xmath53 and @xmath54 fields : @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( for @xmath23 ) are in general complex numbers , and @xmath57 is a space - time - independent grassmann parameter ( i.e. , @xmath57 is anti - commuting and thus @xmath58 holds ) .",
    "note that the gauge - singlet neutrinos @xmath22 and @xmath24 do not interact with the gauge bosons of the standard model .",
    "note also that the kinetic terms of @xmath59 and @xmath24 change under the above translation , but the resulting action is invariant just because @xmath57 is independent of space and time @xcite .",
    "hence the whole lagrangian of an inverse seesaw model will be invariant under the fl translation , if and only if we require three neutrino mass terms in @xmath60 to be invariant under the fl translation .",
    "this requirement simply implies @xmath61 for @xmath62 . in other words ,",
    "each mass matrix must have a zero eigenvalue . because @xmath31 is diagonal",
    ", we may simply choose @xmath63 or equivalently @xmath64 such that @xmath65 and @xmath66 must hold to satisfy the second and third conditions given in eq .",
    "this in turn implies that the elements in the third column of @xmath30 and those in the third row and the third column of @xmath8 must be vanishing , so as to satisfy the first , fourth and fifth conditions shown in eq .",
    "the textures of @xmath30 and @xmath8 are therefore given as @xmath67 in this case , the symmetric @xmath68 neutrino mass matrix @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be simplified to an effective @xmath70 neutrino mass matrix @xmath71 where ",
    "@xmath72 \" symbolically denotes an arbitrary ( non - zero ) matrix element . because @xmath73 holds , one active neutrino must be massless in this minimal inverse seesaw scenario .",
    "the phenomenology of such a simple scenario has partly been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we show that the fl symmetry applied to the gauge - singlet neutrino sector naturally explains why a pair of gauge - singlet neutrinos can be decoupled from the usual inverse seesaw mechanism .",
    "it is worth remarking that the above conclusion does not depend on the chosen basis of @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath31 is diagonal ) , since a unitary transformation of either @xmath53 or @xmath54 does not change any physical content of the inverse seesaw mechanism . to derive a phenomenologically - favored neutrino mixing pattern from this interesting scheme , however , it is more convenient to introduce a less stringent fl symmetry into the gauge - singlet neutrino sector . here",
    "we consider the case of @xmath74 , which is equivalent to the original fl translation ( imposed on @xmath75 @xcite ) . then",
    "three mass terms in @xmath43 can keep invariant under the translations @xmath76 and @xmath77 if they take the following forms : @xmath78 where the greek index runs over @xmath79 and the latin index runs over @xmath80 .",
    "the explicit expressions of @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath8 turn out to be @xmath81 in which all the matrix elements are in general complex .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath82 holds , and thus each mass matrix has one zero eigenvalue .",
