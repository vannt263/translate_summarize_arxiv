    "these models are extensions of the shankar - murthy model , and were discussed earlier by hamm @xcite and hoever @xcite .",
    "the random couplings are not always ferromagnetic . as we shall see below , in these models one encounters computation of the lyapunov exponent of a product of random non - diagonal matrices to determine the location of a phase transition .",

    "[ fig : honeycomb ] , the honeycomb lattice is equivalent to the brick lattice .",
    "we write the ising spin sitting on each lattice point of the brick lattice as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 label vertical and horizontal positions respectively .",

    "same as the brick lattice , we assume that the interactions on the vertical bonds are uniform . regarding the horizontal bonds , however , we assume that the interactions are random in the adjoining two bonds and form an alternating order , and besides they are independent in different rows .",
    "an instance of the configuration of interactions is depicted in fig .",

    "<S> two - dimensional ising models on the honeycomb lattice and the square lattice with striped random impurities are studied to obtain their phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> assuming bimodal distributions of the random impurities where all the non - zero couplings have the same magnitude , exact critical values for the fraction @xmath0 of ferromagnetic bonds at the zero - temperature ( @xmath1 ) are obtained . </S>",
