    "ultra - luminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources are point like , off - nuclear extra galactic sources with observed luminosities greater than the eddington limit for a @xmath2 black hole ( bh ) , with @xmath3@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the true nature of these objects is still open to debate @xcite .",
    "one fundamental issue is whether the emission is isotropic or beamed along our line - of - sight .",
    "a possible scenario for geometrical beaming involves super - eddington accretion during phases of thermal - timescale mass transfer @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the emission is isotropic and the eddington limit is not violated , ulx must be fuelled by accretion onto intermediate - mass bh ( imbh ) , with masses in the range 100 - 10000 @xmath5 @xcite . of course , it is possible that some ulx appear very luminous due to a combination of moderately high mass , mild beaming and mild super - eddington emission .",
    "it is also possible that ulx are an inhomogeneous population , comprised of both a subsample of imbh and moderately beamed stellar mass black holes @xcite .",
    "( also named cxou j095550.2 + 694047 ) is one of the brightest ulx in the sky .",
    "the host galaxy is located nearby , at a distance of 3.6mpc @xcite , making , with an average x - ray luminosity @xmath6@xmath4 , an excellent target for the detailed modelling of the x - ray spectrum in such objects .",
    "is one of the few ulx for which ( 10 - 200mhz ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) have been found @xcite and is the prototype ulx with curved x - ray spectra .",
    "@xcite analyzed the _",
    "spectrum of this source ( with an energy coverage extending up to to 20kev ) and tested the data to a variety of models , confirming that this source has a spectrum curved at high - energies .",
    "@xcite analyzed the longest _ xmm - newton _ observations available in the archive and applied models of diffuse thermal emission from the galaxy to understand the high - energy curvature of the spectrum .",
    "the authors found that the high energy curvature could indeed be explained by the presence of a third thermal component having very high column densities ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) .",
    "this contradicts recent _ chandra _ observations by @xcite , who found column densities of @xmath9@xmath8 , in fitting the x - ray spectra at the position of this ulx .    as in the case of black hole binaries ( bhbs ) ,",
    "some ulxs undergo spectral transitions from a power - law dominated state to a `` high - soft '' state ( see e.g. mcclintock & remillard for a description of the spectral states in bhbs ) . during the power - law state the high - energy spectra of ulxs is inferred to have a power - law spectral shape in the 3 - 8kev spectral range , together with a high - energy turn - over , and a soft - excess ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". this soft - energy excess can be modelled by emission coming from the inner - accretion disc and is characterized by a low disc temperature of @xmath10kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "if these observed characteristics are entirely due to a bh accreting at sub - eddington rates , they imply the presence of an imbh with @xmath11@xmath5 . in the case of , due to the huge absorption at soft x - rays by the host galaxy , this soft x - ray excess is not observed in the spectra .",
    "systematic studies of the highest quality xmm - newton ulx spectra by @xcite and @xcite have shown that the majority of ulxs display a break / turnover at high energies ( @xmath12 kev ) .",
    "such breaks are not commonly seen in the spectra of bhbs .",
    "@xcite argue that this turnover could be due to comptonization from an optically thick corona , which would shroud the inner regions of the accretion disc and artificially lower the inner temperatures obtained from simple spectral modelling . under such interpretation",
    "most ulxs would then represent a new accretion state for stellar - mass bhbs .",
    "an alternative explanation is proposed by @xcite , where the authors note that in many cases the turnover occurs between 57 kev , and could be due to a combination of the iron @xmath13 emission line and absorption edge ( 6.4 and 7.1 kev respectively for neutral iron ) in a relativistically blurred reflection spectrum from the inner accretion disc of a spinning black hole .",
    "here reflection refers to the back - scattering and fluorescence of x - rays @xcite . under this interpretation",
    ", the soft excess emission often assumed to come directly from the accretion disc is also due to blurred reflection , meaning that the disc emission is not directly observed .",
    "other explanations have also been proposed , often based on emission from the aforementioned slim discs in which advection of radiation from the inner regions of the accretion disc reduces the observed luminosity ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) . in the case of ,",
    "the huge intrinsic column density of the galaxy ( @xmath14@xmath8 ) , makes the detection of soft x - ray spectral features from this source very unlikely .",
    "here we use the best publicly available data from _ suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton _ , currently being the best available x - ray data from this source .",
    "our goal is to disentangle both the emission from the host galaxy and the intrinsic spectrum from the source ( section [ spec_anal ] ) and to analyze the latter with current models used for the description of the spectra from ulxs ( section [ spec_anal2 ] ) .",
    "we notice the presence of a broad fe k line in the residuals and explore its significance in section [ spec_anal3 ] .",
    "eventually , physical implications are discussed in section [ discuss ] .",
    "in this work , we consider the longest publicly available _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn spectra from  ( obs . ids : 0112290201 and 0206080101 ) .",
    "the source was very bright , with a count rate of @xmath15 .",
    "the datasets were obtained through the _ xmm - newton _ public data archive .",
    "the epic - pn camera has a higher effective area than the epic - mos cameras , and drives the results of any joint spectral analysis . the reduction and analysis reported in this work used sas version 9.0.0 .",
    "we checked for pile - up in all the observations and found that this was not significant ( i.e. it is @xmath16 for the high energy channels ) for both observations .    in table",
    "[ log_obs ] we present a log of the observations .",
    "we applied the standard time and flare filtering ( rejecting high - background periods of rate @xmath17counts / s , as recommended for the pn camera ) .",
    "we filtered the event files , selecting only the best - calibrated events ( pattern@xmath18 for the pn ) , and rejecting flagged events ( flag@xmath19 ) .",
    "for each exposure , we extracted the flux from a circular region on the source ( centre at coordinates @xmath20deg , @xmath21deg and radius @xmath22arcsec ) .",
    "the background was extracted from a circular region , not far from the source and away from boundaries of the chips and the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "we built response functions with the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "we fitted the background - subtracted spectra with standard models in xspec 12.5.0 @xcite .",
    "all errors quoted in this work are @xmath23 confidence errors . for the spectral",
    "fitting we used the 0.510kev range .",
    "the resulting spectra were grouped with the ftool grppha to bins with a minimum of 20 counts each .      was observed with  ( @xcite ) on three occasions in 2005 october 4 , 19 and 27 for approximately 32 , 40 and 28  respectively .",
    "the four operating detectors constituting the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; koyama et al .",
    "2007 ) were operated in the `` normal '' clock mode in all observations . in all cases ,",
    "the detectors were operated in both the 3x3 and 5x5 editing modes .",
    "a total ( co - added ) front - illuminated ( fi ) exposure of approximately 96 , 110 and 80  were obtained for the three respective observations .",
    "the corresponding back - illuminated ( bi ) exposures were approximately 32 , 37 and 27 . using the latest software package we processed the unfiltered event files for each of the  ccds and editing modes operational in the respective observations , following the  data reduction guide .",
    "we started by creating new cleaned event files by re - running the  pipeline with the latest calibration , as well as the associated screening criteria files .",
    "was used to extract spectral products from these event files . in all observations ,",
    "source events were extracted from a circular region of 180  radius centred on the point source , and background spectra from another region of the same size , devoid of any obvious contaminating emission , elsewhere on the same chip . the script `` xisresp '' with the `` medium '' input was used to obtain individual ancillary response files ( arfs ) and redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) .",
    "`` xisresp '' calls the tools `` xisrmfgen '' and `` xissimarfgen '' . finally , we combined the spectra and response files from the three front - illuminated instruments ( xis0 , 2 and xis3 ) using the  .",
    "this procedure was repeated for each observation resulting in a total of six xis spectra . after inspecting that there were no significant spectral differences between the three observations we further co -",
    "added the various front and back - illuminated spectra .",
    "this resulted in a total good exposure of approximately 280 and 92  for the front and back - illuminated spectrum respectively .",
    "finally , the  was used to give at least 20 counts per spectral bin . the two  spectra was fit in the 1.510.0   energy range with the 1.72.1  energy range being ignored due to the possible presence of un - modeled instrumental features .    for the hard x - ray detector ( , @xcite )",
    "we again reprocessed the unfiltered event files for the respective observations following the data reduction guide ( only the  data is used in this analyses ) . since the  is a collimating rather than an imaging instrument , estimating the background requires individual consideration of the non x - ray instrumental background ( nxb ) and cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "the appropriate response and nxb files were downloaded for the respective observations ; in each case the tuned ( model d ) background was used .",
    "common good time intervals were obtained with  which combines the good times of the event and background files , and  was used to extract spectral products .",
    "dead time corrections were applied with , and the exposures of the nxb spectra were increased by a factor of ten , as instructed by the data reduction guide .",
    "the contribution from the cxb was simulated using the form of @xcite , with the appropriate normalisation for the nominal pointing ( all observations were performed with  nominal pointing ) , resulting in a cxb rate of @xmath24 .",
    "the nxb and cxb spectra were then combined using  to give a total background spectrum , to which a 2% systematic uncertainty was added .",
    "similarly to the  data , we co - added all three  observations and grouped the final spectrum to have a minimum of 500 counts per energy bin to improve statistics , and again allow the use of @xmath25 minimization during spectral fitting .",
    "the  data reduction yielded a total ( co - added ) source rate of @xmath26  which is 2.5% of the total observed flux , with a good exposure time of @xmath27 .",

    "the results of the previous section with feasible models for the continuum leave some positive residuals in the 67kev energy range in the _ suzaku_/xis spectrum of obs . 3 ( see left panel of figure [ plots_laor2 ] ) .",
    "these residuals could not be accounted for by the addition of the narrow fe line and indicate the likely presence of a broad fe emission feature . to analyze this possibility",
    "further , we added a broad gaussian line to the best fit model ( described in the previous sections ) of obs .",
    "3 .    the addition of a gaussian centred at 6.46.97kev in the best model describing the spectrum of obs .",
    "3 improves significantly the quality of the fit with any of the models used to describe the hard ( @xmath29kev ) x - ray spectra ( improvement of @xmath30 for @xmath31 additional degrees of freedom for disc and comptonization models , respectively ) .",
    "this means a @xmath32 detection , which means a f - test probability of @xmath33 that the improvement occurs by chance with any of both models .",
    "the line is broad ( @xmath34kev ) and the derived equivalent width ( ew ) of the line is of @xmath35ev for the disc and the comptonization models , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the value of the equivalent width of the line is significantly different from zero and that it is model - independent .",
    "thus , we can consider the detection of the broad fe line as a robust one , which does not depend upon the model considered for the continuum . in the right panel of figure [ plots_laor2 ]",
    "we plot both the broad fe line and the best description used for the underlying continuum .          as shown above the presence of a broad fe line",
    "is significant in the _ suzaku _ spectrum ( obs .",
    "the equivalent - width is in the range 3080ev , in agreement with findings for some active galactic nuclei , and it does not depend on the model applied for the continuum ( disc emission or comptonization models ) .",
    "accretion models predict that fluorescence lines broadened by relativistic effects could arise from reflection of x - ray emission onto the inner region of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole . in order to derive the inner disc radius and inclination we fitted the spectrum of obs .",
    "3 with a relativistic disc line profile calculated in a maximally spinning kerr space - time ( laor model in xspec ; @xcite ) but with the inner radius allowed to vary .",
    "we froze the emissivity index of the power - law emission and the outer radius to @xmath36 and @xmath37@xmath38 , thus canonical values in bh - accreting systems .",
    "the inner disc radius was found to be @xmath39@xmath38 ( values corresponding to the disc and comptonization models , respectively , for the continuum ) .",
    "this value is comparable to or even larger than the innermost stable circular orbit of a non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) bh ( i.e. @xmath40 ) .",
    "the inner disc inclination was found to be very small , too ( @xmath41@xmath42 ) , thus implying a close face - on configuration . adding this line supposed an improvement in the fit of @xmath43 for @xmath44 additional degrees of freedom for disc and comptonization models , respectively , thus very similar to the case of the inclusion of the broad gaussian .",
    "in the present work we have studied the best broad - band x - ray spectra of currently available in x - rays from _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ satellites . with these high - quality data we have been able to disentangle emission from the diffuse plasma of the galaxy and intrinsic emission from the ulx .",
    "our results imply that the x - ray diffuse emission is composed by a two - temperature thermal emission from a hot plasma in multi - phase state .",
    "similar temperatures of the components ( @xmath45kev ) have been found for the highest s / n _ asca _ spectra of nearby elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of the source obtained with _",
    "suzaku _ is significantly curved and properly accounted by models with intrinsic curvature ( either emission from the inner accretion disc or comptonization from cold electrons in an optically thick corona ) , in agreement with previous studies .",
    "but the most important result of this paper is that the ( very ) high quality observation with _",
    "suzaku _ has allowed us to detect a significant broad fe k@xmath1 line in the spectrum of this notorious ulx .",
    "assuming that the line feature is solely coming from the ulx via disc fluorescence , and that the inner radius reaches the last stable orbit , the data rules out a rapidly spinning bh and favours a non - spinning schwarzschild - bh .",
    "previous studies ( @xcite ) have suggested that the bh in this ulx is rapidly rotating but the possibility of a non - spinning bh has not been rejected so far .",
    "the obtained equivalent width ( ew ) is in the range 3080ev .",
    "this value for the ew ( in obs .",
    "3 ) is notoriously lower than the tentative value previously reported ( ew=0.260.43kev ; @xcite ) for the spectrum of obs .",
    "1 . with the application of our model for the diffuse emission and the continuum of the source",
    ", we do not detect any fe line in the same dataset of their work ( obs .",
    "we have found that in the _ suzaku _ spectrum this line is broad and the ew is similar to typical values found for the broad fe k line in a wide sample of agn @xcite .",
    "the value we found for the ew is significantly smaller than those found in the typical cases of claimed relativistic lines ( e.g. , @xmath46ev in mcg63015 ; @xcite ) , for which an extremely fast rotating kerr - bh has been claimed .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies are setting much lower values @xcite for the spin of this agn , underlying in the fact that the continuum was poorly modelled .",
    "in the previous work of analysis of the _ suzaku _ spectrum by @xcite the broad fe line was described by the addition of several narrow lines .",
    "this hypothesis looks reasonable , since a similar complex has been clearly seen in our galactic centre @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of relativistically broad fe lines seems to be common in all types of accreting compact objects ( neutron stars , bhb , agn ) and evidence of their finding in ulxs would be very helpful in the understanding of the real physical processes accounting in these sources .",
    "future longer x - ray observations will certainly provide further insights into the fe complex and the presence of additional reflection features for this archetype of the ulx class .",
