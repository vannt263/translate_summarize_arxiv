    "the casimir effect @xcite has been under intense experimental scrutiny over the last ten years , since the landmark experiment of lamoreaux @xcite , and has been experimentally well established in different setups .",
    "a very interesting property of the effect is that it can be either attractive or repulsive , depending sensitively on the boundary conditions , geometry and topology of the background under study @xcite",
    ". it would be desirable to have some physical understanding on what , exactly , are the conditions for the effect to be one or the other .",
    "in particular because a repulsive casimir effect may have many interesting applications , as for example , to quantum levitation @xcite .",
    "however such understanding does not exist at present time .",
    "the issue of a repulsive casimir effect is particularly timely in the context of gravitational physics , since repulsive gravity seems to be dominating our universe at present times @xcite .",
    "moreover , repulsive gravity is required to power an early inflationary epoch ( see @xcite for an example of casimir induced inflation ) and might play a role in avoiding the big bang singularity , through a bounce ( see @xcite for an example of a casimir induced bounce ) .",
    "thus , any quantum effects that might produce repulsive gravity are of interest , and the casimir effect is an experimentally confirmed one .",
    "the effect has also great relevance in the context of kaluza - klein theories , where the compactness of the extra dimensions confines any quantum field , and hence produces a casimir force that tends to make the extra dimensions perturbatively unstable ( as was first argued by appelquist and chodos @xcite ) . in general",
    "it seems very hard to find kaluza - klein type configurations with compact dimensions which are stable under quantum effects ( see @xcite , section 10 ) , without invoking supersymmetry .",
    "by the same principle , if our universe has a compact topology , as in a @xmath4 frw cosmological model or in @xmath5 cosmological models with identifications , the casimir effect will induce a force for any quantum field .    given the lack of general understanding concerning the sign of the casimir force",
    ", one might consider families of models and examine the change in character of the casimir force as one varies continuous or discrete parameters . within this spirit",
    "we study the casimir effect of a scalar field , @xmath6 , with arbitrary mass @xmath7 and arbitrary coupling @xmath8 to the ricci scalar of the background on an @xmath0-dimensional einstein static universe ( esu ) @xmath9 of radius @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the model under study is a 4-parameter family , labelled by one discrete , @xmath2 , and three continuous parameters , @xmath11.-dimensional spheres include @xcite ( see also @xcite , chapter 9 ) for a scalar field with @xmath2-dimensional spherical dirichlet boundary conditions and @xcite ( chapter 10 and references therein ) for a scalar field in a kaluza - klein setup of type @xmath12 . ]",
    "we will present closed expressions for the renormalised energy density @xmath13 and pressure @xmath14 , as functions of the aforementioned parameters .",
    "these are obtained through a generic regularisation procedure , which can , effectively , be connected to several well known methods such as point splitting , `` momentum '' cut - off , zeta function and different types of damping functions , including the one discussed in @xcite .",
    "the mathematical manipulations are done by using the abel - plana formula .",
    "let us note that special cases of our analysis have been performed in the literature .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite considers the @xmath15 case and conformal coupling ; ref .",
    "@xcite considers general @xmath2 , but only conformal coupling and zero mass . in both cases",
    "the results in these references agree with ours . in the first case ,",
    "a self consistent einstein static universe is found , taking into account the quantum effect ; we find similar solutions ( see section 4 ) . in the second case ,",
    "our computation reproduces the result of @xcite in the appropriate limit ( see ( [ rhooddconf ] ) and discussion thereafter ) .    besides the intrinsic interest in understanding the behaviour of the casimir force on a @xmath16-dimensional einstein static universe we will be also interested in a particular physical application",
    "it is well known that esus are , classically , perturbatively unstable towards radial perturbations .",
    "one may then ask if the extra casimir force induced by the quantum field could give rise to stable equilibrium radii . to tackle this question one should use the semi - classical einstein equations @xmath17 which yield the higher dimensional friedmann and raychaudhuri equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) =  , [ cosmo1]with the subscript ` cla ' denoting the classical quantity , and = -^2  , [ cosmo2]where @xmath18 and ^(n)^(n)+p^(n )  .",
    "[ sigma ] thus , in this paper , we will focus our analysis on the renormalised quantities @xmath13 and",

    "we will examine in detail the dynamics of and .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the theory under study , the unrenormalised quantities and the renormalisation technique .",
    "we are then led to equations - , which are the main technical results in this paper . to gain insight about these very generic expressions",
    "we analyse their behaviour in section 3 , by presenting numerical plots . in section 4",
    "we present a summary of our results and observe that equilibrium radii exist , even including the quantum contribution ; we also suggest the possible existence of _ stable _ equilibrium radii based on the results herein and and , an issue to be studied more thoroughly in @xcite . in the appendices we discuss some technicalities used in this paper and show how the general regularisation scheme used makes contact with commonly used regularisation methods ( point - splitting , `` momentum '' cut - off and zeta function ) .",
    "we will deal with a simplified model containing the gravitational field , @xmath21 , and a real scalar field , @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that we are at sufficiently low energy so that these are the only dynamically relevant entities which emerge from a full theory , by integration of any other ( more massive ) degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the low energy effective action considered herein contains all possible combinations of these fields as allowed by the surviving symmetries .",
    "the coefficient of each term is unknown , a priory , and arises from the full theory .",
    "however we can still make some considerations about magnitudes by identifying the relevant scales in the full theory and in the problem at hand .",
    "the two scales to be considered are the planck length ( which is assumed to be the fundamental scale in the full theory ) and the largest length scale ( or lowest energy scale ) in the limit we are studying .",
    "all other dimensionful parameters in the problem should be in between .",
    "we denote the former by @xmath22 and the latter by @xmath10 .",
    "the most general lorentz invariant effective action containing @xmath23 and @xmath6 in ( @xmath2 + 1 ) dimensions will be given by , @xmath24 where all lengths are measured in units of @xmath10 ( which is why they are denoted with a tilde ) and the fields have also been redefined in units of the appropriate quantity constructed from @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath25 denotes an arbitrary tensor operator constructed from @xmath6 and its derivatives , with ( mass ) dimension @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is an arbitrary tensor constructed from the metric and its derivatives , with dimension @xmath28 .",

    "if all scales in the fundamental theory are of the same order as the planck scale , then the @xmath34 are of order @xmath22 .",
    "however , more realistically we should expect other larger scales at smaller energies .",
    "these may be generated by the dynamics of the theory or some intrinsic symmetry .",
    "thus , some of the @xmath31 s may be of the same order as @xmath10 .    to proceed",
    "we assume that only a finite number of terms in expansion survive at low energies and that all higher order terms are suppressed .",
    "therefore we must decide , in advance , a given order for truncation .",
    "once we have chosen such an order , we must include all operators up to the corresponding mass dimension .",
    "all the coefficients are then low energy parameters to be fixed by experiment",
    ". then we can go on to analyse the quantum dynamics of the fluctuations of the fields .",
    "when doing so , we have to keep in mind that @xcite :    1 .",
    "the high energy contributions to any observable , must be suitably regularised in a way that does not affect the low energy physics .",
    "2 .   any quantity which can be eliminated by a redefinition of the low energy parameters ( @xmath35 )",
    "must be discarded .",
    "any contribution which is of higher order in @xmath36 than the chosen order for truncation , must be discarded .",
    "consider a scalar field @xmath6 , with mass @xmath7 coupled only to gravity ( i.e. with no self coupling or equivalently potential ) , through the ricci scalar , @xmath37 , of a curved space - time .",
    "the scalar field part of the theory is described by the action    [ general_action2 ] _ = d^n+1x ( -_^-^2 ^ 2-^2 )  .",
    "these are all the possible operators with mass dimension up to @xmath0 , which couple to gravity , contain no self coupling and that will contribute in our model . indeed , the only remaining possible operators are of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is some constant . by a field redefinition",
    "these can be exchanged by operators of the form @xmath40 and others which are purely gravitational .",
    "the latter may be absorbed in a redefinition of the gravitational couplings in ; the former will not contribute to the scalar field equation of motion in our model , since all curvature invariants will be constants .",
    "we shall further assume that all other higher order operators are suppressed by powers of @xmath36 ( which is equivalent to consider that all corresponding @xmath41 s are of order @xmath22 ) .",
    "analogously for pure gravity we must consider all gravitational operators up to that same order of truncation @xmath42 ( c.f . )",
    ". therefore the action for gravity is , _",
    "g_=d^n+1x(-2++_p=2^[(n+1)/2]^(p)^(2p ) ) [ action3 ]  , where @xmath43 $ ] denotes integer part .",
    "note that all gravitational operators are of even dimension . on dimensional grounds , from",
    ", we expect all terms in ( [ action3 ] ) which are of quadratic ( or higher ) order in the curvature to be heavily suppressed by powers of the planck mass ( if we assume a single fundamental scale for gravity ) .",
    "however , for consistency , we still have to include them in our effective theory , because they may get renormalised , even though we can neglect them for the purpose of looking at the evolution equations for the radius of the universe at scales where the effective theory holds .",

    "we now define a regularisation prescription for the energy density based on very weak and physically well motivated assumptions .",
    "this will allow us to separate and analyse the divergent and finite contributions . by using the first law of thermodynamics we",
    "can then obtain the regularised pressure and therefore the full regularised energy momentum tensor . in section [ red ] , all the divergences and finite contributions which scale with the background radius @xmath10 in the same way as the various gravitational terms will be subtracted , renormalising the corresponding couplings .    to regularise the energy density we need to suppress the high energy modes .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a regulator , which should actually arise naturally from the fundamental theory by integrating out the massive degrees of freedom ; but our ignorance about such theory implies that the way in which this regulator fundamentally arises is unknown . besides suppressing the high energy ( or momentum ) contributions to physical observables , the regulator leads to a cutoff dependence in the bare couplings of our effective theory .",
    "but if this theory is to give a good low energy description , the infrared physics will be regulator independent , so such dependence is assumed to cancel when we renormalise the bare couplings    we assume that , in the fundamental theory , there is a natural length scale @xmath65 which acts as regularisation parameter ( @xmath66 is a typical length scale in our model and @xmath67 will turn out to be a very small dimensionless number ) .",
    "in addition we can introduce other dimensionless parameters , @xmath68 , which could , for instance , control the form of the regulator before it is removed ; alternatively they could be associated with ratios of other length scales in the problem .",
    "a realisation of the former possibility will be seen in appendix [ mcutoff ] .",
    "thus , on dimensional grounds , a general regularised energy density which could arise from the fundamental theory is ^(n)_=_=0^+d^(n)_^(n)_g(l^(n)_,_i )  .",
    "[ firstreg ] the physical condition that the infrared physics should be regulator independent , amounts to say that the regularising function @xmath69 , introduced in , stays close to 1 for a wide range of energies around zero .",
    "this is equivalent to say that for sufficiently small energies @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes a variation with energy and @xmath72 a differentiation with respect to the first argument of @xmath69 .",
    "hence , to a very good approximation @xmath73 thus , an order 1 rescaling of @xmath67 will not affect the low energy physics ; this will turn out to be an important condition used in the isolation of the divergences , which is not surprising since @xmath67 is to some extent arbitrary and any arbitrariness must be absorbed together with the divergences .    in what follows , any remaining dimensionless parameters",
    "@xmath68 will not affect the reasoning so they are omitted ; we therefore write ^(n)_=_=0^+d^(n)_^(n)_g(l^(n ) _ )  .[reged0 ] one way to interpret this formula is that only the energy spectrum is distorted .",
    "this is physically reasonable since the background is taken to be fixed and thus the scalar field could still be expanded in hyper - spherical harmonics , so @xmath74 should still be a good quantum number .",
    "this type of regularisation is therefore consistent with spacetime symmetries",
    ". we will confirm it for the special case of point splitting regularisation in appendix [ pointsplit ] .",
    "it might seem that simply introduces a damping function .",
    "it is certainly true that any damping function regularisation is of this form .",
    "but we will make the point that , if we leave the dimensionless function @xmath69 unspecified - and we will obtain the renormalised energy density without specifying @xmath69 - , effectively includes a much broader class of regularisations .",
    "indeed , as shown in appendix [ commonmethods ] for the special case of point - splitting , it will become clear that @xmath69 does not even have to be a _ damping _ function ; it might simply oscillate with increasing @xmath75 without ever decreasing its modulus .",
    "since we expect @xmath65 to be of the order of the planck length and @xmath66 is of the order of the typical length scales in our problem ( which are either @xmath10 or @xmath76 ) , @xmath67 should indeed be very small , which justifies taking @xmath67 to zero to identify the divergences .",
    "in fact , we will not have to set it to zero , since all cutoff dependent contributions will explicitly take a form which is readily absorbed in low energy couplings . the same will hold for all regularisations considered in appendix [ commonmethods ] , independently of any other extra parameters @xmath68 controlling the form of the regulator .",

    "it is interesting to note that , by using a very generic regulator , we obtained almost all possible divergences .",

    "also interesting is the fact that we can accommodate theories with special symmetries which forbid some higher curvature terms in the gravitational lagrangian , by choosing regulators which integrate some of the divergences to zero ( or very close ) .",

    "the renormalised energy density is then obtained taking the limit @xmath306 and using the analytic continuation of the appropriate zeta function . in many cases",
    "the result is immediately finite ; the analytic continuation of the zeta function `` swallows '' the divergences .",
    "but it might happen that the analytic continuation of the zeta function has poles at @xmath307 , in which case one needs to discuss the surviving divergences . as an example we consider below @xmath2 odd and generalise the method applied in @xcite , which uses the epstein - hurwitz zeta function , to treat the case with @xmath308 .",
    "the regularised expression can , alternatively , be treated as a special case of the general treatment in section 2.4 . to do that with the single parameter @xmath67 used",

    "the function @xmath69 becomes a damping function to which the treatment in section 2 can be readily applied ; the results therein follow .",
    "the typical procedure in zeta function or dimensional ) regularisation is analytical continuation .",
    "the latter often hides the divergences and their physical interpretation as we have emphasised . for completeness",

    "the last term in is divergent , due to the poles of the gamma function .",
    "it should be dropped out and understood as a renormalisation of the gravitational couplings of all the terms in , except the cosmological constant .",
    "this illustrates how different renormalisation methods give rise to different renormalisation of physical quantities , since with a damping function method of the type used in @xcite only the cosmological constant gets renormalised ( a result that generalises for arbitrary odd @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the different uv completions of the theory obtained from different regularisation methods .",
    "but for a renormalisable theory the finite contribution should be independent of the regularisation method , which is what we are obtaining here .    subtracting these infinite contributions one obtains the renormalised energy density . in the special case of the 3-sphere it reduces to the result obtained in @xcite , where it was shown that it coincides with the result obtained with a damping function method . that yields , in general , the same result as the one obtained before with our more generic regularisation scheme can now be checked numerically , case by case , which we have done for the 5-sphere and 7-sphere .",
    "finally let us mention that , for @xmath46 and conformal coupling , we have checked that the analytic continuation of the hurwitz zeta function yields .",
    "in this appendix we simplify the integral @xmath322 which appears in , leading to the expressions in and .",
    "first consider the complex variable @xmath323 .",
    "the integral @xmath324 becomes the contour integral i=_c_1dz+_c_2dz  , [ i ] where the paths of integration are exhibited in figure [ path0 ] .",
    "we will deform these contours of integration into closed contours enclosing regions wherein the integrands are analytic functions .",
    "an application of cauchy s theorem then yields the integral @xmath324 in terms of the integrals along the remaining paths of the closed contours providing a manifestly real expression for @xmath324 . to do this rewrite @xmath325 given in as @xmath326 where @xmath327 is given by ( [ pt ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to analyse separately the cases with @xmath104 non - negative and negative respectively .",
    "note that we will implicitly use the fact that the regulator is analytical . for convenience",

    "these are all compensated by    the zeros of the numerators , except for the one at @xmath333 .",
    "therefore the integrands have a simple pole at @xmath333 .",
    "moreover , we have branch cuts as @xmath334 ,    @xmath335 , which are induced by    the branch cut of @xmath336 at    @xmath337 .",
