    "we obtain 3.5  @xmath131 for @xmath1sm and 2.2  @xmath131 for @xmath2sm .",
    "the difference of a factor 10 between the results for @xmath1sm can be understood by the fact that in ref .",

    "[ fig : compar ] there seems to be a small odd - even effect in the strength of the pygmy resonance @xmath132 .",

    "the level density and the @xmath0-strength function have been extracted experimentally for @xmath1sm and @xmath2sm .",
    "the level density of the samarium nuclei is smaller than for the mid - shell dysprosium , erbium and ytterbium nuclei investigated earlier . from the level densities thermo - dynamical quantities such as temperature and heat capacity were found .",
    "structures in the micro - canonical temperature are interpreted as the onset of new degrees of freedom by the breaking of cooper pairs .",
    "the s - shape in the heat capacity curves , found within the canonical ensemble , indicates the pairing - phase transition , and a critical temperature for the quenching of pair correlations is found .",
    "the s - shape in the heat capacity curve is slightly more pronounced in the odd @xmath2sm nuclei , the opposite of what has been observed in the well deformed nuclei , where the even isotopes exhibit more pronounced s - shapes than the odd isotopes .    for the total @xmath0-spectra of the @xmath1sm and @xmath2sm nuclei , from excitation energy at the neutron binding energy , there is very good agreement between the neutron capture data from the @xmath34sm(n,@xmath0)@xmath1sm and @xmath1sm(n,@xmath0)@xmath2sm reactions and the same spectrum calculated from the @xmath0-strength functions and level densities extracted from the present @xmath1sm(@xmath8he,@xmath9)@xmath2sm and @xmath1sm(@xmath8he,@xmath8he)@xmath1sm data .",
    "the interpretation of the fine structure of the @xmath0-strength functions is still an open question , since there are no experimental data to determine if the multipolarity of the pygmy resonance is of @xmath48 or @xmath47 nature .",
    "if it turns out to be @xmath48 , the resonance at @xmath126  3  mev in the @xmath0-strength function is likely to be interpreted as due to the scissors mode built on exited states .    for the first time we compare our data to the ( n,@xmath0 )",
    "gedr data and the @xmath1sm @xmath0-strength function seems to give a consistent extrapolation down to lower @xmath0-energies .",
    "the tail of the gedr was until now not very well known and has been modeled in several ways , and our experimental data will assist the theoretical effort to describe the shape of this tail .",
