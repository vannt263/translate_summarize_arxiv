    "the main objective of the theory of open quantum systems is to develop a comprehensive description of various kind of interactions of the system with its ambient environment and their effect on the dynamics of the system of interest @xcite .",
    "any realistic quantum system is bound to get affected by its environment and therefore the dynamical features of open quantum systems are particularly important from the practical perspective . due to the advent of quantum technologies such as quantum communication @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite ,",
    "there has been an upsurge of interest in the application of several techniques of open quantum systems .",
    "markovian dynamics of open systems have been extensively studied and implemented successfully in a wide variety of problems @xcite .",
    "+ however , due to impressive developments in the experimentation with quantum systems and their control @xcite , it has been realized that open quantum systems do not generally behave within the domain of markovian dynamics @xcite . particularly for the case of systems constituting more than one interacting systems ,",
    "where the interactions between the parties may be comparable to the interaction strength of the coupling to the bath , it is natural for the dynamics to deviate from markovian behavior @xcite .",
    "a number of measures of this deviation from markovianity have been proposed recently , where  non - markovianity \" is recognized as the departure from monotonic behavior of certain measures under strictly markovian dynamics @xcite . generally , a quantitative measure , which shows monotonic behavior under markovian dynamics is addressed and departure from that monotonicity is taken to be a signature of non - markovianity .",
    "for example , we can consider the dynamics of entanglement in an open system scenario . since local trace preserving completely positive maps do not increase the amount of entanglement , evidently it can be surmised that the entanglement with an ancillary system decays monotonically within markovian regime .",
    "thus , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of entanglement was used as a signature to identify the non - markovian characteristics of a system - environment interaction .",
    "+ in recent times , the theory of quantum coherence as a resource has attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "coherence plays a central role in quantum mechanics enabling operations or tasks which are impossible within the regime of classical mechanics .",
    "coherence underlies the non - classical behavior of a quantum system , like entanglement . in ref .",
    "@xcite several measures , like the @xmath0 norm and the relative entropy were introduced to characterize the coherence of a quantum system .",
    "the valid measures of coherence should not increase under allowed incoherent operations .",
    "based on this , it can be inferred that the measures of quantum coherence are monotone under markovian dynamics .",
    "hence any deviation from the montonicity of coherence measure can also be taken as a signature of deviation from markovian dynamics @xcite .",
    "the central theme of our work revolves around this specific issue of the dynamical behavior of coherence monotones under a specific system - environment interaction which is not strictly markovian .",
    "usually for the case of markovian dynamics of a composite system , the environment acts locally on each of the parties . for the bipartite case , considered here",
    ", the environment is globally interacting with the system .",
    "this enables us to consider two parts of the non - unitary evolution .",
    "one is of course the local lindbladian and the other is an interactive part which is essentially causing the deviation from markovian evolution .",
    "here we have taken a two qubit atomic system interacting with a harmonic oscillator bath .",
    "a similar model with a squeezed thermal bath has been studied earlier for estimating the entanglement dynamics of the atomic system @xcite .",
    "based on the above mentioned model , the first part of our work is to present an analytical estimation of the dynamics of coherence , for the purpose of characterization of the deviation from monotonicity and to find the conditions under which such deviation occurs .",

    "+ next , we consider the dynamics of quantum fisher information .",
    "the fisher information is a measure of intrinsic accuracy in statistical ensemble theory @xcite .",
    "quantum generalization of the fisher information has also been introduced @xcite , which can be considered as a measure of non - classicality for quantum system @xcite .",
    "we establish a direct relation between quantum fisher information and coherence in the system for a special class of two qubit density matrices .",
    "this is expected because non - classicality of a quantum system must be directly related to its inherent coherence .",
    "we will also study the dynamics of the fisher information , indicating the effect of the interactive part of the non - unitary evolution .",
    "a comparison between the dynamics of coherence , entanglement and fisher information will be made in order to find which is more sensitive to non - markovian dynamics in the given scenario .",
    "then , we will extend our study by considering the memory effect of environmental interaction .",
    "we will use a non - markovian noise model to generalize the global master equation for memory dependent system - bath interactions .",
    "we will also solve the master equation for two qubit x states and obtain analytical expressions for the @xmath0 norm of coherence , concurrence and the fisher information .",
    "further , we will investigate the dynamics of the above mentioned measures for such type of interactions .",

    "this indicates that entanglement is a much more restricted quantum characteristic than coherence .",

    "we have examined the emergence of non - markovianity and its impact on the evolution of a number of facets of _ quantumness _ in the system .",
