    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a very successful theory in the regime of high energies where the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons .",
    "this is the so - called asymptotic freedom phase . in the low - energy regime , however , qcd is extremely hard to treat since in that regime it is nonperturbative . as it was shown by thooft @xcite qcd can be treated perturbatively in the approximation of large color number @xmath0 . within that approximation qcd",
    "is equivalent to a local field theory of mesons and `` glueballs '' .",
    "latter , witten @xcite showed that baryons can be represented by topological solutions  solitons , in an effective theory of mesons .",
    "such an effective theory had actually been proposed much earlier by skyrme @xcite . in his theory baryons",
    "emerge as topological solitons , the so - called skyrmions .",
    "their conserved topological charge , the winding number , is identified as the baryon number .",
    "skyrme theory has proved successful in the description of the static properties of baryons but it has also many deficiencies . among them are the large masses and the missing intermediate - range nucleon - nucleon attraction which is vital for the formation of nuclei .",
    "different generalizations of the theory have been suggested to remedy these deficiencies .",
    "one of the approaches is to add higher order derivative terms with the proper sign in the lagrangian .",
    "another approach is the inclusion of additional fields in the theory .",
    "the scale invariance and the trace anomaly of the underlying qcd theory in the low - energy limit leave place for the inclusion of scalar particles .",
    "for that reason many of the suggested generalizations of skyrme theory include a dilaton .",
    "the dilaton has considerable contribution to the intermediate - range attractive forces @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of a generalized skyrme model ( gsm ) including a dilaton has been derived from qcd in the low - energy regime in @xcite .",
    "skyrme theory coupled to gravity to our knowledge has been considered for the first time by luckock and moss @xcite .",
    "they studied black - hole solutions .",
    "self - gravitating skyrmions have been studied by glendenning , kodama , and klinkhamer @xcite in the approximation of large baryon numbers .",
    "they found that gravitating skyrmions can not be applied as models of baryon stars since they are energetically unstable and disintegrate into separate nonbounded solitons .",
    "self - gravitating solitons with baryon number one have been investigated numerically by droz , heuseler , and straumann @xcite .",
    "they have studied not only regular solutions but also black holes .",
    "their motivation was to find stable black - hole solutions which serve as counterexamples of the no - hair conjecture .",
    "the black holes that they obtained have nontrivial skyrme hair .",
    "the energy density of the matter field ( the skyrme field ) decays rapidly with the increase of the distance between the observer and the source and a distant observer can not distinguish them from the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "in other words the skyrme field does not contribute to new independent , asymptotic charges .",
    "the authors found that these solutions are stable against spherically symmetric perturbations @xcite .",
    "soon after that , bizon and chmaj @xcite found another branch of solutions in the same model which turned out to be unstable .",
    "the stability of einstein - skyrme ( es ) solitons and black holes has been studied also in @xcite .",
    "the einstein - skyrme black holes have been generalized to the case of asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetime in @xcite .",

    "axisymmetric soliton and black - hole solutions are given in @xcite .",
    "the so - called harmonic map ansatz , which is a generalization of the rational map ansatz , has been applied in @xcite to obtain axially symmetric @xmath1 gravitating skyrmions and in @xcite to obtain self - gravitating @xmath2 skyrmions with discrete symmetries  platonic skyrmions .",
    "the same authors obtained also solutions for spinning skyrmions @xcite . employing the rational map ansatz piette and probert constructed self - gravitating configurations which , unlike the solutions obtained with the hedgehog ansatz @xcite , remain bounded even for very large baryon numbers @xcite .",
    "self - gravitating objects in the generalizations of the skyrme model which include a dilaton have not been so intensely studied .",
    "klbermann obtained an effective equation of state ( eos ) for nuclear matter starting from a generalized skyrme lagrangian in which a dilaton and a @xmath3 meson are included @xcite .",
    "meson has been considered also in @xcite for the stabilization of the skyrmion without higher derivative terms . ] in this approach nuclear matter is described as skyrmion fluid which consists of free skyrmions with baryon number one immersed in a mean field background . with this eos massive skyrmion stars",
    "were constructed in @xcite@xcite and they were compared to neutron stars based on modern equations of state .",
    "astrophysical applications of the solutions and present plausible skyrmion star candidates are also given there .",
    "it appears that skyrmion stars are quite promising since they can explain the high masses of some stars that have been observed and can not be explained by some of the modern eos .",
