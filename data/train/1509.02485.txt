    "although the classical vertex coloring problem is np - hard @xcite , there are several graph classes for which this problem can be solved in polynomial time , most notably perfect graphs @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is said to be _ perfect _ if @xmath23 for every induced subgraph @xmath24 of @xmath0 , where @xmath25 represents the size of a maximum clique of @xmath24",
    ". however , the variants of the coloring problem mentioned above may not be polynomially solvable for perfect graphs and for other graph classes where the classical vertex coloring problem is indeed .",

    "on the other side there are many other classes for which this problem is np - hard ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the max - coloring problem is also np - hard in general and it seems to be substantially harder than the classical vertex coloring problem ; for instance it is np - hard in chordal graphs @xcite and in interval graphs @xcite , although in both graph classes , the classical version has linear resolution @xcite .",

    "this formulation may be extended with variables @xmath31 for each color @xmath32 specifying whether this color is used or not ; the minimum coloring is found by minimizing the sum of the latter variables .",

    "additionally , the model uses the variable @xmath36 for each @xmath27 , asserting whether @xmath30 is the representative of its own color class or not .",
    "we describe this model in detail in the following section .",
    "although ilp is np - hard , in many cases a complete description of the convex hull of its solutions is known and this description can be used to solve the _ separation problem _ associated to this polytope in polynomial time @xcite . based on the ellipsoid method , grtschel , lovsz and schrijver @xcite proved that the separation problem and the optimization problem over a polytope are polynomially equivalent , i.e. , if one problem is polynomially solvable , so is the other one ( we properly define these two problems in the following section ) . from this equivalence",

    "the mentioned equivalence between optimization and separation suggests that , for these problems , there must exist formulations with polynomially solvable separation problems and , moreover , that these formulations may admit elegant characterizations .",
    "the search for such characterizations is the main objective and motivation of our work .",
    "+ from a theoretical point of view , our main objective is to complete the polyhedral counterpart of these combinatorially solved graph coloring problems . on the other side , the study of these polytopes may lead us to a better understanding of their structures allowing us to ( polyhedrally ) find new classes of graphs colorable in polynomial time .",
    "+ in this sense , some work has been done on the standard formulation in a previous work @xcite and nice characterizations were found for simple graph classes such as trees and block graphs .",
    "also , the separation problem associated to this formulation for the classical vertex coloring problem can not be solved in polynomial time for graph classes for which list - coloring is np - hard , unless p = np , meaning that this formulation falls short too soon .",
    "therefore , one direct next step on this line of work is to study these families via other formulations .",
    "+ in this work we present results on the asymmetric representatives formulation @xcite for vertex coloring problems . in section [ sec : formulacion ] we introduce this formulation in detail and we derive from it a more compact formulation by eliminating redundant variables and equalities .",

    "<S> the equivalence between _ optimization _ and _ polyhedral separation _ suggests that , for these problems , there must exist formulations admitting some elegant characterization for the polytopes associated to them . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is interesting to study known formulations for vertex coloring with the goal of finding such characterizations . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we study the asymmetric representatives formulation and we show that the corresponding coloring polytope , for a given graph @xmath0 , can be interpreted as the stable set polytope of another graph @xmath1 , obtained from @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this result allows us to derive complete characterizations for the corresponding coloring polytope for some families of graphs , based on known complete characterizations for the stable set polytope .    </S>",
