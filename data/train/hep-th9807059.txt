    "furthermore , the combination of perturbative yang - mills- and dual effective potential leads to a self consistent effective potential ( i.e. compatible with the symmetries of the theory ) for all values of the external field .    the leading order contribution in the background magnetic field to the effective potential being evaluated exactely , the difference between the effective potential in the fundamental- and dual description is due to non - leading contributions . we find that up to an overall sign these contributions are almost identical in the two description . at present",
