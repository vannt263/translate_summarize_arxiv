    "in nearly all of the contexts in biology in which groups of cilia or flagella are found they exhibit some form of synchronized behavior . at the level of unicellular organisms",
    "this often takes the form of precise phase synchrony as in the breaststroke beating of biflagellated green algae @xcite , but it has also been known since the work of rothschild @xcite that swimming sperm cells can synchronize the beating of their tails when they are in close proximity . in multicellular organisms such as _ paramecium _ @xcite and _ volvox _ @xcite , and in the respiratory and reproductive systems of higher animals one often observes metachronal waves , which are long - wavelength modulations in the beating of ciliary carpets .",
    "there are three primary dynamical behaviors of ciliary groups , two involving beating waveforms that have a ` power stroke ' in which the filament pivots as a nearly straight rod , followed by a ` recovery stroke ' in which it is strongly curved , and a third in which the flagella beating is undulatory . in the first two cases it is useful to categorize the different geometries on the basis of the orientation of the power strokes of adjacent flagella .",
    "if we follow reference points along each flagellum - say , each center of mass - then they will move with either parallel ( cilia ) or anti - parallel ( biflagellate ) angular velocities ( figs .",
    "[ fig1]a & b ) . in the undulatory case ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) , found in mutants of _ chlamydomonas _ and during the ` photoshock response ' @xcite , nearby flagella beat parallel to each other .    based on the observations of rothschild @xcite on synchronized swimming of nearby sperm cells , taylor @xcite investigated the possibility that hydrodynamic interactions could lead to synchrony .",
    "his ` waving sheet model ' considered two infinite parallel sheets each in the shape of a prescribed unidirectional sinusoidal traveling wave . examining the rate of viscous dissipation as a function of the phase shift between the two waves",
    ", he found that the synchronized state had the least dissipation .",
    "while highly plausible as an explanation of synchronization , this model does not include a dynamical mechanism by which the synchronized state is achieved from arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "subsequent work @xcite has shown that adding waveform flexibility to the model yields a true dynamical evolution toward synchrony , and this has been confirmed by experiment @xcite .",
    "the recognition that hydrodynamic interactions alone are insufficient to generate dynamical evolution toward synchrony , and that some form of generalized flexibility is necessary had already been seen in the study of rotating helices as a model for bacterial flagella @xcite .",
    "this notion of ` orbital compliance ' was subsequently incorporated into several variants of bead - spring models @xcite of ciliary dynamics in which each beating filament is replaced by a moving microsphere which is driven around an orbit by internal forces and allowed to deviate by a radial spring . under the assumption that radial motions evolve rapidly relative to azimuthal ones , these models generically yield a nonlinear ode for the phase difference between the oscillators that takes the form of the adler equation @xcite .",
    "while these models lead to a microscopic interpretation of the generic adler equation , they are most appropriate for the situation in which the distance @xmath0 between the flagella is large compared to their length @xmath1 , where a far - field description in terms of stokeslets is valid @xcite .",
    "but many of the most interesting situations , such as the parallel and undulating geometries in figs .",
    "[ fig1]b&c , are in precisely the opposite limit , @xmath3 , while still in the regime @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the filament radius . in this limit",
    "it is clear that a proper description of the entire filament is necessary , because there are very strong near - field interactions all along them , and therefore a representation by a single point force would not be realistic . while computations incorporating microscopic models of flagella embedded in a viscous fluid show that synchronization does indeed occur through hydrodynamic interactions in this regime @xcite , it was only in subsequent work that the formally exact nonlocal description of hydrodynamic interactions in multi - filament systems was presented @xcite . taking advantage of the separation of scales @xmath6 , we present in section ii an asymptotic derivation of the leading - order hydrodynamic coupling between two filaments . in particular , we find that the relevant small coupling parameter is @xmath7 .",
    "the analysis leading to this result is reminiscent of the ` localized induction approximation ' in vortex filament dynamics @xcite .    at present",
    ", there is no single generally - accepted microscopic model for eukaryotic",
    "flagellar beating , although recent studies have begun to address the relative merits of several promising candidate models @xcite , which typically consist of a pair of coupled equations , one for the filament displacement , incorporating filament bending elasticity and viscous drag , and the other for the active bending forces associated with molecular motors . to illustrate how the hydrodynamic coupling and waveform compliance lead to synchronization , in section iii we introduce and analyze a heuristic single pde , of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a nonlinear operator , which displays self - sustained finite - amplitude wavelike solutions .",
    "section iv considers , both analytically and numerically , the dynamics of two filaments of the type introduced in section iii interacting through the coupling derived in section ii .",
    "the concluding section v discusses possible applications of the model .",
    "we consider two slender filaments of length @xmath1 undergoing some waving motion , as shown in fig .",
    "their mean separation is @xmath0 and we assume that their waving amplitude is at most of order @xmath0 .",
    "we seek to derive , in the linear regime of small amplitude displacements , the forces resulting from hydrodynamic interactions in the asymptotic limit @xmath10 .    ,",
    "are separated by a mean distance @xmath0 .",
    "the displacements from the mean of two arbitrary points on the curves , separated by the vector @xmath11 , are @xmath12 and @xmath13.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    let @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the vertical displacements of the filaments from their mean positions .",
    "we present the derivation of the force on one filament only , say filament 1 , as the dynamics of the other can be deduced by symmetry . in the linear regime",
    ", it is only necessary to consider the balance of forces in the vertical direction .",

    "we now proceed to calculate the flow @xmath21 induced by filament 2 . in the linear regime",
    ", this flow arises from a superposition of hydrodynamic point forces acting in the @xmath22 direction along filament 2 .",
    "neglecting end effects , the flow @xmath23 can thus be written as the following integral of stokeslets : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath26 the identity , and @xmath27 the vector that points from @xmath28 on filament 2 towards @xmath17 on filament 1 ( fig .",

    "to evaluate @xmath40 , we choose an intermediate length scale @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 .",

    "thus , the final expression for @xmath63 reads @xmath64\\frac{\\p h_2}{\\p t } \\bigg|_{x_2=x_1},\\ ] ] thus , the vertical component of the hydrodynamic force on filament @xmath18 is @xmath65 where we have used @xmath66 , with @xmath5 the radius of the flagella , and @xmath67 as in nearly all applications of slender body hydrodynamics , the parameter @xmath68 is asymptotically small only in the unphysical case when the aspect ratio is exponentially large .",
    "however , it is well - known that use of the leading order approximation of slender body hydrodynamics for larger values of @xmath68 is robust @xcite .",
    "finally , it is important to note that even in the case when the filaments are in phase and @xmath69 everywhere , and where @xmath70 it is not appropriate to evaluate eq .   at close contact between the two flagellar filaments ( @xmath71 ) . because the induced flow was computed as a superposition of stokeslets only .",
    "this is a good approximation only when all other singularities present have decayed away , in particular the ( potential ) @xmath72 source dipole which arises from the finite - size of the flagella .",
    "thus , the approximation requires that @xmath73 from every point of flagella 1 to every point in flagella 2 ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "in other words , the result is valid only within the limits @xmath74 .",
    "for example , for eukaryotic flagella with @xmath75 @xmath25 m and @xmath76 @xmath25 m , then the analysis is valid when the flagella are separated by a few microns , in which case @xmath68 decreases from @xmath77 for @xmath78  @xmath25 m to @xmath79 for @xmath80  @xmath25 m .",
    "the results above imply that if each of two nearby filaments is governed by an equation of the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are the parameters that differentiate the flagella , then the coupled pair evolves according to    [ coupled0 ] h_1 t & = & n_c_1(h_1 ) + , + h_2 t & = & n_c_2(h_2 ) + .     as we have only computed the hydrodynamic interaction to order @xmath68 , it is appropriate to consider the leading - order form of as @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "here , to represent the situation in which a flagellum is attached to an organism s surface , we focus on the case of a finite beating filament , say @xmath18 , pinned at its left end to a fixed support , with a free right end . as with all models for systems of this type , and the analysis in the previous section , we focus on low reynolds number dynamics .",
    "the structure of the most general equation of motion for a filament arising from balancing its tangential and normal forces and bending moments is well known @xcite . under the further assumption of linear filament elasticity and resistive force theory , and assuming that the filament deviates only slightly from straight , the linearized equation of motion for the tangent angle @xmath86 as a function of the arc length @xmath87 and time @xmath88 takes the form @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the young s modulus and @xmath63 the moment of inertia , per unit density , of the filament cross section about the axis of rotation , and @xmath91 is the active bending moment . recognizing that within this approximation @xmath92 we obtain @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the bending modulus of the filament .",
    "the distinction between different models of active bending is to be found in the particular form of @xmath91 , which may be coupled back to the geometry ( e.g. @xmath95 and its derivatives ) through an auxiliary equation of motion .",
    "recent work @xcite has studied the linearized dynamics of the unstable modes that arise in three models of the form , known as sliding - control @xcite , curvature - control @xcite , and the geometric clutch @xcite .",
    "the sliding control model , whose equation of motion does not explicitly break left - right symmetry , was shown not to exhibit base - to - tip propagating modes of the kind seen in experiment .",
    "in contrast , both the curvature - control and geometric clutch models , which do display modes with the qualitatively correct behavior , have a symmetry - breaking term @xmath96 . furthermore , as the dynamics is translational invariant in @xmath22 , there can be no terms explicitly dependent on @xmath14 itself .",
    "motivated by these results , and with an eye toward the simplest pde that will encode a characteristic wavelength , amplitude , and frequency of flagellar beating , we propose a form in which the left - right symmetry is broken with the derivative of the lowest order possible , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a nonlinear amplitude - stabilizing function of @xmath99 , the filament curvature .",
    "the presence of this advective term does not reflect any explicit fluid flow , rather it encodes processes internal to the filament that break symmetry .",
    "if we assume that the filament has @xmath100 symmetry , then @xmath98 will be an odd function of its argument . expressing @xmath98 as a taylor expansion up to cubic order we arrive at the model of interest , henceforth called the advective flagella ( af ) model @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are heuristic parameters of the model .",
    "we can now introduce dimensionless variables @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are constants .",
    "direct substitution of these new variables into ( [ onefilament00 ] ) , with the choice @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 yields the characteristic length @xmath113^{1/4}$ ] , and the dimensionless pde @xmath114 where @xmath115 , with @xmath116 . the length @xmath117 is the well - known elastohydrodynamic penetration length that arises in the study of actuated elastic filaments @xcite , and thus @xmath118 is the so - called sperm number . of the many possible boundary conditions we adopt the simplest : hinged at the left end ( @xmath119 ) and free at the right end ( @xmath120 ) . in this rescaled form ,",
    "the dynamics of a single filament is completely specified by @xmath121 and @xmath118 .",
    "note that the dynamics ( [ onefilament0 ] ) does not enforce filament length conservation beyond linear order , but this should not introduce any qualitative changes in the results below .",
    "the linear operator in is that of the advective version @xcite of the swift - hohenberg model @xcite without the term linear in @xmath122 , and is identical to that in the phenomenological model of dendrite dynamics introduced by langer and mller - krumbhaar @xcite and studied by fabbiane , _ et al . _ in the context of control theory @xcite .",
    "heuristically , we recognize that the second and fourth derivatives naturally select a most unstable length scale for a linear instability of the state @xmath123 , the advective term leads to rightward wave propagation , and the nonlinearity leads to amplitude saturation .",
    "the intuitive understanding that these are the minimum necessary , but also sufficient , ingredients for a model of the beating of a single flagellum , is proven to be correct by the numerical and analytic work presented in the following subsections . moreover , in section iv , we will also show that the dual features of linear terms @xmath124 which lead to a band of unstable modes , and amplitude saturation through nonlinearity will allow for waveform compliance when two filaments are hydrodynamically coupled .",
    "in this section we present the dynamical behavior of the af model obtained through numerical computations .",
    "the model was solved numerically using an implicit finite - difference scheme described in detail by tornberg and shelley @xcite , including one - sided stencils for derivatives at the filament endpoints .",
    "we shall see that for any choice of @xmath121 and @xmath118 the model selects a wavelength @xmath125 ( wavenumber @xmath126 ) , frequency @xmath127 and maximum amplitude @xmath128 .",
    "of particular interest are the limiting regimes @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the former is the regime seen in many experiments ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , while the latter corresponds to a semi - infinite system whose behavior far from the pinning wall approximates a traveling wave .     and three values of @xmath121 .",

    "figure [ fig3]a shows overlays of @xmath134 at various times during a full cycle for @xmath135 and three values of @xmath121 .",
    "we observe that for this length , and @xmath131 ( top waveform ) the oscillation amplitude has not reached saturation at the free end .",
    "thus , even larger values of @xmath121 ( middle and bottom ) naturally advect the waveform even faster to the right , resulting in a smaller maximum amplitude at the free end . as seen by comparing the two examples in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b with the top in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , where all three filaments have @xmath131 but different length , for @xmath132 the amplitude envelope is clearly linear in @xmath136 , for @xmath137 there is the beginning of a rollover , and for @xmath138 there is clear saturation . for @xmath139 the maximum amplitude of the waveform",
    "is reached at the free end of the filament , as seen in the natural biological waveforms and also in the models described above @xcite . in general , for a given value of @xmath121 , as @xmath118 grows relative to @xmath125 , the filament displays two distinct regions : a transition region adjacent to the wall where the amplitude grows along @xmath136 up to a characteristic @xmath140 , and a region beyond where the amplitude saturates and the oscillations approximate a traveling wave .",
    "the ` healing length ' @xmath140 increases with @xmath121 .    in the regime @xmath141 , and far from the wall , the amplitude @xmath128 , wave vector @xmath142 , and frequency @xmath127 of the approximate traveling wave are determined by @xmath121 only .",

    "the effective times @xmath218 correspond to faster motion than an isolated filament in the sinuous case and slower motion in the varicose arrangement .",

    "thus , depending on the characteristics of the solution @xmath224 , and only in the sinuous case , it is possible to find regions with a positive effective diffusion coefficient .",

    "second , we have applied this result to a model of flagellar beating that has the minimum necessary features to capture the essence of the system : self - sustained oscillations , broken left - right symmetry , bending elasticity , and waveform amplitude saturation .",
    "analytical and numerical studies of the model for the case of single filaments illustrate the mechanisms of wavelength , frequency , and amplitude selection , while those for coupled pairs display the basic elastohydrodynamic mechanism of synchrony .",
    "we emphasize that because of the extremely general form of the inter - filament coupling term , it can immediately be used to extend any particular model of the beating of a single filament to the coupled dynamics of two or more .",
    "a worthwhile extension would be the generalization of this result to include the presence of a no - slip wall at which filaments are anchored , with the goal of understanding metachronal waves .",
