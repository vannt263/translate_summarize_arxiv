    "atomic nuclei are made of two distinct particles , the protons and the neutrons .",
    "these nucleons constitute more than 99.95% of the mass of an atom . in order to form a stable atomic nucleus",
    ", a subtle equilibrium between the number of protons and neutrons has to be respected .",
    "this condition is fulfilled for 259 different combinations of protons and neutrons .",
    "these nuclei can be found on earth .",
    "in addition , 26 nuclei form a quasi stable configuration , i.e. they decay with a half - life comparable or longer than the age of the earth and are therefore still present on earth .",
    "these stable or quasi - stable nuclei are characterised by an approximately equal number of neutrons and protons for light nuclei , whereas going to heavier nuclei the neutron excess increases to reach n - z=44 for the heaviest stable nucleus @xmath1pb .",
    "in addition to these 285 stable or quasi - stable nuclei , some 4000 - 6000 unstable nuclei are predicted to exist , the exact number depending on the theoretical model used .",
    "close to 2500 nuclei have been observed already .",
    "these unstable radioactive nuclei can be classified into seven categories depending on their decay modes : i ) @xmath2 emitters ( about 375 ) which decay by ejecting a @xmath3he nucleus , ii ) @xmath4 emitters ( 1040 ) which transform a proton into a neutron plus a positron and a neutrino , or by capturing an electron from their atomic shells and emitting a neutrino , iii ) @xmath5 emitters ( 1020 ) which transform a neutron into a proton by emitting an electron and an anti - neutrino , iv ) fissioning nuclei ( 30 ) which split up into two roughly equal pieces , v ) one - proton ( 1p ) emitters ( about 25 ) , vi ) two - proton ( 2p ) emitters ( 2 ) and , finally , ( vii ) exotic - cluster emitters ( about 25 different nuclei emitting fragments of c , o , f , ne , mg , and si ) .",
    "these exotic radioactivities with masses from 14 to 32 may be considered as intermediate between @xmath2 decay and fission .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that this decay mode is never dominant .",
    "although some radioactive nuclei can decay by two or three of these different decay modes , the main decay mode is dictated by the proton - to - neutron ratio .",
    "for example , nuclei with a modest proton excess decay by @xmath4 disintegration .",
    "if the proton excess increases , the nuclear forces can no longer bind all protons and one reaches the proton drip line where the spontaneous emission of protons takes place from the ground state .",
    "heavier neutron - deficient isotopes will preferentially decay by @xmath2 emission , and for the heaviest nuclei fission is the dominant decay mode .",
    "for some of the heaviest nuclei , exotic - cluster emission is a small decay branch .",
    "the study of these different decay types started with the discovery of radioactivity by h. becquerel in 1896 . following the work of pierre and marie curie , e.  rutherford in 1899 classified the observed radioactivity into two different decay modes ( @xmath2 and @xmath0 rays ) according to the detected particle in the decay .",
    "villard discovered @xmath6 radiation in 1900 as a third radioactive decay mode .",
    "finally , the nuclear fission process was observed for the first time by o.  hahn and f.  strassmann and correctly explained by l.  meitner in 1938 .",
    "these `` classical '' decay modes have helped largely to understand the structure of the atomic nucleus and the forces acting in the nucleus .",
    "they have also found many applications which range from solid - state physics to astrophysics and medicine . with the discovery of a large number of new radioactive isotopes the understanding of nuclear structure advanced as well .",
    "beginning of the 1960 s , goldanskii  @xcite , zeldovich  @xcite , and karnaukhov  @xcite proposed new types of proton radioactivity in very proton - rich nuclei . for nuclei with an odd number of protons , one - proton radioactivity was predicted .",
    "this decay mode was indeed observed at the beginning of the 1980 s in experiments at gsi , darmstadt  @xcite .",
    "today about 25 ground - state one - proton emitters are known  @xcite .",
    "proton emission was also observed in many cases from long - lived excited states , the first being @xmath7co  @xcite .",
    "the study of one - proton radioactivity allowed testing the nuclear mass surface , to determine the sequence of single - particle levels and the detailed structure of the wave function of the emitted proton ( `` @xmath8 content '' of the wave function ) , and to investigate nuclear deformation beyond the proton drip line .",
    "zeldovich  @xcite was probably the first to mention the possibility that nuclei may emit a pair of protons .",
    "however , it was goldanskii  @xcite and jnecke  @xcite who first tried to determine candidates for 2p radioactivity .",
    "many others followed and the latest predictions  @xcite determined that @xmath9ti , @xmath10cr , @xmath11fe , and @xmath12ni should be the best candidates to discover this new decay mode .",
    "goldanskii  @xcite also coined the name `` two - proton radioactivity '' and it was galitsky and cheltsov  @xcite who proposed a first theoretical attempt to describe the process of 2p emission .",
    "more than 40 years after its theoretical proposal , 2p radioactivity was discovered  @xcite in the decay of @xmath11fe . in later experiments ,",
    "@xmath13zn  @xcite and most likely @xmath14ni  @xcite were also shown to decay by two - proton radioactivity .",
    "the observation of two - proton emission from a long - lived nuclear ground state was preceded by the observation of two - proton emission from very short - lived nuclear ground state , e.g. in the cases of @xmath15be  @xcite and @xmath16o  @xcite , and by the emission of two protons from excited states populated by @xmath0 decay  @xcite or inelastic reactions  @xcite .",
    "a particular case is the emission of two protons from an isomer in @xmath17ag@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the 2p emission process leads from an initial unbound state to a final state of separated fragments interacting by the coulomb force .",
    "this transition to the final state can be realized in many ways , such as the sequential two - body decay via an intermediate resonance , the virtual sequential two - body decay via the correlated continuum of an intermediate nucleus , the direct decay into the three - particle continuum or its particular diproton ( @xmath19he ) limit of two sequential two - body emissions .",
    "different types of theoretical approaches exist which focus on the three - body decay width : the extended r - matrix theory  @xcite , the real - energy continuum shell model ( the so - called shell model embedded in the continuum ( smec )  @xcite ) describing sequential two - body emission , virtual sequential two - body emission and diproton emission via two sequential two - body emissions  @xcite , the gamow shell model ( gsm ) with no separation between two- and three - body decays from the multi - particle continuum  @xcite , the three - body models with outgoing flux describing direct decay into the continuum  @xcite , the three - body models combined with complex coordinate scaling  @xcite , or the faddeev equations combined with either outgoing flux or complex scaling  @xcite .",
    "in the 2p decay , the three - body decay width provides global information with weighted contributions of different decay paths leading from the initial to the final state .",
    "hence , the value of the width by itself does not reveal the dominant transition mechanism . in the theoretical analysis",
    "however , one can switch off certain decay paths and look for the three - body partial decay width resulting from a particular decay path .",
    "this strategy is used in the smec analysis of the experimental results .",
    "obviously , the conclusions of such partial studies of decay mechanisms are not unambiguous .    in the present review",
    ", we will summarize the state of the art of experimental and theoretical studies on two - proton radioactivity .",
    "previous reviews , written before the actual discovery of ground - state two - proton radioactivity , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "protons are charged particles , therefore they are sensitive to the charge of other protons which create a coulomb barrier .",
    "this barrier prevents protons from quickly leaving the atomic nucleus even if they are unbound .",
    "the tunnelling probability depends on the available energy and the height of the coulomb barrier , which in turn depends on the nuclear charge z ( number of protons ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : barrier ] ) . the barrier penetration can give rise to measurable half - lives , if a certain balance between the available decay energy and the barrier height is respected . fig .  [",
    "fig : tunnel ] shows in a simple model the relation between barrier penetration half - life and decay energy for different nuclear charges  z. in general , the higher is the available energy , the shorter is the tunnelling time . in turn , for higher z more energy",
    "is needed for the same tunnelling time .",
    "the delay associated with the tunnelling process allows for the observation of 1p and 2p radioactivity .",
    "even if protons are unbound by e.g. 1  mev , the tunnelling of the combined coulomb and centrifugal barriers is not instantaneous , i.e. the nuclear decay is delayed by a measurable amount of time .",
    "however , due to experimental constraints , mainly linked to the techniques used to study 1p or 2p radioactivity and due to the competition with @xmath4 decay , observation limits exist . the lower half - life limit of about 1  @xmath20s comes from the fact that often the observation of the 1p or 2p emitter is accomplished with the same detection setup which is used to detect the decay of these nuclei .",
    "this means that a decay signal of typically 1  mev has to be observed a very short time after an identification signal ( i.e. an implantation signal in a silicon detector ) of several hundred mev .",
    "this observation limit has been reached in 1p - emitter studies ( see sect .",
    "3 ) . the upper limit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tunnel ] ) strongly depends on the structure of the decaying nucleus which governs the @xmath0-decay half - life .",
    "it can range from a few milliseconds to a few seconds . to observe charged - particle emission , the barrier - penetration half - life should be comparable or shorter than the @xmath0-decay half - life .    in the 1p decay , there are only two particles in the final state and the decay is a simple back - to - back decay , where the energy is shared between the two partners , the heavy recoil and the emitted proton , according to energy and momentum conservation .    in the case of 2p decay , the situation is more complicated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : barrier ] ) .",
    "the decay characteristics depend sensitively on the decay pattern itself .",
    "two schematical pictures are usually used to represent possible limiting cases : i ) the three - body decay and ii ) the diproton decay . in the former case",
    ", the two protons do not have any correlation beyond the phase - space constraints , which means that only energy and momentum conservation have to be respected .",
    "such a decay pattern yields an isotropic angular distribution of protons which share the total decay energy , with individual proton energies ranging from zero to the total decay energy .",
    "a more realistic discussion of the tunnelling process changes this picture because the barrier penetration strongly favours an emission of two protons with similar energies . in the latter case of diproton emission",
    ", one assumes that a pre - formed @xmath19he-cluster penetrates the coulomb barrier and decays outside the barrier .",
    "the decay half - life depends sensibly on the @xmath19he resonance energy .",
    "the diproton decay corresponds to two sequential binary decays for which the kinematics is rather easy .",
    "these two limits of 2p decay are not very realistic , but they are easy to grasp and give at least a schematic idea about the 2p emission . a theoretical description of 2p radioactivity ( see sect .",
    "8) is more sophisticated , although none of the models provide an unconstrained description of the nuclear structure and the decay dynamics involved in the 2p decay .    up to now",
    ", only total decay energies and half - lives have been measured in 2p radioactivity experiments .",
    "a deeper insight into the decay mechanism can be provided by the measurements of individual proton energies and the proton - proton angle in the center - of - mass . to access these observables , specific detectors have to be developed ( see sect .",
    "soon after the prediction of proton emission from atomic nuclei , the search for these new types of radioactivity started .",
    "the first exotic decay mode discovered was the @xmath0-delayed emission of one proton in the decay of @xmath21si  @xcite .",
    "a similar type of proton emission from an excited state was observed in the search for @xmath0-delayed proton emission from @xmath22ni . instead of populating @xmath22ni ,",
    "the authors  @xcite observed the population and decay of @xmath22co@xmath18 .",
    "this isomer ( t@xmath23  = 247  ms ) decays with a branching ratio of 1.5% by emission of a 1.59(3 )  mev proton .",
    "the first case of ground - state one - proton radioactivity was reported by hofmann et al .",
    "@xcite and by klepper et al .",
    "both experiments were conducted at gsi , the first one at the velocity filter ship using a fusion - evaporation reaction with a @xmath24ni beam and a @xmath25ru target to produce the proton emitter @xmath26lu , the second one at the on - line mass separator with the reaction @xmath24ni + @xmath27mo to synthesize @xmath28tm .",
    "one - proton radioactivity studies have developed soon into a powerful tool to investigate nuclear structure close to and beyond the proton drip line  @xcite with now more than thirty different nuclei known to emit protons from their ground states or low - lying isomeric states .",
    "these studies have given valuable information on the sequence of single - particle levels and their energies in the vicinity of the proton drip - line , on the @xmath8 content of the nuclear wave function , on the nuclear deformation , and they allow to test predictions of nuclear mass models in this region . most of this information can be obtained only by means of 1p radioactivity studies .",
    "more recently proton radioactivity was also used to identify nuclei and to tag events . in experiments",
    "e.g. at the fragment mass separator of the argonne national laboratory , the observation of a decay proton is used as a trigger to observe @xmath6 rays emitted in the formation of the proton emitter .",
    "therefore , not only the decay of these exotic nuclei can be studied , but also their nuclear structure in terms of high - spin states and their decay via yrast cascades  @xcite .",
    "the relatively large number of known ground - state proton emitters ( for almost all odd - z elements between z=50 and z=83 , at least one proton - radioactive nucleus is experimentally observed ) is due to the fact that the 1p drip line , i.e. the limit where odd - z nuclei can no longer bind all protons , is much closer to the valley of stability than the two - proton drip line . as an example",
    ", we mention that at z=50 the t@xmath29 isotope @xmath30sn is most likely the first 2p unbound nucleus . for z=51 , @xmath31sb with t@xmath32=1/2",
    "is probably proton unbound .",
    "this means that in this case the 2p emitter is three mass units more exotic than the 1p emitter , which leads to orders of magnitude lower production cross sections .",
    "the first experimental investigation of a possible ground - state 2p emitter was performed by karnaukhov and lu hsi - tink  @xcite .",
    "these authors tried to produce @xmath33ne by bombarding a nickel target with a 150  mev @xmath34ne beam from the jinr , dubna 300  cm cyclotron .",
    "the non - observation of any 2p event led the authors to conclude that either the production cross section is much smaller than assumed ( smaller than 10@xmath35  b ) or that the half - life of @xmath33ne is shorter than 10@xmath36s . as early as in 1963 , jnecke predicted its half - life to be of the order of 10@xmath37s  @xcite and recently its half - life was given as 9@xmath3810@xmath39s  @xcite .",
    "if we omit early measurements which used @xmath41-induced reactions in bubble or spark chambers  @xcite , and mass excess measurements performed by ajzenberg - selove et al .",
    "@xcite , the first successful study of a radioactive decay with an emission of two protons was performed in experiments with @xmath15be  @xcite . in these studies , @xmath15be was produced in a @xmath42li(@xmath43he , t)@xmath42be reaction .",
    "the triton as well as the @xmath2 particle and the protons from the decay of @xmath15be were observed .",
    "the ground state of @xmath42be is known to have a life - time of the order of 10@xmath39s .",
    "therefore , this nucleus can only be identified via its decay products .",
    "the authors observed an enhancement of low - energy @xmath2 particles compared to a simple phase - space distribution which could not be explained by means of final - state interactions .",
    "however , no conclusions on the decay mechanism could be drawn from these observations .",
    "a much more detailed study of the @xmath42be decay was performed over several years at the kurchatov institute , moscow ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these authors measured energy and angular distributions of the emitted particles and interpreted their data using jacobi coordinates . the most important conclusion of this analysis",
    "is that the spectra can be interpreted as a `` democratic '' three - body decay , i.e. the decay where none of the two - body subsystems of this three - body final state has a width which is small in comparison with the transition energy between the initial nucleus and the subsystem .",
    "the next step in the investigation of short - lived 2p ground - state emitters was the study of @xmath16o at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) of michigan state university , east lansing , usa  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "@xmath16o was produced by one - neutron stripping from a @xmath45o secondary beam .",
    "the complete reaction kinematics was reconstructed by measuring the momentum vectors of two protons in coincidence with the momentum of the heavy @xmath46c residue . from these measurements , the authors could produce an excitation energy spectrum of @xmath16o , determine the proton - proton energy difference and the proton - proton angle in the @xmath16o center of mass .",
    "these experimental data were interpreted by means of monte - carlo simulations , which employed the r - matrix theory  @xcite to describe the 2p decay in two extreme pictures : diproton emission with a @xmath47he resonance energy of 50  kev and three - body decay which is only restricted by the available phase space .",
    "[ fig : o12 ] summarizes these results .",
    "a comparison of the experimental results and the simulations clearly favours an uncorrelated three - body emission or a sequential decay , which may have roughly the same characteristics . at the time of this work , these conclusions were somewhat surprising , as it was believed that the intermediate 1p daughter state in @xmath48n was inaccessible due to energy conservation .",
    "in addition , a very large @xmath16o decay width was needed to explain the experimental data .",
    "however , later measurements  @xcite revealed that the @xmath48n ground state lies lower in mass and opens therefore the way for a sequential decay . with these new results , a consistent description of the decay of @xmath16o could be provided  @xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath51 mg was recently studied in an experiment at the fragment separator frs of gsi  @xcite . in this experiment , @xmath51 mg",
    "was produced by a one - neutron stripping reaction at the frs intermediate focal plane of @xmath34 mg , produced itself at the frs target in a fragmentation reaction of the @xmath52 mg primary beam .",
    "the protons emitted in the decay of @xmath51 mg were detected and tracked by a set of three dsssd , whereas the heavy decay product , @xmath53ne , was identified and its momentum measured in the second half of the frs .",
    "the measured data were compared to monte carlo simulations and allowed to extract the half - life of @xmath51 mg of @xmath54  = 4.0(15 )  ps and the associated two - proton q - value : @xmath55  = 0.75(5 )  mev .",
    "this value is much smaller than standard predictions like the one of the atomic mass evaluation  @xcite ( @xmath55  = 2.00(25 )  mev ) , the garvey - kelson relation  @xcite ( @xmath55  = 1.02(2 )  mev ) , or the prescription from antony et al .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath55  = 1.19(3 )  mev ) . however , the correlation between the q value and the decay half - life is well reproduced within the three - body model of grigorenko and co - workers  @xcite .    in the same experiment",
    "@xcite , the decay of @xmath33ne by two - proton emission was also observed and the known decay q value  @xcite of 1.41(2 )  mev was used to test the experimental procedure .",
    "for the systems @xmath15be , @xmath16o , and @xmath33ne , the decaying states have large widths so that the 2p emitter state and the 1p daughter state overlap .",
    "therefore , the sequential decay channel is opened and the decay will most likely take place sequentially .",
    "the situation in the case of @xmath51 mg is less clear , as the structure and the mass of the one - proton daughter @xmath56na is not known .",
    "however , with increasing nuclear charge , the coulomb barrier becomes stronger and the wave function is more and more confined in the nuclear interior which yields narrower states .",
    "therefore , it might well be that in nuclei like @xmath57si , @xmath58s , or @xmath59ar the coulomb barrier is already strong enough so that , with a possibly small decay energy , narrow levels avoid overlapping and the sequential decay path is , at least in a simple picture , not open .",
    "generally speaking , the 2p emission can take place as a sequential - in - time process or a simultaneous process . in its standard form",
    ", the sequential process happens when levels in the 1p daughter nucleus , both resonant and non - resonant ones , are accessible for 1p emission .",
    "this situation may be encountered when the emission takes place from highly excited levels of the 2p emitter .",
    "these levels can be fed either by @xmath0 decay or by a nuclear reactions .",
    "a clear signal for a sequential emission can be obtained when the intermediate level through which the emission passes is identified .",
    "this is the case , for example , when well defined one - proton groups sum up to a fixed 2p energy .",
    "the one - proton groups give then the energy difference between two well - defined nuclear levels .",
    "the possibility of @xmath0-delayed 2p ( @xmath02p ) emission was first discussed by jnecke  @xcite .",
    "he concluded that there should be no `` @xmath0-delayed diproton emitters '' with z@xmath6014 .",
    "this decay mode was also studied by goldanskii  @xcite who proposed possible candidates .    the first experimental observation of @xmath0-delayed 2p emission was reported by cable et al . in 1983  @xcite .",
    "their experiments , using a @xmath43he induced reaction on a magnesium target and a helium - jet technique , led to the first observation of @xmath61al by means of its @xmath0-delayed 1p emission from the isobaric analogue state ( ias ) in @xmath61 mg to the ground and first excited states of @xmath57na  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath02p decay mode was subsequently observed with two silicon detector telescopes which allowed to measure the energy of the two individual protons with good resolution  @xcite .    from the observation of",
    "well defined one - proton groups , cable et al . concluded that this decay is a sequential mode via intermediate states in the 1p daughter nucleus @xmath57na .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed in a further experimental study  @xcite where it turned out that the angular distribution of the two protons is compatible with an isotropic emission , although a small angular correlation ( less than 15% ) could not be excluded .    meanwhile more @xmath02p emitters have been identified . shortly after the discovery of @xmath02p decay from @xmath61al  @xcite , the same authors observed @xmath02p emission from @xmath58p  @xcite and from @xmath62ca  @xcite .",
    "all in all , nine @xmath02p emitters have been observed : @xmath61al  @xcite , @xmath63si  @xcite , @xmath58p  @xcite , @xmath64s  @xcite , @xmath65ar  @xcite , @xmath62ca  @xcite , @xmath9ti  @xcite , @xmath66cr  @xcite , and @xmath67ni  @xcite .",
    "most of these studies were characterized by rather low statistics inherent to most investigations of very exotic nuclei and hence no detailed search for angular correlations could be performed .",
    "in addition , most of the observed decays proceed via the ias in the @xmath0-decay daughter nucleus .",
    "the 2p emission from this state is forbidden by the isospin conservation law and can only take place via a small isospin impurity of the ias .",
    "the first high - statistics study of a @xmath02p emitter was carried out at isolde in cern  @xcite .",
    "for the first time , a rather high - efficiency , high - granularity setup which allows a high - resolution measurement in energy and angle was used .",
    "this experiment , which studied the decay of @xmath65ar , demonstrated the occurrence of @xmath02p decay branches via states other than the ias .",
    "indeed , many gamow - teller fed states could be shown to decay by 2p emission .",
    "the main interest of these decays is that they are isospin allowed and cover a wider range of spins for the 2p emitter states , the possible intermediate states and the final states .",
    "detailed studies of the proton - proton angular correlation for different 2p emission branches did not yield evidence for any angular correlation .",
    "in fact , the results were compatible with sequential emission via intermediate states in the 1p daughter nucleus .",
    "although there was some activity detected with the two protons sharing the available decay energy equally , the statistics of these events was too low and the angular coverage of the setup was not uniform enough to draw any conclusion on the possible observation of events , where the protons were correlated in energy and angle .",
    "therefore , despite a factor of 10 - 100 higher statistics as compared to earlier experiments , no angular and energy correlation , a possible signature of a strong proton - proton correlation , could be evidenced .",
    "this observation is not really astonishing . according to brown  @xcite , who studied the competition between 1p emission and correlated 2p ( diproton ) emission from the ias in @xmath61 mg",
    ", the weight of the direct 2p branch is expected to be at best of the order of a few percent and therefore rather difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "new attempts to search for such a correlated 2p emission in @xmath65ar are on the way  @xcite .",
    "these studies take profit from a much more uniform angular coverage .",
    "besides populating excited 2p emitter states by @xmath0 decay , these nuclear states can also be fed by nuclear reactions like pick - up , transfer , or fragmentation . in this section",
    ", we will describe experiments which used this kind of interaction to study 2p emission from excited states .      in an experiment performed at louvain - la - neuve , bain et al .",
    "@xcite bombarded a ( ch@xmath69)@xmath70 target with a @xmath45n radioactive beam populating highly - excited states in @xmath68o .",
    "the 7.77  mev state in @xmath68o , which is strongly populated in 2p transfer reactions  @xcite , is expected to have a significant admixture of a 2p configuration outside of the @xmath16c core .",
    "in addition , this state is 2p unbound by about 1.2  mev and , unlike states populated by a super - allowed @xmath0 decay , the 2p decay to the ground state of @xmath16c is isospin allowed .",
    "therefore , this resonance was believed to have a small 2p decay branch , either directly to the @xmath16c ground state or sequentially via a narrow state in @xmath45n ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bain ] ) .",
    "the two protons from the decay of the 7.77  mev resonance were detected with the leda device  @xcite .",

    "the decay products were detected in the must detector array  @xcite and in the speg spectrometer  @xcite .",

    "however , for higher lying states , a distinct angular correlation of the two protons could be observed for the first time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zerg2]b ) .",
    "this result is rather surprising , as many intermediate states in the 1p daughter nucleus @xmath33f should be accessible and therefore a sequential decay mechanism via these states should dominate .",
    "the interpretation of this decay pattern is still controversial .",
    "kanungo et al .",
    "@xcite and grigorenko et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that some of the excited states of @xmath53ne may have a pronounced 2p halo structure and a large overlap with the @xmath71o ground state leading to much larger spectroscopic factors for a direct 2p decay than for a sequential decay .",
    "obviously , the validity of this assertion depends on whether the configuration mixing in @xmath53ne leaves the @xmath71o core intact . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in smec studies  @xcite the correlated 2p emission is _ always _ hindered if 1p decay channels are open .",
    "moreover , the measured energies of the two emitted protons from @xmath53ne show large differences which can not be reconciled with a diproton scenario where roughly equal energies are expected for the two protons .",
    "another explanation of the 2p emission pattern in @xmath53ne could be the large deformation in higher lying states .",
    "strong anisotropy of the coulomb barrier could be a source of dynamical correlations between emitted protons even if this 2p decay is a sequence of two successive 1p emissions .",
    "effects of this kind have been discussed in the de - excitation of heavy - ion residues ( see e.g. ref .",
    "a similar explanation has been put forward also in connection with the anomalous decay properties of @xmath17ag@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "obviously , for a consistent interpretation of the @xmath71o + 2p experiment , higher statistics data is mandatory .      in an experiment performed at ornl oak ridge , gomez del campo et al .",
    "@xcite used a radioactive @xmath53f beam on a ( ch@xmath69)@xmath70 target to produce excited states in @xmath56ne .",
    "the experiment used a thick - target approach , i.e. only the protons could be detected behind the target , whereas the beam - like particles ( e.g. the heavy @xmath33o recoils from the decay of excited states in @xmath56ne ) could not penetrate the target .",
    "therefore , only protons with a relatively large energy loss depending on their emission point in the target could be observed . using two different incident energies of the @xmath53f beam , these authors observed at higher incident energy the emission of two protons which they interpreted as a decay of the 6.15  mev resonance state in @xmath56ne .",
    "for the lower energy , where this state could not be populated , no coincident protons were observed .",
    "both the relative proton - proton angle and the energy difference between the two protons was in agreement with simulations for a three - body decay of this state as well as for a diproton - type decay .",
    "this lack of sensitivity is to a large extent due to the limited statistics of the experiment , but also due to the limited angular coverage of the experimental setup .",
    "the decay of @xmath17ag@xmath18 is unusual in several respects .",
    "it possesses two @xmath0-decaying isomers and has the highest spin state ever observed which decays by @xmath0 decay .",
    "in particular , the second isomeric level seems to decay by several different decay branches : @xmath0-delayed @xmath6 decay  @xcite , @xmath0-delayed proton emission  @xcite , direct proton decay  @xcite , and direct 2p emission  @xcite .",
    "all these experiments were performed at the on - line separator of gsi  @xcite .",
    "the two protons were observed by means of silicon strip detectors which surrounded the implantation point of the on - line separator .",
    "this setup allowed for the measurement of the individual proton energies and the relative proton - proton angle .",
    "although the statistics of the 2p experiment is rather low  @xcite , the authors identified proton - proton correlations .",
    "they interpreted these data as due to simultaneous 2p emission from a strongly deformed ellipsoidal nucleus . in this case , the asymmetric coulomb barrier favours the emission of two protons within narrow cones around the poles of the ellipsoid , either from the same pole or on opposite sides .",
    "one should mention , that the observed proton - proton correlations in such a scenario are largely unrelated to the proton - proton correlations inside a nucleus .",
    "the microscopic theoretical study of the @xmath17ag@xmath18 decay is also impossible using the present - day computers , though only such studies could disentangle an internal structure of decaying states from dynamical effects of the anisotropic coulomb barrier , providing more details about the 2p decay pattern in the nucleus .",
    "unfortunately , further experimental studies of the @xmath17ag@xmath18 decay can not be made without new technical developments to produce @xmath17ag@xmath18 , as the on - line separator of gsi has been dismantled a few years ago .",
    "goldanskii  @xcite called it a pure case of 2p radioactivity , if 1p emission is not possible because the 2p emitter level is lower in energy than the level in the 1p daughter nucleus and , moreover , the corresponding levels are sufficiently narrow and thus do not overlap",
    ". the limitations of this picture will be discussed in chapter 8 .",
    "goldanskii also gave an arbitrary half - life limit of 10@xmath72  s  @xcite to distinguish between two - proton radioactivity and the decay of particle - unstable nuclei .",
    "none of the examples discussed above satisfy goldanski s radioactivity criterion ; they all have rather short half - lives ( of the order of 10@xmath39  s ) and for the light ground - state emitters , the states which emit the first and the second proton overlap significantly . in this sense ,",

    "firstly , their predicted decay energy is close to or in the range of energies ( 1.0 - 1.5  mev ) where 2p radioactivity is most likely expected to occur , and secondly these isotopes are already or could soon be produced in projectile - fragmentation type experiments .",

    "the last 2p emitter candidate tested in this experiment was @xmath9ti .",
    "in agreement with previous experiments , this nucleus turned out to decay predominantly by @xmath0 decay .",
    "several @xmath0-delayed proton groups could be identified and the 2p emission q value ( q@xmath76 = 670@xmath77100 kev ) could be determined , indicating a rather high barrier - penetration half - life and therefore a rather low probability for 2p radioactivity .",

    "this capability allowed for a rejection with a high probability of a possible @xmath0-delayed origin of the decay events with an energy release of about 1.1  mev .",
    "other pieces of evidence from the ganil experiment were the smaller width of the 1.14  mev peak as compared to @xmath0-delayed proton emission peaks in neighbouring nuclei and the observation of daughter decays consistent with the decay of @xmath66cr , the 2p daughter of @xmath11fe .",

    "its observation and the measurement of its properties , like e.g. the excitation energy of the first 2@xmath88 state , were expected to teach us a lot about the persistence of shell structure far from the valley of stability .",

    "the isotope @xmath14ni was first observed in 1999 at ganil caen  @xcite , where four events could be unambiguously identified .",
    "this result was confirmed in 2004 , when again four events of @xmath14ni could be registered in a new sissi / lise3 experiment at ganil  @xcite .",
    "these data were obtained in the same run as the second @xmath11fe data set from ganil , because the acceptance of the sissi / lise3 device allows the measurement of different neighbouring nuclei at the same time .",

    "these four decay events , one of possible 2p origin and three from @xmath0-delayed decays , were also used to determine the half - life of @xmath14ni ( t@xmath23= 2.1@xmath90ms ) . although this single possible 2p decay event is not considered sufficient to claim the observation of 2p radioactivity for @xmath14ni , these data were nonetheless used to determine the 2p branching ratio to be 25@xmath91% and the partial 2p half - life to be t@xmath80=8.4@xmath92ms  @xcite .      from all 2p emitters observed up to now , the ground - state emitter @xmath11fe is the best candidate to search for a clear signal of correlated emission and to study in detail the decay mechanism .",
    "as just mentioned , 2p emission could only be governed by phase space or there could be more or less strong angular and energy correlations . in order to study these questions , new experimental setups had to be imagined , the basic limitation of the silicon - detector setups being that the 2p emitters are deeply implanted in a silicon detector , which then does not allow the detection of individual protons , but rather of the total decay energy and the half - life only .",
    "the solution to this problem is the use of gas detectors capable to visualize the traces of the emitted protons .",

    "the bordeaux detector is based on gas electron multiplier technology  @xcite and a double - sided microgroove detector  @xcite with an application - specific integrated - circuit read - out , whereas the warsaw detector uses an optical read - out system by means of a digital camera and a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) which registers the time sequence .",

    "[ smec_1p ] ) and the unitarity of the @xmath103-matrix which causes a non - trivial energy dependence of the coupling matrix elements between resonance states and continuum .",
    "@xmath141 includes basic structural information contained in @xmath122 ( the closed quantum system hamiltonian ) and the coupling matrix elements between discrete and continuous states which depend on the structure of the decay channels .",
    "smec studies of 2p decays in @xmath11fe , @xmath14ni and @xmath13zn have shown that the virtual sequential 2p emission can not be separated easily from the diproton decay , even though they describe two different limits .",
    "the first one corresponds to two uncorrelated proton emissions separated in time , whereas the latter one represents an instantaneous emission of strongly correlated two protons .",
    "the most probable energies of these protons are nearly the same in both scenarios .",
    "if half - lives for these two pathways are strongly different , then neglecting their mutual interference and the omission of spatio - temporal correlations in the virtual sequential decay can be probably justified . otherwise , the 2p emission described by an effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff_t2 ] ) has to be considered as a genuine three - body decay .",
    "unfortunately , the 1p emission thresholds in @xmath11fe , @xmath14ni and @xmath13zn are unknown so that one can not rule out the possibility of a strong interference between ( virtual ) sequential and diproton decay modes .",
    "smec calculations in @xmath11fe with @xmath94 values which are consistent with available theoretical estimates  @xcite show that the virtual 2p sequential half - life is by a factor of about 10 longer than the diproton half - life .",
    "this would favour an interpretation of the observed 2p emission in this nucleus as predominantly the diproton decay .",
    "such a conclusion agrees also with the observation of a symmetric energy distribution of individual protons in the decay of @xmath11fe  @xcite .    for the sake of argument ,",
    "let us suppose that the virtual sequential emission mechanism yields much longer half - lives in all three nuclei : @xmath11fe , @xmath14ni and @xmath13zn .",
    "it is then interesting to notice that the diproton decay mechanism in smec reproduces quite well the experimental partial 2p decay half - life in a doubly magic nucleus ( @xmath14ni ) and fails by a factor of about 4 in both open - shell nuclei ( @xmath11fe and @xmath13zn ) .",
    "if this tendency is not coincidental , or follows from a poor knowledge of @xmath282-values and an insufficient experimental statistics , then one might be tempted to associate it with pairing correlations .",
    "as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the change of pairing correlations induced by the configuration mixing beyond the 1p0f shell may well be responsible for this enhancement . a similar effect has been seen a long time ago in ( p , t ) transfer reactions  @xcite .",
    "the absence of this component of pairing correlations is more important in open - shell nuclei than in a closed - shell nucleus @xmath14ni .",
    "hence , one may expect that the fp shell smec calculations are better suited to describe the observed 2p partial half - life in @xmath14ni than in @xmath11fe and @xmath13zn .",
    "one should mention that different effective interactions in the @xmath209 and @xmath315 shells give similar results to within @xmath316% .",
    "external mixing , generated by the @xmath127-@xmath128 coupling , modifies the diproton decay width by less than 10% in @xmath11fe and @xmath296% in @xmath14ni .",
    "again , the smec predictions for the closed - shell nucleus @xmath14ni seem to be more reliable since the direct @xmath94-dependence of the diproton half - life is weaker in this case .",
    "the r - matrix model  @xcite calculations show a gradual decrease of the 2p partial half - life going from @xmath11fe to @xmath13zn across the shell closure at z=28 , n=20 .",
    "consequently , the diproton half - life in @xmath11fe is by a factor of @xmath317 longer than in @xmath13zn . on the contrary , both in the smec results and in the data , the 2p partial half - lives of @xmath11fe and @xmath13zn are very close .    , @xmath318 , and @xmath319 , as calculated in the generalized r - matrix theory  @xcite ( full triangles ) and in the smec  @xcite(open circles ) .",
    "the experimental values are shown with black points . for reasons of clarity ,",
    "the uncertainty of theoretical results due to the uncertainty of the @xmath55 values and experimental error bars are not shown.,width=642,height=453 ]    fig . [ systematic ]",
    "compares the experimental partial half - lives for the diproton decay of @xmath320 , @xmath318 , and @xmath319 with the calculated ones in the smec and in the extended r - matrix model .",
    "one may notice two characteristic features from this comparison .",
    "firstly , smec and r - matrix models predict a different z - dependence of calculated 2p partial half - lives around the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath14ni .",
    "secondly , smec yields an opposite tendency of @xmath11fe and @xmath13zn half - lives with respect to the half - life of @xmath14ni than seen experimentally . concerning the first point",
    ", one may tentatively assume that this feature is related to the continuum coupling induced dynamical effects in the 2p decay which are missing in the r - matrix description .",
    "certainly , one does not expect that this different systematic tendency of calculated half - lives in the smec approach and in the r - matrix model could be explained by the absence of configuration mixings beyond the 1p0f shell , since both in smec and in r - matrix calculations these configurations are not included .",
    "concerning the second point , it may be related to the small number of channels in smec calculations of the @xmath127-@xmath128-coupling induced an external configuration mixing . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the external mixing is a result of coupling between the ground state of nucleus @xmath133 $ ] and the two channels corresponding to the ground state and the first excited state of a nucleus @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "this restriction on the number of channels is justified in closed - shell nuclei as in this case the ground - state to ground - state coupling of the @xmath133 $ ] and @xmath166 $ ] nuclei exhausts up to about 90% of the total coupling strength . for open - shell nuclei , the strength of continuum coupling",
    "is largely spread over many channels , both open and closed .",
    "indeed , the smec studies of continuum coupling effects in oxygen and fluorine isotopes  @xcite have shown that a contribution of the ground - state to ground - state coupling to the total continuum coupling strength may vary between a few @xmath321 and @xmath322 in open - shell nuclei .",
    "the size of a model space involved in the calculation of the 2p decay in @xmath320 , @xmath318 , and @xmath319 makes it impossible to verify this observation numerically , but if true it may lead to a strong enhancement of the contribution from the virtual sequential 2p decay path and , henceforth , to a decrease of the 2p partial half - life .",
    "one should remind , that the interference between the virtual sequential and diproton emission paths can not be probably neglected if both processes become equally important .    as said before , smec predictions are very sensitive to @xmath282 values",
    "which for the nuclei studied are either not known experimentally with a sufficient precision ( @xmath55 values ) , or are unknown ( @xmath94 values ) .",
    "the virtual sequential decay half - lives depend explicitly and strongly on the continuum coupling dynamics between the @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath128 , @xmath153 subspaces which is governed by @xmath282 values .",
    "a direct dependence of the diproton half - lives on @xmath127-@xmath128 virtual couplings is rather weak , i.e. dressing of the diproton decay mode by virtual 1p excitations does not change significantly its properties in @xmath11fe , @xmath14ni and @xmath13zn   state of @xmath56ne  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the diproton mode is dressed by virtual excitations to the _ opened _ 1p emission channels leading to the particle stable @xmath323 , @xmath324 final states in @xmath53f . in general , couplings to open 1p emission channels strongly modify properties of the diproton mode . ] . on the other hand , this idealized decay mode represents a sensible approximation of the 2p decay process described by ( [ h_eff_t ] ) only if the virtual sequential decay path is strongly suppressed .",
    "this in turn depends directly on the dynamics of the @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath128 , @xmath153 virtual couplings .",
    "hence , further progress in describing spontaneous 2p radioactivity and understanding the role of both pairing correlations and virtual excitations to continuum states in this process depends on a precise experimental determination of the @xmath94 and @xmath55 values .",
    "the study of 2p emission opens a new window to investigate nucleon - nucleon correlations and the structure of atomic nuclei .",
    "although these studies , at least partially , could have been performed already with @xmath0-delayed 2p emitters , the field received a strong boost with the observation of ground - state 2p radioactivity .",
    "this discovery triggered new experimental developments , such as time - projection chambers , and new theoretical activity related mainly to the unified description of structure and reactions with two - particle continua and the development of various methods to deal with three - body asymptotic states of charged particles / fragments .",
    "both experiment and theory have reached a certain level of sophistication , but significant improvements are still needed to develop 2p radioactivity into a powerful tool for nuclear structure studies . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the lack of three - body asymptotic channels hampers the calculation of various correlation functions in the smec framework .",
    "description of direct 2p emission with three - body asymptotics in smec requires inclusion of finite - range interactions . at the moment",
    ", the angular correlations between decay products can be studied solely in the three - body cluster models .",
    "the simplified description of nuclear structure in cluster models does not allow to draw deeper conclusions about 2p in - medium correlations from these angular correlations .    as one deals with three particles in the final state , the 2p emission can occur in different ways , i.e. the asymptotic channel can not be defined unambiguously .",
    "consequently and in contrast to one - proton or @xmath2 radioactivity , the 2p radioactivity does not have a unique experimental signature and its interpretation is always depending on the theoretical interpretation .",
    "a complete theoretical description of 2p emission has to take into account all different decay paths and include interferences between them .",
    "it is not obvious whether different 2p decay paths , such as the diproton path and the virtual sequential 2p decay path which both yield similar proton energy distributions , can be distinguished by , e.g. , the proton - proton and/or proton - fragment correlations .",
    "further studies along this line are necessary for a best possible characterization of 2p radioactivity .    on the experimental side ,",
    "more cases of 2p radioactivity have to be studied and the quality of the data has to be improved , as the possibilities to compare the experimental data existing today with modern theories of 2p radioactivity are hampered by large experimental error bars . to improve the experimental data , increased statistics is only one aspect . in the case of @xmath11fe ,",
    "the major contribution to the uncertainty of the decay energy comes from the energy calibration .",
    "therefore , new and improved calibration tools have to be developed as well .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath94 and @xmath55 would help to check different features of smec calculations , such as the choice of effective interactions and valence space , or the absence of explicit three - body asymptotics .",
    "all experiments performed up to now seem to indicate that the sequential decay prevails , as long as intermediate states for 1p emission are energetically accessible .",
    "the only exceptions seem to be the decays of excited states in @xmath53ne and in @xmath17ag@xmath18 , where despite many intermediate states a strong proton - proton correlation was observed .",
    "a halo - like structure and/or dynamical effects associated with the tunnelling through the anisotropic coulomb barrier could be at the origin of the observed correlation .",
    "higher statistics data and advanced theoretical studies are needed to confirm or reject this interpretation .",
    "another application of the 2p studies are direct resonant 2p",
    "radiative capture processes  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the astrophysical 2p capture rates can be enhanced by as much as several orders of magnitude in certain ranges of excitation energies .",
    "similar tendency was found for the size of a nonresonant e1 contribution to the 2p capture rates  @xcite .",
    "these predictions may have important consequences for the rp - process path changing earlier predictions concerning rp - process waiting points  @xcite .",
    "the advent of new radioactive beam machines like the ribf facility in riken , japan or the fair facility in gsi , germany should give access to new ground - state 2p emitters such as @xmath100ge , @xmath101se , or @xmath325kr and allow one to achieve much higher rates for the known ones .",
    "these possibilities will most likely significantly increase the body of experimental data and may establish 2p radioactivity as a powerful tool of nuclear structure studies .",
    "these new facilities may allow also to search for a similar phenomenon which is one- and two - neutron radioactivity .",
    "from an experimental point of view , it seems to be rather difficult to find good candidates for these new decay modes . due to the absense of the coulomb barrier for neutrons ,",
    "only the centrifugal barrier will prevent these neutrons from escaping `` immediately '' from the nucleus . to create a sufficiently high barrier ,",
    "high - j orbitals are needed which form the nuclear ground state only in medium - mass nuclei .",
    "however , these medium - mass neutron drip - line nuclei are rather far away from the valley of stability and extremely difficult to produce .",
    "possibly , high - j isomers could be candidates for this kind of radioactivity .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", two - neutron emitters would be ideal cases to study .",
    "all theoretical formalisms can be applied to the two - neutron case without major changes .",
    "actually , the two - neutron three - body problem can be solved exactly and not approximately as in the three - body case with charged particles . moreover",
    ", angular correlations will be directly related to the internal two - neutron correlations without the uninteresting correlations due to a possible anisotropy of the coulomb barrier .",
