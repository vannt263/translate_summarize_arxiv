    "optical observations from the ground , however , have not always been of comparable quality and late - time phases have been seldom monitored accurately @xcite .",

    "while the early - time afterglow is often well sampled by the network of small and medium - class robotic telescopes around the world , the late - time afterglow can only be monitored with the largest instruments and only at the cost of significant observing time @xcite . based on these considerations",
    ", we started a new program of afterglow observations with the explicit goal of providing full coverage of the optical / near - infrared ( nir ) afterglow light curve for a selected number of events ( building on visibility and availability of early - time observations ) rather than providing sparse datapoints for most of the observable _ swift _ grbs .",

    "the afterglow was not detected in the radio band at 8.46ghz almost two days after the grb @xcite .",

    "data reduction was carried out following standard recipes with the _ eclipse _ package @xcite .",
    "photometry was computed by aperture and profile - fitting photometry with the _ daophot _ @xcite and _ sextractor _",
    "@xcite packages .",
    "photometric calibration was derived from the observation of standard stars in the optical on two different nights and with the 2mass catalogue @xcite in the nir , although in a few cases the small field of view of nir detectors made the calibration more difficult .",
    "tarot data were calibrated with observations of two field stars and final magnitudes are expressed in the r2 system of the usno - b1 catalogue @xcite .",
    "the results from the photometric observations are reported in table[tab : photo ] .    for polarimetry ,",
    "the offset between instrumental and intrinsic polarization was fixed by the observation of a polarized standard star .",
    "instrumental polarization was derived by observation of non - polarized stars .",
    "the procedure we followed for the analysis of the fors1 polarization data was extensively discussed by @xcite . at the time of the observation the afterglow optical emission was consistent with null polarization with a 95% upper limit of 0.9% ( 1.3% at 3@xmath22 ) for the degree of polarized flux .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the temporal resolution of the observations does not allow us to check in detail the early - time density profile of the circumburst medium or possible chromaticity in the evolution .",
    "the modest duration of the prompt event and the late onset time argues against a scenario with frequent multiple peaks as for grb070311 @xcite .",
    "a smooth rising phase can also be produced by a decreasing extinction in the case of a radially decreasing circumburst density @xcite .",
    "the detection of the afterglow in the @xmath23 band ( table[tab : photo ] ) eliminates this last possibility due to the high absorption required .",
    "an alternative giving a chromatic maximum could be the passage of the typical synchrotron frequency in the optical / nir bands .",
    "the time spread for the maximum would depend on the width of the observed frequency band , @xmath24 , with the higher frequencies peaking first .",
    "the passage would also produce a spectral change from a positive ( @xmath25 ) to negative @xmath26 $ ] spectral index in the slow - cooling case @xcite .",
    "again , this is not supported by the data .",
    "the maximum during the early afterglow evolution can then be interpreted as the afterglow onset as for the case of grb060418 and grb060607a @xcite . following the formalism reported in eqs.1 and 2 of @xcite in the thin - shell case",
    "since the prompt duration was much shorter than the peak of the afterglow emssison , we can derive , for grb071010a , @xmath27 for a uniform interstellar medium ( ism ) and @xmath28 in the case of a wind - shaped density profile .",
    "these are lower than the values inferred for grb060418 and grb060607a due to the late occurrence of the maximum , but still within the theoretical expectations for the external - shock scenario @xcite .",
    "the observed maximum can not be related to reverse shock emission .",
    "the reverse shock should be in general a short - lasting phenomenon , and in the thin - shell case it should peak slightly before the deceleration time , roughly just before the afterglow onset , and dominate it in case the typical synchrotron emission is close enough to the optical band @xcite . the rapid decay ( @xmath29 , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicted for the reverse shock emission is inconsistent with the much milder decay observed after the optical flux peak ( table[tab : fitpar ] ) .",
    "the occurrence of rebrightenings or flares during the temporal evolution of grb afterglows is not uncommon .",
    "the long time coverage usually provided by the _ swift _ xrt affords the study of a large sample of flares from the spectral and energetic @xcite , or temporal and morphological @xcite points of view . in",
    "the optical / nir the occurrence of large flares seems to be less common , while in a remarkable fraction of cases a rebrightening due to discrete energy injection was included in the modelling @xcite .",
    "our dataset does not permit a detailed analysis of the temporal and spectral evolution of the rebrightening around 0.6d .",
    "the simplest approach is to model the transition as due to the discrete injection of a sizeable amount of energy in the fireball interacting with the external medium by means of refreshed shocks .",
    "the flux density produced by an external shock scales with the energy content of the fireball apart from minor differences between the optical / nir and x - ray bands @xcite which are not detectable in our data . therefore , to account for the observed @xmath30 , an amount of energy comparable to the energy content of the fireball needs to be supplied to the system .",
    "remarkably , a discrete episode of energy injection is not supposed to modify the spectrum of the synchrotron radiation emitted at the shock front if the cooling frequency does not enter or cross the observing bands @xcite , in agreement with the achromatic evolution of the afterglow of grb071010a .",
    "a discrete energy injection , comparable to the energy content of the fireball , was also suggested by @xcite for grb050408 .",
    "also in the case of the xrf050824 a rebrightening was observed at rather late time and a large delayed energy injection was invoked @xcite . in principle , a rebrightening could be induced by a density variation in the circumburst medium as proposed by @xcite for the grb021004 ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , this explanation can not be applied to our case , since the x - ray range is above the cooling frequency and therefore insensitive to density variations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a transition from wind to homogenous medium , due to the crossing of the wind reverse shock could also generate a rebrightening , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "other explanations are also possible , such as a double jet @xcite or a patchy shell @xcite . a structured jet with a bright narrow core and fainter wings can also produce a rebrightening close to the jet - break time @xcite , though in such a case it would only be due to perspective rather than to real energy injection , possibly driving to a sharp transition if seen from a suitable angle .",
    "finally , although not required by the data , the temporal profile of the rebrightening is also consistent with that of a fast rise and exponential decay pulse simply superposed on the underlying afterglow .",
    "the relatively long duration of the pulse , as compared to the time of occurrence , @xmath31 , is compatible with an origin of the emission at the external - shock radius ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "following the rebrightening at about 0.6d , the afterglow evolution shows a sharp break at about 1d consistent with being achromatic in the x - ray and optical / nir bands ( fig.[fig : lc_all ] ) .",
    "following @xcite only seven grb afterglows have been found so far with such an achromatic transition .",
    "moreover , the general temporal behaviour of the optical / nir and x - ray light curves seems to be the same , supporting at least qualitatively the possibility that we are observing emission from a single outflow with a transition due to a beamed geometry .",
    "the standard external - shock model predicts specific relations between temporal and spectral parameters .",
    "however , it is a well - established observational fact that grb afterglows show more complex behaviours than expected before the launch of _",
    "many mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the new features discovered with _ swift _",
    ": delayed energy injection , late central engine activity , refreshed shocks , high - latitude emission , etc .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these ingredients affect the light curve shape in a number of ways . however , since the fundamental emission process in the soft x - rays and in the optical / nir is still synchrotron , the spectra should follow the general predictions of the external - shock scenario .",
    "we therefore begin the analysis starting from the broad - band sed from the optical / nir to the x - rays .",
    "the evolution of the afterglow , including the early phases , is consistent with being fully achromatic .",
    "we derive the sed at about 0.8d in order to minimise the need to extrapolate the observations adopting a temporal behaviour ( fig.[fig : sed ] ) .    .",
    "]    the amount of rest - frame neutral absorption required by the x - ray data ( @xmath32@xmath3 ) is within the range observed for a set of well - studied _ swift _ grb x - ray afterglows @xcite . in the optical / nir",
    "the observed sed curvature clearly indicates the need for a substantial absorption , as derived in sect.[sec : dana ] , with @xmath33 mag .",
    "such an amount of intrinsic absorption in the optical / nir is uncommon among grbs with sufficient data quality to allow a meaningful study ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comprehensive analysis ) .",
    "as for most of the grb optical afterglows , a smc - like extinction curve seems to provide a better fit to the data @xcite , although the gas - to - dust ratio @xmath34 is higher than in the smc , again in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the spectral indices in the optical / nir and x - ray bands allows us to constrain the electron energy distribution index @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) . with the cooling frequency in between the optical / nir and the x - rays ( probably just below the x - ray range , as shown in fig.[fig : sed ] ) , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 and therefore @xmath39 and @xmath40 , independent of the circumburst matter - density profile in the slow - cooling regime ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these values for @xmath35 , in particular from the x - rays , lit in the high tail of the distribution derived by @xcite or @xcite , although still consistent with it .",
    "the value derived from the optical is also consistent with the typical results ( @xmath41 ) of numerical simulations of relativistic shocks @xcite .",
    "knowing the electron distribution index we can predict the decay rate in the optical / nir before the occurrence of a jet break , considering also the constraints from the x - rays : @xmath42 ( 0.75 - 1.5 from the optical / nir only ) in the case of a constant - density radial profile of the circumburst matter , or @xmath43 ( 1.25 - 2.0 from the optical / nir only ) in the case of an environment shaped by a wind from a massive star . for the x - rays ( frequencies above the cooling frequency ) we have @xmath44 ( 1.4 - 2.0 from the x - ray only ) independent of the density profile ( and unconstrained by our data ) .",
    "it is clear from the fit results , reported in sect.[sec : dana ] and shown in fig.[fig : lc_all ] , that interpreting the break at @xmath45d as a jet break , the optical / nir decay before the transition would be in essential agreement with the expectations for a constant - density medium only for the @xmath35 value derived from the optical . otherwise , a continuous additional injection of energy as required by the modeling of numerous _ swift _ x - ray afterglows @xcite should be considered .",
    "after the jet break , the decay index in the slow - cooling regime must be the same at all frequencies ( higher than the typical synchrotron frequency , as expected @xmath45d after the high - energy event ) , and independent of the circumburst matter - density profile . for @xmath46 , as in our case , it is simply @xmath47 . again",
    "the observed decay indices are consistent with the expectations only with the value derived from the optical / nir .    in principle",
    ", the post - break decay indices would also be consistent with a wind model before the occurrence of a jet break with @xmath48 .",
    "this @xmath35 value would be better supported by the x - ray spectral data , although the achromaticity of the transition at @xmath45d is not consistent with this scenario .",
    "the distribution of @xmath35 values , although likely inconsistent with a unique @xmath41 @xcite , supports @xmath49 for essentially all the afterglows once the analysis is based on the spectral parameters rather than on the temporal behaviour .    summing up , the hypothesis that the sharp achromatic transition at about @xmath50d be a real jet break appears consistent with the data if we assume that continuous energy injection is affecting the temporal decays .",
    "this would be one of the very few instances of a jet break observed both in the optical / nir and the x - rays .",
    "the consistency of the grb071010a parameters with the ghirlanda relation ( see below ) lends some indirect support to the jet - break interpretation .",
    "after about ten days the afterglow light curve flattens considerably , plausibly as a result of the emergence of the host - galaxy light .",
    "our data quality does not permit to draw any conclusion about the possible presence of a sn component affecting the light curve and mimic the host - galaxy contribution ( see fig.[fig : lc_all ] ) .",
    "a sn component comparable to sn1998bw @xcite at the redshift of grb071010a and including the effect of the fitted absorption in the optical would be in the @xmath51 band about 0.8mag fainter than our last measured point .",
    "it is well known that the position of a grb in the radiated energy vs. spectral peak photon energy plane can provide useful clues on the nature , physical origin , and geometry of its emission . indeed ,",
    "while all  normal \" long grbs and xrfs show a clear correlation between these two quantities , short grbs and peculiar sub - energetic grbs ( 980425 and , possibly , 031203 ) show a different behavior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , collimated grbs seen off - axis are expected to deviate from these spectrum - energy correlations .",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath53 values derived from the analysis of the time - averaged spectrum ( see sect.[sec : dana ] ) are fully consistent with the @xmath54 ( amati ) relation @xcite , showing that the prompt emission of grb071010a is not peculiar and indicating that , if the emission is collimated , the off - axis angle is small .",
    "in addition , with a break interpreted as a jet break at about 1d and by assuming , following @xcite , a constant circumburst matter - density profile ( @xmath55@xmath56 ) and a fireball kinetic to radiated energy conversion efficiency of 0.2 , we derive a jet opening angle of @xmath57 deg and a collimation - corrected energy of ( @xmath58erg . thus , grb071010a is also fully consistent with the @xmath59 ( ghirlanda ) relation @xcite .",
    "this evidence further supports that the possibly achromatic break observed in the afterglow light curve is due to collimated emission .",
    "finally , if we fit the time - averaged spectrum of grb071010a with a cut - off power law with index fixed at @xmath60 , we can constrain the cosmological rest - frame peak energy to 32@xmath61kev .",
    "this value , combined with the values of @xmath53 and @xmath62 derived above , make the representative point for grb071010a consistent with the best - fit power law of both the @xmath63 and @xmath59 relations , thus reinforcing the above considerations .",
    "almost coincident with the achromatic break , we obtained polarimetric observations , providing a rather robust upper limit ( 0.9% at 95% , 1.3% at 3@xmath22 ) suggesting null polarisation .",
    "polarimetric measurements of grb optical afterglows have been performed for several events @xcite . in general ,",
    "the polarisation level was moderate ( 23% ) , although in a few cases evidence for variations related to the afterglow evolution was found @xcite .",
    "the simple detection of variable polarization , intrinsically related to the afterglow emission , is still one of the most important observational tests in favour of the external relativistic shock model with physical beaming , where some degree of polarisation is naturally expected @xcite .",
    "almost all of the observations have been performed with the goal of disentangling the geometry of the outflow using time - resolved polarimetry .",
    "after an initial period of enthusiasm , the required intense and delicate observational efforts and the high degree of complexity of the afterglow light curves provided by _ swift",
    "_ cast some doubts on the actual possibility of deriving meaningful constraints from simple models @xcite .",
    "these proved to be applicable only to smooth , regular , afterglow light curves .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed that the polarisation degree and position - angle evolution is strongly dependent on the assumed jet structure .",
    "at least in a couple of cases a homogeneous jet geometry could be formally ruled out : i.e. for grb020813 @xcite and for grb030328 @xcite .",
    "the diagnostic power of time - resolved polarimetric observations relies on the strong coupling between the assumed jet geometry and polarization signature . for homogeneous jets",
    "there should be two polarization maxima , before and after the jet - break time , with a rotation of the position angle by 90@xmath64 . for structured jets , ( i.e. , jets with a more energetic core and fainter wings ) ,",
    "the maximum of polarization should almost be coincident with the jet - break time , and the polarization angle constant .",
    "therefore , a polarimetric measurement almost coincident with a jet break , as in the case for grb071010a , is of remarkable value .",
    "the very low upper limit that we have obtained ( sect.[sec : dana ] ) argues against a structured jet .",
    "however , the lack of time - resolved polarimetry through the evolution of the afterglow prevents us from drawing firm conclusions .",
    "the polarised fraction for the radiation emitted by an afterglow depends basically on the degree of asymmetry of the system , which in turn depends on the line of sight of the observer with respect to the jet symmetry axis . with a single observation the possibility of a very small offset angle",
    "can not be ruled out .",
    "setting aside the jet - break hypothesis , it is still true that , whichever physical process is responsible for the ( achromatic ) steepening observed in the afterglow at about 1d , it generated radiation with only a very low level of polarization .",
    "the same is true if we model the rebrightening at about 0.6d with a fast rise exponential decline pulse dominating the afterglow luminosity for the pulse duration .",
    "our campaign on grb071010a is an example of extensive monitoring of a grb afterglow in the optical / nir .",
    "this allowed us to detect an initial rising phase which can be interpreted as the afterglow onset .",
    "the peak time is rather late , about 7min after the grb .",
    "this would directly imply a relatively small initial lorentz factor although still within the fireball model expectations .",
    "interesting features are the rebrightening at @xmath65d followed by an achromatic break @xmath45d after the burst .",
    "the steepening is observed both in the optical / nir and in the x - rays bands , a feature seldom observed even in the _ swift _ era .",
    "the spectral and temporal relations before and after the break are roughly consistent with the predictions of the afterglow synchrotron external shock model with a cooling - break in between the optical / nir and x - ray bands and assuming also continuous energy injection .",
    "the rebrightening episode can be interpreted as being due to the occurrence of a refreshed shock injecting energy in the system comparably to the original energy content of the fireball .",
    "other explanations are still possible , relating the rebrightening to the density profile of the circumburst medium or to structured jets .",
    "the optical / nir spectral energy distribution requires absorption in the host - galaxy satisfactorily modeled with the smc extinction curve .",
    "grb071010a is consistent with the amati relation and , if the achromatic steepening is interpreted as a jet break , it is consistent with the ghirlanda relation too .",
    "independent of the emission process , the entire afterglow evolution is consistent with being independent of color from about 2min up to a few days .",
    "the sed is consistent with synchrotron emission and requires rest - frame absorption both in the x - rays and in the optical / nir .",
    "we also performed a polarimetric observation almost in coincidence with the occurrence of the achromatic break .",
    "a tight ( 0.9% ) upper limit was derived . in the absence of time - resolved polarimetry",
    ", we can not rule out that this afterglow was characterized by a low level of polarization throughout its evolution .    finally , the rich dataset of this burst and the simultaneous availability of multi - wavelength data is a positive example of a new approach we are trying to apply to grbs localized by _ swift _ , favouring more complete coverage of a few well - studied grbs .",
    "in addition , the observation of an initial rising phase , a rebrightening episode , and an achromatic break , as well as the availability of a well - sampled broad - band energy distribution , could offer a valuable workbench for alternative interpretative scenarios such as the  cannonball \" @xcite , the  fireshell \" @xcite , and the `` quark nova '' @xcite models in order to reach a better understanding of grb afterglow phenomenology .",

    "<S> we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaign devoted to grb071010a , a long - duration gamma - ray burst detected by the _ </S>",
    "<S> swift _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> this event was followed for almost a month in the optical / near - infrared ( nir ) with various telescopes starting from about 2min after the high - energy event . _ swift_-xrt observations started only later at about 0.4d . </S>",
    "<S> the light - curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phase with a maximum at about 7min , possibly the afterglow onset in the context of the standard fireball model , which is then followed by a smooth decay interrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d . </S>",
    "<S> the rebrightening was visible in both the optical / nir and x - rays and can be interpreted as an episode of discrete energy injection , although various alternatives are possible . </S>",
    "<S> a steepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d . </S>",
    "<S> the entire evolution of the optical / nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic . </S>",
    "<S> this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic break in the x - ray through the optical / nir bands . </S>",
    "<S> polarimetry was also obtained at about 1d , just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with the steepening . </S>",
    "<S> this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for the polarized - flux fraction .    </S>",
