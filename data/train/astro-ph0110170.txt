    "in this contribution we report on the first results of a new spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the coma cluster . this survey was designed to have three main characteristics:1 ) it extends over almost 7 mag in galaxy luminosity ( @xmath0 ) , well into the dwarf regime .",
    "in fact , this is by far the largest spectroscopic sample of cluster dwarf galaxies to date.2 ) it covers two areas of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 mpc ) towards the center and the southwest region of coma .",
    "the photometry ( b and r ) has been obtained with the japanese mosaic ccd camera at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) in collaboration with m. doi , m. , iye , n.kashikawa , y. komiyama , s. okamura , m. sekiguchi , k. , shimasaku , m. yagi , n. yasuda.3 ) it is essentially a magnitude limited sample , without significant color or morphological bias , therefore it includes galaxies of all hubble types.we obtained multifiber spectra with the wyffos fibre spectrograph at the wht for about 300 galaxies members of coma and 200 field galaxies . the spectra cover the central 2.2 arcsec ( 1.3 kpc ) of the galaxies and have a mean s / n ranging from 16 for the brightest subset to 8 for the faintest subset .",
    "hence , the errorbars on the spectral line measurements are large for the faint galaxies , and for them only broad conclusions regarding ages and metallicities can be reached .    _ here we consider only the @xmath4 galaxies without emission lines in their spectra . _ for them , we have measured the absorption line indices in the lick system .",
    "the stellar properties ( luminosity weighted ages and metallicities ) have been derived from index - index diagrams , comparing with spectrophometric models based on the padova isochrones ( http://astro.sau.edu/~worthey/dial/dial_a_pad.html , worthey ) .",
    "a full description of the results presented here can be found in papers iii and iv .",
    "the dataset is described in papers i and ii .",
    "there are 19 ellipticals and 33 s0s in our sample with a secure morphological classification from dressler ( 1980 ) .",
    "all but one of the ellipticals are consistent with luminosity weighted ages @xmath5 gyr , while 13 s0s have ages @xmath6 gyr ( fig .  1 , left ) .",
    "thus , a significant fraction ( @xmath7% ) of the s0s show evidence for some recent sf .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that they evolved from star - forming spirals that were accreted onto the cluster and had their sf truncated at intermediate redshifts ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 , fasano et al .",
    "2000 , see also van dokkum and treu in these proceedings ) .",
    "this difference in age spread between es and s0s is similar to the results of kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) in the fornax cluster and smail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in a2218 .",
    "in contrast , other works ( e.g. jones , smail & couch 2000 , ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) have not found a statistically significant difference between the ages of the stars in s0s and es .",
    "it is obviously important to understand whether s0s with recent sf are a _",
    "common _ phenomenon in clusters or not . in this respect , it is interesting to look at the age distributions of galaxies as a function of magnitude .    in fig .  1 ( right )",
    ", the population of s0s with recent sf is noticeable below the dotted line : only 4 of the `` young '' s0s are brighter than @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , considering galaxies brighter and fainter than @xmath8 , bright and faint es have similar age distributions , while the fraction of s0s with recent sf is higher at fainter luminosities .",
    "therefore , a possible reason for the discrepant results found so far ( recent sf in cluster s0s , yes or no ) could be the luminosity range explored by the different studies . given the luminosity function of spirals at @xmath9 and the expected fading if their sf is halted , the great majority of the spirals evolved into s0s should be typically fainter than @xmath10 .",
    "in the following we will consider the complete spectroscopic sample with no emission lines , including galaxies of all magnitudes and hubble types .",
    "this sample represents the total cluster population of galaxies without current sf.there is a broad range of ages , from younger than 3 gyr to older than 9 gyr , among galaxies of any magnitude .",
    "however , there are systematic trends of age with galaxy magnitude . dividing all galaxies into four magnitude bins ,",
    "@xmath11 % of galaxies in any bin are `` old '' , i.e. with no sign of sf during the last 9 gyr ( at @xmath1 ) . as shown in fig .  2 , the proportion of _ luminous _ galaxies that are passive at z=0 and that experienced a sf activity at intermediate redshift ( @xmath12 ) is 30 to 50 % , and it is higher than the fraction of _ dwarf _ galaxies that were active at that epoch .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of current / recent sf in a large number of galaxies in intermediate - z clusters ( e.g. dressler et al .",
    "1999 ) . at low redshift , instead , sf involved a higher fraction of faint than bright galaxies .",
    "these results can be used to trace the infall history of galaxies onto coma , and the consequent star formation history of its present - day galaxies .",
    "the luminosity(mass ) dependence of the most recent sf epoch points to a `` down - sizing effect '' , and can be compared with the accretion history of clusters predicted by cosmological models .",
