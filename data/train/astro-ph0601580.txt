    "all galaxies with bulges probably host massive black holes ( mbhs ) in their centers .",

    "hills called stars ejected with @xmath51,000 km s@xmath2 velocities `` hypervelocity stars .",
    "'' hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) are thus a natural consequence of the presence of a massive black hole in a dense stellar environment .",
    "@xcite reported the first discovery of a hvs : a @xmath6 late - b type star , @xmath3110 kpc distant in the galactic halo , traveling with a galactic rest - frame velocity of at least @xmath7 km s@xmath2 ( heliocentric radial velocity + 853 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "photometric follow - up revealed that the object is a slowly pulsating b main sequence star @xcite .",
    "only interaction with a mbh can plausibly accelerate a 3 @xmath8 main sequence b star to such an extreme velocity .",
    "our hvs discovery inspired a wealth of work from both observers and theorists .",
    "@xcite report a 8 @xmath8 main sequence b star , @xmath360 kpc distant , traveling with a galactic rest - frame velocity of at least @xmath9 km s@xmath2 that may be a hvs ejected from the lmc .",
    "@xcite report a helium - rich subluminous o star , @xmath320 kpc distant , traveling with a galactic rest - frame velocity of at least @xmath10 km s@xmath2 that is probably a hvs ejected from the galactic center .",
    "@xcite suggest that outliers in the velocity distribution of intracluster planetary nebulae around m87 may be hvss . in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of two more hvss from our ongoing hvs survey .    with hvss now an observed class of objects , it is important to define true hvss . run - away b stars located many kpc above the galactic plane have long been known , but their velocities are typically @xmath11 km s@xmath2 and they are very probably bound to the galaxy .",
    "hvss , on the other hand , are unbound .",
    "more importantly , the classical supernova ejection @xcite and dynamical ejection @xcite mechanisms that explain run - away b stars can not produce ejection velocities which exceed @xmath3300 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus we define a hvs as an unbound star with an extreme velocity that can be explained so far only by dynamical ejection associated with a mbh .",
    "hvss are important tools for understanding the nature and environs of mbhs : @xcite predict that a thin torus of ejected hvss is the signature of two mbhs forming a tight binary .",
    "@xcite suggest that the stars on highly eccentric orbits around sgra@xmath12 may be the former companion stars to hvss ejected by the mbh .",
    "@xcite shows that an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) on a circular in - spiral into the galactic center produces an isotropic burst of hvss ; an imbh on an eccentric in - spiral produces broad jets of hvss .",
    "@xcite find that hvss produced from stellar binary encounters with single mbhs have higher ejection velocities than hvss from binary mbhs .",
    "@xcite show that the distance and full space motion of hvss can provide significant constraints on the shape and orientation of the galactic dark matter halo .",
    "@xcite expand hill s original analysis and show that single star encounters with binary mbhs produce @xmath310 times more hvss than stellar binary encounters with single mbhs .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our survey target selection and observations . in  3 we present the new hvss .",
    "we conclude in  4 by discussing what the observed set of hvss implies about their origin and the nature of the galactic center .",
    "hvss ought to be rare : @xcite predict there should be @xmath310@xmath13 hvss in the entire galaxy .",
    "thus , in any search for hvss , survey volume is important .",
    "solar neighborhood surveys have not discovered hvss because , even if they were perfectly complete to a depth of @xmath14 kpc , there is a @xmath30.1% chance of finding a hvs in such a small volume . finding a new hvs among the galaxy s @xmath310@xmath15 stars",
    "also requires selection of targets with a high probability of being hvss .",
    "our observational strategy is two - fold . because the density of stars in the galactic halo drops off as approximately @xmath16 , and the density of hvss drops off as @xmath17 ( if they are produced at a constant rate ) , we target distant stars where the contrast between the density of hvss and indigenous stars is as large as possible . secondly , the stellar halo contains mostly old , late - type stars .",
    "thus we target faint b - type stars , stars with lifetimes consistent with travel times from the galactic center but which are not a normally expected stellar halo population .",
    "this strategy makes sense because 90% of the @xmath18 stars in the central @xmath19 of the galactic center are in fact normal main sequence b stars @xcite .",
    "we use sdss photometry to select candidate b stars by color . to illustrate the color selection , fig .",
    "[ fig : ugr ] shows a color - color diagram of every star with @xmath20 and b- and a - type colors in the sdss dr4 @xcite .",

    "the dashed box indicates the selection region used by @xcite to identify bhb candidates .",
    "interestingly , there is a faint group of stars with late b - type colors extending up the stellar sequence towards the ensemble of white dwarfs with @xmath22 .",
    "we select candidate b stars inside the solid parallelogram defined by : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we observed a complete sample of 79 candidate b stars in the 1900 deg@xmath4 region of the sdss dr4 bounded by @xmath25 and dec @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ fig : sky ] displays the locations of the objects on the sky . the @xcite hvs is located in this region on the sky , but it is not a part of our survey because its photometric colors lie far outside of our selection box .",
    "our sample of candidate b stars is 100% complete in the magnitude range @xmath27 .",
    "observations were obtained 2005 december 3 - 5 with the blue channel spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt telescope .",
    "the spectrograph was operated with the 832 line / mm grating in second order , providing 1.2   spectral resolution and wavelength coverage 3660   to 4500  .",
    "exposure times ranged from 5 to 30 minutes and were chosen to yield @xmath28 in the continuum at 4000  .",
    "comparison lamp exposures were after obtained after every exposure .",
    "radial velocities were measured using the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "the average uncertainty is @xmath29 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we correct the heliocentric velocities to the local standard of rest @xcite and remove the 220 km s@xmath2 solar reflex motion .",
    "thus all velocities reported here are in the galactic rest frame , indicated @xmath30 .",
    "the velocities of the candidate b stars are indicated by color in fig.[fig : sky ] .          our sample of 79 targets",
    "is composed of 61 late b - type stars , 16 faint da white dwarfs , and 2 low-@xmath31 galaxies .",
    "we derive spectral types of the late b - type stars based on line indices described in @xcite ; the types range from b6 to a1 .",
    "thus our target selection is 77% efficient for selecting stars of late b spectral type .",
    "changing the color selection edge from @xmath32 to @xmath33 would eliminate more than half of the white dwarfs and one of the galaxies , and would increase the target selection efficiency for late b - type stars to 90% .",
    "we plan to publish the faint white dwarfs and other unusual objects in a future paper describing the hvs survey as a whole .",
    "our targeted search for hvss uncovered two new hvss , sdss j091301.0 + 305120 ( hereafter hvs4 ) and sdss j091759.5 + 672238 ( hereafter hvs5 ) .",

    "@xmath37 km s@xmath2 ) , respectively , and are 5-@xmath38 outliers from this distribution . the escape velocity of the galaxy is approximately 300 km s@xmath2 at 50 kpc @xcite ; thus hvs4 and hvs5 are clearly unbound to the galaxy .    the new hvss are not physically associated with any other local group galaxy .",
    "hvs4 and hvs5 are located at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sky ] ) .",
    "hvs4 is separated from leo a by 10@xmath41 on the sky , but the galaxy is in the distant background 800 kpc away @xcite .",
    "even if hvs4 were a @xmath42 supergiant at the distance of leo a , the star s radial velocity differs from leo a by 575 km s@xmath2 . the closest galaxy to hvs5 is the ursa minor dwarf 31@xmath41 away , yet",
    "the velocity difference is even more extreme at 730 km s@xmath2 .",
    "both hvs4 and hvs5 have spectral types consistent with b8 , however our low - resolution spectra do not allow us to determine exact stellar parameters .",
    "stars of this spectral type are likely blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars or main sequence b stars / blue stragglers .",
    "two of the three previously reported hvss are main sequence b stars @xcite .",
    "we note that the balmer line widths of hvs4 and hvs5 are too broad to be consistent with those of b i supergiants . if we assume the hvss are bhb stars rather than b stars , their blue colors",
    "means they are hot , extreme bhb stars and thus they are intrinsically very faint .",
    "the @xmath43 relation of @xcite yields @xmath44 and @xmath45 and heliocentric distance estimates @xmath4620 and 18 kpc for hvs4 and hvs5 , respectively . in the bhb interpretation ,",
    "the volume we effectively survey is much smaller than in the b star interpretation . thus the bhb interpretation requires more than an order of magnitude larger production rate for hvss .",
    "because two of the previous hvs are b stars and because the b star interpretation implies a lower production rate probably consistent with @xcite , we assume that hvs4 and hvs are b stars for the purpose of discussion .",
    "the ultimate discriminant will come from higher resolution , higher signal - to - noise spectroscopy .",
    "we estimate the luminosity of a b8 star from the @xcite stellar evolution tracks for a 4 @xmath8 star with @xmath47 .",
    "such a star spends 160 myr on the main sequence and produces 400 @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to @xmath50 ( using bolometric correction @xmath51 @xcite ) and heliocentric distances @xmath52 and 55 kpc for hvs4 and hvs5 , respectively . assuming the sun is 8 kpc distant from the galactic center , the galacto - centric distances of hvs4 and hvs5 are thus @xmath53 and 60 kpc , respectively .",
    "if hvs4 and hvs5 originate from the galactic center , the travel times to their present locations are approximately 140 and 90 myr , respectively , consistent with the 160 myr main sequence lifetime of a 4 @xmath8 star . if the hvss are bhbs or blue stragglers , their lifetimes are considerably longer and the travel time constraint is relaxed .",
    "our radial velocities provide only a _ lower _ limit to the hvs s true space velocities .",
    "hvs4 and hvs5 have bright apparent magnitudes ( @xmath54 and 17.93 , respectively ) and are present in the usnob1 @xcite and gsc2.3 ( b.  mclean , 2006 private communication ) catalogs . however , the hvss are listed with no measurable proper motions , consistent with the estimated distances .",
    "table [ tab : hvs ] summarizes the properties of all five known hvss .",
    "the columns include hvs number , galactic coordinates @xmath55 , apparent magnitude @xmath56 , minimum galactic rest - frame velocity @xmath30 ( not a full space velocity ) , heliocentric distance estimate @xmath57 , travel time estimate from the galactic center @xmath58 , and catalog identification .",
    "we note that the b9 @xmath59 estimate was incorrect in @xcite and should be @xmath60 .",
    "thus the correct distance and travel time estimates to hvs1 are @xmath61110 kpc and @xmath62 myr , as indicated .",
    "the very existence of the hvss places interesting limits on the stellar mass function of hvss , the origin of massive stars in the galactic center , and the history of stellar interactions with the mbh .",
    "interestingly , all five known hvss are moving with positive radial velocity , consistent with the picture of a galactic center origin .    in principle",
    ", we can constrain the stellar population from which the hvss originate by combining predictions of hvs rates with the results of our survey . @xcite",
    "predict a hvs rate of @xmath310@xmath63 yr@xmath2 ejected by a single mbh at the galactic center .",
    "a hvs moving 600 km s@xmath2 travels 120 kpc in 200 myr , thus the @xcite rate implies @xmath32000 hvss of all types to a depth of 120 kpc .",
    "our @xmath64 magnitude - limited survey reaches the same depth @xmath65 kpc for b8 stars and we find two b8 hvss over our 1900 deg@xmath4 region , implying @xmath66 b8 hvss over the entire sky .",
    "we ask whether this number of b stars is consistent with the number expected from a standard initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "a salpeter imf @xcite , integrated over the mass range 0.2 - 100 @xmath8 and normalized to 2000 stars , contains 26 stars between 3 and 5 @xmath8 .",
    "a scalo imf @xcite , similarly calculated , contains 13 stars between 3 and 5 @xmath8 .",
    "the imf predictions are systematically lower than the observed frequency implied by the two b stars in our survey , but because of small number statistics there is no significant inconsistency .    in the galactic center , there is some indication that the imf is top heavy . for example , @xcite study the mass - segregated arches cluster and argue for truncation at masses less than 6 @xmath8 . integrating the @xcite mass function @xmath67 over the mass range 3 - 100 @xmath8 and normalizing it to 2000 stars results in 750 3 - 5 @xmath8 stars , an order of magnitude more late - b hvss than implied by our observations .",
    "thus our observations already indicate that the hvs parent population is not composed entirely of clusters like arches or the @xcite hvs rate is an underestimate .",
    "hvs travel times from the galactic center constrain the history of stellar interactions with the mbh . assuming the new hvss are b stars , travel time estimates for the known hvss are spread rather uniformly between 30 and 160 myr .",
    "thus there is as yet no evidence for a burst of hvss from major in - fall event at the galactic center in the last @xmath3160 myr .",
    "the current constraints are less clear if hvs4 or hvs5 are not b stars .",
    "if new discoveries of hvss continue to show no evidence for coherent bursts of hvss , theories of in - falling massive star clusters @xcite possibly containing an imbh @xcite to transport b stars near the mbh may not be applicable to the galaxy .",
    "it is interesting that the northern hvss all have similar @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sky ] ) .",
    "an in - spiraling binary black hole produces an unique distribution of hvss on the sky @xcite .",
    "detailed theoretical predictions of the distribution of hvss on the sky ejected by a single mbh at the galactic center would be an important testbed for future hvs observations .",
    "hvss are becoming important tools for understanding mbhs . discovering additional hvss in a well - defined volume",
    "will provide better constraints on the origin of hvss and the nature of the galactic center .",
    "proper motion measurements of hvss , measured with the _ hubble space telescope _ , the _ global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics _ , or the _ space interferometry mission _ , may provide significant constraints on the shape of the galaxy s dark matter potential @xcite . the distribution of hvss in velocity and space may constrain the history of stellar interactions with the mbh . identifying hvss around other galaxies",
