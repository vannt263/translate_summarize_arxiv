    "flavor mixing for sleptons and sneutrinos is fully implemented ; flavor mixing for squarks is not included .",
    "there are two flavor problems in particle physics . the standard model ( sm ) flavor problem is the unexplained pattern of sm fermion masses .",
    "in addition , there is the new physics flavor problem , that is , the difficulty of solving the gauge hierarchy problem , which inevitably requires the introduction of new particles at the weak scale , without generically violating well - known low - energy flavor constraints .",
    "future colliders , including the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , may shed light on both the sm and the new physics flavor problems .",
    "unfortunately , the potential of the lhc in this regard is not well explored , in part because simulations of new physics typically focus on the simplest possibilities in which flavor violation is absent . in this paper",
    ", we describe a new tool , spice : simulation package for including flavor in collider events , which is intended as a first step toward addressing this problem .    in more detail",
    ", there are several motivations for developing collider event simulation tools for models with non - trivial flavor physics :    * in many new physics frameworks , such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions , new states are predicted that are governed by the same flavor or horizontal symmetries as the sm fermions .",
    "understanding their masses and mixings may therefore lead to real progress in identifying the theory of flavor . *",
    "although the new physics may be minimally flavor violating , this is by no means required by current constraints ; see , for example , refs .  @xcite .",
    "as lhc data become available , it is appropriate to relax theoretical constraints and consider more general frameworks , especially if they yield unusual signals . * the exploration of new physics",
    "is often said to consist of three phases : particle discovery , measurement of particle masses , and measurement of flavor and other mixings . in reality , these stages are unlikely to be completely distinct , and the exploration of flavor effects may provide new opportunities for particle discovery or proceed in parallel with precision mass measurements .",
    "* there are many promising probes of flavor violation at low energies .",
    "if a positive signal appears in one of them , for example , @xmath0 , there will be great interest in understanding whether new weak - scale physics can explain it . in this scenario ,",
    "a program like spice will be helpful to understand what flavor - violating effects are observed or observable at colliders . *",
    "finally , searches for new physics often implicitly assume the ( near ) absence of flavor violation .",
    "it is important to test their robustness in the presence of flavor violation .",
    "although spice is flexible in several ways , in its typical form spice reads in parameters for one of the standard flavor - conserving supersymmetric models and lepton flavor - violating ( lfv ) masses specified by the user .",
    "spice uses the flavor - conserving model as a spine , then includes the corrections from lfv terms , determines the new superpartner masses and mass eigenstates , calculates branching ratios for all relevant flavor - conserving and flavor - violating decay modes , and outputs the results in herwig  @xcite and susy les houches accord ( slha and slha2 )  @xcite format files , which may be used to generate collider events .",
    "spice uses softsusy  @xcite to evolve supersymmetric parameters through renormalization group equations and uses susyhit  @xcite to calculate flavor - conserving decay widths",
    ".    the flavor - conserving model may be any of the standard ones , for example minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , minimal gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( mgmsb ) , or anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking supplemented by a universal scalar mass ( mamsb ) .",
    "we review these and their input parameters below .    the lfv may be specified in a number of ways . at the `` highest , '' most model - dependent level , a user may specify a horizontal global symmetry @xcite , the charges of each of the supermultiplets under this symmetry , and the froggatt - nielsen expansion parameter @xmath1 .",
    "spice then populates each lfv mass matrix with entries that have the appropriate powers of @xmath1 , multiplied by randomly - chosen @xmath2 coefficients . at a slightly lower level ,",
    "the user may specify each of the @xmath2 coefficients by hand . and finally , at the lowest and most model - independent level , a user may specify every lfv term by hand .",
    "supersymmetric models with lfv are , of course , just some of the many possibilities for non - trivial flavor physics at the lhc .",
    "we are led to consider lfv in supersymmetric models for a variety of reasons .",
    "supersymmetry is well - motivated by the gauge hierarchy problem and force unification , both with and without gravity , and there exist supersymmetric flavor models that can both explain the observed charged lepton and neutrino masses and mixings and simultaneously solve the new physics flavor problem .",
    "in addition , and perhaps most important for the coming data - driven era , supersymmetry is flexible enough to encompass many diverse experimental signatures , and lepton flavor violation , as opposed to quark flavor violation , generically has obvious implications for observable experimental signatures and event topologies .",
    "that said , it would certainly also be interesting to study hadronic flavor violation , particularly that involving the 3rd generation , and to generalize these results to non - supersymmetric frameworks .",
    "a recent study of the observability of squark flavor violation at the lhc was done in ref .",

    "we also present a simple example input file and the resulting output .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "further details regarding our conventions , lagrangian terms , decay widths , and program details are given in a series of appendices .",
    "the user inputs to spice consist of a flavor - conserving susy spine supplemented by lfv terms .",
    "the flavor - conserving susy spine may be any model normally available in softsusy @xcite , though in principle any model could be input with appropriate alterations to the softsusy code .",
    "the base options and their input parameters are the following :    * minimal supergravity ( msugra ) is specified by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the universal scalar , gaugino , and tri - linear scalar coupling parameters at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the sign of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath12 . *",
    "minimal gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( mgmsb ) is specified by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of @xmath15 multiplets in the messenger sector , @xmath16 is the messenger mass scale , @xmath17 sets the mass scale for the sm superpartners , @xmath18 is the gravitino mass in units of its mass in the minimal case in which there is only one susy - breaking @xmath19 term , and @xmath20 and @xmath11 are as above . *",
    "minimal anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( mamsb ) is specified by @xmath21 where @xmath6 is the universal scalar mass , motivated by the tachyonic slepton problem and added to all scalars , including the higgs scalars , @xmath22 is the gravitino mass , which sets the scale for all sm superpartners , and @xmath20 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 are as above .",
    "the lfv terms are specified by a parameter @xmath23 and three @xmath24 matrices @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "all of these matrices are assumed real , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are necessarily symmetric . in the most model - independent formulation accommodated by spice ,",
    "lfv is therefore completely specified by 22 numbers : @xmath23 , 9 for @xmath25 , 6 for @xmath26 , and 6 for @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 is the sm charged lepton mass matrix . @xmath26 and @xmath27 determine the slepton mass matrices through @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the flavor - conserving contributions to the left- and right - handed sleptons , and @xmath31 characterizes the size of flavor - conserving contributions to the slepton masses .",
    "for concreteness we take @xmath31 to be equal to the average of the diagonal elements of @xmath29 .",
    "is thus equal to the average left slepton mass - squared . ]",
    "the parameter @xmath23 specifies the size of the lfv effects relative to the flavor - conserving parameters .",
    "several simplifying assumptions are encoded in this formulation of the lfv effects :    1 .   in assuming @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are real",
    ", we do not include cp violation from these matrices .",
    "2 .   the flavor - violating contributions to left- and right - handed sleptons are of the same order , as set by @xmath32 .",
    "this is what one would expect of gravitational contributions , which are chirality - blind .",
    "3 .   in general",
    ", there should also be lfv @xmath33-terms .",
    "we assume these are negligible at the mass scale where these susy - breaking masses are generated .",
    "note , however , that @xmath33-terms are generated through rg evolution , and such effects are included .",
    "4 .   in general , there should also be a non - trivial lfv neutrino mass matrix .",
    "however , since we are primarily interested in colliders , where neutrino flavor is unobservable , we simply assume that the neutrino masses vanish , and so the neutrino mass and gauge eigenstates are identical .",
    "note that sneutrinos may have observable mixings , and these are included .",
    "an attractive possibility is that the lfv terms are determined by horizontal symmetries . in this approach ,",
    "the 3 lfv matrices are @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lepton mass scale , the @xmath36 are @xmath37 coefficients , @xmath1 is the froggatt - nielsen expansion parameter , and the exponents @xmath38 are determined by supermultiplet charges .",
    "spice accommodates this possibility by providing an alternative way to specify the lfv parameters in the case of @xmath39 flavor models , with breaking parameters of the same size .",
    "for example , for @xmath40 , one sets @xmath41 , and specifies the two u(1 ) charges for the six multiplets @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "spice then determines the correct exponent @xmath38 for each entry of the three matrices .",
    "spice may also determine the coefficients @xmath36 randomly or these may be set by the user .      once the flavor - conserving and flavor - violating parameters are input , the model is completely specified .",
    "formally , one should then evolve the mass parameters from the scale they are generated , adding in new contributions at the appropriate scale , until one reaches the weak scale . in spice , we instead add the lfv contributions to the flavor - conserving contributions at the scale at which the flavor - conserving contributions are generated , and then rg evolve the result to the weak scale . in the case",
    "that the flavor - conserving and lfv contributions are generated at the same scale , as in the case of msugra or mamsb spines with lfv generated at @xmath9 , this is the correct prescription .",
    "if the generation scales differ , for example , as in the case of a mgmsb spine with gravity - mediated lfv effects , our prescription is not formally correct . even in this case , however , we expect that the dominant difference resulting from this approximation may be absorbed into the lfv @xmath37 parameters , which are not completely specified anyway .",
    "given the slepton masses and mixings determined above , we then calculate all branching ratios involving these lfv effects .",
    "most of the flavor - violating decay widths are , at least to tree level , fairly simple generalizations of the flavor - conserving widths .",
    "new effects appear in the 3-body decays of sleptons both to like - sign leptons , @xmath4 , and to opposite - sign leptons , @xmath48 .",
    "previous work on these decays  @xcite has assumed flavor conservation . in the presence of lfv , however , the lepton pair may be identical particles or charge conjugates of the same generation , leading to additional interference terms .",
    "we have calculated these decay widths in the presence of lfv and arbitrary left - right slepton mixing in another work  @xcite and included these in spice .",
    "currently spice discards decays to gravitinos .",
    "such decays are typically either kinematically inaccessible or too slow to be relevant at colliders . even in the cases where the model used for the spine predicts fast decays to gravitinos , as in the case of mgmsb with a low supersymmetry - breaking scale ,",
    "the existence of significant lfv contributions implies that in the full lfv theory , supersymmetry is broken at a high scale , and decays to gravitinos are negligible .",
    "the program is designed to take in one input file which specifies all of the input parameters . this file , by default , is called spiceinit and is located in the spice/ directory .",
    "the default input file is identical to the example input file presented below .",
    "these input parameters are used by softsusy @xcite to generate a particle mass spectrum , which is passed to susyhit  @xcite to create a susy les houches accord ( slha ) file with the traditional flavor - conserving decay table .",
    "decay widths of the flavor - generalized decay channels involving sleptons and sneutrinos are calculated separately within the softsusy executable , which generates an intermediate file containing the flavor - generalized mass spectrum and relevant decays .",
    "the filecombine subprogram merges the susyhit output with this intermediate file to generate the file herwigfinal.out , which is an input file for the herwig event generator @xcite and both slhafinal.out and slha2final.out , which are slha @xcite and slha2  @xcite formatted files appropriate for input to monte carlo event generators .",

    "<S> we describe spice : simulation package for including flavor in collider events . </S>",
    "<S> spice takes as input two ingredients : a standard flavor - conserving supersymmetric spectrum and a set of flavor - violating slepton mass parameters , both of which are specified at some high `` mediation '' scale . </S>",
    "<S> spice then combines these two ingredients to form a flavor - violating model , determines the resulting low - energy spectrum and branching ratios , and outputs herwig and susy leshouches files , which may be used to generate collider events . </S>",
    "<S> the flavor - conserving model may be any of the standard supersymmetric models , including minimal supergravity , minimal gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking , and anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking supplemented by a universal scalar mass . </S>",
    "<S> the flavor - violating contributions may be specified in a number of ways , from specifying charges of fields under horizontal symmetries to completely specifying all flavor - violating parameters . </S>",
    "<S> spice is fully documented and publicly available , and is intended to be a user - friendly aid in the study of flavor at the large hadron collider and other future colliders . </S>"
