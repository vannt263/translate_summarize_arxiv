    "outstanding questions about the three - dimensional structure of stellar winds continue to plague our understanding of mass - loss processes from stars .",
    "although much has been accomplished toward understanding the gross properties of stellar winds in terms of theories for spherically symmetric mass - loss ( a description of current understanding along with copious references in this regard can be found in lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) , a complete physical description of two and three dimensional effects remains elusive .",
    "there have been notable advances in a number of areas , with a brief and incomplete listing to include such studies as axisymmetric models of magnetized thermally driven winds ( sakurai 1985 ; washimi & shibata 1993 ; sean & balick 2004 ) , axisymmetric line - driven winds with rotation ( e.g. , bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ; owocki , cranmer , & gayley 1996 ; petrenz & puls 2000 ) , axisymmetric magnetized line - driven winds ( poe , friend , & cassinelli 1989 ; brown  2004 ; ud - doula & owocki 2002 ; townsend & owocki 2005 ) , axisymmetric dust - driven winds ( asida & tuchman 1995 ; dorfi & hfner 1996 ; soker 2000 ) , and time - dependent spherical or time - averaged spherical models ( feldmeier 1995 ; dessart & owocki 2002 ; runacres & owocki 2002 , 2005 ) . the challenge has been that to include all of the relevant physics could require multi - dimensional radiative ( magneto-)hydrodynamics . despite the difficulties involved , semi - analytic and detailed numerical models have been inspired by a large volume of observations that exhibit behavior that the steady - state spherical models are unable to explain .",
    "the examples are numerous , such as the triple rings of the sn1987a remnant ( crotts , kunkel , & mccarthy 1989 ; burrows  1995 ; sugerman  2005 ) , the fact that the majority of planetary nebulae and luminous blue variables are aspherical ( balick 1987 ; nota  1995 ; davies , oudmaijer , & vink 2005 ) , the existence of discs in the be and b[e ] stars ( see the review of be stars by porter & rivinius 2003 ; see the recent proceedings on b[e ] stars by kraus & miroshnichenko 2006 ) , discrete absorption components and related phenomena seen in hot star wind lines ( howarth & prinja 1989 ; massa  1995 ; brown  1995 ; lepine , moffat , & henriksen 1996 ) , and the inference of apparently ubiquitous clumpiness in stellar winds ( hillier 1991 ; bouret , lanz , & hillier 2005 ; fullerton , massa , & prinja 2006 ) .",
    "the goal of this contribution is to consider diagnostics of aspherical mass - loss as revealed by forbidden emission line profiles .",
    "the formation of most forbidden lines occurs over a large - scale volume of the wind .",
    "consequently , the emission profile shapes that form in the hypersonic winds of early - type stars are imprinted with the properties of the asymptotic wind structure .",
    "this is most certainly not a new concept .",
    "dating back to beals ( 1929 ) , it was appreciated that flat - topped emission profile shapes result for optically thin lines that form in a constant velocity and radially expanding flow . in a colliding wind binary ,",
    "stevens & howarth ( 1999 ) , lhrs ( 1997 ) , hill  ( 2000 ) , and hill , moffat , & st - louis ( 2002 ) have shown how time - dependent deviations from flat - top shaped profiles can be used as a tracer of the geometry of the colliding winds .    in this paper",
    "a parametric axisymmetric density distribution is adopted as a framework for modeling forbidden emission profiles as a function of the wind asymmetry and viewing inclination .",
    "in addition , we point out that the density function alone is not enough to completely determine emission profile shapes .",
    "the emissivity depends on the ionic species and its latitude dependence that is is coupled to the overall density distribution .",
    "so our model profiles also include a treatment of the influence of latitudinal ionization effects .",
    "interestingly , for a given stellar wind model , different lines can show different , even opposite , profile trends , as for example some lines show centrally - peaked emission , whereas others display double - peaked profiles .",
    "a number of simplifying assumptions are employed to focus on the general trends .",
    "the wind expansion is assumed constant for large radius and also in latitude .",
    "clumping is ignored .",
    "how clumping may vary with latitude and radius in an axisymmetric hot star wind has not been well - studied , and so we choose to avoid making _ ad hoc _ assumptions .",
    "however , the basic equations presented here can be modified to include velocity and clumping effects to study their impact on forbidden line profile shapes .",
    "section 2 presents a brief overview of forbidden line formation in spherically symmetric stellar winds .",
    "then section 3 contains a description of the axisymmetric model , and results for model forbidden line profiles are given .",
    "following is a summary and discussion of applications in section  4 .",
    "there are two appendices to conclude the paper .",
    "appendix  [ poleon ] presents an analytic solution for line profile shapes in the case of a pole - on viewing perspective of an axisymmetric wind , and appendix  [ 2lvl ] specifically shows that the two - level atom approximation that will be adopted throughout the paper applies to the particular and interesting case of neiii for wolf - rayet star conditions .",
    "our presentation of the theory of forbidden line emission generally follows the approach and to some extent the notation of osterbrock ( 1989 ) regarding the atomic physics and barlow , roche , & aitken ( 1988 ) in terms of stellar wind application .",
    "consider a fine structure transition for an ion species assuming a two - level atom only , denoting ` 1 ' for the lower level and ` 2 ' for the upper level .",
    "the level population density ( number per unit volume ) @xmath0 can be modified by collisional and radiative excitations , and the level population density @xmath1 can be modified by collisional de - excitations and spontaneous radiative decays .",
    "highly non - lte conditions exist in hot stellar winds , and so the two - level atom representation can be an excellent approximation in many cases .",
    "however , it can be the case for some atoms that there are more than two levels that can be important for the population that determines the emission for the line of interest . in the case of the wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , the lines of [ neii ] 12.8 @xmath2 m ( @xmath3 ) and [ neiii ] 15.56 @xmath2 m ( @xmath4 ) are of considerable interest for determining the abundance of neon .",
    "although , the ground state of neii is a doublet and so should be well - described by the two - level atom approximation , neiii has five low - lying levels .",
    "the particular line at 15.56 @xmath2 m happens to involve the two lowest levels of the five , and we will show later that the two - level approximation is pretty good for conditions relevant to wr stars .",
    "thus the theory that follows assumes a two - level atom throughout .",
    "it is commonly the case that radiative excitations from 1 to 2 are ignored compared to the collisional term . the radiative excitation rate ( number per volume per second )",
    "is @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the upward einstein transition probability , and @xmath7 the mean intensity at the frequency of the line transition .",
    "the collisional rate is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the electron number density and @xmath10 is the collisional excitation rate in volume per second",
    ". a ratio of these rates shows that the radiative excitation rate is indeed much smaller than the collisional rate . for the wind case",
    ", @xmath7 will decrease with radius in the wind as the dilution factor that scales as @xmath11 , and this cancels with the electron density in the denominator that will also scale in the same way .",
    "the dominant factor that remains is a ratio @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ` critical density ' and @xmath14 ( to be defined in the following section ) is a scale factor for the electron number density .",
    "the critical density is defined here as    @xmath15    in effect , the critical density represents a transition between high density regimes with @xmath16 for the line emissivity is linear in density versus low density regimes with @xmath17 for which the emissivity scales with the square of density .",
    "the volume emissivity @xmath18 ( erg s@xmath19 @xmath20 sr@xmath19 ) is given by    @xmath21    to determine @xmath1 , equilibrium conditions for the two levels are imposed as governed by the following rate expression :    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    with    @xmath24    for @xmath25 the frequency of the line transition , @xmath26 the electron temperature , and @xmath27 the statistical weight of the level , with @xmath28 .",
    "the collisional volume rate is given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the collision strength .",
    "we define @xmath31 to be the number density of element @xmath32 in ion stage @xmath33 , and we approximate its value as    @xmath34    we make the following definitions : the ion fraction for this element in this ion stage is    @xmath35    the abundance of the element relative to all nucleons is    @xmath36    for @xmath37 the number density of nucleons ; and the ratio of the nucleons to electrons is denoted    @xmath38    with these relations , the emissivity in equation  ( [ eq : emiss ] ) can be re - expressed in terms of @xmath9 instead of @xmath1 .",
    "first , equation  ( [ eq : ground ] ) is used to eliminate @xmath0 in equation  ( [ eq : bal ] ) , the result of which can be solved for @xmath1 alone , giving    @xmath39    factoring out @xmath40 , using the definition of the critical density from equation  ( [ eq : crit ] ) in conjunction with the preceding relations , we arrive at    @xmath41    at high densities for which @xmath42 , one has that @xmath43 , whereas at low densities with @xmath44 , the scaling is @xmath45 .    in barlow  ( 1988 ) , the quantity @xmath46 is defined as the _ ionic fraction _ , being the number density ratio of a particular ion of a particular atom to all ions in the gas . in our notation , one has that @xmath47 .",
    "it is desirable to derive the ionic fraction to compare against stellar evolution predictions .",
    "the ionic fraction can be inferred from the observed total flux of forbidden line emission , provided that the source distance is known .",
    "if lines from different atomic species are available , line ratios can be used to derive abundances ( or possibly limits to abundances ) even if the source distance is not well - known .",
    "it is instructive to briefly review the formation of forbidden lines in a spherical wind . for this purpose",
    "it is useful first to develop a sense of scale , to determine where the line emission is formed in the wind flow .",
    "consider a spherical wind with mass - loss rate  and radial speed @xmath48 for radius @xmath49 .",
    "the mass density will be    @xmath50    the number density will be @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the average particle mass in the wind , and @xmath2 the mean molecular weight .",
    "the electron number density is @xmath53 , for @xmath54 the mean molecular weight per free electron .",
    "similarly , the nucleon number density is @xmath55 , for @xmath56 the mean molecular weight per free nucleon . in a hot star wind that is dominated by ionized hydrogen ,",
    "the relations become @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and so @xmath60 .",
    "this would be appropriate for an o star , for example .",
    "strong forbidden lines are seen in the ir spectra of wr stars , and a wr  wind is often dominated by twice ionized helium at small radii but possibly once ionized helium at large radii ( e.g. , fig .  3 of dessart  2000",
    "shows heii is dominant for their wc8 model of wr  135 ) . assuming that helium is once ionized , the molecular weights become @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the region of line formation is roughly set by the radius at which the electron density and the critical density are equal . among hot stars the mass loss rates are around @xmath65  and larger , with terminal speeds generally around 1000  or greater from spectral type b and earlier ( e.g. , lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "we define a number density scale factor to be    @xmath66    with values from @xmath67 @xmath20 for b star winds soaring to @xmath68 @xmath20 in the case of dense wr winds .",
    "the critical density for a forbidden line depends on the electron number density , so we define a related scaling factor for the electron density :    @xmath69    typical stellar wind forbidden lines observed in wr winds have critical densities ranging from @xmath70 to @xmath67 @xmath20 ( e.g. , see tab .  5 of ignace  2001 ) . ignoring the weaker winds with quite small  values",
    ", the radius in the wind where @xmath71 occurs is expected to be very large .",
    "we can find this radius @xmath72 from @xmath73 , giving    @xmath74    with typical values of @xmath75 stellar radii .",
    "a goal of studying forbidden lines in stellar winds is to derive information about metal abundances .",
    "the observable is the total line flux that is related to the line luminosity as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the distance to the source . being an optically thin line",
    ", the total line luminosity depends on the atomic rates associated with the line transition and on the wind parameters , including the ionic fraction . with the atomic rates known , and the wind properties such as mass - loss rate and terminal speed provided , the observed line emission can be used to find the ionic fraction .",
    "the total luminosity of the optically thin line emission is given by a volume integration involving the emissivity , viz    @xmath78    defining @xmath79 , then substituting equation  ( [ eq : n2 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : emiss ] ) , and this again into equation  ( [ eq : linelum ] ) , one obtains    @xmath80    where    @xmath81    using a change of variable with @xmath82 , the integral can be re - expressed as    @xmath83    where @xmath84 .",
    "this has an analytic solution :    @xmath85    with @xmath86 a factor of order unity , and the expectation that @xmath87 , the total luminosity generated for this forbidden line is    @xmath88    which is in effect the same as equation  ( 13 ) of smith & houck ( 2005 ) , except that those authors allow for a constant clumping factor ( see our discussion of clumping in sect .  [ models ] ) . from equation  ( [ eq : ll ] )",
    "one can easily backsubstitute to obtain the product of the ion fraction and metal abundance in terms of the measured line luminosity ( for known distance ) :    @xmath89    the reader may object that our derivation is lacking an important component of the wind , namely the inner radii where the wind accelerates .",
    "we have so far tacitly assumed a constant expansion wind at @xmath90 to derive the above result . at the inner wind",
    ", the flow accelerates from some near - hydrostatic configuration at subsonic speeds to the hypersonic speeds of order @xmath91 . for a typical forbidden line and a fairly dense o or wr star wind ,",
    "the value of the critical radius is so large , that the contribution to the line flux from the very dense inner and accelerating wind region is negligible . to illustrate this , fig .",

    ", the curve is sharply dropping because of the rapidly changing velocity law .",
    "this portion is labelled the ` acceleration ' branch .",
    "interior to the critical radius ( where @xmath99 ) , the contribution function is constant , and this branch is labelled as ` flat ' . at large radius beyond the critical radius ,",
    "the emissivity drops as the square of density , where @xmath100 , and so is labelled ` linear ' .",
    "the different breaks from the flat portion are representative of forbidden lines with different critical densities , here ranging from @xmath70 @xmath20 ( break at largest radius ) to @xmath101 @xmath20 ( break at smallest radius ) .",
    "although the acceleration branch shows quite a strong contribution function , it is relegated to such a narrow range of radii as compared to the location of the critical radius , that it can safely be ignored for computing the emission line flux and profile shape .",
    "what remains is a constant velocity spherical expansion flow that forms a flat - topped emission profile , which is the standard theoretical result for this case of an optically thin line ( e.g. , mihalas 1978 ; lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "note that the flat and linear portions contribute approximately equally to the total line luminosity .",
    "with a good picture of the forbidden line formation in spherical winds in mind , the case of axisymmetric flows is now addressed . to model such winds , the following parametric forms for the wind density",
    "are adopted .",
    "we assume the wind is top - bottom symmetric in what follows . then if the equator has higher density than the pole , we use    @xmath102 ,      \\label{eq : neq}\\ ] ]    where the star is taken to have spherical coordinates @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the purely radius - dependent number density distribution along the polar axis , and @xmath105 is the equator - to - pole density contrast .",
    "the latitude dependence of the density is modeled as a sine function of the co - latitude @xmath106 to some power @xmath107 .",
    "this density function is motivated by examples of equatorial density enhancements inferred for some classes or particular stars , such as b[e ] stars , or wr  134 that will be discussed later . in the case of",

    "these density functions are not specifically related to any particular model , but are chosen as a convenient way of characterizing axisymmetric winds .    to characterize the degree of asymmetry in the wind , an opening angle @xmath111 refers to the latitude interval between either the pole or equator and the latitude at which @xmath112 .",
    "this works out in value to be the same for both polar or equatorially enhanced winds , as given by    @xmath113    values of @xmath111 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] against the logarithm of the power exponent @xmath107 . within this parametrization ,",
    "well - confined polar or equatorial flows require quite large values of @xmath107 .",
    "for example , in order to achieve @xmath114 , a value of @xmath115 is required .    with forbidden line emission formed over a large - scale volume , we shall ignore the inner wind acceleration based on the arguments of the previous section , and treat all densities to vary as @xmath11 . to compare the spherical outflow case with the axisymmetric models , the following normalization is used :    @xmath116    where @xmath117 .",
    "for a given value of @xmath118 and @xmath107 , this equation determines the ratio @xmath119 for a dense equatorial wind or @xmath120 for a dense polar wind .    to illustrate , example density profiles",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for different values of @xmath118 and @xmath107 .",
    "the density is normalized to the spherical equivalent , namely a spherical wind with the same mass - flux as the axisymmetric one .",
    "the density is plotted as a function of stellar co - latitude in @xmath121 , and so the equator is at left , and the pole at right .",
    "the solid curves are for the polar enhanced winds , and the dashed for denser equatorial winds . a brief comment on the dense polar winds versus the dense equatorial winds .",
    "when @xmath107 and @xmath118 are constant , @xmath122 will be larger for a dense polar wind than the corresponding value of @xmath123 for a dense equatorial wind . although the opening angle @xmath111 will be the same , the solid angle associated with the respective dense components is not equal , being smaller in the case of a polar flow .      for the ionization balance in the wind , steady - state conditions are assumed . only radiative recombination and photo - ionization",
    "are considered .",
    "the ion stage @xmath33 ranges from 0 to @xmath124 , where ` 0 ' denotes a neutral atom , and ` @xmath124 ' complete ionization .",
    "since interest is focussed on forbidden lines of trace metals , the electron number density is assumed _ not _ to be impacted by the ionization balance of the metals .",
    "for example in o stars , hydrogen can be safely considered as completely ionized with @xmath125 for all radii and latitudes . for a wr  wind , singly or doubly ionized helium would dominate the electron number density ( although ionization of c and o is relevant for the carbon - rich wr stars ) .",
    "mainly modest distortions of the wind from spherical are considered , and not dense equatorial discs or polar jets .",
    "the simplification is that with @xmath9 given , the ionization balance for different metal species is independent .    under these conditions ,",
    "ionization equilibrium will be governed by equations of the form    @xmath126    where the ion stages are all for the same element so that the subscript ` e ' has been dropped , @xmath127 is a recombination coefficient for ion @xmath33 , @xmath7 is a mean intensity , @xmath128 is the photo - ionization edge frequency for ion @xmath33 , and @xmath129 is the photo - ionization cross - section for ion @xmath33 . in general ,",
    "the equation directly couples three adjacent ion stages ; implicitly all of the stages are coupled through the fact that @xmath130 . to complete the set of equations",
    ", one has that for the equation involving @xmath131 , there is no recombination to a lower ion stage , and for the case @xmath132 , there is no photo - ionization to a higher ion stage .",
    "these expressions can be simplified considerably , by assuming the diffuse radiation is negligible .",
    "the application of the theory in this paper emphasizes wr  winds , and it is well - known these winds are so dense that the continuum forms in the wind itself , and a classic static photosphere is not observed . as such , the stellar radius is ill - defined , being wavelength dependent .",
    "still we adopt a core - halo approach , in which the continuous opacity is thin beyond the radius where the continuum forms , because this is a good approximation for ascertaining the ionization balance at large radii where the forbidden line emission is generated .    to determine the ionization balance from a set of expressions based on equation  ( [ eq : ioniz ] ) , it is useful to define the following dimensionless parameter :    @xmath133    where    @xmath134   \\\\       { h_{\\rm eq}^{-1 } \\ , [ 1+(g-1)\\sin^m \\theta _ * ] }       \\end{array }       \\right.\\ ] ]    for the appropriate dense polar or dense equatorial wind case . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce @xmath135 .",
    "the factor @xmath136 pertains to the photo - ionization rate , as given by    @xmath137    where the factor of @xmath138 comes from the dilution factor in the large radius limit .",
    "it is also seen that the latitude dependence for a wind with an axisymmetric density distribution enters into the ionization balance via the recombination rate terms .",
    "the ion fraction @xmath139 will be given by    @xmath140    this form also holds for the saha equation , such as found in mihalas ( 1978 , eq .  5.17 ) .",
    "however , we stress again that equation  ( [ eq : q ] ) for the solution of the ionization balance specifically refers to trace metals in which the electron number density is not substantially altered by the ionization balance in the element e under consideration .",
    "it is useful to consider some special cases in relation to the structure of expression  ( [ eq : q ] ) . consider the condition in which there is one dominant ion stage @xmath141 , with @xmath142 .",
    "the normalizations are such that as the stellar intensity is made either larger in amount or harder in energy , for a given base density @xmath143 , the values of @xmath144 will increase . as the dominant ion moves to higher stages , the lower ion stage fractions will become less significant .",
    "consider the expression for the dominant stage , as given by    @xmath145    stages with @xmath146 are not dominant , which can only mean that the photo - ionization rate is not large compared to the recombination rate , and so @xmath147 for @xmath146 . since the other factors are large compared to unity ( by definition , otherwise the stage @xmath141 could not be dominant if lower stages were not trace ) , then in the denominator , the normalization must be dominated by the term that involves the product @xmath148 , and so clearly @xmath149 since the numerator and denominator have like factors",
    ".    how then will adjacent stages scale with the density ? for the next lower stage and using the above argument for the dominant term in the denominator , the ion fraction will be    @xmath150    similarly , the next higher stage will scale as    @xmath151^{-1}.\\ ] ]    thus we arrive at the general rule , in the case where there is clearly a single dominant ion stage , that    @xmath152^{i_0-i}.      \\label{eq : scale}\\ ] ]    this is not an especially fresh revelation .",
    "for example , the result of equation  ( [ eq : scale ] ) with its dependence on @xmath153 for the case of spherical winds can be found in spirit in the discussion of lamers , cerruti - sola , & perinotto ( 1987 ) .",
    "( the scaling appears more clearly in bjorkman  1994 in their eq .  [",
    "17 ] . )",
    "a latitude - dependent ionization balance is important for the bi - stability effect ( pauldrach & puls 1990 ) for generating axisymmetric winds from the influence of stellar rotation ( lamers & pauldrach 1991 ) , although in this case it is a combination of a latitude - dependent stellar radiation field , mass - loss rate , and terminal speed that generates the axisymmetric wind density , whereas we are concerned with a ` generic ' latitude - dependent density and its feedback on the ionization balance in the wind .",
    "the radiative hydrodynamic models of petrenz & puls ( 2000 ) , who modeled axisymmetric line - driven winds from rotating stars , provide ion fractions with latitude ( their fig .",
    "16 ) . in their models",
    "the stellar radiation field is also latitude - dependent , and so impacts the ionization balance in addition to the varying wind density profile with latitude .",
    "those authors are interested mainly in the inner wind region , where recombination and resonance lines form , and they do not consider the formation of forbidden lines at large radius .",
    "although we could have allowed for a stellar radiation field that was latitude - dependent , we have chosen to take the stellar radiation field as isotropic and focus on the large - scale asymptotic properties of the wind .",
    "but it should be noted that the latitude - dependence of the stellar radiation field and the latitude - dependent mass flux will not be independent , and could act to enhance or suppress the effects presented here , the question of which trend being dependent on the physics of the mass - loss processes and associated radiation transport .      for computing a selection of model line profiles ,",
    "we have chosen to focus on forbidden lines for the element of neon that are of particular interest for wr  stars .",
    "the wr  winds are selected because they show a number of strong forbidden emission lines in their ir spectra as revealed by ground - based and satellite observations ( barlow  1988 ; willis 1997 ; morris  2000 ; dessart  2000 ; ignace  2001 ; morris , crowther , & houck 2004 ) , and these are important for determining metal abundances that can be used to test models of massive star evolution ( e.g. , meynet & maeder 2003 ) .",
    "neon is selected because lines from multiple stages of ionization of ne can be observed in the ir , such as [ neii ] and [ neiii ] , and possibly [ nev ] .",
    "note that our models neglect clumping , which warrants a comment or two .",
    "although clumping is well - known to affect diagnostics of wr  winds , such as recombination lines ( hillier 1991 ) and radio emission ( abbott 1981 ; nugis , crowther , & willis 1998 ) , and there is a growing body of evidence that clumping also influences the less dense o star winds ( crowther  2002 ; bouret , lanz , & hillier 2005 ; fullerton , massa , & prinja 2006 ) , a good theoretical understanding of wind clumping is lacking , because the numerical calculations are rather complex ( although there have been advances on this topic by dessart & owocki 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "the details of how clumping initiates , where it initiates , how it evolves in the wind , and how it might vary in response to a latitudinal density distribution ( not to mention the ionization balance ) remain more or less open questions . for spherical winds",
    "a constant clumping factor is straightforward to include , such as in dessart  ( 2000 ) or smith & houck ( 2005 ) .",
    "assuming clumping did not vary with radius or latitude , it could be included in our expressions as a simple multiplicative correction factor , but we have chosen to ignore clumping in our models for now , because of the many questions currently surrounding the details of clumping .",

    "there are several interesting comments and conclusions to be made from the parameter study :    1 .",
    "the profile distortions from a flat - top shape for the dense polar wind models as compared to dense equatorial winds appear more severe for a given value of @xmath118 and @xmath107 ; however , one must interpret this with caution .",
    "although at fixed @xmath107 , both models have the same opening angle @xmath111 , this does not translate to the same solid angle .",
    "for example , if @xmath187 for a polar wind model , then @xmath188 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : angle ] ] ) .",
    "the relative solid angle of the dense polar wind component is @xmath189 . for a model with a dense equatorial wind ,",
    "a structure of the same solid angle using the density parametrization of equation  ( [ eq : neq ] ) would have @xmath190 requiring @xmath191 .",
    "so for example to make a fair comparison of profiles between figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] as @xmath107 is varied , it is the short dashed line of [ fig5](e ) that should be contrasted with the solid line of [ fig6](e ) . in so doing , one finds that indeed the profile shapes are different between models of dense equatorial and dense polar winds , but the distortions from flat - top are comparable in amplitude .",
    "2 .   panels ( a ) and ( b ) for both figures shows that quite strong centrally peaked or double - horned profiles do result for the dominant ion ( dotted line type in these panels ) for favorable viewing perspectives of pole - on or equator - on . on the other hand , mid - latitude views as shown in panels ( d ) and",
    "( e ) for @xmath186 , statistically a probable viewing angle , reveal that distortions from flat - top shape are pretty mild , usually less than 20% deviations for the range of values in @xmath118 and @xmath107 shown .",
    "this is a result of the isovelocity zones , cones in this case , cutting across a fairly broad range of stellar latitudes and so sampling both high and low density regions .",
    "the end result is compensation such that the profile tends toward flat - top , unless the values of @xmath118 or @xmath107 become somewhat large .",
    "the profiles have been plotted in normalized form to emphasis the impact of model parameters on line shape .",
    "however , both @xmath118 and @xmath107 also impact the total line flux .",
    "if the emissivity were just linear in density , then the total line emission would be conserved even though the profile shape were to deviate from flat - top .",
    "the emissivity is only linear in density for the flat part ; it is quadratic in the linear segment of the contribution function ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . as a result",
    ", line flux is not conserved .",
    "indeed , it may be greater or smaller ( depending on the ion stage ) than an equivalent spherical wind of the same total mass - loss . for the dominant ion , line flux will be increased because of deviations from spherical flow . in general",
    "this biases ratios of line fluxes for deriving relative abundances . specifically ,",
    "if a line ratio is formed from two ions of different species but with the same value of @xmath192 ( and @xmath192 is constant with latitude for both ions ) , the effect cancels , and ion fraction ratios will be the same as if the wind were spherically symmetric .",
    "so valid abundance ratios can be derived even if the wind is axisymmetric , a consequence of the line being optically thin and stellar occultation effects negligible .",
    "however , this is only true if @xmath192 is the same for both lines , otherwise the ion fraction ratio will deviate from what would have been obtained from an equivalent spherical wind .",
    "the model results clearly show to what extent line profiles will deviate from flat - top as model parameters are varied , but what can be concluded about the wind structure given an observed line profile ? without some _ a priori _ knowledge , there are qualitative degeneracies which combined with limited signal - to - noise data can make the inverse problem challenging .",
    "for example , changing ion stage ( @xmath192 ) has effects that are similar to changing @xmath118 and/or @xmath107 , even toward making it ambiguous as to whether the wind is denser at the poles or the equator .",
    "normally , based on the spectral properties , one does have an idea about the dominant ion stage .",
    "+ if the ion state is roughly known , then increasing @xmath118 and @xmath107 tends to make the profiles display stronger deviations from a flat - top shape .",
    "both the total line flux and the amplitude of the features ( central peak or double - horns ) must be matched simultaneously as @xmath118 and @xmath107 vary .",
    "the width of these features must also be matched , which may discriminate between dense polar versus dense equatorial models .",
    "the viewing inclination also influences the sharpness of the features as well as their location within the profile .",
    "additional data , such as nebular morphology , polarimetry , or possibly even rotational @xmath193 values , may help to limit the range of viewing inclination .",
    "in practice , if the viewing inclination is intermediate of pole - on and edge - on ( as it likely will be ) , and the wind distortion is relatively mild , it may be hard or impossible to confidently determine the wind distortion parameters unless both the signal - to - noise and spectral resolution are quite high .",
    "the objective of this study has been to consider how forbidden emission line profiles might be used as a diagnostic of the large - scale structure of stellar winds that deviate from spherically symmetric outflow . to this end",
    ", we have introduced parametric expressions for dense polar or dense equatorial axisymmetric winds . the stellar radiation field and the wind terminal speed",
    "have both been treated as isotropic , but these are assumptions that should be relaxed in producing synthetic line profiles for a particular model wind . if the mass - loss from the star varies with latitude , it is to be expected that the terminal speed will also vary , possibly correlating or anti - correlating with the mass - loss rate depending on the specifics of the wind - driving physics . in combination with the effects of the ionization balance ,",
    "deviations of the line profile shape from flat - top may be suppressed or enhanced compared to the results presented here .",
    "relevant are the effects of clumping and velocity dispersions , such as those investigated by runacres & owocki ( 2002 ) for an o star model at large radius in the flow ( 100 s of stellar radii ) .",
    "exactly how such properties will vary will global asymmetries is unclear .",
    "however , for a spherical wind , if such effects persist over the scale @xmath72 , they should be detectable in the form of sloping , in contrast to more nearly vertical , high velocity wings to the forbidden line profile shape . for aspherical winds ,",
    "the expressions in this paper for thin forbidden lines can be modified to allow for a range of flow speeds and densities in a `` cell - by - cell '' approach to doing the numerical volume integration for the emission profile .    a particular focus of",
    "this work has been to highlight the coupling between density and ion stage which are coupled in latitude .",
    "these can act through the line emissivity to exacerbate or depress deviations of the line profile shape from a flat - top . including the effects of a latitude - dependent radiation field and terminal speed may modify the conclusions that we have drawn from our assumed model , but the overall principle that resolved forbidden emission lines can be excellent tracers of deviations from spherical flow remains robust . at the same time ,",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] do indicate that for winds with modest distortions from spherical as viewed somewhat more equator - on ( the case @xmath186 ) than pole - on ( @xmath185 ) , the line profiles of the dominant stage show modest deviations from a flat - top .",
    "combined with instrumental smearing and finite signal - to - noise , such profiles might pass as essentially flat - top .",
    "as an observational strategy , it would be best to obtain forbidden emission line data for different ion stages within the same atom .",
    "this is not too common however , as ion stages subordinate to the dominant one can have much smaller ion fraction values and produce only weak lines .",
    "the lines of [ neii ] 12.86 @xmath2 m and [ neiii ] 15.56  @xmath2 m are an example of a pair of forbidden lines in adjacent ion stages that can both be seen in wr star winds ( see app .",

    "both lines were also seen in the luminous blue variable , p cygni ( lamers  1996 ) . already _ spitzer _ has observed a number of wr stars with the irs ; unfortunately , the irs generally has inadequate spectral resolution to analyze the line profile shapes to apply the results of this paper .",
    "an exception to this might be the extremely fast , but also extremely rare , winds of the oxygen - rich wo subtype ( ( barlow & hummer 1982 ; kingsburgh  1995 ) .",
    "these winds sport terminal speeds upwards of 3000 km / s ( e.g. , drew  2004 ) . forbidden lines observed at high resolution with the irs for the wo stars may be suitable to determine or place limits ( subject to the signal - to - noise ) on the geometry of the asymptotic structure of these winds .",

    "in contrast , the profiles at @xmath213 and @xmath210 show a slight double - horned structure in the first case and a centrally bubbled one in the second . both of these appear nearly flat - topped owing to the weak dependence on @xmath212 at @xmath214 and @xmath215 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the profiles for the dense equatorial flows ( lower panel ) are all centrally peaked , except for one that shows a modest double - horned morphology . here",
    "the denser flow is mostly in the plane of the sky corresponding to observed velocity shifts around line center .",
    "for the dominant ion stage and lower , this leads to modest or strong central peaks relative to a flat - topped profile and substantially depressed emission wings .",
    "interestingly , the depressed wings could make the determination of the true line width problematic owing to uncertainties in the continuum placement for modest signal - to - noise data . once again , as seen in the upper panel , the profiles for 1 and 2 stages above the dominant ion approach a somewhat more flat - top appearance , and switches from centrally peaked emission for @xmath213 to the double - horned appearance for @xmath216 .",
    "the derivations of this paper are predicated on the assumption of a two - level atom . a forbidden line of considerable interest from wr  stars is the [ neiii ] 15.55 @xmath2 m line ( @xmath217p@xmath218 - @xmath217p@xmath219 ) , which is seen to be strong in a number of wr stars from observations by _ iso _ ( morris  2000 ; dessart  2000 ) and _ spitzer _ ( morris  2004 ; cassinelli , private comm . ) . however , neiii has five low - lying energy levels , that are ( in order of increasing energy ) : @xmath217p@xmath219 , @xmath217p@xmath218 , @xmath217p@xmath220 , @xmath221d@xmath220 , and @xmath221s@xmath219 .",
    "the question is then , how bad is the two - level approximation for neiii ?",

    "<S> a number of strong infrared forbidden lines have been observed in several evolved wolf - rayet star winds , and these are important for deriving metal abundances and testing stellar evolution models . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , because these optically thin lines form at large radius in the wind , their resolved profiles carry an imprint of the asymptotic structure of the wind flow . </S>",
    "<S> this work presents model forbidden line profile shapes formed in axisymmetric winds . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that an optically thin emission line formed in a spherical wind expanding at constant velocity yields a flat - topped emission profile shape . </S>",
    "<S> simulated forbidden lines are produced for a model stellar wind with an axisymmetric density distribution that treats the latitudinal ionization self - consistently and examines the influence of the ion stage on the profile shape . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting line profiles are symmetric about line centre . within a given atomic species </S>",
    "<S> , profile shapes can vary between centrally peaked , doubly peaked , and approximately flat - topped in appearance depending on the ion stage ( relative to the dominant ion ) and viewing inclination . </S>",
    "<S> although application to wolf - rayet star winds is emphasized , the concepts are also relevant to other classes of hot stars such as luminous blue variables and be / b[e ] stars .    </S>",
