    "cluster luminosity functions ( clfs ) and colour distributions are the most important diagnostics in the study of globular and compact star cluster populations in nearby galaxies . for the old globular cluster ( gc ) systems in ,",
    "e.g. , the galaxy , m31 , m87 , and old elliptical galaxies , the clf shape is well - established : it is roughly gaussian , with the peak or turnover magnitude at @xmath6 mag and a gaussian fwhm of @xmath7 mag ( whitmore et al . 1995 ,",

    "the well - studied young star cluster ( ysc ) population in the lmc and the galactic open cluster system , on the other hand , display a power - law clf ( elson & fall 1985 , harris & pudritz 1994 , elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .    _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations are continuing to provide an ever increasing number of clfs for compact ysc systems in galaxies beyond the local group and the virgo cluster ( e.g. , whitmore & schweizer 1995 , schweizer et al .",
    "1996 , miller et al .",
    "1997 , zepf et al .",
    "1999 , de grijs , oconnell & gallagher 2001 , whitmore et al .",
    "although a large number of studies have attempted to detect a turn - over in young or intermediate - age clfs , the shapes of such young and intermediate - age clfs have thus far been consistent with power laws down to the observational completeness thresholds ( but see miller et al .",
    "1997 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a , b ) .",
    "the striking difference between the power - law distributions for young star clusters and the gaussian distribution of the old galactic gcs has recently attracted renewed theoretical attention .",
    "the currently most popular ( but , admittedly , speculative ) gc formation models suggest that the distribution of the initial cluster masses is closely approximated by a power law ( e.g. , harris & pudritz 1994 , mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 , elmegreen & efremov 1997 , gnedin & ostriker 1997 , fall & zhang 2001 )",
    ".    which processes will affect the clfs such that they transform from a power - law shape to a gaussian distribution ?",
    "it is generally assumed that the processes responsible for the depletion of a star cluster population over time - scales of a hubble time include the preferential depletion of low - mass clusters both by evaporation due to two - body relaxation and by tidal interactions with the gravitational field of their host galaxy ( e.g. , fall & rees 1977 , 1985 , elmegreen & efremov 1997 , murali & weinberg 1997a , b , c , ostriker & gnedin 1997 , harris et al .",
    "1998 , fall & zhang 2001 ) , and the preferential disruption of high - mass clusters by dynamical friction ( vesperini 2000 , 2001 ) . from the currently most popular gc evolution models it follows that _ any _ initial mass ( or luminosity ) distribution will shortly be transformed into a peaked distribution ,",
    "although it should be noted that these models apply only to milky way - type conditions in which the gc system is characterised by significant radially dependent radial anisotropy .",
    "vesperini ( 2000 , 2001 ) has included the internal gravitational interactions between cluster stars in his models and concludes that these need considerable fine tuning to transform a power law initial cluster mass function ( icmf ) into a gaussian distribution , whereas a gaussian icmf conserves its shape rather independently of the choice of parameters : destruction of low - mass clusters by evaporation and the tidal field is balanced by the destruction of high - mass clusters through dynamical friction .",
    "all of these models are valid _ only _ for milky way - type gravitational potentials , however .",
    "galaxy - galaxy interactions will obviously have a major effect on the resulting gravitational potential , in which the dynamical star cluster evolution is likely significantly different ( see , e.g. , boutloukos & lamers 2003 , de grijs et al",
    ". 2003a ) .",
    "the mass spectrum of molecular clouds or molecular cloud cores , progenitors of young star clusters , has never been determined in interacting galaxies to similarly faint limits as in the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
    "the significant external pressure in interacting gas - rich galaxies may be expected to have a major effect on the molecular cloud mass spectrum .",
    "significant age spread effects in young cluster systems  in which cluster formation is still ongoing  affect the observed clf ( meurer 1995 , fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 1998 , 1999 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a , b ) , which might in fact make an intrinsically gaussian clf ( or icmf ) appear as a power - law clf ( see , e.g. , miller et al . 1997 , fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 1998 ) .",
    "it is obviously very important to age date the individual clusters and to correct the observed clf to a common age , before interpreting the clf ( fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 1999 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a , b ) , in particular if the age spread within a cluster system is a significant fraction of the system s mean age .    in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) , we provide the first observational evidence for a clear turn - over in the intermediate - age clf of the clusters formed _ in the burst of cluster formation _ in m82 s fossil starburst region `` b '' , which very closely matches the universal clfs of old gc systems .",
    "this provides an important test of cluster disruption models ( see de grijs et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "metallicities of yscs produced in galaxy interactions , mergers or starbursts are an important discriminator against gcs formed in the early universe .",
    "they are expected to correspond to the interstellar medium ( ism ) abundances of the interacting / starburst galaxies , and are therefore most likely significantly higher than those of halo gcs in the milky way and other galaxies with old gc systems .",
    "ism abundances span a considerable range , however , among different galaxy types from sa through sd , irregular , and dwarf galaxies , and may exhibit significant radial gradients ( oey & kennicutt 1993 , zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 , richer & mccall 1995 ) .",
    "many of these galaxies show abundance gradients , which have recently been shown to sometimes extend considerably beyond their optical radii ( ferguson et al .",
    "1998 , van zee et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , from those large radii , gas can be funneled efficiently into the inner regions during galaxy interactions and mergers ( e.g. , hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "hence , a considerable metallicity range may be expected for yscs produced in interactions of various types of galaxies and even among the yscs formed within one global galaxy - wide starburst .    during a strong burst ,",
    "typically lasting a few @xmath8 yr in a massive gas - rich galaxy , a significant increase of the ism abundance may occur ( fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben & gerhardt 1994 , their fig .",
    "meanwhile , some fraction of the gas enriched by dying first - generation burst stars may well be shock - compressed to cool fast enough to be built into later generations of stars or clusters produced in the burst . the same effect",
    "may occur when multiple bursts occur in a series of close encounters between two galaxies before their final merger .",
    "hence , in extended starburst episodes metallicity differences between yscs formed early on and late in the burst phase may be expected .",
    "precise ( relative ) metallicity determinations for individual yscs are not only important to study the questions raised above , but also for the correct derivation of ages from broad - band colours .",
    "dust extinction is often very important in ysc systems .",
    "in particular the youngest post - burst galaxies and galaxies with ongoing starbursts often show strong and patchy dust structures and morphologies .",
    "for instance , the youngest clusters in the overlap region of the two galactic discs in the antennae galaxies are completely obscured in the optical and can only be detected in near or mid - infrared observations ( mirabel et al .",
    "1998 , mengel et al . 2001 ) .",
    "older merger remnants like ngc 7252 or ngc 3921 seem to have blown their inner regions clear of all the gas left over from intense star formation during the burst ( e.g. , schweizer et al .",
    "extinction estimates towards individual yscs are therefore as important as individual metallicity estimates in order to obtain reliable ages and to be able to derive an age - normalised clf or ysc mass function .",
    "individual ysc spectroscopy , feasible today with 8m - class telescopes for the nearest systems , is very time - consuming , since observations of large numbers of clusters are required to obtain statistically significant results .",
    "multi - passband imaging is a very interesting and useful alternative , as we will show below , in particular if it includes coverage of near - infrared ( nir ) and/or ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths .",
    "the large majority of extragalactic star cluster studies done to date have essentially used two or three - passband aperture photometry , combined with theoretical stellar population synthesis models to obtain age estimates .",
    "the accuracy to which this can be done obviously depends on the number of different ( broad - band ) filters available as well as , crucially , on the actual wavelengths and wavelength range covered by the observations , and on the psf size compared to the cluster surface density profile ( i.e. , on how close to the observations were taken to the confusion limit for these clusters ) .    in this paper",
    "we assess the systematic uncertainties in age , extinction and metallicity determinations for ysc systems inherent to the use of broad - band , integrated colours .",
    "we have developed an evolutionary synthesis optimisation technique that can be applied to photometric measurements in a given number @xmath9 of broad - band passbands .",
    "the optimisation routine then simultaneously determines the best combination of age , extinction and metallicity from a comparison with the most up - to - date gttingen simple stellar population ( ssp ) models ( schulz et al .",
    "2002 ) , to which we have added the contributions of an exhaustive set of gaseous emission lines and gaseous continuum emission ( anders , fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben & de grijs 2002 , anders & fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 2003 ) .",
    "we also compare these results with similar determinations based on the starburst99 ssp models ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , but assuming fixed , solar metallicity for our sample clusters .",
    "although this is an often - used assumption , we will show that this introduces significant systematic effects in the final age distribution , and therefore also in the mass distribution .",
    "we decided to focus our efforts on the nearby , well - studied starburst galaxy ngc 3310 , known to harbour large numbers of young star clusters , for which multi - passband observations from the near - uv to the nir are readily available from the _ hst _ data archive ( section [ obs.sect ] ; see also elmegreen et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter e02 ) . in section [ ngc3310.sect ]",
    "we first place the ngc 3310 starburst in its physical context .",
    "we then discuss the derived age distribution of the cluster population , which we extend compared to previous work , in terms of the evolution of the clf and the interaction stage of its parent galaxy in sections [ agedet.sec ] and [ interpretation.sec ] .",
    "we summarise our main results and conclusions in section [ summary.sect ] .",
    "finally , we will apply our knowledge of the systematic uncertainties gained in this paper to a larger sample of nearby starburst and interacting galaxies drawn from the _ hst _ go-8645 programme ( windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ) in papers ii and iii ( de grijs et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "ngc 3310 is a representative member of the class of galaxies often showing signs of active starbursts and recently formed star clusters .",
    "the galaxy may have been a normal , quiescent sbc - type galaxy before it started to produce large numbers of new stars , possibly due to the merger with a gas - rich low - metallicity companion ( cf .",
    "kobulnicky & skillman 1995 ) .",
    "as part of _ hst _ programme go-8645 , we obtained observations of ngc 3310 through the f300w ( `` uv '' ) and f814w filters ( windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ) , with the galaxy centre located on chip 3 of the wide field planetary camera 2 ( _ wfpc2 _ ) .",
    "observations in additional passbands were obtained from the _ hst _ data archive . in order to obtain the largest common field of view ( fov ) in the optical wavelength range , we restricted these archival data to be taken with the _",
    "wfpc2_. in addition , we obtained archival nir images taken with the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer s ( nicmos ) camera 2 , which provides the best compromise of spatial resolution ( 0075 pixel@xmath10 ) and fov ( 192@xmath11192 ) when combined with _",
    "wfpc2 _ observations ( see below ) .",
    "we have summarized the combined set of _ hst _ observations through broad - band filters used in this paper in table [ obs.tab ] .",
    ".[obs.tab]overview of the _ hst _ observations of ngc 3310 [ cols=\"^,>,^,^ , > \" , ]     a first comparison of our individually derived metallicity estimates shows that e02 s assumption of a mean cluster metallicity of @xmath12 ( based on spectroscopic metallicity determinations by p93 ) is reasonable , except for a few clusters with significantly supersolar abundances .",
    "secondly , our low extinction values are also in line with our expectations for the circumnuclear ring clusters ; although the extinction in the starburst ring varies in the range @xmath13 mag ( grotheus & schmidt - kaler 1991 ) , is has been shown that circumnuclear ring clusters are often either almost fully obscured or virtually dust free ( e.g. , maoz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimate the average extinction in the ngc 3310 starburst regions to be in the range @xmath14 , based on the slope of the uv sed and published balmer decrement measurements ( p93 ) , respectively , and p93 estimated @xmath15 based on spectroscopic measurements ( see also s96 , d00 ) .",
    "since these extinction estimates cover both the yscs and the ism , they are consistent with being upper limits to the extinction towards individual yscs .    for their large - scale complexes , e02 assumed a mean age of @xmath16 yr , which is somewhat underestimated compared to our mean age of the individual clusters in these complexes of @xmath17 yr .",
    "for the `` jumbo '' region ( e02 complex 108 + 109 ) , p93 derived an age of @xmath18 yr from spectrophotometry , which is consistent with the median age we derive for the clusters in this region , @xmath19 yr .",
    "although the match between our individual cluster age estimates and the e02 results is good for clusters 8 ( e02 estimate @xmath20 myr ; our estimate @xmath21 myr ) , 19 ( @xmath20 vs. @xmath22 myr ) and 64 ( @xmath23 vs. 33 myr ) , and reasonable for clusters 36 ( @xmath24 vs. @xmath25 myr ) and 90 ( @xmath23 vs. 14 myr ) , it is poor for clusters 37 ( @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 myr ; this is no surprise , because our models do not extend to such young ages ) , 49 ( @xmath23 vs. 94 myr ) , and 59 ( @xmath23 vs. 320 myr ) . owing to the strong age - dependence of the m / l ratio at those young ages , small differences in our age estimates _",
    "will _ have significant consequences for the final mass determinations , for ages in the range determined for the ngc 3310 clusters .",
    "in addition , the difference in the assumed distance modulus to ngc 3310 between ourselves ( @xmath28 mpc ; sect .",
    "[ sources.sect ] ) and e02 ( @xmath29 mpc ) of @xmath30 mag introduces an additional uncertainty to the clusters luminosity of @xmath31 , corresponding to a factor of @xmath32 in luminosity , and therefore in the mass ( via the m / l ratio ) as well , in the sense that we expect the e02 mass estimates to be @xmath33 higher .",
    "thus , from a comparison between our final masses and those of e02 , we conclude that the factor of @xmath34 between most of our mass estimates , in the sense that e02 s masses are the higher , is not too surprising in view of the many uncertainties involved in ( i ) the difference in distance to ngc 3310 assumed , ( ii ) the different methods used for our mass estimates , ( iii ) the different ways in which we obtained our aperture photometry and the subsequent photometric calibrations ( e02 converted their measurements to the standard ground - based system , while we continued in the stmag system ) , and ( iv ) the different models employed ( cf .",
    "fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 2000 ) . regarding the latter , we point out that these differences may have been augmented by our inclusion of nebular emission ( which we have shown to be important for ages younger than @xmath2 yr ; anders et al .",
    "2002 , anders & fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 2003 ) and our approach to solve for all of our free parameters simultaneously .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that while we can obtain robust relative distributions of masses , ages , and metallicities for a given star cluster system fairly easily ( as shown throughout this paper ) , the absolute calibration , and therefore the absolute mass , age and metallicity scales can only be fixed robustly if we have access to independent _ spectroscopic _ measurements of these parameters .",
    "the importance of correcting the observed clfs to a common age can not be overemphasized .",
    "age spread effects in young cluster systems , and therefore the combined effects of ongoing cluster formation , evolutionary fading , and the onset of cluster disruption , affect the observed clf ( cf .",
    "meurer 1995 , fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 1999 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a , b ) .",
    "this implies that the clf observed in such a system represents merely a temporal situation , rather than a characteristic property of a coeval cluster system .    using the age estimates obtained for the individual clusters",
    ", we corrected the f606w magnitudes of our cluster sample to a common age of @xmath35 yr using the anders & fritze  v .",

    "[ cffields.fig]a . in order to provide a comparison with the clfs of other young cluster systems",
    ", we employed the levenberg - marquardt method ( marquardt 1963 ) to fit power - law slopes of the form @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the luminosity of a cluster , and @xmath38 the power - law slope ) to both clfs .    in the _ v_-band luminosity range @xmath39 ( @xmath3 mag ) , the slope of the clf is @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for the full , uncorrected sample of clusters , and for the `` best - fit '' sample corrected to a common age of @xmath42 , respectively .    in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and parmentier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we showed that the constant - age _ v_-band clf for the bright clusters in m82 s post - starburst region `` b '' roughly follows a power law with a slope in the range @xmath43 , which is consistent with the power - law slopes of other young clfs , and within the uncertainties also with the ngc 3310 clf . on the other hand",
    ", d00 found a significantly shallower slope of @xmath44 for the h@xmath38-bright circumnuclear star forming regions in ngc 3310 ( but we note that these are likely the youngest objects populating the clf , with ages @xmath45 myr , depending on metallicity ) , while e02 obtained slopes as steep as @xmath46 from their _ b _ and _ k_-band cluster measurements , which is  within the uncertainties  consistent with our _ v_-band determination .",
    "the main uncertainties that are expected to affect the clf slope in this latter case are the luminosity range over which the slopes were obtained , and the fact that e02 did not correct their clfs to a common age before measuring their slopes .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the systematic uncertainties involved in using broad - band uv , optical and nir observations to derive age , mass , metallicity and extinction distributions for extragalactic star cluster systems .",
    "the large majority of extragalactic star cluster studies done to date have essentially used two or three - passband aperture photometry , combined with theoretical stellar population synthesis models to obtain age estimates . the accuracy",
    "to which this can be done obviously depends on the number of different ( broad - band ) filters available as well as , crucially , on the actual wavelengths and the wavelength range covered by the observations .",
    "understanding these systematic uncertainties is therefore of the utmost importance for a well - balanced interpretation of the properties of such star cluster systems .",
    "we focused our analysis on the nearby , well - studied starburst galaxy ngc 3310 , known to harbour large numbers of young star clusters , for which we obtained multi - passband observations from the uv to the nir from the _ hst _ data archive .",
    "we used our evolutionary synthesis optimisation technique to simultaneously determine the best combination of age , extinction and metallicity .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows . for a star cluster system as young as that in ngc 3310 ,    * the peak of the age distribution is robustly reproduced for all of our choices of passband combinations , except for the red - only selected filter combination ; * red - dominated passband combinations result in significantly different ( uncertain ) age solutions , due to the weak time dependence of the nir magnitudes and due to unavoidable ambiguities in the modelling of the thermally pulsing agb phase ; they produce a significant wing of older clusters . *",
    "blue - selected passband combinations tend to result in age estimates that are slightly skewed towards younger ages , compared to passband combinations that also include redder passbands .",
    "this is due to the combination of observational selection effects and to the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy , which is also of importance in passband combinations containing only optical filters .",
    "* for ages @xmath47 , we conclude that if one can only obtain partial coverage of a star cluster s sed , an optical passband combination of at least 4 filters including _ both _",
    "blue _ and _ red optical passbands results in the best balanced and most representative age distribution . while blue - selected passband combinations lead to age distributions that are slightly biased towards younger ages , red and in particular nir - dominated passband combinations should be avoided . *",
    "the physical effect most limiting the accuracy of our age determinations , for ages up to @xmath48 yr , is the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in our comparison with results obtained assuming a fixed , solar metallicity .",
    "if the actual cluster metallicities are significantly subsolar , this assumption results in a markedly different age distribution , biased towards younger ages , compared to the distribution obtained by leaving the metallicity as a free parameter .",
    "ngc 3310 is a local , very active starburst galaxy with high global star formation efficiency , which has experienced very recent star formation in star clusters and hii regions , in the last @xmath49 yr . in the inner fov covered by all of our passbands",
    ", we detected some 300 star cluster candidates , while an additional @xmath50 clusters were detected in the outer fov covered by the _",
    "filters only , all of them affected by only moderate levels of ngc 3310-internal extinction towards the clusters , e@xmath51 mag . the age distribution derived for these clusters indicates that ngc 3310 underwent a significant burst of cluster formation some @xmath52 yr ago .",
    "the actual duration of the burst of cluster formation , which we estimate to have lasted for almost 20 myr , may have been shorter because uncertainties in the age determinations may have broadened the peak .",
    "it appears , therefore , that the peak of cluster formation in ngc 3310 coincides closely with the suspected galactic cannibalism or last tidal interaction .",
    "the clusters older than @xmath16 yr are smoothly distributed throughout the galactic centre",
    ". however , the younger clusters , with ages @xmath53 , are predominantly concentrated in the jumbo region and in the northern spiral arm .",
    "this is consistent with the very young ages independently derived for these regions , @xmath54 myr , although both regions also contain clusters spanning the entire age range observed for the ngc 3310 star cluster system .",
    "the clf is the result of a complex interplay of the intrinsic cluster mass distribution , age spread and cluster disruption processes .",
    "we therefore determined the individual cluster masses by scaling our model seds for the best - fit age , extinction values and metallicity estimates to the observed seds .",
    "we estimate the cluster system to have a median mass of @xmath55 , not including systematic uncertainties introduced by the uncertainties in the low - mass imf slope .",
    "our metallicity determinations are strongly dominated by ( significantly ) subsolar metallicities , which is consistent with independent metallicity measurements .",
    "there is some evidence that the most actively star forming regions , in particular the jumbo region and the northern spiral arm , are predominantly composed of lower - abundance star clusters .",
    "the _ v_-band clf slope in the range @xmath39 for the ngc 3310 star cluster system is @xmath56 , which is consistent with the power - law slopes of other young clfs .",
    "finally , we point out that our estimates for the ages , masses , metallicities and extinction values of the yscs in ngc 3310 closely match previous , independent determinations of these parameters , where available ( e.g. , grotheus & schmidt - kaler 1991 , p93 , meurer et al . 1995 , d00 , e02 ) .",
