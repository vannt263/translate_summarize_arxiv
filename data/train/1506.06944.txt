    "density functional theory ( dft ) has greatly advanced over the past years and is nowadays able to predict parameters of spin - hamiltonians with which the low - temperature physics of correlated magnetic materials can be described , compare e.g. refs .  .",
    "along this line the complex spin - hamiltonian of one of the most exciting magnetic molecules , mn@xmath0-acetate , was recently predicted.@xcite these calculations consider almost all terms that are bilinear in spin operators as there are the heisenberg exchange interaction , the anisotropic antisymmetric exchange interaction and the single - ion anisotropy tensors .",
    "the new calculations outperform earlier attempts@xcite and provide much richer electronic insight than parameterizations obtained from fits to magnetic observables@xcite or parameterizations resting on knowledge from similar but smaller systems .",
    "but despite all the success dft is not capable of evaluating magnetic observables which is the reason for the detour via spin - hamiltonians .",
    "the magnetism of anisotropic molecular spin systems is fascinating due to interesting phenomena such as bistability and quantum tunneling of the magnetization.@xcite bistability in connection with a small tunneling rate leads to a magnetic hysteresis of molecular origin in these systems .",
    "that s why such molecules are termed single molecule magnets ( smm ) ; mn@xmath0-acetate is the most prominent smm . @xcite",
    "but although mn@xmath0-acetate  contains only four mn@xmath1 ions with @xmath2 and eight mn@xmath3 ions with @xmath4 , it constitutes a massive challenge for theoretical calculations in terms of spin - hamiltonians since the underlying hilbert space of dimension 100,000,000 is orders of magnitude too big for an exact and complete matrix diagonalization.@xcite but thanks to the fact that the zero - field split ground - state multiplet is energetically separated from higher - lying levels a description using only the @xmath5 ground - state manifold is sufficient to explain observables at low temperature  this approach was used in the past .",
    "thermodynamic functions which involve higher - lying levels , for instance observables at higher temperature , can of course not be evaluated in such an approximation .",
    "fortunately not only on the side of dft progress has been made in past years , but also in terms of powerful approximations for spin - hamiltonian calculations . for not too big systems with hilbert spaces with dimensions of up to @xmath6 krylov space methods such as the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) have proven to provide astonishingly accurate approximations of magnetic observables.@xcite while ftlm has been used for heisenberg spin systems mostly , very recently the method was advanced to anisotropic spin systems.@xcite    in this article we therefore employ the most recent ftlm in order to study thermodynamic functions of mn@xmath0-acetate  starting from parameterizations provided by dft or other methods .",
    "we evaluate the magnetization as well as the specific heat both as function of temperature and field and compare the various parameterizations of the spin - hamiltonian .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec-2 ]",
    "the employed hamiltonian as well as basics of the finite - temperature lanczos method are introduced .",
    "section  [ sec-3 ] , [ sec-4 ] and [ sec-5 ] discuss the effective magnetic moment , the magnetization and the specific heat , respectively . the article closes with summary and outlook .",
    "for mn@xmath0-acetate , which is a highly anisotropic spin system , the complete hamiltonian of the spin system is given by the exchange term , the single - ion anisotropy , and the zeeman term , i. e. @xmath7 @xmath8 is a @xmath9 matrix for each interacting pair of spins at sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 which contains the isotropic heisenberg exchange parameters together with the anisotropic symmetric and antisymmetric terms . in the sign convention of ( [ e-2 - 1 ] )",
    "a positive heisenberg exchange corresponds to an antiferromagnetic interaction and a negative one to a ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the single - ion anisotropy tensor at site @xmath10 , which in its eigensystem @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , can be decomposed as @xmath16 the terms @xmath17 could in general be @xmath9 matrices , too , but for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that the @xmath17 are numbers and moreover that @xmath18 for all ions .",
    "this assumption is justified for the mn@xmath1 and mn@xmath3 ions in mn@xmath0-acetate , since the @xmath19-factors of both ions are estimated to be very close to two.@xcite    the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) approximates the partition function in two ways:@xcite @xmath20 the sum over a complete set of vectors is replaced by a much smaller sum over @xmath21 random vectors @xmath22 .",
    "the exponential of the hamiltonian is then approximated by its spectral representation in a krylov space spanned by the @xmath23 lanczos vectors starting from the respective random vector @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath24 is the n - th eigenvector of @xmath25 in this krylov space .",
    "it turns out that a very good accuracy can already be achieved for parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 , especially in cases when the low - lying energy spectrum is dense.@xcite",
    "mn@xmath0-acetate  contains four mn@xmath1 ions with @xmath2 and eight mn@xmath3 ions with @xmath4 . following ref .   the ions and the exchange pathways are depicted in fig .",
    "[ tlmm - f-1 ] .",
    "mn@xmath1 ions ( 1 - 4 ) are shown as red circles , mn@xmath3 ions ( 5 - 12 ) as blue ones .",
    "an @xmath28 symmetry of the molecule is assumed.@xcite     ions ( 1 - 4 ) are shown as red circles , mn@xmath3 ions ( 5 - 12 ) as blue ones .",
    "an @xmath28 symmetry is assumed.,width=226 ]    since the discovery of the pronounced smm - properties of mn@xmath0-acetate  several groups developed parameterizations of the full spin - hamiltonian .",
    "these data sets , of which the most prominent ones are given in table  [ tab - j ] , contain parameterizations of heisenberg models and were put forward following various scientific reasonings .",
    "earlier attempts assigned values of exchange interactions in analogy to smaller compounds with similar chemical bridges between the manganese ions .",
    "later investigations combined for instance high - temperature series expansion with the evaluation of low - lying excitations seen in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments.@xcite a necessary condition that has to be met by all parameterizations , is that the ground state has a total spin of @xmath5 .",
    "the most recent dft parameterization is also compatible with ins experiments.@xcite    .intra - molecular isotropic exchange interaction parameters ( in mev ) as suggested by various authors , compare ref .  .",

    "since the heisenberg model is su(2 ) symmetric , a ftlm version employing total @xmath30 symmetry was used with @xmath31 and @xmath32 in this case.@xcite one realizes that the gross structure of the magnetic moment ( which is proportional to @xmath33 ) is achieved by all parameterizations especially at lower temperatures of @xmath34  k. a finer inspection shows that the maximum is at a too low temperature for all parameterizations , so that the experimental low - temperature data points are not met . for higher temperatures towards room temperature one",
    "notices that only one parameterization@xcite ( blue curve ) closely follows the experimental data towards the paramagnetic limit .",
    "this is not astonishing since this parameterization was fitted to the high - temperature tail using a high - temperature series expansion .",
    "we conjecture that the somewhat too large effective magnetic moment of the dft parameterizations , refs .",
    ", at room temperature are related to the fact , that these parameterizations contain ferromagnetic interactions whereas a fit to the high - temperature behavior , ref .  , leads only to antiferromagnetic interactions , compare table  [ tab - j ] .",

    "besides the heisenberg terms of table  [ tab - j ] this parameterization contains anisotropic dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions as well as full @xmath9 anisotropy tensors for each manganese ion .",
    "it turns out that the additional terms improve the low - temperature data , compare fig .",
    "[ tlmm - f - f ] .",
    "the maximum shifts towards the experimental position and the data points for smaller temperatures are much better approximated .",
    "none of the plain heisenberg models could achieve such an improvement so far . for temperatures above 60",
    "k the anisotropic terms are irrelevant .",
    "the low - temperature magnetization usually provides strong fingerprints of the underlying spin - hamiltonian for instance in the case of magnetization steps due to ground state level crossings . for mn@xmath0-acetate",
    "the magnetization shows even richer characteristics , since below the blocking temperature a magnetic hysteresis is observed.@xcite this exciting physical property turns out to constitute a problem , when comparing to the theoretical equilibrium magnetization . due to the long relaxation times , approximately 2800 hours at @xmath35",
    "k,@xcite the experimental values do not necessarily reflect equilibrium values . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical evaluation of non - equilibrium observables for a full spin model of mn@xmath0-acetate  is totally out of reach .",
    "-acetate  at @xmath35  k. color code of curves as above .",
    "the dashed curve is evaluated for two field values per 1 t field interval only.,width=264 ]    figure  [ tlmm - f - c ] provides two experimental data sets as well as various theoretical curves .",
    "the data set of glaser@xcite was taken on a powder sample whereas the data set of sessoli@xcite was taken on a single crystal with a field in direction of the tetragonal axis of the @xmath28 symmetric molecule .",
    "both data sets coincide up to @xmath36  t , then the magnetization along the tetragonal axis jumps whereas the powder signal smoothly increases with field . already at this point it becomes clear that the measurements can not reflect equilibrium properties , because the magnetization along the tetragonal axis , which is the easy axis of this strongly anisotropic molecule,@xcite can not be the same as the powder averaged magnetization .",
    "interestingly , all theory curves that rest on heisenberg model calculations agree with each other perfectly , which is due to the fact that all produce a @xmath5 ground state that is largely separated from excited levels",
    ". they also agree with the experimental magnetization up to a field of @xmath37  t. between 1  t and 2.7  t the experimental data points stay below the theoretical curves . above @xmath38  t theory and magnetization along the tetragonal axis meet again . the calculation for the full spin model of mn@xmath0-acetate  as given in ref .",
    "yields a rather unexpected result : the powder - averaged magnetization stays well below all other theory curves ( expected since anisotropic ) , but stays also well below both experimental curves ( unexpected at least compared to the experimental powder data ) .",
    "-acetate  at @xmath35  k. the dashed curves are evaluated for two field values per 1 t field interval only .",
    "direction @xmath39 , direction @xmath40.,width=264 ]    in the following we compare our results with the measurements of ref .",
    "along two different directions , along the tetragonal axis and perpendicular to that , i.e. somewhere in the @xmath41-plane .",
    "figure  [ tlmm - f - i ] presents three theory curves : one for the powder average and two along special directions .",
    "direction @xmath39 points roughly along the tetragonal axis ( inclination of about @xmath42 ) and direction @xmath40 lays in the @xmath41-plane . both theoretical curves show systematically larger magnetization values than the experiment .",
    "this could be for two reasons : either the experimental curves are not in equilibrium , which is possible at @xmath35  k where the relaxation time of mn@xmath0-acetate  is long or the parameterization of ref .",
    "is still not yet optimal , i.e. the @xmath43 tensors could be too weak , for instance .",
    "nevertheless , the positive message is , that we can now calculate such curves and compare with experimental data .",
    "the theoretical costs , by the way , are still enormous . for the investigations shown in this article about 2  mio .",
    "cpu hours on a supercomputer had to be used , since the ftlm procedure has to be completed twice for every field value and direction .",
    "therefore , only a few field values have been used for the theoretical magnetization curves .",
    "-acetate  at @xmath35  k.,width=264 ]    finally we would like to present the high - field magnetization curves . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ tlmm - f - h ] the various parameterizations lead to distinctive differences at high fields . the high - field magnetization could be and has been measured in megagauss experiments.@xcite interestingly , the magnetization data given in ref .",
    "show pronounced features , likely related to magnetization steps , between 180  t and 400  t which could be compatible with the parameterization of ref .",
    "( blue curve in fig .",
    "[ tlmm - f - h ] ) . as realized already by the authors , this parameterization produces a sequence of level crossings between the @xmath5 ground manifold and the fully polarized state exactly in this field range .",
    "another observable that was measured very early in the history of mn@xmath0-acetate  is the heat capacity.@xcite figure  [ tlmm - f - g ] shows the experimental data of ref .   for @xmath44 ( top ) and @xmath45  t ( bottom ) .",
    "one notices that the heat capacity is rather large and grows steadily with temperature .",
    "this is due to a massive contribution from lattice vibrations ( phonons ) which grows like @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , heat capacity data of magnetic molecules are usually overwhelmed by phonon contributions above @xmath47  k.    -acetate  at @xmath44 ( top ) and @xmath45  t ( bottom ) .",

    "[ tlmm - f - g ] for the heisenberg parameterizations at @xmath44 . at low temperatures the theoretical values are two or more orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental ones .",
    "but for the calculation using the full anisotropic hamiltonian@xcite one notices that the low - temperature values agree very nicely .",
    "we think that this is due to a more smeared - out density of states at low energies in the anisotropic model whereas for heisenberg systems these levels belong to highly degenerate multiplets which leads to a different , i.e. much smaller heat capacity .",
    "interestingly , a magnetic field of @xmath45  t has a similar effect .",
    "it smears out the density of states due to zeeman splitting . therefore even for the plain heisenberg models the low - temperature heat capacity increases , but still does not agree with the experimental data .",
    "for the anisotropic spin - hamiltonian@xcite the low - temperature heat capacity does not change much and still agrees nicely with the experimental data .",
    "we conjecture that although the energy levels are moved around by the magnetic field , the overall structure of the density of states remains very similar .",
    "summarizing , the specific heat is well reproduced by the anisotropic spin - hamiltonian of ref",
    ".   for low - temperatures around 1  k.",
    "35 years after its synthesis and 22 years after the first measurements@xcite of mn@xmath0-acetate  the finite - temperature lanczos method puts us in a position to evaluate thermodynamic functions of really large magnetic molecules .",
    "it thus complements dft calculations of such big systems in so far that one does no longer need to stop half way to an understanding of thermodynamic observables .",
    "the next major necessary step is now to develop tools for an evaluation of non - equilibrium properties of such big quantum spin systems .",
