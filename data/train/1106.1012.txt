    "the gamma - ray imaging , polarization and spectroscopy ( _ grips _ ) mission @xcite consists of a gamma - ray monitor ( grm ) , an x - ray monitor ( xrm ) and an infrared telescope ( irt ) :    - the irt is an ir telescope with a 1 meter mirror and it will be a copy of _ euclid _ @xcite ; in addition , in irt focal point there is set a grond @xcite like system with 7 detectors , with a @xmath0 field of view ;    - the xrm is re - using _ erosita _ @xcite technology ; it will work in the energy range 0.1 - 10 kev with a spatial resolution of @xmath1 ;    - the grm will work in the energy range 200 kev - 80 mev with a spatial resolution of @xmath2 and it will also provide polarization ( @xmath3% ) .    these 3 instruments will be set in orbit onboard 2 different satellite buses , however , respecting the _ soyuz _ weight limits ( the total weight of grips is 5 tons , while the soyuz - fregat payload limit is 5.2 tons ) , it will require one single _",
    "soyuz _ launcher .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a schematic representation of the bus carrying grm ( while irt and xrt will fly onboard the second satellite bus ) , zooming into grm working principle .",
    "grm is a combined compton and pair conversion telescope , consisting of 3 different parts :    - a tracker ( tkr ) , made of silicon double - side detectors ( dsd ) , where the initial interaction takes place and the secondary charged particles are tracked ; the tkr consists of 4 towers , each tower consists of 64 layers spaced 5 mm from each other ( also a configuration with 3 mm spacing has been under investigation ) and each layer consists of @xmath4 dsd wafers of @xmath5 @xmath6 each .    - a calorimeter ( cal ) , made of labr@xmath7 , where the energy of the secondary particles is converted into light signal .    - an anti - coincidence shield ( acs ) , made of plastic scintillator ( ne110 ) , that will shield the instrument from charged particles ; note that the efficient background rejection , provided by the acs , is a crucial point for a mev telescope .",
    "a detailed description of grips mission can be found in @xcite and in the original project @xcite .",
    "looking from a gev and tev gamma - rays perspective , we list several scientific topics that show remarkable connections , putting emphasis on the _ origin of the cosmic rays_.      with the advent of _ fermi lat _ thousands of sources have been detected in the gev gamma - ray band ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and at kev energies thousands of sources were already known : instead in the mev band only @xmath8 40 sources are known @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows grm - grips sensitivity for @xmath9s observation time ; it shows that at 1 mev grm - grips is 40 times more sensitive than _ comptel / integral _ and this implies the detection of more than 1000 sources in a 1 year survey ! fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] underlines how the mev band is a poorly studied region of the electromagnetic spectrum , how grm - grips is complementary with gamma - ray and with soft x - ray experiments and how grm - grips will be able to bridge the gap between these two bands .      with the advent of _ swift _ , _ fermi _ gbm and _",
    "fermi _ lat , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) science is living a golden age .",
    "_ grips _ will operate in survey - mode and , thanks to its great field of view ( @xmath10 ) , will be a great grb monitor ( with more than 600 grbs expected per year ) .      finally , in case we would find density columns of @xmath12 @xmath13 and higher ( structure formations at @xmath14 )",
    "we could study resonance photon absorptions , such as the pigmy dipole resonance ( pdr ; produced by the resonance capture of photons on nuclear levels with energy of 3 - 9 mev ) and the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ; process that is naively described as oscillation of the neutron fluid relative to protons , at 15 - 25 mev ) , while the delta - resonance ( at @xmath8 325 mev ) is out of range ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "the thermal components finish at maximum at some hundreds of kev ; and the transition from thermal to non - thermal is crucial for many astrophysical high energy sources / processes , both extragalactic ( like in agns , jet - disk symbiosis ) or galactic ( like x - ray binaries , xrbs ) .    in particular in the case of galactic bh - disk systems , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we see that the temperature can increase to hundreds of kev ; we see as well the non - thermal component from very high energy ( @xmath15 ev ) observations , but a huge gap ( partially bridged by _ fermi _ and _ agile _ ) in between .",
    "grips will in fact be a great instrument for studying the history of our galaxy .",
    "there are in fact two unique lines produced after supernovae ( sn ) explosions that are visible in its energy range : @xmath16al ( half - life of 700000 years ) and @xmath17ti ( half - life of 60 yrs ) , both detected by comptel ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , that will allow us to map and to study the history of our galaxy with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the recent experience with _ fermi _ lat @xcite @xcite showed how difficult it is to study the galactic center ( gc ) region ; in particular , in @xcite a bump is visible in the energy spectrum at gev energies that is difficult to evaluate and is compatible with both a population of pulsars and a dark matter ( dm ) distribution .    also on this intricate topic",
    ", the synergy gev - mev can play a crucial role : in fact , the rest mass of the electron , 511 kev , is in the energy range of grips .",
    "it allows us to map the positron annihilation from regions such as the gc , or , more in general , from the galactic bulge .",
    "this will be crucial in order to evaluate the dm component in those regions , that , as seen by lat ( see @xcite for more details ) , are not easy to study at all . moreover having the @xmath19bump at 68 mev will be useful as well in order to be able to map also the hadronic component in those regions ( in order to accomplish this task will be useful to increase the energy range upper limit for grm and this is not difficult to implement in the current configuration of the instrument ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite point out that we can explain only @xmath816% of extragalactic mev - gev background and consequently need for a numerous faint population of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xmath20 10 mev in order to be able to explain the observed isotropic extragalactic gamma - ray diffuse emission .",
    "one of the most important achievement of grips will regard cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "crs are @xmath898% hadrons and @xmath82% leptons , they were discovered @xmath81 century ago by domenico pacini @xcite and victor hess @xcite and their origin is still unknown . while the leptons acceleration has been proven ( e.g. by x - rays and radio observations of snrs or pwne ) , the  smoking gun  for the hadronic acceleration is still missing . since the sixties",
    ", the sn explosions are thought to be responsible for the hadronic component of crs @xcite and the recent discoveries at tev ( from imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescpes , iacts ) and gev ( _ fermi _ lat ) energies seem to support this , however there is no conclusive proof yet .",
    "leptonic and hadronic processes have different signatures in the grm energy range .",
    "_ grips _ will be able to detect the sources that are thought to be responsible of crs acceleration and to precisely measure their spectra .    fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the spectra of the crab nebula and cassiopeia a extracted from the preliminary simulation of 1 minute of _ grips _ observations ; let us note once more that it would be extremely nice to have for the first time both the 511 kev and the 68 mev @xmath19 bumps in the same instrument .      on the other hand , the ",
    "hadronic fingerprint  can arrive from the study of the de - excitation lines of heavier nuclei : let us take the exemplary case of the carbon line at 4.4 mev from cassiopeia a , considering the prediction from the hadronic fit ( @xmath21 ) from gev - tev data @xcite .",
    "let us take a proton power law @xmath22 with total energy @xmath23 from @xcite and note that this would correspond to @xmath82% of the snr kinetic energy ( less than what is expected in the ginzburg scenario @xcite @xcite ) .    according to @xcite , electrons with a similar slope",
    "produce the hard x - rays via synchrotron emission : the inverse compton emission is suppressed , owing to a strong magnetic field b @xmath20 0.5 mg ( for leptonic gev - tev fits , 0.1 mg is needed ) .",
    "considering now a line width of @xmath30 kev , we obtain the flux that we were searching for and let us note that such a flux is clearly detectable by grm - grips ; as further check we can also compare it with the upper limit provided by comptel of the flux in the range ( 3 - 10 ) mev for the continuum @xcite :            using the ramaty / koslovsky code , we computed also the nuclear de - excitation line spectrum for the specific case of cassiopeia a abundancies ( visible in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , noticing the good agreement with the calculation above .",
    "_ grips _ is proposed to be launched in 2020 and its advent will answer many of the open questions in high energy astrophysics ; we showed that the answers to such questions are hidden in the mev gamma - ray band and that deep multi - wavelength studies ( in particular together with higher energy instruments , such as _ fermi _ , _ gamma 400 _ and cta ) will be able to provide the seeked answers .",
    "the deep importance of closing the mev - gap can be underlined by w. atwood , one of the fathers of _ fermi _ : `` if 10 years ago i could do an experiment from hundreds of kev to hundreds of mev , i would have done it instead of glast '' .",
    "we have shown how crucial _ grips _ will be in answering the one - century old question of the origin of cosmic rays ."
