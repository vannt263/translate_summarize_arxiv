    "a series of measurements using neutrinos from different sources _",
    "viz_. solar @xcite , atmospheric , @xcite reactor @xcite , and accelerator @xcite , have established the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations represents today one of the main experimental evidences of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "results from these experiments led us to the current standard three - neutrino mixing paradigm , in which the three active neutrinos @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are superposition of three massive neutrinos @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 with masses @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . the experimental results given by solar neutrino oscillations correspond to @xmath18 7.5 @xmath19 10@xmath20 ev@xmath21 and atmospheric neutrino oscillations correspond to @xmath22  @xmath19 10@xmath23 ev@xmath21 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath261 , 2 , 3 . two mixing angles , which are important in the solar neutrino and atmospheric neutrino sectors , have been measured to be large ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) while the third mixing angle which connects the two sectors has been recently measured @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "while data from all of the above mentioned experiments fit nicely into the standard three generation picture , there are indications ( sometimes referred as anomalies ) from other neutrino experiments which provide a motivation to extend the three generation paradigm to include a fourth neutrino mixed with the three standard neutrinos .",
    "the first such indication comes from the lsnd experiment  @xcite , which showed an excess of electron anti - neutrino events above the expected background with a 3.8@xmath30 significance , giving a hint for @xmath31 oscillations .",
    "however , the @xmath32 required to explain the data through neutrino oscillations is @xmath33 1 ev@xmath34 , making it impossible to fit lsnd data along with the solar and atmospheric neutrino data within the three - generation framework .",
    "therefore , in order to explain the lsnd results in terms of neutrino oscillations one has to postulate the existence of a fourth ( or more ) neutrino state(s ) which is referred to as  3  @xmath0  n \" model , where ` 3 ' stands for active flavors neutrinos and ` n ' for sterile neutrino  @xcite . on the other hand , from the @xmath35 collider searches , it has been measured the number of light neutrinos coupled to be @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "hence , the additional light neutrino(s ) may not couple to the standard model particles through weak currents .",
    "they are therefore referred to as sterile neutrinos .",
    "attempts have been made at confirming or refuting the lsnd hint for sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "the karmen experiment has earlier looked for @xmath31 oscillations @xcite and no excess observed in their data sample , conflicting with the lsnd claim .",
    "however , due to background issues , karmen was unable to rule out the entire lsnd region .",
    "the miniboone experiment  @xcite was subsequently built to check the lsnd signal but with baseline @xmath37 and energy @xmath38 of the experiment changed so that the @xmath39 matched with that of the lsnd .",
    "the miniboone experiment looked for signatures of @xmath40 and @xmath41 oscillations . in the @xmath40 study , the miniboone found no evidence for an excess of @xmath9 candidate events above 475 mev ; however , a 3@xmath30 excess of electron like events was observed below 475 mev , which so far has not been be explained convincingly by any known physics . on the other hand , in their anti - neutrino run , the miniboone  @xcite did see an excess of @xmath42 indicating @xmath31 oscillations with @xmath43 @xmath44 0.1 to 1.0 ev@xmath21 range , consistent with the evidence for anti - neutrino oscillations from the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the long - standing lsnd results , recently anomalies have emerged in reactor antineutrino @xcite and gallium - based solar neutrino experiments the gallex and the sage @xcite .",
    "the reactor antineutrino flux calculations were revisited and resulted in a decrease in the ratio of observed to predicted event rate from 0.976  @xmath45  0.024 to 0.943  @xmath45  0.023 leading to deviation from unity at a 98.6  @xmath1 confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "this in turn meant that all the earlier reactor antineutrino experiments has seen a deficit compared to expectation .",
    "hence , @xmath46 ev@xmath34 driven active - sterile oscillations were put forth as an explanation . the solar neutrino experiments sage and gallex , during their calibration process with a @xmath47cr source of known strength , observed an event rate which was somewhat lower than expected .",
    "this again hinted towards oscillations on short distance scales , active - sterile neutrino oscillation with @xmath48 ev@xmath34 has been proposed as an explanation .",
    "we refer the reader to ( sage )  @xcite for a recent status review of these anomalies ( other references including ( reactor and gallium ) @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological measurements can also provide information on the existence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "the sterile neutrinos having non - zero mass could impact the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum and modify large scale structure formation .",
    "the existence of sterile neutrinos which have been thermalized in the early universe may contribute to the number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( effective number of neutrino species ) .",
    "the combined analysis of data from cmb  @xmath0  lensing  @xmath0  bao(baryon acoustic oscillation ) experiments  @xcite provides a robust frequentist upper limit @xmath49 @xmath50 0.26 ev with 95  @xmath1 c.l .",
    "this paper presents the results of an investigation where the muon neutrino flux is used to constrain a possible mixing of a single sterile neutrino with the 3 known neutrinos , @xmath51 the ( 3  @xmath0  1 ) model . for simplicity ,",
    "we have considered only the case of  normal \" mass hierarchy both for the active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "in particular , the study quantifies the sensitivity of upcoming atmospheric neutrino based magnetized iron calorimeter detector ( ical ) at the india based neutrino observatory ( ino ) in constraining the active - sterile mixing parameters .",
    "the presence of sterile neutrinos with @xmath48 ev@xmath34 leads to fast oscillations causing the suppression of the down - going atmospheric neutrinos , otherwise absent in the standard three - generation paradigm . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors studied the constraints on the active - sterile mixing expected from atmospheric neutrinos in liquid argon detectors and magnetized iron calorimeters .",
    "they carried out their analysis in terms of neutrino energy and zenith angle , assuming fixed values of detector resolutions and efficiencies .",
    "in this work , a similar but a more extensive study is carried out .",
    "the nuance  @xcite event generator with the ical detector geometry has been used to simulate the event spectrum at ical .",
    "these are then folded with the detector resolution functions and efficiencies obtained by the ino collaboration using the geant4 based detector simulation framework developed for ical  @xcite . here",
    ", we carried out the analysis in three different ways .",
    "first , we binned the data in muon energy and muon zenith angle .",
    "next we took into account the hadron energy information along with the muon energy and muon zenith angle .",
    "we also compared the results from these two set of analyses .",
    "finally , we considered the neutrino events coming from all zenith angles in contrast to only down - going neutrino events as used in ref .",
    "@xcite and took the earth matter effects into account as well .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the ical detector and its physics goals .",
    "the sterile neutrino oscillation formalism including the earth matter effect is introduced in section iii .",
    "the incorporation of detector resolutions using the monte carlo method on neutrino induced raw events is given in section iv .",
    "the procedure adopted for estimating the oscillated events and the binning scheme considered for estimating the @xmath52 using muon energy , its zenith angle and hadron energy are briefly explained in the same section .",
    "the definition of @xmath52 with pull is given in sec.v .",
    "the sensitivity to sterile neutrino mixing at an exposure of 1 mt - yr is discussed in sec.vi .",
    "the detailed results are summarized in sec.vii .",
    "the 51 kton magnetized ical detector , which will use iron as a target , will be placed in an underground cavern , with a minimum all round rock cover of 1 km , in order to reduce the cosmic ray background .",
    "the shape and dimensions of the ical detector have been decided keeping in mind the cavern dimensions of 132 m @xmath19 26 m @xmath19 32 m. the ical has a rectangular shape with dimensions of 48 m @xmath19 16 m @xmath19 14.5 m. it consists of three modules each weighing @xmath33 17 kton .",
    "the baseline of the ical magnet configuration for each of the three modules consists of 151 layers of low carbon steel .",
    "the layers are alternated with gaps of 40 mm wherein will be placed active detectors , the resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) , to detect the charged particles produced in neutrino interactions with the iron nuclei .",
    "the ical rpc detectors give x , y hit information at @xmath33 0.96 cm spatial resolution , the layer number gives z @xmath53 position and timing information with a resolution ( @xmath54 ) @xmath33 1 ns  @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter will be magnetized with a piecewise uniform magnetic field ( b = 1@xmath531.5 t )  @xcite thereby being able to distinguish between the oppositely charged particles , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( produced due to charged current ( cc ) interaction of @xmath10 and @xmath57 , respectively ) , from the curvature of their tracks in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the ical detector is mainly sensitive to muons and hence to the interaction of the @xmath10/@xmath57 . for the electron type neutrino",
    ", the detection capability is limited because of the large iron plate thickness ( 5.6 cm ) compared to the radiation length of iron ( @xmath33 1.76 cm ) .",
    "the production of the tau lepton due to the tau - neutrino interaction is also small due to high threshold for tau production ( about 4 gev ) . due to this",
    ", the magnetized ical detector is most suited to measure muon neutrinos through the tracking of the associated muons and hadrons and reconstruction of their energy and momentum .",
    "the geant4 based simulation has been carried out to study the ical detector response for the muons and hadrons . at the relevant energies ,",
    "since the muon is a minimum ionizing particle , a clear track is produced in the ical detector .",
    "the ical simulation program uses the kalman filter technique , developed by the ino collaboration , to reconstruct the muon track .",
    "the typical efficiency of the detector for a 5 gev muon traveling vertically is about 80@xmath1 , while the typical charge identification efficiency is more than 95@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the energy of such a muon can typically be reconstructed with an accuracy of about 10@xmath1 , while its angular resolution is better than 1@xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the energy of the neutrino is the sum of the hadron ( e@xmath59 ) and muon ( e@xmath60 ) energies for a cc interaction .",
    "the hit multiplicity of charged particles distinct from the muon track can be used to estimate the total energy of hadrons in an event .",
    "the difference in energies of the interacting neutrino and the outgoing muon , e@xmath61 @xmath62 e@xmath63 @xmath53 e@xmath60 , has been calibrated against the number of hits in the detector due to the shower produced by hadrons .",
    "the measured number of hits can then be used to reconstruct the fractional energy carried by the hadron from the incoming neutrino . from the simulation study",
    ", it has been found that the energy resolution is about 85@xmath1 and 36@xmath1 for the hadron energies of 1 gev and 15 gev , respectively , in the central region of the ical detector @xcite .",
    "although the energy resolution of hadrons is much lower than that for muons , it still gives an additional information about the particular event , which can be used to improve the physics reach of the detector @xcite .",
    "the physics goal of the ical detector is to measure precisely the atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters , _",
    "viz_. @xmath64 and sin@xmath65 , @xcite and in particular , determine the neutrino mass hierarchy by measuring the sign of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "in addition , it can be used for octant sensitivity study @xmath66 whether @xmath67 is maximal or not , and if it is indeed non - maximal , whether @xmath67 is less than 45@xmath68 or greater than 45@xmath68  @xcite.the ical experiment would also be able to put severe constraints on new physics scenarios like cpt violation  @xcite .",
    "the sterile neutrino oscillation probabilities are based on expansion of the 3 generation pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix to 3  @xmath0  1 generation , where  3 \" stands for active and  1 \" for sterile neutrino , respectively .",
    "the neutrino flavors and mass eigenstates are related through @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mixing matrix . in this analysis",
    "the following parametrization has been considered @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the ( complex ) rotation matrices and @xmath73 are the mixing angles with @xmath74 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; and the order of rotation angles are considered from ref .",
    "@xcite . using the above definition ,",
    "neutrino flavor change can be described as a function of the mixing matrix elements and neutrino masses in terms of the neutrino oscillation probability @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 = e , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , s ; @xmath80= @xmath81 with @xmath25 , and @xmath37 is the source to detector distance and @xmath38 is the energy of neutrinos .",
    "the order of rotation angles shows that , if all mixing angles are zero , then there is a correspondence between the flavor and mass basis @xmath66 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath82 ) = ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath83 ) . assuming zero cp phase in lepton sector , in total , there are four new mixing parameters are introduced in the ( 3  @xmath0  1 ) neutrino model .",

    "it is to be noted that other two extra mass - squared differences , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , are not independent and can be expressed as @xmath88 = @xmath89 and @xmath90 = @xmath91 .",

    "the top panels show that while there is no oscillation of neutrinos for the standard 3 generation case whereas the 3  @xmath0  1 generations show a small depletion which is same for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",

    "note that the oscillation probabilities p@xmath115 and p@xmath116 are independent of the value of @xmath6 as per the parametrization of the mixing matrix , and the effect of @xmath6 comes entirely due to earth matter effects @xcite .",

    "there are mainly three processes which contribute to the cc interactions in the ical detector . at the sub - gev energy range ,",
    "the quasi - elastic process dominates , in which the final state muon carries most of the available energy . as the energy increases from sub - gev to multi - gev , hadrons and their showers are produced in resonance ( rs ) and deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes . in the rs process ,",
    "most of the hadron showers consist of a single pion , though multiple pions may contribute in a small fraction of events . on the other hand , in the dis process",
    "multiple hadrons are produced which carry a large fraction of the incoming neutrino energy . in the cc interaction of neutrino , for every hadron shower , there is a corresponding muon coming from the same cc interaction vertex of neutrino .    again , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] , the probability of active - sterile oscillations is valid only for down - going neutrinos , if one uses vacuum oscillations .",
