    "the bremsstrahlung cross section for relativistic electrons in a crystal is split into the sum of the coherent part ( due to the spatial periodicity of the atoms arrangement in the crystal ) and the incoherent one ( due to the thermal motion of atoms in the crystal ) @xcite .",
    "although the spectrum of incoherent radiation in crystal is similar to one in amorphous medium , the incoherent radiation intensity can demonstrate substantial dependence on the crystal orientation due to the electrons flux redistribution in the crystal ( channeling etc . ) .",
    "the simulation based on the semiclassical description of the radiation process @xcite confirms that viewpoint .",
    "the results of simulation are in a good agreement with the corresponding early @xcite and recent @xcite experimental data .    here",
    "we present the results of simulation using the improved procedure taking into account the crystal deformations .",
    "the simulation was carried out under the conditions of the recent experiment performed at the mainz microtron mami @xcite to explore the radiation emission from periodically bent crystal .",
    "the possibility of application of such crystals as undulators is discussed during last years @xcite .    for the reader convenience , in the next section we outline some theoretical ideas of our approach .",
    "let us consider the high energy electron incidence on the atomic string in the crystal .",
    "the two - dimensional multiple scattering angle @xmath0 is equal to the sum of individual scattering angles on the atoms : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the impact parameter of the collision with the _ n_-th atom of the crystal .",
    "the mean square of the multiple scattering angle ( averaged over the thermal vibrations of atoms ) can be expressed as the sum of two blocks of terms : @xmath3 the first block describes the coherent scattering which can be interpreted as a motion in the uniform string potential @xcite .",
    "the second one describes the incoherent scattering of the electron on the thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms .",
    "the bremsstrahlung spectrum of the electrons passing through the crystal also can be expressed as the sum of the coherent and incoherent contributions @xcite .",
    "for the electrons of the energy @xmath4 gev the main contribution of the coherent effect is made to the soft range of the spectrum ( the photon energy @xmath5 is less or of the order of dozens of mevs ) . in the medium and hard ranges of the spectrum",
    "the incoherent radiation is predominant .",
    "the spectral density of the incoherent radiation from the individual electron moving on the given trajectory is described by the formula @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron s mass and charge , @xmath9 is the velocity of light .",
    "it is convenient to compare the incoherent radiation intensity of the uniform electron beam in the crystal to the corresponding intensity in the amorphous medium ( described by bethe - heitler formula ) .",
    "the ratio of these two values is equal to @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of the electron s collisions with atoms under its motion through the crystal , @xmath12 is thomas - fermi radius of the atom , integration over @xmath13 means the integration over all possible points of incidence of the electron on the crystal in the limits of one elementary cell .",
    "the values of the function @xmath14 are determined by linear interpolation of the values pre - calculated on the regular grid of impact parameters .",
    "the impact parameters @xmath2 are found using the electron s trajectory obtained by numerical integration of the equation of motion in the field of the set of parallel uniform strings .",
    "the influence of the incoherent scattering by the thermal vibrations of atoms on the electron s trajectory can be taken into account by adding to each component of the electron s transverse velocity the random value with the dispersion @xmath15 after each collision .",
    "for the further computational details see @xcite",
    ".     to ( 110 ) plane of 30 @xmath16 thick si crystal @xcite .",
    "dotted line corresponds to the trajectories simulated neglecting thermal vibrations of atoms . *",
    "( d ) * the same for positrons ]",
    "the origin of the orientation dependence of the incoherent radiation intensity is illustrated on the figure 1 .",
    "when the electron is incident to the atomic plane of the crystal under angle @xmath17 less than some critical angle @xmath18 , it can be captured by the attractive potential of the plane .",
    "the finite motion in that potential is called as the planar channeling ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    under planar channeling the electrons collide with atoms under small impact parameters more frequently than in amorphous medium , that leads to the increase of the incoherent bremsstrahlung intensity ; for above - barrier motion the situation is opposite .",
    "the account of the incoherent scattering of the particles on the thermal vibrations of the atoms leads to dechanneling and , hence , to the smoothing of the describer orientation dependence ( compare solid and dotted lines on the figure 1 ( c ) and ( d ) ) .    in the present article",
    "the simulation was carried out under the conditions of the experiment @xcite , where the radiation from @xmath19 = 855 mev electrons under their incidence onto the silicon crystal with sinusoidally bent ( 110 ) planes had been studied .",
    "the yield of photons with the energy @xmath20 ( for which the incoherent mechanism of bremsstrahlung is predominant ) had been registered .     like in the experiment @xcite ]",
    "the results of simulation ( figure 2 ) demonstrate the qualitative agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "we can see characteristic structures similar to one on the figure 1 ( c ) , generated by different crystallographic planes with the common [ 1@xmath210 ] axis .",
    "the decrease of the radiation intensity in comparison to the reference flat crystal permits to estimate the reduction of the dechanneling length due to the crystal bending .",
    "we can see that the bending of the crystallographic planes increases the dechanneling rate so highly that the scattering on the thermal vibrations of atoms already have no substantial influence on the incoherent radiation intensity ( compare solid and dashed curves on the lower panel of the figure 2 ) .",
    "the main cause of the rapid dechanneling in the bent crystal lies in the arising of the centrifugal addition to the planar potential @xcite : @xmath22 m. assuming the planar potential has the shape of quadratic parabola with the depth @xmath23 ev for ( 110 ) plane , the effective potential in the domain of maximal curvature of the crystal would have the shape presented by the curve 2 on the figure 3 .",
    "we see substantial decrease of the potential wells depth comparing to the reference flat crystal ( curve 1 ) .",
    "so , only a small part of incident particles could be captured into the channeling regime .",
    "the incoherent bremsstrahlung yield exceedance ( deficiency ) from the electron ( positron ) beam in the oriented crystal in comparison to the value predicted by bethe - heitler formula for the amorphous medium can be used as an indicator of the relative amount of the particles moving in the channeling regime .",
    "the results of simulation demonstrate that the planar channeling effect leads to the orientation dependence of the incoherent bremsstrahlung intensity not only in flat , but also in bent crystals .",
    "however , in the bent crystal the electrons rapidly leave the planar channels .",
    "the figure 4 demonstrates that for the positron beam instead of the electron one the dechanneling rate would be almost the same .",
    "the effective capture of particles into planar channels ( and so the use of sinusoidally bent crystals as undulators ) is possible under changing the bending parameters to ensure smaller curvature than in the crystal @xcite .",
