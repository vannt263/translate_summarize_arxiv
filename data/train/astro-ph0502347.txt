    "low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) are detected in the nuclei of a large fraction of bright nearby galaxies ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) . since their definition as a class by heckman ( 1980 ) ,",
    "they have elicited debate as to their nature and relation , if any , to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "although the luminosities of most liners are unimpressive compared to `` classical '' agns , a variety of observables point to similarities and continuities between agns and at least some liners .",
    "to list some of these , at least 10% of liners show weak , broad , seyfert-1-like h@xmath0 wings in their spectra ( ho et al .",
    "1997b ) , and keck spectropolarimetry of several objects has revealed `` hidden blrs '' ( barth , filippenko , & moran 1999a , b ) , similar to those seen in some seyfert 2s ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; tran 1995 ) .",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "imaging shows that some 25% of liners have compact , often unresolved ( i.e. , @xmath3 few pc ) , bright uv sources in their nuclei ( maoz et al .",
    "1995 ; barth et al .",
    "1998 ) . optical imaging with wfpc2 on hst of 14 liners ( pogge et al . 2000 ) suggests that all nearby liners ( including the 75% that are `` uv - dark '' , i.e. , those that do not reveal a nuclear uv source at hst sensitivity , @xmath4 ) likely have such a nuclear uv source , but that it is often obscured by circumnuclear dust .    in the radio , at very large array ( vla ) resolution ( @xmath5 tens of pc ) , about half of liners display unresolved radio cores at 2  cm and 3.6  cm ( nagar et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) . at 6  cm , with very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) resolution ( @xmath6 pc ) , these cores remain unresolved , strongly arguing for the presence of an agn ( falcke & biermann 1999 ; falcke et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the radio core fluxes have been found to be variable by factors of up to a few in about half of the @xmath7 liners observed multiple times over 3 years ( nagar et al .",
    "a radio survey for 1.3  cm water megamaser emission , an indicator of dense circumnuclear molecular gas , detected liner nuclei at the same rate as type-2 seyfert nuclei ( braatz et al .",
    "such megamaser emission is seen only in agns .",
    "some liners have indications of a seyfert - like ionization cone oriented along their radio axis ( pogge et al . 2000 ) .",
    "at x - ray energies , rosat hri images showed compact ( @xmath8 ) soft x - ray emission in 70% of liners and seyferts ( roberts & warwick 2000 ) which , when observed with asca , were found to have a nonthermal 2 - 10 kev spectrum ( e.g. , terashima , ho , & ptak 2000 ) .",
    "arcsecond - resolution chandra observations by terashima & wilson ( 2003 ) of 11 liners , each of which was preselected to have a radio core , revealed an x - ray nucleus in all but one case , and the nuclei were generally ( but not always ) unresolved .",
    "the super - massive black holes in the nuclei of most normal galaxies ( e.g. , tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , many of which are also liners , could be the remnants of ancient quasars / seyferts , now accreting at a low rate and/or radiating inefficiently ( e.g. , reynolds et al .",
    "1996 ) , and producing these multiwavelength signatures .",
    "if liners represent the low - luminosity end of the agn phenomenon , then they are the nearest and most common examples , and their study is germane to understanding agn demographics and evolution , and the x - ray background",
    ".    however , an unambiguous optical / uv link between the liner and agn classes has remained elusive .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) analyzed the hst uv spectra of seven `` uv - bright '' liners and showed that , in at least some of them , most or all of the compact uv continuum emission is produced by a cluster of massive stars , whose energy output may be sufficient to account for the optical recombination lines .",
    "even in the few objects showing broad , quasar - like emission lines , one can not say conclusively whether the uv continuum source is stellar or nonstellar , because the broad emission lines coincide in wavelength with the main expected stellar absorptions .",
    "x - ray and radio data have provided convincing evidence for the presence of agns in _ some _ of these objects .",
    "however , they can not identify the source of the optical emission lines , which are excited by uv radiation ( beyond the lyman limit ) , and the entire liner definition rests on the ratios of these emission lines .",
    "there is thus the possibility that the liner phenomenon and central black holes are not physically connected , but simply coexist in many galaxies because both are common .",
    "variability is one of the defining properties of agns .",
    "variability can reveal an agn origin of an emission component , even when broad lines are not detected and much of the continuum emission is produced by a nuclear star cluster . for example , in both of the liners ngc  4569 and ngc  404 , maoz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that the uv spectrum has the broad absorptions in c  iv  @xmath9 and n  v  @xmath10 due to winds from o - type stars .",
    "however , the relative shallowness of these features in ngc  404 means the o - star light is diluted by another component .",
    "this component could be lower - mass stars ( b and a dwarfs ) in the same cluster , or it could be a featureless agn component .",
    "repeated observations could potentially detect uv variations , thereby exposing an agn component in the uv , even when much of the continuum emission is produced by a nuclear star cluster .",
    "indeed , there have been several reports of uv variability in liners .",
    "barth et al .",
    "( 1996 ) compared their hst / fos spectrum of ngc  4579 to the hst / foc f220w measurement of maoz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and found a factor of 3 decrease in the flux of the central source over the 19-month period between the observations .",
    "cappellari et al . ( 1999 ) compared foc observations of ngc  4552 taken in 1991 , 1993 , and 1996 , and found a factor of 4.5 brightening between the first two epochs , followed by factor of 2 dimming between the last two epochs . while these detections of uv variability were suggestive , they were not conclusive from the technical aspect , because the observational setup was different at each epoch . in the case of ngc  4579 , one is comparing a broad - band measurement to a spectroscopic one , where aperture misplacement is always a danger . in the case of ngc  4552 ,",
    "the three measurements were both pre- and post - hst - spherical - abberration correction , and in different foc formats , having different dynamic and non - linearity ranges , and different fields of view .",
    "other indications of uv variability in liners have been indirect , e.g. , the appearance of broad ( sometimes double - peaked ) balmer emission - line wings in some galaxies with liner spectra ( e.g. , storchi - bergmann et al . 1995 ) .",
    "if the reported uv variations in liners are real , it would mean that : + 1",
    ". some of the uv emission of these liners is of an agn nature ; + 2 . liner variations are common ( since uv variations were detected in the few galaxies that were observed more than once ) ; and + 3 .",
    "large - amplitude ( factor @xmath11 ) variations on few - year timescales are the norm .",
    "this would contrast with seyferts 1s , where typical uv variations are @xmath12 , and quasars , where variations of only tenths of a magnitude are most common ( e.g. , giveon et al . 1999 ) .",
    "+ confirming ( or refuting ) the above results on a carefully - selected sample could therefore provide the missing link between liner emission and agns , and supply important new input to the phenomenology of agn variability and its dependence on luminosity .",
    "quantifying the stellar and agn contributions to the uv is also important for correctly comparing the continuum emission of low - luminosity agns with models .",
    "while in quasars and seyferts the uv continuum in generally attributed to a standard thin accretion disk ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , in low - luminosity agns the nature of the uv continuum is still a matter of debate . in models such as advection",
    "/ convection dominated accretion flows ( adafs / cdafs ; e.g. , quataert et al .",
    "1999 ) , the emission is from the hot accretion flow itself .",
    "alternatively , yuan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and falcke et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have postulated that not only the radio emission , but also the optical / uv / x - rays in low - luminosity objects could be nonthermal emission , likely from the jet itself , with the jet emission becoming dominant as the disk becomes radiatively inefficient . in the latter picture ,",
    "one postulates a transition from a thermally dominated spectrum to a non - thermal ( possibly jet - dominated ) spectrum as one goes from black holes accreting near the eddington limit ( quasars and seyferts ) to black holes with sub - eddington accretion .",
    "stronger uv variability in low - luminosity agns could be a signature of this transition .    in the current paper , we present results from a monitoring program using hst to search for uv variability in a sample of liners over timescales of weeks to 10 years .",
    "compared to previous , serendipitous , detections of variability , our program was designed to study this question systematically , using a stable observational setup and a representative sample of uv - bright liners .",
    "our sample includes all objects seen to have compact central uv sources in existing hst data as known by us in 2001 , and classified optically as liners by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) based on their optical emission line ratios .",
    "the 17 liners in the sample include a variety of liner sub - types : liners having broad h@xmath0 wings ( which we will designate `` liner 1s '' ) , and those having only narrow emission lines ( `` liner 2s '' ) ; liners whose uv spectra show signatures of massive stars , and those that do not ; and some liners that , in terms of optical classification , are borderline with seyferts or with h  ii nuclei .",
    "we will refer to all these objects collectively as either liner  1s or liner  2s , depending on the presence or absence of broad h@xmath0 wings .",
    "wings as liner  1.9 objects . since this is the only kind of type-1 liner in the sample of ho et al .",
    "( i.e. , there are no known examples of liner  1.2 , 1.5 , etc . )",
    ", we will simply refer to liner  1.9s as liner  1s .",
    "three of the objects in our sample are classified by ho et al . as seyferts , since their narrow emission line ratios [ oiii ]  @xmath13/h@xmath14 are above the defining border between liners and seyferts by @xmath15 ( for m81 and ngc  3486 ) and by a factor @xmath11 ( for ngc  4258 ) .",
    "the border is somewhat arbitrary ( see , e.g. , the distribution of emission - line nuclei from the sloan digital sky survey on the diagnostic diagrams shown by kauffmann et al . 2003 ) , so we consider the former two objects also as borderline liner / seyfert cases , and the latter as a low - luminosity seyfert . ]",
    "vla imaging at 2  cm and 3.6  cm has revealed a radio core in 11 of the objects , and variability has been detected ( nagar et al .",
    "2002 ) in five of those that have been monitored .",
    "tables 1 and 2 list the objects in the sample and summarize some of their previously known properties .",
    "imaging of the sample was carried out with the hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) with its high resolution camera ( hrc ) mode .",
    "the field of view of this ccd - based instrument is about @xmath16 , with a scale of @xmath17  pixel@xmath18 .",
    "each target was imaged in the f250w band ( @xmath19   , fwhm@xmath20   ) with exposure times ranging from 5 to 25  min , depending on target brightness , and in the f330w band ( @xmath21   , fwhm@xmath22   ) with an exposure time of 5  min .",
    "( the brightest target , ngc  4569 , was exposed for just 1  min in each band . ) the exposure time was split between two equal exposures that were used in the data reduction process to reject cosmic - ray events .",
    "objects were repeatedly scheduled using hst s snapshot mode , i.e. , these short exposures were chosen by the hst schedulers , as dictated by convenience , in order to fill gaps left in the schedule after normal - mode observations had been scheduled .",
    "this means that both the number of epochs at which a given target was actually observed and the spacing between epochs were largely random . between july 1 , 2002 and july 2 , 2003 , 15 of the 17 liners were observed from two to five times each .",
    "two objects , ngc  404 and ngc  1052 , were observed only once .",
    "hst failed to acquire guide stars in two exposures , of ngc  3642 on december 17 , 2002 , and of ngc  3486 on february 13 , 2003 .",
    "the resulting failed data will be ignored here .",
    "we supplemented our data with archival data obtained with the same observational setup for two of the objects , using the f330w filter : one epoch for ngc  3486 from june 3 , 2003 , and one for ngc  4258 from december 7 , 2002 .",
    "table 1 lists the exposure times and epochs of each target .",
    "[ imagemosaic ]    figure 1 shows acs image sections around each of the liner nuclei .",
    "compared with previous uv images of these objects with the foc , wfpc1 , and wfpc2 instruments , the improvement in resolution , sensitivity , and linearity reveals , in some cases , fine structures and details that were not clearly seen before . however , the morphologies characterized by isolated , compact or unresolved , nuclear uv sources are consistent with the previous images by maoz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and barth et al .",
    "this simple morphology also facilitates the photometric measurements described below .",
    "data were reduced automatically by the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) pipeline .",
    "this includes bias and overscan subtraction , cosmic - ray rejection and combination of the two split exposures , dark subtraction , flat - fielding , and geometric distortion correction . to assure uniform reduction using",
    "the latest available flats and distortion - correction algorithms , the entire dataset was re - retrieved from the hst archive and processed on - the - fly on may 4 , 2004 .      of great concern in a program such as",
    "this is the photometric stability of the camera .",
    "this concern is heightened by the fact that , given the small field of view , the short exposures , and the old stellar population of the galaxy bulges in which liners are preferentially found , the compact nucleus is generally the only bright feature in the image , and relative photometry is not possible .",
    "indeed , wfpc2 , the acs s predecessor ccd imager on hst , suffers from severe and variable molecular contamination on its front window , which causes large variations with time in uv sensitivity .",
    "acs was expected not to be afflicted by such a problem , since it does not have a cold window on which contaminants can condense .",
    "however , as our program was executed on the first observing cycle after the installation of acs , the actual in - flight uv sensitivity stability was not known , and must be addressed when assessing the reality of any detected uv variations .    fortunately , stsci staff carried out a program to monitor the uv photometric stability of acs / hrc , including the two filters we used , contemporaneously with our program . as reported by boffi , bohlin , & de marchi ( 2004 ) , the open star cluster ngc",
    "6681 was observed 19 times from may 2002 to july 2003 .",
    "observations were roughly bi - weekly until mid - november 2002 , then paused , and resumed in mid - february 2003 , roughly once a month . not only was the observational setup identical to ours , but the total exposure time per filter ( 140  s split into two exposures ) was comparable to the one we used ( 300  s for most targets ) , and the brightnesses of the stars ( 20,000 - 30,000 total counts per star within an 8.5-pixel radius ) in this test field were similar to those of the compact nuclei in our program .",
    "boffi et al .",
    "show light curves for eight of the stars in the field , and report that the uv sensitivities in both f250w and f330w are stable `` to 1% '' .    to obtain a more quantitative estimate of the photometric stability",
    ", we used the plots of boffi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to calculate the actual rms scatter of each star s light curve in each filter .",
    "we also measured the brightness of each of these stars in several of the reduced images of ngc  6681 that we retrieved from the hst archive .",
    "we then subtracted , in quadrature from the rms scatter of each light curve , the readout noise due to the pixels within an 8.5-pixel radius in two exposures , and the poisson noise due to the total counts , to obtain the remaining scatter due to other sources of noise .",
    "we designate this remaining noise as the `` photometric scatter '' .",
    "we find that , among the 16 stellar light curves ( 8 stars in two bands each ) , the photometric scatter ranges from zero ( i.e. , the rms of a light curve is at the level expected from poisson noise and readout noise alone ) up to 1.1% .",
    "four of the light curves have photometric scatter near zero , eight have scatter from 0.4% to 0.7% , and four have scatter of about 1% .",
    "we do not find a correspondence between the photometric scatter of a light curve and any obvious parameter , such as the identity of a star , its position on the chip , its brightness , or its color .",
    "in fact , some of the stars with the highest scatter in one band have the lowest scatter in the other band , even though at each epoch the two bands were obtained consecutively , with shifts of only a few pixels between exposures . since a sizeable fraction ( 25% ) of the stellar light curves show photometric scatter of about 1% , and since the first purpose of the present study is to test the null hypothesis that liners do not vary , we will conservatively assume that the acs / hrc has a photometric rms scatter of 1% in both the f250w and the f330w bands .",
    "we will adopt this figure as the photometric calibration uncertainty of our measurements , to be combined with the other , statistical , sources of error .",
    "we used iraf to perform aperture photometry of the nuclear source in each image .",
    "counts were summed within a 10-pixel - radius ( @xmath23 ) aperture centered on the source .",
    "the background level was determined from the median counts in an annulus at radii of 14 to 18 pixels .",
    "experimenting with the more constant among the nuclear sources ( e.g. , ngc  4569 ) , we found that an aperture radius of @xmath24  pixels is required in order to obtain photometric stability of better than 1% between epochs .",
    "this is consistent with the use of 8.5-pixel - radius apertures by boffi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the photometric stability tests described above .",
    "errors were calculated by combining in quadrature the poisson errors of the counts , the readout - noise errors from the pixels within the aperture in the two split exposures ( assuming a readout noise of 4.71  e  pixel@xmath18 ) , and the adopted photometric scatter of 1% .",
    "counts and their errors were multiplied by 1.25 ( for f250w ) and by 1.18 ( for f330w ) to correct for the finite aperture radii , based on the point - source encircled energy curves in the acs data handbook ( pavlovsky et al .",
    "finally , count rates were converted to flux densities using the conversion given by the photflam keyword in the image headers , 1  e  s@xmath25 ( f250w ) , and 1  e  s@xmath26 ( f330w ) .",
    "this conversion assumes a spectral shape that is flat in @xmath27 , which is a reasonable approximation for these objects  their uv colors ( see below ) imply a spectral slope in the range @xmath28 , for an assumed spectral shape @xmath29 .",
    "three galaxies , ngc  4736 , ngc  5055 , and ngc  6500 , merit separate mention .",
    "ngc  4736 , apart from its nuclear uv source ( which is clearly centered on a diffuse , centrally peaked stellar light distribution ) displays a second uv point source , @xmath1 north of the nuclear uv source .",
    "the flux from the off - nuclear source , which we designate ngc  4736b , was measured exactly as for the other nuclear sources .",
    "the off - nuclear source will be further discussed below .",
    "ngc  5055 , has a central source which is resolved , with an observed full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of about 5.5  pixels ( @xmath30 ) , as opposed to the 2 - 3  pixel fwhm typical of point sources . in its second epoch , on march 12 , 2003 ,",
    "it is significantly _ more _ extended in both bands , with a fwhm of 7  pixels , perhaps due to spacecraft jitter . to prevent both the normal large width and the anomalous epoch from adversely affecting the photometry",
    ", we used a 13-pixel aperture in this case , which increases the flux by 20% but eliminates a spurious 3% decline at this epoch .",
    "ngc  6500 does not have a clearly defined nuclear source .",
    "instead , it has a diffuse central light distribution , on which are superposed a number of faint sources , some compact and some extended .",
    "although this structure was already known from previous imaging with wfpc2 by barth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we included this galaxy in the sample since it has various known agn properties ( a radio core ",

    "1997 ) , keeping in mind the possibility that one of the faint sources in the wfpc2 image could have been the active nucleus , perhaps temporarily in a low state .",
    "to encompass within the aperture the diffuse nuclear light from this galaxy , we used an aperture radius of 20 , rather than 10 , pixels .",

    "( note that these statistics are affected by the different number of epochs and time intervals for each object . )",
    "as summarized in  1 , uv variability in some of these liners has been reported before . however , this is the first time such variability is seen on relatively short timescales , and it is detected using an unchanging , and photometrically very stable , observational setup (  3.2 ) .",
    "the variable flux provides a firm lower limit on the agn contribution to the uv flux at each band .",
    "we see that variability , and hence an agn contribution , exists in some members of both liner classes , 1 and 2 .",
    "this situation is distinct from the one in seyfert galaxies . in seyferts , the agn continuum that is visible in type-1 objects",
    "is obscured in type 2s , in which the observed uv continuum is sometimes scattered agn light and sometimes produced by young stars in the circumnuclear region ( e.g. , gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "1998 ) , and , in either case , is not expected to be variable on @xmath38  year or shorter timescales .",
    "our finding that variability is seen in at least some liner 2s suggests that the `` unified scheme '' , believed to apply to seyferts , may not always apply to liners .    in terms of longer timescale",
    "variability , comparison of the uv flux levels we measure to the `` historical '' ones shown with a solid line in figure  2 reveals likely large - amplitude variations even in some objects that were not seen to vary during the present campaign , either because they were sampled too closely or too infrequently , or because they were temporarily inactive .",

    "( 2003 ) using the acs / hrc with the f220w filter , and was shown to vary in flux , consistent with previous reports of optical variability by tsvetanov et al .",
    "this leaves only three out of the 17 liner nuclei that appear to be constant on both short ( months ) and long ( up to 10 years ) timescales .",
    "these constant objects are ngc  3486 , ngc  4569 , and ngc  5055 .",
    "we can conclude , therefore , that uv variability is a common property of the majority of liners .",
    "the nuclear uv source in ngc  4736 appears variable in f250w , but only at the 95% confidence level , and is constant in f330w .",

    "the uncertainty is driven by the weakness of the emission lines , which in the ground - based optical spectrum are superposed on bright stellar emission from the center of the galaxy .",
    "since the narrow emission lines are so faint , an even - weaker broad component would have been impossible to detect , and the classification of ngc  4552 as a type-1 or type-2 liner was limited by the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectral data ( l.c . ho , private communication ) . indeed , cappellari et al .",

    "perhaps ngc  4569 is a peculiar case of a starburst - driven liner , and therefore differs from other liner  2s also in its uv color .",
    "if our apologies for the excluded and the outlier nuclei are justified , and there is a true uv color distinction between liner  1s and liner  2s , this may be the first independent observable that can predict the existence of broad h@xmath0 in a liner , even if only for liners that are at the extreme red and blue ends of the color distribution .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the redness of liner 2s is produced by intervening dust , and that this dust somehow obscures the broad - line region , in some analogy to the unification schemes applicable to seyfert 1s and 2s .",

    "there is , at most , a factor @xmath39 difference in the uv color ratio of the liner 1s and liner 2s ( see fig .",

    "if anything , one would expect the broad emission lines , which come from an extended region , to be even less attenuated than the continuum .",
    "in other words , in liner  2s the `` hidden '' broad h@xmath0 flux would be lowered by a factor @xmath40 , relative to liner 1 s .",
    "such a small reduction would probably not hinder the detection of broad components in type-2 objects , many of which are quite bright . to further investigate a possible role of dust ,",

    "( 1997a ) .",
    "no trend was found .",
    "there is also no obvious relation between uv color and radio power , as tabulated by nagar et al .",
    "thus , the uv color may indicate some other link between the shape of the nonstellar continuum and the presence or the visibility of a broad - line region .",
    "on the other hand , even in high - luminosity agn , there is seldom good agreement between dust extinction measures at different wavelengths , probably because of a combination of optical depth and geometry effects .",
    "furthermore , considering the challenge of detecting weak broad h@xmath0 wings , a factor 2 reduction may play some role after all . for example , by isolating galactic nuclei from the surrounding stellar light using the small spectroscopic apertures possible with hst , several liners , although previously classified as liner 1s from the ground , have revealed also broad double - peaked h@xmath0 profiles ( ho et al .",
    "2000 ; shields et al .",
    "thus , further work is required both to confirm the suggested trend of uv color with type , and to understand the effect .      in terms of the temporal variation in uv color of the sources , one can see from table  2 that the color remains constant , to within the errors , when the flux varies .",
    "the sole exception is ngc  4203 , which is significantly bluer when it is brighter , as is commonly observed in many high - luminosity agns ( e.g. , giveon et al .",

    "however , we are not certain of the reality of the 5% decline at the last epoch for a number of reasons : the large aperture and the diffuse nature of the object increase the susceptibility of the measurement to small fluctuations due to centering differences .",

    "variability is detected irrespective of spectral type ( 1 or 2 ) and whether or not a nuclear radio source has been detected .",
    "liners are present in the majority of massive galaxies , and the true fraction of liner galaxies that have a nuclear uv source , after accounting for extinction , is likely close to unity ( barth et al .",
    "1998 ; pogge et al .",
    "this conclusion implies that , not only do most galaxies have central black holes , but that the black holes are also accreting and emitting in the uv .",
    "the extreme - uv extension of the observed uv , beyond the lyman limit , is the main ionizing agent in these objects , and it determines the optical line ratios that define liners and distinguish them from other nuclei ( e.g. , h  ii , seyfert ) .",
    "our results provide some of the strongest evidence to date that , in the majority of cases , a liner spectrum in fact signals the presence of nonstellar activity ( i.e. , an agn ) .",
    "our data confirm previous reports of large - amplitude uv variability in several liners ( see  1 ) , but now with a stable photometric setup , applied systematically to a moderate - sized sample .",
    "we have identified only three galaxies with uv nuclei that show neither short - term ( @xmath104  yr ) nor long - term ( @xmath105  yr ) variations . in all three cases ,",
    "there is previous evidence that stars dominate the uv emission  based on uv spectra in ngc  4569 and ngc  5055 ( maoz et al .",
    "1998 ) , and on the seyfert 2 classification ( ho et al .",
    "1997a ) in the case of ngc  3486 , combined with the fact that the observed uv emission in seyfert 2s often comes from stars ( gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "however , even in these three cases , it is possible that uv variability would be detected in an experiment with denser or longer - term sampling .",

    "of course , there are three galaxies ( ngc  404 , ngc  3368 , and ngc  3642 ) with no detected radio core that do display uv variations , but radio cores may be revealed by more sensitive observations of these objects . if deeper radio observations revealed cores in the three uv - variable liners , but not in the three uv - stable liners , a perfect correspondence would exist between the presence of radio cores and uv variability .    could stars produce the observed uv variations ?",
    "the 2500     luminosities of the variable nuclei in our sample , as seen in table  2 , are distributed more or less evenly in the range @xmath106 .",
    "the most luminous `` normal '' stars are blue supergiants , among which those with effective temperatures of @xmath107 ( spectral classes b0a0 ) have the highest near - uv luminosities .",
    "bresolin et al . (",
    "2004 ) recently monitored 70 blue supergiants in the galaxy ngc  300 over a 5-month period , and found 15 of them to be variable , with @xmath108-band amplitudes of @xmath109 .",
    "the mean @xmath108 band absolute magnitude of these variable supergiants is @xmath110 , and the most luminous one ( of spectral type b9 ) has @xmath111 . using spectral models by kurucz for b9 supergiants to obtain the flux ratio between the @xmath108 band and 2500   , the uv luminosities for the typical and for the most luminous supergiants are @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "thus , even the least luminous galactic nuclei in our sample have luminosities about an order of magnitude larger than typical blue supergiants , but short - term variability amplitudes of 1520% , comparable to those of the most variable supergiants .",
    "furthermore , the large amplitude variations we see in many of the liners are not expected in supergiants .",
    "therefore , individual supergiants in the galactic nuclei are not plausible candidates for producing the observed level of uv variability in the liners .",
    "stars more luminous than blue supergiants , by an order of magnitude , do exist  wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( e.g. , conti 2000 ) and luminous blue variables ( lbvs ; e.g. , humphreys & davidson 1994 ) with bolometric luminosities up to @xmath114",
    ". these are massive stars , nearing the end of their evolution and radiating near the eddington limit .",
    "lbv variation amplitudes on timescales of months are @xmath115 ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) , whereas wn8 stars , which are the most variable among wrs , sometimes vary in the optical by a few percent on week - to - month timescales ( marchenko et al .",
    "based on luminosity and variation amplitude alone , individual lbvs and wr stars could perhaps produce the uv variations in part of the lower - luminosity half of our sample .",
    "however , the variations seen in the most luminous objects in our sample certainly can not be explained in this way , and , based on continuity , one can then argue that stars are not the source of variations in any of the liners .",
    "nevertheless , we can not rule out the possibility that individual evolved stars dominate the light output in a few of the low - luminosity objects .",
    "for example , spectroscopy of ngc  4736b , with a luminosity of @xmath116 , could reveal if it is a lbv or wr star , rather than a second merging nucleus .",
    "returning to the agn interpretation , the _ variable _ flux that we have measured in each uv band , in the absence of any extinction corrections , provides a firm _ lower _ limit to the agn flux in that band .",
    "this observed lower limit can be used to test accretion models for each of these low - luminosity agns .",
    "it can also be argued that the _ total _ uv flux provides an _ upper _ limit on the uv emission , but the sensitivity of the uv to uncertain extinction corrections makes such an upper limit less robust .",
    "the vlba images of falcke et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and nagar et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that at least some of the radio emission in liners is contributed by jets , rather than by an actual accretion flow .",
    "anderson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have obtained multifrequency vlba spectra for the unresolved milli - arcsecond core in six low - luminosity agns ( including three liners , two of which , ngc  4203 and ngc  4579 , are in our sample ) .",
    "they showed that the radio spectra are inconsistent with expectations from accretion flows ( cf .",
    "nagar et al . 2001 ) , but that the spectra , luminosity , and size limits are consistent with emission from jets that are pointed toward us to within @xmath117 .",
    "the observed radio flux must therefore constitute only an upper limit on radio emission from the accretion flow itself .",
    "strictly speaking , x - ray data , too , provide only upper limits to the flux from the accretion flow , since even with the excellent spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , non - nuclear x - ray sources ( low - mass x - ray binaries , supernova remnants , diffuse emission ) can be included in the beam , and may contribute to the x - ray flux . as an extreme example , in m32 the nuclear x - ray source produces only 1% of the total x - ray luminosity within a radius of 30  pc of the nucleus ( ho et al .",
    "2003 ) , yet this is the area covered by a @xmath118-diameter beam at 10  mpc , the typical distance to a galaxy in our sample .",
    "nevertheless , the excellent astrometric agreement ( @xmath119 ) beween x - ray and radio positions in low - luminosity agns ( e.g. , terashima & wilson 2003 ) , and the absence of close by ( @xmath120 few arcseconds ) x - ray sources indicates that , in most such agns , the x - rays originate from the active nucleus .    at optical and ir wavelengths , the nuclear emission can not be detected , at present , in the face of the bright stellar backgrounds , and in the extreme - uv only indirect , model - dependent estimates of the sed can be obtained by attempting to reproduce the uv - through - ir emission line fluxes and ratios . the current flux limits ( lower limits to the emission from the accretion flow in the uv , from our present results , and upper limits in the radio and x - rays , from previous observations ) thus provide a potentially powerful test of accretion models .",
    "the observed sed can similarly be compared to the predictions of jet models . in this case",
    ", the uv emission should be connected to emission at other wavelengths and to the assumed black - hole mass by a relation analogous to the radio / x - ray correlation seen in low - accretion - rate black holes ( merloni et al .",
    "2003 ; falcke et al .",
    "2004 ) we intend to carry out such comparisons to models in a future paper .",
    "our data for ngc  4736 have revealed the first example of a variable off - nuclear uv source , giving new grounds to previous speculation ( maoz et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) that this is a `` wandering black hole '' from the nucleus of another galaxy that has recently merged with this one .",
    "this hypothesis ( and the alternative , that it is an individual wr or lbv star , see above ) can be tested with straightforward high - spatial - resolution observations in radio , optical , uv , and x - ray bands .",
    "the observational evidence for the existence of systems of massive black hole pairs has been reviewed recently by komossa ( 2003 ) .",
    "the best current candidate for a double agn is ngc  6240 , a relatively nearby ( redshift @xmath121 ) ultraluminous infrared galaxy .",
    "both nuclei of ngc  6240 are probably liners ( raffanelli et al .",
    "1997 ) , both are compact radio sources at 1.4 and 5  ghz ( colbert et al .",
    "1994 ; gallimore & beswick 2004 ) , and both emit hard x - ray continua and fe  k@xmath0 lines ( komossa et al .",
    "the @xmath122 separation of the nuclei in ngc  6240 , for an assumed distance of 100  mpc , corresponds to a projected physical scale of @xmath123  pc , compared to only 60  pc between the possible double nuclei of ngc  4736 .",
    "another , somewhat more ambiguous , case is ngc  3256 , a merging galaxy system at a distance of about 40  mpc . in this case ,",
    "two nuclear sources , with a projected separation of @xmath124 , i.e. , about 1  kpc , are detected in near - infrared and x - rays ( lira et al .",
    "2002 ) and in radio ( neff et al . 2003 ) , with a radio - to - x - ray flux ratio that is characteristic of low - luminosity agn . in the central cd galaxy of the cluster",
    "abell 400 , the twin - jetted double radio source 3c  75 ( owen et al . 1985 ) , is a spectacular example of a binary agn , though with a rather large separation of 7  kpc .",
    "identification and study of new examples of binary agn , especially as nearby as ngc  4736 , can shed light on the issue of the rate of coalescence of supermassive black holes ( e.g. , quinlan & hernquist 1997 ) .",
    "we have found a possible uv - color - based indicator of whether a liner is a type-1 or type-2 object .",
    "if confirmed , this would be the first liner property that is found to be linked with the presence or absence of a broad balmer emission line component .",
    "as we have argued above , reddening by dust is not obviously the mechanism behind the suggested trend ",
    "the factor @xmath39 difference in the uv color ratio of type 1s and type 2s , if produced by a dust screen , would correspond to a mere factor of 2.4 increase in the extinction of a hypothetical broad h@xmath0 line in liner 2s .",
    "instead , we argue that the instrinsic color of the uv continuum is related to the existence or the visibility of a blr . for example , the physical conditions under which a blr can form could depend on the present accretion mode , which might be reflected in the uv color .",
    "nevertheless , as we have pointed out , some combination of dust , geometry , optical depth and selection effects may be , after all , behind the observed trend of uv color with liner spectral type .",
    "furthermore , the trend itself needs to be confirmed with a larger sample .",
    "this is not a simple task , since we have imaged all known liners that have a compact nucleus in the space - uv .",
    "a larger sample of such objects could be assembled by means of uv imaging ( e.g. , with galex ) and subsequent optical spectroscopic classification to identify the liners .",
    "uv imaging need not necessarily be from space  the uv nuclei of our current sample are prominent in the f330w band , so such objects could potentially be indentified by ground - based observations near the atmospheric uv cutoff .",

    "<S> liner nuclei , which are present in many nearby galactic bulges , may be the manifestation of low - rate or low - radiative - efficiency accretion onto supermassive central black holes . however , it has been unclear whether the compact ultraviolet ( uv ) nuclear sources present in many liners are clusters of massive stars , rather than being directly related to the accretion process . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the hubble space telescope to monitor the uv variability of a sample of 17 galaxies with liner nuclei and compact nuclear uv sources . </S>",
    "<S> fifteen of the 17 galaxies were observed more than once , with two to five epochs per galaxy , spanning up to a year . </S>",
    "<S> we detect significant variability in most of the sample , with peak - to - peak amplitudes from a few percent to 50% . in most cases , </S>",
    "<S> correlated variations are seen in two independent bands ( f250w and f330w ) . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to previous uv measurements indicates , for many objects , long - term variations by factors of a few over decade timescales . </S>",
    "<S> variability is detected in liners with and without detected compact radio cores , in liners that have broad h@xmath0 wings detected in their optical spectra ( `` liner 1 s '' ) , and in those that do not ( `` liner 2s '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> this variability demonstrates the existence of a non - stellar component in the uv continuum of all types , and sets a lower limit to the luminosity of this component . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , all the liners that have detected radio cores have variable uv nuclei , as one would expect from _ bona fide _ agns . </S>",
    "<S> we note a trend in the uv color ( f250w / f330w ) with spectral type  </S>",
    "<S> liner 1s tend to be bluer than liner  2s . </S>",
    "<S> this trend may indicate a link between the shape of the nonstellar continuum and the presence or the visibility of a broad - line region . in one target , the post - starburst galaxy ngc 4736 , we detect variability in a previously noted uv source that is offset by @xmath1 ( @xmath2  pc in projection ) from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this may be the nearest example of a binary active nucleus , and of the process leading to black hole merging . </S>"
