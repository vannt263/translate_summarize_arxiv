    "the difference between both notions is only whether one deals with proper or improper edge colorings , but the related vertex coloring is always required to be proper . since a proper edge coloring is improper as well , the existence of improper twin @xmath8-edge colorings for some @xmath8 comes from the existence of proper ones .",

    "note however that removing an edge colored with 0 obviously leaves an improper twin @xmath8-edge coloring in the remaining graph .",
    "[ rem3 ] unlike the usual vertex / edge coloring problems , an improper twin @xmath8-edge coloring is not necessarily an improper twin @xmath13-edge coloring for @xmath14 .",
    "this is due to the @xmath79 or @xmath80 operations respectively used in the definition of twin @xmath13- and twin @xmath8-edge coloring .",
    "consider indeed a star with a center vertex @xmath81 and four pending vertices @xmath82 .",
    "the edge coloring assigning color 1 to all the four edges is an improper twin 2-edge coloring but not an improper twin 3-edge coloring .      in this paper",
    "we investigate the improper twin edge chromatic index of graphs and we consider , to the best of our knowledge , the first time , the complexity of a neighbor - distinguishing edge coloring problem .",
    "the following summarizes the main contribution of @xcite and @xcite :    ( @xcite ) [ thm : mainfromjcmcc ] let @xmath0 be a connected graph of order at least 3",

    "it should be noted that this result is obtained as a combination of several results from @xcite and @xcite . in section [ sec : general ] , we provide a shorter and more compact proof of theorem [ thm : mainfromjcmcc ] .",
    "actually we obtain a more precise result ( see theorem  [ thm : final ] ) describing a constructive way to build in linear time an improper twin edge coloring using @xmath8 or @xmath15 colors , whenever a @xmath8-vertex coloring is provided .    in  @xcite it is shown that for non - bipartite connected graphs @xmath0 and odd @xmath86 , any @xmath13-vertex coloring can be induced by an improper @xmath13-edge coloring .",
    "we give an alternative proof of this result ( proposition  [ oddc ] ) and give a necessary and sufficient condition for a @xmath13-vertex coloring with even @xmath13 being induced by an improper twin @xmath13-edge coloring in a non - bipartite connected graph ( proposition  [ equal ] ) .",
    "moreover , these two results , together with theorem  [ bip ] allow us to establish the following _ monotonicity _ property of the improper twin chromatic index for graphs : if a graph @xmath0 admits an improper twin @xmath8-edge coloring for some positive integer @xmath8 , then it admits an improper twin @xmath13-edge coloring for all @xmath14 ( theorem  [ thm : at least k ] ) .",
    "note that following remark  [ rem3 ] , unlike the classical coloring problems , this property is not straightforward for the improper twin edge coloring problem .",
    "the characterization of graphs having @xmath87 emphasizes the closely related problem of deciding whether all color classes are of odd size in all optimal colorings . in section [ sec : complexity ] , we use this new problem to show that , interestingly enough , just like in the case of usual edge chromatic index which can only take two possible values , it is np - complete to decide whether @xmath88 even when the graph @xmath0 is restricted to have @xmath32 equal to its maximum clique size and in the bounded degree case",
    ". finally , in section [ sec : poly ] , we give first examples of graph classes for which this question can be decided in polynomial time .",
