    "semiconductor spintronic devices are poised to complement existing electronic devices in the future by using the electron s spin degree of freedom to store and transfer information.@xcite of the many branches and uses of spintronics , spin relaxation is relevant to each .",
    "the rate of decay of spin polarization needs to be taken into consideration in spin packet transportation , spin transistor junctions , spin qubits , and the like .",
    "additionally , microscopic studies of spin relaxation severely test our ability quantitatively describe effective interactions and scattering mechanisms in the solid state.@xcite    the most complete study of spin relaxation in semiconductors to date is by jiang _ et al._,@xcite who made calculations of the spin relaxation time ( srt ) due to each of the relevant spin relaxation mechanisms in iii - v semiconductors : bir - aronov - pikus ( bap ) @xcite , dyakonov - perel ( dp)@xcite , and elliott - yafet ( ey)@xcite . comparing the relative efficiencies of the mechanisms , their results suggest that dyakonov - perel spin relaxation is dominant for essentially all the electron densities and temperatures of experimental interest.@xcite although teng _",
    "et al . _ initially found cases where bap spin relaxation dominates dp spin relaxation in intrinsic gaas,@xcite it was later pointed out by jiang and wu that non - degenerate statistics were being applied to degenerate electrons.@xcite also noted by jiang _",
    ", song and kim have investigated spin relaxation due to all of the relevant spin relaxation mechanisms in @xmath0- and @xmath1-type iii - v semiconductors,@xcite but their analytical expressions are again only applicable to the non - degenerate regime .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have calculated ey srts due to electron - impurity and electron - electron collisions in @xmath0-doped gaas for a wide range of temperatures and electron densities , finding that the ey mechanism alone is insufficient to explain experimental srt measurements,@xcite suggesting that dp spin relaxation may account for the discrepancies .",
    "these findings encourage us to continue looking at dp spin relaxation as the primary spin relaxation mechanism in gaas and similar semiconductors of the zincblende structure .",
    "the focus of the present study is on the role played by many - body interactions on the dp spin relaxation mechanism  a role that we would like to clearly disentangle from that of other scattering mechanisms .",
    "the theory of many - body effects in dp spin relaxation for electrons in semiconductors was formulated by glazov and ivchenko ( gi ) several years ago.@xcite the basic idea is that electron - electron scattering causes the electron quasiparticle to perform a random walk in momentum space ; this in turn causes random variations of the direction and magnitude of the spin precession axis .",
    "dp spin relaxation arises from the cumulative effect of many small precessions about randomly varying axes , and its main signature is that the spin relaxation rate is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering rate . in practice",
    ", however , it is very difficult to disentangle the contribution of the electron - electron scattering rate from the similar but much larger contribution of electron - impurity scattering , which is inevitably present in doped semiconductors .",
    "an important exception arises in intrinsic semiconductors , when a non - equilibrium population of electrons _ and holes _ can be created by optical excitation . by using circularly polarized light it is possible to achieve a high degree of spin polarization of the electrons in the conduction band ( the spins of the holes relax rapidly due to strong spin - orbit interactions in the valence band ) , and",
    "the time evolution of this spin polarization can be monitored in real time .",
    "such a system is virtually impurity free , and thus offers a unique opportunity to directly test the impact of many - body interactions on dp spin relaxation of electrons .    the initial motivation for the present study came from an experiment in which a density - dependent diffusion rate for spin polarized electrons was observed in a photo - excited electron - hole packet in bulk gaas.@xcite zhao _",
    "_ found that the spin density in such a packet has a smaller diffusion constant than the carrier density .",
    "it was argued that this could be explained by a density dependent spin relaxation rate , where the electron spins in low density regions of the packet relax faster than in the high density regions , leading to the _ appearance _ of slow diffusion .",
    "this behavior is consistent with that of dp spin relaxation controlled by electron - electron scattering in the non - degenerate regime,@xcite which is indeed expected to occur in the low density regions of the electron - hole packet .",
    "remarkably , the _ increase _ of the spin - relaxation rate with decreasing density in the non - degenerate regime is opposite to the behavior in the degenerate regime,@xcite where the spin relaxation rate _ decreases _ with decreasing density .",
    "this means that the srt has a maximum as a function of density at a density intermediate between the degenerate and the non - degenerate regime .",
    "the present paper continues our efforts to develop a better microscopic understanding of the gi mechanism of dp spin relaxation .",
    "we consider electron - electron , electron - impurity , and electron - hole interactions in the degenerate regime . in this regime",
    ", the presence of a large fermi surface paves the way to an elegant analytical treatment of electron - electron and electron - hole scattering rates  a treatment pioneered by abrikosov and khalatnikov in their classic paper on the theory of the fermi liquid .",
    "the relevant scattering rates are similar to but not identical with the well - known momentum scattering rates which control , for example , the lifetime of quasiparticles .",
    "the difference arises because different collision events are not equally effective at changing the magnitude and direction of the spin precession : the contribution of different collision events must be weighted according to their effectiveness at changing the spin precession .",
    "( a similar  weighting \"  this time concerning the effectiveness of collisions at changing the current  is responsible for the replacement of the scattering cross section by the  transport cross section \" in microscopic calculations of the electrical conductivity ) .",
    "gi had previously looked at the contribution of electron - electron collisions to dp spin relaxation in the degenerate regime , but limited themselves to qualitative estimates.@xcite jiang , _ et al .",
    "_ applied the powerful kinetic spin bloch equation approach , including all relevant spin relaxation mechanisms , but their work was primarily numerical.@xcite in the present paper , analytic expressions are derived which are applicable to a variety of semiconductors of the zincblende structure ; in particular , the calculation of the relevant electron - electron and electron - hole scattering rates is reduced to the evaluation of simple two - dimensional and one - dimensional integrals over the fermi surface .",
    "we find that electron - hole scattering is the dominant mechanism of momentum randomization in these intrinsic semiconductors .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that our mechanism of spin relaxation remains conceptually distinct from the bap mechanism in which electrons transfer their spin polarization to the holes via interband matrix elements of the coulomb interaction . in the present mechanism ",
    "that is in the dp mechanism ",
    "electrons transfer only momentum to the holes .",
    "another novel feature of the present work is that we include exchange and correlation effects in the calculation of the effective electron - electron and electron - hole interactions . in practice",
    ", this means that we are going beyond the basic rpa - screened interaction .",
    "exchange and correlation effects are included via local field factors , and we will show that these effects cause an enhancement of the scattering rate  and a corresponding reduction of spin relaxation rate  at low density and low temperature ( still in the degenerate regime ) . in the opposite limit of high density , the scattering lifetime becomes very large . a cautionary note is included for the treatment of dp spin relaxation in this regime .",
    "specifically , the common assumption that momentum - changing collisions are frequent on the scale of spin relaxation fails , since the two processes occur on comparable time scales . in this regime",
    "the quasiparticles are essentially non - interacting and the dp mechanism is superseded by the spin precession of individual quasiparticles of essentially constant momentum .    this paper is organized as follows : in section [ srt_review ] , we review the steps and the assumptions in the derivation of the standard formula for dyakonov - perel spin relaxation ; in section [ eff_scat ] we derive analytic expressions for the effective ( i.e. weighted ) scattering rates due to electron collisions with electrons , holes and impurities ; section [ scat ] describes the effective scattering amplitudes used in our calculations ; section [ disc ] discusses the effective scattering rates and srts for doped and intrinsic gaas ; section [ conc ] contains our concluding remarks .",
    "although the derivation of dp spin relaxation is well known and can be found in excellent reviews @xcite we briefly reproduce it here , partly to adapt the notations , and partly to spell out the underlying physical assumptions .",
    "the system under investigation is a iii - v semiconductor ( i.e. gaas , inas , insb ) of the zibcblende structure , which exhibits spin - split bands .",
    "the spin splitting is caused by a dresselhaus effective magnetic field@xcite which arises from spin - orbit interaction and couples to electrons via the hamiltonian term @xmath2 where @xmath3 defines the precession axis and precession frequency of electron spins .",

    "let us now introduce the form of the quasi - equilibrium distribution , @xmath21 , from which we may use the relations above to find expressions for @xmath23 and the spin polarization .",
    "@xmath21 is written in terms of equilibrium fermi - dirac distributions for spin - up electrons ( @xmath39 ) and spin - down electrons ( @xmath40 ) in the presence of a fictitious @xmath41-dependent magnetic field which we introduce to enforce the desired quasi - equilibrium spin polarization : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath16 identity matrix , @xmath44 is the spin - averaged occupation number of the @xmath4 state and @xmath45 is the quasi - equilibrium spin polarization occupation number of the @xmath4 state .",

    ", we can see that when the scattering lifetime is of the same order of magnitude as the spin - relaxation time , our treatment is no longer justified .",
    "if spins relax just as quickly as collisions occur , it makes no sense to introduce a quasi - equilibrium distribution function . in the extreme limit of infrequent collisions ,",

    "<S> we present an analytical study of the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation time for degenerate electrons in a photo - excited electron - hole liquid in intrinsic semiconductors exhibiting a spin - split band structure . </S>",
    "<S> the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation of electrons in these materials is controlled by electron - hole scattering , with small corrections from electron - electron scattering and virtually none from electron - impurity scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we derive simple expressions ( one - dimensional and two - dimensional integrals respectively ) for the effective electron - hole and electron - electron scattering rates which enter the spin relaxation time calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - hole scattering rate is found to be comparable to the scattering rates from impurities in the electron liquid  a common model for @xmath0-type doped semiconductors . as the density of electron - hole pairs decreases ( within the degenerate regime ) , a strong enhancement of the scattering rates and a corresponding slowing down of spin relaxation is predicted due to exchange and correlation effects in the electron - hole liquid . in the opposite limit of high density , the original dyakonov - perel model fails due to decreasing scattering rates and is eventually superseded by free precession of individual quasiparticle spins . </S>"
