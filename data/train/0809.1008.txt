    "a pivotal feature in the study of spatially homogeneous cosmologies is the fact that the ( asymptotic ) dynamics of cosmological solutions of the einstein equations is largely determined by the spatial geometry of the initial spacelike hypersurface .",
    "this is reflected in the systematics of the bianchi classification of spatially homogeneous cosmologies .",
    "in contrast , a systematic analysis of the influence of the matter model on the ( asymptotic ) dynamics of solutions is not available at present .",
    "it is known that the dynamics of solutions ( and the asymptotics towards the initial singularity , in particular ) strongly depends on the matter source that is considered ; the relatively simple behaviour of the vacuum and the perfect fluid case , see , e.g. ,  @xcite , is replaced by a considerably more intricate behaviour in the case of anisotropic matter models  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze systematically and in detail in which way anisotropies of the matter source determine the dynamics of cosmological solutions .    in our analysis",
    "we consider spatially homogeneous solutions of bianchi type  i. the reason for this choice is that bianchi type  i is the ` foundation ' of the bianchi classification .",
    "generally , the dynamics of the ` higher ' types in the bianchi classification is based on the dynamics of the ` lower ' types ; for instance , the asymptotics of solutions of bianchi types  viii and  ix can only be understood in terms of solutions of bianchi type  i and  ii , see  @xcite for an up - to - date discussion .",
    "likewise , our understanding of cosmological models in general is conjectured to be built on the dynamics of spatially homogeneous models and thus on the dynamics of bianchi type  i models in particular , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the dynamics of bianchi type  i cosmological models where the matter is a perfect fluid is well - known  @xcite . in this context , it is customary to assume that the the perfect fluid is represented by an energy density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 that obey a linear equation of state @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "each bianchi type  i perfect fluid solution isotropizes for late times ; this means that each solution approaches a ( flat ) friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) solution for late times . towards the initial singularity ,",
    "each solution approaches a kasner solution ( bianchi type  i vacuum solution ) , i.e. , to leading order in the limit @xmath5 the metric is described by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are positive constants , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the kasner exponents , which are constants that satisfy @xmath13 .",
    "conversely ( and importantly ) , for each kasner solution ( including the taub solution , for which @xmath14 and permutations ) there exists a bianchi type  i perfect fluid model that converges to this solution as @xmath5 ; in other words , each kasner solution is a possible past asymptotic state .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with bianchi type  i cosmological models with _",
    "anisotropic matter_. we do not specify the matter model explicitly ; on the contrary , the assumptions that we impose on the matter source are so mild that we can treat several matter models at the same time , examples being matter models as different from each other as collisionless matter , elastic matter ( for a wide variety of constitutive equations ) and magnetic fields ( aligned along one of the axes ) .",
    "the main results we derive are presented as theorems  [ futurethm][pastthm2 ] in section  [ global ] and summarized in figure  [ final ] , but let us give a rough non - technical overview :    first consider the asymptotic behaviour of models towards the future .",
    "for ` conventional ' matter sources  where ` conventional ' means that the isotropic state of these anisotropic matter models is energetically favorable  we find that each associated bianchi type  i solution isotropizes towards the future , i.e. , each solution approaches a frw solution for late times . however , there also exist matter models whose isotropic state is unstable . in this case ,",
    "the future asymptotic behaviour is completely different ; isotropization occurs but it is non - generic ; generically , solutions approach different self - similar solutions , e.g. , there exist solutions that approach kasner solutions as @xmath15 . it should be emphasized that these models are often compatible with the energy conditions .",
    "second consider the asymptotic behaviour towards the singularity .",
    "we observe a rather diverse asymptotic behaviour , but the past dynamics of _ generic _ bianchi type  i solutions is again intimately connected with the kasner states .",
    "interestingly enough , the details of the past asymptotic dynamics of solutions are governed by one particular parameter , @xmath16 , that describes certain ` asymptotic properties ' of the matter ( the properties of the matter under extreme conditions  extreme stress , etc.that are found close to the spacetime singularity ) ; this parameter can also be regarded as a measure for the degree of ( dominant ) energy condition violation under extreme conditions .",
    "( clearly , we always assume that the dominant energy condition is satisfied under ` normal conditions ' of the matter . )",
    "if the matter satisfies the dominant energy condition also under extreme conditions , then each bianchi type  i solution approaches a kasner solution , and conversely , each kasner solution is a possible past asymptotic state ; the kasner solutions are on an equal footing in this respect .",
    "( the case where the energy condition is satisfied only marginally is slightly different ; the taub solutions play a special role in that case . )",
    "if the dominant energy condition is violated under extreme conditions , this result breaks down ; however , we must distinguish between ` under - critical ' violations of the energy condition ( corresponding to a small value of @xmath16 ) and ` over - critical ' violations ( corresponding to a large value of @xmath16 ) .",
    "for an under - critical violation of the energy condition , each bianchi type  i solution approaches a kasner state , but the converse is false , i.e. , there exist kasner solutions that are excluded as possible past asymptotic states . only kasner solutions that are ` sufficiently different ' from the taub solution , i.e. , only kasner solutions with @xmath17 sufficiently different from @xmath18 and permutations , are attractors for bianchi type  i solutions .",
    "the set of potential asymptotic states is smaller if the degree of the energy condition violation is larger . finally , for an over - critical violation of the energy condition ,",
    "bianchi type  i solutions with anisotropic matter do not converge to a kasner state as @xmath5 , but they follow a sequence of kasner states ( ` epochs ' ) , in each of which their behaviour is approximately described by a kasner solution .",
    "this is a type of behaviour that resembles the mixmaster oscillatory behaviour that is expected for bianchi type  viii and  ix ( vacuum ) cosmologies ( and generic cosmological models ) ; note , however , that both the details and the origin of these oscillations are very different  in the present case , the oscillatory behaviour is not related to the mixmaster map ; it is a consequence of ( over - critical ) energy condition violation ; in the mixmaster case , the reason is the geometry of the problem .",
    "independently of the energy conditions , there also exist a variety of bianchi type  i solutions with anisotropic matter that exhibit a past asymptotic behaviour that is not connected with kasner asymptotics ; however , these are non - generic solutions ; we prove that there exist essentially three different types of non - generic asymptotics .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we discuss the einstein equations in bianchi type  i symmetry and introduce our main assumption on the anisotropic matter model : the stress - energy tensor is assumed to be represented by a function of the metric and the initial data of the matter source .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the study of diagonal models , i.e. , solutions for which the metric is diagonal in the standard coordinates of bianchi type  i symmetric spacetimes . in section  [ dynamicalsection ]",
    "we rewrite the einstein equations in terms of new variables and show that the essential dynamics is described by a system of autonomous differential equations on a four dimensional compact state space  the _ reduced dynamical system_. section  [ boundaries ] is by far the longest and most technical part of the paper .",
    "it contains a detailed analysis of the flow induced by the reduced dynamical system on the boundary of the state space . in section  [ local ]",
    "we study the local stability properties of the fixed points of the reduced dynamical system .",
    "finally , in section  [ global ] we present the main results : theorems  [ futurethm][pastthm2 ] and figure  [ final ] . the proofs",
    "are based on the results of sections  [ boundaries ] and  [ local ] and make use of techniques from the theory of dynamical systems . the purpose of section  [ mattermodels ] is to bring to life the general assumptions on the matter source that are made in sections  [ setup][local ] .",
    "we give three important examples of matter models to which our analysis applies straightforwardly : collisionless ( vlasov ) matter , elastic matter and magnetic fields .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusions ] contains some concluding remarks together with an outlook of possible developments of the present work .",
    "we consider a spatially homogeneous spacetime of bianchi type  i. the spacetime metric can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the induced riemannian metric on the spatially homogeneous surfaces @xmath21 . by @xmath22",

    "the evolution equations are    [ einstein ] @xmath28 the hamiltonian constraint reads @xmath29    and the momentum constraint is @xmath30 ( which is due to the fact that bianchi i spacetimes are spatially flat ) .",
    "the latter does not impose any restriction on the gravitational degrees of freedom , which are represented by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but only on the matter fields .",
    "in general , the system   must be complemented by equations describing the evolution of the matter fields .    for certain matter models ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor takes the form of an explicit functional of the metric @xmath31 .",
    "let us give some examples .",
    "for a ( non - tilted ) perfect fluid , the energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath33 , where the energy density @xmath1 and the pressure @xmath2 are connected via a barotropic equation of state @xmath34 .",
    "when we define @xmath35 as @xmath36 , the einstein equations   imply @xmath37 ( which is a special case of equation   below ) .",
    "hence @xmath1 is obtained as a function @xmath38 . clearly , prescribing @xmath1 as a function of @xmath35 is equivalent to prescribing an equation of state for the fluid ( modulo a scaling constant ) .",
    "likewise , for collisionless matter the components of the energy - momentum tensor are given as functions of the metric @xmath20 , which depend on the initial data for the matter ( which is described by the distribution function of particles in phase space ; see section  [ mattermodels ] for details ) .",
    "we thereby obtain the energy density @xmath1 and the principal pressures @xmath39 ( which are defined as the eigenvalues of @xmath40 ) as @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "finally , for elastic matter the constitutive equation of state of the material determines @xmath1 and @xmath39 as functions of @xmath20 ; for details we refer again to section  [ mattermodels ] .",
    "motivated by these examples we make our fundamental assumption on the matter model .    [ assumptiont ] the components of the energy - momentum tensor are represented by smooth ( at least @xmath43 ) functions of the metric @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that @xmath44 is positive ( as long as @xmath31 is non - degenerate ) .",
    "we note that the particular form of the functions that represent the components of the energy - momentum tensor may depend on a number of external parameters or external functions that describe the properties of the matter , and/or the initial data of the matter field(s ) ; see section  [ mattermodels ] and  @xcite for examples .    by assumption  [ assumptiont ] ,",
    "the evolution equations of the matter fields in bianchi type  i are contained in the einstein evolution equations   via the contracted bianchi identity .",
    "the regularity of @xmath40 as a function of the spatial metric ensures that the cauchy problem for the evolution equations with initial data at @xmath45 is locally well - posed on a time interval @xmath46 , @xmath47 . the requirement @xmath48 and",

    "the limit @xmath5 corresponds to a curvature singularity .",

    "in this way , our analysis applies to a wide variety of anisotropic matter models including matter models as different from each other as collisionless matter , elastic materials and magnetic fields .    a basic assumption on the matter model was to require that the isotropic pressure @xmath2 and the density @xmath1 obey a linear equation of state @xmath3 , where @xmath885 , see assumption  [ assumptionwi ] .",

    "the dynamical system on each of these boundary subsets coincides with the system   that we have discussed so extensively in this paper . since the variable @xmath471 is strictly monotone , the asymptotic dynamics of solutions of the dynamical system",
    "is associated with the limits @xmath481 and @xmath898 .",
    "accordingly , asymptotically , the flow of the boundary subsets @xmath901 and @xmath902 ( and thus the results of the present paper ) constitute the key to an understanding of the dynamics of the more general problem with nonlinear equations of state .",
    "it is conceivable that several of our assumptions can be relaxed ( however , physics might disapprove ) , which could lead to interesting extensions of the results of this paper .",
    "for instance , if assumption  [ f ] is removed , then there exist several isotropic states of the matter and thus there might exist bianchi type  i solutions that isotropize both toward the past and toward the future .",
    "assumption  [ assumptiont ] , on the other hand , could be replaced by the condition that the energy - momentum tensor depends not only on the spatial metric but also on the second fundamental form . in this way it is possible to extend the analysis to even larger classes of matter fields",
