    "quantum entanglement has received considerable attention in the field of quantum information science since it can be employed as a resource to perform tasks in quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation and even quantum computation @xcite . although entanglement is responsible for many quantum processes , it is fragile due to the inevitable interaction between a system and its environment , which makes it difficult to be used in quantum techniques @xcite . in the past few years ,",
    "another measure of quantum correlations , quantum discord @xcite , has been studied extensively @xcite , which quantifies nonclassical correlations in a quantum system including those not captured by entanglement .",
    "non - zero quantum discord in separable mixed states can even be a resource for computational speedup and quantum enhancement @xcite . in view of these potential technique applications ,",
    "the detection and quantification of quantum correlations become vital in the experimental context . up to now , various criteria and solutions to this problem have been proposed , such as bell inequalities @xcite , entanglement witnesses @xcite , measurement of nonlinear properties of a quantum state @xcite . the experimental technique used in photon systems @xcite",
    "was thought to be promising .",
    "however , it has been found that the method is limited by the count rates , which makes it incapable of detecting some entangled states generated in the laboratory .",
    "besides , environmental noise is also a significant disturbance in detecting weakly entangled states .    on the other hand , an oxavanadium phosphate compound ,",
    "vohpo@xmath0h@xmath1o has attracted intense interests from the experimental chemical community , as well known to be a precursor of industrial catalysts for oxidizing _",
    "n_-butane to maleic anhydride @xcite . besides",

    "several magnetic models have been proposed in the literatures , e.g. , the isolated dimer model and the alternating chain model with debatable magnetic interaction scheme and spin exchange coupling strength @xcite .",
    "the local spin-@xmath6 structure implies that this material can be a promising carrier of quantum bits in quantum information processing and its quantumness deserves an overall examination . in this paper",
    ", we study carefully the quantum correlations in the spin dimer material vodpo@xmath0d@xmath1o , based on the experimental data of its magnetic excitations by using inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite .",
    "we show that quantum entanglement remains in this material at relatively high temperature @xmath782.5 k , which is much higher than that of the previously reported cn [ cu(no@xmath8)@xmath12.5d@xmath1o ] ( about 5 k ) @xcite . on the other hand , for quantum discord",
    ", the critical temperature can be even higher than 300 k , indicating that discord can be used as a resource for room temperature quantum devices .",
    "it is clear that this peculiarity has a great practical implication for quantum information processing .",

    "section ii describes the magnetic model for vodpo@xmath0d@xmath1o and briefly introduces the method to calculate quantum correlations .",
    "section iii is devoted to the relationship between quantum correlations and the inelastic neutron scattering experimental data .",
    "we also analyse the behavior of quantum correlations under the influences of temperature @xmath9 and the spin - orbit interaction , respectively .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "the nearest - neighbor heisenberg magnet can be modelled by @xcite @xmath10 where the sum runs over nearest - neighbor pairs , the exchange coupling constants @xmath11 are positive for antiferromagnetic and negative for ferromagnetic interactions , and @xmath12 is the quantum spin operator for a spin-1/2 ion at site @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest spin cluster model is the spin dimer shown in figure 1 , which consists of isolated pair of magnetic ions described by the two - spin heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "vohpo@xmath0h@xmath1o has been well described by this spin dimer model , as reported in refs .",

    "its density matrix in thermal equilibrium is given by @xcite    @xmath15    with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the sum of correlations of three orthogonal directions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the isotropy of heisenberg interaction in spin space results in @xmath22 . here",
    ", the spin - spin correlation function @xmath23 can be employed as an entanglement witness , because for any product state of a pair of spins the correlation satisfies @xcite @xmath24 this bound , acting as a quantum - classical boundary in solid - state physics , is thus an entangle - separable boundary .",
    "the upper bound is given by the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath25 .",
    "nonlocality is another aspect of quantum correlations , and can be indicated by a measure of violation of bell inequalities , such as the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath13=1,2 ) denote the operators corresponding to measurements on site @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "for magnetically ordered solids , the inelastic neutron scattering is particularly informative . in a magnetically coupled dimer ,",
    "the total spin @xmath43 is a good quantum number and we can expect a dispersionless single excitation from the @xmath44 singlet to the excited level ( @xmath45 triplet at @xmath46 ) , which can be observed by inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "in such an experiment , the scattered neutrons are analyzed according to the energy transfer @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the neutron mass , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the wave numbers of initial and final neutrons , respectively .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath51 should be satisfied , where @xmath52 is the scattering vector . assuming that both ground singlet and triplet states can be described by state vectors like @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the total spin quantum number of the coupled system , the thermal neutron cross section of a transition @xmath56 can be written as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the partition function , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 the neutron magnetic moment , @xmath61 the classical electron radius , @xmath62 the magnetic ion form factor , @xmath63 the debye - waller factor , and @xmath64 the position vector of the @xmath65th v ion in the molecule . @xmath66 and @xmath67 represent the state vectors of the initial and final electronic levels with energies @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath70 function may be replaced by a gaussian line shape , due to line broadening , resulting from the relaxation effects and instrumental resolution .    by performing a powder average over the general cross section formula ( 10 ) in @xmath52 space ,",

    "next we describe the main experimental results of ref .",
    "the vodpo@xmath0d@xmath1o has an orthorhombic crystal structure with space group @xmath76 at @xmath77 k , and with lattice parameters @xmath78  , @xmath79  , and @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "it is synthesized from v@xmath1o@xmath81 , d@xmath8po@xmath82 , and d@xmath1o , and the deuteration is necessary for performing the experiment , since one is interested in the magnetic ins and therefore the nonmagnetic scattering should be minimized by eliminating the h atoms .",
    "in addition , the deuteration has no measurable effect on the physical quantity . in the experiment the neutron scattering intensity is measured in the temperature range @xmath83 k as a function of energy transfer @xmath84 and wave vector transfer @xmath71 . by using the method of least - squares to fit a gaussian profile with a linearly sloping background , the peak center is extracted at @xmath85 mev , and the next - nearest - neighbor pathway ( v - o - p - o - v shown in figure 2 ) has a v - v separation @xmath86  .",
    "this value is close to 7.6 mev obtained from the measurement of magnetic susceptibility of vohpo@xmath0h@xmath1o @xcite , which satisfies the bleaney - bowers formula well with the land factor @xmath87 .",

    "[ fig2],width=302 ]    figure 3 displays the entanglement witness , concurrence , and quantum discord as a function of temperature in vodpo@xmath0d@xmath1o .",
    "as expected , the correlations decrease with temperature .",
    "it is shown that at low temperature ( @xmath89 k ) , both concurrence and quantum discord remain maximal ( @xmath901 ) and are not affected by temperature , which is associated with the existence of a gap in the energy spectrum of the system . in the region",
    "@xmath91 k , concurrence is always greater than the quantum discord , which implies that the quantum discord is not a sum of entanglement and some other nonclassical correlations . in the region",
    "@xmath92 k , quantum discord decays gradually with temperature , but is still non - vanishing at room temperature .",
    "therefore , it has a significant advantage over quantum entanglement , since the latter decreases quickly and disappears at about @xmath93 k where the entanglement witness @xmath94 falls to 0.25 .",
    "the critical temperature , where entanglement drops to zero , @xmath95 k is much higher than 5 k in the copper nitrate cn[cu(no@xmath8)@xmath12.5d@xmath1o ] @xcite .",
    "similarly , at temperature below @xmath96 k , the chsh operator @xmath97 is higher than the local realistic limit , implying the quantum nonlocality .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is no monotonous relation between the bell violation and quantum correlations .",
    "this means that an entangled state is not necessary a nonlocal state @xcite .",
    "the two open circles , marked for eye - catching , indicate the values of quantum discord derived at temperatures of 10 k and 50 k , respectively . [ fig3],width=302 ]    the spin - orbit interaction @xmath98 is crucial to the description of many antiferromagnetic systems such as cu(c@xmath99d@xmath81coo)@xmath1003d@xmath1o , k@xmath1v@xmath8o@xmath101 , and yb@xmath82as@xmath8 , where @xmath102 is known as the dzyaloshinski - moriya vector @xcite and here we take @xmath103 . by turning on the so interaction , it is shown in figure 4 that quantum entanglement and the critical temperature @xmath5 can greatly rise if the parameter @xmath104 is increased , i.e. , larger entanglement can exist at moderately high temperature .",
    "this indicates that vodpo@xmath0d@xmath1o is superior to many other candidates for quantum information process in solid - state systems , where quantum correlations are required at high temperature ( @xmath105 k ) .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the so interaction does not make a significant contribution to the quantum correlations for a family of hamiltonians subject to the transformation @xcite @xmath106}},\\ ] ] such that @xmath107 , where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 are independent angles , and the isotropic xy model with @xmath111 is a good physical example @xcite .",
    "d@xmath1o as a function of @xmath9 for different so interactions , with @xmath112 mev .",
    "[ fig4],width=302 ]",
    "we analyze inelastic neutron scattering experiments and find the presence of macroscopic quantum correlations , quantified by entanglement and quantum discord , in the solid - state system vodpo@xmath0d@xmath1o .",
    "our study demonstrates that quantum correlations may play a broad generic role in the macroscopic world , and this low - dimensional magnetic material may be employed for quantum information processing , since that all quantum correlations remain approximately 1 at @xmath77 k , and the critical temperature for entanglement death is as high as @xmath3 k , in contrast to the materials with nuclear spins @xcite , where entanglement can arise only at tenths of a microkelvin . on the other hand , quantum discord , another measure of non - classical correlations , can exist even at room temperature , enabling it a more effective resource for implementing quantum information processing .",
    "by introducing the spin - orbit interaction , we can even increase the critical temperature @xmath5 significantly .",
    "this feature is remarkable , implying that vodpo@xmath0d@xmath1o may have practical implications for the study of fundamental issues of quantum mechanics and present promising applications in quantum technologies such as quantum computers .",
