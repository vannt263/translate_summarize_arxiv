    "we consider quantum representations of the mapping class group of the @xmath0-punctured sphere arising from witten - reshetikhin - turaev @xmath1-topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) .",
    "the motivation of this work is the amu conjecture stated by andersen , masbaum and ueno ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this conjecture relates quantum representations to the nielsen - thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms .",
    "this is part of a more general question which is to know what kind of geometric information can be extracted from quantum representations . at the moment , results concerning the amu conjecture are only known in genus zero and one ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we give a new method to study the amu conjecture and we use it to prove the conjecture in some new cases .    for @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 a @xmath10-th primitive root of unity we denote by @xmath11 the skein module , evaluated at @xmath9 , of the @xmath12-ball whose boundary is equipped with @xmath0 banded points all colored by @xmath13 .",
    "the mapping class group of the @xmath0-punctured sphere ( denoted by @xmath14 ) acts projectively on @xmath11 .",
    "the quantum representation is defined on the space @xmath15 ( we use the notations of @xcite , it corresponds to the @xmath1-tqft at level @xmath16 in the construction of tqft via geometric quantization or conformal field theory ) . in the construction of blanchet , habegger , masbaum and vogel ,",
    "the action of @xmath14 on the space @xmath11 is the starting point of the construction of the quantum representation of @xmath14 on @xmath15 . to describe this space we recall the following definition    let @xmath17 be the left kernel of the natural sesquilinear form on the space @xmath11 defined by the kauffman bracket .",
    "it follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop 1.9 ) that the space @xmath17 is stable for the action of @xmath14 . and the quantum representation is defined by @xmath18    for @xmath19 the space @xmath17 is simply zero .",
    "but for @xmath20 this space is not trivial and is actually the part in the skein module which is usually neglected in the tqft . throughout this paper",
    "we will call this space the _ kernel space_. our major concern is to see what kind of asymptotic tqft - like information we can extract from these kernel spaces .",
    "surprisingly , these objects which come from quantum topology are connected to geometric representations studied for a long time .",
    "more precisely the projective representation induced on @xmath17 in the case @xmath21 is exactly the same as the one induced on a space @xmath22 ( depending on a root of unity @xmath23 ) considered by mcmullen in @xcite which is a subspace of the first cohomology space of a surface @xmath24 which is a cyclic branched covering of the sphere .",
    "here is our main theorem :    [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ] when @xmath25 and @xmath9 is a @xmath10-th primitive root of unity , if we set @xmath26 , then @xmath27 as projective representations of @xmath14",
    ".    at this point we need to make some remarks .",
    "first the representations of @xmath14 on @xmath22 are closely related to the burau representations ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.5 ) and remark [ remark mc ] ) and the surface @xmath24 is always a cyclic branched @xmath6-covering of the sphere in theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ] .    in the case @xmath28 and @xmath29 the action of @xmath14 on the skein module @xmath30 has already been studied ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . loosely speaking the representations",
    "were interpreted using an algebraic operation in the homology of a cyclic branched @xmath31-covering of the sphere .",
    "this homological space is nothing but @xmath32 in the setting of @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath33 and @xmath34 is actually an extreme case where the kernel space is so big that it is the entire skein module . in our setting , this only happens when @xmath35 and @xmath28 , where the cyclic branched covering of the sphere we consider is simply the torus and the cover is given by quotienting by a hyperelliptic involution .",
    "therefore , if we set @xmath28 and @xmath35 in theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ] , we recover the result shown in @xcite .    for @xmath36 , theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ]",
    "generalises the results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which only concern the case @xmath28 . for the proof of theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ]",
    ", we have to distinguish ( see remark [ r1 ] ) the case @xmath35 ( see section [ proof_n_4 ] ) and the case @xmath5 ( see section [ proof_n_6 ] ) .",
    "the proof for @xmath35 relies on a recursive formula for jones - wenzl idempotents proved by frenkel and khovanov ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theor  3.5 ) ) and independently proved by morrison ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally we recall that lawrence ( see @xcite , @xcite ) gave an cohomological interpretation of the quantum representation of the braid group @xmath37 . briefly speaking",
    ", it involves the action of @xmath37 on a certain cohomological space ( with local coefficients ) associated to the configuration space of @xmath0 points on the @xmath31-disc . in the same direction",
    ", we also refer to the work done by bigelow ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we do nt know how to prove theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ] using these cohomological approaches",
    ". it would be interesting to understand theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ] in these settings .",
    "+ as an application of our main theorem we give new cases where the amu conjecture can be proved . in the case @xmath35 we prove that the amu conjecture holds for @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath28 was already proved in @xmath38 .",
    "the precise statement is as follows :    [ cor1_c3 ] for all @xmath2 , if @xmath39 is pseudo - anosov then there exists @xmath40 ( depending on @xmath13 and @xmath41 ) such that for all @xmath42 , @xmath41 has infinite order when acting on @xmath43    for the case @xmath5 , theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ] is not enough to prove the amu conjecture for all pseudo - anosov elements .",
    "however , we prove that the amu conjecture holds for pseudo - anosov with non trivial stretching factors when acting on the cohomological spaces @xmath22 . more precisely ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath44 the projective representation defined in @xcite , for any element @xmath45 , the operator @xmath46 is defined up to a phase factor which is a root of unity .",
    "therefore it makes sense to say that @xmath47 has a spectral radius strictly greater than one .",
    "we prove the following    [ cor1.2_c3 ] let @xmath2 and let @xmath7 be even .",
    "let @xmath45 be pseudo - anosov .",
    "suppose that there exists @xmath23 a @xmath6-th primitive root of unity such that the operator @xmath48 acting on the space @xmath49 has a spectral radius strictly greater than one .",
    "then there exists @xmath40 ( depending on @xmath13 , @xmath0 and @xmath41 ) such that for all @xmath42 , @xmath50 has infinite order when acting on @xmath51 .",
    "corollary [ cor1_c3 ] and [ cor1.2_c3 ] are deduced directly from theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ] using a limit argument .",
    "the strategy is to notice that the action of @xmath14 on @xmath15 admits a limit as @xmath52 and as @xmath9 tends to a specific root of unity . in general",
    "the limit representation is not arising from tqft .",
    "the action of @xmath14 on a kernel space may appear as subrepresentation of this limit .",
    "moreover , a geometric interpretation of such a kernel space gives results concerning the amu conjecture .",
    "with hindsight , the proofs of known cases of the amu conjecture in @xcite and @xcite can also be phrased in terms of kernel spaces .",
    "the difference is that in @xcite and @xcite , the entire limit representation is a kernel space in our sense , while in the present paper only a subspace of the limit representation is a kernel space .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we prove that @xmath53 ( see theorem [ cor3_c3 ] ) and in subsection [ action_mcg ] we recall the definition of the action of @xmath14 on a certain basis of @xmath11 . in section 3 , we briefly recall the definition of the representations considered by mcmullen in @xcite and we derive explicit formulas ( see section [ explicit formulas ] ) which we summarize in conclusion 1 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the proof of theorem [ main_theorem_punctured_spheres ] in the case @xmath5 .",
    "this proof is done by giving explicit formulas for the actions of the canonical generators of @xmath14 on @xmath54 and comparing it with the formulas of conclusion 1 .",
    "section 5 deals with the case @xmath35 .",
    "this case has to be handled separately ( see remark [ r1 ] ) and the basis of @xmath55 we construct uses a recursive formula for jones - wenzl idempotents proved by frenkel and khovanov in @xcite and independently by morrison in @xcite . section 5 ends with the proof of corollary [ cor1_c3 ] and corollary [ cor1.2_c3 ] .",
    "finally in section 6 , we give examples ( using experimental computations ) where corollary [ cor1.2_c3 ] may be applied .",
