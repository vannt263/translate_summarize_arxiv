    "cold , fast - moving molecular clumps have been detected at distances up to a few kpc from the central engines of a few dozen active galactic nucleii ( agn ) , mostly highly - obscured agn in dusty star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "in the nearby qso markarian 231 , for example , a @xmath4 yr@xmath5 kpc - scale outflow with a radial velocity of @xmath6 has been well detected by several groups @xcite .",
    "similarly , surveys of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and quasar - hosts suggest that the presence of an agn can boost molecular outflow rates by large factors @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the origin of these molecular clumps is unclear .",
    "one possibility , in analogy with the prevalent picture for starburst driven winds , is that the clouds are driven out of the host galaxy by ram pressure acceleration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however this hypothesis runs into serious difficulties , both because : ( i ) shocks and conduction from the exterior medium tend to compress the clouds perpendicular to the direction of the flow , greatly reducing the momentum flux they receive ; and ( ii ) instabilities and evaporation lead to rapid cloud disruption .",
    "together these effects imply that the lifetimes of the clumps are likely to be much shorter that the times required to accelerate them to the observed speeds .",
    "a second possibility is that the clumps are formed from the cooling of very high temperature ( @xmath7 k ) shock - heated gas , already moving at high radial velocities .",
    "in , fact a similar picture has been suggested in the context of starburst - driven galaxy outflows @xcite , and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies hosting starbursts and agn @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , one has not only to reconcile the clump formation process with the prevailing outflow scenario , but also explain how molecules like co and hcn can form .",
    "these species require solid surfaces to trigger their production as gas phase production is likely to be highly inefficient in the presence of a strong uv background , and thus dust grains must be preserved throughout the entire heating / cooling cycle .",
    "this is not an easy requirement because grains are sputtered by nuclear and grain - grain collisions and thus rapidly destroyed in such hot environments .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to explore the possibility that the observed molecular clumps condense out of the quasar outflow material as a result of thermal instabilities occurring in the cooling gas . carrying out a detailed examination of the dynamical structure of qso outflows , we conclude that the optimal location for the formation of dusty clumps is within the shocked gas during the energy - driven stage of the evolution .",
    "we then carry out a set of detailed numerical simulations of clump formation at this stage , which include dust cooling and destruction , electron thermal conduction , and atomic / ionic cooling and heating process that account for the qso radiation field .",
    "the inclusion of this extended number of physical processes allows us to draw a series of robust conclusions as to the feasibility of the formation molecular clumps though condensation in qso driven outflows .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the physics of qso driven outflows and the cooling of shocked material . in ",
    "3 we describe our initial conductions and simulation methods , and in  4 we present our results . we conclude in  5 with a discussion of the implications of these results for clump formation in qso outflows , and we include appendices that discuss the formation of multiphase media and self - shielding in further detail .",

    "the kinetic energy of the shock is transferred to protons , which therefore carry most of the thermal pressure , rather than electrons that mediate compton cooling .",

    "a relativistic plasma ( @xmath36 k ) as that produced by the reverse shock may undergo pair production catastrophic cooling @xcite .",

    ", thus justifying our assumption that gravity force can be neglected in the energy - driven phase . ]      from these asymptotic limits , we can demonstrate that the shell always undergoes a strong acceleration at the transition between the two different driving phases . during the momentum - driven phase",

    "[ eq14 ]    the above inequality remains true for any physically reasonable value of @xmath56 up to @xmath57 .",
    "this fact has an important consequence .",
    "it implies that during the acceleration the shell might be disrupted and fragmented by raleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities @xcite .",
    "in fact , the stability condition for the shell is that @xmath58 so that the `` effective gravity '' points from the more dilute hot medium into the shell . stated differently , stability requires @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the constant expansion velocity found in both phases guarantees only marginal stability , and strong rt instabilities are expected to develop during the transition phase .",
    "the magnitude of the radial acceleration at @xmath31 is g_s(r_c ) r_s , [ eq15 ] where we have used the fact that @xmath61 .",
    "the growth rate of the rt instability on spatial scale @xmath62 @xcite is given by @xmath63^{1/2 } \\simeq \\left[{2\\pi \\vert g_s(r_c )      \\vert \\over \\lambda } \\right]^{1 \\over 2 } , \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] the second equality arising from the fact that the density contrast between the shell and the shocked ism is @xmath64 .",
    "note also that the instability grows first on the shortest scales and it diverges as @xmath65 . at these small scales ,",

    "rt^-1 = = 10 ^ 5 _ 200 ^ 1/3 ^2_-1 m_,8 ^ 1/2 .",
    "[ eq17 ] hence we see that the rt instability grows on a very short time scale as the shell enters the energy - driven phase .",
    "the nonlinear evolution produces a fragmentation of the shell into clumps . the hot medium behind the reverse shock wraps around them ;",
    "at the same time , the ram pressure on the clumps decreases so they lag with respect to the contact discontinuity .      once formed , the cold clumps are rapidly ablated and eventually destroyed by the hot material flowing past them .",
    "@xcite showed that if hot material moves past a clump of radius @xmath68 at a subsonic velocity , @xmath69 that is much larger than the clump internal sound speed , it will shred it on a `` crushing '' timescale given by t_cc = , [ eq18 ] where @xmath70 is the initial density ratio between the clump and the surrounding hot medium .",
    "while this is extended somewhat in the case in which the exterior medium is moving supersonically with respect to its own soundspeed @xcite , this is not a big effect in our case in which the hot medium behind the shell is only mildly transonic .",
    "as the clumps originate from the shell , their sizes must be less than the radius of the shell at the time of break - up , given by the ( maximal ) shock cooling length in the momentum - driven phase @xmath71 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq07 ] ) .",
    "the density contrast between the post- and pre - shock material in a radiative shock is equal to the square of the mach number of the shock @xmath72 , where we have neglected the small velocity difference between the shell and the shock and assumed a pre - shock temperature of @xmath73 k to compute the sound speed @xmath74 . on the contrary , the analogous density contrast in the energy - driven phase when the reverse shock becomes adiabatic is only a factor of 4 .",
    "hence , @xmath75 . with these assumptions we get that t_cc t_c = 3.1 _ 200 ^ 1/3 ^2_-1 m_,8 ^ 1/2 , [ eq19 ] which means that the clumps are ablated and mixed with the hot medium on a time that is short with respect to the outflow typical lifetime ( @xmath76 yr ) , meaning that they can not contribute to the high velocity , cold and molecular clumps observed in quasar outflows . on the other hand , the column depth of the shell at break - up is relatively large @xmath77 @xmath78 meaning that if electron thermal conduction from the hot medium proceeds at the ( isotropic ) spitzer value , the clumps may be preserved by an evaporative flow significantly longer ( @xmath79 ) , as estimated from the scalings measured in @xcite .",
    "thus , while the broken shell is not likely to contribute to the cold observed gas , the issue of the role of anisotropic conduction during the stage of shell break - up merits further investigation .",
    "however , regardless of the arguments given on the fragmentation , ablation and final dispersal of the cold clumps , an additional issue prevents their identification with the observed high - velocity molecular components in qso outflows .",
    "this has to do with the limited amount of mass in the fragments .",
    "the forward shock at @xmath80 travels at a speed @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the ratio of specific heats , taken to be 5/3 .",
    "the mass outflow rate at the forward shock is then given by m_2 = 4_g(r_2 ) r_2 r_2 ^ 2 = v_s , e .",

    "[ eq21 ] to obtain the mass ratio between the shocked ism and the shell mass we finally need to multiply by the timescale of the two phases .",
    "the shell can grow only until @xmath85 , a distance reached after a time @xmath86 ; cooling and condensation of the shocked ism can occur only up to a radius @xmath87 kpc ( see next section ) reached after a time @xmath88 . by substituting these values into eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) , we find that the mass ratio is equal to = 26.6 _ 200 ^ 1/3 ^2_-1 m_,8 ^ 1/2 .",
    "[ eq22 ] thus , most of the outflowing mass is contained in the shock - heated ism behind the forward shock .    finally , the survival of dust grains necessary to catalyze the formation of molecules is much more likely to occur as they pass through the forward shock travelling at a velocity @xmath89 , rather than across the wind shock ( velocity @xmath90 ) .",
    "thus , in addition to the destruction and mass budget problems of the shell fragments , the lack of dust grains within them is also a concern , hampering the only efficient channel available to explain the observed molecular content .",
    "we now explore the alternative scenario in which cold clumps condense out of the shock - heated ambient material behind the _ forward _ shock at @xmath80 via a thermal instability .",

[ eq21fs ] this timescale is shorter than the dynamical time of the shock @xmath95 myr only for @xmath96 kpc . beyond this radius",
    "the outer shock becomes adiabatic , thus inverting the standard sequence adiabatic - radiative usually expected for e.g. stellar winds and supernova explosions in quasi - uniform media .",
    "this is due to the isothermal stratification of the halo gas which forces the cooling time to increase with radius . as the two timescales differ only by a factor of 5 , the shock is far from isothermal and it is not clear whether a new shell can form in this intermediate regime .",
    "it appears unlikely , though , that the cooling structure of the medium would resemble the thin shell characterizing the momentum - driven phase .",
    "next , we want to compute the final temperature of the cooling gas , which is regulated by the energy balance between cooling and photoelectric heating by the qso uv radiation .",
    "we assume that the bolometric luminosity of the qso is the one derived above , i.e. l_e = m_= ^4 = 1.110 ^ 13 _ 200 ^ 4 l_. [ eq23 ] in order to compute the hydrogen ionizing ( @xmath97 ev ) photon rate , @xmath98 , corresponding to the eddington luminosity eq .",

    "hence , by substituting , we find that the heating rate goes as h_= h__b(t ) n^2 = n , [ eq28b ] which is independent of the photoionization rate and inversely proportional to the recombination time of the gas @xmath115    as @xmath116 for @xmath117 , @xmath118 and any value of @xmath119 , we can assume that hydrogen is fully ionized , @xmath120 . in this case the cooling ( in @xmath121 @xmath122 ) is only provided by free - free , for which c 1.4210 ^ -27 n^2 c_0 n^2 .",

    "this conclusion however must be interpreted as an upper limit to the temperature because while hydrogen is mostly ionized as we have seen , heavier elements are likely to be only partially ionized and can continue to contribute to the cooling .",
    "the above argument shows that indeed there is a `` window of opportunity '' for the gas heated by the forward shock to radiatively cool via two - body interactions in a region extending from @xmath31 to about 5 kpc . whether this cooling leads to the formation of clumps via a thermal instability",
    "can only be assessed by numerical simulations .",
    "if these clumps indeed form , they will be born with the same velocity of the hot gas and therefore they would not suffer from ablation as those resulting from the momentum - driven shell fragmentation discussed above . therefore they could persist and reach distances in excess of 10 kpc , in agreement with recent experimental findings @xcite .",

    "including these two effects shifts the cooling and heating curves from their @xcite values to those shown in the lower panels of figure [ fig2 ] . by comparing the cooling curves in this panel to those in the middle panel",

    ".    on the other hand , as the energy input from compton scattering is @xmath170 rather than density squared , it has the largest impact at the lowest densities , becoming so large in the 0.6 @xmath122 case as to exceed the cooling rate for all gas with @xmath171k . at these low densities ,",

    "compton effects are still important at 6 @xmath122 , but have little effect at densities at or above 60 @xmath122 , falling well below the atomic / ionic cooling rates at high temperatures , and well below the photoheating rates at low temperatures .",
    "a final complication to the evolution of the outflowing material is the presence of dust , which is able to also provide additional mechanisms for cooling as well as heating , although the latter is negligible compared to the photoelectric heating by the qso . when the thermal energy of electrons ejected from the grain surface is less than the energy of electrons recombining on positively charged grains , as is the case when a strong uv field is present , there is a net cooling of the gas .",
    "this cooling rate depends on the flux in the uv ( `` habing '' ) band 6 - 13.6 ev , @xmath172 , where the source flux is normalized to the habing flux @xmath173 @xmath174 . for our qso",
    "we take @xmath175 , with @xmath176 the wavelength width of the habing band ( 1163 a ) , which corresponds to @xmath177 in our fiducial model .",

    "this result clearly shows that dust cooling , if grains survive the passage through the forward shock , dominates over free - free and might be competitive with radiation losses from heavy elements , if the latter are substantially ionized .",
    "in addition to recombination cooling , dust grains can also radiatively cool the gas . thermal energy from the gas is transferred to the grains by ion - grain and electron - grain collisions , and subsequently radiated in the infrared by the dust .",

    "however , sputtering of the dust from the hot medium leads to dust destruction on a similar timescale .",
    "the removal of this coolant stalls gas cooling for @xmath208 years until the significantly longer times at which line cooling and bremsstrahlung processes are able to operate . during this period ,",
    "the amplitude of density fluctuations drops to @xmath209% , down by a large factor from the initial value .    once cooling begins to operate efficiently , however , the temperature of the gas drops rapidly , beginning with the densest regions .",
    "as underdense regions are over - pressurized with respect to cooler clumps , a pressure wave compresses the dense regions further , leading to a rapid increase of density fluctuations to rms amplitudes greater than 300 @xmath122 .",
    "finally , as cooling becomes more widespread , the gas throughout the simulation drops to the roughly constant @xmath158 k temperature floor set by the balance between photo - heating and atomic cooling . at this point",
    "the pressure gradients switch , such that once again the densest regions of the simulations are the ones with the highest pressure . at this stage ,",
    "the clumps begin to dissolve , leading to rms density fluctuations that decrease rapidly and continuously , falling to @xmath210 @xmath122 at a time of 30 myr .",
    "thus , clumps represent only a transient phase during the outflow evolution .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , this steady tendency of the gas cool to a single phase occurs even in the presence of the compton heating provided by the qso radiation field .",
    "this is because , even though a two - phase medium is possible at @xmath211 k @xmath122 ( as shown in appendix a ) , by the time this pressure is reached at the end of the simulation , there are simply no regions left with low enough densities to move towards the hot stable phase depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "note this evolution towards a uniform single - phase medium occurs even with our choice of a vary large initial rms amplitude of the fluctuations .",
    "this suggests that it is extremely difficult for a two - phase medium to develop in a qso outflow such as the one described here .      in a second simulation",
    ", we repeated our fiducial case , but now also including electron thermal conduction .",
    "this leads to the time evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : run3evol ] , and the corresponding slices of number density and pressure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : run3slice ] . like the run without conduction",
    ", there is an initial phase of rapid cooling which is terminated by the destruction of the dust , and like the run without conduction , this occurs simultaneously with a rapid decrease in the magnitude of the density fluctuations . in this case however , the presence of conduction leads to much more uniform conditions in the rarified medium , punctuated by dense clumps , whose larger internal energy per unit volume causes them to be less affected by conduction than their surroundings .    as in the case without conduction ,",
    "these densest regions cool first , and the pressure of the exterior medium compresses them further . by @xmath212 myr",
    "this leads to very large density contrasts arranged into a network of clumps and filaments , whose appearance is not unlike those observed in cosmological simulations , although in this case they are shaped by pressure gradients rather than by gravity .",
    "this arrangement is short - lived however , as the gas cools to @xmath158 k throughout the simulation , pressure gradients reverse , and as in the fiducial case , density contrasts are rapidly washed away as the thermodynamic structures converges towards a single , cold phase . again , this motion towards a uniform single - phase medium occurs even in the presence of significant compton heating and extremely large initial density contrasts , raising the question of just how extreme conditions must become to sustain a two - phase medium in a qso outflow .      to address this question , we carried out two additional runs , each with a compton background whose flux was artificially boosted by a factor of 100 , but with all other simulations parameters left unchanged .",
    "in this case , the minimum pressure at which two phases can exist simultaneously is raised by two orders of magnitude to @xmath213 k @xmath161    in the first of these runs we neglected electron thermal conduction , leading to the results shown in figures [ fig : run2evol ] and [ fig : run2slice ] .",
    "the early stages of this simulation remain the same as in the first two cases , with dust cooling rapidly reducing the gas temperature by about 20% during the first @xmath73 years , until rapid sputtering destroys the dust . also like the cases above",
    ", this phase is accompanied by a strong drop in density contrasts , as pressure differences act to erase the largest density peaks , followed by a rapid increase in density contrasts , as rapid cooling in these clump drops their pressure well below the pressure in the surrounding medium .",
    "unlike previous runs , however , the temperature of the rarefied gas during this phase remains high , as compton heating is able to exceed cooling in all gas with densities below @xmath213 k @xmath214/(@xmath215 k ) = 15 @xmath161 this leads to a distribution of cold , low pressure clumps with densities @xmath216 @xmath217 which are embedded in a largely - uniform rarified medium .",
    "as the gas within these clumps cools to the temperature floor of @xmath158 k , they accrete even more material , until the exterior medium becomes extremely rarified .",
    "at this point the mass - weighted average temperature deviates strongly from the volume weighted temperature .",
    "this is because the cold phase contains almost all of the mass , but the hot phase fills most of the volume while containing only a small fraction of the mass . in this case , a stable two - phase medium configuration , indeed , is achieved by the system .",
    "finally , we carried out a simulation in which we both artificially boosted the flux of the compton background by a factor of 100 , and included the impact of electron thermal conduction . in this case , the earliest phases of the evolution follow those of the previous runs , but at later times , electrons carry heat into the cold clumps , disrupting those with size smaller than the field length ( about 25 - 30 pc ) .",
    "this disruption of the smallest clumps causes a significant decrease in the rms density fluctuations , which , by @xmath218 years , drop to @xmath219 @xmath217 the smallest value of any of the simulations . this means that only few clumps survive to cool to 8000 k.    on the other hand , the few clumps that do manage to cool experience strong density enhancements at late times .",
    "this is due not only to the hot , pressurized medium in which they are embedded , but also to the additional compression caused by the pressure wave produced by the conductive evaporation of the clump external layers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to rare , but very high density @xmath220 @xmath122 clumps , surrounded by a largely uniform hot medium .",
    "thus while slices from the simulations ( not shown ) are mostly featureless , the few high density clumps lead to the large rms fluctuations present at late times in fig . [",
    "fig : run4evol ] .",
    "thus , this case leads to a two phase medium with density contrasts that are even larger than in the case without conduction , although the majority of the mass now remains in the hot phase .      to quantify the evolution of the structures in our simulations further , we computed the density power spectrum , p(k ) , where @xmath221 and the wave number @xmath222 is equal to @xmath223 divided by the wavelength of the perturbation . in this case , the total rms density fluctuations are ^2 = 4 ( ) ^3 p(k ) d ln k , and thus in fig .",
    "[ fig : powespectra ] we show the evolution of the structure in our simulations as quantified by @xmath224 the upper panels of this figure quantify the three stages of evolution in the fiducial compton background case : first initial pressure differences act to rapidly suppress small - scale fluctuations , then larger scale fluctuations are built up as the pressure drops in dense , more rapidly - cooling areas , and finally fluctuations on all scales are damped as the medium as a whole drops to @xmath158k .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : powespectra ] correspond to the runs in which the compton flux has been boosted by a factor of 100 . in this case",
    "increased heating in the first stage of the evolution leads to an even more rapid disruption of the the initial fluctuations than seen in fiducial case .",
    "however , at late times , a lasting two - phase medium develops . in the @xmath225",
    "run this is made up of moderately dense @xmath226 @xmath122 structures on a range of scales , but in the conductive case these structures are extremely dense @xmath227 @xmath122 and compressed down to the resolution limit of our simulations .",
    "we have studied the origin of the cold molecular clumps recently detected in co and hcn emission in qso outflows .",
    "we first described the physical properties of the radiation - driven outflow and show that a transition from a momentum- to a energy - driven case must occur at radial distances of @xmath0 kpc . during this transition , the dense shell fragments due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , but we find that these clumps are likely to contain very little mass , and they are rapidly ablated and destroyed by the hot gas in which they are immersed .",
    "we have thus also explored an alternative scenario in which clumps form from thermal instabilities at @xmath228 kpc , possibly containing enough dust to catalyze molecule formation .",
    "we investigate this processes with 3d two - fluid ( gas + dust ) numerical simulations of a kpc@xmath2 patch of the outflow , including atomic and dust cooling , thermal conduction , dust sputtering , photoionization from the qso radiation field , and self - shielding ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we find that in all cases dust grains are rapidly destroyed during @xmath3 years ; however , and while cool clumps are present in the fiducial run , they appear only as a transient feature that is washed away as cooling is completed .",
    "in fact , a stable two - phase medium with dense clumps is found only if we artificially enhance the qso radiation field by a factor 100 .",
    "this result , together with the complete destruction of the dust grains , renders the interpretation of molecular outflows a very challenging problem .",
    "we pause for a caveat .",
    "we have shown that the cooling post - shock gas can not be piled - up in a well - formed shell due to the fact that qso outflows , expanding in the steep halo density profile , are rayleigh - taylor unstable at all times .",
    "in fact , the arguments given for the momentum - driven shell in sec .",
    "2.2 apply exactly to the energy - driven phase we are discussing . the hot shocked wind gas wraps clumps around and rapidly shreds them .",
    "however , if the gas is thermally unstable , fragments form by thermal instability on a timescale @xmath229 myr ( from our simulations ) that is comparable or shorter than the rt growth timescale ( see eq .",
    "17 , but with @xmath31 now at least 10 times larger ) .",
    "this might lead to a different scenario , that is the one we have explored here .",
    "cold clumps are embedded in a hot interclump medium ; the two components are in pressure equilibrium .",
    "hence , clumps are protected from ablation by the hot gas surrounding them , and might survive longer .",
    "a more robust conclusion on the clump survival in a accelerated two - phase medium requires additional study . nevertheless , the above qualitative arguments suggest that this situation is more promising than the rt unstable case .",
    "how the physical conditions leading to clump formation might be realized in the environment of quasars is unclear .",
    "contrary to intuition , cold clumps do not form in the fiducial , standard conditions because the heating is insufficient to support a stable hot phase until the medium as a whole has cooled .",
    "instead , a stable two phase medium would require a much stronger energy input from the quasar that is inconsistent with the radiated power .",
    "one might speculate that other heating mechanisms might be at work .",
    "the most likely among these is the contribution of relativistic particles .",
    "although this solution appears unlikely , it is certainly worth further scrutiny , given the thorny questions open by our investigation .",
    "our simulations include all the most relevant physics apart from magnetic fields , self - gravity , and the impact of the bulk motion of the medium as clump formation occurs . although anisotropic conduction due to the presence of magnetic fields could slow electron thermal conduction , conduction not appear to be a key process in determining the final state of the gas .",
    "furthermore , while gravity in principle could produce a collapse of the cold clumps , we show in appendix a , self - gravity can be safely neglected as a result of the outflow expansion , as the gas is like torn apart by expansion on a much shorter time - scale that it can gravitationally collapse .",
    "this point adds yet another puzzling problem . if self - gravity can not confine the clumps ( in case they form ) , then they must be pressure confined .",
    "however , as the outflow expands to larger radii , the internal density drops and the clumps are progressively less shielded agains the uv quasar radiation acting to dissociate co molecules . moreover ,",
    "if densities become low enough , the cold gas can also become ionized .",
    "this might be broadly consistent with the evidence of ionized gas recently found at large distances from the qso but still clearly associated with it @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the presence of cold molecular clumps in qso outflows represents a difficult theoretical challenge .",
    "our study shows that neither a scenario in which these components are galactic clouds entrained and accelerated by the outflow , nor the one in which they condense out of the fast , outward moving gas appear to be viable under `` normal '' conditions .",
    "thus , the solution to the problem is in demand of further investigations .",

    "here we show that the hot postshock cooling gas must eventually settle onto a two - phase thermodynamical equilibrium made of a cold phase embedded into a more rarefied hot intercloud medium .",
    "there are two contributions to the gas heating : photoionization , effective at temperatures @xmath230 k ( see eq .",
    "[ eq30 ] ) , and compton heating arising from the qso radiation field at temperatures below the compton temperature , @xmath162 .",
    "if we impose that the gas is thermal equilibrium , i.e. @xmath231 , where @xmath232 and @xmath233 are is the photoionization and compton heating , respectively .",
    "h_n_h + _ c n_e = n_e n ( t ) [ eq35 ] or , using the definition of the ionization fraction @xmath234 , _ h _ + _ c = n(t ) .",
    "[ eq36 ] by further introducing @xmath235 , and defining @xmath236 and @xmath237 , the previous equation is simply written as x_e = .",
    "[ eq37 ] we finally introduce the non - dimensional variables @xmath238 , and @xmath239 to obtain",
    "[ eq49 ] recall that the ionization fraction is obtained by imposing photoionization equilibrium : x_e = , [ eq50 ] where @xmath240 .",
    "note that for @xmath116 , corresponding to heating time scales much shorter than the recombination time in the gas , @xmath241 . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq49])-([eq50 ] ) , we obtain an implicit form for the equilibrium curve @xmath123 ^2 + ^2 + ( + ) + 2- 1 = 0 .",
    "[ eq51 ]    the properties of a multiphase medium are canonically studied in the pressure - temperature phase plane ( i.e. the phase diagram ) in which the thermal equilibrium curve @xmath242 is plotted .",
    "( [ eq51 ] ) gives the required relation between pressure and temperature .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , where for illustration purposes only we have used a cie cooling function .",
    "note that in the numerical simulation we properly account for photoionization effects which , however , do not change the graph qualitatively . from the figure , we clearly see the existence of a cold ( @xmath243 k ) and a hot phase ( @xmath244 ) in an extended range of pressures @xmath245 in c.g.s . units .",
    "cooling the gas below @xmath73 k and at the same time keeping thermal equilibrium would require implausibly high pressures .",
    "one might wonder if the self - gravity might produce a collapse of the cold clumps .",
    "the answer is negative , and self - gravity can be safely neglected as a result of the very fast outflow expansion . to see this ,",
    "let us define the free - fall time as @xmath246 and the expansion time scale as @xmath247 .",
    "for a spherical expansion , @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is the density at @xmath250 kpc providing the initial condition for our simulation . recall that the outflow velocity is constant ( see eq .",
    "[ eq13 ] ) , i.e. @xmath251 const .",
    "then , by using the subscript 0 to denote quantities at @xmath252 kpc we find that @xmath253 is achieved at a value @xmath254 . as @xmath255 myr and @xmath256 myr , then @xmath257 or @xmath258 .",
    "this implies that the outflow expansion time is always shorter than the free - fall time .",
    "physically this means that gravity perturbations are  stretched away \" by the expanding flow , or stated differently , the density drops due to outflow expansion so rapidly that gravity perturbations can not grow .",
    "this argument also justifies the neglect of self - gravity in our simulations .",
    "as the gas cools due to thermal instability and condenses into dense clumps which might eventually become optically thick and therefore self - shield against ionizing radiation coming from the quasar . in this case , the photoionization rate , and hence the heating , is considerably reduced and may become very small .",
    "a precise treatment of this effect would required radiative transfer calculations that are beyond the scope of the present paper . however , in order to include self - shielding in an approximate manner into the simulations we proceed as follows .",
    "first we define a self - shielding gas density , @xmath259 , such that the opacity to ionizing photons of the gas in a cell becomes unity : = n_h _ h x = ( 1-x_e ) n_s _ h x = 1 .",
    "[ eq41 ] in the previous equation , @xmath260 @xmath261 is the photoionization cross section at 1 ryd , corresponding to photons with the shortest mean free - path and contributing most to photo - heating ; @xmath262 is 10 pc , approximately the field length at the mean initial density .",
    "the value of @xmath234 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) .",
    "it follows that n_s^-1 = ( 1-x_e ) _ h x ; [ eq42 ]    to catch the photoionization rate reduction , we use a fit to detailed radiative transfer simulation performed by @xcite . such formula giver the actual self - shielded photoionization rate , @xmath263 received by the cell with respect to the optically thin value , @xmath264 : = 0.98 ^-2.28 + 0.02 ^-0.84 [ eq43 ] ."
