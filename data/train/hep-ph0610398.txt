    "strongly interacting matter , being subject of qcd , appears in different phases , depending on the temperature and the chemical potential , which characterize a thermalized system .",
    "thereby , distinct regions of the corresponding qcd phase diagram can exhibit rich structures , especially in the areas of high temperature and density , where deconfinement is expected .",
    "however , also for moderate temperature and density in the hadronic phase one expects a change in properties of matter and its constituents , the hadrons . in photoproduction off nuclei ( cb - taps  @xcite , tagx  @xcite , leps  @xcite , clas  @xcite ) or by measurements of the dilepton channel in @xmath1 collisions ( hades  @xcite ) , @xmath2 reactions ( kek  @xcite ) or heavy - ion collisions ( e.g.  ceres  @xcite , na60  @xcite , star  @xcite ) the study of medium - induced modifications for light mesons is pursued .",
    "since hadrons are confined composite objects of the fundamental degrees of freedom of qcd , excited from a ground state , it becomes possible to probe changes of the qcd vacuum at various conditions .",
    "a quantitative description of hadron properties can be linked , within the qcd sum rule approach , to expectation values of quark and/or gluon operators  the qcd condensates .",
    "we consider here the four - quark condensates and relate their density dependencies to spectral modifications of @xmath0 meson and nucleon in cold nuclear matter .",
    "qcd sum rules  @xcite match non - perturbative qcd condensates to hadronic quantities .",
    "therefore each hadron considered is represented by an interpolating current @xmath3 built out of quarks and gluons . the correlation function @xmath4 | \\psi \\rangle\\ ] ]    is evaluated , on the one side for time - like momenta @xmath5 , where the physical hadrons are realized , and on the other side in terms of quarks and gluons via an operator product expansion ( ope ) for large space - like euclidian momenta . both representations for @xmath6",
    "are related using subtracted dispersion relations .",
    "thus , integrals over spectral densities on the hadronic side correspond to qcd condensates , which enter as expectation values of the ope terms .",
    "the leading condensates are the chiral condensate @xmath7 , a measure for chiral symmetry breaking , the gluon condensate @xmath8 , related by the trace anomaly to a breaking of scale invariance , the mixed quark - gluon condensate @xmath9 , and condensates of mass dimension 6 : the triple gluon condensate @xmath10 and four - quark condensates @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is symbolic for all possible structures specified below ) .",
    "the extension to finite temperatures and densities induces on the ope side modification of the condensates . for cold nuclear matter ,",
    "modelled in leading order as fermi gas of non - interacting nucleons , this dependence @xmath13 is linear in the baryon density @xmath14 and dictated by nucleon matrix elements @xmath15 .",

    "a list of all possible four - quark condensates follows from the demanded lorentz invariance , invariance with respect to parity and time reversal and symmetry under @xmath36 of the normal ordered expectation values @xmath37 .",

    "[ tab : fqclist ] the two possible color singlets are listed which transform into each other by fierz relations in the case of identical flavors presented here . note that this four - quark condensate catalog increases when considered for more flavor degrees of freedom , also because flavor mixing terms are realized .    in particular sum rule calculations , distinct linear combinations of four - quark condensates occur and their relevance will be case - specific .",
    "this prevents from an extraction of a particular four - quark condensate although the qcd condensates are generic for the whole hadronic spectrum . for quantitative evaluations the four - quark condensates , even in vacuum not well - known , are often expressed by the squared chiral condensate , i.e.  a factorization ansatz motivated by large-@xmath40 arguments  @xcite . in linearized form w.r.t .  the density",
