    "nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) have been much investigated , the main goal being the discovery of their common and distinguishing features as compared to equilibrium states . a promising approach to this problem",
    "is the study of phase transitions : since equilibrium critical phenomena display a large degree of universality , it is natural to ask to what extent these universal features remain characteristic of nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "the basic complication with ness is that , in addition to the interactions which entirely define the equilibrium properties , the dynamics is also essential in determining the steady state properties .",
    "thus , for example , a classification of nonequilibrium phase transitions requires not only the understanding of the role of symmetries of the order parameter , the range of interactions and the dimensionality of the system , but the clarification of both the relevance of conservation laws imposed by dynamical symmetries and the range of the dynamical processes .",
    "possibly , new dimensionality and anisotropy effects in the dynamics may also be important .",
    "the most frequently studied models with nonequilibrium phase transitions are generalizations of systems with model a type dynamics @xcite .",
    "the transitions in these systems have been shown to be robust against local nonequilibrium perturbations which do not conserve the order parameter @xcite and , remarkably , this robustness was found to persist even if the _",
    "dynamical _ perturbations broke the discrete symmetry of the system @xcite .",
    "both locality and the nonconserving character of the perturbations are essential for the phase transition to stay in the ising universality class .",
    "indeed , nonlocal nonequilibrium dynamics generates effective long  range forces and thus changes the universality class dramatically @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium generalizations of model b type dynamics ( with conserved order parameter ) are more interesting . external fields or local , _ anisotropic _",
    ", nonequilibrium perturbations may drive the system into a ness with phase transitions which are not characterized by any known equilibrium universality class @xcite , or belong to universality classes with long  range interactions @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium generalizations of the case when a nonconserved order parameter is coupled to a conserved quantity have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was found that linear coupling to a conserved quantity generates power ",
    "law correlations for the order parameter .",
    "this suggests that , in this situation , long  range effective interactions are generated in the system , which in turn govern the critical behavior at the phase transition .",
    "there are several other nonequilibrium phase transitions which have been studied without considering any equilibrium context .",
    "most notable among these are phase transitions associated with the presence of an absorbing state ( directed percolation ) @xcite , and the roughening transition in surface growth and equivalent models such as the kardar  parisi ",
    "zhang equation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we continue the investigation of nonequilibrium generalizations of models originally proposed to describe equilibrium critical dynamics .",
    "our aim is to study an example where there is a reversible mode  coupling between the order parameter and another ( conserved ) field , using the field  theoretic dynamic renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite .",
    "a simple example of this type of systems is the heisenberg model for isotropic ferromagnets where precession terms introduce a coupling among the different spin components ( model j according to the classification in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for early rg studies of this model see ref .",
    "@xcite ; a comprehensive review of the critical dynamics of ferromagnets is given in ref .",
    "however , similar to the purely relaxational dynamics of models a and b , the effect of a ( spatially isotropic ) violation of detailed balance can be removed by a simple rescaling ( see sec.[modelj ] ) .",
    "we shall thus mainly consider a more complicated model which was originally introduced by sasvri , schwabl , and szpfalusy in the context of structural phase transitions @xcite . this sss model consists of a non ",

    "the @xmath8 realization describes the critical dynamics of planar ferromagnets and superfluid helium 4 @xcite ( for reviews regarding dynamic critical phenomena in superfluid helium , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while the case @xmath9 corresponds to the dynamics of isotropic antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the sss model , with its dynamic exponent @xmath5 ( below the upper critical dimension @xmath10 ) thus encompasses models e and g ( according to ref .",

    "theoretic rg studies of the sss model @xcite to a nonequilibrium situation by assuming that the order parameter components @xmath11 and conserved angular momenta @xmath12 are attached to heat baths of _ different _ temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "thus the detailed  balance condition required for near  equilibrium dynamics is violated and the flow of energy between the two heat baths ensures that the steady state is out of equilibrium .",
    "the introduction of two temperatures leads to an additional variable in the problem , namely the temperature ratio @xmath13 ( of which no analog can be constructed for model j ) . by studying the rg flow equations to one  loop order ( first order in @xmath14 )",
    ", we find _ two new fixed points _ corresponding to the cases @xmath4 and @xmath15 , respectively , in addition to the equilibrium fixed points of the sss model .",
    "the latter are ( i ) the usual gaussian fixed point ( describing static and dynamic mean  field behavior , @xmath16 ) , ( ii ) the model a fixed point , corresponding to a decoupling of the conserved fields from the order parameter , with the nontrivial static exponents of the @xmath0symmetric @xmath17 model and dynamic exponent @xmath18 , and the three nontrivial sss dynamic fixed points consisting of the two so  called _ weak  scaling _ fixed points with the order parameter and conserved quantities fluctuating on different time scales , characterized by the exponents ( iii ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and ( iv ) @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and finally ( v ) the _ strong  scaling _ fixed point with @xmath23 .",
    "the results for ( iv ) and ( v ) actually hold to all orders in @xmath24 , and follow from the exact sum rule @xmath25 @xcite ( see sec .  [ genres ] ) .",
    "stability analysis shows that to one  loop order only the strong  scaling fixed point ( v ) is stable ; however , at least for @xmath8 the actual fixed ",

    "resummation techniques , actually suggests the stability of a weak  scaling fixed point @xcite ) .",
    "the stability of the above fixed points may change in a nonequilibrium situation where the order parameter and conserved variables are allowed to fluctuate at different temperatures , which explicitly introduces different characteristic time scales . indeed , while one of the two new nonequilibrium fixed points , corresponding to ( a ) @xmath15 , is described by model a dynamics @xmath26 ( with the usual @xmath17 model statics ) , albeit accompanied by _",
    "anomalous noise correlations for the conserved fields _ , the second new fixed point , characerized by ( b ) @xmath4 , yields , actually to all orders in @xmath24 , @xmath27 for the order parameter as in equilibrium , but @xmath28 , i.e. : ordinary diffusion for the generalized angular momenta ( note that the above  mentioned equilibrium sum rule does not hold here ) ; this unusual behavior is supplemented by _",

[ looprg ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that while violation of detailed balance might be conceived as a relevant perturbation , in fact the underlying @xmath0 symmetry in conjunction with spatial isotropy and the growing correlation length as the phase transition is approached , effectively _ restores detailed balance _",

    "[ flodia ] , which displays the location of the fixed points and their flow in the space of the dynamical couplings @xmath294 , @xmath344 , and @xmath329 ; notice that both the equilibrium and `` nonequilibrium '' model a fixed points are represented by lines here , because the undetermined value of @xmath287 .",
    "concluding this section , we remark that at each of the fixed points discussed above , including both new nonequilibrium fixed points , the anomalous dimension stemming from the additive renormalization ( [ addsin ] ) vanishes , as does @xmath348 from the field renormalization .",
    "we therefore did not have to take its effects into account explicitly .",
    "we have studied the critical dynamics of @xmath0symmetric systems , including reversible mode  coupling terms , in the framework of effective langevin equations and dynamic field theory , and generalized the equations of motions to nonequilibrium situations where detailed balance is broken . in sec .",
    "[ modelj ] we have argued that for the dynamics of isotropic heisenberg ferromagnets the effect of violating the einstein relation between the spin diffusion constant and the langevin noise strength can be absorbed via rescaling the static nonlinearity and the mode  coupling constant .",
    "hence universal properties can not be affected by this specific form of detailed  balance violation , and the critical point is described by the usual heisenberg model exponents with the equilibrium dynamic critical exponent @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "this fact generalizes previous results regarding the stability of the relaxational models a and b against nonequilibrium perturbations @xcite to a situation where reversible mode  coupling terms are present as well .    on the other hand , for the critical dynamics of planar ferromagnets ( model e ) @xcite or isotropic antiferromagnets ( model g ) @xcite , both incorporated in the @xmath0symmetric sss model @xcite , such a simple rescaling does not remove the effects of detailed  balance violation completely , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ modsss ] .",
    "this is because there appears a new degree of freedom , namely the temperature ratio @xmath349 of the heat baths to which the order parameter and the conserved angular momenta are attached .",
    "this new variable induces different renormalizations for the noise strengths as compared to the onsager coefficients ( sec .",
    "[ looprg ] ) , and therefore genuinely new dynamic and static critical behavior may emerge . indeed , there appear two new fixed points of the resulting rg flow equations , describing continuous phase transitions of entirely nonequilibrium character , namely corresponding to either @xmath4 or @xmath15 , where in the former case even the static critical exponents become modified .",
    "the ensuing dynamic exponents may be interpreted physically by noting that in both cases either the coupling of the order parameter into the diffusion equation for the conserved fields vanishes , while the reverse coupling remains effective , or vice versa .",
    "however , the stability analysis in sec .  [ fpoint ] shows that both of these fixed points are actually unstable , and provided @xmath350 the asymptotic critical behavior is governed by the nontrivial strong  scaling equilibrium fixed point of the sss model characterized again by the static exponents of the @xmath0symmetric heisenberg model and by the dynamic exponent @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the role of detailed balance is actually a weaker one as compared to internal symmetries ; for while breaking a discrete or continuous symmetry typically results in a change of the universality class , detailed balance becomes restored here at the critical point , obviously as a consequence of the underlying @xmath0 rotation symmetry and the spatial isotropy of the model .",
    "we remark that there are some notable exceptions , though , for the relevance of symmetry  breaking terms .",
    "e.g. , the @xmath0 symmetry of the heisenberg model ( [ hamilt ] ) is restored as a consequence of the large critical fluctuations , even when cubic anisotropies are added , if @xmath351 ( with @xmath352 to one  loop order ) @xcite",
    ". we should also cautiously state that our above results relied on the one  loop approximation only , and specifically the stability boundaries might change in more accurate calculations , as seems indeed to be the case for the equilibrium planar model @xcite .",
    "however , in the beta functions @xmath353 and @xmath354 describing the instabilities of the fixed points ( [ neqfp1 ] ) and ( [ neqfp2 ] ) , respectively , no dangerous @xmath6dependences appeared , and it is therefore probably safe to say that these nonequilibrium fixed points will remain unstable even to higher orders in perturbation theory , albeit for @xmath8 the asymptotic region may ultimately be governed by the weak  scaling equilibrium fixed point ( [ wscfp1 ] ) , see also fig .",
    "[ flodia ] .",
    "the remarkable result that violation of detailed balance appears to be an irrelevant perturbation in the rg sense , at least in rotation  invariant and isotropic systems , is of course strengthening the notion of universality even in nonequilibrium situations . probably in many experiments probing the critical dynamics with electromagnetic radiation or neutron scattering ,",
    "the system is not perfectly thermalized and variations in the effective temperatures for the different degrees of freedom can not be avoided completely due to the inevitable critical slowing down which prevents fast relaxation processes .",
    "now if such a perturbation were relevant , its effects would become enhanced drastically in the vicinity of the phase transition , however small the initial deviations from equilibrium might have been .",
    "such a behavior is apparently not observed ; however , it might be interesting to prepare a non  thermalized system on purpose , say by arranging for the in  plane spins @xmath85 and @xmath86 in a planar ferromagnet to be on a different temperature than @xmath87 , conceivably attainable with polarized electromagnetic radiation .",
    "another possibility would be to introduce a long wavelength magnetic field with random time variation . in an antiferromagnetic material",
    ", its effect would cancel for",
    "the staggered magnetization but the coupling to the magnetization would mimic a situation with @xmath309 . for both experimental realizations , or at least in equivalent computer simulations studies , the effects of the above two new fixed points",
    "may then be explored , for these should manifest themselves in nontrivial crossover behavior , and perhaps even the associated anomalous critical exponents and noise correlations might be detected .",
    "we finally remark again that the specific violation of detailed balance investigated here was _",
    "isotropic _ in character , thereby disturbing neither of the underlying symmetries of the sss model , namely @xmath0 symmetry and its spatial isotropy . obviously , it would be interesting to see if the above stability against nonequilibrium perturbations persists even when the detailed  balance violation is applied in an anisotropic manner , e.g. , by coupling the order parameter to conserved angular momenta as above , but arranging the noise strength of the conserved fields to be related to different temperatures in different space directions .",
