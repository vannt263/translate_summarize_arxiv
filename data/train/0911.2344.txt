    "blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies are systems undergoing violent bursts of star formation @xcite , that appear compact in the optical ( starburst diameter @xmath10 kpc ) , and have low intrinsic luminosities ( @xmath11 mag ) and low gas - phase metallicities ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these characteristics make them excellent nearby laboratories for investigating some of the most outstanding questions in the contemporary extragalactic astronomy : i )  they are suitable sites to study the process of galaxy formation and evolution , as they are thought to be the local analogs of the building blocks from which larger systems were formed at high redshift @xcite ; ii )  they allow the determination of the primordial helium abundance with a minimum of extrapolation to early conditions @xcite ; and , iii )  being smaller and less massive than normal galaxies , bcds neither can sustain spiral density waves , nor suffer from disk instabilities , hence they permit the investigation of the star - formation process in a relatively simple environment .    in order to properly characterize the bcd galaxy class , and to get insights into the above topics , detailed spectrophotometric analysis of individual objects , aimed to disentangle their different stellar populations and to elucidate their star - forming histories ( sfh ) , are imperative ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , very few such studies have been done so far @xcite .",
    "these works , all based on traditional observing techniques ( broad- and narrow - band imaging plus long - slit spectroscopy ) , have shown that combining spectroscopy and surface photometry is indeed essential for tackling the problem of bcd evolution .",
    "however , they suffer from several drawbacks , the most severe being the large amount of observing time that they require : acquiring images in several broad- and narrow - band filters , in addition to a series of long - slit exposures sweeping the region of interest , translate into prohibitively long observing times of two or more nights per galaxy .",
    "this usually means that the data are taken under varying atmospheric conditions and , potentially , slight differences in the instrumental setup .",
    "clearly , uncertainties in the combination of such a data set will propagate throughout in the data analysis and interpretation .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy has also the additional problem of the uncertainty on the exact location of the slit .",
    "the relatively new observational method of integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) overcomes these problems .",
    "detailed ifs studies have been carried out for sbs  0335 - 052e with vlt / giraffe @xcite , for the low - luminosity bcd ii  zw  70 with caha 3.5m / pmas @xcite , for five luminous bcds with wht / integral @xcite , for um  408 with gmos - ifu @xcite and for mrk  1418 with pmas @xcite . although the scope of these studies is somehow limited by a small field of view ( fov ) or by low spectral resolution",
    ", they convincingly demonstrate that ifs is the method of choice for small , yet complex star - forming ( sf ) objects like bcds . each single exposure of an integral field spectrograph provides both spatial and spectral information , making the observations an order of magnitude more efficient than any traditional observing technique .",
    "furthermore , ifs provides simultaneously spectra for all spatial resolution elements , under the same instrumental and atmospheric conditions , which guarantees the homogeneity of the dataset .",
    "systems with a high degree of asymmetry in their sf component , such as bcds , hosting two or more well - separated sf regions , can be studied in a comprehensive manner only with 2d spectroscopy .",
    "long standing questions in the field , as the propagation of the star - formation , the generation and dispersal of heavy elements or the abundance gradients , can be approached efficiently only with ifs instruments .    while existing works indicate that the sf activity in bcds proceeds largely in bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are still lacking an understanding of the two - dimensional star - formation pattern .",
    "established is solely that , in the majority ( 90% ) of bcds , the sf regions are not randomly scattered within the low surface brightness ( lsb ) host , but rather confined to its central part , out to @xmath13 exponential scale lengths @xcite . this fact suggests a physical link between the mode of the sf activity in bcds and the shape of the gravitational potential formed by the old , higher mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio stellar lsb host .",
    "some of the most metal - poor bcds , thought to be still in the process of their formation , such as sbs  0335 - 052e @xcite or sbs  1415 + 437 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) , present clear signatures of uni - directional sf propagation .",
    "this process can lead to a _",
    "cometary _ morphology , with the `` comets head '' ( the dominant sf region ) located at the tip of an elongated lsb host delineating the trail of past propagating sf activities @xcite .",
    "an irregular sf propagation pattern in form of a random - walk was reported by a detailed analysis of individual stellar clusters in the luminous bcd eso  338-ig04 @xcite , while the potential role of sf propagation in mrk  370 and mrk  35 has been discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in the two bcds mrk  86 and mrk  409 ,",
    "the ring - morphology of the sf regions suggests that the sf activity could have been triggered by the shock wave produced by multiple sns in a central starburst . in the case of mrk  86 ,",
    "extensive studies @xcite support this hypothesis .",
    "however , because of the small spatial and spectral coverage of the available spectroscopic observations ( * ? ?",
    "* hereaftergdp03 ) , conclusive results for mrk  409 can not be drawn .    in this paper",
    "we show the great potential of ifs when applied to bcds by presenting a pilot study focused on the galaxy mrk  409 (= ngc  3011 ) .",
    "mrk  409 is a luminous ( @xmath14 ) bcd , belonging to the ne morphological class @xcite .",
    "its intriguing gas ionized morphology  a compact nuclear starburst region surrounded by two sf rings at projected galactocentric radii of 5  and 18 , corresponding to 0.64 and 2.3 kpc  makes it an excellent laboratory for investigating the star - formation pattern and abundance gradients in bcds .",
    "we observed the galaxy with the pmas spectrograph mounted on the 3.5 m calar alto telescope .",

    "we observed a total of 6000 sec on the galaxy , with the integration time split into five exposures of 1200 sec each ; additional sky frames were taken moving the telescope several arcmin away from the target position .",
    "calibration frames were observed before and after the galaxy exposures .",
    "these calibrations consist of spectra of emission line lamps ( hgne lamp ) , which are required to perform the wavelength calibration , and spectra of a continuum lamp , necessary to locate the fiber spectra on the ccd and to perform the flat - fielding correction .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard stars bd+75325 and bd+332642 were observed for flux calibration . as usual ,",
    "bias and sky - flat exposures were taken at the beginning and at the end of the night .",
    "the seeing was about 1.8 arcsec .",
    "the data were processed using standard iraf tasks .",
    "the reduction procedure included bias subtraction and image trimming , tracing and extraction , wavelength and distortion calibration , flat - fielding , combination of the individual frames , sky subtraction and flux calibration .",
    "for a detailed description of the individual steps performed in fiber data processing see @xcite .",
    "the typical errors on the wavelength calibration are 0.02  .",
    "the flux calibration was carried out using our observations of spectrophotometric standard stars . by comparing the sensitivity curves obtained for all the spectrophotometric standards observed throughout the three nights of the observing run",
    ", we estimate that the relative uncertainty on the calibration factor is generally equal or less than 2% , except blueward of 4000  , where the curves show a marked change of slope and the uncertainty increases up to about 8% .      in this study",
    "we generate 2d intensity maps for the most important emission lines as well as for different continuum regions .",
    "the relevant parameters of the emission lines ( center , flux and equivalent width ) were determined by fitting single gaussians ; the fit was carried out by using the @xmath43 minimization algorithm implemented by c.  b. markwardt in the _ mpfitexpr _ idl library @xcite .",
    "the  line , in which the absorption component was also visible , was modeled as the sum of two gaussians .",
    "the continuum ( typically 3050 on both sides ) was fitted by a straight line .",
    "lines in a doublet were fitted imposing that they have the same redshift and width .",
    "criteria such as flux , error on flux , velocity and width were used to do a first , automatic assessment of whether to accept or reject a fit .",
    "for instance , lines with too small ( less than the instrumental width ) or too large ( @xmath44  ) widths were flagged out , similar to lines with an error on the flux of more than about 10% ( the exact limits depending on the specific line ) . in order to improve the reliability and stability of fits invoking both an absorption and emission component ,",
    "an additional criterion was applied to the equivalent width of the absorption component ( allowed to vary between 0 and 5  ) .",
    "each individual fit was visually checked , and when necessary , the aforementioned automated quality criteria were overridden ( see @xcite ) .",

    "continuum maps were built in the same way by summing the signal within wavelength intervals free from emission lines or strong sky - lines residuals .",
    "the main advantage of ifs is that it maps an object simultaneously in different continuum bands and emission lines , so that we can obtain at the same time the spatial distribution of the stellar component and of the ionized gas emission .",

    "the values of the different ratios are those characteristic of regions . in the central starburst ,",
    "however , opposite to what is expected in regions photoionized by stars , high values for all ratios are found : [ ]  @xmath47/@xmath52 ; [ ]  @xmath48/  @xmath53 ; [ ]  @xmath49/  @xmath54 ; [ ]  @xmath50/  @xmath55 ) , most probably indicating the presence of an additional ionization mechanism  an _ active galactic nucleus _ ( agn ) or shocks .",

    "by contrast , in the circumnuclear sf knots the /  ratio is only slightly larger than the nominal value of 2.86 @xcite , and implies @xmath58 .",
    "note that , applying the extinction derived in the central region to the whole sf component , as is usually done in long - slit or single - aperture spectroscopic studies ( with , e.g. , the sdss ) , would lead to a large overestimate of the  luminosity and consequently of the star formation rate ( sfr ) . in this respect ,",
    "a spatially resolved 2d determination of the extinction is essential for a proper characterization of the stellar populations and the star formation history of mrk  409 , and more in general of bcd galaxies .    in computing the extinction map",
    ", we corrected the  line for underlying stellar absorption by fitting a gaussian profile to its absorption wings .",
    "for the  line , the absence of absorption wings makes a reliable decomposition impossible . in this case , in principle several approaches could be adopted : a ) to take for  the same value in absorption that for , that is , to set @xmath59 , traditionally the most common strategy ; b ) to apply spectral synthesis models to disentangle the young and old population spectra and , from the model output , estimate the ew ( ) in absorption ; c ) to assume that the absorption in  is negligible .",

    ", we used the reconstructed flux and continuum maps to delimit the regions of interest in the galaxy .",
    "a total of six regions were identified , the five sf located in the ring and the nuclear sf region # 3 ( see fig .  [ fig : images ] ) .",
    "we identified the spaxels corresponding to each of these regions , and summed their spectra together to create the integrated spectrum . in this way",

    "its strong [ ]  @xmath48 emission is also remarkable , suggesting an additional contribution to the ionization , other than photoionization from ob stars .",
    "this comparatively red stellar continuum and the strong absorption features both indicate that the emission is dominated by older stars . the sf regions in the ring display , on contrast , an almost flat continuum with stronger emission lines , such as [ ]  @xmath46 , , [ ]  @xmath47 , , [ ]  @xmath62 and [ ]  @xmath50 , in addition to weak [ ]  @xmath48 emission .",

    "regardless of the model used , any conclusions related to the sfh of the ring should be considered with caution .",
    "it is known that both spectral synthesis approaches are plagued by ambiguities , especially when applied to complex emitting sources , such as starburst galaxies , involving multiple stellar populations of different age and metallicity , and being likely subject to different amounts of intrinsic extinction .",
    "solutions by starlight are guided by the minimal linear combination of age vectors , i.e. they discard out of the available library ssps with a low significance .",
    "aside from the degeneracy problem , the solutions may therefore provide a very fragmentary view of the true sfh in a galaxy . in our concrete case",
    ", the absence of ssps in the age interval between @xmath273 myr and @xmath274 gyr should not be taken as foolproof of cessation of sf activities during that period , and the hypothesis of a low - level star formation in the ring can not be rejected with certainty .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models suffer as well from ambiguities stemming not only from the age - metallicity degeneracy but , as thoroughly discussed in @xcite , by uncertainties in the intrinsic extinction and in the sfh assumed .",
    "the instantaneous and continuous model likely represent two extreme cases and rather poor approximations to the true sfh along the circumnuclear ring .",
    "for example , a continuous sf process over the last @xmath256 gyr with a varying or recently elevated sfr may also match the observations .",
    "however , an investigation of more complex sfhs on the basis of the present data would likely not completely lift uncertainties in the interpretation of the sf ring .",
    "we stress that the satisfactorily agreement between the two conceptually different models used is reassuring .",
    "we are therefore confident in that an instantaneous burst is a better description of the sfh of the individual sf knots in the ring .",
    "furthermore , the morphology of the galaxy does not show any bar or non - axisymmetric features , conditions required for the formation of a galactic rr . in a recent paper , @xcite note that mrk  409 ( ngc  3011 ) has no obvious bar , and place it into the group of galaxies that have `` nuclear rings that can not easily be explained in a resonance framework '' .",
    "hence , both the synthesis models results and the galaxy morphology speak against the presence of a rr in this galaxy , and favor the starburst - driven shock scenario as the most plausible to explain the origin of the sf ring in mrk  409 .",
    "the nature of the nuclear region # 3 is puzzling . as discussed already ,",
    "its observed line ratios suggest an additional non - thermal source .",
    "further support to this interpretation comes from spectral synthesis models which both fail to reproduce its observed sed without large systematic residuals ( cf .",
    "[ fig : model_region3 ] ) .",
    "although inclusion of a power law component along with a variation in the extinction model might produce a better fit , we preferred not to do so , as this would probably not add solid constraints to the understanding of the nature and sfh of the nuclear region .",
