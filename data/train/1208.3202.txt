    "our analysis of oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 shows that both species must reside in gas of low molecular hydrogen fraction ( @xmath104 ) in order to explain the observed abundance ratio between the two species .",
    "h@xmath2 , however , is not efficiently formed in gas with low molecular fractions where the h@xmath9 + h reaction competes with the h@xmath9 + h@xmath1 reaction , meaning that h@xmath2 must primarily reside in regions of higher molecular hydrogen fraction . as such",
    ", it seems likely that there is little overlap in the gas probed by oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and that probed by h@xmath2 in diffuse molecular clouds ( this changes for gas with a low electron fraction where the h@xmath2 + o reaction becomes important ) .",
    "we have made observations of h@xmath2 , oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and co in a diffuse molecular cloud along closely spaced sight lines toward w51 irs2 .",
    "the cosmic - ray ionization rate of h@xmath1 inferred from the h@xmath2 column density is @xmath3  s@xmath4 . observed oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 abundances yield an estimated molecular hydrogen fraction of @xmath79 and a product of @xmath94  s@xmath4 in the atomic outskirts of the cloud , where @xmath8 is defined following @xcite as the ratio of the oh@xmath0 production rate to the cosmic - ray ionization rate of h. combining both ionization rates , we find @xmath5 , such that only 7% of h@xmath0 formed by cosmic - ray ionization goes on to eventually form oh@xmath0 .",
    "a possible explanation for the low oh@xmath0 formation efficiency is the neutralization of h@xmath0 on small grains and pahs , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "detailed chemical modeling that accounts for this process , the change from atomic to molecular gas with cloud depth , and all of the species observed in this diffuse molecular cloud , should provide further insight regarding the extent to which h@xmath2 coexists with oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 .",
