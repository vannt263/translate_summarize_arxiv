    "is the universe ` open ' , flat or ` closed ' ?",
    "this is a major question in observational cosmology , where the meaning is generally intended to be , respectively : ` is the curvature of the universe negative , zero or positive ? '",
    "the latter question is quantified as the measurement of the density parameter , @xmath6 and the ( dimensionless ) cosmological constant , @xmath7 which together determine the curvature @xmath8   and @xmath9 correspond to @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively in @xcite  ( 1993 ) notation . ]",
    "the value of @xmath9 is negative , zero or positive for negative , zero or positive curvature respectively .",
    "recent observations from faint galaxy counts , gravitational lensing , type ia supernovae ( @xcite ) and from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) favour an approximately zero curvature , though what seems to be the presence of geodesic mixing in the cobe observations of the cmb would require a universe which has negative curvature @xcite .    however , if the words ` open ' and ` closed ' in the former question are interpreted to mean ` infinite ' and ` finite ' in spatial volume , respectively , and if the curvature is not positive , then answering the question requires knowing not only the curvature of the universe but also its topology .",
    "in fact , the question should then be reworded into a double question : ` is the universe positively curved ( hence finite ) ? if not",
    ", then is it infinite ( `` open '' ) or finite ( `` closed '' ) in volume ? '",
    "a flat or negatively curved ( hyperbolic ) universe with a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric can be either infinite or finite , a common example of the latter being the flat hypertorus .    moreover , measurement of the topology of the universe is not only likely to be necessary to answer the question under the latter interpretation of the words ` open ' and ` closed ' , but it would help to measure their quantitative meanings under the former interpretation as descriptions of curvature .",
    "the precision attainable is at least as good as that expected from the planck and map satellites .",
    "it is hoped that the global topology of the universe can be either detected or shown in an assumption - free way to be non - measurable within the next decade .",
    "several new observational methods to constrain , detect and/or measure the global topology of the universe have been recently developed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the applications of these methods to observational programmes of major ground - based telescope and satellite projects already started or expected in the coming few years ( sdss , @xcite ; xmm , @xcite ; planck surveyor ; map ) may well result in estimates of the topological parameters of the universe , if these are measurable within the horizon defined in practice by the surface of last scattering ( sls ) .",
    "indeed , specific candidates for the 3-manifold of the spatial hypersurface projected to the present epoch have already been proposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore timely to examine how precisely a significant detection of multiple topological images of a single object or region on the cmb ( due to photons arriving at the observer by multiple paths which cross the universe in different directions ) would constrain the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper .",
    "mathematically , the constraint on the curvature parameters is a consequence of the rigidity theorem of mostow & prasad @xcite , which constrains the curvature radius @xmath12 ( eq .  [ e - defr_c ] ) , and for a fixed value of @xmath12 is a consequence of the effect that @xmath1 has on the redshift - distance relation . to our knowledge , using topology to constrain curvature was first clearly mentioned in a cosmological context by @xcite .",
    "cosmic topology is briefly described in ",
    "[ s - topol ] .",
    "in the case of a detection considered significant , photons emitted by a single collapsed object or from a single region of recombination epoch plasma would have crossed the whole universe in different directions and probably more than once , before arriving at the observer in less than the age of the universe .",
    "these would be considered to emanate from multiple topological images of a single object ( or region ) .",
    "the geometrical relationship between the apparent three - dimensional positions of the different topological images in the covering space ( the nave observer s space ) is related to the shape of the fundamental polyhedron ( parallelepiped in the case of the hypertorus ) .",
    "the linear transformations ( isometries ) between the multiple images , in the covering space , are integer linear combinations of the generators of a group of isometries . for the rectilinear hypertorus with no ` twists ' , the covering space",
    "is @xmath13 the topological images of a single object form a rectangular prismical lattice , the isometries are simply translations , and the generators are three mutually orthogonal vectors",
    ".    these isometries would hold for some particular values of @xmath0 and @xmath14 if these curvature parameters are varied from the values for which the identification was discovered , then the distances between the identified images will no longer be related in the same proportions , and will no longer ( in general ) remain integer linear combinations of a set of generators . in other words , if the curvature parameters are varied , then the objects which previously had been identified as multiple topological images can no longer be explained as such .",
    "another way of looking at this is to consider the predictive power of candidate 3-manifolds . given a candidate 3-manifold , the positions and redshifts of multiple topological images of all known objects visible to large redshifts can be predicted .",
    "if the candidate is correct , then observational confirmation of the predicted images will strengthen the hypothesis .",
    "however , if the candidate is correct in a limited redshift range to a certain precision , _ but slightly wrong values for the curvature parameters are assumed , _ then the multiple topological images in other redshift ranges will not occur at the predicted positions .",
    "the error will depend on the redshift and on the errors in the curvature parameters .    at low redshifts ,",
    "the dependence of the metric on curvature is weak , so the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 would be weak . for multiple topological images at high redshifts distributed in the three - dimensional space inside of the sls , the constraints would be much stronger , i.e. the uncertainties to within which @xmath0 and @xmath1 could be estimated would be much smaller .    on the other hand , a detection of multiple topological imaging of circular subsets of the cobe maps ( @xcite ) , at the sls , without confirmation from topological images inside of the sls , would determine the sign of the curvature , and if this is non - zero , would fix the ratio @xmath15 by the rigidity theorem , where @xmath16 is the particle horizon radius and @xmath12 is the curvature radius [ eq .",
    "( [ e - defr_c ] ) ] .    only a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 would be known ( @xmath17 would be the relation for a 3-manifold with @xmath18 as the covering space ) , and extra information would be needed to find their individual values .",
    "this is because the sls is essentially a spherically symmetric two - dimensional surface , i.e. a sphere , so that there is radial freedom in the relation between redshift and distance which would allow ranges of the values of the two curvature parameters which would leave the mappings on the sphere unchanged .",
    "a cmb topology detection would , of course , be followed up by the search for sub - sls topological images .",
    "if these were found at low redshifts @xmath19 then the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 would most likely remain weak . if they were found at higher redshifts , @xmath20 then the constraints would be stronger .",
    "however , the limited size of observational catalogues at higher redshifts , and the probable relative scarcity of astrophysically stable , bright objects at these redshifts , makes the latter a task much less straightforward than might be hoped for navely .",
    "the goal of this paper is to estimate how precisely @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be estimated , in practice , if sub - sls multiple topological images are detected to high significance .",
    "the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath21 is only a scaling factor , so would not be constrained directly by topology detection .",
    "conversely , the uncertainty of @xmath22 does not ( to first order ) affect the constraints on the curvature parameters by this method",
    ". however , independent constraints on @xmath23 or @xmath24 , such as from nucleosynthesis or from large scale structure , would provide good estimates of @xmath22 if @xmath0 were estimated to high precision ( e.g. @xmath251%).km  s@xmath26  mpc@xmath26 .",

    "both possibilities were suggested in the pre - relativistic epoch by @xcite .",
    "it is often implicitly hypothesized that the topology of the universe is simply - connected . since the density parameter is within an order of magnitude of unity , the observable sphere ( inside the particle horizon ) would in that case be much smaller than the universe by a factor of @xmath27 where @xmath28 [ e.g. see @xcite for discussion of inflation for zero versus negative curvature ] .",
    "if this were correct , then observational cosmology would not be the study of the universe , but only of a microscopic part of the universe expected to be representative of the whole under some scenarios .",
    "this , of course , only provides an aesthetic criterion in favour of an observably ` small ' universe .    however ,",
    "the requirement to have some sort of theory of quantum gravity at the planck epoch ( @xmath29 ) , and the fact that topological evolution in numerous dimensions is common in theories of particle physics , make a finite universe with a non - trivial topology ( non trivial @xmath30 homotopy group ) quite a theoretically likely possibility .    for general reviews on cosmological topology , see @xcite .    for theoretical work on physical explanations of the generation of topology at the quantum epoch , see recent articles such as @xcite .",

    "several authors of the cmb methods have claimed lower limits to the size of the universe of around 40% of the horizon diameter based on observational data from the cobe satellite , particularly for the case of zero curvature , but these claims remain controversial .",
    "@xcite argue that the resolution of cobe is insufficient for any constraints on topology , but more fundamentally , the problem is one of self - consistency of assumptions and hypothesis .",
    "even though the hypothesis tested is that of a small universe , the assumptions made are those which are expected theoretically for a large universe , and which have only been observationally supported under the assumption of simple - connectedness .",
    "if the universe is observably multiply connected , then the standard version of inflation can not quite be correct .",
    "even if inflation is retained to solve various problems , it would be surprising to expect that it would have resulted in exactly gaussian perturbation statistics with a harrison - zeldovich scale - free spectrum _ on the scale of the fundamental domain_. moreover , justifying the latter properties from a cobe data analysis under the assumption of simple - connectedness would not be valid .",
    "in fact , the articles claiming constraints from cobe data generally find that a small percentage of their perturbation simulations based on such assumptions are consistent with the cobe data , but do not examine what properties of the perturbations are required for small universe models and observations to be consistent .    here , the reader is just reminded of a few aspects of cosmological topology .",
    "a simple two - dimensional analogy for a space ( surface ) with a non - trivial topology is the 2-torus , @xmath31 which can be imagined equivalently either as    ( )    a torus placed in euclidean 3-space , @xmath13 but given an _ intrinsic _ metric such that the curvature is zero everywhere on the surface ; or as    a rectangle whose opposite sides are identified ; or as    an infinite grid of multiple copies of a single rectangle corresponding to multiple copies of a single physical space .",

    "a typical precision practical for the spectroscopic uncertainty is @xmath85 for an object such as a quasar , though much higher precision is possible . in that case",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the peculiar velocity . a conservative upper limit to the peculiar velocity , assuming the quasar to be at the centre of a typical galaxy ,",
    "can be taken as @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87    for a cluster of galaxies , spectroscopic redshifts could be found very precisely for individual galaxies , but a central velocity would have to be obtained from a fit to the distribution of the galaxies velocities , assuming isotropy of the peculiar velocities within the cluster . the x - ray velocity of the peak of the x - ray distribution would provide another way to estimate the true cluster redshift , inclusive of the peculiar velocity of the cluster as a whole .",
    "if two topological images of the cluster were at similar redshifts , as in the candidate identity suggested by @xcite , then as pointed out by @xcite , transverse velocities could be measured for the galaxies in the cluster , and it would be possible to derive a detailed dynamical model implying an even preciser cluster velocity .",
    "however , the peculiar velocity of the cluster as a whole would probably dominate the error . here , @xmath59 is adopted as a typical value .    for ` objects ' such as cold spots in the cmb @xcite , the uncertainty in the redshift would be related to the thickness of the sls .",

    "this corresponds to a comoving thickness of @xmath90      astrophysical objects at sub - horizon distances such as quasars and clusters of galaxies can have their angular positions measured much more precisely ( @xmath91 for quasars ; a few arcseconds for clusters if gravitational lensing is available ) than their cosmological redshifts .",
    "so , the error contributed to relative distance estimates is negligible relative to the error from redshift uncertainty .",
    "if identification of cobe cold spots with local superclusters were successful , then the poor angular resolution of cobe ( @xmath92 fwhm ) would introduce an uncertainty of @xmath93 in the tangential components at the redshift of the sls , so the total uncertainties @xmath94 and @xmath95 would be much larger than just @xmath96 and @xmath97    in contrast , planck and map , with expected resolutions of @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively , would provide good tangential constraints .",

    "we can consider a set of four objects at relative positions , neither aligned radially nor tangentially , as providing _ both _ the radial and tangential separation components as presented above . in that case , if there are a total of @xmath115 multiple topological images of a single object ( e.g. the brightest x - ray cluster known ) , these can be considered as @xmath136 independent sets of four images .",
    "label the maximum uncertainties for any such set of four images as @xmath137 and @xmath138    label the number of physically distinct objects , for which each has about @xmath115 multiple topological images identified , as @xmath139    then , the independence of gaussian errors implies a reduction in the uncertainties : @xmath140    the total number of galaxies visible to apparent magnitude limits of @xmath141 is @xmath142@xmath143 so , if @xmath70 is small enough that the majority of galaxies have at least four multiple images at epochs later than the galaxies formation epoch , then the ultimate precision in estimating the curvature parameters could reach around @xmath128@xmath129 , once all - sky redshift surveys with spectroscopy to a precision better than @xmath85 and complete to @xmath141 are performed .",
    "this is not attainable in the coming decade , but could be envisaged as a project for the new generation space telescope ( ngst ) .",
    "if our universe corresponds to a friedmann - lematre model , and if the hypothesis of a trivial topology is observably wrong , then the detection of multiple topological images would enable constraints on the curvature parameters from known astrophysical objects to be made as precisely as those presently expected for the planck and map satellites .",
    "the tangential separations give tighter constraints .",
    "sets of multiple topological images at redshifts @xmath2 would imply values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 preciser than @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . the precision available from the planck and map satellites for",
    "cmb ` objects ' cross - identified with low redshift objects would be similar .",
    "looking further into the future , an all sky spectroscopic survey by the ngst could lead to precision on a scale impressive by today s standards : @xmath128@xmath129 .",
    "observational cosmology would shift from the phase of working out the basics to that of high precision science .",
