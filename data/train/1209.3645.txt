    "holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) , originally conceived by zanardi and rasetti @xcite , has become one of the key approaches to perform robust quantum computation .",
    "the idea of hqc is based on the wilczek - zee holonomy @xcite that generalizes the berry phase @xcite to non - abelian ( non - commuting ) geometric phases accompanying adiabatic evolution .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that adiabatic quantum holonomies generically allow for universal quantum computation . different physical settings for adiabatic hqc have been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , universal hqc based on anandan s non - adiabatic non - abelian geometric phase @xcite has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this scheme allows for high - speed implementations of quantum gates ; a feature that can be particularly useful in solid - state devices , where qubits typically have short coherence time .",
    "non - adiabatic hqc can be made robust to a wide class of errors , such as decay , dephasing , and fluctuations in control parameters @xcite , and can be realized in decoherence free subspaces and noiseless subsystems insensitive to various collective errors @xcite .",
    "first experimental demonstrations of the scheme for universal non - adiabatic hqc proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite have been carried out for a superconducting qubit @xcite and in an nmr system @xcite .    here ,",
    "we develop a setting for conditional holonomic gates in a four - level configuration .",
    "we illustrate how non - adiabatic holonomic gates in our scheme can be implemented in solid state devices consisting of few - electron quantum dots @xcite and single - molecule magnets ( ssms ) @xcite , which are promising candidates for quantum computation @xcite . by utilizing the scalability of these systems ,",
    "the geometric nature of the proposed holonomic gates is a feature that may allow for robust and fast manipulations of a large number of qubits .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we demonstrate one- and two - qubit quantum gates based on non - adiabatic quantum holonomies .",
    "the scheme is based on a generic four - level model with off - diagonal @xmath0 couplings .",
    "realizations of the model in various kinds of solid - state devices are identified and examined in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementations ] .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusions .",
    "the general structure of our system is described by a four - dimensional effective state space whose dynamics is governed by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath1 in the ordered orthonormal basis @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is a complex - valued and time - independent @xmath4 matrix that satisfies @xmath5 , where the latter ensures that @xmath3 is invertible .",
    "the hamiltonian is turned on and off as described by the time - dependent scaling function @xmath6 .",
    "we demonstrate in the following how @xmath7 can be used for universal non - adiabatic hqc and how it can be realized in systems of four coupled quantum dots or in triangular molecular antiferromagnets .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) naturally splits the state space into two subspaces spanned by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "non - adiabatic holonomy transformations are realized if ( i ) the hamiltonian vanishes on each evolving subspace , and ( ii ) the projection operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 move in a cyclic fashion . condition ( i ) is satisfied since @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where the first equality follows from the fact that @xmath7 commutes with the time evolution operator @xmath14 . for condition ( ii )",
    ", we first note that since @xmath3 is assumed to be invertible , there is a unique singular value decomposition @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the positive and unitary parts , respectively . by using the singular value decomposition ,",
    "the time evolution operator can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath20 s is thus cyclic provided there is a @xmath21 such that @xmath22 . under this condition",
    "the holonomy matrices for the two subspaces @xmath13 read @xmath23 where @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the paths of the two subspaces spanned by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "these paths reside in the grassmannian manifold @xmath30 , being the space of all two - dimensional subspaces of the four - dimensional state space .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : holonomy ] ) that the holonomy is non - trivial if and only if @xmath31 .",
    "next , we encode the basis states in @xmath32 into the computational two - qubit states @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . running the hamiltonian @xmath7 along certain time intervals for appropriate choices of @xmath3",
    "provides a realization of holonomic conditional gates of the form @xmath37 where the holonomies @xmath38 and @xmath39 act on the target qubit conditionalized on the states @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , of the control qubit .",
    "one can see that by switching the roles of control and target qubits , which can be done by swapping the encoding of states @xmath42 and @xmath43 , holonomic conditional two - qubit gate of the form @xmath44 can be carried out .    we now verify that @xmath45 is sufficient for implementing a universal set of one- and two - qubit gates .",
    "the key observation is that any triplet @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be realized since @xmath3 is arbitrary up to the condition @xmath5 .",
    "first , by choosing @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , it follows that @xmath50 and @xmath45 reduces to the one - qubit holonomic gate @xmath51 with @xmath52 the pauli operators acting on the target qubit and @xmath53 a unit vector .",
    "any given @xmath53 , characterized by the spherical polar angles @xmath54 , can for instance be realized by choosing @xmath55 and @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 . by applying sequentially two such gates with different @xmath3 s corresponding to @xmath53 and @xmath59 yields @xmath60 , which is an arbitrary su(2 ) transformation acting on the target qubit .",
    "thus , our setup allows for arbitrary holonomic one - qubit gates .",
    "secondly , by choosing @xmath3 with @xmath61 and @xmath49 implements the holonomic conditional gate @xmath62 that may entangle the qubits .",
    "any entangling two - qubit gate is universal when assisted by arbitrary single - qubit transformations @xcite . in other words ,",
    "our scheme is universal .",
    "conceptually , the proposed holonomic conditional gate @xmath45 can be viewed as a non - abelian version of the abelian geometric phase shift gate developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the abelian case ,",
    "evolution is chosen such that two orthogonal qubit states @xmath40 and @xmath41 , say , pick up zero dynamical phases ( for instance , by parallel transporting @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , which implies that @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 being the aharonov - anandan ( aa ) geometric phase @xcite with @xmath66 the solid angle enclosed on the bloch sphere .",
    "this defines the aa geometric phase gate @xmath67 , @xmath68 . in our non - abelian scheme ,",
    "conditional two - qubit gate is implemented if there exist pair of loops @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the grassmannian manifold @xmath30 of the target qubit along which there is no dynamical phase .",
    "note that the orthogonal subspaces @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the state space of the target qubit when the control qubit is in the state @xmath40 or @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "zero dynamical contribution to the evolution of these two orthonormal subspaces is a signature of the geometric nature of our holonomic conditional two - qubit gate , just as zero dynamical phase in the abelian schemes @xcite is a signature of the geometric nature of the above aa gates .",
    "as possible physical implementations of the holonomic gates , we here discuss two settings involving four coupled quantum dots arranged in closed ring geometry .",
    "the first setting involves the well - known two - dimensional electron gas supported , e.g. , by a gaas / algaas heterostructure , depleted by a convenient set of top gate electrodes to form four quantum dots where electrons are confined .",
    "devices of this type can be routinely fabricated nowadays with state of the art electron beam lithography @xcite . in this system",
    ", electrons can tunnel from one dot to another with a tunnel coupling controlled individually by inter - dot gates .",
    "we also assume that the local potential , and hence the available single - particle energy levels in each quantum dot , can be individually manipulated with back gates .",
    "hqc is realized when this four - quantum - dot device contains just a single electron .",
    "if only one single - particle orbital in each quantum dot is relevant , the system can be described by a four - site tight - binding model , forming a closed ring .",

    "the @xmath76 are nearest - neighbor hopping parameters , which can be controlled by gate voltages .    in the presence of an external magnetic field",

    "furthermore , the magnetic field generates a gauge - invariant modification of the tight - binding hopping parameters via the peierls phase factors @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the integral of the vector potential along the hopping path from site @xmath72 to site @xmath82 .",
    "we fix the on - site energies @xmath83 by adjusting the voltage on the back gates of the device .",
    "we now assume that hopping parameters can be turned on and off with the same time - dependent scaling function @xmath6 by sweeping the top gates . in the invariant fock subspace spanned by the four ( spin - polarized ) one - electron states @xmath84 , the time dependent hamiltonian in this ordered basis has the form of eq .",

    "this shows the holonomies associated with this field - dependent tight - binding hamiltonian are gauge covariant quantities .    in order to take advantage of non - adiabaticity to control decoherence effects",
    ", the typical switching time @xmath96 should be as short as possible . at the same time",
    ", the action of the hamiltonian must be `` adiabatic '' enough to prevent transitions to higher orbital levels not included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian1 ] ) .",
    "this requirement is expressed by the condition @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the single - particle level spacing . for a quantum dot with a size of 100 nm , typically @xmath99 , which would permit @xmath96 to be as fast as 10 ps .",
    "this time is considerably shorter than the phase coherence time for charge qubits in quantum dots ( @xmath100 1 - 10 ns @xcite ) .      as the second setting to realize our scheme , we start again with the four - dot system introduced above , but we consider the case where four electrons are confined in the device .",
