    "auditory signal processing based on phenomenological models of human perception has helped to advance the modern technology of audio compression @xcite .",
    "it is of interest therefore to develop a systematic mathematical framework for sound signal processing based on models of the ear .",
    "the biomechanics of the inner ear ( cochlea ) lend itself well to mathematical formulation ( @xcite among others ) .",
    "such models can recover main aspects of the physiological data @xcite for simple acoustic inputs ( e.g. single frequency tones ) . in this paper",
    ", we study a nonlinear nonlocal model and associated numerical method for processing complex signals ( clicks and noise ) in the time domain .",
    "we also obtain a new spectrum of sound signals with nonlinear hearing characteristics which can be of potential interest for applications such as speech recognition .",
    "linear frequency domain cochlear models have been around for a long time and studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the cochlea , however , is known to have nonlinear characteristics , such as compression , two - tone suppression and combination tones , which are all essential to capture interactions of multi - tone complexes @xcite . in this nonlinear regime , it is more expedient to work in the time domain to resolve complex nonlinear frequency responses with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the nonlinearity in our model resides in the outer hair cells ( ohc s ) , which act as an amplifier to boost basilar membrane ( bm ) responses to low - level stimuli , so called active gain .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this type of nonlinearity is also nonlocal in nature , encouraging near neighbors on the bm to interact .",
    "one space dimensional transmission line models with nonlocal nonlinearities have been studied previously for auditory signal processing @xcite .",
    "higher dimensional models give sharper tuning curves and higher frequency selectivity . in section 2 ,",
    "we begin with a two space dimensional ( 2-d ) macromechanical partial differential equation ( pde ) model .",
    "we couple the 2-d model with the bm micromechanics of the active linear system in @xcite .",
    "we then make the gain parameter nonlinear and nonlocal to complete the model setup , and do analysis to simplify the model .",
    "in section 3 , we discretize the system and formulate a second order accurate finite difference scheme so as to combine efficiency and accuracy .",
    "the matrix we need to invert at each time step has a time - independent part ( passive ) and a time - dependent part ( active ) .",
    "in order to speed up computations , we split the matrix into the passive and active parts and devise an iterative scheme .",
    "we only need to invert the passive part once , thereby significantly speeding up computations .",
    "the structure of the system also allows us to reduce the complexity of the problem by a factor of two , giving even more computational efficiency .",
    "a proof of convergence of the iterative scheme is given in the appendix .",
    "in section 4 , we discuss numerical results and show that our model successfully reproduces the nonlinear effects such as compression , multi - tone suppression , and combination difference tones .",
    "we demonstrate such effects by inputing various signals into the model , such as pure tones , clicks and noise .",
    "a nonlinear spectrum is computed from the model and compared with fft spectrum for the acoustic input of a single tone plus gaussian white noise .",
    "the conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "the cochlea consists of an upper and lower fluid filled chamber , the scala vestibuli and scala tympani , with a shared elastic boundary called the basilar membrane ( bm ) ( see figure [ fig : coch ] ) .",
    "the bm acts like a fourier transform with each location on the bm tuned to resonate at a particular frequency , ranging from high frequency at the basal end to low frequency at the apical end .",
    "the acoustic wave enters the ear canal , where it vibrates the eardrum and then is filtered through the middle ear , transducing the wave from air to fluid in the cochlea via the stapes footplate . a traveling wave of fluid moves from the base to the apex , creating a skew - symmetric motion of the bm .",
    "the pressure difference drives the bm , which resonates according to the frequency content of the passing wave .",
    "we start with simplification of the upper cochlear chamber into a two dimensional rectangle @xmath0 \\times [ 0,h]$ ] ( see figure [ fig : coch ] ) . due to the symmetry",
    ", we can ignore the lower chamber .",
    "the bottom boundary ( @xmath1 ) is the bm , while the left boundary ( @xmath2 ) is the stapes footplate .",
    "the macromechanical equations are @xmath3,\\ z \\in [ 0,h],\\ t \\in [ 0,\\infty ) \\\\",
    "p_{x}(0,z , t ) = { t_{\\mathrm{m}}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}}(t),\\ \\ p(l , z , t ) = 0 \\\\               p_{z}(x,0,t ) = 2\\rho u_{tt},\\ \\ p_{z}(x , h , t ) = 0             \\end{array }    \\right .",

    "the middle ear amplification function is given by @xmath13 . in our case ,",
    "based on guinan and peake @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the middle ear characteristic frequency and @xmath16 is the middle ear damping ratio .",
    "thus , for @xmath17 , where c.c .",
    "is complex conjugate , we have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .    for more complex stimuli , it is useful to model the middle ear in the time domain as a one - degree of freedom spring - mass system .",
    "the equivalent time domain formulation of the steady state middle ear is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is stapes displacement and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mass , damping and stiffness of the middle ear .",
    "the stapes boundary condition in ( [ eq : macro ] ) is replaced by @xmath25 one of the interesting effects of using the time domain middle ear model is that it reduces the dispersive instability in the cochlea ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that the steady state middle ear model ignores important transient effects and phase shifts that help to reduce the shock to the cochlea .    at the helicotrema @xmath26",
    ", we have used the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath27 . in @xcite , they used an absorbing boundary condition @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a positive constant @xcite .",
    "other models use the neumann condition @xmath30 .",
    "it has been stated that the frequency domain solutions are minimally affected by which boundary condition is chosen @xcite , and thus we have chosen the simpler dirichlet condition .",
    "however , interesting results on choosing the best initial conditions to minimize transient effects ( dispersive instability ) has been shown in @xcite using the neumann condition .",
    "to summarize , the macromechanics consist of equations ( [ eq : macro])([eq : bcmear ] ) .",
    "this is a resonant tectorial membrane model based on @xcite .",

    "a compressive nonlinearity in the model is necessary to capture effects such as two - tone suppression and combination tones .",
    "also , to allow for smoother bm profiles , we make the active gain nonlocal .",
    "thus we have @xmath47 and gain @xmath48 where @xmath49 are constants .      solving the pressure laplace equation on the rectangle using separation of variables , we arrive at @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 substituting ( [ eq : sov ] ) into ( [ eq : force ] ) and then discretizing ( [ eq : active ] ) in space into @xmath53 grid points , we have @xmath54 where @xmath55\\ ] ] @xmath56\\ ] ] @xmath57\\ ] ] @xmath58\\ ] ] @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are now block diagonal , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 . also , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the numbers @xmath70 are numerical integration weights in the discretization of ( [ eq : integral ] ) and are chosen based on the desired degree of accuracy .",
    "note that we can write @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is symmetric and positive definite .",
    "the result of separation of variables produced the matrix @xmath74 , which is essentially the mass of fluid on the bm and _ dynamically couples _ the system .",
    "in formulating a numerical method , we note that the matrices in ( [ eq : disc ] ) can be split into a time - independent passive part and a time - dependent active part . in splitting in this way , we are able to formulate an iterative scheme where we only need to do one matrix inversion on the passive part for the entire simulation .",
    "thus , using second order approximations of the first and second derivates in ( [ eq : disc ] ) , we arrive at @xmath75 where superscript @xmath76 denotes discrete time , @xmath77 denotes iteration and @xmath78 @xmath79\\ ] ] @xmath80 proof of convergence will follow naturally from the next discussion .",
    "notice that this is a @xmath81 system .",

    "then , since the same term appears in both equations ( [ eq : iter1 ] ) and ( [ eq : iter2 ] ) , for each @xmath77 we only have to do 1 @xmath82 matrix solve . in practice ,",
    "since @xmath98 is symmetric , positive definite and _ time - independent _ , we compute the cholesky factorization of @xmath98 at the start of the simulation and use the factorization for more efficient matrix solves at each step . as a side note ,",
    "if we subtract ( [ eq : iter2 ] ) from ( [ eq : iter1 ] ) , we have one equation for the ohc displacement @xmath42 .",
    "we start with a modification of the parameters in @xcite ( see table [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "it is known that higher dimensional models give higher sensitivity .",
    "this is the case with this model .",
    "the 1-d model @xcite gives a 90 db active gain at 16 khz , whereas the 2-d model gives a 160 db active gain .",
    "thus , we need to tune the system to reduce the gain .",
    "there are many ways to do this , and the method we choose is to increase all the damping coefficients in the table by the following : @xmath99    .model parameters in cgs units [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      in an isocontour plot , a probe is placed at a specific location on the bm where the time response is measured and analyzed for input tones covering a range of frequencies .",
    "figure [ fig : sens ] shows isointensity curves for @xmath100 , which corresponds to @xmath101 .",
    "the characteristic place ( cp ) for a frequency is defined as the location on the bm of maximal response from a pure tone of that frequency in the fully linear active model ( @xmath102 ) . the characteristic frequency ( cf ) at a bm location is the inverse of this map .",
    "the left plot is the linear steady state active case .",
    "the parameter is the active gain @xmath103 , and for each value of the active gain we get a curve that is a function of the input frequency .",
    "the value of this function is the ratio @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is bm displacement at the characteristic place and @xmath106 is pressure at the eardrum .",
    "this is known as sensitivity .",
    "it is basically an output / input ratio and gives the transfer characteristics of the ear at that particular active level .",
    "notice that when @xmath102 , the bm at the characteristic place is most sensitive at the corresponding characteristic frequency , but at lower values of the gain , the sensitivity peak shifts to lower frequencies .",
    "analogously , the second plot in figure [ fig : sens ] shows isointensity curves for the nonlinear time domain model where now the parameter is the intensity of the input stimulus in db spl ( sound pressure level ) . for the time domain ,",
    "we measure the root - mean - square bm amplitude from 5 ms ( to remove transients ) up to a certain time @xmath107 .",
    "note that for high - intensity tones , the model becomes passive while low - intensity tones give a more active model .",
    "this shows _",
    "compression_. again , there is a frequency shift of the sensitivity peak ( about one - half octave ) from low to high - intensity stimuli in agreement with @xcite , so called half - octave shift .",
    "the plot agrees well with figure 5 in @xcite .",
    "the first non - sinusoidal input we look at is a click . in the experiment in the left plot of figure [ fig :",
    "click ] , we put probes at varying characteristic places associated with frequencies ranging from 0.5 - 4 khz to measure the time series bm displacement .",
    "the click was 40 db with duration 0.1 ms starting at 0.4 ms .",
    "all responses were normalized to amplitude 1 .",
    "the plot is similar to figure 4 in @xcite . in the right plot of figure",
    "[ fig : click ] , a probe was placed at cp for 6.4 khz and the time series bm volume velocity was recorded for various intensities and the sensitivity plotted .",
    "this shows , similar to figure [ fig : sens ] , the compression effects at higher intensities .",
    "see figure 9 in @xcite for a similar plot .",
    "the second non - sinusoidal input we explore is gaussian white noise .",
    "figure [ fig : noise ] is similar in all regards to figure [ fig : click ] .",
    "notice again in the right plot the compression effect .",
    "any nonlinear system with multiple sinusoidal inputs will create difference tones .",
    "if two frequencies @xmath108 and @xmath109 are put into the ear , @xmath110 will be created at varying intensities , where @xmath76 and @xmath111 are nonnegative integers .",
    "the cubic difference tone , denoted @xmath112 , where @xmath113 , is the most prominent .",
    "figure [ fig : cdt ] contains three plots of one experiment .",
    "the experiment consists of two sinusoidal tones , 7 and 10 khz at 80 db each .",
    "the cubic difference tone is 4 khz .",
    "the plot on the left is the bm profile for the experiment at 15 ms .",
    "we see combination tone peaks at 1.21 cm ( cp for 4 khz ) , 1.54 cm ( cp for 2 khz ) and 1.85 cm ( cp for 1 khz ) .",
    "the middle plot shows the snapshot at 15 ms of the active gain parameter , showing the difference tones getting an active boost . finally , the right plot is a spectrum plot of the time series for bm displacement at 1.21 cm , the characteristic place for 4 khz .",
    "the cubic difference tone is above 1 nm and can therefore be heard .",
    "two - tone ( and multi - tone ) suppression is characteristic of a compressive nonlinearity and has been recognized in the ear @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : supp ] illustrates two - tone suppression and is a collection of isodisplacement curves that show decreased tuning in the presence of suppressors and is similar to figure 16 in @xcite .",
    "we placed a probe at the cp for 4 khz ( 1.21 cm ) and input sinusoids of various frequencies . at each frequency , we record the pressure at the eardrum that gives a 1 nm displacement for 4 khz in the fft spectrum of the time series response at cp .",
    "the curve without suppressors is dashed with circles .",
    "we then input each frequency again , but this time in the presence of a low side ( 0.5 khz ) tone and high side ( 7.5 khz ) tone , both at 80 db .",
    "notice the reduced tuning at the cf . also notice the asymmetry of suppression , which shows low side is more suppressive than high side , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "for multi - tone suppression , we look at tonal suppression of noise . in figure",
    "[ fig : multisupp ] , for each plot , a probe was placed at every grid point along the bm and the time response was measured from 15 ms up to 25 ms .",
    "the signal in each consisted of noise at 50 db with a 2 khz tone ranging from 40 db to 80 db ( top to bottom ) .",
    "an fft was performed for each response and its characteristic frequency amplitude was recorded and plotted in decibels relative to the average of the response spectrum of 0 db noise from 0.5 - 16 khz .",
    "we see suppression of all frequencies , with again low - side suppression stronger than high - side suppression .",
    "figure [ fig : multisupp ] is qualitatively similar to figure 3 in @xcite .",
    "it is useful to compare this figure with figure [ fig : multisuppfft ] .",
    "this figure is the same as figure [ fig : multisupp ] , except we do an fft of the input signal at the eardrum .",
    "comparing these two figures shows that we have a new spectral transform that can be used in place of an fft in certain applications , for example signal recognition and noise suppression .",
    "we studied a two - dimensional nonlinear nonlocal variation of the linear active model in @xcite .",
    "we then developed an efficient and accurate numerical method and used this method to explore nonlinear effects of multi - tone sinusoidal inputs , as well as clicks and noise .",
    "we showed numerical results illustrating compression , multi - tone suppression and difference tones .",
    "the model reached agreement with experiments @xcite and produced a novel nonlinear spectrum . in future work",
    ", we will analyze the model responses to speech and resulting spectra for speech recognition .",
    "it is also interesting to study the inverse problem @xcite of finding efficient and automated ways to tune the model to different physiological data .",
    "applying the model to psychoacoustic signal processing @xcite will be another fruitful line of inquiry .",
    "the work was partially supported by nsf grant itr-0219004 .",
    "j. x. would like to acknowledge a fellowship from the john simon guggenheim memorial foundation , and a faculty research assignment award at ut austin .",
