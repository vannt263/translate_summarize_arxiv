    "there has recently been a great deal of new data obtained at hera for the structure function @xmath0 at small @xmath4 @xcite , and consequently a great deal of theoretical activity .",
    "the main theoretical question is whether one should include leading @xmath3 terms which cause small @xmath4 enhancement of terms at high orders in @xmath2 , and if so , then in precisely what manner .",
    "common wisdom was that such terms should not be included because standard ways of doing so showed that the terms were indeed important for the ranges of @xmath4 and @xmath5 probed at hera , but that they worsened global fits to data obtained from conventional lo and nlo approaches , rather than improved them .",
    "indeed , the best global fits to data seemed to come from nlo evolution starting at @xmath6 where the input for the singlet quark distribution ( weighted by @xmath4 ) , and hence the structure function , behaved like @xmath7 at small @xmath4 @xcite . thus , despite the good quality of the global fits , the situation was unsatisfactory since terms were ignored because they were inconvenient , rather than for any sound theoretical reason , and the required input for the quark distribution was of a rather steep , unjustified form .",
    "recently i proposed that a correct theoretical treatment of the calculation of structure functions demands that the leading powers of @xmath2 for given powers of @xmath3 must be included , but in expressions for physical quantities@xcite .",
    "this latter point was inspired by , and is similar to the idea of using physical anomalous dimensions proposed by catani @xcite .",
    "however , the structure imposed by an ordered expansion within a given renormalization scheme has a number of other consequences for the form of the expressions for structure functions .",
    "i will discuss the leading  order  renormalization  scheme  consistent ( lorsc ) calculation of structure functions briefly before looking at comparison with experiment .",
    "the principles underlying the calculation and the consequences are :    \\1 .",
    "the quantities one calculates to a given order are directly observable .",
    "hence rather than coefficient functions and parton distributions the structure function is factorized into inputs at some scale @xmath8 and evolution away from this scale .",
    "one obvious consequence of this is factorization scheme independence .",
    "\\2 . for a physical quantity",
    "the leading  order expression for each independent component begins at its lowest power of @xmath2 , whatever power that happens to be , e.g. if a term of @xmath9 appears for the first time at order @xmath10 this is the leading  order term for @xmath4-dependence of this type . in practice",
    "this is implemented in moment space where the leading power in @xmath2 for each inverse power of the moment variable @xmath11 is part of the full leading  order expression .",
    "as it must , this results in leading  order expressions which are renormalization scheme independent and which are therefore compatible with the use of the one  loop running coupling .    \\3 .",
    "the inputs for the structure functions are two fundamental nonperturbative functions , one each for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , convoluted with perturbative contributions .",
    "the nonperturbative functions are taken to be flat at small @xmath4 .",
    "the perturbative parts are determined so that the total expression for the structure function is independent of the choice of starting scale , i.e. the lorsc expression is invariant under changes of @xmath8 up to changes beyond leading order .",
    "this determines the inputs uniquely up to a scale , @xmath14 , which should be typical of the onset of nonperturbative physics . for both @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "the inputs are required to behave roughly like @xmath15 for @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the forms of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are all related at small @xmath4 , and once one of them is set ( in practice @xmath19 ) by fitting to data there is very little freedom in the others , a constraint largely absent in conventional approaches .",
    "these points are discussed in far greater detail in @xcite , and the way in which they are put into practice is presented in the latter of these papers .",
    "the fit using the lorsc expressions is performed with the parameters specifying the form of the nonperturbative inputs and the nonperturbative scale left free , and is repeated for a wide variety of input scales @xmath8 .",
    "the best fit comes from @xmath21 , but is very insensitive to @xmath22 for values from @xmath23 .",
    "we find that @xmath24 , precisely the sort of value expected .",
    "the charm and bottom quarks are dealt with rather naively , treated as massless above threshold ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively ) and playing no role below this .",
    "the charm threshold is chosen to give a reasonable description of data on the charm structure function .",
    "@xmath5 is chosen as the ( squared ) renormalization scale , and the value of @xmath27 is held fixed at @xmath28 ( giving @xmath29 at one loop ) , though this is certainly close to the best fit value .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the conventional nlo fit is performed in the usual manner and the input scale for the parton distributions @xmath30 is chosen to be the same as that for the charm threshold ( @xmath31 ) . for the best fit",
    "we find that @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 . the input quark distribution @xmath34",
    ". the conventional lo fit is performed in the same way with charm threshold of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , ( one  loop @xmath37 ) , and small @xmath4 quark @xmath38 .",
    "the results of these more conventional fits are also shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "prompt photon data . ]",
    "ldddd @xmath4-range & data points & lorsc @xmath39 & nlo @xmath39 & lo @xmath39 + @xmath40 & 551 & 622 & 615 & 605 + @xmath41 & 548 & 483 & 554 & 598 + total & 1099 & 1105 & 1169 & 1203 +    in each case the values of @xmath0 used for the hera data are not simply those published but are corrected for the values of @xmath1 predicted in each of the fits . for the lorsc fit this causes a slight lowering of @xmath0 for some points due to smaller predicted @xmath1 which in fact improves the fit to the small @xmath4 data by a @xmath39 of about 5 .",
    "for the nlo fit there is essentially no correction , but for the lo fit the predicted @xmath1 is extremely large since the fit requires both a large coupling and large gluon at small @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the values of @xmath0 are corrected upwards , sometimes by @xmath42 , leading to the correct lo fit being @xmath43 worse than a fit to uncorrected data . , while for the lorsc fit it is @xmath44 . in each case",
    "the normalization of the zeus data is @xmath45 higher . ]    as one can see the lorsc fit is clearly superior : although the difference in quality is @xmath46 per point this is significant when considering 1099 data points .",
    "indeed , the difference between the quality of the lorsc fit and the nlo fit is larger than that between the nlo and lo fits .",
    "the quality in terms of different experiments may be found in the second of@xcite ( as may the references for the experiments ) , but it is illustrative to present it in terms of two bins in @xmath4 .",
    "there is little difference in the quality of the high@xmath4 fits , as we would expect since at high @xmath4 the missing @xmath3 terms in the lo and nlo fits cause no problems ( and an appropriate choice of coupling makes the lo fit as good as the nlo fit ) .",
    "in fact , the lorsc calculation is missing nlo @xmath2 terms , and should perhaps be a little worse than the nlo fit .",
    "data only : the lorsc fit only improves by a few points , but the nlo fit improves to 578 , with @xmath47 .",
    "such a low value of @xmath48 is not allowed in the full nlo fit since it leads to a very poor fit at small @xmath4 .",
    "] however , at small @xmath4 there is a very clear deterioration in the quality of fit going from lorsc to nlo to lo ( which would be even greater if values of @xmath49 consistent with the best high@xmath4 fits were used ) .",
    "this is due to the loss of vital @xmath3 terms as ones goes from lorsc to nlo , and also , to a lesser extent , when going from nlo to lo .",
    "hence , the results of the fits are precisely as we would expect from theoretical arguments . they clearly imply that in determining values of @xmath50 and the gluon distribution in particular schemes the nlo fit should only be trusted at relatively high @xmath4 .    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig ] is the comparison of the predictions for @xmath1 made using the best fit from the lorsc approach and the nlo approach .",
    "as one can see there is significant difference between them , and any relatively accurate measurement of @xmath1 should see some sign of which approach is preferred .",
    "the `` determination '' of @xmath1 by h1 is no use in differentiating between the two since it is really just a consistency check . if one assumes that the h1 nlo fit is correct and extrapolates from low @xmath51 , where the determination of @xmath0 from the cross  section is insensitive to @xmath1 then the difference between the measured cross  section and the extrapolation provides a value of @xmath1@xcite",
    "this must be consistent with the nlo prediction for @xmath1 , which it is .",
    "however , assuming that the lorsc calculation is correct the extrapolation is different , and hence so is the determined @xmath1 .",
    "consistency between the determined @xmath1 and the prediction is also good in this case .",
    "prompt photon data and moderate@xmath4 charm data , and it would be illustrative to repeat the process with a more constrained nlo fit",
    ". it would also be interesting to use all available high @xmath52 data , i.e. also include zeus data . such a study is being performed . ] hence , a true measurement of @xmath1 would be an invaluable aid to the determination of the real physics describing hadron interactions at small @xmath4 .",
    "an important role may also be played by improved data on the charm structure function , and incorporating heavy quarks correctly into the lorsc approach is a project well underway .",
    "less inclusive quantities may well also play an important part , but calculations remain to be done .",
    "a comparison to all significant data gives clear evidence that the lorsc calculation of structure functions is preferred to the usual nlo ",
    "in@xmath2 approach .",
    "thus , although the usual expansion technique seems to be acceptable at small @xmath4 at present , and will probably be used for most qcd calculations in the near future , when attempting to describe any data at small @xmath4 it should be borne in mind that this approach may well be untrustworthy : anomalies may occur , and more careful calculations may be needed .",
    "the situation will be clarified by a variety of different small @xmath4 measurements .",
