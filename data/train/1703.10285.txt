    "dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies are commonly known as dynamically static and morphologically elliptical stellar systems . owing to their numerous population in galaxy clusters ,",
    "they are often considered as an important key to probe the formation history of clusters . as indicated by their name , they are old and small galaxies showing no sign of recent or current star formation . however , the discovery of two - armed spirals in vcc856 ( or ic3328 ) , a de in the virgo cluster , by @xcite has raised a controversy as to whether des are young and rotationally supported or old and anisotropic stellar systems .",
    "there have since been many follow - up studies on the hidden properties of des @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite performed a systematics search on 476 early - type dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster , finding that about one tenth of the des possess a disk component and that some of them even possess disk features such as spiral , bar , and lens .",
    "the fraction of the des with a disk component increases by more than 50@xmath1 at the bright end of the de population , and such des are reclassified as dedis or des(di ) @xcite .",
    "this implies that dedi galaxies are distinct from common des , probably originating from genuine disk galaxies .",
    "moreover , based on photometric studies , 15@xmath1 of des are found with blue centers , indicating that those galaxies recently lost their gas by either ram - pressure stripping or harassment @xcite . in terms of the clustering properties and spatial distribution ,",
    "dedis closely follow the spatial distribution of spiral populations rather than that of common des @xcite .",
    "based on these studies , @xcite suggested that progenitors of dedis are infalling , gaseous dwarf disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite reported that some des , including vcc856 , are found with a significant amount of rotation . among the kinematic data of 21 des presented in @xcite , the averaged rotation curve of rotationally supported des is similar to that of late - type galaxies at a given magnitude . by comparing the boxiness / diskiness and the anisotropic parameter",
    ", @xcite showed that the isophotes of dedis tend to be diskier and more rotationally supported , supporting the idea that their progenitors are disk galaxies . using the scaling relations such as @xmath2-velocity dispersion and fundamental plane",
    ", @xcite further concluded that some des are rather similar to late - type galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the offset between des and ellipticals in the faber - jackson relation supports the idea that des are not dominated by dark matter that takes @xmath3 of the total mass within the effective radius ( see also @xcite ) . by showing that 28 des are fast rotators among 39 virgo des and contain disk - like structures",
    ", @xcite also suggested that such des likely originate from late - type galaxies that lost their gas by ram - pressure stripping while infalling from the outside .",
    "based on the morphological features and the sersic fitting of density profiles , @xcite classified the virgo des into four different groups , namely , one - component , two - component , population with lens , and barred population .",
    "they showed that , among the dedis , the barred population is @xmath4 while the lens population is @xmath5 .",
    "lenses are known as ` defunct bars ' @xcite because they have density profiles similar to bars , but shorter major axis .",
    "although these barred populations take nearly a half of the entire virgo dedis , their origin remains mysterious .",
    "observations indicate that there is a considerable number of barred dedis at the outskirts of the virgo cluster @xcite . using @xmath0-body simulations ,",
    "@xcite recently showed that the tidal potential in a virgo - like cluster can trigger the bar formation in massive disk galaxies after the pericenter approach .",
    "however , since the orbits are unknown , it is not certain whether observed barred dedis at the cluster outskirts have been subject to stronger tidal perturbations .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to show that the bar formation in dedis does not require a tidal forcing : they are intrinsically unstable to forming bars .    the bar formation in disk galaxies is usually explained by dynamical instabilities of self - gravitating , axisymmetric stellar disks @xcite .",
    "there are certainly many factors that affect the stability of disk galaxies , including the mass of dark matter halo @xcite , a fraction of counter - rotating stars in the disk @xcite , and disk thickness @xcite .",
    "for example , it is well known that the dark halo plays a dual role : a massive spheroidal component alleviates disks against forming bar - like structures @xcite , while a responsive halo destabilizes the system by allowing angular momentum transfer from the disk to halo and thus expedites the bar growth @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 of the total disk mass is frequently observed to be in the counter rotation @xcite , possibly caused in numerical simulations by gas infall with opposite spins and/or minor mergers @xcite .",
    "these counter - rotating stellar components tend to stabilize the disk by making its center hotter @xcite , as well as by lowering its rotational kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "since most of the previous studies mentioned above considered normal disk galaxies , in this work we focus on dwarf disk galaxies , mimicking vcc856 in the virgo cluster , and study how galaxy properties change the intrinsic stability of dedis against the bar formation .",
    "once a bar forms , it undergoes another transition in the vertical direction called buckling instability .",
    "it partially weakens and shortens the bar by disrupting its outer parts @xcite .",
    "observationally , @xcite caught the buckling instability in action in two nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite emphasized that adopting a live halo is crucial to exploring the buckling instability .",
    "the buckling instability is also known as a formation channel of a boxy / peanut / x - shaped bulge @xcite .",
    "the local theory of @xcite and @xcite suggests that the buckling instability occurs when the ratio @xmath7 exceeds @xmath8 when the disk is uniform , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the velocity dispersions in the vertical and radial directions , respectively .",
    "however , the ratio varies with radius in real galaxies , so that one single threshold can not determine the occurrence of buckling instability @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite reported that the buckling instability is recurrent due to the regrowth of bars .",
    "multiple renewals of bars with repeated destruction and formation helped by gas accretion were investigated by @xcite , but the condition for regrowth in isolation is not well understood yet .",
    "in this paper , we run @xmath0-body simulations of dwarf disk galaxies to study their long - term dynamical evolution in isolation .",
    "we construct galaxy models that resemble vcc865 , which is thought to be an infalling progenitor of dedis .",
    "the primary purposes of this work are to understand what it is that forms bars in dedis and to see how differently dedis evolve as compared to normal disk galaxies .",
    "we also vary galaxy properties within observational error ranges to explore the effects of the counter streaming motion , velocity dispersion , disk scale height , dark matter fraction , and stellar disk mass on the bar formation and recurrent buckling instability occurring in isolated dwarf disk galaxies .    the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ s : ch2 ] , we describe our galaxy models and numerical methods . in section",
    "[ s : ch3 ] , we present the detailed evolution of our fiducial model in terms of the size , strength , and pattern speed of a bar that forms . in section [ s : ch4 ] , we explore the effects of the various parameters on the bar formation and buckling instability . in section [ s :",
    "ch5 ] , we summarize and discuss our results in an astronomical context .",
    "in this section , we describe our galaxy models and simulation methods .",
    "we first justify that vcc856 can be a progenitor galaxy in view of its kinematics and morphology .",
    "we then explain our initial conditions and model parameters as well as the numerical methods we adopt .      as an initial condition of our simulations",
    ", it is ideal to choose a dwarf disk galaxy that maximally represents the infalling population without undergoing environmental effects . among numerous dedis in the virgo cluster ,",
    "we take vcc856 as our fiducial progenitor galaxy for the following reasons .",
    "the morphological classification of vcc856 was a nucleated de in @xcite , but @xcite first reported the presence of faint logarithmic spiral arms after subtracting mean axisymmetric light distribution .",
    "the pitch angle of the spirals is @xmath11 , similar to those in sb or sbc galaxies . for this disk feature",
    ", vcc856 was reclassified as a dedi or de(di ) by @xcite , and its properties have been inspected observationally in the literature @xcite .",
    "the photometric data show that the surface brightness profile of vcc856 follows an exponential distribution without a bulge @xcite , implying that it has not yet experienced any major mergers .",
    "if a bulgeless dwarf disk galaxy has experienced either strong tidal effects or mergers , it would probably have a bar or non - exponential density profile .",
    "in addition , unlike early - type galaxies that are commonly pressure - supported , vcc856 is a rotationally supported system @xcite , which strengthens our assumption that vcc856 is a genuine dwarf disk galaxy . finally , it is a nearly gas free galaxy and lacks prominent regions @xcite , suggesting that it has entered the virgo cluster relatively recently and has experienced ram - pressure stripping without considerable influence on its stellar disk .",
    "although it already possesses spiral arms presumably driven by a weak tidal encounter , the fractional arm amplitude is only @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we regard vcc856 as an infalling progenitor that preserves the information of the early phase of the infalling dwarf disk galaxies .",
    "vcc886 is one of the best studied dedis with sufficient information available for numerical modeling .",
    "our galaxy models , mimicking vcc856 , consist of a stellar disk and a live halo .",
    "although the presence of a nucleus in vcc856 is apparent ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we do not include it in our models since its size is too small to affect global dynamics of the stellar disk .",
    "for the dark halo , we adopt the @xcite profile @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the radial distance , @xmath15 is the total mass , and @xmath16 is the scale radius of the halo . the scale radius is related to the concentration parameter @xmath17 as @xmath18^{1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath19 being the virial radius @xcite . for all models ,",

    "we find no evidence of spirals in the other models .",
    "the primary reason may be that their bars always reside within the cr , indicating that a bar should be sufficiently long to form manifold - driven spirals .",

    "the main results of the present work can be summarized as follows .",
    "we find that most of our galaxy models are dynamically unstable to forming a bar .",
    "only when galaxies have an excessively concentrated halo or a hot disk do they remain stable without forming a bar .",
    "this suggests that infalling dwarf disk galaxies are _ intrinsically unstable _ to bar formation even without tidal forcing .",
    "our results explain the presence of dedis with a bar component at the outskirts of virgo cluster @xcite where the tidal force by the cluster potential appears too weak to produce a bar @xcite .",
    "the mean formation time before the first buckling is found to be @xmath229 gyr , indicating that the progenitors of dedis slowly form a bar .",
    "except for two highly unstable models that have no counter streaming motion or low @xmath40 , the bar formation in our dedis models does not occur rapidly during their evolution in isolation .",
    "our standard model is marginally unstable to forming a bar after @xmath230 .",
    "this may allow feasible time for the formation of very weak spiral arms in vcc 856 via either swing amplification or weak tidal force from the neighboring galaxies , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we defer further discussion regarding the spiral structure of vcc 856 and dedis to the next paper of this series .    the bar formation time and",
    "its strength depend on the galaxy properties : a bar is stronger and forms earlier in galaxies with lower fraction of counter - streaming disk particles , lower halo concentration , lower velocity anisotropy @xmath231 , smaller scale height of a disk , and/or more massive disk . in particular , the ratio of the velocity dispersions , @xmath193 , is directly related to the disk stability and the onset of buckling instability .",
    "a disk with a higher @xmath194 is initially more stable to bar formation and can be subject to the buckling instability even without forming a bar since @xmath193 is closer to the threshold value . consistently with the results of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a bar formed in models with larger @xmath193 is thus wider , weaker , and inefficient in transferring the bar angular momentum to the halo .",
    "interestingly , we also find that , despite variations in disk mass , the disk - halo systems with nearly the same @xmath52 and @xmath40 within @xmath232 undergo a similar evolutionary path .",
    "for instance , a more massive disk that is more unstable can be stabilized by increasing the fraction of counter - streaming particles in order to keep @xmath52 and @xmath40 more or less the same .",
    "such a combination of the destabilizing effect of disk mass and the stabilizing effect of counter - streaming motions makes the bar formation time in model m1 with a massive disk almost identical to that in model m2 with a less massive disk .        as predicted by linear theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the exchange of angular momentum between the disk and the halo plays an important role in shaping the dynamical properties of our galaxy models such as the bar growth and pattern speed .",
    "as a bar loses its angular momentum to the halo , it becomes stronger and its pattern speed decreases .",
    "consequently , the bar growth rate and its slowdown rate are larger in models with lower velocity anisotropy @xmath63 or less counter streaming motions . additionally , we find that thinner and more massive disks are more unstable and form a stronger bar , which efficiently transfers the angular momentum and thus rapidly slows down at least until the onset of buckling instability , if the surrounding halo is sufficiently massive .",
    "model dm1 with @xmath233 is highly unstable to rapidly form a bar : however , due to a small amount of angular momentum transfer , it takes longer to undergo buckling instability relative to model v1 .",
    "the left panels of figure [ fig18sum ] summarize our numerical results for the time @xmath234 when the bar is maximized before the first buckling instability , the maximum bar strength @xmath235 , and the bar pattern speed as functions of the minimum value @xmath236 of the toomre stability parameter for the models with the buckling instability . except for v models , a model with smaller @xmath236 forms a stronger bar at an earlier time .",
    "we find that the degeneracy of @xmath236 on @xmath234 and @xmath235 for v models can easily be removed by considering the amount of counter - streaming motion in the abscissa as @xmath237 , as plotted in the right panels .",
    "the dashed lines are the best fits : @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 .",
    "the buckling instability appears to be quite common at least in barred dedis , as it occurs in 11 of our 15 galaxy models .",
    "it shortens and thickens a bar by instantaneously warping it in a u or v shape when the velocity anisotropy @xmath7 exceeds a threshold value at a given radius , as in normal disk galaxies @xcite . in the v and dp models with the same density structure , the threshold value is @xmath241 at @xmath148 , which is similar to the value reported by @xcite for normal disk galaxies .",

    "they argued that the disk scale height is related to the phase - space density as @xmath243 and to the jeans mass as @xmath244 , making a disk with smaller @xmath45 more unstable .",
    "these results are in good agreement with ours in terms of the epochs of bar formation and buckling instability , but are seemingly contradictory in terms of a tendency of bar slowdown . in @xcite , a thin - disk bar ( @xmath245 ) barely slows down , resulting in a 2.5 times larger pattern speed than the thicker counterpart ( @xmath246 ) at @xmath211 gyr , whereas , in our study , the thin - disk bar ( model h1 ) slows down more significantly than a thicker counterpart ( model s1 ) .",
    "we attribute this inconsistency to the early onset of the buckling instability in the thin - disk bar of @xcite . more specifically ,",
    "their thin - disk model with @xmath247 is highly unstable to undergoing vigorous buckling instability before the bar grows full and long enough for an efficient angular momentum transfer .",
    "our thin - disk model h1 with @xmath205 is even thicker than their thickest - disk model @xmath246 with @xmath248 , and the evolutions of these two models are similar to one another in terms of the buckling time and bar slowdown .",
    "while we study the evolution of dwarf disk galaxies , some of our results can be applicable to normal disk galaxies , at least qualitatively . for instance , model v1 presented in section [ s : ch4v ] follows an evolutionary path similar to a milky way - sized disk galaxy in @xcite . both undergo more than one buckling instability , and the times of the recurrent buckling instabilities are similar .",
    "the ellipticity variations are also similar ( see fig .  [ fig09v2](a ) and ( b ) in the present work and their fig .  4 ) . in addition , the face - on view at 7 gyr of model v1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10face ] ) closely resembles the image with an ansae at 9.9 gyr ( their fig .",
    "however , unlike the bar in model v1 , the bar in their model keeps growing in size after the second buckling instability .",
    "other than this minor difference , their evolution histories are almost alike .",
    "the formation of barred spirals and inner stellar rings observed in milky way - sized galaxies @xcite is also found in model v1 without counter - streaming motions ( see fig .  [ fig12ring ] ) .",
    "model v1 is very unstable to rapidly forming a bar and transfers a significant amount of bar angular momentum to the halo .",
    "this allows the bar to grow longer than others to beyond the cr , triggering the ejection of stars at the bar ends and forming spiral patterns in a trailing shape @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum transfer occurs even after the buckling instability , which eventually aids the formation of an inner stellar ring . as we find that the increase in the central enclosed mass is correlated with the angular momentum transfer , the mass inflow rate at @xmath123 in model v1 is 1.6 times higher than our standard model during the post - buckling era .",
    "this allows the cavities at the sides of the bar to grow larger to transform the disk into a @xmath190 shape .",
    "a bar formed in dwarf disk galaxies is subject to multiple buckling instabilities that vertically heat the disk .",
    "the first buckling episode that occurs at relatively smaller radii ( 1@xmath2493@xmath28 ) often forms a peanut bulge and vertically stabilizes the central regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the secondary bucklings occur at relatively larger radii ( @xmath250 ) , so only the outer parts are thickened by the vertical heating , forming an x - shaped bulge .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , who investigated the recurrent buckling instability in milky way - sized galaxies and suggested that an x - shaped bulge is evidence of recurrent buckling .",
    "models where the secondary buckling is relatively mild form a faint x - shaped bulge ( e.g. , model h1 and dp1 ) .    among our 15 realistic dwarf disk galaxies ,",
    "13 models form bars and 9 experience recurrent buckling instabilities .",
    "this suggests that bar regrowth and ensuing recurrent bucklings are quite common , at least for the progenitors of dedis .",
    "the regrowth is not observed in model dm1 with small @xmath41 due to the lack of the angular momentum exchange .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , who showed that the regrowth of a bar is mediated by the resonant interaction between the bar and the surrounding halo .",
    "our numerical results suggest that not only the disk - halo ratio , but also the strength of the first buckling , is essential for the regrowth . between models v1 and v2 , for example , the first buckling instability in model v1 is sufficiently strong to significantly dissolve the bar , leaving only a small number of stars near the resonant bar - end regions for the regrowth .",
    "consequently , regrowth occurs faster in model v2 and the resulting the secondary buckling is stronger than in model v1 .",
