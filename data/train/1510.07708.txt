    "if it is possible to ensure very small beam misalignment then the lowest possible intensity variance , and best possible rabi oscillation fidelity , is obtained for @xmath160 as is shown in table [ tab : variancealignednear6 ] .",
    "variations of @xmath18 by @xmath161 about this value have only a small effect on the intensity variance .",
    "it is apparent from our results that the super gaussian beam has only a minor effect on the amplitude achieved in a @xmath151 or @xmath162 pulse , but has a large influence , by up to a factor of 60 , on the decay time of the rabi oscillations .",
    "very high fidelity gates as needed for scalable quantum computation will likely be based on composite pulse techniques@xcite to minimize sensitivity to imperfect control of the pulse area .",
    "since composite pulses imply larger total pulse areas the increase of the decay time afforded by the super gaussian pulse will be particularly useful in conjunction with composite pulses .",
    "we have studied the super gaussian beam profile because it has a compact analytical form and is readily visualized .",
    "this leaves open the question of what the global optimal beam shape might be .",
    "the choice of an optimal shape will strongly depend on the experimental conditions .",
    "if there is no experimental beam misalignment and the atoms are very cold and well localized then a high order beam profile with excellent uniformity is to be preferred .",
    "allowing for misalignment and atomic motion a lower order profile with smoothly varying intensity gives better performance .",
    "the specific choice can not be predicted in general and will depend on actual parameters .    in order to reap full advantage of using a specific beam profile",
    "it is of course necessary to generate such a profile experimentally .",
    "there are several methods available for beam shaping of top hat , or similar profiles , including aspherical lenses@xcite , diffractive optical elements@xcite , and computer controlled spatial light modulators ( slms)@xcite . although arbitrary beam shapes with desired amplitude and phase profiles can in principle be produced using a slm in holographic mode there remains the experimental challenge of compensating for imperfections due to optical elements and vacuum windows .",
    "a notable advance was reported recently in @xcite where a slm together with a shack - hartmann wave - front sensor was used to correct for imperfections in the optical train and obtain a uniform array of intensity spots with a standard deviation of only 1.4% .",
    "based on these techniques it should be possible to create essentially any desired beam profile with accuracy at the 1% level . such accuracy together with",
    "the weak sensitivity of the atom averaged intensity variance with super gaussian index presented in table [ tab : variancealignednear6 ] , suggests that performance comparable to that calculated here will be possible in real experiments .",
