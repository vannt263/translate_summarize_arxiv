    "the special and general theory of relativity which was developed in the beginning of the twentieth century , especially through einstein s work@xcite , has its roots far back in the past .",
    "but the rotational reference systems utilized in the present researches of physics are all classical@xcite , although there exists the special and general theory of relativity . in the classical rotation ,",
    "the velocity @xmath0 of one point relative to the center of circle is proportional to its distance @xmath1 from the center of circle and its angular frequency @xmath2 .",
    "however , this relationship is not suitable within the special relativistic theory .",
    "the velocity formula of classical rotation is given as @xmath3 .",
    "it could be understood from the following three aspects .",
    "first , the foundation of experiments , i.e. , the experience of daily life .",
    "second , galilean transformations @xcite .",
    "third , the general conclusion derived from the first and the second points . following the inference of galilean transformations , the velocity formula of classical rotation is generally come into existence under any rotational conditions , such as the condition of long - distance and high - velocity .",
    "it means that the formula @xmath3 is self - consistent in classical .",
    "however , the application of galilean transformations in high - velocity condition is proved early to be not reliable@xcite .",
    "it is not correct for the object with high velocity and must be replaced with the principle that could embodies the relativistic properties .",
    "therefore , the extending velocity formula @xmath3 of classical rotation to arbitrary is suspicious , and it is need to reevaluate .",
    "we should start from the special relativistic theory to reconsider the rotation with high velocity .",
    "the proper relativistic metric of rotational reference system should be confirmed .",
    "the four - dimension metric of the uniform rotational system is classical in the general theory of relativity now@xcite .",
    "it means the proper relativistic present of the rotational system could nt be given in the general theory of relativity . and",
    "the uniform rigid rotation is instantaneous and local inertial , so we could research it in the frame of the special theory of relativity .    to perform the relativistic analysis of uniform rotation , the galilean transformations and its deduced conclusion , i.e. , the formula @xmath3 is extended to be correct in infinite distances , should be discarded .",
    "nevertheless , we hold the opinion as usual experience that the classical formula of rotation is applicable within short distances . in every observational point ,",
    "what the observer measures is just the rotational velocities in very close distances , while for the rotational velocities far away from the observers , the calculation using the transformation of velocity @xcite in the special theory of relativity is needed .",
    "we analysis the classical rotation firstly , and point out its non - self - consistent disadvantage .",
    "a rotational formula of angular velocity with relativistic character is obtained , which approach to classical velocity in the limit of non - relativity .",
    "it shows that the classical rotation is only local and slow - velocity approximation of the relativistic one .",
    "in classical rotation the velocity @xmath4 of one point relative to another point is equal to the product of its angular frequency @xmath5 and its distance from center point @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7    we show in fig.[fig1 ] the rotation of a long pole around point @xmath8 with frequency @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the pole is in a part of space so far from all masses that all gravitational effects can be neglected .",
    "the distance of point @xmath9 and @xmath10 from center point @xmath8 is @xmath6 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "their velocities relative to the center point @xmath8 are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , in the classical limit . however",
    ", if one considers the transformation formula of the velocity in the special theory of relativity , the velocity of point @xmath10 over point @xmath8 becomes @xmath14    we can see from formula ( [ eq2 ] ) that the velocity obtained from classical limit can not coincide with the one derived from the relativistic one due to the use of the transformation formula of the velocity in the special theory of relativity .",
    "it implies that the classical rotation is not self - consistent in the framework of the special theory of relativity .",
    "no one will suspect the accuracy of classical rotation formula in daily life .",
    "in fact , the correction term in the denominator of eq.2 is nearly equal to zero under the ordinary condition .",
    "nevertheless , when the classical rotation formula is extended to infinite , i.e. @xmath15 , the galilean transformations is still applied but not the special relativity .",
    "it is shown that this kind of formula can not fulfill the special theory of relativity .",
    "this motivates us to improve the classical rotation .",
    "because the general theory of relativity only gives the principle of equivalence , has nothing to do with the rotational system@xcite , the relativistic rotational system can not be obtained through it .",
    "therefore , we start from the special theory of relativity to study the rotational system , and to derive the kinematical equation of the relevant rotational system . from the kinematical point of view , the investigation of the rotation based on the special theory of relativity is suitable .",
    "we can see from formula ( [ eq2 ] ) that the velocity ( eq.[eq1 ] ) of classical rotation is not correct for the whole description of rotation under the framework of special relativity . in order to obtain the suitable expression of the rotational velocity",
    ", we discard the assumption of formula ( [ eq1 ] ) for the whole - description and only consider it as the local approximation . the formula ( 1 )",
    "is only suitable in the limit of @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we think that there is not intrinsic discrepancy between the inertial and noninertial system if the gravitation is not taken into account , and the instantaneous localization of rotational system is approximately regarded as the inertial one .",
    "moreover , the two adjacent systems of instantaneous localization fulfill the principle of special relativity .",
    "taking point @xmath9 as the reference point , we would determine the velocity of point @xmath10 relative to point @xmath9 in the framework of special relativity using the former conditions .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "the observers at each point would see that the object in very small area rotates uniformly around the point .",
    "assuming that the distance between point @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath6 , we now calculate the velocity of point @xmath10 relative to point @xmath9 at the rotating long - pole .",
    "obviously , we could not measure the velocity at point b directly .",
    "however , it could be measured via the following method : the distance between point @xmath9 and @xmath10 is divided into @xmath17 equal parts , and each point in every equal parts could be considered as one instantaneous inertial reference system .",
    "therefore , the velocity of the point , where the distance from the original point is @xmath18 , could be measured , and the velocity of this point is @xmath19 .",
    "then , we would measure the next @xmath20 position , where the distance from the original point is @xmath21 , and the velocity of position @xmath22 relative to the position @xmath20 is also @xmath23 .",
    "the measurement is continued until reaching the position of @xmath6 , and then , we could calculate the velocity of the last point relative to the beginning point taking advantage of the relativistic velocity transfer formula .",
    "based on the relations of velocity in these instantaneous inertial system , the velocity @xmath24 is the very relativistic velocity @xmath25 when @xmath17 approaches infinite .",
    "the velocity of each point relative to point @xmath9 is @xmath26    the velocity of inertial system @xmath10 relative to the one of @xmath9 is the value of @xmath27 in the limit of @xmath17 approaching infinite .",
    "according to formula ( [ eq3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath28 \\end{array}\\ ] ] defining @xmath29 , @xmath30 we could rewrite formula ( 4 ) as @xmath31    the @xmath32 could be expressed in terms of continued fraction @xmath33    the recursive properties of the continued fraction is as follow@xcite @xmath34 where the series of @xmath35 and @xmath36 could be solved in terms of the characteristic equation of recursive series@xcite    @xmath37    the two solutions of formula ( [ eq8 ] ) are @xmath38 then , the general solutions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath39 it is obtained with the original condition of formula ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "@xmath40 inserting formula ( [ eq11 ] ) into formula ( [ eq10 ] ) and considering the formula ( [ eq7 ] ) , we can get @xmath41    inserting @xmath42 and @xmath18 into the former formula ( [ eq12 ] ) , the relativistic velocity in the limit of @xmath43 is @xmath44 i.e. , @xmath45    which is the expecting formula of relativistic rotation velocity .",
    "we calculate numerically the results of formula ( [ eq3 ] ) , and the consistent results are reached with formula ( [ eq13 ] ) . comparing with the classical rotation formula ( [ eq1 ] )",
    ", we can see that the classical rotation is the approximation of formula ( [ eq13 ] ) in the limit of @xmath46 . for the case",
    "far from classical rotation , an additional correction term @xmath47 is obtained from formula ( 13 ) in comparison with formula ( 1 ) , i.e. , @xmath48    considering the three points ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath49 ) in the same line , we could calculate easily the their velocity using the relativistic transfer formula of velocity and formula ( [ eq13 ] ) @xmath50    these show that the velocity relation in formula ( [ eq13 ] ) is self - consistent in the framework of special relativity , and now the relativistic space - time interval are different with the classical one@xcite .",
    "it could be expressed in cylindrical coordinates @xmath51    it is also observed from the comparison between formula ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) that the angular velocity in the classical rotation is only the value in token of the frequency of relativistic rotation , while not the real angular velocity of relativistic rotation .",
    "the relativistic angular velocity @xmath52 of two points in relativistic rotation is no longer the physical invariable in the classical rotation .",
    "it is with respect to not only the token angular velocity but also the distance of the two points , i.e. , @xmath53    it is obviously @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 , which is different with the classical one . in classical rotation reference systems , what could be observed is only within the range from observation point extending to @xmath58 .",
    "otherwise , with larger distances , the observation velocity will greater than velocity of light that could not be achieved by realistic objects . nevertheless ,",
    "in the relativistic rotation reference systems , the former case could not exist .",
    "it could be found from formula ( [ eq13 ] ) that all the velocity are less than velocity of light @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , the discrepancy of angular velocity with the relativistic uniform rotation are generally not observed in the dailylife due to the condition @xmath60 .",
    "the expression of transverse doppler effect can be obtained from special relativity in classical rotation @xcite .",
    "for instance , there is a light - source with frequency @xmath61 at point b in fig.[fig1 ] . following the doppler formula in special relativity and formula ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "the frequency of the light at point a in classical rotation is given as @xmath62    however , in relativistic rotation , through the doppler formula in special relativity and formula ( [ eq13 ] ) , the observed frequency of the light at point a is as follow @xmath63    for further understanding , we plot in fig.[fig2 ] the transverse doppler shift for classical and relativistic rotations , respectively , for the comparison between formula ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "the product @xmath64 in classical rotation can not greater than velocity of light , otherwise , imaginary number will occur in the frequency .",
    "however , in relativistic rotation , this product may greater than the velocity of light , and the properties of @xmath65 in equation ( [ eq19 ] ) will not be affected .",
    "the difference of these two cases would only exhibit when the value of @xmath64 approaches the velocity of light . expanding the series of formula ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) to their order with @xmath66 , we can get their difference @xmath67 it is obviously showed in formula ( [ eq20 ] ) that the discrepancy is hardly observed in ordinary conditions .",
    "however , we may observe this discrepancy in the large - scale rotations such as the rotation of galaxy .",
    "the classical rotation which considers the rotation formula ( [ eq1 ] ) as the whole - conditions is not self - consistent in the special relativistic description .",
    "we propose the velocity expression ( [ eq13 ] ) of relativistic rotation taking advantage of formula ( [ eq1 ] ) only as the local condition .",
    "this velocity is self - consistent for the whole description of rotation .",
    "the relativistic rotation can reduce to the classical one in the classical conditions , while greatly different properties are exhibited in comparison with the classical rotation in the relativistic condition , i.e. @xmath68 . with the flourish development of astrophysics ,",
    "the self - consistent relativistic rotation would make one understand the phenomena of celestial rotations more suitably than the classical one .",
    "moreover , the relativistic rotation may provide a feasible way for the basic and theoretical description of rotation .",
