    ", detections of agns were limited to a handful of sources with poor photon statistics , preventing a detailed analysis of their x - ray spectral properties ( kaspi , brandt , & schneider 2000 ) ; this was also , in part , a consequence of the relatively small number ( @xmath4100 ) of such sources discovered by the year 2000 .",

    ". however , many of the observations are shallow , aimed at just detecting the agn , and do not allow useful measurements of the spectral properties in individual sources ( e.g. , brandt et al .  2002 ; vignali et al .  2003a , 2005 ) .",
