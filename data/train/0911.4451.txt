    "tev - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most compelling theories of physics beyond the standard model for several reasons : it facilitates unification of the gauge couplings , as expected in grand unified theories ( guts ) ; it stabilizes the higgs vacuum expectation value , offering a solution to the related heirarchy and naturalness problems of the standard model ; and it predicts a light higgs boson , as expected from electroweak precision measurements . in addition , if r - parity is conserved , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable , and , if uncharged , is therefore a natural particle candidate for astrophysical cold dark matter .",
    "phenomenologically , one of the most - studied versions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , in which the soft supersymmetry - breaking contributions to the masses of the susy partners of the quarks and leptons and the higgs scalars are universal at some gut input scale , as motivated by minimal supergravity . however , while the cmssm may be the simplest scenario , it is by no means the most plausible version of the mssm . here , we present the results of recent studies of models with non - universal supersymmetry - breaking contributions to the higgs masses  @xcite .",
    "the cmssm is parametrized by four continuous parameters specified at the susy gut scale and a sign choice : the universal gaugino mass , @xmath0 , the universal scalar mass , @xmath1 , the universal value for the trilinear couplings , @xmath2 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath3 , and the sign of the higgs mixing parameter , @xmath4 . in this scenario ,",
    "the gut - scale values of the effective higgs masses are @xmath5 , and the electroweak vacuum conditions fix @xmath6 and the pseudoscalar higgs mass , @xmath7 . in the nuhm1 ,",
    "the effective higgs masses are assumed to be universal at the gut scale , though the universality with @xmath1 is relaxed .",
    "one more input parameter , in addition to those of the cmssm , is required , and may be taken as @xmath4 , @xmath7 , or the gut - scale value of the higgs masses @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , in nuhm2 models , no relation between @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath1 is assumed .",
    "this scenario may be parametrized by additional inputs @xmath4 and @xmath7 , or by both gut - scale effective higgs masses .    in each scenario ,",
    "the renormalization group equations of the mssm are used to determine the low - scale observables , and constraints from colliders and cosmology are applied .",
    "we assume that the lightest neutralino is the dark matter candidate , calculate its abundance , and determine the prospects for direct detection for models which are phenomenologically and cosmologically viable , i.e. models not excluded by constraints from colliders , and where the upper limit on the relic density of neutralinos is respected .",
    "direct detection experiments derive limits on the dark matter - nucleon scattering cross section under the assumption that the local density of cold dark matter comes from a single source , that is , one particle species is responsible for the entire dark matter abundance , @xmath11 .",
    "however , this may not be the case .",
    "if the calculated neutralino abundance is less than the wmap central value  @xcite , @xmath11 , we assume a secondary source of cold dark matter , and rescale the neutralino - nucleon cross sections by a factor @xmath12 in order to compare our calculated elastic scattering cross sections with limits from direct searches .",

    "the limit on the branching ratio of @xmath20 is important at very low @xmath7 and @xmath1 , but it is the constraint on the higgs mass ( red dot - dashed curve , roughly horizontal at @xmath66 gev ) that places a lower limit on the expected lsp mass for the funnel region of @xmath67 gev .",

    "is reflected in the lower cutoff on the lsp mass , @xmath63 gev , seen in the right panel for the points with @xmath68 few @xmath69 pb . in the focus - point region , the lsp is in a mixed state with @xmath65 gev , and the cross section may be much larger : by two orders of magnitude for the si cross section , and four orders of magnitude for the sd cross section .",
    "these large cross sections at large @xmath25 have no counterparts in the cmssm , where mixed states in the focus - point region are much lighter .",
    "furthermore , in the cmssm , the focus point is reached only at large @xmath1 , whereas here it appears even at fixed @xmath70 gev .",
    "cdms  ii and xenon10 are already beginning to probe he large scalar cross sections in the focus - point region , with a few points at very low @xmath0 already being excluded , as one can see directly in the right panel  gev and are within the solid green contour in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nuhm1mavm ] at very low values of @xmath0 and @xmath7 . ] .",
    "we also note that there are points in the right panel with very low cross sections even though they have @xmath71  gev , which also have no counterparts in the cmssm .",
    "these points are associated with the funnel and their cross sections are scaled down due to the low relic density in that region .",
    "a new feature seen in this plot is the near - vanishing of the spin - dependent cross section when @xmath72 gev .",
    "this feature is associated with the funnel region where elastic scattering cross sections are substantially lower than those of the focus - point region .",
    "however , near @xmath72 gev there is the possibility for a complete cancellation in the sd neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering matrix elements when the spin contribution from up quarks cancels that due to down and strange quarks .",
    "the exact position of the cancellation is sensitive to the values of the spin matrix elements adopted , but the existence of the cancellation is robust . of course",
    ", as we present here the cross sections for scattering on protons , the cross sections for scattering on neutrons will not exhibit a cancellation in the same place .",
    "as already discussed , the nuhm2 has two parameters in addition to those already present in the cmssm , which may be taken as free choices of both the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath4 . as the number of parameters is relatively large , a systematic survey of the nuhm2 parameter space is quite complex . here",
    "we exhibit one plane of parameter space whose features we compare with the cmssm and nuhm1 .",
    "for further discussions of direct detection cross sections in the nuhm2 , see @xcite .",
    "we display in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nuhm2 ] a sample nuhm2 @xmath73 plane with @xmath22 and fixed @xmath74  gev and @xmath75  gev , which reveals a few interesting new features . as in the cmssm , there is a region in the plane at large @xmath0 and small @xmath1 which is forbidden because the lighter stau is the lsp . just above this forbidden region , as in the cmssm , there is a stau - coannihilation strip .",
    "however , jutting up from this strip at @xmath76  gev and @xmath77  gev , there are vertical strips where the relic density of neutralinos falls within the wmap range .",
    "the double strips at @xmath76  gev form a rapid - annihilation funnel on either side of the ( solid blue ) contour where @xmath78 .",
    "again , such funnels appear only at large @xmath79 in the cmssm , but the freedom to choose different values of @xmath7 in the nuhm2 permits the appearance of a rapid - annihilation funnel also at the low value @xmath22 shown here .",
    "the other vertical wmap strip appears because , as @xmath0 increases relative to @xmath4 ( which is fixed here ) , the higgsino fraction of the lightest neutralino increases , which in turn increases the annihilation rate , decreasing the relic density . in this case , this results in a crossover region when @xmath80  gev . at slightly larger @xmath81 gev ,",
    "the lightest and next - to - lightest neutralinos are nearly degenerate in mass , and rapid coannihilations ( through @xmath82-exchange ) result in a narrow region with suppressed relic density , and therefore a suppressed scalar cross section .",

    "the right panel shows the corresponding neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering cross sections for phenomenologically - viable models .",
    "[ fig : nuhm2],title=\"fig : \" ]   plane for @xmath83 gev , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the right panel shows the corresponding neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering cross sections for phenomenologically - viable models .",
    "[ fig : nuhm2],title=\"fig : \" ]    these novel regions are clearly visible in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nuhm2 ] . the elastic scattering cross sections do not vary rapidly as @xmath25 increases , until the funnel region at @xmath84  gev is reached .",
    "the `` v''-shaped suppression in the cross section arises from the increasing value of @xmath1 as one rises up the funnel .",
    "the two sides of the funnel approach each other as @xmath1 increases , eventually joining together and resulting in a minimum value where the two sides of the funnel meet ( at a value of @xmath85  gev ) . after this excitement ,",
    "the cross section continues to rise gradually as one follows the coannihilation strip , until the crossover strip is reached at @xmath86  gev .",
    "here the cross section decreases again as @xmath1 increases , to values even smaller than in the rapid - annihilation funnel , before rising again and finally declining towards the end of the coannihilation strip .",
    "note that the entire region to the right of the transition strip is viable , albeit with a relic density below the wmap range .",
    "the cross section is therefore reduced due to scaling .",
    "because the neutralino is predominantly higgsino - like here , its mass is given by @xmath4 rather than @xmath0 , and so we see in the right panel that the largest values of @xmath25 correspond to our choice of fixed @xmath4 .",
    "finally , in fig .  [ nuhmrand ] we show the entire potential ranges for the si neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering cross section as a function of neutralino mass in the nuhm1 ( left ) and nuhm2 ( right ) . because of the additional freedom in the higgs sector , and since the si elastic scattering cross sections receive important contributions from higgs exchange , there is more variability in the cross sections in the nuhm1 and nuhm2 than in the cmssm .",
    "this is clear from comparison with the corresponding cmssm panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmssmrand ] . differences are due primarily to the appearance of additional regions of parameter space in nuhm models where the lightest neutralino is in a mixed bino - higgsino state , such as the crossover region .    , 100 gev @xmath87 gev , 0 @xmath42 gev , and @xmath43 .",

    "[ nuhmrand],title=\"fig : \" ]    in both the nuhm1 and nuhm2 , we find significantly larger cross sections at larger @xmath25 than would be expected in the cmssm .",
    "these cross sections may be probed by the next generation of direct detection experiments for @xmath25 as large as @xmath89 gev , while in the cmssm there is no hope for detection with these instruments for @xmath90 gev .",
    "in addition , we find viable points at very low @xmath25 with rather low cross sections . if nature has given us a neutralino of this character , then we may not directly detect dark matter for some time , but the lhc may find supersymmetric particles fairly quickly . in either scenario , we will know that the cmssm is not an adequate description of nature .",
    "we look forward to results from both collider experiments and the next generation of dark matter direct detection experiments , which may give us some interesting hints about the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
