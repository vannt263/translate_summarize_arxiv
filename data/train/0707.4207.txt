    "the main focus of this work is a stochastic growth model in @xmath1 dimensions , called the polynuclear growth ( png ) model .",
    "it belongs to the kpz ( kardar - parisi - zhang  @xcite ) universality class and it can be described as follows ( see figure  [ figpng ] ) . at time @xmath2 , the surface is described by an integer - valued height function @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "it thus consists of up - steps ( @xmath5 ) and down - steps ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the dynamics has a deterministic and a stochastic part : + ( a ) up- ( down- ) steps move to the left ( right ) with unit speed and disappear upon colliding , + ( b ) pairs of up- and down- steps ( nucleations ) are randomly added on the surface with some given intensity .",
    "+ the up- and down - steps of the nucleations then spread out with unit speed according to ( a ) .",
    "the png model can be interpreted in several different ways , see  @xcite for a review .        on a macroscopic scale",
    "the surface of the png model grows deterministically , i.e. , @xmath7 is a non - random function . however , on a mesoscopic scale fluctuations grow in time .",
    "this is called roughening in statistical physics and extensive numerical studies have been made  @xcite .",
    "since the png model is in the kpz universality class , the fluctuation of the surface height is expected to live on a @xmath8 scale and non - trivial correlations are to be seen on a @xmath9 scale .",
    "therefore , to have an interesting large time limit , we have to rescale the surface height as @xmath10    one of the most natural initial conditions for png is the flat initial condition , i.e. , @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "we consider nucleations occurring with translation - invariant intensity .",
    "we refer to the png model with such initial condition as _",
    "flat png_. in this case , by mapping the flat png to a point - to - line directed percolation model it was proven  @xcite that the one - point distribution is , in the @xmath13 limit , the goe tracy - widom distribution @xmath14 , first discovered in random matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "however , no information on joint height distributions at more than one point has been previously known .",
    "_ new results .",
    "_ the main results of this paper are precisely the computation and asymptotic analysis of these joint distributions . in particular , we prove the convergence of the height rescaled as in ( [ eqfirst ] ) to the airy@xmath0 process in the @xmath13 limit ( see section  [ subsectscalinglimit ] for a definition of the process ) .",
    "the airy@xmath0 process has been discovered in the context of the asymmetric exclusion process  @xcite .",
    "our result , stated in theorem  [ thmxitai ] , is obtained by first determining an expression for the joint distributions for finite time @xmath2 ( proposition  [ proppng ] ) and then taking the appropriate scaling limit .",
    "proposition  [ proppng ] is actually just a particular case of theorem  [ thmcpng ] , where we determine joint distributions along any space - like paths ( as in minkowski diagram ) , for which fixed time is a special case .",
    "the scaling limit is analyzed at this level of generality , thus theorem  [ thmxitai ] holds for any space - like paths .",
    "in contrast to previous works on the subject , our approach does not rely on the so - called rsk correspondence ( rsk for robinson - schensted - knuth ) , which was successfully applied for corner growth models , but does not seem to be well suited for the flat growth .    on the way of getting the results for the flat png , we consider a discrete time version of it , the gates - westcott dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this model is closely related to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) in discrete time with parallel update and alternating initial conditions .",
    "the corresponding results for this model are theorem  [ thmkalt ] for the joint distributions along space - like paths , and theorem  [ thmxitoai ] for the convergence to the airy@xmath0 process in the scaling limit . for the tasep ,",
    "the extreme situations of space - like paths are positions of different particles at a fixed time and positions of a fixed particle at different time moments ( tagged particle ) . the space - like extension for tasep",
    "is based on the previous paper  @xcite .",
    "_ previous works on png .",
    "_ another type of initial conditions for the png model has been analyzed before .",
    "it is the corner growth geometry , where nucleations occur only inside the cone @xmath15 .",
    "the limit shape @xmath16 is a semi - circle , and the model is called _ png droplet_. in this geometry , the limit process has been obtained in  @xcite ; it is known as airy@xmath17 process ( previously called simply airy process ) .",
    "the approach uses an extension to a multilayer model ( inherited from the rsk construction ) , see  @xcite .",
    "the multilayer method was also used in other related models  @xcite . also , for the flat png it was used to connect the associated point process at a single position and the point process of goe eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "results on the behavior for the png droplet along space - like paths can be found in @xcite . for a very brief description of the previously known results on tasep fluctuations",
    "see the introductions of @xcite .      in section [ sectmodel ]",
    ", we introduce our models and state the results . in section [ sectjointdistr ] , we give an expression of the transition probability of the discrete tasep as a marginal of a determinantal signed point process . in section [ sectjointspacelike ] the fredholm determinant expression for the joint distributions is obtained .",

    "so , we can choose a @xmath39 independent of @xmath564 for some @xmath565 .",
