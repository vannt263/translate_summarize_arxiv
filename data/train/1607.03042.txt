    "fluorescence images ( exposure time 50  ms ) of the atoms are acquired by a sensitive ccd camera ( we actually use an emccd camera [ andor ixon ultra ] but electron - multiplication is not enabled ) . from these images , a python program locates the initially filled traps , and , using the algorithm described in the main text , generates a list of moves ( i.e. of the pairs of initial and final traps ) needed to sort the array . for our largest arrays this algorithm takes less than 1 ms on a standard computer ( intel(r ) core(tm ) i5 3470 3.2 ghz , 8 gb ram ; the algorithm is implemented in python 3.4 ) .",
    "the program then transfers this list via the serial port to two microcontrollers ( arduino due , at91sam3x8e arm cortex - m3 board ) which convert this list into three waveforms ( using 12-bit dac outputs ) that are used to control the intensity and positions along x and y of the moving optical tweezers . using home - built rf drivers that feed a two - dimensional aod ( aa - optoelectonic dtsxy-400 - 850 ) .",
    "the moving tweezers covers a range of @xmath38 in the plane where the atoms are trapped and can be deflected at speeds higher than 1 @xmath39 , much faster than required for adiabatic atom transport .",
    "an accurate calibration of the voltage / position conversion is obtained by imaging the plane of the atomic array on a diagnostic ccd camera and measuring the position of the moving tweezers with respect to the fixed traps when the x- and y- voltages are varied ; this ensures that all atom extractions and releases are made at optimal positions .     for a transfer between two traps separated by @xmath40 . * ( a ) * : as a function of the depth @xmath41 of the moving tweezers ; * ( b ) * : as a function of the take / release time @xmath13 ; * ( c ) * : as a function of the transfer velocity @xmath14 .",

    "( e ) * : otherwise the atoms are moved along the lattice links ( `` type 2 '' moves).,width=321 ]",
    "we have investigated how the transfer efficiency between two adjacent traps depends on the moving tweezers depth @xmath41 , on the take / release time @xmath13 , and on the transfer velocity @xmath14 [ fig .",
    "s.2 a , b , c ] .",
    "the points are the average of the success probability over different paths in a square lattice of 9 traps ( the shaded area shows the full extent of the distribution over the array ) . for @xmath44 , a moving tweezers depth of around @xmath45  mk , and a transfer speed of @xmath46 , we measure , in 2000 repetitions of the experiment , a success rate of @xmath47 . with these parameters",
    "we do not observe appreciable heating during transport ( the measured temperatures before and after a move are @xmath48 ) .",
    "we use transfer times considerably longer than required for adiabatic motion , but still short enough to allow us to complete a full set of operations to assemble arrays containing tens of atoms .",
    "further optimization could ultimately push time constants down to the limit given by the oscillation frequencies of the trapping potential ( using an arbitrary waveform generator to directly drive the aods with optimized sweeps , we have measured similar transport fidelities for transfer times ten times as short ; however , no attempt was made to incorporate these optimized sweeps into our protocol ) .",

    "( b ) * : for a compact square lattice , the assembly time scales approximately as @xmath49 ( dashed line ) .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively as follows : in such a compact configuration , a significant fraction @xmath50 of the atoms needs to be moved several times ( about @xmath51 times , i.e. the linear dimension of the array ) between its initial and final position , as other atoms in the way impede a direct transfer .",

    "an array of @xmath53 traps requires about @xmath54 milliwatts of laser power , meaning that arrays of several hundreds of atoms should be achievable with commercially available lasers delivering a few watts . * with our current aspheric lens , coma ( and other aberrations ) degrade the quality of the tweezers that are more than @xmath55 m off - axis , limiting the number of traps to about 200 .",
    "this could be extended significantly , e.g. by using a microscope objective instead of a single aspheric lens .",
    "* another limit is imposed by collisions with the background gas .",
    "a defect - free configuration of @xmath17 atoms has a lifetime @xmath26 , where @xmath56 is vacuum - limited lifetime of a trapped atom ( @xmath25  s in our setup ) .",
    "the time needed to assemble the arrays needs to be shorter than this lifetime .",

    "the intersection of the two curves gives a rough estimate of the array sizes that can be reached without being limited by background - gas collisions , i.e. about @xmath57 for our parameters .",
    "this can be increased ( i ) by improving the vacuum ( a factor of ten increase in @xmath56 is realistic with standard techniques ) ; ( ii ) by optimizing the duration of each move and minimizing the number of moves required for sorting .",

    "<S> this bottom - up approach offers faster preparation and a higher degree of tunability of the underlying geometry . </S>",
    "<S> however , achieving unit filling of the arrays is hampered by the stochastic nature of the loading and has remained so far elusive . </S>",

    "<S> despite those efforts , loading efficiencies of around 90% at best for a single atom in a single tweezers could be achieved @xcite , making the probabilities to fully load large arrays still exponentially small .    a different approach towards this goal , pioneered in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> this is accomplished through the sequential assembly of the atoms in the arrays using a fast programmable control system . </S>",
    "<S> starting from stochastically loaded half - filled arrays with @xmath3 traps , we analyze in real - time the initial atom distribution , and use a fast , moving optical tweezer to rearrange the atoms into a user - defined target spatial configuration , thus implementing a modern variant of maxwell s demon  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that it could be scaled up to a few hundreds of atoms , still maintaining filling fractions close to unity , as the size of the arrays we can prepare is at present mostly limited by the available laser power . </S>",

    "<S> `` type 1 '' moves transfer an atom by moving it in between other traps , which allows us to have on the order of @xmath23 atom moves only . </S>",
    "<S> however , type 1 moves were found to lead to atom loss in the traps close to the moving tweezers trajectory when @xmath24 , and thus , for such arrays , we used `` type 2 '' moves where atoms are moved along the links of the arrays .    choosing </S>",
    "<S> the best algorithm to calculate the atom moves would ideally require finding the optimal list that minimizes the number of moves and total distance ( thus minimizing the time it takes to reorder the array ) : in our arrays trapped atoms have a vacuum - limited lifetime @xmath25  </S>",
    "<S> s , and thus , the estimated lifetime of a configuration with @xmath17 atoms is @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the total sequence should remain shorter than this to achieve high fidelities . </S>",
    "<S> however , finding the optimum set of paths is a hard computational task , reminiscent of the notoriously difficult traveling salesman problem . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a heuristic path - finding algorithm which first computes a list of all possibles moves , and orders it according to their length ; we then select moves from source to target traps , starting by the shortest ones , until all target traps are filled . </S>",
    "<S> this results in @xmath27 moves ( however , this does not necessarily minimize the total travel distance ) . </S>",
    "<S> we finally get rid of the unused extra atoms ( if any ) by moving them to positions far away from any trap . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , for `` type 2 '' moves , we have to avoid moving the tweezers over filled traps ( to prevent the tweezers from dragging along other atoms during its motion ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we enforce this constraint in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> if the source atom @xmath28 needs to be moved to the target trap @xmath29 ( we denote this move by @xmath30 ) and that an `` obstacle '' @xmath31 is on the way , we replace the move @xmath30 by the two moves @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this increases slightly the number of needed moves , as sometimes some filled traps are `` in the way '' , but the overhead is moderate  @xcite .    for our largest arrays , the total arrangement process is typically performed within less than 50 ms after the initial image is acquired , a timescale still shorter than the lifetime of the initial configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we want to emphasize that despite being quite simple and non - optimal , our algorithm is efficient and versatile . </S>",

    "<S> , type-1 moves were used , while in ( b ) , type-2 moves were used . for each array , we show on the top panel a fluorescence image of single atoms obtained with the ccd camera at the beginning of the sequence . since the probability for each trap to be filled is @xmath35 , </S>",
    "<S> the arrays are initially half - filled . in the accompanying bottom image </S>",
    "<S> we show the final fluorescence image after the sorting is completed . analyzing 100 repetitions of the experiment for a @xmath36 square target array [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](a ) ] , we achieve a filling fraction @xmath37% , which gives rise to a probability of getting a defect - free array of about 40% . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](b ) , the filling fraction decreases only marginally when the number of atoms increases , showing the scalability of our approach . in order to achieve even higher filling fractions </S>",
    "<S> , one could envision to iterate the procedure presented here , i.e. skip the disposal of unused atoms , analyze the `` final '' image and fill in defects ( if any ) with remaining atoms .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the implementation of a robust procedure based on site - selective atom manipulation , that allows for the rapid preparation of defect - free arrays of single neutral atoms . analyzing the technical limitations of the current implementation </S>",
    "<S> suggests that preparing hundreds of individual atoms in arrays of arbitrary geometries very close to unit filling is realistic with state - of - the - art technology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results , possibly combined with raman sideband cooling of atoms in optical microtraps @xcite , open promising paths to study many - body physics and constitute an important resource for quantum information processing with cold neutral atoms . in the future , using the same technique , it should be possible to insert atoms one at a time into a microtrap  @xcite , thus preparing small samples with an exact atom number , e.g. for applications in cold chemistry .    30    s. haroche , nobel lecture : controlling photons in a box and exploring the quantum to classical boundary , http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.85.1083[_rev . </S>",
