    "recently , extremely high superconducting upper - critical fields were observed in ultra thin single - crystals of transition - metal dichalcogenides for magnetic fields applied along a planar direction @xcite . in effect , in single - layered nbse@xmath12 and in electric field - induced superconducting mos@xmath12 , upper critical fields exceeding the weak coupling pauli limiting field , respectively by factors of 6 and 4 , were reported @xcite .",
    "single atomic layers of both compounds are characterized by lack of inversion symmetry and a strong spin orbit coupling , which couples ( or locks ) the spins of the carriers along the orbital moments pointing perpendicularly to the conducting planes .",
    "valley degeneracy and time reversal symmetry imply that the orbital moments and coupled spins , must have opposite polarization between the valleys at the _ k _ and the _ -k _ points .",
    "while multi - layers are spin degenerate , in single atomic layers the aforementioned coupling induces a zeeman - like spin - splitting of the valence and conduction bands as observed at the _ k_-point of their hexagonal brillouin zone @xcite . ising - like superconducting pairing",
    "is proposed to occur between carriers ( of opposite spin- and valley - polarization ) at the _ k _ and _ -k _ valleys .",
    "this state would be particularly robust against an external in - plane magnetic field due to the spin - valley locking leading to the extremely large values of @xmath7 seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "extremely high upper critical fields were also recently reported for a new family of pd based quasi - one - dimensional transition - metal chalcogenides containing nb and ta @xcite .",
    "although these compounds display relatively low @xmath9s , i.e. ranging from @xmath13 k to @xmath14 k for nb@xmath12pd@xmath15s@xmath16 @xcite and ta@xmath0pd@xmath0te@xmath17 @xcite respectively , they tend to display upper critical fields that greatly exceed the weakly coupling pauli limiting field value @xmath18 .",
    "for example , for nb@xmath12pd@xmath15s@xmath16 one obtains @xmath19 37 t for fields along its @xmath20axis @xcite .",
    "these compounds are characterized by structural disorder due , for instance , to the off stoichiometry of the pd atoms .",
    "disorder was proposed to suppress the paramagnetic pair - breaking effect due to strong spin - orbit scattering thus producing their very high @xmath7s @xcite .",
    "a very large spin - orbit coupling parameter was extracted from a fit to the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg formalism of the superconducting to metallic phase - boundary of nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 @xcite . in nb@xmath12pd@xmath1s@xmath16 the isovalent substitution of pd for the heavier element pt",
    "was found to enhance the ratio of @xmath7 to @xmath9 , while this ratio is slightly suppressed for ni doping @xcite .",
    "this represents additional evidence indicating that spin - orbit coupling on the pd sites plays a relevant role for its superconducting properties contributing to its large upper critical fields .    according to density functional theory calculations",
    "@xcite the fermi surface of these compounds tend to be complex being composed of corrugated quasi - one - dimensional sheets and quasi - two - dimensional surfaces as in nb@xmath12pd@xmath21s@xmath16 @xcite , in addition to a complex three dimensional network as in nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 @xcite . in both compounds",
    "the superconducting anisotropy @xmath22 , defined as the ratio of @xmath23s for fields along the needle or the _",
    "b_-axis with respect to @xmath7s for fields applied along the other crystallographic orientations , is temperature dependent as seen in the fe pnictide superconductors and is interpreted as evidence for multi - band superconductivity .",
    "this conclusion is supported by ref . , which claims that ta@xmath12pds@xmath16 should be considered as a two - band strong - coupled superconductor in the dirty limit",
    "argues that the nearly linear dependence of @xmath7 on temperature @xmath8 displayed by most of these pd based compounds would correspond to experimental evidence for such scenario . based on the previous paragraphs",
    "one would conclude that disorder , multi - band superconductivity and spin - orbit coupling are the basic ingredients leading to the very large @xmath7s observed in the pd based ta and nb chalcogenides .",
    "however , scanning tunnelling spectroscopy measurements on ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 , with a middle point transition at @xmath24 k @xcite , reveals evidence for either an anisotropic superconducting @xmath25wave gap , i.e. having gap minima , or the possibility of gap nodes ( a @xmath26wave component ) in a multi - band system @xcite .",
    "in addition , its extreme anisotropy leads to elongated vortices with a core anisotropy of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , low - temperature thermal conductivity measurements in this compound reveal a significant residual electronic term at zero magnetic field which , similarly to the cuprates , increases rapidly as the field increases hence corresponding to evidence for nodes in its gap function @xcite .",
    "this , coupled to the existence of a superconducting dome in its temperature as a function of pressure phase - diagram would , according to ref . , correspond to evidence for an unconventional superconducting state in ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 .    here , we report the phase diagram of nb@xmath0pd@xmath28se@xmath29 single - crystals displaying a middle point superconducting transition at @xmath30 k which is nearly a factor two higher than the previously reported value .",
    "this suggests that this series also displays a superconducting dome as a function of the pd content .",
    "more importantly , for fields along their needle axis these crystals display an anomalous superconducting to metallic phase - boundary with @xmath23 displaying a @xmath31 dependence on temperature over the entire @xmath8 range .",
    "this is the functional dependence observed in single - crystals composed of single- or few atomic - layers of transition - metal dichalcogenides for fields applied along a planar direction @xcite .",
    "such a dependence leads to a nearly divergent superconducting anisotropy @xmath22 upon approaching @xmath9 which is consistent with two - dimensional superconductivity .",
    "this contrasts with the more conventional phase - diagram extracted from samples displaying lower @xmath9s , indicating a remarkable increase in electronic and hence in superconducting anisotropy and possibly a dependence of the superconducting gap symmetry on pd stoichiometry .",
    "this anomalous @xmath32dependence might be attributable to the locking of the spins along a direction perpendicular to the needle axis due to strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , although our band - structure calculations indicate that so - coupling is relatively weak for this compound .",
    "furthermore , we observe considerably smaller values of @xmath7 for ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 , which is also monoclinic and composed of considerably heavier elements , albeit with its @xmath7s displaying an anomalous linear dependence on temperature over the entire @xmath8 range . for both compounds",
    "the absence of saturation in the low temperature values of @xmath7 , particularly when the magnetic field exceeds the pauli limiting value , is at odds with conventional singlet superconductivity .",
    "our observations suggest that ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 probably is an orbital limited superconductor over the entire @xmath8 range . as for nb@xmath0pd@xmath21se@xmath2 ,",
    "we argue , based on band structure calculations , that ising pairing scenario is unlikely to explain our observations .",
    "instead , its non - stoichiometric composition is likely to induce a very weak coupling between superconducting planes leading to rather small superconducting coherence lengths and possibly to the concomitantly high upper critical fields observed by us .",
    "as of temperature for several randomly oriented ta@xmath33pd@xmath34te@xmath4 single crystals . @xmath35 measured under zero - field cooled conditions is depicted by blue makers , while @xmath35 measured under field - cooled conditions is indicated by red markers . the pronounced deviation among both curves observed below @xmath36 k indicates a bulk superconducting transition .",

    "a pronounced anomaly is observed at @xmath9.,width=7 ]            ta@xmath0pd@xmath0te@xmath39 single - crystals were grown _ via _ a self - flux method where high purity ( @xmath40 % ) elements were mixed in the ratio ta : pd : te of 2:3:15 and then sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule .",
    "the ampoule was heated up to @xmath41 c at a rate of @xmath42 c / h and held at this temperature for 24 h. the ampoule was subsequently cooled to @xmath43 c at a rate of @xmath44 c / h from which temperature it was finally cooled down to room temperature @xcite .",
    "this procedure produces brittle single - crystals with typical dimensions of @xmath45 @xmath46m@xmath47 .",
    "single - crystals produced by this procedure displayed a middle - point superconducting transition @xmath48 k. we also followed the original synthesis method of ref . with a starting mixture of elements in the ratio ta : pd : te of 2:1:11 which was heated up to @xmath49 c and held at this temperature for 12 days .",
    "this procedure yielded single - crystals showing a range of @xmath9s , i.e. from 3.9 k to 4.7 k. nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 single - crystals were grown using the previously reported method @xcite showing a distribution of @xmath9s ranging from @xmath50 k which depends on the pd content @xcite .",
    "the stoichiometric composition was determined by energy dispersive @xmath51-ray spectroscopy ( eds ) . for the nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 single - crystals displaying a higher @xmath9 of @xmath52 k",
    ", eds indicates that the pd content is closer to the stoichiometric value of 1 , or @xmath53 , although it also reveals a considerable excess of se , i.e. nearly 20% in some of the crystals . as for ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4",
    "eds reveals samples with compositions very close to the stoichiometric values , but also samples with a pd deficiency of @xmath54 % in addition to samples apparently belonging to the ta@xmath0pd@xmath0te@xmath17 phase @xcite .",
    "electrical transport measurements were performed by using a combination of superconducting and resistive magnets , coupled to @xmath55he and dilution refrigerators .",

    "both curves were acquired under a field @xmath58 oe .",
    "notice the pronounced diamagnetic signal observed below @xmath59 k indicating bulk superconductivity @xcite .",
    "bulk superconductivity is further supported by the size of the anomaly seen in the electronic contribution to the heat capacity @xmath60 at the superconducting transition , which is shown in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "this curve was collected from several crystals .",
    "@xmath60 was obtained after subtracting a @xmath38 phonon contribution term .",
    "nevertheless , the size of the anomaly @xmath61 mj / molk@xmath62 relative to the electronic contribution to the heat capacity in the metallic state , i.e. @xmath63 mj / molk@xmath62 , is considerably smaller than the bcs value @xmath64 .",
    "this indicates that the superconducting volume fraction is @xmath65 while also reflecting the distribution in @xmath9s among the different crystals .",
    "figure 2 ( a ) shows the resistivity @xmath66 of a ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 single - crystal for currents flowing along the @xmath20axis .",
    "in contrast to both nb@xmath12pd@xmath1s@xmath16 and nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 , see refs . , this compound displays i ) rather small residual resistivities , in the order of just a few @xmath67 cm , and ii ) fermi liquid like behavior as indicated by the red line which corresponds to a fit to @xmath68 .",
    "notice also that the onset of the resistive transition , i.e. the temperature where the resistivity reaches 90 % of its value in the metallic state just above the transition , is @xmath69 k which is slightly higher than the value previously reported @xcite .",
    "figure 2(b ) displays @xmath66 as a function of the applied field @xmath70 applied along the @xmath71-axis for several temperatures . here , we follow the nomenclature used by ref . to identify the crystallographic axes of the single - crystal(s ) , with the @xmath72 and the @xmath71 axes being perpendicular to the @xmath20axis ( and to each other ) but not aligned along the crystallographic @xmath73 and @xmath74 axes .",

    "colored lines depict data collected from a second single - crystal having a similar @xmath9 but measured at temperatures well below 1 k. data from both samples collected over an extended range in temperatures are included in the phase - diagram shown below . by comparing all three panels",
    ", one can see that i ) this compound is mildly anisotropic , ii ) that its superconducting transition does not broaden considerably under field and iii ) that the transition field does not saturate at a given value as @xmath8 is lowered , as one would expect for a conventional superconductor .",
    "subsequently , we compare the upper critical fields observed in ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 with those of nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath75 , since both compounds belong to the same monoclinic @xmath76 space group and display comparatively similar @xmath9s .",
    "the former compound contains heavier elements , therefore one would expect a greater influence of the spin - orbit coupling on its superconducting phase diagram . in reality ,",
    "nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath75 single - crystals with @xmath77 and @xmath9s approaching 2 k , already display considerably higher @xmath7s than those of ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 crystals with @xmath78 k. figure 3 ( a ) displays the resistivity @xmath66 , for electrical currents along the _",

    "similarly to our previous report this sample also displays an anomaly in the resistivity centered around 100 k of unknown origin , but the onset of its superconducting transition starts at a considerably higher temperature , i.e. @xmath79 k. figures 3 ( a ) and ( b ) depict @xmath66 as a function of the magnetic field applied along the @xmath80 and the @xmath81axis respectively , and for several temperatures . notice",
    "that in contrast to ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 the values of its upper critical fields tend to saturate as @xmath8 is lowered , as expected for a singlet - paired superconductor .",
    "figure 3 ( c ) displays @xmath66 as a function of @xmath70 applied along its needle or @xmath20axis . in this panel",
    "we have included data from two samples , one measured under @xmath82 k ( solid lines ) which displays a sharper transition , and a second one characterized by a broader transition under @xmath83 k ( solid markers ) .",
    "both samples display similar @xmath9s and hence similar values of @xmath7 at intermediary temperatures , e.g. at 0.65 k. the residual resistivities were similar for both crystals hence to allow a comparison between both samples we renormalized the resistivity of one of the samples . by comparing all three panels",
    "one concludes i ) that the @xmath7s are anisotropic , increasing considerably for fields along the @xmath84-axis and ii ) that the transition also broadens considerably when tilting the field from the @xmath73 to the @xmath20 axis suggesting a prominent role for superconducting fluctuations .",
    "broader transitions , which are common to the two - dimensional high @xmath9 cuprates @xcite , suggest that the effective electronic dimensionality is reduced by the application of fields along the @xmath81 and more particularly along the @xmath20axis as if the field renormalized the transfer integrals along crystallographic directions perpendicular to these axes .        in figure 4",
    "we plot the superconducting phase diagrams and concomitant superconducting anisotropies for both compounds .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) , the upper critical fields for ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 follow a simple linear dependence on temperature over the _ entire _",
    "@xmath8 range .",
    "here , for all three field orientations we used the 90 % criteria , or the onset of the resistive transition in order to avoid any possible influence from phases related to vortex matter .",
    "nevertheless , for fields along the needle - axis we also included points corresponding to the middle point of the resistive transition ( brown markers ) , or the 50 % criterium , to indicate that such anomalous linear dependence can not be attributed to superconducting fluctuations .",
    "for @xmath85axis , one observes non - saturation of @xmath86 when @xmath70 approaches or surpasses the value of the pauli limiting field @xmath87 which in the weak coupling regime , or for @xmath88 , leads to @xmath89 t which is smaller than the measured value . here",
    ", @xmath90 reflects the strength of the electron - phonon or of the electron - boson coupling .",
    "this observation contrasts with what is expected for singlet pairing ; for dirty and nearly isotropic superconductors ( single crystal _",
    "x_-ray diffraction indeed indicates a sizeable amount of site disorder ) the influence of a reduced mean free path is usually described through the maki - de gennes relation @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the digamma function and @xmath93 the diffusion constant , with @xmath22 being the electronic coefficient in the heat - capacity and @xmath94 the residual resistivity .",
    "in contrast to what is seen here , such expression leads to a saturation of the upper - critical fields at temperatures well below @xmath9 see , for example , ref . .",
    "in fe pnictide superconductors one observes a similar linear dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 for fields along certain orientations , but not for _ all _ orientations , which was claimed to result from the orbital limiting effect @xcite .",
    "a linear dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 was also observed in few layered transition metal dichalcogenides for fields applied perpendicularly to the conducting planes @xcite and described in terms of a phenomenological two - dimensional ginzburg - landau model : @xmath95 where @xmath96 correspond to the quantum of flux and @xmath97 to an average in - plane ginzburg - landau coherence length at @xmath98 k. nevertheless , it is seemingly unphysical for a bulk single - crystal to display two - dimensional superconductivity for every orientation of an external magnetic field .",
    "the contrast in phase - diagrams between ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 and nb@xmath34pd@xmath21s@xmath99 , with both compounds being characterized by disorder and as seen below multi - band superconductivity , is at odds with the scenario proposed by ref . to explain this linear dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "instead , it might indicate that ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 is orbital - limited over the entire temperature range , or equivalently that the pauli limiting field has been renormalized to higher values due to correlations , i.e. @xmath100 as seen in strongly coupled superconductors .",
    "this is supported by a ginzburg - landau analysis of @xmath101 as a function of @xmath102 in the vicinity of @xmath9 ( similar plots and related discussion can be found in refs . ) which yield unreasonably high values for the pauli limiting field . finally , the mild dependence on temperature of the superconducting anisotropy @xmath103 as seen in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) suggests multi - band superconductivity as previously argued @xcite for nb@xmath104pd@xmath21s@xmath105 and nb@xmath34pd@xmath21s@xmath99 . at the lowest temperatures a @xmath106 is comparable to @xmath107 previously obtained for nb@xmath34pd@xmath21s@xmath99 .",
    "for nb@xmath34pd@xmath21s@xmath99 single - crystals , with a middle point @xmath30 k , the phase - boundary between the superconducting and the metallic states for fields applied perpendicularly to the needle - axis behave quite similarly to those displaying a @xmath108 k , namely a linear dependence on @xmath8 followed by saturation of the @xmath7s at the lowest temperatures .",
    "roughly , the @xmath7s between both sets of samples scale linearly with @xmath9 .",
    "notice how for both sets of samples , and for fields nearly along the @xmath71-axis , @xmath109 for @xmath110 already surpasses the pauli limiting value .",
    "orange lines are fits to the ginzburg - landau expression : @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the reduced temperature and @xmath113 is the coherence length along the @xmath72 , or @xmath84 , or @xmath71 axis .",
    "as seen , @xmath114s for fields applied perpendicularly to the needle - axis , can be well - described by conventional behavior , albeit leading to @xmath115 for fields applied along the @xmath74axis .",
    "the observed saturation in @xmath7s seen at the lowest @xmath8s clearly indicates that nb@xmath34pd@xmath21s@xmath99 is a pauli limited superconductor .",
    "in contrast , for fields along the @xmath20axis we observe a fast increase of @xmath7 as @xmath8 is lowered with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "we observed this behavior in 3 crystals with @xmath9s approaching 3.5 k ; for both samples whose raw data are displayed in fig .",
    "3 ( d ) and which were used to build the extended phase - boundary ( black markers ) shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) , and a third sample ( diamonds ) measured in the vicinity of @xmath9 . notice that for this orientation @xmath86 does _ not _ saturate but increases as the @xmath8 is lowered , contrasting markedly with what is observed for fields along the @xmath72-axis .",
    "magenta line is a fit to the phenomenological two - dimensional ginzburg - landau expression used to describe @xmath116 for fields along the planes of ultra - thin crystals of transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite : @xmath117    where @xmath118 corresponds to the effective thickness of the superconducting layers . as discussed in ref .",
    "this expression can be derived from eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the vicinity of @xmath9 by modifying it to describe not the pair - breaking effect produced by impurities but the pauli pair breaking effect .",
    "remarkably , this expression fits the data over the entire @xmath8 range , indicating that for fields along the @xmath20axis nb@xmath34pd@xmath21s@xmath99 behaves is if it was a two - dimensional superconductor , or as if the spins were locked at a direction perpendicular to the @xmath84-axis through a strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "further evidence for two - dimensional superconductivity is provided by the superconducting anisotropy @xmath22 which seemingly  diverges \" as one approaches @xmath9 , while displaying at the lowest @xmath8s the same value @xmath107 previously observed in the lower @xmath9 samples . for @xmath119 t ,",
    "one obtains @xmath120 @xmath62 .",
    "if one assumed that the effective thickness of the superconducting slabs was comparable to the lattice constant along the @xmath74axis @xcite or 21.0370  , one would obtain that @xmath97 would extend over @xmath121 lattice constants along the @xmath73axis .",
    "the fermi surface of all of the pd - chalcogenide based superconductors is quite similar , that is composed of quasi - one - dimensional and two - dimensional sheets along with three - dimensional fermi surface networks , see fig . 5 for the fermi surface of ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 resulting from the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations discussed below , and also refs . .",
    "therefore , it would be quite difficult to explain the marked differences between the phase - diagrams of nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 and ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 based solely on their similar crystallography and electronic structures at the fermi level .",
    "however , and as previously mentioned , in transition metal dichalcogenides the strong spin - orbit interaction is known to split the valence and the conduction bands aligning or  locking \" the spins of the charge carriers along a direction perpendicular to the conducting planes with each spin - orbit split sub - band developing a spin texture , namely spins pointing in opposite directions at the @xmath122 and @xmath123 valleys .",
    "this moderately large , and valley - dependent , zeeman - like spin splitting in the vicinity of the @xmath122 points , would protect singlet cooper pairing among carriers originally located at the @xmath122 and @xmath123 valleys : each carrier would have a locked , out of the plane spin polarization of opposite polarity .",
    "this inter - valley ising like pairing is claimed , by the authors of refs . , to enhance their upper critical fields well beyond the bcs pauli limiting field .",
    "perhaps a similar scenario might be applicable to nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 and also to the nb@xmath12pd@xmath1(se , s)@xmath16 series , namely ising pairing among carriers that have their spins locked along a direction perpendicular to the @xmath20axis , probably along the @xmath124 or @xmath72-axis ( since both systems display the lowest @xmath7s along this orientation ) , due to strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "similarly to the transition metal dichalcogenide single - layers , this would explain the extremely large values of @xmath86 observed in the pd based superconductors , which far exceed their pauli limiting field .",
    "such scenario might explain why nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 would have a relatively higher value of @xmath86 in the limit of zero temperature , i.e. @xmath125 t versus @xmath126 t for nb@xmath12pd@xmath1s@xmath16 , given their relative @xmath9s of @xmath52 k and @xmath127 k , respectively .",
    "nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 has a slightly higher content of nb relative to the chalcogen element with se being heavier than s thus leading to a potentially stronger spin - orbit coupling . in this scenario ,",
    "if ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 was not an orbital limited superconductor characterized by higher values of @xmath113 relative to nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 , it should have displayed even higher values of @xmath86 . in this respect , and in order to understand the role of spin - orbit coupling , we evaluated the effect of so - coupling on the band structure of both compounds through dft calculations using the wien2k implementation .",
    "we find that the bands of ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 are in general more dispersive and , not surprisingly , exhibit stronger so - splitting than those of nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "6 . there is a relatively flat band in ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 that crosses the fermi level ; it has primarily pd - character hybridized with te and might therefore be expected to exhibit reasonably strong spin - orbit effects due to the two heavy elements , see fig .",
    "6 . however , our calculations with and without the so term show that there is nearly no effect at all on this band , though so - splitting can be seen in other ( ta / te - derived ) bands and cause small changes in the fermi surfaces . in nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 , on the other hand , the effects of the spin - orbit are much smaller and are not even visible to the eye at the fermi energy , despite the heavy pd - character of most bands crossing @xmath128 . therefore , the ising - like pairing scenario driven by so - coupling does not seem to be appropriate for the superconducting state of the pd chalcogenides .",
    "in addition , by analyzing fig .",
    "6 one realizes that one can not find , for either compound , two nearly degenerate minima ( or  valleys \" ) in the conduction band(s ) ( or two nearly degenerate maxima in the valence band(s ) ) which should , in the ising pairing scenario , be located at high symmetry points and provide the charge carriers for pairing .",
    "from the perspective of the proximity to magnetism both compounds behave differently .",
    "first , the nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 is already near a magnetic instability . in our calculations ,",
    "a spin - polarized state with small moments on some of the nb ions is lower in energy than a spin - unpolarized state , though an ordered state is not observed in experiment .",
    "this kind of discrepancy is often a sign of disordered local moments ( paramagnetism ) . in ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 ,",
    "the energetic ground state is fully non - magnetic .",
    "in addition to the standard spin - orbit coupling term , we can also gauge the response to an external magnetic field by adding a term of the form @xmath129 to the potential , where @xmath130 is the angular momentum and @xmath131 the spin .",
    "this field is applied only within spheres drawn around each constituent ion ( consistent with our muffin - tin methodology ) and the resulting orbital moments are calculated within the same sphere .",
    "similarly , a spin moment is calculated within the sphere , but because polarization of the charge does not require an evaluation of orbital occupancy , we can also gauge the spin response of the interstitial charge , _",
    "i.e. _ that charge which can not be assigned to any given site .",
    "we apply this field along three directions : along the _ b_-axis (  _ b_-axis \" ) , perpendicular to the _ b_-axis along the nb - se chain direction (  chain \" ) and perpendicular to the _ b_-axis along the interchain direction (  interchain \" ) .    in nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2",
    ", there is a clear spin response and an anisotropic orbital response to the field .",
    "regardless of field direction , the nb(1 ) and nb(2 ) atoms carry a local spin moment of @xmath132 @xmath133 and the nb(3 ) atom that sits nearest the pd(2 ) sites carries almost no moment at all .",
    "the se ions are spin- and orbital - unpolarized .",
    "the pd sites show an intriguing anisotropy in orbital moment polarization .",
    "both pd sites have a _",
    "c2/m _ square planar symmetry , and each site shows a much stronger tendency toward orbital polarization when the field points perpendicular the plane of the square . for pd(1 )",
    "the easy field direction is the  _",
    "b_-axis \" direction where an orbital moment of @xmath134 @xmath133 forms in response to the applied field , compared to @xmath135 @xmath133 in the other two directions .",
    "the pd(2 ) sites are oriented perpendicularly such that the easy field direction is approximately along the  chain \" direction .",
    "both pd sites carry a spin moment of less than 0.1 @xmath133 with no noticeable anisotropy as a function of field direction .",
    "the increase in orbital polarization as a function of the field is likely to pin the spin moment to the lattice and hence contribute to the high upper critical fields .",
    "in contrast , the overall response of ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 to the applied field is very different from that of nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 : none of ions carry a significant spin moment and the orbital moment on pd is almost entirely anisotropic .",
    "the interstitial spin moment is very close to that of nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 at @xmath136 @xmath133/f.u . and the orbital moments on the ta ions are approximately @xmath134 @xmath133 ( identical to the nb ) .",
    "the pd ions have a spin moment of @xmath137 @xmath133 and an orbital moment of @xmath138 @xmath133 , almost identical to the values found for pd in nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "however , the orbital response of the pd ions in ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 is insensitive to the field direction .",
    "it should be noted that there is a slight tendency for the interstitial charge to spin - polarize more strongly when the field is along the @xmath139-axis , with the moment growing to @xmath140 @xmath133/f.u .",
    "the smaller spin - orbit coupling , particularly near the fermi energy , combined with the larger spin response to the application of a magnetic field , suggests that nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 might have a smaller critical field ratio than ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 , and yet we see precisely the opposite in our experiments .",
    "hence , we are led to conclude that the strength of the spin - orbit coupling and proximity to magnetism is of little relevance for the superconducting phase - diagram of ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 further supporting the orbital - limiting scenario over the entire temperature range .",
    "it is tempting to tie both the variation in the superconducting temperature as a function of pd content and the anisotropy and strength of @xmath7 to the strongly anisotropic ( 2d ) orbital response of the pd ions . to gauge the effect of changing pd content on the system",
    ", we doubled the unit cell and removed one of the pd(2 ) atoms from the compound .",
    "this results in nb@xmath0pd@xmath141se@xmath2 , a lower pd content than our model compound nb@xmath0pdse@xmath2 and also lower than the observed stoichiometry of nb@xmath0pd@xmath142se@xmath29 . nonetheless , we believe that the trends seen in this calculation should mirror the effects of variation of the pd(2 ) content in real materials .",
    "interestingly , very little changes overall with the decreased pd content .",
    "the previously unpolarized nb(3 ) ion gains a small amount of spin polarization , while all other nb , pd(1 ) , and se spin and orbital moments are indistinguishable from the original ( high pd content ) calculation .",
    "the remaining pd(2 ) ion , however , loses nearly all of its spin polarization , but retains most of the orbital polarization .",
    "two - dimensional superconductivity in nb@xmath0pd@xmath142se@xmath29 could result from weakly - coupled superconducting planes which are themselves formed by chains composed of square - planar and trigonal - prismatic se polyhedra approximately centered around the pd and the nb atoms , see fig . 3 in ref .",
    "these planes are connected just by square coordinated pd(2 ) atoms , whose molar fraction is non - stoichiometric .",
    "in addition , one would expect that the excess se @xmath143 became interstitial se randomly placed in between adjacent planes acting perhaps as pair - breaking impurities .",
    "unconventional superconductors are particularly susceptible to non - magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "hence , given the experimental evidence , we speculate that the cooper pair coherence length is rather anisotropic but becomes comparable to the inter - planar distance at low @xmath8s .",
    "nevertheless , we do not have an explanation for the lack of saturation in the @xmath86s of nb@xmath0pd@xmath1se@xmath2 which is observed in the _ same _ compound @xcite when it displays lower @xmath9s .",
    "it is tempting to attribute this lack of saturation to a possible lack of local inversion symmetry , which is indeed observed on the pd sites of ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 which displays a @xmath144 instead of the @xmath76 symmetry .",
    "lack of inversion symmetry , which leads to an asymmetric spin - orbit coupling , was claimed to minimize the role of the pauli limiting effect in spin - singlet superconductors @xcite and even to an admix of spin - singlet and spin - triplet superconducting pairing channels @xcite .",
    "however , the nb compound preserves inversion symmetry while the contrasting behavior as a function of the pd stoichiometry suggests instead a possible change in the superconducting pairing symmetry probably triggered by the rapid increase in superconducting anisotropy .",
    "the correlation of @xmath9 with the decrease in superconducting and/or electronic anisotropy is difficult to reconcile with conventional @xmath25wave pairing .",
    "insofar , contradictory evidence for unconventional pairing has only been reported for the ta@xmath3pd@xmath0te@xmath4 compound @xcite , but a similar crystalline space group and an akin electronic structure suggests that unconventional superconductivity is a possibility for all of the pd and chalcogenide based superconductors .",
    "unconventional superconductivity is further supported by the anomalous temperature dependence of the upper critical fields reported in this manuscript .",
