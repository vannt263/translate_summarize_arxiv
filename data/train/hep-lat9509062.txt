    "we have to go back to the late eighties@xcite to find the first evidence for the existence of a phase transition separating the crumpled and smooth regimes in mathematical models of surfaces defined on a mesh with fixed connectivity",
    ". however , the actual values of the critical exponents associated to this phase transition remain largely unknown .",
    "their determination is crucial to identify which type of conformal theory one gets in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "two recent numerical simulations report the following values for the critical exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in @xcite a direct measuremt of the correlation length",
    "gives @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( the latter is obtained via scaling relations ) .",
    "a direct measurement of the finite size scaling of the specific heat gives @xmath6 , in agreement with the previous values .",
    "in @xcite finite size scaling gives @xmath7 , that is @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "however these values do not agree with a direct fit to the specific heat results on large lattices ( up to @xmath10 ) , which tend to give much lower values for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "virtually nothing is known of the other critical exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which can not be deduced from @xmath3 and @xmath2 alone using scaling relations .",
    "the most interesting one is perhaps @xmath11 , the anomalous dimension of the field @xmath13 that describes the position of the surface .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath14 is related to @xmath11 via the relation @xmath15 . sometimes in random surface theory",
    "the field anomalous dimension is introduced through the tangent - tangent two - point function . if we denote the corresponding anomalous dimension by @xmath16 it follows that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    in this note",
    "we present our preliminary results concerning the above critical exponents obtained via the monte carlo renormalization group .",
    "the action we shall study is    @xmath19    with the sums extending over all pair of neighbouring sites ( @xmath20 ) and triangles ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "@xmath22 is the normal vector to the @xmath23-th triangle .",
    "sites and triangles live on a two dimensional triangulated surface of fixed connectivity embedded in @xmath24 .",
    "recently we proposed a method of implementing the renormalization group ideas directly in momentum space@xcite .",
    "it works very well in @xmath25 yielding critical exponents at the wilson fixed point with a precision comparable , if not better , to any other technique we know of .",
    "extremely long autocorrelation times difficult the application of local monte carlo algorithms to the problem at hand . for a @xmath10 system autocorrelation times can be as large as @xmath26 sweeps@xcite.to cure these difficulties a fourier accelerated langevin algorithm was proposed in @xcite and used in random surfaces in e.g. @xcite .",
    "fourier acceleration works best if the langevin equation is transformed to @xmath27-space .",
    "it is therefore natural to attempt a blocking procedure in momentum space directly .",
    "the renormalization group transformation that we use is probably the simplest one ; we just discard half the fourier modes in each direction .",
    "the interested reader may wish to consult @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the method , here we shall dwell on the details specific to random surfaces .    in fourier accelerated langevin algorithms one uses the freedom to select the two - point function for the gaussian stochastic noise that best serves the purpose of updating the different fourier modes efficiently .",
    "@xmath28    for a free field theory the choice @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the inverse correlation length of the system , works best .",
    "this also seems to be a good choice for @xmath25 .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that an effective action that describes many features of random surfaces is @xmath31 and thus it would seem that    @xmath32    with @xmath30 being again the inverse correlation length , would be a sensible choice for @xmath33 ( actually , of course , the lattice transcription of the above ) .",
    "this expectation is not borne out by actual simulations , however .",
    "it turns out to be nearly impossible to get good convergence of the method if one uses the actual inverse correlation length .",
    "we have found more convenient to select a relatively large value for the mass , such as @xmath34 which seems to provide a good balance between the need to update efficiently the slow modes and the need to keep their stochastic excursions in check .",
    "most of the results we present below are obtained with this value for @xmath30 .",
    "a potentially more serious drawback of the method is the following .",
    "when we update the position of the variable on the @xmath35-th site we have to compute    @xmath36    if it just happens that @xmath37 is small , the field variable will receive a large kick .",
    "because the resulting configuration is far from the classical trajectory , it will be promptly brought back to order by the langevin algorithm itself , but such an unphysical large fluctuation spoils the statistical samples .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is a problem associated to the finiteness of the langevin step and not an intrinsic difficulty of our system .",
    "one can indeed easily check that reducing the langevin step reduces these off - equilibrium excursions , but there is a limit to the reduction of the time step as this also increases the autocorrelation times . to alleviate this problem",
    "we modify the action in the following form    @xmath38    table 1 illustrates the dependence of the results on the parameter @xmath39 for fixed values of @xmath40 .",
    "some observables can be calculated exactly and so we know when the method reproduces the right results .",
    "we have also analyzed the volume dependence of @xmath39 .     ? = ?",

    "the longest autocorrelation time is always that of the gyration radius , but we present results for a fairly characteristic one , namely that of the extrinsic curvatute @xmath42 .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath40 .",
    "( the dependence on @xmath39 for two values of @xmath30 is also illustrated  there is virtually none . ) . as expected @xmath43 . in view of what we know about the extremely long autocorrelation times in local monte carlo",
    "algorithms the present autocorrelation times are truly impressive .",
    "= 0.40    one point that practitioners of the langevin algorithm always have to bear in mind is that the method is exact only in the @xmath44 limit .",
    "indeed the equilibrium distribution is not the one corresponding to @xmath45 but rather to    @xmath46    even after tunning @xmath39 , some systematic errors remain .",
    "fortunately they can be reduced by working with a small enough value of @xmath40 .",
    "yet @xmath40 has to be large enough so that we get reasonably short autocorrelation times and manage to sample configuration space .",
    "after a careful analysis we have settled for @xmath47 as the optimal value .",
    "the renormalization of the parameters in @xmath48 is negligible with this value for @xmath40 .",
    "a detailed analysis will be provided elsewhere .",
    "( alternatively , one could work with a second order langevin algorithm , where errors are at least of @xmath49 .",
    "we have tried this , but found no real gain . )",
    "now we proceed to discuss the essence of the method . to determine the critical exponent @xmath3 we need to determine ( see e.g. @xcite ) the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath50 that linearizes the renormalization group transformation in the vicinity of the fixed point associated to the crumpling transition . in practice truncation in the number of operators",
    "is required .",
    "we have considered a total of nine operators . in continuum notation",
    "they are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and those constructed with    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    and having dimension @xmath60 .    ",

    "needs the field anomalous dimension @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath11 is determined by demanding that at the fixed point the renormalized and bare actions coincide .",
    "it is of course unlikely that the fixed point of this renormalization group transformation lies just in the plane spanned by the two operators of the bare action .",
    "however we can assess whether we are close to it by adjusting @xmath11 and seeing how good the agreement between the renormalized and the bare observables is .",
    "table 2 illustrates this point in a @xmath61 blocking .",
    "similar results are obtained in @xmath62 . for comparison some results for @xmath25 around the wilson fixed point",
    "are also shown .",
    "we conclude that we are still at some distance from the fixed point and that a second renormalization is probably necessary .",
    "( if we are close enough to the critical surface the flow should drive us closer to the fixed point . )",
    "it is a very pleasant surprise that the results turn out to be extremely sensitive to the value of @xmath11 used to match the ` big ' and ` small ' lattices . our results from running on a variety of values of @xmath63 in the vicinity of the crumpling transition with large statistics , both in",
    "the crumpled and the smooth phases and on a variety of systems lead us to conclude that @xmath64 . from the first blocking transformation .",
    "our results from the second blocking are still very tentative and we have only results for the @xmath65 blocking , the final lattice being undoubtedly too small .",
    "even so , we get a value @xmath66 , not too far from the one obtained in the first blocking . from these two results",
    "we conclude that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    as for @xmath3 ,",
    "table 3 shows the result of the blocking @xmath69 .",
    "the second blocking yields very stable results .",
    "should we use these values we would get @xmath70 , but we shall not even quote error bars here as these results are still very preliminary . yet , they show considerable promise , specially because the computational effort required is relatively small . to mention some figures , to get the above numbers requires about 1.5 hours on a cray ymp or about 5 hours on a sgi power challenge l."
