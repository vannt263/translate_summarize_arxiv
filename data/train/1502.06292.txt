    "the uncertainty principle is one of the most remarkable characteristics of quantum theory , which the classical theory does not abide by . the first formulation of the uncertainty principle was achieved by heisenberg @xcite , that is the renowned inequality @xmath1 , which comes from the concept of indeterminacy of simultaneously measuring the canonically conjugate quantities position and momentum of a single particle .",
    "later , robertson generalized this uncertainty relation to two arbitrary observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xcite @xmath4 where the standard deviation , i.e. the square root of the variance , is defined to be @xmath5 for observables @xmath6 and the commutator @xmath7 \\equiv ab - ba$ ] .",
    "the relation ( [ robertson ] ) reflects that the standard deviations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are bounded by the expectation value of their commutator in a given quantum state of the system .",
    "however , this expectation value can be zero , even for observables that are incompatible , and makes the inequality trivial . to address this problem",
    "the uncertainty relation was expressed in terms of shannon entropies @xcite , where an improved version takes the following form @xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the eigenbasis @xmath10 in the measuring system , and similarly is the @xmath11 .",
    "the bound @xmath12 is the eigenbases maximum overlap of operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and therefore is independent of the state of system .",
    "the progress in the study of uncertainty relation has profound significance on the formalism of quantum mechanics(qm ) and far reaching consequences in quantum information sciences , e.g. , providing the quantum separability criteria @xcite , determining the quantum nonlocality @xcite ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty principle has been the focus of modern physics for decades .    for variance - based uncertainty relations , improvements",
    "designated for mixed states had been proposed with strengthened but state dependent lower bounds @xcite . despite the progress on getting stronger uncertainty relations @xcite , the problem that the lower bounds depend on the state of the system remains @xcite . on the other hand , by proposing new measures of uncertainties similar as that of entropy , state independent lower bounds could be obtained @xcite .",
    "there was also the combination approach involving both the entropic measures and variances in a single uncertainty relation , where only a nearly optimal lower bound could be derived @xcite .",
    "hence , obtaining the state independent optimal trade - off uncertainty relation for variances of physical observables is still an urgent and open question .    in this work",
    ", we present a new type of uncertainty relation for multiple physical observables , which is applicable in cases of both pure and mixed quantum states . our strategy to obtain",
    "the uncertainty relation includes three steps : first decompose the quantum state of system and physical observables in bloch space ; then express the variances of observables as functions of relative angles between bloch vectors ; last , apply triangle inequalities to these angles to get constraint functions for the variances of observables , which may remarkably give out the state independent optimal trade - off uncertainty relations .",
    "in quantum theory , the systems are generally described by density matrices , which are hermitian , and physical observables are represented by operator matrices , which are also hermitian .",
    "the uncertainty of an observable @xmath2 for the physical system represented by matrix @xmath13 is measured by the variance @xmath14 - \\mathrm{tr}[a\\rho]^2 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq - variance - def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here tr is the trace of a matrix .",
    "note that the variance @xmath15 are invariant under a substraction of constant diagonal matrix from @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath16 with @xmath17 being any real number and @xmath18 is the identity matrix .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality we are legitimate to consider observables of traceless hermitian operators .    the @xmath19 unitary matrices with determinant 1 form the special unitary group of degree @xmath0 , denoted by su(@xmath0 ) .",
    "there are @xmath20 traceless hermitian matrices @xmath21 of dimension @xmath19 , which constitute the generators of su(@xmath0 ) group @xmath22 = 2i\\sum_{l=1}^{n^2 - 1 } f_{jkl}\\lambda_{l } \\ ; , \\ ; \\{\\lambda_{j},\\lambda_{k}\\ } = \\frac{4}{n}\\delta_{jk}i + 2\\sum_{l=1}^{n^2 - 1 } d_{jkl } \\lambda_{l } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bracket represents the commutator and the anti - commutator is defined to be @xmath23 ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are symmetric and anti - symmetric structure constants of su(@xmath0 ) group , respectively .",
    "any @xmath19 hermitian matrix may be decomposed in terms of these generators @xcite , including quantum states and system observables , i.e. @xmath26 here , @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] . in this form ,",
    "the @xmath19 hermitian matrices @xmath2 and @xmath13 may be represented by the @xmath20 dimensional real vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the components of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "the quantity @xmath35 may be regarded as a measure of the degree of pureness of quantum state . for pure state @xmath36 , while for completely mixed state @xmath37 .    substituting ( [ eq - rho - a - decompose ] ) into ( [ eq - variance - def ] ) , the variance of observable @xmath2 for the quantum state @xmath13 may be rewritten as @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the variance now is completely characterized by the angles between the vector @xmath30 associated with the quantum state @xmath13 and vectors @xmath40 and @xmath29 associated with the hermitian operator @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . in the appendix a section , a general configuration for bloch vectors of variances will be given .    in 2-dimensional hilbert space , the bloch vector forms of the quantum state @xmath13 and observables @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath43 may be represented by 3-dimensional real vectors @xmath30 , @xmath29 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , respectively . in this case , the su(2 ) generators @xmath21 are pauli matrices @xmath46 , @xmath47 . from equation ( [ eq - deviation - express ] ) , the variances of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath43 become @xmath48 here , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are the angles between @xmath29 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath30 , see figure [ fig-2 - 3-angles ] . note that @xmath52 due to the fact that the symmetric structure constants are all zero in su(2 ) . as the inversion of a vector , e.g. ,",

    ", we have @xmath63 and equation ( [ eq - qubit - ab ] ) leads to @xmath64 this is equivalent to that @xmath65 , @xmath66 . for pure states of @xmath67 , equation ( [ eq - qubit - ab ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath68 if we further assume @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are arbitrary unit vectors , then @xmath73 here @xmath55 is the angle between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig - shaded ] illustrates the trade - off relations between the variances of @xmath15 and @xmath74 for four different values of @xmath55 .    to compare with the existing uncertainty relations in the market , we exploit a recent appeared uncertainty relation with state dependent lower bound as an example @xcite .",
    "it reads , @xmath75|\\psi\\rangle +    with @xmath76 .",
    "suppose in qubit system @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the angles between observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xmath80 , equation ( [ eq - compare ] ) then tells @xmath81|\\psi\\rangle +    while our constraint relation ( [ eq - nanb ] ) gives @xmath82 which can be read directly from figure [ fig - shaded](c ) .",
    "our result ( [ li - comp ] ) is quantum state independent and gives not only the lower bound , but also a span for @xmath83 , which is obviously superior to ( [ pati - comp ] ) .",
    "moreover , generally speaking the equation ( [ eq - compare ] ) is not applicable to mixed states @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 , since there is no quantum state that could be orthogonal to all the @xmath87 in @xmath0-dimensional system @xcite .",
    "when three obervables @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath43 are considered , their variances under the quantum state @xmath13 are characterized by three angles @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , see also figure [ fig-2 - 3-angles ] .",
    "because only two of these angles are free in 3-dimensional real space , we have the following proposition :    for three independent observables in 2-dimensional hilbert space , the trade - off relation for the variances of observables turn out to be an equality.[proposition-3observables ]    as the validity of proposition [ proposition-3observables ] is quite obvious , we only present a simple example as a demonstration of proof . suppose three observables are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , or in the bloch vector form @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "an arbitrary quantum state may be constructed as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , @xmath96 are the polar and azimuthal angles in the 3-dimensional real space . for pure states of @xmath97 , substituting the values of @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 into equations ( [ eq - delta - a ] ) , ( [ eq - delta - b ] ) and ( [ eq - delta - c ] ) , one then has the following trade - off relation for @xmath15 , @xmath74 , and @xmath101 , @xmath102 here , @xmath55 will always be a constant as long as the observable @xmath3 is given .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the uncertainty relation of equation ( [ eq - nanb ] ) can be obtained by projecting the `` certainty '' relation ( [ eq - three - correlated ] ) onto the @xmath103-@xmath83 plane with @xmath104 .    in general , by expressing quantum states and physical observables in bloch space , the state independent uncertainty relation involving several observables",
    "may be constructed . for the pure qubit system",
    ", the variances of incompatible observables ( not only pairwise ) can not be zero simultaneously , due to the fact that the quantum state of system in the vector form @xmath30 can not simultaneously parallel to those unparallel vectors ( incompatible observables , @xmath29 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) .",
    "this pictorial illustration is quite instructive , which gives the succinct geometrical account for the uncertainty relations of variances .",
    "there are two types of relations pertaining to the uncertainty principle , i.e. , the uncertainty relation and the measurement disturbance relation ( mdr ) @xcite .",
    "while the uncertainty relation involves the ensemble properties of variances , the mdr relates the measurement precision to its back actions , which is currently a hot topic @xcite . though being fundamentally different , the uncertainty relation and the mdr are both shown to be correlated with the quantum nonlocality @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that every new forms of uncertainty relations may shed some light on the study of the connection between uncertainty principle and quantum nonlocality .",
    "to summarize , we presented a new type of uncertainty relation which completely characterizes the trade - off relations among the variances of several physical obervables for both pure and mixed quantum systems .",
    "it provides the state independent optimal bounds not only for the variances of pairwise incompatible observables , but also for the multiple incompatible observables . unlike the prevailing uncertainty relations in the literature , our bounds for the variances of observables are immune from the `` triviality '' problem of having null expectation value . as a heuristic example",
    ", we showed , geometrically , that our uncertainty relation turns out to be an equality for variances of 3 independent observables in 2-dimensional hilbert space , and pairwise inequalities are merely the corresponding projections of this equality , which looks enlightening for the understanding of the complementarity principle in qm .    *",
