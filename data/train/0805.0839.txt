    "phenomenological studies of the observed jet quenching depend crucially on our theoretical understanding of parton propagation and energy loss in dense medium which is dominated by induced gluon radiation via multiple scattering .",
    "there have been , therefore , a plethora of theoretical studies of induced gluon emission from a propagating parton @xcite .",
    "one approach to the study of induced gluon emission is based on higher - twist expansion of multiple parton scattering cross section in a nuclear medium in the framework of collinear factorization approximation @xcite which can also be applied to parton propagation in hot medium .",
    "the advantage of higher - twist approach is the natural formulation of the parton propagation problem in terms of medium modified parton fragmentation function which is the only physical observable of the jet quenching as a result of induced gluon emission and parton energy loss .",
    "the higher - twist approach to the problem of induced gluon emission is so far limited to twist - four contributions in the twist expansion .",
    "this is equivalent to the leading order approximation in the opacity expansion approach by gyulassy , levai and vitev ( glv ) @xcite .",
    "the induced gluon spectra from these two approaches can be shown to be equivalent under the twist and opacity expansion approximations @xcite",
    ". however , aurenche , zakharov and zaraket ( azz ) claim in a recent note @xcite that the higher - twist approach `` fails '' to produce the correct gluon spectra as in the light - cone path integral ( lcpi ) and opacity expansion approach by gyulassy , levai and vitev ( glv ) .",
    "we want to demonstrate that such an unjustified claim comes from their confusion over the procedure and validity of the collinear expansion in the higher - twist approach . a misconstrued variable change in lcpi and glv results",
    "also lead to their conclusion on the collinear approximation in the @xmath3 factorized formulation .",
    "we demonstrate that these results under the same approximation are equivalent to each other .    for semi - inclusive cross section of induced gluon emission ,",
    "the collinear expansion in terms of the initial parton transverse momentum @xmath3 must be made for a fixed value @xmath4 of the gluon s transverse momentum .",
    "for the total parton energy loss which involves integration over the gluon s transverse momentum , we will argue that the higher - twist expansion is a good approximation for large initial jet energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the nuclear size .",
    "in the twist expansion approach to multiple parton scattering , one considers interaction between a fast parton and the target nucleus ( or hot medium ) via exchange of soft gluons as shown in fig .",

    ". one can prove in general this is true for quark interaction with any number of longitudinal gluons .",

    "this does not correspond to any physical scattering because one can get rid of it by choosing a proper ( physical ) gauge .",
    "this is the basic idea behind the proof of collinear factorization of the leading twist cross section of dis and drell - yan processes by collins , soper and sterman @xcite .",

    "the momentum fraction @xmath24 carried by the initial gluon is determined by the kinematics of each individual process .",
    "therefore , the leading twist - four contribution from the quadratic term of the collinear expansion to the semi - inclusive dis cross section has a simple form @xmath25 which has a simple and intuitive interpretation of partonic scattering between the fast quark and a _ physical collinear _ gluon since the contribution is proportional to the @xmath3-integrated gluon distribution inside the nucleus .",

    "if one works in the physical gauge ( @xmath27 ) , the gauge link along the light - cone disappears ( there will be transverse gauge link instead , see ref .",

    "one can in fact prove in general the equivalence between the collinear hard part @xmath29 in the physical gauge and the second derivative @xmath26 of the hard part in the covariant gauge @xcite .",

    "the dominant contribution comes from differentiating the factor @xmath37 .",
