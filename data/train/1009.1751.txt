    "best @xmath0-term approximation widths _",
    "@xmath14 the use of this concept goes back to schmidt @xcite and after the work of oskolkov @xcite , it was widely used in the approximation theory , cf .",
    "in fact , it is the main prototype of nonlinear approximation @xcite .",
    "it is well known , that @xmath15 the proof of is based on the simple fact , that ( roughly speaking ) the best @xmath0-term approximation error of @xmath16 is realized by subtracting the @xmath0 largest coefficients taken in absolute value .",
    "hence , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the so - called _ non - increasing rearrangement _ @xcite of the vector @xmath19 .",
    "let us recall the proof of in the simplest case , namely @xmath20 .",
    "the estimate from above then follows by @xmath21 the lower estimate is supplied by taking @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the canonical unit vectors .    for general @xmath24 , the estimate from above in",
    "may be obtained from and hlder s inequality @xmath25 the estimate from below follows for all @xmath24 s by simple modification of . + the discussion above exhibits two effects .    1",
    ".   best @xmath0-term approximation works particularly well , when @xmath26 is large , i.e. if @xmath27 and @xmath20 .",
    "the elements used in the estimate from below ( and hence the elements , where the best @xmath0-term approximation performs at worse ) enjoy a very special structure .",
    "therefore , there is a reasonable hope , that the best @xmath0-term approximation could behave better , when considered in a certain average case .",
    "but first we point out two different interesting points of view on the subject .",
    "the interest in @xmath28 spaces ( and especially in their finite - dimensional counterparts @xmath1 ) with @xmath29 was recently stimulated by the impressive success of the novel and vastly growing area of _ compressed sensing _ as introduced in @xcite . without going much into the details , we only note , that the techniques of compressed sensing allow to reconstruct a vector from an incomplete set of measurements utilizing the prior knowledge , that it is sparse , i.e. @xmath30 is small .",
    "furthermore , this approach may be applied @xcite also to vectors , which are _ compressible _ , i.e. @xmath31 is small for ( preferably small ) @xmath29 . indeed , tells us ,",
    "that such a vector @xmath32 may be very well approximated by sparse vectors .",
    "we point to @xcite for the current state of the art of this field and for further references .",
    "this leads in a very natural way to a question , which stands in the background of this paper , namely :    _ how does a typical vector of the @xmath33 unit ball look like ? _    or , posed in an exact way : _ let @xmath34 be a probability measure on the unit ball of @xmath1 .",
    "what is the mean value of @xmath35 with respect to this measure ?",
    "_ of course , the choice of @xmath34 plays a crucial role .",
    "there are several standard probability measures , which are connected to the unit ball of @xmath1 in a natural way , namely ( cf . definitions [ dfn2 ] and [ dfn3 ] )    * the normalized lebesgue measure , * the @xmath36 dimensional hausdorff measure restricted to the surface of the unit ball of @xmath1 and correspondingly normalized , * the so - called normalized cone measure .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out , that all these three measures are `` bad ''  a typical vector with respect to any of them does not involve much structure and corresponds rather to noise then signal ( in the sense described below ) . therefore , we are looking for a new type of measures ( cf . definition [ def14 ] ) , which would behave better from this point of view .",
    "random vectors play an important role in the area of signal processing .",
    "for example , if @xmath37 is a natural number , @xmath38 is a vector of independent gaussian variables and @xmath39 is a real number , then @xmath40 is a classical model of noise , namely the _",
    "white noise_. this model is used in the theory but also in the real life applications of signal processing .",
    "the random generation of a structured signal seems to be a more complicated task . probably the most common random model to generate sparse vectors , cf .",
    "@xcite , is the so - called _ bernoulli - gaussian model_. let again @xmath37 be a natural number and @xmath39 be a real number .",
    "also @xmath38 stands for a vector of independent gaussian variables .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath29 be a real number and let @xmath41 be a vector of independent bernoulli variables defined as @xmath42 the components of the random _ bernoulli - gaussian vector _",
    "@xmath43 are then defined through @xmath44 obviously , the average number of non - zero components of @xmath32 is @xmath45 unfortunately , if @xmath46 is much smaller than @xmath47 , then the concentration of the number of non - zero components of @xmath32 around @xmath46 is not very strong .",
    "this becomes better , if @xmath46 gets larger .",
    "but in that case , the model resembles more and more the model of white noise . in some sense , represents rather a randomly filtered white noise then a structured signal .",
    "it is one of the main aims of this paper to find a new measure , such that a random vector with respect to this measure would show a nearly sparse structure without the need of random filtering .",
    "let us describe the situation in the most prominent case , when @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the normalized surface measure on the unit sphere @xmath51 of @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , we denote by @xmath53 the standard gaussian measure on @xmath54 with the density @xmath55 we use polar coordinates to calculate @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the area of @xmath51 .",
    "this formula connects the expected value of @xmath58 with the expected value of maximum of @xmath47 independent gaussian variables . using that this quantity is known to be equivalent to @xmath59 , cf .",
    "* ( 3.14 ) ) , @xmath60 one obtains @xmath61 several comments on and are necessary .    *",
    "quantities similar to the left - hand side of have been used in the study of geometry of banach spaces and local theory of banach spaces since many years and are treated in detail in the work of milman @xcite .",
    "especially , if @xmath62 is a norm in @xmath54 and @xmath63 denotes the corresponding unit ball , then the quantity @xmath64 ( and the closely connected median @xmath65 of @xmath66 over @xmath51 ) plays a crucial role in the dvoretzky theorem @xcite and , in general , in the study of euclidean sections of @xmath67 , cf .",
    "* section 5 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the case of @xmath68^n$ ] , when @xmath69 is extremal , cf . @xcite . *",
    "the connection between the estimated value of a maximum of independent gaussian variables and the estimated value of the largest coordinate of a random vector on @xmath51 is given just by integration in polar coordinates and is one of the standard techniques in the local theory of banach spaces . due to the result of @xcite , this holds true also for other values of @xmath70 , even for @xmath27 , with gaussian variables replaced by variables with the density @xmath71 .",
    "this approach is nowadays classical in the study of the geometry and concentration of measure phenomenon on the @xmath1-balls , cf .",
    "@xcite . * for every @xmath72 we obtain easily that @xmath73 .",
    "estimate shows that the average value of @xmath74 over @xmath75 is asymptotically larger only by a logarithmic factor .",
    "the detailed study of the concentration of @xmath74 around its estimated value ( or its mean value ) is known as _ concentration of measure phenomena _ @xcite and gives more accurate information then the one included in . as our main interest lies in estimates of _ average best @xmath0-term widths _ , cf .",
    "definition [ dfn1 ] , we do not investigate the concentration properties in this paper and leave this subject to further research . *",
    "the calculation is based on the use of polar coordinates . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the normalized cone measure is exactly that measure , for which a similar formula holds , cf . .",
    "the estimates for @xmath36 dimensional surface measure are later obtained using its density with respect to the cone measure , cf .",
    "lemma [ lem7 ] . *",
    "as we want to keep the paper self - contained as much as possible and to make it readable also for readers without ( almost ) any stochastic background , we prefer to use simple and direct techniques .",
    "for example we use rather the simple estimates in lemma [ lem3 ] , than any of their sophisticated improvements available in literature . *",
    "the connection to random gaussian variables explains , why a random point of @xmath51 is sometimes referred to as _ white ( or gaussian ) noise_. it is usually not associated with any reasonable ( i.e. structured ) signal , rather it represents a good model for random noise .",
    "after describing the context of our work we shall now present the definition of the so - called _ average best @xmath0-term widths _ , which are the main subject of our study .",
    "first , we observe , that @xmath77 holds for every @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "also all the measures , which we shall consider , are invariant under any of the mappings @xmath80 and therefore we restrict our attention only to @xmath81 in the following definition .",
    "[ dfn1 ] let @xmath82 and let @xmath83 and @xmath84 be natural numbers .    1 .",
    "we set @xmath85 2 .",
    "let @xmath34 be a borel probability measure on @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath87 is called _ average surface best @xmath0-term width of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath34_. 3 .",
    "let @xmath88 be a borel probability measure on @xmath89\\cdot{\\delta_p^n}$ ] .",
    "then @xmath90\\cdot{\\delta_p^n } } \\sigma_m(x)_qd\\nu(x)\\ ] ] is called _ average volume best @xmath0-term width of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath88_.    let us observe , that the estimates @xmath91 follow trivially by definition [ dfn1 ] .",
    "furthermore , the mapping @xmath92 is continuous and , therefore , measurable with respect to the borel measure @xmath34 .      after introducing new notion of average best @xmath0-term width in definition [ dfn1 ] , we study its behavior for the measures on @xmath86 , which are widely used in literature . a prominent role among them",
    "is played by the so - called _ normalized cone measure _ given by @xmath93\\cdot { \\mathcal a})}{\\lambda([0,1]\\cdot { \\delta_p^n})},\\quad { \\mathcal a}\\subset{\\delta_p^n}.\\ ] ] in theorem [ thm6 ] and proposition [ prop12 ] we provide basic estimates of @xmath94 for @xmath20 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "surprisingly enough , it turns out that has its direct counterpart for all @xmath96 .",
    "this means ( as described above ) , that the coordinates of a `` typical '' element of the surface of the @xmath1 unit ball are well concentrated around the value @xmath97 .",
    "so , roughly speaking , it is only @xmath28-normalized noise .",
    "another well known probability measure on @xmath86 is the _ normalized surface measure _ @xmath98 , cf . definition [ dfn3 ] .",
    "we calculate in lemma [ lem7 ] the density of @xmath98 with respect to @xmath99 to be equal to @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the normalizing constant .",
    "this result ( which is a generalization of the work of naor and romik @xcite to the non - convex case @xmath29 ) might be of independent interest for the study of the geometry of @xmath1 spheres .",
    "one observes immediately , that if @xmath27 and one or more coordinates of @xmath102 are going to zero , then this density has a polynomial singularity and , therefore , gives more weight to areas closed to coordinate hyperplanes .",
    "we then obtain in theorem [ thm9 ] an estimate of @xmath103 from above .",
    "although the measure @xmath98 concentrates around coordinate hyperplanes , it turns out , that the estimate from above of @xmath104 as obtained in theorem [ thm6 ] and the estimate of theorem [ thm9 ] differ only in the constants involved .",
    "the last part of this paper is devoted to the search of a new probability measure on @xmath86 , which would `` promote sparsity '' in the sense , that the mean value of @xmath35 decays rapidly with @xmath0 .",
    "one possible candidate is presented in definition [ def14 ] by introducing a new class of measures @xmath105 , which are given by their density with respect to the cone measure @xmath99 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a normalising constant .",
    "we refer also to remark [ rem4 ] for an equivalent characterisation .",
    "we show , that for an appropriate choice of @xmath108 , namely @xmath109 , the estimated value of the @xmath0-th largest coefficient of elements of the @xmath1-unit sphere decays exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "namely , theorem [ thm17 ] provides estimates of @xmath110 , which at the end imply that @xmath111 for two positive real numbers @xmath112 and @xmath113 , which depend only on @xmath70 .",
    "this result ( which is also simulated numerically in the very last section of this paper ) is in a certain way independent of @xmath47 .",
    "this gives a hope , that one could apply this approach also to the infinite - dimensional spaces @xmath28 or , using a suitable discretization technique ( like wavelet decomposition ) , also to some function spaces .",
    "this remains a subject of our further research .",
    "of course , the class @xmath105 provides only one example of measures with rapid decay of their average best @xmath0-term widths .",
    "we leave also the detailed study of other measures with such properties open to future work .    * note added in the proof : * let us comment on the relation of our work with recent papers of cevher @xcite and gribonval , cevher , and davis @xcite .",
    "cevher uses in @xcite the concept of _ order statistics _",
    "@xcite to identify the probability distributions , whose independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "realizations result typically in @xmath70-compressible signals , i.e. @xmath114 our approach here is a bit different and more connected to the geometry of @xmath1 spaces . in accordance with @xcite",
    ", this leads to the study of @xmath1-_normalized _ vectors with i.i.d .",
    "this again allows us to better distinguish between the norm of such a vector ( i.e. its _ size _ or _ energy _ ) and its direction ( i.e. its _ structure _ ) .",
    "the approach of the recent preprint @xcite ( which was submitted during the review process of this work ) comes much closer to ours .",
    "their definition 1 of `` compressible priors '' introduces the quantity called _ relative best @xmath0-term approximation error _ as @xmath115 the asymptotic behavior of this quantity for @xmath43 being a vector with i.i.d .",
    "components and @xmath116 is then used to define @xmath24-compressible probability distribution functions . in contrary to @xcite",
    ", we consider @xmath117 approximation of @xmath28 normalized vectors and therefore our widths depend on two integrability parameters @xmath70 and @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we do not pose any restrictions on the ratio @xmath118 to any specific regime and consider the average best @xmath0-term widths @xmath119 for all @xmath120 in the only case , when we speak about asymptotics ( i.e. of theorem [ thm17 ] ) , we suppose @xmath0 to be constant and @xmath47 growing to infinity .",
    "furthermore , theorem 1 of @xcite shows that all distributions with bounded fourth moment do not fit into their scheme and do not `` promote sparsity '' .",
    "as we are interested in distributions , which are connected to the geometry of @xmath1-balls ( i.e. generalized gaussian distribution and generalized gamma distribution ) , it is exactly that reason why we change the parameters of the distribution @xmath105 in dependence of @xmath47 .",
    "although quite inconvenient from the mathematical point of view , it is not really clear if this presents a serious obstacle for application of our approach .",
    "but the investigation of this goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the rest of section 1 gives some notation used throughout the paper .",
    "sections 2 and 3 provide estimates of this quantity with respect to the cone and surface measure , respectively . in section 4 ,",
    "we study a new type of measures on the unit ball of @xmath1 .",
    "we show , that the typical element with respect to those measures behaves in a completely different way compared to the situations discussed before .",
    "those results are illustrated by the numerical experiments described in section 5 .",
    "we denote by @xmath121 the set of real numbers , by @xmath122 the set of nonnegative real numbers and by @xmath54 and @xmath123 their @xmath47-fold tensor products .",
    "the components of @xmath78 are denoted by @xmath124 .",

    "if @xmath127 and @xmath128 is an interval , we write @xmath129    we shall use very often the _ gamma function _ , defined by @xmath130 in one case , we shall use also the _ beta function _ @xmath131 and the _ digamma function _ @xmath132 we recommend ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) as a standard reference for both basic and more advanced properties of these functions .",
    "we shall need the stirling s approximation formula ( which was implicitly used already in ) in its most simple form @xmath133    if @xmath134 and @xmath135 are real sequences , then @xmath136 means , that there is an absolute constant @xmath137 , such that @xmath138 for all @xmath139 .",
