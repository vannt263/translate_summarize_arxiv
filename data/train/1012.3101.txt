    "electromagnetic processes have always provided invaluable probes of the strong interactions , the most prominent example being the deep inelastic scattering experiments in the early 1970s which eventually established qcd as the fundamental theory of the strong interactions . among the current challenges of qcd",
    "is the description of the plethora of charmoniumlike states discovered during the past years , the so - called  xyz \" ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , that lie above the @xmath1 threshold , and do not fit potential model expectations .",
    "it is widely accepted that the effects of the coupling of a core charmonium , namely , a mainly @xmath8 bound state , to a @xmath1 meson pair , the so - called coupled - channel effects , are an important ingredient to understand those states .",
    "we shall call the latter continuum states and the former valence states",
    ". we will argue below that two - photon transitions between heavy quarkonium states may provide important experimental information on the continuum - valence coupling .",
    "historically , it has been recognized for a long time that the continuum states may shift the mass spectrum of a pure @xmath9 state considerably @xcite . recently",
    ", exploratory investigations on the mixing between discrete and continuum states in charmonium have been carried out in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd has also provided a detailed study of the so - called  string breaking \" in the static approximation @xcite , which may be used to extract information on the continuum - valence coupling @xcite .",
    "if the heavy quark mass @xmath10 is much larger than the remaining scales in the system , then the heavy quarks move slowly in their center - of - mass frame , say with a typical velocity @xmath11 , that is , with typical three momentum @xmath12 and hence with typical binding energy @xmath13 .",
    "nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite can be used to factorize the contributions from energies larger or of the order of @xmath10 , and provides a good starting point .",
    "recall that the heavy - light meson pair threshold lies at a typical nonrelativistic energy @xmath14 , according to heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) counting rules @xcite .",
    "then , if the binding energy of a heavy quarkonium state lies much below open flavor threshold , namely , @xmath15 one can integrate out energies of order @xmath14 .",
    "this leads to potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd ) in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of this effective theory reduces to a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark interacting through a potential@xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . hence , in order to understand the properties of these states , there is no need to introduce explicitly the continuum states if the potential is chosen appropriately .",
    "however , for states close to or above the open flavor threshold , the coupling of continuum to valence states needs to be addressed , and so far it is not known how to proceed in a model independent way . , which includes coupled channel effects @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for an even more recent proposal .",
    "] hence , most of the analysis has been done by using different models .",
    "recently , some general features of the coupled - channel effects have been obtained in the quark model @xcite under the assumptions that valence - continuum coupling is described by the @xmath16 model @xcite and the interaction between two mesons is negligible .",
    "these results suggest that for the low - lying states the effect of continuum channels is hidden in the parameters in the potential model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is mentioned that the radiative transition process may be sensitive to the continuum components .",
    "however , previous works , based on cornell coupled - channel formalism , indicate that the relativistic corrections @xcite may be more important than the continuum contributions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforward to disentangle the continuum contributions in the one - photon transition process .    here , we propose a new process , namely , @xmath17 which can provide an additional opportunity to pin down the valence - continuum coupling . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "electromagnetic transitions allow a cleaner analysis than hadronic decay processes . at the amplitude level",
    ", the contribution to this two - photon transition can be divided into two parts .",
    "we refer to the first one as the discrete part , which involves charmonium states only .",
    "the discrete part is dominated by the following process : the @xmath18 state decays into a real or virtual @xmath2 state by radiating one photon , and then , the real or virtual @xmath2 state decays into @xmath7 plus another photon .",
    "this process not only includes the cascade decay process ( on - shell region ) , but also the off - shell region .",
    "we will study the whole phase space .",
    "the second part is referred to as the continuum part , in which at least one photon is emitted by an intermediate charmed meson . in the discrete part",
    ", the @xmath19 states can be on - shell , so the total contribution of the discrete subprocess should be much larger than that of the continuum part",
    ". however , when the invariant mass of @xmath7 and one of the photons is far away from the resonance regions of the @xmath19 states , the discrete part contribution will drop down very fast . thus , the contribution of the continuum part may be important and measurable in the off - shell region .",
    "let us mention that in ref .",
    "@xcite , a similar decay process of @xmath20 is suggested to determine the values of the strong couplings @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    on the experimental side ,",
    "such a two - photon transition process has already been studied in the 1970s and 1980s @xcite . in recent years",
    ", more precise measurements were carried out by the besiii @xcite and cleo @xcite collaborations .",
    "however , they focused on the investigation of the cascade decay @xmath23 followed by @xmath24 and on the study of the properties of the @xmath25 states . only in ref.@xcite ,",
    "was a discussion made on the possible amplitude of the two - photon transition in treating the backgrounds of the @xmath25 states .",
    "hence , so far , no one has ever used it to study coupled - channel effects .",
    "recently , the besiii @xcite collaboration reported the significant data excess from the known cascade backgrounds , which was interpreted as the nonresonance decay of @xmath26 .",
    "we remark that this measurement is very sensitive to the line shapes of the @xmath25 states , especially in the data selection region .",
    "because of the above reason , the significance of an eventual experimental determination of the continuous process depends very much on our knowledge on the discrete states . as far as we know ,",
    "the discrete contribution has not been fully studied yet , and only the individual contribution of each @xmath25 state is known by using the non relativistic breit - wigner formula together with the dynamical factors to describe the @xmath25 line shape in the cascade decay of @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "so , in this paper we restrict ourselves to analyze the discrete contribution to this decay assuming that the coupling of @xmath27 and @xmath7 to @xmath28 is zero , and leave for a future work , the detailed evaluation of @xmath1 meson pair loops effects .    in this work",
    ", we will use effective field theory methods to calculate the decay width , the photon spectrum , and the @xmath7 polarization in the discrete subprocess . a complete study of the whole contribution of the discrete @xmath29 states together with some higher radial excitations , @xmath4 states , where @xmath30 , are ignored .",
    "] , will be carried out .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as followings : in sec.ii , we will briefly introduce the effective lagrangian we use and determine the value of the effective couplings ; in sec.iii , we will calculate the discrete contribution to the @xmath0 process and show the results , and the discussion and summary will be given in the last section .",
    "the heavy quarkonium states are mainly constituted by a @xmath31 pair and classified according to the spectroscopic notation @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the radial quantum number , @xmath34 is the total spin of the heavy quark pair , @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) is the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath37 is the total angular momentum .",
    "they have parity @xmath38 and charge conjugation @xmath39 .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", nrqcd is a good starting point to describe this system .",
    "the lo nrqcd lagrangian is invariant under s=@xmath40 spin - symmetry group , an approximate symmetry of the heavy quarkonium states , that is inherited in the subsequent effective theories .",
    "we assume that the entire dynamics of these states can be described by a ( nonperturbative ) potential .",
    "that is the case if they are in the strong coupling regime of pnrqcd .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for the @xmath29 states @xcite , and to lesser extend for @xmath7 may well be better described by the weak coupling regime of pnrqcd @xcite . at leading order in this regime , the dynamics",
    "is described by a ( perturbative ) potential , and the multipole expansion also holds . ] .",
    "the remaining states are close to or above threshold and are subject to the uncertainties due to the influence of @xmath1 pairs , that we plan to analyze in a separate work . in any case",
    ", we will only use the fact that the typical energy of the emitted photons is at the ultrasoft scale @xmath13 , and the typical size of the system at the soft scale @xmath41 .",
    "this allows hs to carry out the multipole expansion of the photon field about the center - of - mass coordinate , which means that the photons see the heavy quarkonium states as pointlike particles .",
    "hence , it is most convenient to introduce hadronic spin - symmetry multiplets , in an analogous way as it was initially done in hqet @xcite .    for heavy quarkonium states ,",
    "this formalism was developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the states have the same radial number @xmath42 and the same orbital momentum @xmath43 can also be expressed by means of a single multiplet @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the four velocity associated to the multiplet @xmath44 ( not to be mistaken by @xmath47 , the typical velocity of the heavy quark in the heavy quarkonium rest frame ) , @xmath48 represents the spin - singlet effective field , and @xmath49,@xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the three spin - triplet effective fields with @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the four tensors are all completely symmetric and traceless and satisfy the transverse condition @xmath54 @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the properties of @xmath57 and @xmath58 under parity , charge conjugation and heavy quark spin transformations can be easily obtained by assuming that the corresponding transformation rules of the multiplet @xmath44 follow as :    @xmath59    @xmath60^{t}c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the charge conjugation matrix ( @xmath63 in the dirac representation ) , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 correspond to the heavy quark and heavy antiquark spin - symmetry groups ( @xmath66=[s^{\\prime},\\slashed{v}]=0 $ ] ) .",
    "since we are going to consider the two - photon decay of @xmath18 into @xmath67 via the intermediate states @xmath2 , it will be helpful to give the explicit expressions of the @xmath68- and @xmath69-wave multiplets that follow from eq.(1 ) . for the @xmath70 case , we have @xmath71 and for the @xmath72 case , @xmath73 the radiative transitions between @xmath74 and @xmath75 charmonium states in the nonrelativistic limit is given by the lagrangian : @xmath76v_{\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu}+\\mathrm{h.c . } , \\label{vertex}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the coupling constant , and @xmath78 is the electromagnetic tensor .",
    "the lagrangian in eq.(6 ) preserves parity , charge conjugation , gauge invariance , and heavy quark and antiquark spin symmetry .    using the effective lagrangian , it is straightforward to calculate the e1 transition decay widths :    [ e1 ] @xmath79 @xmath80 [ decays ]    where @xmath81 is the energy of the emitted photon .",
    "the results are slightly different from those given in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is because the initial and final charmonium states can not be static simultaneously , and we choose different values of @xmath82 for them to maintain the transverse condition in eq.([trans ] ) .",
    "namely , in the vertex ( [ vertex ] ) we have substituted the velocity @xmath83 in the current that produces the outgoing particle by @xmath84 , its four velocity .",
    "the remaining velocities ( i.e. the explicit one and the one in the current that annihilates the incoming particle ) are chosen as @xmath85 , the four velocity of the incoming particle .",
    "the explicit calculations in ( [ decays ] ) show that these changes maintain the spin - symmetry ratios between the decay widths of the different states ( provided that the same mass is used for each spin multiplet ) .",
    "note that @xmath86 , and the results of ref.@xcite differ from ours by @xmath87 contributions . in ( [ decays ] )",
    "we have also allowed the coupling constant @xmath77 of the spin - symmetry multiplet to depend on the total angular momentum @xmath37 , namely , @xmath88 . in this way we are accounting for spin - symmetry breaking terms due to the spin - orbit , spin - spin and tensor potentials in pnrqcd ( or in potential models ) .",
    "note that although spin - breaking terms look like an @xmath89 in nrqcd ( like in hqet ) , this is actually the case only when ultrasoft particles are emitted , for instance , in magnetic transitions , or in processes involving pseudo - goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "soft emissions can only be virtual and lead to the above mentioned @xmath90 spin - breaking potentials , which make the coupling constants different at this order . in conventional potential models , the differences between @xmath91 are usually taken to be of order @xmath92 , although on general grounds they could be as large as order @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "@xmath77 can , in principle , be obtained by calculating the matrix element of the electromagnetic current between the wave functions of the @xmath75 and @xmath74 states in pnrqcd ( or in any potential model , see ref.@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "nowadays they can also be obtained from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "here we will determine their values using experimental data , except for those related to the @xmath4 for which experimental data is not available . in the last case the values will be estimated using a potential model . for the @xmath5 case ,",
    "the @xmath93 and @xmath94 processes have been measured with a very high precision @xcite , so we can determine the values of the relevant coupling constants by comparing with the experimental results . using the pdg data @xcite , @xmath95gev , @xmath96gev , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and    @xmath100",
    "@xmath101    @xmath102    we obtain the absolute values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 listed in table i. for the @xmath6 case , only the @xmath105 [ formerly called @xmath106@xcite , ] has been included in the pdg , so we estimate the relevant parameters with the help of a potential model .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath6 states and their radiative decay into the lower @xmath68-wave states have been calculated by numerous groups ( for reviews see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . by using the screened potential ,",
    "the updated results of the charmonium spectrum and the e1 transition rates are given in ref.@xcite . in this work , besides setting @xmath107 , @xmath108 is assigned to the @xmath109 state and @xmath110 is predicted . from the nonrelativistic results of @xmath111 presented in table iv of ref.@xcite",
    ", we obtain the absolute values of the corresponding coupling constants and give them in table i. because the mass differences between the @xmath6 states are much smaller than the mass gap between the @xmath6 and @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) states , in practice we use the center of gravity mass @xmath114 and the center of gravity coupling constant @xmath115 rather than calculating the contribution of the individual @xmath6 states .",
    ".the numerical values of the coupling constants @xmath116 are shown . for the @xmath117 case ,",
    "the results are obtained by fitting the experimental data , and for @xmath118 , the results are determined by comparing with the potential model predictions @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "now , we proceed to calculate the decay rate of the process @xmath120 via intermediate states @xmath2 .",
    "such @xmath121 process can be described by the following dimensionless variables : @xmath122 in terms of @xmath123 , the three - body phase space @xmath124 can be written as @xmath125 for each intermediate @xmath2 , there are two feynman diagrams , which are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the corresponding feynman amplitude is denoted by @xmath126 .",
    "putting the contributions of the three @xmath6 states together , the total feynman amplitude is then divided into four parts : @xmath127 each of @xmath128 on the right - hand side of the above equation can be obtained from the lagrangian in eq.(6 ) upon making the same replacements as discussed after ( [ vertex ] ) .",

    "we approximate them by introducing a constant decay width , which , parametrically , is @xmath129 .",

    "we have computed @xmath150 analytically , but the outcome is too lengthy to be presented here . after doing the phase space integrals numerically , we obtain that @xmath151 the numerical results yield that on the total decay width level the effects of the interference among the @xmath29 states as well as the effect of the @xmath6 states are so small that they can be neglected .",
    "we have also calculated the photon spectrum @xmath152 , and display the figures for each part separately in  [ fig : chic1p ] and  [ fig : chic2p ] , respectively .    since we have chosen different @xmath153 for the initial and final states in eq.([amplitude ] ) , we may also have a nontrivial @xmath7 polarization , which should be zero in the single @xmath153 case .",
    "similar to the production case @xcite , here , we define the polarization parameter @xmath154 as @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the decay widths for @xmath7 in the transverse and longitudinal polarization states , respectively .",
    "we calculate @xmath154 in the rest frame of @xmath18 and get @xmath158 .",
    "this is slightly different from zero , and we interpret it as a purely kinematic effect .",
    "we find that @xmath154 is mainly determined by the resonance contribution , being the influence of the interference and the @xmath6 terms tiny .",
    "the experimental measurement of the @xmath0 decay can be implemented in the off - mass shell region of @xmath25 , i.e. , the experimentally sensitive region in daltiz plot @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the invariant mass of the two photons and @xmath161 is the invariant mass of @xmath7 and the higher energy photon .",
    "these cut can mostly exclude the contribution from the highly yielded @xmath29 states . from the photon spectrum in the cut region indicated in  [ fig : chic_cut ] , the different contributions to the decay width ( [ decay ] ) read @xmath162 we have also computed the branching ratio , photon spectrum , and the polarization parameter in the cut region .",
    "the result of the branching ratio is @xmath163 the result in eqs.([cut1],[cut2 ] ) shows that , contrary to the case of the total decay width ( [ total ] ) , in the cut region the effect of interference among @xmath5 states as well as the contribution from the @xmath6 states can not be ignored . it is more than @xmath164 of the sum of the separated contributions of the @xmath29 states .",

    ". finally , the different contributions to the photon spectrum in the cut region are shown  [ fig : chic_cut ] .    as mentioned before",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath77 is related to the spatial matrix element @xmath171 in potential models .",
    "at least three different potential models , including the cornell potential @xcite and the screened potential @xcite , give the phase angle @xmath172 to be @xmath173 @xcite . hence , the @xmath168 option in our calculation appears to be favored .",
    "we have estimated the discrete contribution to the @xmath174 due to electric dipole transitions in the whole phase space and , in particular , in the cut region used at besiii .",
    "higher multipole electric transitions and the magnetic ones are suppressed by at least @xmath175 in the amplitude .",
    "this is also the case for contributions arising from two - photon vertices .",
    "the largest uncertainty in our calculation comes from the fact that we neglect the contribution of @xmath75 states for @xmath176 .",
    "this contribution is not parametrically suppressed by powers of @xmath47 , although we expect it to be small for the following two reasons : ( i ) the propagator of the @xmath75 state is increasingly off - shell when @xmath42 increases , and ( ii ) the coupling constants @xmath177 and @xmath178 are proportional to the overlap of the radial wave functions of the corresponding states , which decreases with @xmath42 .",
    "apart from this truncation , the estimate is reliable at leading order in @xmath92 .",
    "in fact , the modifications we have made in ( [ amplitude ] ) , which introduce terms of higher order in @xmath47 , take into account relativistic effects in the kinematics , and hence help in providing a better estimate .    from the point of view of potential models ,",
    "the leading corrections to the @xmath179 transition processes , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , mainly arise from the three following sources : ( i ) relativistic modification of the nonrelativistic wave functions , ( ii ) finite size effects , and ( iii ) contribution of high @xmath92 order electromagnetic operators @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the effective lagrangian , eq.([amplitude ] ) , to describe the @xmath179 transition process . for the @xmath5 case , we determine the values of the corresponding coupling constants from the experimental data .",
    "thus , the effects of ( i ) , which are dominant , are taken into account in our results , as far as the vertices involving the @xmath5 states is concerned .",
    "therefore , our results for the two - photon decay width in the off - shell region are more accurate than a potential model calculation for the one - photon @xmath179 transition process .",
    "both the corrections due to ( ii ) and to ( iii ) could be taken into account by including higher dimensional operators in the vertices ( [ vertex ] ) .",
    "as mentioned before these operators are suppressed by at least order @xmath92 .",
    "let us next discuss how our results compare with the usual inputs in the monte - carlo ( mc ) codes that are used to analyze the experimental data . in the experimental treatment of the four contributions in eq.([decay ] ) in the peaking region , usually only the first one , @xmath140 , is taken into account , and is often modeled using the nonrelativistic breit - wigner line shape of @xmath25 and @xmath7 .",
    "the other three components are negligible and generally omitted .",
    "but in the off - shell region , as argued above , the other three components will be sizable and have to be considered in the data treatment .",
    "furthermore , in the off - shell cut region ( [ eq : cut ] ) , even this naive nonrelativistic breit - wigner line shape description of the individual @xmath25 states contribution needs improvement .",
    "the reason is that a ( single ) nonrelativistic breit - wigner is only a good approximation to the line shape of @xmath182 in the resonance peaking region , as shown in  [ fig : res_a ] . in the cut region equation ( [ eq : cut ] ) , which lies between the @xmath183 and @xmath184 resonance peaks ,",
    "there is no guarantee that the nonrelativistic breit - wigners will provide a correct description of data .",
    "let us next point out the main ingredients it misses . in the @xmath179 transition process",
    ", the decay rate is proportional to the factor @xmath185 as shown in eq.([e1 ] ) .",
    "we may then improve on the nonrelativistic breit - wigner approximation by just introducing the correct photon energy dependence in each vertex i.e. the full @xmath186 scale factor from the two @xmath179 transitions .",
    "note that if one only includes the @xmath185 correction due to the first @xmath179 transition , @xmath187 in the cut region will be overestimated , because the energies of the two photons are negatively correlated .    in  [ fig : mc_sim ]",
    ", the mc simulation results of the line shapes in the cut region are shown , which are implemented in two ways .",
    "one is done by including the @xmath188 correction from a double @xmath179 transition , and the other one is not .",
    "the difference between these two mc simulation results can be understood as follows : the @xmath179 transition enhances the right tail of photon energy peak and depresses the left tail of the nonrelativistic breit - wigner . as a whole , the effect of the correlated emitted photons in the double @xmath179 transition increases the @xmath25 contribution in the cut region . for comparison , we also plot the effective lagrangian result of the sum of the three individual @xmath25 states contribution in  [ fig : mc_sim ] .",
    "it is clear that neither of the simulation results agree with that of the effective lagrangian calculation , although they are qualitatively similar . from the amplitude in eq.([amplitude ] ) , it can be verified that the @xmath186 factor and the nonrelativistic breit - wigner is only the leading - order nonrelativistic approximation of the effective lagrangian calculation in the off - shell region .",
    "hence , even for a delicate description of the individual contribution in the off - shell region , including the double @xmath179 transition correction in the naive nonrelativistic breit - wigner only may not be enough .    in summary",
    ", we have estimated the discrete contribution to the @xmath189 due to electric dipole transitions in the whole phase space , and in particular in the cut region in the experimental measurement .",
    "we find that for the full decay width the interference contribution and the contributions of higher excited states can be safely neglected .",
    "however , in the regions of the phase space off the resonance peaks , their contributions are considerable and important for a delicate experimental measurement .",

    "<S> the decay mode @xmath0 is proposed in order to experimentally identify the effects of the coupling of charmonium states to the continuum @xmath1 states . to have a better understanding of such a two - photon decay process , in this work </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves to investigate the contribution of the discrete part , in which the photons are mainly produced via the intermediate states @xmath2 . besides calculating the resonance contributions of @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we also take into account the contributions of the higher excited states @xmath4 and the interference effect among the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the contribution of the @xmath6 states and the interference terms to the total decay width is very tiny . </S>",
    "<S> however , for specific regions of the dalitz plot , off the resonance peaks , we find that these contributions are sizable and should also be accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide the photon spectrum and study the polarization of @xmath7 . </S>"
