    "depending on the nature of the quantum system studied , the physical consequences of the non - trivial topology of the eigenvector bundle are different .",
    "a number of physical examples have been studied in several areas of physics . in molecular systems ,",
    "the electronic structure depends on the semi - classical nuclear coordinates ( within the born - oppenheimer approximation ) which define the parameter space .",
    "their energy manifolds can have conical intersections at isolated values of the nuclear coordinates  @xcite : these so - called `` diabolical points '' are directly responsible for the change of multiplicity of rotation - vibrations levels as a function of nuclear coordinates . in molecular magnets ,",
    "the magnetic energy levels depend on the direction and magnitude of the applied magnetic field ( the parameter space ) with respect to the molecular axes .",
    "for some molecules , isolated degeneracies have also been found for specific direction and values of the magnetic field  @xcite . at these points ,",
    "quantum tunnelling is quenched as a result of interferences caused by the wavefunction phase changes around the `` defect '' .",
    "indeed , this phase change takes a particular value of @xmath15 for physically relevant paths encircling the degeneracy , leading to the destructive interferences observed .    in the few examples above",
    ", degeneracies occur at isolated conical intersections between two energy bands in a three - dimensional parameter space .",
    "these diabolical points are singularities of the quantum phase field over the parameter space and responsible for the `` exotic topologies '' . closed paths , through berry s phase , are sensitive probes of the topology . closed surfaces in a three - dimensional parameter space are also sensitive to the presence of conical points through a topological invariant called the chern index @xmath16 , which is an integer number .",
    "some of the best known phenomena in condensed matter physics are well - understood in terms of chern indices , such as integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )  @xcite , thouless pumping ( tp )  @xcite or ac josephson effect ( acje )  @xcite .",
    "physical quantities which can be expressed in term of chern indices are subject to _",
    "this is why they are used in metrology .",
    "for instance , the iqhe gives a conversion from voltage unit ( volt ) to current unit ( ampre ) through the resistance quantum @xmath17 : @xmath18 ; in the same way , the ac josephson effect gives a conversion from voltage to frequency ( in hertz ) through the magnetic flux quantum @xmath19 : @xmath20 .",
    "such physics can be encountered in the simplest superconducting circuit depending on three _ tunable _ parameters : the cooper pair pump ( cpp ) , where degeneracies occur at isolated points in the parameter space . here",
    ", the parameter space is constructed from two gate voltages @xmath21 and a quenched quantum phase @xmath22 .",
    "however , an essential difference subsists between the examples given above and our problem . in the case of iqhe , tp or acje",
    ", the relevant physical quantity measured is directly proportional to the chern index of the surface brought into play ( the magnetic brillouin zone for the iqhe ) . in a cpp",
    ", one can only make ( adiabatic ) paths in the parameter space by modifying the parameters in order to tune the current delivered by the cpp .",
    "thus , berry s phase seems to be , _ a priori _ , the relevant topological quantity characterizing the paths . this will be shown to always be the case , by relating the charge transferred by the cpp through a path is always expressible in term of a berry s phase , even for open paths .",
    "nevertheless , chern indices can also specify the value of the current for specific paths covering densely a closed surface enclosing a diabolical point .",
    "the degree of quantization of the current delivered by this method improves exponentially with the degree of the surface coverage .",
    "this form of quantization is referred to as `` topological quantization by controlled paths '' ( tqcp ) .",
    "the current will be shown to be equal to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a characteristic frequency of the adiabatic cycles of pumping .",
    "for metrology , the cooper pair pumping through tqcp gives a conversion between current and frequency : it is an effect which could be used to close the metrological triangle between the units of voltage @xmath25 , current @xmath26 and frequency @xmath24 .    in this paper , we emphasize what is new and specific to quantum circuits , and the example of the cooper pair pump is an excellent case study for the concept of tqcp around which much of the paper is built . in sec .",

    "the simplest one consists in applying microwave pulses to the cpp gates at the frequency splitting between the @xmath429 states .",
    "the point @xmath11 may be chosen at one of the magical points along the saddle lines of the hexagons where the system is to first order insensitive to gate charge and phase fluctuations @xcite .",
    "but there are simpler circuits where such operations have been demonstrated and the cpp is more interesting to implement quantum computation using adiabatic cycles .",
    "duan and coworkers@xcite have shown how geometric gates could be implemented on a degenerate two - levels system using resonant transitions between this @xmath27 doublet and an excited level @xmath432 provided it is also coupled to an auxiliary level @xmath433 . in the cpp , @xmath433 could in principle be a higher lying charge state , but this solution is not as convenient as for atomic systems . we prefer to do without the @xmath433 state . in this case",
    ", the dynamical contribution associated to the rabi frequency can not be eliminated altogether . as long as this phase shift can be tuned to a multiple of @xmath15 , a geometric gate can be implemented .",
    "the cpp is biased at degeneracy ( @xmath321 ) , and microwave voltages tuned at the @xmath434 frequency splitting are applied to _ both _ gates .",
    "when going to a frame rotating at the same frequency , the coupling to the @xmath432 state becomes time independent @xmath435 where @xmath436 is the main rabi frequency , and the angle @xmath437 controls the relative strength of the couplings of the @xmath103 and @xmath105 to the @xmath432 state , while @xmath438 is their relative phase .",
    "these three quantities can be adjusted by tuning the amplitude and the phase of the microwave voltages applied to the cpp gates . here , @xmath138 phase cycles in @xmath438 are sufficient to generate the gate operations . in the rotating frame , one of the sate is stationary , while the other two oscillate at @xmath439 .",
    "adjusting the period of operation @xmath177 to eliminate the dynamical phase shift ( @xmath440 ) , a @xmath138-cycle in @xmath438 generates the operation    @xmath441    which covers all the one - qubit gate operation .",
    "two - qubit geometrical gates can also be considered by coupling two cooper pair pumps together .",
    "one way this may be achieved is to close the two pumps on the same inductance @xmath267 : the current pumped in both device add up in @xmath267 , shifting the phase @xmath22 by an amount of order @xmath442 where @xmath443 is the current through the @xmath238-th cpp .    in practice , adiabatic computing faces a number of difficulties . even for one - qubit operations three or more states",
    "have to be degenerate . but any low frequency flux or charge noise moves the area in parameter space where the degeneracy occurs and the shifts in parameters rotates the eigenvectors rapidly .",
    "while this has little impact for topological quantization , this deteriorates the performance of geometrical gates . the accuracy with which parameters are to be controlled is also considerably higher than for usual quantum gates .",
    "these are some of the reason why geometrical gates have not yet been demonstrated .",
    "most limitations for adiabatic computing are irrelevant to topological quantization which is robust against most perturbations . for a cpp , charge or phase noise is considered slow when most of its spectrum is below the frequency of operation of the pump @xmath444 ( 100 mhz is a realistic number ) .",
    "such noise source add a random component to the controlled voltage or the magnetic flux and the path in @xmath7 no longer generates a cylinder , but a more irregular surface .",
    "as far as the geometrical charge is concerned , this has almost no effect , as long as the resulting surface still encloses the topological point @xmath321 .",
    "similarly if the junction capacitances or josephson couplings fluctuate in time , the position of the point @xmath321 fluctuates in @xmath7 , and this has little effect as long as this shift is small compared to the cylinder s radius . in presence of low frequency noise ,",
    "dynamical contributions no longer cancel exactly . on the other hand ,",
    "the errors are random and can be averaged using long integration times .    if charge or phase noise has frequency components at the splitting between the two lowest states @xmath429 or if landau zener transition occur at one of the three saddle point crossings ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : charge - quantization ] for a discussion ) , the system will spend a fraction of the time in the first excited state . since the chern index of the @xmath103 state is opposite to the ground state",
    ", this will introduce an error in the pumped charge proportional to the relative time spent in the excited state .",
    "this is why high frequency noise must be thoroughly filtered and the pumped speed adjusted to quench landau - zener transitions .",
    "this study of quantization by _ controlled path _ , although conducted around cpp circuits , is quite general .",
    "the necessary criteria which have been stated in the introduction , are now discussed in more detail    1",
    ".   the adiabatic condition can only be satisfied for discrete spectra .",
    "furthermore , adiabaticity only holds well for a quantum state if its energy splittings with other levels are sufficient .",
    "the presence of isolated degeneracies between two lowest states states is required . for a complex hamiltonian ,",
    "this is possible only if it depends on three continuous parameters . in quantum circuits ,",
    "tunable parameters are typically gate voltages and magnetic fluxes . for cooper",
    "pair pumps , the parameters are two gates charges and a phase ( cpp ) or two phases and a charge ( cf . the sluice pump @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters are used to generate _ controlled paths _ in the three - dimensional parameter space @xmath7 .",
    "additional parameters are useful for adiabatic computations ( section v ) .",
    "there are two recipes to locate the degeneracies .",
    "the first one hinges on their topological signature on the berry s phase ( @xmath15 ) . as argued by a.j .",
    "stone @xcite , one can divide the parameter space @xmath7 in small volumes around which berry s phase is computed .",
    "if a single degeneracy exists inside the loop , berry s phase picks it up .",
    "another method is to detect the vorticity of the eigenvector bundle in the vicinity of a degeneracy ( see sections [ sec : fiber - bundle ] and [ sec : cpp ] ) : in this case the `` mirror symmetry '' and `` t - symmetry '' are broken for the ground state , i.e. they flip the eigenvector bundles intersecting at the degeneracy ( kramers symmetry ) .",
    "3 .   only observable proportional",
    "to the partial derivative of the hamiltonian @xmath71 with respect to one of the tunable parameters @xmath154 ( @xmath22 for the cpp ) can be quantized using tqcp . in this case , its averaged expectation value over a closed surface @xmath65 around a degeneracy is proportional to the chern index of this surface . when the variable is periodic , we may choose this surface with the topology of a torus .",
    "a path sweeping this surface or covering it densely is the _ controlled path _ expressing the quantization .",
    "although topological quantization is quite robust , transitions to the first excited state ( induced by fluctuations or landau - zener processes ) are problematic because the chern indices of the two lowest levels have opposite sign .",
    "the above criteria only concern geometrical contributions .",
    "but the dynamical evolution of the observable may also contribute .",
    "an accurate quantization is possible if they can be eliminated through symmetries or other schemes .",
    "this depends to some extend of the physical problem on hand . for quantum circuits , the following condition is sufficient to average them out :      the value of the topological quantization is its strong robustness to adiabatic parameters fluctuations , the chern index of the surface enclosing the degeneracy being the quantum number of the quantity of interest . for a cooper pump ,",
    "the magnitude of the current generated @xmath445 is of order 30 pa for realistic values of the parameters .",
    "one of the potential application for a cooper pair pump is as an accurate current source@xcite to close the metrology - triangle @xcite , relating frequency to voltage through the josephson effect , voltage to current through the quantum hall effect and frequency to current through topological pumping .",
    "it is interesting to note that all these effects are the result of topological quantization @xcite . in order to be useful in this context , where the pumped current feeds a hall bar , a higher current is needed ( 100 na or higher@xcite ) .",
    "large gain amplification schemes are being designed to fulfill this condition .",
    "another method for a current - frequency conversion relies on bloch oscillation@xcite .",
    "this method has been recently demonstrated by the quantronium group @xcite .",
    "this method , also based on a topological quantization ( thouless pumping@xcite ) , also appears to be quite promising .    to conclude ,",
    "we have stressed the importance of topological quantization in superconducting circuits .",
    "we showed how closed paths can be chosen in parameter space to generate a surface on which the `` charge '' @xmath28 is quantized by a chern index .",
    "we have also shown how the charge transferred on any path could be obtained , giving also a local picture which can not be derived from the usual global geometrical picture .",
    "finally , the technique developed around superconducting circuits is quite general and can be applied to any problems in which the criteria listed in the introduction and conclusion are satisfied",
