    "how disks form is a longstanding , unsolved problem in star formation ( bodenheimer1995 ) .",
    "observationally , it has been difficult to determine when and how the disks first come into existence during the star formation process .",
    "although disks are routinely observed around evolved class ii young stellar objects ( see williamscieza2011 for a review ) and increasingly around younger class i sources ( e.g. , brinch+2007 ; jorgensen+2009 ; lee2011 ; takakuwa+2012 ; harsono+2014 ; lindberg+2014 ) , observations of the youngest disks have been hampered by the emission from their massive envelope .",
    "nevertheless , rotationally supported disks are beginning to be detected around deeply embedded , class 0 protostars ( tobin+2012 ; murillo+2013 ; n. ohashi , priv .",
    "this impressive observational progress is expected to accelerate in the near future , as alma becomes fully operational .",
    "theoretically , disk formation is complicated by magnetic fields , which are observed in dense , star - forming , cores of molecular clouds ( see crutcher2012 for a review ) . in the simplest case of a non - turbulent core with the magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis",
    ", both analytic considerations and numerical simulations have shown that the formation of a rotationally supported disk ( rsd hereafter ) is suppressed , in the ideal mhd limit , by a realistic magnetic field ( corresponding to a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio of @xmath0 a few ; trolandcrutcher2008 ) during the protostellar mass accretion phase through magnetic braking ( allen+2003 ; galli+2006 ; pricebate2007 ; mellonli2008 ; hennebellefromang2008 ; dappbasu2010 ; seifried+2011 ; santos - lima+2012 ) .",
    "this suppression of rsds is termed the `` magnetic braking catastrophe . ''",
    "there are a number of mechanisms proposed in the literature to overcome the catastrophic braking , including ( 1 ) non - ideal mhd effects ( ambipolar diffusion , the hall effect and ohmic dissipation ) , ( 2 ) misalignment between the magnetic and rotation axes , and ( 3 ) turbulence ( see li+2014 for a critical review of the proposed mechanisms ) .",
    "ambipolar diffusion does not appear to weaken the braking enough to enable large - scale rsd formation under realistic conditions ( krasnopolskykonigl2002 ; mellonli2009 ; duffinpudritz2009 ; li+2011 ) .",
    "ohmic dissipation can produce small , au - scale , rsds in the early protostellar accretion phase ( machida+2011 ; dappbasu2010 ; dapp+2012 ; tomida+2013 ) .",
    "how such disks grow in time remain to be fully quantified .",
    "larger , @xmath1-scale rsds can be produced if the resistivity or the hall coefficient of the dense core is much larger than the classical ( microscopic ) value ( krasnopolsky+2010 ; krasnopolsky+2011 ; santos - lima+2012 ; braidingwardle2012a ; braidingwardle2012b ) .",
    "large rsds can also form if the magnetic field is misaligned with the rotation axis by a large angle ( see hull+2013 for observational evidence for misalignment but davidson+2011 and chapman+2013 for evidence to the contrary ) , provided that the dense core is not too strongly magnetized ( joos+2012 ; li+2013 ; krumholz+2013 ) .",
    "the effects of turbulence on magnetized disk formation were first explored by @xcite , who demonstrated that a strong enough turbulence can enable the formation of a @xmath1-scale rsd .",
    "the beneficial effects of turbulence on disk formation were confirmed numerically by a number of authors , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , why the turbulence is conducive to disk formation remains hotly debated .",
    "@xcite attributed the disk formation to the turbulence induced or enhanced magnetic reconnection ( lazarianvishniac1999 ; kowal+2009 ) , which reduces the strength of the magnetic field in the inner , disk - forming , part of the accretion flow .",
    "@xcite proposed instead that the turbulence - induced tangling of field lines and strong local shear are mainly responsible for the disk formation : the disordered magnetic field weakens the braking and the shear enhances rotation .",
    "@xcite found that the turbulence produced an effective magnetic diffusivity that enabled the magnetic flux to diffuse outward , broadly consistent with the picture envisioned in @xcite .",
    "it also generated a substantial misalignment between the rotation axis and magnetic field direction ( an effect also seen in seifried+2012 and myers+2013 ) , which is known to promote disk formation .",
    "the lack of consensus on why turbulence helps disk formation in magnetized cloud cores motivated us to examine this important issue more closely .",
    "we carry out numerical experiments of disk formation in magnetized dense cores with different levels of initial turbulence .",
    "we find that the magnetic flux threading the circumstellar , disk - forming region on the equatorial plane is indeed reduced by turbulence .",
    "we show that this reduction can be explained by a combination of magnetic decoupling - triggered reconnection of severely pinched field lines close to the central object and a simple geometry effect  warping of the well - known magnetic pseudodisk ( gallishu1993 ) out of the disk - forming , equatorial plane by turbulence  without having to rely on turbulence - induced magnetic reconnection .",
    "we find that the turbulence - induced pseudodisk warping also reduces the rates of angular momentum removal by both magnetic torque and outflow , which is conducive to disk formation .",
    "we describe the problem setup in   [ setup ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented and analyzed in   [ results ] .",
    "we compare our results to previous work and discuss their implications in   [ discussion ] and conclude with a summary in   [ conclusion ] .",
    "we will adopt the basic setup of @xcite  ( @xcite ; see also krasnopolsky+2010 ) , where a rotating , magnetized , turbulent but non - self - gravitating dense core accretes onto a central object of fixed mass .",
    "this setup is idealized , but has an important advantage for our purpose of understanding why turbulence helps disk formation in a magnetized core .",
    "it enables us to repeat the type of calculations by @xcite , but at a better spatial resolution in the disk - forming region ( and a lower numerical diffusivity for the magnetic field ) .",
    "the higher resolution is achieved using the zeustw code ( krasnopolsky+2010 ) , which can follow the core collapse and disk formation on a non - uniform grid in a spherical polar coordinate system .",
    "this coordinate system is more natural than the cartesian coordinate system for disk formation simulations , especially for implementing clean boundary conditions near the accreting protostar for both the matter and magnetic field ( see   2.2 of mellonli2008 and discussion below ) .",
    "our goal is to develop a qualitative understanding based on simple numerical experiments .",
    "quantitative results may be modified when self - gravity is included ( see discussion in   [ caveat ] ) .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we start our simulations from a uniform , spherical core of @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 in a spherical coordinate system @xmath4 .",
    "the initial density @xmath5 corresponds to a molecular hydrogen number density of @xmath6 .",
    "we adopt an isothermal equation of state with a sound speed @xmath7 below a critical density @xmath8 , and a polytropic equation of state @xmath9 above it .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the following prescription for the initial rotation speed : @xmath10 which implies that the equatorial plane is the plane of disk formation .",
    "we adopt @xmath11 and @xmath12 to ensure that a large , well resolved , rotationally supported disk is formed at a relatively early time in the absence of any magnetic braking ( see fig .  1 of krasnopolsky+2010 and fig .",
    "[ disk ] below ) .",
    "the goal of our numerical experiments is to determine whether such a disk is suppressed by a realistic level of magnetic field in the absence of turbulence and , if yes , whether turbulence can weaken the magnetic braking enough to allow the disk to reappear .",
    "since the focus of our investigation is on the effects of turbulence , we will consider only one value , @xmath13 , for the strength of the magnetic field , which is assumed to be uniform initially and aligned with the rotation axis ( i.e. , with a misalignment angle @xmath14 ; a misaligned case of @xmath15 will be discussed in   [ discussion ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath16 , in units of the critical value @xmath17 , for the core as a whole , which is not far from the median value of @xmath18 inferred by @xcite for a sample of nearby dense cores .",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio for the central flux tube @xmath19 is higher than the global value @xmath20 by @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 .",
    "our chosen magnetic field is therefore not unusually strong ; if anything , it may be on the weak side .",
    "we add a turbulent velocity field to the magnetized core at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "although the existence of `` turbulence '' on the @xmath23 core scale has been known for a long time through `` non - thermal '' linewidth ( e.g. , myers1995 ) , its detailed properties , such as energy spectra , remain poorly constrained observationally . for simplicity ,",
    "we generate the initial turbulent velocity field as a superposition of 1000 sinusoidal waves of wavelengths logarithmically spaced between a minimum wavelength @xmath24 and a maximum @xmath25 .",
    "the initial velocity vector of each sinusoidal wave has an amplitude that is proportional to @xmath26 , a random phase , and a random direction that is perpendicular to an equally random wave propagation vector .",
    "we have experimented with different number of waves and random seeds , and found qualitatively similar results .",
    "the main parameter that we decide to vary is the level of turbulence , which is characterized by the rms mach number @xmath27 . in   [ results ] , we will discuss in some depth six models that have the same turbulent velocity field except for the overall normalization , which is given respectively by @xmath28 ( non - turbulent , model a of table 1 ) , @xmath29 ( model b ) , @xmath30 ( model c ) , @xmath31 ( model d ) , @xmath32 ( model e ) , and @xmath33 ( model f ) .",
    "in addition , we will consider the disk formed in a non - magnetic , non - turbulent core ( model h ) and a case with the magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis ( @xmath15 , model p ) , for comparison with the disks formed in the aligned ( @xmath14 ) case that are enabled by turbulence ( see   [ discussion ] ) .",

    "the boundary conditions in the azimuthal direction are periodic . in the radial direction ,",
    "we impose the standard outflow boundary conditions for both the hydrodynamic quantities and magnetic field , at both the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "the boundary conditions are enforced using ghost zones . for the density and three components of the velocity",
    ", we simply copy their values in the active zone closest to the boundary into the ghost zones , except when the radial component of the velocity is pointing into the computation domain ( i.e. , @xmath57 near the inner boundary or @xmath58 near the outer boundary ) ; in such cases , the radial velocity is set to zero in the ghost zones to prevent mass flowing into the computation domain from outside , where there is no self - consistently determined flow information .",
    "these boundary conditions allow matter and angular momentum to leave the outer radial boundary , as needed for the magnetic - braking driven outflow , and to accrete through the inner radial boundary .",
    "the boundary conditions on the magnetic field are enforced through the electromotive force ( emf ) , which is used to evolve the field everywhere , including the ghost zones , using the method of constrained transport ( ct ) .",
    "the three components of the emf are copied from the active zone closest to the boundary into the ghost zones . in effect",
    ", we are assuming continuity from the computation domain into the ghost zones for both the hydrodynamic quantities and magnetic field , which minimizes the risks of artificial wave reflection at the boundary .",
    "the use of ct ensures that the divergence - free condition @xmath59 is preserved to machine accuracy in both the active computation domain and the ghost zones . in particular ,",
    "the magnetic field lines dragged by the accretion flow across the inner boundary stay on the boundary , forming essentially a split magnetic monopole , as expected in ideal mhd ( galli+2006 ) , until ( numerical ) reconnection is triggered by severe pinching of the oppositely directed field lines ( see mellonli2008 and discussion below ) .",

    "since our inner boundary is covered by nearly 10,000 cells , it can resolve the angular distributions of the magnetic field and flow quantities better than the `` sink accretion region '' of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that there was formally no `` sink accretion region '' in @xcite .",
    "they adopted a stiffened equation of state above a mass density of @xmath64 , which produced an artificially thermally supported object of order @xmath52 in size ( comparable to that of our inner boundary ) , which served as an effective `` inner boundary '' for their simulations .",
    "note that their `` inner boundary '' is quite different from the `` sink accretion region '' of @xcite and @xcite , and both treatments are very different from ours . how these different treatments affect",

    "although this is not strictly valid , we expect its effect to be limited to a small region near the axis . as in @xcite and @xcite ,",

    "although it is desirable to carry out the simulations in ideal mhd , so that they can be compared more directly with other works , especially @xcite , we found the ideal mhd simulations difficult to perform in practice , because they tend to produce numerical `` hot zones '' where the courant conditions demand such a small timestep that they force the calculation to stop early , a tendency we noted in our previous 2d ( mellonli2008 ) and 3d simulations ( krasnopolsky+2012 and li+2013 ) . to lengthen the simulation",
    ", we include a small , spatially uniform resistivity @xmath66 .",
    "we have verified that , in model f with @xmath67 ( which turns out to be one of the most interesting cases and will be discussed in greatest detail ) , this resistivity changes the flow structure little compared to either the ideal mhd limit or a model where the resistivity is reduced by a factor 10 , to @xmath68 , at early times ( before the non - resistive and low - resistivity runs stop ) .",
    "it is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the value needed to enable large - scale disk formation by itself ( krasnopolsky+2010 ) .",
    "there was no mention of the need for using explicit resistivity to lengthen simulation of magnetized disk formation by other groups .",
    "the exact reason for this difference is unclear , although we suspect that it is related to the relatively low magnetic diffusivity in our code from the use of ( 1 ) fixed non - uniform grid , which avoids the numerical diffusion associated with refinement and derefinement , and ( 2 ) method of characteristics in constrained transport , which makes the mhd algorithm more accurate ( stonenorman1992 ) .",
    "the results of the current simulations from different groups appear to depend strongly on the numerical code used in each study . in the future",
    ", it will be desirable to benchmark all mhd codes used for disk formation simulations against common test problems such as the collapse of a non - rotating , uniformly magnetized sphere of constant density , especially in the protostellar accretion phase , when the magnetic field is severely pinched and its structure is sensitive to the level of numerical diffusivity ( see related discussion in footnote [ 2d ] below ) .",
    "to illustrate the effects of turbulence on disk formation in magnetized dense cores , we carried out a set of six simulations with identical initial conditions except for the level of turbulence , which is characterized , respectively , by the rms turbulent mach number @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( see models a  f in table 1 ) .",
    "the simulations were run to a common final time @xmath69 or about @xmath70 years .",
    "[ turbe_6p ] shows the density distribution and velocity field on the equatorial plane at a representative time @xmath71 for all six cases .",
    "the difference in morphology is striking .    in the non - turbulent ( @xmath28 ) model ( model a )",
    ", there is no hint of any rotationally supported disk ( rsd ) , consistent with previous work .",
    "the circumstellar region is dominated by a highly magnetized , low - density expanding region ( the so - called `` decoupling enabled magnetic structure '' or dems that has been discussed extensively in zhao+2011 and krasnopolsky+2012 ; see fig .",
    "[ dems ] and   [ dems_discussion ] below ) .",
    "this behavior is not changed fundamentally by a modest amount of turbulence in the @xmath72 ( model b ) or @xmath30 ( model c ) cases , where the rsd remains suppressed and dems remains dynamically important . here",
    ", the turbulence does change the appearance of the density distribution on the equatorial plane drastically .",
    "it produces well - ordered dense spirals that are absent in the non - turbulent case .",
    "the spirals mark the locations where a thin , warped , pseudodisk ( shown in figs .",
    "[ densphere ] and [ 3dview ] below ) intercepts the equatorial plane .",
    "the apparent spirals persist as the level of turbulence increases . at the time shown in fig .",
    "[ turbe_6p ] , they appear to merge into a disk - like structure in model d ( @xmath73 ) , although the central region of the structure is still filled with low - density `` holes . ''",
    "this porous disk is highly dynamic .",
    "it forms around @xmath74 , and becomes disrupted by @xmath75 ( a movie illustrating the transient nature of the disk is available online as auxiliary material ) .",
    "the situation is similar in the slightly stronger turbulence case of @xmath76 ( model e ) , where a transient disk is also formed .",
    "compared to the @xmath73 case , the disk in the @xmath76 case forms earlier ( @xmath77 ) , and lasts longer ( until @xmath78 ) .",
    "as the level of turbulence increases to @xmath67 ( model f ) , a well - defined disk forms earlier still ( @xmath79 ) , grows steadily with time , and persists to the end of the simulation . as seen from fig .",
    "[ infallrot ] , the disk is rotationally supported , with an average rotation speed close to the keplerian speed and a much smaller infall speed inside a radius of @xmath80 at the time shown in fig .",
    "[ turbe_6p ] ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the non - turbulent case ( model a ) where the rotation on the same @xmath81 scale is highly sub - keplerian and is dominated by infall .",
    "the rotationally supported disk in model f turns out to be rather thick and significantly magnetized .",
    "its properties will be discussed in more detail in   [ discussion ] .",
    "here we focus on the unmistakable trend that a stronger turbulence leads to the formation of a more robust disk .",
    "the question is : why is the disk formation suppressed in the non - turbulent or weakly turbulent cases but enabled by a stronger turbulence ?",
    "one possibility is that a stronger turbulence may increase the initial angular momentum by a larger amount , making it easier to form a rsd .",
    "however , even in the most turbulent case of model f , the increase is modest , by @xmath82 or less over most of the mass ( and volume ; see fig .",
    "[ turbangmom ] ) .",
    "it is unlikely that such a modest change alone can explain the drastically different outcomes for our non - turbulent and sonic turbulence cases .",
    "disk suppression in ideal mhd is conceptually tied to another fundamental problem in star formation  the so - called `` magnetic flux problem . ''",
    "if the field lines in a dense core magnetized to the observed level are dragged by collapse into the central stellar object , they would produce a split magnetic monopole near the center that is strong enough to remove essentially all of the angular momentum of the accreted material and prevent the formation of a rotationally supported circumstellar disk ( galli+2006 ) .",
    "however , it is well known that if the flux freezing holds strictly during the core collapse , the stellar field strength would be orders of magnitude above the observed values ( shu+1987 ) .",
    "this magnetic flux problem must be resolved one way or another , and its resolution is a prerequisite for disk formation .",
    "the stellar magnetic flux problem can be resolved in principle through non - ideal mhd effects ( e.g. , limckee1996 ; contopoulos+1998 ; kunzmouschovias2010 ; machida+2011 ; dappbasu2010 ; dapp+2012 ; tomida+2013 ) , which decouple the field lines from the matter at high densities close to the central object . in ideal mhd simulations ,",
    "the decoupling can be mimicked by numerically induced magnetic flux redistribution . to demonstrate that flux redistribution has indeed occurred in our simulations , we plot in fig .",
    "[ diffusion ] the magnetic flux @xmath83 that leaves the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath47 : @xmath84 where the integration is over the part of the surface with magnetic field pointing outward , i.e. , @xmath85 ( we have verified that the amount of flux entering the sphere is exactly the same as that going out ) . near the inner boundary @xmath86 , this flux provides a measure of the strength of the central split magnetic monopole .",
    "its value on any sphere is to be compared with the magnetic flux expected to be dragged into the same sphere by matter under the condition of flux freezing , @xmath87 .",
    "the expected flux depends on the amount of mass that has already accumulated inside the sphere ( @xmath88 , including the mass that has passed through the inner boundary ) , and whether the mass is accumulated along or across the field lines ; mass accumulation along field lines would not lead to any flux increase . in the limit that all of the mass along the field lines that initially thread a sphere has accumulated inside the sphere ,",

    "this flux is a ( generous ) lower limit to @xmath87 at relatively small radii , where only a small fraction of the mass along any given field line has collapsed close to the central object at the relatively early times under consideration .",
    "it is derived by relating the magnetic flux @xmath93 enclosed within a cylinder of radius @xmath94 in the initially constant - density dense core with a uniform magnetic field to the mass enclosed by the same cylinder . an upper limit to @xmath87 is obtained by assuming that the mass accumulation is isotropic , which yields @xmath95^{2/3}. \\label{upper}\\ ] ] this is an upper limit because the core collapse proceeds somewhat faster along field lines than across .    from fig .",
    "[ diffusion ] , it is clear that the actual magnetic flux @xmath83 is below the minimum value @xmath96 expected from flux - freezing at small radii ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this is evidence for magnetic flux redistribution , which has reduced the flux near the inner boundary ( and hence the strength of the split magnetic monopole ) by at least a factor of 4 ( more likely an order of magnitude ) in the non - turbulent case ( model a , solid line in the figure ) .",
    "the flux redistribution is likely related to a similar behavior that @xcite observed in their 2d ( axisymmetric ) self - gravitating simulations .",
    "they found episodic reconnection of the oppositely directed field lines above and below the equatorial plane near the inner boundary ( see their fig .",
    "we have carried out several 2d ( axisymmetric ) non - self - gravitating simulations with different spatial resolutions and different values of resistivity @xmath98 ( including @xmath99 ) , and found episodic reconnection in all cases .",
    "movies of two examples are included as online auxiliary material , and their snapshots at a representative time @xmath71 ( or frame 80 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ 2dsnap ] .",
    "they have the same initial mass and magnetic field distributions as models a  f but with @xmath99 and without any initial rotation , and have inner radius @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . ) .",
    "this is perhaps not too surprising , since there is no explicit resistivity in these simulations , so the reconnection of the sharply pinched magnetic field must involve numerical diffusion .",
    "it can occur at different locations ( and with different intensities ) , depending on the inner radius and spatial resolution .",
    "such a dependence makes it difficult to obtain numerically converged solutions , at least ( perhaps especially ) in the 2d case in the ideal mhd limit .",
    "whether non - ideal mhd effects can alleviate this difficulty or not remains to be determined.[2d ] ]    in any case , the reconnected field lines in the 2d simulations are driven outward by magnetic tension force , leaving behind a strongly magnetized , low density region .",
    "this two - step flux redistribution  field line reconnection near the inner boundary followed by outward field advection  is likely operating in our 3d simulations as well .",
    "a difference is that , in 3d , mass accretion can continuously drag field lines across the inner boundary along some ( azimuthal ) directions , with the reconnected field lines escaping outward along other directions .",
    "this more continuous reconnection makes individual events less powerful , and thus harder to identify ( zhao+2011 ; krasnopolsky+2012 ) , especially in the presence of a turbulence . in the non - turbulent ( model a ) , and weakly turbulent ( model b and c ) cases , the redistributed magnetic flux remains trapped close to the central object , forming a strongly magnetized , low - density region  the dems  that is known to be a formidable obstacle to disk formation ( zhao+2011 ; krasnopolsky+2012 ; see fig .",
    "[ dems ] ) . in these cases ,",
    "the decoupling - triggered reconnection has greatly weakened the central split magnetic monopole , which lies at the heart of the magnetic braking catastrophe in ideal mhd ( galli+2006 ) .",
    "however , it created another , perhaps even more severe , problem  the dems  which has to be overcome in order for rotationally supported disks to form .      in order for rsds to form , both the central split magnetic monopole _ and _",
    "the dems must be weakened .",
    "[ diffusion ] shows that the amount of magnetic flux @xmath83 threading the inner boundary is about the same for the non - turbulent ( model a ) and sonic turbulence ( model f ) cases , indicating that the weakening of the split magnetic monopole is not controlled by turbulence .",
    "as discussed above , it is most likely caused by the decoupling - triggered reconnection observed in the 2d axisymmetric case .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath83 is somewhat lower in the turbulent case between @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( see the dashed line in fig .  [ diffusion ] ) .",
    "this could be due to additional , turbulence - enhanced , magnetic reconnection during the core collapse , as advocated by @xcite  ( @xcite , see also santos - lima+2013 and joos+2013 ) . alternatively , it could be related to how the field lines reconnected near the inner boundary escape to large distances , as discussed below in   [ origin ] . in any case , the difference in @xmath83 between these models with and without turbulence is relatively moderate .",
    "a more striking difference lies in the dems . fig .",

    "this pseudodisk is dynamically important because it is where the majority of the core mass accretion occurs .",

    "the presence of a moderate level of turbulence does not change the above picture fundamentally .",
    "for example , the @xmath72 turbulence in model b warps the nearly flat pseudodisk in the non - turbulent case only slightly , as seen in panel ( b ) of fig .",

    "this , we believe , is the reason why the pseudodisk is perturbed , rather than completely destroyed , by a subsonic or transonic turbulence . in   [ origin ] , we will present general arguments for the pseudodisk as a generic feature of magnetized core collapse .",
    "the warped pseudodisk plays the same fundamental role in the turbulent cases as the flat pseudodisk in the non - turbulent case : it is the main conduit for core mass accretion .",

    "[ bflux ] , turbulence tends to lower the magnetic flux threading the equatorial plane at small radii at late times . to understand this trend quantitatively",

    "the meaning of the second term @xmath147 is less obvious ; it is the rate of flux advection by vertical motions ( along the @xmath148-axis , perpendicular to the equatorial plane ) that can move radial field lines across the circle on the equatorial plane .",

    "both @xmath153 and @xmath152 need to have a relatively large value , which can be achieved when a pseudodisk with a highly pinched magnetic field ( i.e. , an appreciable @xmath152 ) is strongly perturbed vertically ( i.e. , an appreciable @xmath153 ) , by turbulence or some other means .    to illustrate how a strongly perturbed pseudodisk can slow down the magnetic flux accumulation inside a circle more pictorially , we plot in fig .",
    "[ warpb ] the density distribution and magnetic field ( unit ) vectors on a representative meridian plane for the @xmath67 case .",

    "the above - the - equatorial - plane loop ( on the right side ) delivers a substantial amount of matter through the upper hemisphere ( marked by the dashed line in the figure ) but little net magnetic flux ; the sharp kink of field lines across the loop allows most of the field lines dragged into the hemisphere by the accreting loop to return through the same hemisphere , without crossing or touching the circle on the equatorial plane ( marked by two red crosses on the figure ) ; a similar case can be made for the lower hemisphere .",
    "this is in contrast with the mass accretion through the unperturbed equatorial pseudodisk , which must be accompanied by a flux increase ( in the ideal mhd limit ) . since the net magnetic flux going through the upper ( or lower ) hemisphere is the same as that through the equatorial plane that bisects the sphere , the pseudodisk warping provides a natural explanation for the lower magnetic flux accumulated close to the central object on the equatorial plane ( and thus a weaker dems ) that we found for a stronger turbulence .      whether a rotationally supported disk can form or not depends on the amount of angular momentum that is initially available on the core scale and that is removed by magnetic torque and outflow as the rotating core material collapses toward the central object .",
    "we follow @xcite in evaluating the @xmath148-components of the dominant magnetic torque due to the magnetic tension force ( as opposed to the magnetic pressure gradient ) and the advective torque : @xmath155 and @xmath156 where @xmath94 is the cylindrical radius , and the integration is over the surface @xmath157 of a sphere of radius @xmath47 .",

    "it is clear that , as matter enters the equatorial pseudodisk , it drags the field lines into a highly pinched configuration ( note the reversal of the radial field above and below the pseudodisk ) .",

    "the peak rate of angular momentum removal by magnetic torque is substantially reduced ( by a factor of @xmath167 , see fig .",
    "[ torq ] ) .",
    "our interpretation is that the reduction is due to the distortion of the highly coherent magnetic barrier of the @xmath28 case by turbulence .",
    "[ warpb ] shows that the transition from the infall envelope to the pseudodisk is less coherent and more gradual in the @xmath67 case compared to the @xmath28 case ( fig .",
    "[ pseudo ] ) . as a result",
    ", the rotation is braked more gently as the matter enters the ( highly warped ) pseudodisk .",
    "the weaker braking at the outer part of the pseudodisk leaves the material inside the pseudodisk with more angular momentum , making it more likely to form a rotationally supported disk .",
    "another difference between the @xmath28 and @xmath33 case lies in the outflow . in the non - turbulent case ,",
    "the outflow is driven mostly by the equatorial ( rotating ) pseudodisk , which winds up the field lines , building up a magnetic pressure near the equatorial plane that is released by ( bipolar ) expansion away from the plane .",
    "on the scale of the pseudodisk ( @xmath168 ) that is crucial for disk formation , the outflow removes angular momentum at a rate that is a substantial fraction ( typically @xmath169 to @xmath170 ) of that by magnetic torque ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ torq ] for an example ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the @xmath67 case , where the angular momentum removal by outflow is much less efficient on the same scale ( see fig .",
    "[ torq ] ) .",
    "the lower efficiency is most likely caused by the severe warping of the pseudodisk , which weakens the ability of the rotating material in the warped pseudodisk to generate a coherent toroidal field for outflow driving ( a similar point was also made in seifried+2012,seifried+2013 ) .",
    "furthermore , the outflow , if driven at all , will consist of strands coming from different parts of the warped pseudodisk , which may have different orientations ; strands moving in different directions may lead to cancellation that weakens the net efficiency of the outward angular momentum transport by the outflow .",
    "we should note that , at smaller radii ( on the @xmath171 , rotationally supported disk - scale ) , the outflow in the @xmath67 case removes angular momentum more efficiently than that in the @xmath28 case .",
    "this outflow is driven by the rsd , and is thus a consequence of , rather than the cause for , the disk formation .",
    "nevertheless , it removes angular momentum from the rsd , and could threaten its survival ; it may have contributed to the destruction of the transient disks in the @xmath73 and @xmath32 cases ( models d and e in table 1 ) .      we have carried out several shorter duration simulations with different turbulent velocity fields to explore their effects on disk formation .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ power ] .",
    "they are identical to model f ( with @xmath67 and an exponent for the turbulent velocity spectrum @xmath172 ) , except for @xmath173 ( model u ) or @xmath174 ( model v ) . in both cases ,",
    "a rotationally supported disk is formed at the time shown ( @xmath175 ) , just as in model f. the disk is somewhat larger and better developed in model u than in model v , indicating that the shallower turbulent velocity spectrum ( with more power at shorter wavelength ) is more conducive to disk formation .",
    "however , we refrain from drawing more quantitative conclusions because the turbulent velocity fields are distorted by our non - uniform grid due to the undersampling of the high - frequency part of the velocity spectrum at large radii , where the spatial resolution is relatively coarse .",
    "the warping of pseudodisk out of the disk - forming equatorial plane by turbulence plays a central role in our interpretation of the robust disk formation observed in our simulations .",
    "pseudodisk warping was also the key ingredient of another proven mechanism for disk formation : misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis ( hennebelleciardi2009 ; joos+2012 ; krumholz+2013 ; li+2013 ) . since our problem setup is somewhat different from those of previous studies ( they included self - gravity that is ignored here , see   [ setup ] ) , we have rerun the non - turbulent case ( model a ) but with the magnetic field perpendicular to the rotation axis ( model p in table 1 ) . a robust rotationally supported disk is easily formed in this case , as shown in the left panel of fig .  [ t90 ] .",
    "as in the case with self - gravity , there are two prominent spiral arms in the equatorial density map of fig .",
    "[ t90 ] , which are part of a pseudodisk that lies almost perpendicular to the equatorial plane initially and is wrapped by rotation into a snail shell - like structure in 3d ( see fig .  2 of li+2013 ) .",
    "although the warping of the pseudodisk in model p is more extreme and less chaotic than that induced by the sonic turbulence ( @xmath67 ) in models f , u and v , the underlying physical reason for disk formation and survival appears broadly similar .",
    "specifically , the large field - rotation misalignment ensures that the bulk of the pseudodisk material stays out of the equatorial plane , which alleviates the problem of magnetic flux ( @xmath105 ) accumulation on the equatorial plane .",
    "this in turn eliminates the highly magnetized dems that is detrimental to disk formation ( zhao+2011 ; krasnopolsky+2012 ) , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "in addition , the misalignment decreases the rate of angular momentum removal from the pseudodisk by outflow ( ciardihennebelle2010 ; li+2013 ) and weakens the braking near the magnetic barrier , both of which leave more angular momentum in the accretion flow to form rsds .",
    "the turbulence- and misalignment - enabled disk formation are thus unified , in that both cause the pseudodisk to warp strongly out of the equatorial plane ( defined by rotation ) , which is conducive to disk formation .",
    "the pseudodisk that plays a central role in our scenario of rsd formation is a generic feature of the protostellar collapse channeled by a large - scale , dynamically significant magnetic field .",
    "this is because the material distributed along any given field line can not all collapse toward the center at the same rate ; some part is bound to collapse in a runaway fashion , as illustrated in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] .",
    "if a piece of matter on a field line is initially closer to the central object than the rest of the material along the same field line , it would experience a stronger gravitational acceleration , which would move it closer to the center , which would in turn increase its gravitational acceleration further .",
    "this differential collapse of matter along a field line drags the field line into a highly pinched configuration , which would not only allow matter to slide along the field line to the cusp but also compress the material collected there into a flattened structure  the pseudodisk ( gallishu1993 ; allen+2003 ) .",
    "it is the conduit for most of the core mass accretion with or without a turbulence , as discussed in   [ corrugation ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ densphere ] . as such",
    ", it is largely responsible for concentrating the magnetic flux at small radii that creates the difficulty for rsd formation in the first place .",
    "fortunately , it also holds the key to overcoming the difficulty .",
    "the key is the sharp field reversal across the pseudodisk ( see fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) . the highly pinched field lines are prone to magnetic reconnection , numerical or otherwise .",
    "there is little doubt that reconnection has occurred in all magnetized disk formation simulations to date that include turbulence ( santos - lima+2012,santos - lima+2013 ; seifried+2012,seifried+2013 ; joos+2013 ; myers+2013 ) .",
    "it is needed to explain the loss of magnetic flux near the central protostar relative to that expected under flux - freezing found in these simulations .",
    "@xcite was the first to study the flux loss , and attributed it to the turbulence - induced magnetic reconnection ( lazarianvishniac1999 ; kowal+2009 ) , which in their scenario is the key to disk formation ( see also santos - lima+2013 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the amount of flux loss increases with the level of turbulence , as one would expect if the flux loss is induced by turbulent reconnection .",
    "this is , however , not definitive proof of @xcite s scenario , because the turbulence - induced reconnection events remain to be identified in the simulations .",
    "we propose an alternative scenario for the reconnection that is required to explain the flux reduction observed in simulations , including our own : the magnetic decoupling - triggered reconnection of sharply pinched field lines .",
    "this alternative is motivated by the fact that gravitational collapse can naturally produce , by itself , sharply pinched field lines close to the central object that are prone to reconnection and that flux reduction is observed even in non - turbulent simulations , such as our models a and p ( see also zhao+2011 and krasnopolsky+2012 ) , which indicates that efficient reconnection can be achieved without any turbulence .",

    "however , unlike the case of flat equatorial pseudodisk , such field lines do not have to pass through the circumstellar , disk - forming region on the equatorial plane ; they can cross the equatorial plane at larger distances .",
    "the situation is qualitatively similar in the presence of a large field - rotation misalignment , which warps the plane of pseudodisk away from the plane of disk formation . in both cases ,",

    "our proposed scenario of rsd formation in turbulent magnetized dense cores thus involves two conceptually distinct steps : ( 1 ) decoupling - triggered reconnection of sharply pinched field lines close to the protostar , which removes the strong split magnetic monopole at the center , the first obstacle to disk formation , and ( 2 ) warping of the pseudodisk out of the disk - forming plane , which weakens the dems , the second obstacle to disk formation . compared to santos - lima et al.s scenario of turbulence - induced reconnection , it has the advantage of being capable of explaining the disk formation enabled by both turbulence and field - rotation misalignment . nevertheless , the two scenarios are not mutually exclusive .",

    "for example , field - matter decoupling must be present in any magnetized disk formation simulations involving sink particles , including those of @xcite , because the matter is accreted onto the sink particle but not the magnetic field .",
    "on the other hand , turbulence has been shown to enhance the reconnection rate of oppositely directed field lines , both analytically ( lazarianvishniac1999 ) and numerically ( e.g. , kowal+2009 ) , so the turbulence - induced reconnection is likely present in simulations , including our own , although its rate is difficult to quantify .",
    "we should stress that , even in santos - lima et al.s scenario , the pseudodisk is expected to play a central role : its sharply pinched field lines make it the most natural location for the turbulence - induced reconnection .",
    "furthermore , the warping of the pseudodisk , a key ingredient of our scenario , can help such reconnected field lines escape to large distances without passing through ( and being trapped in ) the equatorial , disk - forming region .",
    "one complication is that the turbulent motions are expected to be strongly modified , indeed dominated , by supersonic gravitational infall in the pseudodisk region close to the central object .",
    "the potential effect of such fast infall on the turbulence - induced magnetic reconnection remains to be quantified .",
    "another complication is that , in ideal mhd simulations , both turbulence - induced and decoupling - triggered reconnections involve numerical diffusion , which depends on numerical resolution .",
    "as such , it would be difficult to obtain numerically converged solutions .",
    "a key finding of our investigation is that the rotationally supported disks formed in turbulent , magnetized cloud cores are fed by highly variable , strongly warped pseudodisks .",
    "an interesting characteristic of such disks is their thickness .",
    "it is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ disk ] for model f ( with a turbulent mach number @xmath67 ) ; the figure is a zoom - in of fig .",
    "[ warpb ] ( see also the lower panels of fig .  [ power ] for models u and v ) . for comparison , we also plotted side - by - side the disk formed in a model that is neither magnetic nor turbulent , but with other parameters identical to those of model f ( model h in table 1 ) .",
    "the disk in the magnetized model f is smaller in radius and thicker ( relative to radius ) than that in the hydro model h. the smaller radius is to be expected because of angular momentum removal by magnetic braking and the associated outflow .",
    "the larger thickness may be due , at least in part , to the feeding of the disk by a strongly warped pseudodisk from directions that are highly variable and often tilted significantly away from the equatorial plane ( see auxiliary material online for a movie of mass accretion in a meridian plane ) ; indeed , the warped pseudodisk often feeds the rotationally support disk from the top and bottom surfaces , rather than the outer edge of the disk . as a result ,",
    "the disk is dynamically `` hotter '' ( with faster motions ) in the poloidal plane than that in the hydro case ( compare the disk velocity fields in fig .",
    "[ disk ] ; see below for another mechanism for puffing up the disk ) .",
    "another characteristic of the disks fed by warped pseudodisks is that they are significantly magnetized .",
    "this is because the pseudodisks are necessarily magnetized to a significant level since they are the product of magnetically - channeled gravitational collapse .",
    "significant magnetization is therefore expected for the disks as well .",
    "the degree of disk magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] , where we plot the time evolution of the ratios of magnetic to thermal and rotational to thermal energies for the disk ( defined somewhat crudely as the region denser than @xmath127 , a density corresponding to the blue isodensity surface in fig .",
    "[ 3dview ] ) for the sonic turbulence cases ( models f , u and v ) .",
    "it is clear that the magnetic energy dominates the thermal energy , by a factor of a few to several for all three cases .",
    "the magnetic energy is less than the rotational energy , however , by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the magnetic field is therefore expected to be wrapped by rotation into a predominantly toroidal configuration .",
    "this is indeed the case , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diskb ] , where representative magnetic field lines are plotted for the disk of model f shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "the toroidal field configuration is consistent with the recent dust polarization observations of the young disk in iras 16293b ( rao+2014 ) , hl tau ( stephens+2014 ) and l1527 ( segura - cox+2014 ) .",
    "the two characteristics of the disks discussed above ( large thickness and significant magnetization ) may be related .",
    "the rather strong toroidal field inside the disk provides an additional support ( on top of the thermal pressure ) to the gas in the vertical direction , which tends to puff up the disk .",
    "observational evidence for a puffed - up disk may already exist .",
    "@xcite inferred , through detailed modeling of the l@xmath176-band image , that the young disk in l1527 is thicker than those in more evolved sources on the @xmath81 scale ; it is about twice the disk scale - height estimated based on the thermal support alone . to puff up a disk by a factor of 2 ,",
    "an additional ( non - thermal ) energy density of @xmath165 times the thermal energy density is needed , since the scale - height is proportional to the square root of the total ( thermal and non - thermal ) energy density . from fig .",
    "[ ratio ] , it is clear that the required non - thermal energy is comparable to the magnetic energy in the disk .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the puffed - up disk in l1527 is an example of the kind of thick , dynamically active disks fed anisotropically by highly variable , strongly warped , magnetized pseudodisks that we find in our simulations ( and possibly in the simulations of santos - lima+2012,santos - lima+2013 ; seifried+2012,seifried+2013 ; myers+2013 and joos+2013 as well ) .",
    "high resolution observations of polarized dust emission from the disks of l1527 and other deeply embedded sources using sub / millimeter interferometers ( especially alma ) can help firm up or refute this interpretation . in any case , the disk thickness compared to the thermal scale - height can put an upper limit on the disk toroidal field strength , which is difficult to constrain through other means .      the picture of disk - feeding by a variable , warped magnetized pseudodisk ,",
    "if true in general , may have strong implications for the chemical connection between the collapsing core and the disk ; the connection is an important step toward understanding the chemical heritage of the solar system ( e.g. , caselliceccarelli2012 ; hincelin+2013 ) .",
    "first , if most of the disk - forming material comes from the magnetically compressed pseudodisk , its density before entering the rsd should be higher than that in the non - magnetic ( hydro ) case .",
    "the higher density could affect the rates of chemical reactions and ice formation ( for example , through shorter adsorption timescales , or perhaps three - body reactions if the density is high enough ) , and thus the gas and ice composition .",
    "second , disk - feeding through a highly variable pseudodisk means that any accretion shock , if exists at all , is strongly time dependent and spatially localized , unlike the simplest hydro case where a well - defined accretion shock encases the whole disk ( see , e.g. , yorke+1993 , and the right panel of fig .  [ disk ] ) .",
    "the shock structure is expected to be further modified by the magnetic field embedded in the pseudodisk . as a result ,",
    "the disk material may experience a rather different thermal history , which could affect both its gas and ice content ( e.g. , visser+2009 ) .",
    "third , if the disk is puffed up and dynamically active in the poloidal plane ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ disk ] ) , its rates of chemical reactions and vertical mixing would be affected .",
    "furthermore , the long - term evolution of the disk is expected to be strongly modified , perhaps dominated , by the rather strong ( toroidal ) magnetic field in the disk .",
    "a caveat is that the disk magnetic energy may be strongly affected by non - ideal mhd effects , which are expected to be important since the bulk of protostellar disks is lightly ionized ( armitage11 ; turner+2014 ) .",
    "the modifications need to be quantified in the future .",
    "another caveat is that , in our simulations , we included the gravity from a central object ( of @xmath65 ) but not the self - gravity of the gas .",
    "one consequence of this idealization is that the gravity is stronger at small radii compared to the more self - consistent case with self - gravity before the central object accretes @xmath65 .",
    "the stronger gravity is expected to accelerate the material in the pseudodisk to a higher infall speed relative to the more slowly collapsing material at larger distances that is magnetically connected to it .",
    "the higher relative speed is expected to stretch the field lines across the pseudodisk into a more severely pinched configuration , which should in turn compress the pseudodisk to a smaller thickness .",
    "this has the benefit of bringing the role of pseudodisk on disk formation into a sharper focus , but it may have exaggerated that role somewhat . nevertheless , the presence of a pseudodisk in self - gravitating magnetized protostellar collapse is well established .",
    "the fact that we are able to reproduce the known results that disk formation in non - turbulent cores is suppressed when the magnetic field and rotation axis are aligned ( model a ) and enabled when they are orthogonal ( model p ) gives us confidence that , despite the idealized setup , our results are qualitatively correct .",
    "it remains to be determined whether our quantitative results , such as the rsd formation enabled by a sonic ( @xmath67 ) turbulence in a @xmath177 core ( e.g. , model f ) , hold up or not when the self - gravity is included .",
    "we should note that the turbulence adopted in our simulations is somewhat ad hoc .",
    "it serves well the purposes of perturbing the pseudodisk and enabling disk formation , but how closely it resembles the real turbulence in dense cores of molecular clouds is unclear .",
    "this drawback will be harder to remedy , because the detailed properties of the turbulence , such as its energy spectrum , are not well quantified observationally on the core scale , although the situation should improve with high - resolution alma observations .",
    "we have carried out idealized numerical experiments of the accretion of a rotating , turbulent , but non - self - gravitating , dense core onto a pre - existing central stellar object in the presence of a moderately strong magnetic field .",
    "we found that , in agreement with previous work , the formation of a rotationally supported disk ( rsd ) is suppressed by the magnetic field in the absence of any turbulence ( or field - rotation misalignment ) and that an initial turbulence , if strong enough , can enable rsd formation .",
    "we identified the physically motivated magnetic decoupling - triggered reconnection of severely pinched field lines close to the central object and the warping of the pseudodisk out of the disk - forming , equatorial plane as two key ingredients of the turbulence - enabled disk formation , in contrast to the previously suggested scenario that relies exclusively on turbulence - induced reconnection ; in our picture , the field pinching that facilitates the reconnection arises primarily from ( anisotropic ) gravitational collapse rather than turbulence ( see fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "the decoupling - triggered reconnection weakens the split magnetic monopole near the protostar , which is the first obstacle to disk formation in a magnetized cloud core .",
    "the turbulence - induced pseudodisk warping weakens the so - called `` magnetic decoupling enabled structure '' ( dems ) , the second obstacle to disk formation , by reducing the amount of the magnetic flux trapped in the equatorial , disk - forming region .",
    "we also showed that the warping decreases the rates of angular momentum removal from the infalling material in the pseudodisk region by both magnetic torque ( especially near the so - called `` magnetic barrier , '' see fig .  [ pseudo ] ) and outflow , leaving more angular momentum to form a rotationally supported disk .",
    "the beneficial effects of warping the pseudodisk out of the disk - forming ( equatorial ) plane can also be achieved by a misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis . in this sense ,",
    "the turbulence- and misalignment - enabled disk formation mechanisms are unified .",
    "we emphasized that the pseudodisk is an unavoidable product of the highly anisotropic , magnetically - channeled gravitational collapse , even in the presence of turbulence .",
    "it is the main conduit for core mass accretion and its severely pinched field configuration makes it a natural place for the magnetic reconnection triggered by decoupling of both physical and numerical origin and possibly enhanced by turbulence .",
    "it feeds the rotationally supported disks formed in our turbulent , magnetized dense cores .",
    "these disks differ significantly from those formed in the non - turbulent , non - magnetic cores .",
    "they are thicker , more dynamically active in the poloidal plane , fairly strongly magnetized , and are not completely encased by an accretion shock",
    ". it will be interesting to determine whether these differences persist when the self - gravity of the material surrounding the stellar object is included and , if yes , to explore their implications , especially on the disk chemistry ( including ice ) and their long - term dynamical evolution ( including possible fragmentation and substellar object formation ) .      allen , a. , li , z .- y . , & shu , f. h. 2003 , , 599 , 363 armitage , p. j. 2011 , , 49 , 195 bodenheimer , p. 1995",
