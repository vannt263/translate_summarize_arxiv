    "the understanding of the microscopic origin of electron pairing in strongly correlated electron systems remains an ultimate goal in the field of unconventional superconductivity .",
    "generating cooper pairs from purely repulsive bare coulomb interactions , as for example in terms of exchange of antiferromagnetic spin excitations , requires distinctive properties of the resulting gap symmetry as given , for example , by a sign - changing superconducting gap in momentum space .",
    "thus , a detailed experimental determination of the superconducting gap structure and its evolution with e.g. temperature and electron filling is of crucial importance in order to unveil the constituents that drive the superconducting instability .",
    "local perturbations of the superconducting condensate as found , for example , near defect sites or vortex cores , constitute an important means to study the gap symmetry .",
    "this is because the low - energy states in the vicinity of such regions are highly dependent on the properties of the gap structure of the bulk superconducting phase.@xcite in the case of fe - based superconductors , scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) studies of bound , or quasi - bound , states near impurity sites have mapped out a rich series of tunneling spectra that still awaits quantitative theoretical modelling.@xcite complicating factors in this endeavor include the multi - band electronic structure of these materials and the orbital degrees of freedom of the scattering centers , resulting in substantial parameter dependence of the modelling.@xcite the scattering potential from vortex cores , on the other hand , does not contain orbital complexity / uncertainty , since it is entirely set by the quantum flux lines generated by the external field . in this respect , it may be more straightforward to deduce properties of the host superconducting gap symmetry from the measured tunneling conductance near vortex cores .    in fe - based superconductors a limited number of experimental studies have measured the detailed sub - gap tunneling conductance near vortex cores.@xcite for example hanaguri _",

    "lifeas exhibits a typical two - gap density of states spectrum with the inner ( outer ) gap edge at 2.9 mev ( 6.0 mev)@xcite composed , presumably , of mainly @xmath1 ( @xmath2/@xmath3 ) orbital character .",
    "the latter follows from a comparison of typical dft bandstructure results and the momentum - resolved gap structure as measured by arpes .",
    "@xcite    the main results of the sts study near the vortex cores of lifeas in ref .",

    "the peaks exhibit symmetry partners at positive bias , but significant anisotropy exists in their spectral weight .",
