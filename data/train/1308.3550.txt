    "various oscillation experiments have revealed non - zero masses of neutrinos .",
    "the observation shows that there exist two mass scales of neutrinos , the differences of mass squared @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite , related to the so - called atmospheric and solar neutrinos , respectively . in the ( canonical ) standard model neutrinos",
    "are exactly massless , and new physics beyond the standard model is indicated .",
    "the crucial questions are then ( i ) what is the origin of neutrino masses ? and ( ii ) how do we verify it experimentally ?    one of the simplest and most attractive ways to generate neutrino masses is to introduce right - handed neutrinos @xmath9 s into the standard model . in this case neutrinos can obtain the dirac masses as quarks and charged leptons . furthermore , since these neutral fermions are singlets under the gauge group of the standard model , the majorana masses of right - handed neutrinos are also allowed . notice that we should require at least two right - handed neutrinos in order to explain @xmath10 and @xmath11 . when the majorana masses are much heavier than the dirac ones , the smallness of neutrino masses can be explained by the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the mass eigenstates are then separated into three lighter and two heavier ones .",
    "the former ones are responsible to oscillation phenomena while the latter ones have not bean confirmed by experiments .    in this framework",
    "all the neutrinos are majorana particles , and the ( total ) lepton number is violated which may be tested by the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath12 ) decay .",
    "especially , when only two right - handed neutrinos are present , lightest ( active ) neutrino becomes massless and the predicted range of the rate for @xmath12 decay is very limited . interestingly , the future @xmath12 experiments may probe such a range in the inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "( see , for example , a review  @xcite )    on the other hand , right - handed neutrinos can also play important roles to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the concrete scenario for this baryogenesis strongly depends on the mass scales of right - handed neutrinos . in the canonical leptogenesis scenario  @xcite the lightest right - handed neutrino",
    "should be heavier than @xmath13 gev  @xcite when they have hierarchical masses .",
    "if @xmath9 s are produced non - thermally at the reheating of the inflation , the required mass can be small as @xmath14 gev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the resonant leptogenesis  @xcite by quasi - degenerate right - handed neutrinos is possible even for smaller masses of @xmath9 s .",
    "interestingly , the successful scenario of baryogenesis can be realized even if the masses are smaller than the electroweak scale  @xcite . in these extensions of the standard model ,",
    "therefore , the detailed examination of right - handed neutrinos is crucial in order to elucidate the mechanism to generate neutrino masses as well as the cosmic baryon asymmetry . for this purpose",
    ", the scenario with lighter @xmath9 s is more promising .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the standard model with two right - handed neutrinos which is probably the minimal extension to explain the neutrino oscillation results and the baryon asymmetry .",
    "especially , we assume masses of these neutral leptons are smaller than @xmath15 meson .",
    "such light @xmath9 s are good targets of the search experiments by using @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . it should be noted that , even when @xmath9 s are lighter than @xmath17 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 from the oscillation experiments can be explained via the seesaw mechanism by requiring that the yukawa coupling constants of neutrinos are sufficiently small , and also the enough baryon asymmetry can be generated via the mechanism  @xcite by requiring that the @xmath9 s are sufficiently degenerate .    under the above situation",
    ", we shall summarize the constraints on such light @xmath9 s from the direct search experiments as well as the cosmological observations , and then identify the allowed region in the parameter space of the model . in particular , the possible values of @xmath9 masses are presented , as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , we shall discuss the implications of the allowed parameter space .",
    "especially , we find that the majorana phase ( which is the one of the cp violating parameter in the lepton sector ) is restricted from the search and cosmological constraints when the inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses is considered . it will be then discussed that this leads to the important impact on the @xmath18 experiments in future .",
    "let us start with the framework of the present analysis .",

    "notice that we choose the basis in which the mass matrix of charged leptons and @xmath25 are diagonal .",
    "we assume that the dirac masses of neutrinos @xmath26 are much smaller than the majorana ones @xmath25 for the seesaw mechanism . in this case , the mass matrix of light neutrinos participating the observed flavor oscillation is given by @xmath27 . by using this relation ,",
    "we can parameterize , without loss of generality , the yukawa matrix @xmath23 as follows  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 with masses of light neutrinos @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "this parametrization is the same as that in ref .",
    "the mixing matrix of light neutrinos , called as the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix  @xcite , is written as @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is then found that the flavor neutrino @xmath35 is written in terms of mass eigenstates @xmath36 s and @xmath37 s as @xmath38 where each heavy neutrino @xmath37 almost coincides with @xmath9 , @xmath39 .",

    "in the case under consideration , there is one majorana phase @xmath41 in addition to dirac phase @xmath42 , and the lightest neutrino becomes exactly massless .",
    "thus , the possible patterns of neutrino masses are ( i ) the normal hierarchy ( nh ) with @xmath43 , and ( ii ) the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) with @xmath44 . we express the majorana mass matrix as @xmath45 and the @xmath46 matrix @xmath47 as @xmath48 in the nh case , while @xmath49 in the ih case . here",
