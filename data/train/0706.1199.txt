    "in recent years , fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems have drawn considerable attention to a new kind of fluctuation theorems .",
    "these fluctuation theorems are asymmetric relations for the distribution functions for work , heat , etc . , and may be satisfied even far from equilibrium states or for small systems in which the magnitude of the fluctuations can be large .",
    "these fluctuation theorems have been proved for deterministic thermostated systems @xcite as well as for stochastic systems @xcite , and have also been discussed in connection with the onsager - machlup fluctuation theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , experimental confirmations for these theorems have been obtained @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the fluctuation theorems include the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , as well as onsager s reciprocal relations , near equilibrium states @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite , based on a generalization of the onsager - machlup theory for fluctuations around equilibrium to those around nonequilibrium steady states using a path integral approach , we discussed fluctuation theorems for a stochastic dynamics described by a langevin equation . for a brownian particle driven by a mechanical force @xmath0 , the langevin equation for the particle position @xmath1 at time",
    "@xmath2 is of the general form @xmath3 with the mass @xmath4 of the particle , the friction coefficient @xmath5 and a random noise @xmath6 . in our previous paper , as a nonequilibrium model we considered a dragged brownian particle , in which the mechanical force is given by a harmonic force @xmath7 with the spring constant @xmath8 and the dragging velocity @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore we mainly considered this model under the over - damped assumption .",
    "this assumption can be used for a dynamics on a much longer time scale than the inertial characteristic time @xmath10 , and the dynamical equation under this assumption is simply given by neglecting the inertial term containing the mass in eq .",
    "( [ langeequat0a ] ) , i.e. by @xmath11 equation ( [ langeequat0b ] ) is much simpler than eq .",
    "( [ langeequat0a ] ) , but information of the system on the shorter time scale than @xmath12 is lost in eq .",
    "( [ langeequat0b ] ) .",
    "it may be noted that machlup and onsager already developed their fluctuation theory around equilibrium not only for the case corresponding to the over - damped case @xcite but also for the inertial case @xcite . in our previous paper",
    "we discussed also a generalization of the onsager - machlup theory for nonequilibrium steady states including the inertial term @xcite .",
    "however , there we treated only one type of fluctuation theorem , the so called transient fluctuation theorem @xcite , which is restricted to equilibrium initial conditions .",
    "another fluctuation theorem , the asymptotic fluctuation theorem @xcite , which holds for any initial condition ( including a nonequilibrium steady state @xmath13 ) , was not discussed for inertial cases in ref .",
    "different from the transient fluctuation theorem , which is correct for all times as a mathematical identity @xcite , the asymptotic fluctuation theorem is satisfied in the long time limit only .",
    "however , as we will discuss in this paper , a variety of interesting inertial effects appear for finite times for a nonequilibrium initial condition , before the asymptotic fluctuation theorem is achieved .",
    "although there are some results for fluctuation theorems for stochastic systems including inertia @xcite , the asymptotic fluctuation theorem with inertia has not been discussed fully in connection with the onsager - machlup theory so far .",
    "the purpose of this paper is therefore to discuss , in the context of the onsager - machlup path integral approach , inertial effects in nonequilibrium steady state work fluctuations , including the asymptotic fluctuation theorem . for these discussions we use the langevin equation ( [ langeequat0a ] ) for a dragged brownian particle without the over - damped assumption .",
    "the work distribution function is calculated explicitly for any initial condition , and its finite time properties are investigated . as an important inertial effect",
    "we show a critical value of mass above which the work distribution function shows a time - oscillatory behavior .",
    "the nonequilibrium work used in this paper is based on the generalized onsager - machlup theory , as obtained in our previous paper @xcite . in that paper we considered two kinds of work in two different frames : ( a ) the work @xmath14 done in the laboratory frame ( @xmath15 ) and ( b ) the work @xmath16 done in the comoving frame ( @xmath17 ) where the average velocity of the brownian particle is zero in a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "a difference between these two works is that @xmath16 includes a dalembert - like force , which is absent in @xmath14 . in this paper , we show that both the works @xmath14 and @xmath16 satisfy the asymptotic fluctuation theorem .",
    "we also discuss dramatic differences between the work distribution functions for @xmath14 and @xmath16 for finite times .",
