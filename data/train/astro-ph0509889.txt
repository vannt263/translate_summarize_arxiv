    "the double pulsar j0737@xmath03039  is one of the most extraordinary systems in all of astronomy .",
    "it consists of a recycled pulsar (  a  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a period of 22.7  ms , in a 2.4  hr eccentric binary orbit ( @xmath4 ) with a young pulsar (  b  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that has a 2.8  s period .",
    "since both neutron stars in the highly relativistic binary system are detected as radio pulsars , unprecedented tests of theories of gravitation are possible . in addition , the orbit is tight enough that the relativistic wind from a interacts with the magnetosphere of b , providing a unique laboratory for studying the energy dissipation of neutron stars .",
    "the j0737@xmath03039  system offers an astonishing variety of observational surprises @xcite . the wind from",
    "a apparently regulates the pulsed emission from b , which is bright only at certain parts of its orbit .",
    "( in fact , this intermittency was responsible for b not being detected simultaneously with a. ) single pulses from b show features drifting at the beat frequency between the periods of the two pulsars , reflecting the direct impact of electromagnetic radiation from a on b @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , since the plane of the orbit is almost edge - on to our line of sight , a undergoes a short eclipse @xcite when it passes behind b. in a remarkable analysis , @xcite showed that the eclipse of a is modulated at half the rotational period of b and ascribed the phase - dependent opacity to synchrotron absorption in a cometary magnetosheath ( as suggested by @xcite ) that surrounds and rotates with b. more recently , @xcite suggest that relativistically hot dense plasma confined by the magnetic field of pulsar b scatters emission from a at synchrotron resonance , leading to the observed phase - dependent opacity .",
    "based on an atca ( australia telescope compact array ) observation , @xcite reported that the radio flux density from j0737@xmath03039  was @xmath5  mjy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "( as is standard practice , all pulsar flux densities discussed here are averaged over pulse phase . ) with the discovery of b , @xcite measured individual pulsar flux densities of @xmath6  mjy for a and @xmath7  mjy for b , for an orbital phase - averaged pulsed flux density of @xmath8  mjy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "they suggested that the remaining @xmath9  mjy was unpulsed emission that arose from the interaction of the relativistic winds of a and b. such an interaction also provides a possible explanation for the x - ray emission from the system , as detected by _",
    "chandra _ in a brief ( 10  ks ) observation @xcite .",
    "somewhat deeper _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations @xcite show no evidence for any modulation in the x - ray emission , and the existing x - ray data do not necessarily require interaction between the two pulsars , but deeper observations ( planned for late 2005 ) will be required for a definite conclusion .",
    "much theoretical effort has gone into interpreting the unusual richness of behavior exhibited by j0737@xmath03039   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest that the unpulsed radio emission from j0737@xmath03039  may be synchrotron emission from the magnetosheath of b enhanced by gyrophase bunching , while @xcite propose that it arises either from a shock - heated electron cloud , or from a bow shock surrounding b s cometary magnetosheath .",
    "either scenario has interesting implications for our understanding of relativistic winds from neutron stars .",
    "we note , however , that the existence of unpulsed emission is not required by models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "are listed in .",
    "j0737@xmath03039  was detected at 1.6 and 4.8  ghz , and we fit elliptical gaussians to the images ( task jmfit in aips ) to determine the source position and flux density .",
    "the source flux density is @xmath52  mjy at 1.6  ghz and @xmath53  mjy at 4.8  ghz , which leads to a spectrum @xmath54 , as plotted in . at 8.4  ghz",
    ", we do not detect the pulsar , but place an upper limit of 0.06  mjy ( @xmath55 ) on its flux density . as shown in ,",
    "such an upper limit is consistent with the measured spectral index .",
    "the shortest integration time possible at the vla is 1.66  s , so that the rotational phase of either pulsar a or b is impossible to resolve .",
    "however , the 1.6  ghz vla observations have sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to permit estimates of the system flux density over several bins in binary orbital phase . based on the observations presented by @xcite",
    ", b is expected to be detectably brighter ( i.e. , to cause the j0737@xmath03039  system to have a detectably higher flux density ) between orbital phases of @xmath56274 and 297 , and brightest between @xmath56196 and 224 , at the time of our vla observations ( 2004 november ) . meanwhile , a undergoes its brief eclipse at an orbital phase of 90 .",
    "( in each case , orbital phase is measured as the sum of the longitude of periastron and the true anomaly of the respective pulsars , so that a and b are always 180  apart in their orbital phase . )    in order to estimate the flux density of j0737@xmath03039  over bins in orbital phase , all the field sources first have to be accounted for .",
    "an interferometer samples different points in the visibility ( spatial frequency ) plane as the earth rotates over the course of an observation , leading to a time - varying beam pattern .",
    "we account for this effect by first imaging the entire data span ( as described above ) and then subtracting the modeled contributions of each background source from the interferometric visibilities .",
    "the remainder consists of the contributions of the two pulsars , a and b , along with the thermal noise and any systematic errors due to unmodeled source contributions .",
    "these residuals were binned in time , using published pulse timing solutions @xcite to predict the orbital phase as observed from the vla .",
    "finally , images were created from the data in each time bin , and an elliptical gaussian at a known ( fixed ) position was fit to the image to determine the flux density of j0737@xmath03039 .",
    "orbital phase - resolved flux densities at 1.6  ghz are plotted in .",
    "we find that the flux density of the j0737@xmath03039  system ( a + b ) is @xmath57  mjy when b is brightest ( orbital phase @xmath56196224 ) , @xmath58  mjy when it is weakly detectable , and @xmath59  mjy when it is faint and only a is expected to be visible .",
    "these estimates are completely consistent with the measurements of @xcite , as listed in .",
    "we also created short time bins at and around the eclipse of a. while j0737@xmath03039was not detected in the bin corresponding to the eclipse of a , we lack the s / n to place a significant upper limit on the total flux density in that short ( @xmath60 minute ) time interval .",
    "at 1.6  ghz , we find an orbital phase - averaged flux density of @xmath61  mjy for j0737@xmath03039 , consistent with the sum of the pulsed emission from a and ( intermittently ) b. our phase - resolved measurements are also consistent with this picture . after subtracting the pulsed flux density ( @xmath561.8  mjy ; * ? ? ? * ) , there is no evidence for any unpulsed flux , and we can rule out the existence of unpulsed emission at the @xmath62  mjy level ( @xmath63 ) .    given the discrepancy with previous work , we have examined the archival atca data that form the basis for the claimed unpulsed emission , as well as archival vla b - array data at 1.4  ghz ( see ) .",
    "the vla b - array data span only 40  minutes ( when b spans an orbital phase range of 96  to 197 ) , and after standard calibration , we find a flux density of @xmath64  mjy for j0737@xmath03039 .",
    "as shown in , this is consistent with the spectrum derived from 1.6 and 4.8  ghz vla a - array observations .",
    "there is also no evidence for any extended structure , and the mean flux density is @xmath65jy  beam@xmath66 in an annulus between 10  and 100  from the pulsar .",
    "the atca data were calibrated within miriad , and then imaged in aips . due to limited coverage of the visibility plane ,",
    "the data are comparatively more difficult to self - calibrate and image . after discarding data in the inner visibility plane and only retaining data between 5 and 20  k@xmath67",
    ", we find a flux density of @xmath68  mjy for j0737@xmath03039 , inconsistent with the value of @xmath69  mjy reported by @xcite .",
    "we suggest three possible causes for the discrepancy : ( 1 ) there are many sources in the field ( ) , and it is possible , though unlikely , that the flux density may have been transcribed for an incorrect one ; ( 2 ) the atca data on j0737@xmath03039  were acquired in pulsar binning mode , while data on the calibrators ( b1934@xmath0638 and b0727@xmath0365 ) were acquired in the standard mode , necessitating the scaling of amplitudes to obtain correct flux densities .",
    "we have averaged all the pulsar bins in our analysis of the atca data to avoid the need for scaling . and",
    "( 3 ) there may be a very faint extended nebula surrounding the pulsar , and contributing flux density on scales @xmath70 , which we have excised but that @xcite retained .",
    "the last scenario is rather unlikely , but can not be definitively ruled out yet . in any case , the vla observations , acquired at different times , frequencies , and array configurations , provide a more reliable estimate of the flux density of j0737@xmath03039  itself .",
    "we have thus detected j0737@xmath03039  at 1.6 and 4.8  ghz , derived a spectral index of @xmath71 , and placed an upper limit on its flux density at 8.4  ghz .",
    "orbital modulation due to b is detected in the 1.6  ghz data .",
    "both orbital phase - resolved and phase - averaged measurements at 1.6  ghz are consistent with the entire flux density arising from the pulsed emission of a and b. we find no evidence for unpulsed emission , and limit it to less than 0.5  mjy ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is a disappointing conclusion for theories that attempted to relate the unpulsed radio emission and x - ray emission to a common origin in a shock created by the interaction between a and b. if the x - ray emission also turns out to have an `` ordinary '' origin in the magnetosphere of a , rather than being produced by the interaction between two relativistic winds , then the processes involved in the energy dissipation of neutron stars will have proven more elusive than expected .",
