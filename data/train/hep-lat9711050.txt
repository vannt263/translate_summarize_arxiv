    "there are several ways of approximating heavy quarks in lattice qcd calculations , including nonrelativistic qcd @xcite ( nrqcd ) , the static approximation @xcite , and the approach developed at fermilab @xcite which takes the uncorrected wilson action as its leading approximation but adds correction operators which end up resembling those of nrqcd rather than those of the standard symanzik improvement of the wilson action @xcite .",
    "nrqcd is based on an expansion in nonrelativistic operators ( rotationally invariant but not lorentz invariant ) similar to that used in calculating relativistic corrections in the hydrogen atom",
    ". it can be thought of as arising from a discretization of the action arising from a foldy - wouthuysen - tani transformation of the quark fields analogous to the one used in atomic physics .",
    "@xmath3 leads to the action @xmath4 the pole mass term does not affect the dynamics of nonrelativistic systems and is conventionally dropped .    in @xmath5 physics ,",
    "the simplest of all the methods can be used , the static approximation .",
    "this approximates the heavy quark propagator with a simple wilson line moving in the time direction , giving an action corresponding to the first term in eqn .",
    "it is clearly most useful for the heaviest quarks .",
    "it is not much used recently because it has a much worse signal to noise ratio than nrqcd , which is clear in retrospect but was not foreseen",
    ".    the third method can be thought of as arising from a partial fwt transformation : @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are between 0 and 1 .",
    "this appears to be a crazy thing to do , producing an action which combines the defects of the transformed and the untransformed actions , which indeed it does . on the other hand , it turns out that this is the action we have been stuck with for a long time .",
    "the wilson action has just this form at leading order .",
    "the @xmath11 term added to cure the doubling problem also contributes to the kinetic energy , as in eqn .",
    "[ partialftw ] .",
    "furthermore , perhaps surprisingly , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 implied by the wilson action have the desired property that the nonrelativistic @xmath11 term takes over automatically from the dirac style kinetic energy term @xmath12 as @xmath13 in the wilson action .",
    "the wilson action automatically turns into a nonrelativistic action in the large mass limit .",
    "the wilson action does have the unwanted property that for large masses the pole mass does not equal the kinetic mass governing the energy momentum relation @xmath14 in nonrelativistic systems , the pole mass does not affect the dynamics and the kinetic mass governs the leading important term . therefore , the pole mass term is normally simply omitted from the action in nrqcd , although there is no harm ( and no benefit ) in including it .",
    "likewise , the wilson action can be used without problems for nonrelativistic systems as long as @xmath15 and not the pole mass is used to set the quark mass .",
    "it is easy to find a wilson style action which does satisfy @xmath16 by letting the hopping parameter for the time direction , @xmath17 , differ from the one in the spatial directions , @xmath18 .",
    "the wilson action corrected up to @xmath19 and the action of nrqcd both use one - hop time derivatives .",
    "when the quarks are heavy , this is a requirement , since two - hop time derivatives introduce new ghost states and imaginary energies when @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the wilson action applied to heavy paths can not follow the conventional symanzik program of using two - hop corrections at @xmath21 , but must follow the nrqcd style of corrections which correct only the spatial interactions .",
    "the existence of the hamiltonian and the transfer matrix ensures that this is possible .",
    "the parameters of the action in this approach must have nontrivial mass dependence for large masses , just as do those of nrqcd . for large masses , the wave function normalization , the relation between the mass and the hopping parameter , etc .",
    ", are completely different from their @xmath22 values . when @xmath23 ( in lattice units ) , this mass dependence may be expanded in power series . for the wilson and sheikholeslami - wohlert actions",
    "@xcite , this yields just the usual series of operators , with the same coefficients : @xmath24 thus , while for @xmath25 the action becomes very similar to nrqcd in its behavior , for @xmath23 it may be regarded as an all orders in m resummation of the usual operators of the wilson and sw actions . for hadrons containing charmed quarks , it is possible to do calculations with the wilson and sw actions even with the old interpretation of the coefficients .",
    "however , since @xmath26 , the ability to sum up the required series in @xmath27 exactly is likely to produce a much faster approach to the continuum limit .",
    "here we use this approach to calculate the spectrum of @xmath28 annd @xmath29 mesons .",
    "the strong interactions of a meson containing a single heavy quark simplify in the infinite mass limit .",
    "the heavy - quark spin and the light - quark total angular momentum , @xmath30 , are separately conserved .",
    "states with total spin @xmath31 form degenerate - mass doublets .",
    "hence , the hyperfine splitting between the vector , @xmath32 , and the pseudoscalar , @xmath33 , is zero .",
    "heavy quark symmetry is only approximate at finite quark mass so the hyperfine splittings for   and mesons are proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "the sensitivity of the hyperfine splitting to the heavy - quark mass makes spectroscopy of the  and  mesons an important check on the procedure used to determine the bare charm and bottom masses .",
    "the bare masses are important inputs to our programs to determine the renormalized quark masses and weak matrix elements of the  and mesons@xcite .",
    "heavy - quark masses in this study are determined in quarkonia .",
    "the bare mass is found by demanding the experimental spin - averaged meson mass match the kinetic mass determined from the lattice energy - momentum dispersion relation@xcite .",
    "quark masses may also be determined by studying heavy - light mesons .",
    "these masses will differ from the masses in -onia since lattice spacing errors differ for the two methods@xcite .",
    "mass errors with either method however lead to bounded uncertainties in quantities such as hadron mass splittings and matrix elements .",
    "moreover , quark - mass uncertainties in these quantities are overcome by extrapolation to zero lattice spacing .",
    "we study pseudoscalar and vector mesons on the four ensembles of quenched wilson glue described in .",
    "lattice spacings are determined using the charmonium  splitting .",
    "spacings range from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the coarsest lattice only provide a check upon cutoff effects ; results are not used for continuum extrapolations .",
    "we use sheikholeslami wohlert ( sw ) quarks with tree - level tadpole improvement . the clover coefficient , @xmath37 ,",
    "is determined from the average plaquette ( see ) .",
    "calculations are done directly at the charm and bottom quark masses using .",
    "results are fully @xmath1 improved .",
    "bare strange - quark masses are determined from the light pseudoscalar spectrum using leading - order chiral perturbation theory and the experimental @xmath38 and @xmath39 masses .",
    "meson masses are extracted from minimum @xmath40 multistate fits to a matrix of meson correlators having coulomb - gauge 1s- and 2s - smeared sources and sinks .",
    "the full covariance matrix is retained in fits .",
    "[ fig : hfs ] shows the   and  hyperfine splittings for the lattices in .",
    "results from the three finest lattices are extrapolated linearly to @xmath41 .",
    "the  slope has an error bound consistent with zero .",
    "hence errors from the charm mass determination are barely discernible with present statistics .",
    "the  slope is more significant indicating larger errors in the bottom quark mass determination . reducing the lattice spacing decreases the   splitting .",
    "this is consistent with an underestimation of the bottom quark mass in -onia@xcite .",
    "the extrapolated  and   hyperfine splittings are consistent with experimental values .",
    "the central values however lie below experiment .",
    "this may be an indication that the quenched  and hyperfine splittings are smaller than experiment .",
    "note that the quenched hyperfine splittings in quarkonia lie significantly below experiment .",
    "higher statistics are necessary to determine if there is a similar quenching effect for heavy - light mesons .",
    "the ratio of the  hyperfine splitting to the  splitting , @xmath42 , is proportional to @xmath43 according to heavy quark symmetry .",
    "the ratio is expected to be less sensitive to quenching errors than the individual splittings .",
    "the linear extrapolation in yields @xmath44 .",
    "this compares well with the experimental value @xmath45 .",
    "this is evidence that our procedure for determining the bare quark masses leads to the correct continuum result .",
    "we also study 2s states .",
    "excited state statistical errors are an order of magnitude larger than ground state errors .",
    "excited states are also subject to larger systematic errors .",
    "combined errors are comparable to the spin splittings .",
    "hence we report only the spin - averaged 2s splitting , @xmath46 .    according to heavy quark symmetry splitting",
    "@xmath46 is constant up to @xmath47 corrections .",
    "we check this in by computing the ratio of   splittings for   and .",
    "the deviation from unity is consistent with @xmath47 effects .",
    "we summarize our continuum   and  spectroscopy results in .",
    "results are plotted in relation to @xmath34 to emphasize the behavior of the splittings in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we compare to experimental values for the 1s states .",
    "a potential model inspired estimate for @xmath46 is also shown@xcite .",
    "our lattice results are consistent with experiment .    fig .",
    "[ fig : charmonium ] shows our most recent charmonium spectrum , which we will use in our discussion in the next section .",
    "it is mainly a statistical updating of our previous results , except for the @xmath48 states .",
    "these have been done using nonrelativistic operators for the first time rather than quark antiquark bilinears .",
    "this allows us to obtain a result for the @xmath49 for the first time .",
    "the correction operators of nrqcd are simple and easy to organize .",
    "nrqcd quark propagators can be calculated almost instantaneously .",
    "heavy quark actions which start from the wilson action have the advantage that they continue to work as the @xmath50 limit is taken .",
    "however , correcting them to @xmath21 or to @xmath51 is messier than for nrqcd .",
    "the action of nrqcd is an expansion around @xmath52 and is better and better behaved , the larger the quark mass .",
    "it breaks down in two distinct ways as @xmath53 becomes larger . when @xmath54 gets larger than 1 , perturbative calculability of coefficient functions breaks down due to factors of @xmath54 in the diagrams .",
    "when @xmath55 gets larger than 1 , the convergence of the series of nonrelativistic operators breaks down .",
    "this series is very convergent for the @xmath56 quark , and nrqcd works very well in @xmath5 and @xmath57 physics .",
    "the @xmath58 system is reasonably nonrelativistic , too , as shown by the success of potential models .",
    "nrqcd works reasonably well for this system , too , although in some cases not as well as originally hoped .",
    "for example , a recent investigation @xcite of the effects of @xmath59 corrections in nrqcd studied their effect on the hyperfine splitting of charmonium . in results of a few years ago , the @xmath60 , @xmath61 improved nrqcd results lay much closer to the experimental answer than the @xmath19 improved relativistic fermilab results .",
    "the interpretation seemed to be that the higher order corrections included in the nrqcd calculations made these results much more accurate than the less improved relativistic results .",
    "however , last year trottier calculated some of the @xmath59 terms which contribute to the hyperfine splitting and found results which made a big jump back down toward zero .",
    "the actual situation seems to be that the @xmath62 expansion is very slow to converge for some quantities in the charmonium system .",
    "the ability of the harder to improve relativistic formalism to recover a dirac - like form of the action in the @xmath50 limit is an advantage here .    for @xmath56 quark physics ,",
    "the situation is somewhat reversed . here , the nonrelativistic expansion is well - converged after a few orders .",
    "( potential models estimate that @xmath62 is about 1/4 in the @xmath63 and about 1/10 in the @xmath57 . ) on the other hand , these corrections have to be included to achieve high accuracy .",
    "one does not have the option of replacing them and letting the relativistic @xmath12 terms in the action of ref . @xcite",
    "take over when @xmath64 .",
    "this would require an absurdly high lattice spacing .    a case where this plays a more significant role than had been expected is in the quantity @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite in the quarkonium systems , the quark momentum @xmath66 as @xmath67",
    ". therefore , @xmath68 errors and @xmath69 errors also go to infinity in absolute terms , but approach fixed percentages of leading order physical quantities . in heavy - light systems on the other hand , the @xmath56 quark s momentum @xmath70 as @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 errors and @xmath69 errors due to the @xmath56 quark approach constants in absolute terms .    of the pole and kinetic masses in the equation @xmath71 @xmath72",
    "is more affected by @xmath62 errors than @xmath73 since it is higher order .",
    "for example , we can obtain the spin  averaged @xmath74 splittings in the @xmath75 and @xmath76 systems from the data from figs .",
    "we obtain 0.81 gev in the charm system , compared with 1.08 gev experimentally .",
    "we obtain -1.68 gev in the bottom system compared with 1.35 gev experimentally .",
    "kronfeld used potential models to show that this was roughly what was to be expected .",
    "@xcite the analogous effect in nrqcd improved only to @xmath77 is about 15% .",
    "@xcite    it should be stressed that as a percentage error , no error in @xmath5 or @xmath57 physics is blowing up as @xmath78 .",
    "for example , the uncertainty induced in determinations of @xmath79 from the 20% ambiguity of using @xmath80 or @xmath81 to determine the @xmath56 quark mass is only of order a few per cent , as can be seen by examining a graph of @xmath82 vs. @xmath83 .",
    "it is simply one of the @xmath84 errors known to be present in the @xmath77 improved theory . on the other hand , it is probably reduced from @xmath85 to @xmath86 by obtaining @xmath87 from @xmath80 rather than @xmath81 in this case .",
    "it has been argued many times that quarkonia are nice systems to use for error analysis and parameter setting because of the tools that are available for understanding the errors .",
    "when those tools tell us that some errors in quarkonia are rather large , that strategy may sometimes have to be altered .    for pure @xmath5 meson physics ( not considering the @xmath57 system )",
    ", the situation is probably not as bad for `` relativistic '' heavy quark actions .",
    "( relativistic is in quotes because for @xmath56 systems , relativistic @xmath12 terms in the action have almost no effect compared with the nonrelativistic @xmath88 terms . ) in these systems , @xmath62 correction terms are probably negligible since @xmath89 .",
    "it is therefore possible that an @xmath77 improved heavy quark theory such as the heavy sw action may do an adequate job here .",
    "perturbative corrections to decay constants , etc . , are more annoying to calculate than for nrqcd or the @xmath22 wilson theory , but by no means intractable .",
