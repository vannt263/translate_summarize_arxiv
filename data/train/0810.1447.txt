    "in order to increase the critical parameters of both low- and high-@xmath2 superconductors , in the last years great efforts were directed towards the optimization of the vortex confinement in these systems .",
    "the enhancement of the vortex pinning can be obtained using periodic arrays of different types of artificial defects in superconducting thin films , such as periodic variation of thin film composition @xcite or heavy ion irradiation @xcite .",
    "progress in the fabrication of nanostructures by lithography has given access to a wide variety of well controlled vortex regular pinning arrays at sub - micron length scales @xcite .",
    "experiments performed on this kind of samples revealed the presence of peaks in the magnetic field dependence of the critical current density @xmath3 @xcite at matching fields @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an integer and @xmath6 is the value of the field at which the vortex lattice spacing is equal to the period of the regular array of submicrometer defects , _ a _ : @xmath7 .",
    "recently a radically different approach to nanostructures fabrication based on self assembled growth @xcite , such as chemically anisotropic etching of single crystals , attracted much attention also in the superconducting field .",
    "these processes are useful for generating , on large areas , low - cost simple patterns of nanostructures in a single step , assuring a high reproducibility as well .",
    "moreover , these techniques give the opportunity to produce regular periodic structures with features that can be even an order of magnitude smaller than the ones obtained by time consuming e - beam lithography process , leading to templates having features comparable with the characteristic superconducting lengths . in particular , the reduced dimensions are of great importance in the enhancement of the superconducting pinning properties , since smaller interpore spacing implies higher matching fields down to lower temperatures . at this purpose transport and magnetic measurements",
    "were already performed on nb thin films grown on nanoporous al@xmath8o@xmath9 templates with pores diameter in the range 25 - 150 nm @xcite .",
    "anomalies in the @xmath10 as well as in the temperature dependence of the perpendicular upper critical field @xmath0 were observed .",
    "the aim of this work is to present the superconducting properties of nb thin films deposited on porous silicon ( ps ) substrates fabricated by electrochemical etching of monocrystalline si in an hf solution .",
    "porous silicon is constituted by a network of pores immersed in a nanocrystalline matrix @xcite . as a result",
    ", ps is characterized by a very large chemically reactive internal surface area , which makes this material promising for many technological applications in different fields , as for instance micro and optoelectronics , gas sensing , and biotechnology ; recently ps was also applied as a substrate for the nanotubes growth @xcite .",
    "the reason to choose ps as a template for superconducting thin films deposition is twofold . on one hand si",
    "based substrates are good candidates for the nb growth . moreover , the characteristic pore features of these ps substrates are the smallest used in superconducting field at this purpose .",
    "the porous area of our substrates extends , in fact , on about 1 @xmath11 and it is constituted by pores of mean diameter , @xmath12 , tunable between 5 and 10 nm , with interpore spacing ( the distance between the centers of two nearest pores ) , @xmath13 , that can be varied from 10 to 40 nm .",
    "it is worth to underline that the regularity of the pores arrangement in ps substrates is lower than the one observed in al@xmath8o@xmath9 templates obtained by electrochemical oxidation @xcite .",
    "however it has been recently shown that the interaction of the vortex lattice with templates of artificial pinning centers presenting a short - range order can also give rise to peculiar behavior of both critical magnetic fields and critical currents @xcite . in the same way",
    ", thin nb films deposited on ps substrates can inherit their structure , resulting in porous nb thin films with in plane geometrical dimensions , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , comparable with the superconducting coherence length , @xmath14 .",
    "this reduced periodicity could reflect in peculiar properties of porous thin films , that could be interesting also in view of possible application .",
    "for instance tuning the samples geometry ( @xmath13 , @xmath12 ) we expect to be able to control the superconducting critical temperature , to reach higher matching fields and eventually also higher critical currents , down to lower temperatures .",
    "the superconducting properties of porous nb thin films have been probed by transport measurements in presence of magnetic fields applied in the direction perpendicular to the samples surface . as a consequence of the high density of the pore network ,",
    "the ( h , t ) phase diagrams present a deviation from the classical behavior of @xmath0 , and the @xmath15 behavior shows fingerprints of the periodic anomaly typical of superconducting wire networks .",
    "both these effects appear at fields up to @xmath16 tesla .",
    "this value is larger than typical matching fields of periodic pinning arrays obtained both by lithographic techniques and by using self - organized al@xmath8o@xmath9 templates .",
    "porous layers were fabricated by electrochemical anodic etching of p - type , 12 @xmath17 cm , and n - type , 0.01 @xmath17 cm , monocrystalline silicon wafers in 48% water solution of hf at the current density of 25 ma/@xmath11 .",
    "n - type silicon wafers were anodized with light exposition by 100 w tungsten lamp as well without light illumination . the anodization time was chosen in the range of 0.5 - 4 min in order to get porous layers with a thickness ranging from 0.5 to 4 @xmath18 m .",
    "the integral porosity was estimated by gravimetry to be in the range from 30% up to 60% @xcite . for p - type silicon wafers the nominal pore diameter and the interpore spacing are respectively @xmath19 nm and @xmath20 nm . in the case of n - type silicon wafers",
    "the nominal pore diameter is @xmath21 nm , while the values of @xmath13 are expected to be 20 nm for light exposed substrates and 40 nm for samples obtained without illumination .",
    "the electron back scatter diffraction ( ebsd ) technique has been used to investigate the microstructure of both p - type and n - type porous silicon wafers .",
    "ebsd patterns were obtained from leo evo 50 scanning electron microscope with an oxford inca detector . in order to optimize the contrast in the diffraction pattern and the fraction of electrons scattered from the sample ,",
    "the substrates were tilted so that an angle of @xmath22 is formed between the normal to the sample surface and the electron beam @xcite .",
    "ebsd patterns were acquired on porous and non - porous regions of the two different substrates . fig .",
    "[ ebsd ] shows crystal orientation map of a 3 mm by 0.5 mm area for a n - type substrate with a spatial resolution of about 80 @xmath23m@xmath24 .",
    "the scanned area was selected crossing the interface between the etched ( porous ) and un - etched ( non - porous ) silicon wafer .",
    "the color uniformity of the map reveals that in this area all the crystalline components have ( 111 ) orientation .",
    "similarly , the same analysis performed on p - type substrate showed ( 100 ) crystallographic orientation on both porous and non - porous region . in both cases",
    "the etching process does not influence the crystalline properties of the substrates .",
    "nb thin films were grown on top of the porous si substrates in a uhv dc diode magnetron sputtering system with a base pressure in the low @xmath25 mbar regime and sputtering argon pressure of @xmath26 mbar .",
    "reference films were grown in each deposition run on standard non - porous si(100 ) substrates . in order to reduce the possible contamination of the porous templates",
    ", the substrates were heated at @xmath27c for one hour in the uhv chamber .",
    "the deposition was then realized at room temperature after the cool off of the system .",
    "the films were deposited at typical rates of 0.3 nm / s , controlled by a quartz crystal monitor calibrated by low - angle reflectivity measurements . since the effect of the periodic template",
    "would be reduced when the film thickness , @xmath28 , exceedes the pore diameter , @xmath12 , the nb thickness was allowed to range between 8.5 and 15 nm .",
    "all the samples deposited on porous si , their names and thicknesses , and the substrate characteristics as well , are summarized in table [ table ] . for the sake of clarity",
    "the samples were named using the initials si followed by a number indicating the nominal substrate interpore distance , @xmath13 , and by another number for the nb thickness .",
    "for example , si40-nb12 is the nb film 12 nm thick , grown on the porous substrate with @xmath29 nm .",
    "the pore diameter is in this case @xmath21 nm .",
    "the morphology of the ps substrates as well as of the nb thin films deposited on them was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy ( fesem ) .",
    "to allow fesem measurements on highly resistive ps substrates , metallization with 8 nm pd / au thin film was realized . a typical fesem micrograph ( magnification = 500000 ) of the top of the si20 substrate",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fesem_si](a ) .",
    "at this high magnification the pores can be clearly distinguished as dark areas surrounded by pd / au molecular agglomerates . fig .",
    "2a also reveals that the pore entrances are not regular circles .",
    "several micrographs obtained on ps templates were analyzed in order to evaluate the pore diameter and the interpore spacing distributions resulting from the electrochemical etching . in order to take into account the pores shape we evaluated an equivalent pore diameter , defined as the diameter of a circle having the same surface area of the pore .",
    "the latter was obtained by the help of imagetool , a software for image analysis , which enables to supply the surface area of a region drawing a polygon around its outline . the evaluated pore size distribution of the ps layer",
    "is reported in figure 2b ( mean diameter @xmath30 nm and standard deviation @xmath31 nm ) . moreover ,",
    "the mean interpore distance @xmath32 nm with a standard deviation of @xmath33 nm ( figure 2c ) were estimated . in fig .",
    "[ fesem_low ] a low resolution fesem image of the si wafer edge is reported . along this edge , at about 10 @xmath18 m from the top surface , a change in the morphology can be distinguished , indicating the presence of a porous layer of about 10 @xmath18 m , in agreement with sample specifications .",
    "all these values are in very good agreement with the expected nominal ones and indicate the effectiveness of the porogenic treatment . in fig .",
    "[ fesem_nl ] a secondary electron fesem image ( magnification = 800000 ) of a dedicated nb film , 9 nm thick , deposited on a si20 substrate is shown .",
    "again , the pores restrict the solid angle from which low energy electrons can escape , thus rendering the pores dark and the top surface light .",
    "the surface appearance , far from being perfectly ordered , however clearly reveals the presence of holes in the nb layer .",
    "the superconducting properties , critical temperatures @xmath34 , and perpendicular upper critical fields as a function of the temperature , @xmath0 , were resistively measured in a @xmath35he cryostat using a standard dc four - probe technique on unstructured samples .",
    "@xmath34 was taken at the 50% of the transition curves .    in fig .",
    "[ rt ] are reported the @xmath36 transition curves of nb thin films of different thickness grown on the porous substrates si10 , namely samples si10-nb8.5 and si10-nb12 , and si40 , namely sample si40-nb8.5 .",
    "it can be observed that the critical temperature , @xmath2 , decreases as the thickness of the nb film is reduced , as expected @xcite .",
    "the same @xmath2(@xmath28 ) dependence is obtained for samples sets deposited on different porous templates . in the same figure the resistive transitions of non - porous reference nb films are also shown .",
    "the critical temperatures of these samples are higher than the @xmath2 of the film with the same thickness deposited on the porous substrates .",
    "this difference is less evident for the sample with the larger interpore distance , since the ratio between the non - porous and the porous area is higher in this case so that the critical temperature results less depressed",
    ". this @xmath2 reduction could be related , for example , to the highly reactive internal porous surface area @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ rt ] it also emerges that the @xmath2 difference between porous and non - porous samples is reduced as the nb thickness is increased due to the fact that , for larger @xmath28 , the pores are mostly covered and their effect on the electronic transport properties is less important .",
    "the data show also that the @xmath36 shapes are strongly effected by the pores and the interpore distances dimensions . in fact , while sample si40-nb8.5 shows a rather sharp @xmath36 curve , sample si10-nb8.5 presents a broad double step transition .",
    "this difference , at these reduced nb thickness and substrate parameters , can be ascribed to the formation of a superconducting wire network made of several thin nb stripes of different width , and hence to the distribution of transition temperatures for the stripes in the entire sample @xcite .",
    "the ( h , t ) phase diagrams for our samples were obtained performing @xmath36 measurements at fixed magnetic fields and @xmath37 measurements at fixed temperatures . in general , the perpendicular upper critical field of superconducting films of thickness _",
    "d _ obeys to a linear temperature dependence ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the parallel ginzburg - landau coherence length at t = 0 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath40 is @xmath40 = @xmath39/@xmath41 .",
    "since the film dimensions in the _ xy _ plane are larger than @xmath40 , the expression ( [ eq : hc2 ] ) is verified in the whole temperature range .    before presenting the results obtained for the nb films deposited on ps",
    ", it is worth to show the @xmath0 curves for two nb reference films , as reported in fig .",
    "[ ht - nps ] .",
    "as expected the @xmath0 behavior is linear for both the samples .",
    "a fit of the data with the expression ( [ eq : hc2 ] ) , yields a value of the ginzburg - landau coherence length at t = 0 , @xmath42 nm for @xmath43 nm and @xmath44 nm for @xmath45 nm . thus the pore diameter dimensions in our ps substrates are comparable with the vortex core dimensions at t=0 , @xmath46 .",
    "this means that each pore can trap only one fluxon , the saturation number being @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "subsequently multiquanta vortex lattice @xcite can not be observed in our systems , which are then suitable for the study of commensurability effect at low temperatures and high magnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath0 curves obtained for the nb films deposited on porous si templates present some peculiarities .",
    "[ ht - ps1](a ) shows the phase diagram , @xmath0 , of two samples of different thickness grown on the porous si substrate with @xmath20 nm and @xmath19 nm , namely si10-nb8.5 and si10-nb12 . similarly , fig .",
    "[ ht - ps1](b ) shows @xmath0 dependence of two samples of different thickness grown on the porous si substrate with @xmath48 nm and @xmath21 nm , namely si20-nb12 and si20-nb15 . in both cases",
    "it is clearly visible that the introduction of the porous array modifies the upper critical field behavior of the nb thin film .",
    "@xmath0 is characterized , in fact , by a strong non linear temperature dependence near @xmath2 , which becomes less evident when the nb thickness exceeds @xmath12 . in the sample si10-nb12 , where the condition @xmath45 nm @xmath49 nm is realized",
    ", the upper critical magnetic field is linear in all the temperature range , as shown by the linear fit in fig .",
    "[ ht - ps1](a ) .",
    "the comparison between two nb thin films of the same thickness deposited on si20 and a non - porous substrate is reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ ht - ps1](b ) .",
    "apart from a @xmath2 reduction the porous nb film is again characterized by a non linear @xmath0 dependence . however , for these samples the positive curvature of @xmath0 close to @xmath2 is the only effect we could notice since the extremely small interpore spacing of these two analyzed substrates ( si10 , si20 ) would produce commensurability effects only at very large magnetic fields , namely 24 and 6 tesla , respectively .",
    "these fields values are not accessible to our experimental set up . on the other hand the matching field",
    "should be considerably smaller if nb films are deposited on a ps substrate with a larger interpore distance .",
    "for example , for the porous si template si40 , @xmath50 tesla , a reachable value for our experimental set up . for this reason , to study commensurability effects ,",
    "two films of different thickness were deposited on this substrate , namely samples si40-nb8.5 and si40-nb12 . moreover , in order to investigate a film with an intermediate nb thickness , the sample si40-nb12 was deliberately oxidized obtaining the formation of about 2 nm thick oxide layer .",
    "this sample , with a resulting suppressed superconducting critical temperature , was named si40-nb10 .",
    "the @xmath36 transitions measured for different values of the magnetic fields from 0 to 2 tesla are presented in the inset of fig .",
    "[ ht - ps2](a ) for the sample si40-nb10 .",
    "the resulting ( h , t ) phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ ht - ps2](a ) .",
    "similarly , in fig . [ ht - ps2](b ) the @xmath0 dependence is shown for the sample si40-nb12 .",
    "the upper critical fields are again characterized by a non linear temperature dependence near @xmath2 .    moreover , it is also interesting to note that for these samples the @xmath0 dependencies present first a positive curvature followed by a change in the concavity , which occurs in both cases at @xmath16 tesla .",
    "this effect is more evident if we plot the @xmath51 second derivative versus temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ ht - ps2](a),(b ) , right scale . in both cases @xmath52/@xmath53 shows , in fact ,",
    "an abrupt change at @xmath1 tesla , where the anomaly in the @xmath0 dependence is present .",
    "similar features in ( h , t ) phase diagram were reported for nb thin films deposited on al@xmath8o@xmath9 substrates @xcite , as well as on triangular array produced by micellar technique @xcite .",
    "another peculiarity that can be ascribed to the reduced dimensionality of these samples is observed plotting the @xmath36 transition width , @xmath54 = @xmath2(@xmath55 = @xmath56 @xmath57)@xmath58(@xmath55 = @xmath59 @xmath57 ) , as a function of the field . the @xmath54 dependence , reported in inset of fig . [ ht - ps2](b ) for the sample si40-nb12 shows , in fact , a minimum again at @xmath16 tesla .",
    "this feature is in general expected at the matching field , since dissipative effects are reduced as commensurability occurs , resulting in shaper resistive transitions .",
    "both anomalies of the @xmath0 and the @xmath15 behaviors at @xmath1 tesla , make us confident to identify this field as the first matching field , @xmath6 .",
    "then , it follows that the period of the porous template is _ a _ = 48 nm , a value in very good agreement with the nominal interpore spacing of this analyzed sample , @xmath29 nm .",
    "the non - monotonic @xmath15 behavior is also reminiscent of the formation of a superconducting wire network . in this case",
    "the observed oscillations could be a direct consequence of fluxoid quantization in a multiply connected superconductor , an extension of little - parks oscillations of an individual superconducting loops @xcite .",
    "the expected amplitude of the @xmath54 oscillations can be estimated by the expression @xmath60^{2}$ ] @xcite , which in our case , for _ a _ = 48 nm , gives @xmath61 mk , a value close to the one experimentally observed , namely @xmath62 mk .",
    "a fit of the data close to @xmath2 with the expression ( [ eq : hc2 ] ) , yields a value of the ginzburg - landau coherence length at t = 0 , @xmath63 nm and @xmath44 nm , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath39 are significantly smaller than the bcs coherence length of nb , @xmath64 nm @xcite , indicating that our films are in dirty limit regime with an electron mean free path of @xmath65 = 1.38 @xmath66 / @xmath67 @xmath68 nm @xcite .",
    "the ginzburg - landau parameter , @xmath69 = @xmath70(0)/@xmath39 , can be estimated using the expression @xmath69 = 0.72@xmath71/@xmath65 @xmath72 , where @xmath73 nm is the london penetration depth of nb @xcite",
    ". ratios of @xmath39/@xmath74 and @xmath70(0)/@xmath75 , measured for _ a _ = 48 nm , are larger than in previous works @xcite on perforated nb samples , indicating that we are in presence of individual vortex pinning @xcite .",
    "therefore the porous template can overcome the lattice rigidity , being suitable for the vortex lattice pinning in nb thin films .",
    "critical temperatures and perpendicular upper critical fields measurements were performed on nb thin films sputtered on different ps substrates obtained by electrochemical etching of si in a hf solution .",
    "the control of the etching parameter allows to obtain templates with pores diameter and interpore distance tunable in the range @xmath76 nm and @xmath77 nm , respectively .",
    "these templates were used as a system of pinning arrays in order to obtain the formation of commensurate vortex structures at high matching fields down to low temperatures .",
    "anomalies in the @xmath0 behavior , as well as in the field dependence of the @xmath36 width , were in fact observed at @xmath1 tesla , which was estimated as the first matching field , @xmath6 .",
    "these preliminary results are promising , specially considering that ps prepared by traditional electrochemical etching exhibits a sponge structure , so that the holes are not a regularly distributed ordered planar pinning structure .",
    "future work will focus on critical currents density studies , carried out both by transport measurements on patterned samples and by magnetization measurements .",
    "moreover , due to the extreme reduced features size of ps templates , these systems look appealing also for the studying of two dimensional superconducting wire networks",
