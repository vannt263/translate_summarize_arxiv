    "the x  ray emission from seyfert host galaxies is essentially composed by the contribution of a number of discrete sources and the hot interstellar plasma ( fabbiano 1989 ) .",
    "most of the discrete sources appear to be close accreting binaries , with a compact companion . _",
    "einstein _ observations of the bulge of m31 showed a population of about 100 low mass x ",
    "ray binaries lmxrb ( fabbiano et al . 1987 ) . later on , supper et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed , by using _",
    "rosat _ data , that the most luminous of these objects has @xmath1 erg / s , close to the eddington limit for a @xmath2 neutron star .",
    "recently , several sources with x  ray luminosity quite higher than the eddington limit for a neutron star have been detected in nearby galaxies ( e.g. read et al .",
    "1997 , makishima et al .",
    "2000 , zezas et al .",
    "the highest luminosity value is about @xmath3 erg / s .",
    "fabbiano et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found with _",
    "chandra _ 14 pointlike sources in the antennae galaxies , with luminosities above @xmath4 erg / s and up to @xmath5 erg / s",
    ".    this discovery has raised difficulties to interpret these sources . even though it is statistically possible to have _ some _ individual cases of off  centre black holes with masses of the order of @xmath6 @xmath7 ( by assuming a typical eddington ratio of @xmath8 ; cf .",
    "nowak 1995 ) , it is very difficult to explain the high number of sources detected so far within this scenario .",
    "several other hypotheses have been suggested about the nature of ulx : anisotropic emission from accreting black holes ( king et al . 2001 ) , emission from jets in microblazar ( krding et al .",
    "2002 ) , emission from accreting kerr black holes ( makishima et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , the lack of sufficient spectral information did not allow to date to distinguish among the different models proposed .    here",
    "we present early results of the analysis of six of the most luminous galactic serendipitous sources detected with _",
    "xmm  newton _ during a survey of a distance  limited ( @xmath0 mpc ) sample of seyfert galaxies ( di cocco et al .",

    "br : thermal bremsstrahlung ; cst : unsaturated comptonization ; mcd : multicolor accretion disk .",
    "intrinsic absorption of the source , in addition to the galactic @xmath9 .",
    "for the first four sources in table  [ tab : sorg2 ] provides the best fit with a simple power law with @xmath10 ( for an example of spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "the two remaining cases are best fitted with a black body model , with @xmath11  kev ( for an example see fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "it is known that the emission expected from a black hole x  ray binary ( bhxrb ) is variable : in the hard state , the spectrum is typically a power law with @xmath12 , while in the soft state the spectral index increases up to about 2.5 and a soft component appears in the x  ray spectrum ( e.g. ebisawa et al . 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , given the actual statistics , our sources could be bhxrb in a hard / soft state . the exposures are too short to perform meaningful time variability studies .",
    "this is unfortunate because variability could help to distinguish xrb from , e.g. , young x  ray supernovae remnants .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mcd model , which has often been successfull in the past for ulx ( e.g. colbert & mushotzky 1999 , makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) , does not fit well most of our sources . even when we obtain a reasonable fit with mcd ( for the last two sources in table  [ tab : sorg2 ] ) ,",
    "statistics give a better fit with a simple black body model .",
    "the unsaturated comptonization ( cst ) does not give acceptable fits , except for xmm j123617.5 + 285855 , for which it represents the second best fit , after the power law ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "the luminosities observed are in the range @xmath14 erg / s , depending on the model considered . under the assumption of uniform and isotropic accretion , a bolometric luminosity approximately equal to the x  ray luminosity , and an eddington ratio of @xmath15",
    ", these values suggest the presence of compact objects with masses between @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath7 .",
    "if the eddington ratio is in the range of about @xmath8 , as suggested by observations of galactic black holes ( e.g. nowak 1995 ) , this would imply a mass range of @xmath18 @xmath7 .",
    "such high masses are difficult to explain for off  centre sources and several authors have proposed alternatives to the above scenario .",
    "for example , makishima et al . ( 2000 ) proposed a kerr bh scenario : in this case , the luminosity produced by a spinning bh can be up to 7 times larger than in a schwarzschild bh . on the other hand , king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that the matter could accrete anisotropically : an anisotropic factor of @xmath8 reduces the values of the mass to those typically observed in x  ray binaries in the milky way .",
    "finally , krding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested the possibility of relativistic beaming due to the presence of jets coupled to an accretion disk .",
    "with respect to this scenario , it is worth noting that mirabel & rodriguez ( 1999 ) found that the speed of the relativistic jet has a bimodal distribution . for an accreting neutron star @xmath19 , lower that the value related to the case of an accreting black hole ( @xmath20 ) . in this scenario , if the angle between the line of sight and the axis of ejection is very small ( less than @xmath21 ) , the flux density is boosted up to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the lorentz factor ) with respect to its value in the rest frame . with the speed values cited above , the flux boosting for an accreting neutron star",
    "could be increased by about 10 times , while it could be even 100 times if a black hole is present ( cf .",
    "georganopoulos et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we present preliminary results from the analysis of the brightest sources detected in a sample of four nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "statistics are sufficient to perform a spectral fitting with simple models .",
    "what is emerging from this preliminary analysis is that their spectral properties , given the present statistics , are best consistent with models typical of accreting bh binaries in a hard / soft state .",
    "but the luminosities observed probably require some anisotropy or beaming in the emission .",
    "observations with higher exposures and at other wavelengths ( particularly optical and radio ) are required to put tighter constraints on the nature of these enigmatic objects .",
