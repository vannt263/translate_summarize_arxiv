    "there has been assembled a sequence of technologies by which one might eventually compute hadronic form factors directly from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "these include the early work by drell and yan @xcite and by brodsky and drell @xcite on the relation of form factors to fock - state wave functions in light - cone quantization .",
    "the wave functions can be calculated , in principle , by the method of discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) proposed by pauli and brodsky @xcite .",
    "refinements of dlcq that permit substantive calculations in non - super - renormalizable , ( 3 + 1)-dimensional field theories have now been tested by brodsky , hiller , and mccartor @xcite ; a key role is played by pauli ",
    "villars ( pv ) regularization @xcite , implemented through the introduction of pv bosons to the dlcq fock - state basis . in the following sections , a description is given of how this sequence comes together , and the steps are applied to a form factor calculation in the model of ref .",
    "formal expressions for the dirac and pauli form factors @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a composite fermion can be obtained @xcite by considering the current matrix elements @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the plus component of the current , @xmath4 is the light - cone longitudinal momentum of the initial state of mass @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the photon momentum , and @xmath7 is the spin projection along the @xmath8 axis . by working in light - cone coordinates @xcite and in the drell - yan frame @xcite , with @xmath9 , the form factors can be expressed directly in terms of fock - sector wave functions @xmath10 as @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the number of constituents ; @xmath13 is the charge of the struck constituent ; the @xmath14 are longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath15 for constituents with momenta @xmath16 ; the @xmath17 are relative transverse momenta ; and @xmath18 are transverse momenta relative to the new @xmath19 direction .",
    "thus , given the wave functions @xmath10 one can compute the form factors .    in light - cone quantization",
    "these wave functions can be found by diagonalizing the mass - squared operator @xmath20 , traditionally called the light - cone hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this is simplest in a frame where the total transverse momentum is zero and in a basis where @xmath21 is diagonal .",
    "then only the light - cone energy operator @xmath22 has a nontrivial representation , and the eigenstate can be expanded explicitly in terms of momentum fock states @xmath23 and the desired wave functions : @xmath24 it is a significant advantage of light - cone coordinates that such an expansion is well - defined , in the sense that there are no contributions from disconnected vacuum pieces @xcite .",
    "another advantage is that the boost invariance of @xmath25 and @xmath26 permit the same wave functions to be used in the construction of the boosted state @xmath27 .",
    "the wave functions can be computed by applying dlcq @xcite to the eigenvalue problem @xmath28 .",
    "pauli and brodsky applied this method to ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models for its initial trials @xcite .",
    "since then much work has been done @xcite , particularly in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the greater complexity of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional theories has made progress there much slower .",
    "the need for regularization and nonperturbative renormalization has been most telling @xcite .",
    "recently a scheme for use of pauli  villars ( pv ) ultraviolet regularization @xcite within dlcq calculations has been successfully tested for ( 3 + 1)-dimensional model hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "massive pv bosons are introduced as additional constituents in the fock basis , with imaginary couplings chosen to produce desired cancellations in perturbation theory .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is solved nonperturbatively , and the limit of infinite pv mass is taken .",
