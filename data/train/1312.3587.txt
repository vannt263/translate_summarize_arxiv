    "in 1953 , sherr and gerhart published a paper @xcite on  experimental evidence for the fermi interaction in the @xmath2 decay of @xmath3o and @xmath4c .",
    "\" it was less than five years since sherr had first discovered these two nuclei @xcite , yet already the two authors were using the decays to probe for the first time the fundamental nature of @xmath2 decay . they were able to identify superallowed transitions in both decays  they called them  allowed favoured transitions \"  and recognized that the fermi theory of @xmath2 decay predicted that the comparative half - lives , or @xmath5 values , for the two transitions should be the same , a prediction they could test .",
    "the @xmath5 value for a transition depends on the energy released by the transition as well as its branching ratio and the half - life of the initial state . using degraders to determine the energy of the emitted positrons , a nai(tl ) scintillation spectrometer to establish the branching ratios and geiger counters to measure the half lives , sherr and gerhard were able to conclude that the two @xmath5 values were indeed the same , albeit with large error bars : they obtained 3300@xmath6750 s for the superallowed @xmath5 value of @xmath3o and 5900@xmath62400 s for that of @xmath4c .    by 1960 , when bardin _",
    "et al . _  reported a much improved result for @xmath3o @xcite , experimental techniques had advanced considerably .",
    "the decay energy was no longer dependent on positron range measurements , but rather on measured q values for the reactions @xmath7c(@xmath8he,@xmath9)@xmath3o and @xmath7c(@xmath8he,@xmath10)@xmath3n * , which populated the superallowed transition s parent and daughter states , respectively , from a common target .",
    "also , the branching ratio could be corrected for the weak non - superallowed @xmath2 branch to the ground state of @xmath3n , which had by then been measured with the help of a magnetic lens spectrometer @xcite .",
    "they reported an @xmath5 value of 3060@xmath613 s , which for its time is a remarkably precise result and stands only 1.4 standard deviations away from the currently accepted value of 3042.3@xmath62.7 s.    the precision obtained by bardin _",
    "et al . _",
    "was sufficient for them to compare the vector coupling constant @xmath11 , derived from their @xmath5-value , with @xmath12 , the weak - interaction constant derived from the purely leptonic decay of the muon .",
    "the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis had been proposed by feynman and gell - mann two years earlier @xcite but the role of strangeness was not yet understood , so the authors expected that @xmath11 should equal @xmath12 .",
    "although their measurement actually showed a small difference between the two , the authors noted that radiative and coulomb corrections could account for the discrepancy and concluded that it was too soon to tell if this constituted a failure of the universality hypothesis .",
    "the discrepancy persisted , however , and was joined by other discrepancies observed between weak decays that changed strangeness @xmath13 and those that did not , the most glaring example being the decays of the @xmath14 ( @xmath13=1 ) and the @xmath15 ( @xmath13=0 ) mesons to the same final state , @xmath16 + @xmath17 .",
    "all these apparent conflicts with vector - current universality were resolved by cabibbo in 1963 @xcite when he recognized that the universality of the weak interaction was manifest only if one considered the total strength of both the strangeness non - changing and the strangeness changing decays . in modern terminology",
    "we would say that he was the first to realize that there is mixing between the first two generations of quarks , and to express that mixing in terms of a unitary rotation .",
    "as it turned out , that was only part of the story . a year after cabibbo introduced his rotation angle , another symmetry  that of cp  was observed to be violated in the weak decay of the long - lived neutral kaon .",
    "this result , which remained a puzzle for nearly a decade , ultimately led kobayashi and maskawa @xcite in 1973 to postulate the existence of a third generation of quarks  subsequently confirmed by experiment  and to replace cabibbo s single rotation angle @xmath18 , which was in effect a 2@xmath192 rotation matrix , by the now familiar 3@xmath193 unitary rotation matrix referred to as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa , or ckm , matrix .",
    "it became one of the pillars of the standard model .",
    "in the conclusion to his 1963 paper , cabibbo remarked that @xmath11 should no longer be expected to be equal to @xmath12 but rather to @xmath12cos@xmath18 .",
    "however , he noted that although this change was  in the right direction to eliminate the discrepancy between @xmath3o and muon lifetimes , \" in fact the correction was  too large , leaving about 2% to be explained \" @xcite .",
    "that observation was enough to stimulate a great deal of activity in superallowed @xmath2 decay during the decade between cabibbo s insight and that of kobayashi and maskawa . by 1973 ,",
    "the number of well - measured superallowed transitions had grown from one to seven ; the 2% discrepancy was being explained in terms of radiative corrections and charge - dependent nuclear corrections @xcite ; and plausible values for the cabibbo angle had been extracted from the results . once the ckm matrix took center stage though , it was not long before the focus of superallowed @xmath2 decay had shifted to a determination of the upper left element of the ckm matrix , @xmath20 , the value of which is in fact closely related to @xmath21 .    today , 40 years on",
    ", although the standard model is by now well established , the limits of its applicability are still being probed aggressively .",
    "one such experimental probe is to test the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "although the standard model does not prescribe values for the nine elements of the matrix ",
    "they must all be determined from experiment  it does require the matrix itself to be unitary",
    ". superallowed @xmath2 decay is currently the source of the most precise value for @xmath20 @xcite , which is the largest element in the matrix , and is therefore a crucial contributor to the most sensitive available test of ckm unitarity : the sum of squares of the three top - row elements @xcite .",
    "the current value for that unitarity sum is 1.00008@xmath60.00056 @xcite , a remarkably precise result that agrees with unitarity and significantly limits the scope for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "however , even this precision , @xmath60.06% , will likely be improved before long by upgraded measurements of superallowed transitions , which are already underway .    in what follows we review",
    "particularly the experimental methods that have been , and are being , used to characterize superallowed @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 transitions .",
    "although these are all nuclear - physics measurements , the extraordinary demands for precision in the standard - model test have motivated the development of highly refined techniques not commonly employed in other nuclear - physics applications .",
    "in addition , since theory also plays a vital role in the extraction of @xmath20 , we also outline the methods used for calculating the small radiative and isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections that must be applied to the experimental data .",
    "since the axial current can not contribute to transitions between spin-0 states , superallowed @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2 decay between @xmath22=1 analogue states depends uniquely on the vector part of the weak interaction .",
    "as already noted , the cvc principle indicates that the experimental @xmath5 value for such a transition should be related to the vector coupling constant , @xmath11 , which must be common to all nuclear vector transitions . in turn , @xmath11 itself is related to the fundamental weak - interaction coupling constant , @xmath12 , via the relation = v_ud , [ gvtovud ] where @xmath23 gev@xmath24 , as obtained from the measured muon lifetime @xcite    in practice , the expression for @xmath5 includes several small correction terms .",
    "it is convenient to combine some of these terms with the @xmath5 value and define a  corrected \" @xmath25 value .",
    "thus , we write @xcite t ft ( 1 +",
    "_ r^ ) ( 1 + _ ns - _ c ) =  , [ ftconst ] where @xmath26 gev@xmath27s , @xmath28 is the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction , and @xmath29 is the transition - independent part of the radiative correction .",
    "the terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 comprise the transition - dependent part of the radiative correction , the former being a function only of the electron s energy and the @xmath32 of the daughter nucleus , while the latter , like @xmath28 , depends in its evaluation on the details of the nuclear structure of the parent and daughter states .",
    "all these correction terms are of order 1% or less , with uncertainties at least an order of magnitude smaller than that , so equation  ( [ ftconst ] ) provides an experimental method for determining @xmath11  and thus @xmath20  to better than a part in a thousand .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath5 value that characterizes a superallowed transition  or any @xmath2 transition for that matter  is determined from three measured quantities : the total transition energy , @xmath33 , the half - life , @xmath34 , of the parent state , and the branching ratio , @xmath35 , for the particular transition of interest .",
    "the @xmath33-value is required to determine the phase - space integral , @xmath36 , while the half - life and branching ratio combine to yield the partial half - life , @xmath37 . since the @xmath5 value incorporates three experimental quantities , each one of those quantities",
    "must be measured to substantially better than 0.1% precision in order to achieve that precision on the combination .",
    "this is particularly true for @xmath33 since it enters to the fifth power in the calculation of @xmath36 .",

    "@xmath4c , @xmath40 mg and @xmath41ar  are known to @xmath500.3% .",
    "the 13 cases are shown on the chart of nuclides in fig.[fig : chart ] . how has this level of precision been achieved in all these cases for the combination of three experimental quantities ? in answering this question in the following sections , we frequently reference examples of various measurement techniques .",
    "a complete referenced list of _ all _ measurements that currently contribute to world data for superallowed @xmath0@xmath1 decays appears in the 2009 survey by hardy and towner @xcite .",
    "already in 1960 ,",
    "barden _ et al . _",
    "@xcite appreciated that a determination of the end - point energy from a measured @xmath2 spectrum , even if that spectrum were obtained with a magnetic spectrometer , could not possibly match the precision possible with a nuclear reaction . from that time on , until the advent of on - line penning traps less than a decade ago , nuclear reactions were the only method used to determine precise @xmath33 values .",
    "the favoured ones were ( @xmath51 ) and ( @xmath8he,@xmath37 ) reactions on the @xmath2-decay daughter nuclei , which are stable for all @xmath0@xmath1 superallowed decays that have been studied until recently .",
    "since these reactions connect the same nuclei as the corresponding @xmath2 decay , their @xmath52 values are directly related to the @xmath2-decay @xmath33 value .    the relative precision , @xmath53 , for @xmath33-value measurements of superallowed transitions is plotted against their publication date , where @xmath52 is the measured @xmath33 value and @xmath54 is its quoted uncertainty .",
    "the data encompass the superallowed transitions from @xmath4c , @xmath3o , @xmath42al , @xmath41cl , @xmath43k , @xmath44sc , @xmath45v , @xmath46mn and @xmath47co , and are taken from a series of survey articles @xcite plus two more - recent publications @xcite .",
    "each point is identified by the experimental method used in the corresponding measurement .",
    "the line simply illustrates the decreasing trend .",
    "( adapted from ref.@xcite.),width=491 ]    the relative precision , @xmath53 , obtained for various measurements and techniques is plotted in fig.[fig : history ] as a function of publication date , starting in 1960 .",
    "evidently the relative precision improved steadily over the years , from @xmath555@xmath19@xmath56 in the early 1960s to @xmath553@xmath19@xmath57 by 1990 , but at that point a limit seemed to have been reached : for the next fifteen years there were no further improvements in @xmath33-value precision , not even with the appearance of the first few penning - trap measurements .",
    "however , the figure shows that in the space of only a few years after their first contribution , penning traps had improved the relative precision for measured @xmath33 values by a factor of 5 , to as low as @xmath557@xmath19@xmath58 . to put this last number into perspective",
    ", it applies to the decay of @xmath43k and corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath640 ev on a total @xmath33 value of 6044.22 kev @xcite .    although penning traps are now outstripping nuclear reactions in the precision of their @xmath33-value results , for each transition it is the average of all measurements with uncertainties within a factor of ten of the best measurement that is used in the determination of @xmath20 .",
    "many reaction measurements therefore still make significant contributions to the world averages for @xmath33 values .",
    "we will describe several examples of important reaction measurements before doing the same for penning - trap measurements .",
    "it can easily be seen in fig.[fig : history ] that before 2005 the dominant choice for making @xmath33-value measurements of @xmath0@xmath1 transitions was the ( @xmath10,@xmath9 ) reaction .",
    "there are a total of 21 such cases documented in the figure , with all but one  the first  being threshold measurements . between 1962 and 1976 ,",
    "all but two of the measurements were made by freeman and her collaborators using the 12 mev tandem accelerator at harwell in england ( e.g.  @xcite ) . from 1977 on ,",
    "all but two were made by barker _",
    "et al . _",
    "using the folded tandem accelerator aura2 at the university of auckland in new zealand ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the freeman measurements and the early barker measurements all used the same general approach : for a superallowed decay p@xmath59d they bombarded a thin target of the daughter material d with a proton beam for a well - determined time , and then interrupted the beam while they determined the amount of the parent p that had been produced by recording the characteristic activity of p , usually its emitted positrons .",
    "this beam on - off cycle was repeated until sufficient statistics had been accumulated",
    ". then the process was repeated at a succession of different beam energies until a threshold curve for the production of p had been obtained .",
    "they calibrated the proton beam energy near threshold by scattering the beam at 90@xmath60 from a thin gold foil into a broad - range magnetic spectrograph , where it was compared with a known @xmath61-particle group from the decay of a standard source such as @xmath62po .",
    "this , of course , meant that the accuracy of their threshold energy  and the resultant @xmath33 value  relied upon the accuracy of the @xmath61-particle energy as it was known at the time but , by clearly indicating the @xmath61 energy they used , they ensured that their result could be upgraded in future whenever that calibration energy was improved .",
    "barker s group refined this technique by passing the primary proton beam through an enge split - pole magnetic spectrograph , which was set at 0@xmath60 .",
    "the beam path and width were constrained by a set of slots and apertures , resulting in an energy profile with fwhm ( full width half maximum ) of 50 - 100 ppm ( parts per million ) at the focal plane of the spectrograph @xcite .",
    "it was this prepared beam that bombarded the target , which was located 50 cm beyond the focal plane . to determine the energy of the proton beam , the magnetic rigidity of the spectrograph orbit was calibrated by leaving the field strength unchanged and passing a monoenergetic heavy - ion beam of cesium or potassium around the same constrained orbit .",
    "that heavy - ion beam was produced by surface ionization and then accelerated through a potential @xmath63 , which was adjusted until the ions were observed just upstream from the target . finally , the optimized voltage @xmath63 was compared with a 1-volt standard via two successive stages of resistive division .",
    "the threshold determined from a yield curve was thus based firmly on a primary calibration standard ",
    "the volt  independent of any secondary reaction @xmath52 values .",
    "however it did require corrections for finite energy spread of the beam , for non - uniform proton energy loss and for atomic excitation .",
    "it was also subject to near - threshold resonances , which , if present , could misguide the analysis @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at its apotheosis , this technique achieved a precision of @xmath552@xmath19@xmath57 on several measured @xmath33 values .",
    "a second reaction - based approach that ultimately led to very precise results was to measure both ( @xmath10,@xmath64 ) and ( @xmath9,@xmath64 ) reactions on a common target , which had been chosen so that the ( @xmath10,@xmath64 ) reaction would produce the parent of a @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2 decay , and the ( @xmath9,@xmath64 ) reaction would produce the daughter : for example , @xmath65mg(@xmath10,@xmath64)@xmath42al and @xmath65mg(@xmath9,@xmath64)@xmath66 mg @xcite .",
    "in such cases , the reaction @xmath52 values yield @xmath33 through the relation q_ec = q_n - q_p - 782.347  kev , [ qpgpn ] which is independent of the mass of the target nucleus .    continuing with the same example @xcite , the @xmath65mg(@xmath9,@xmath64)@xmath66 mg reaction was studied with thermal neutrons from the los alamos omega west reactor .",
    "gamma rays were detected with a compton - suppressed ge(li ) detector , and their energies precisely determined from a calibration based on well known lines observed in the @xmath67h(@xmath9,@xmath64 ) , @xmath7c(@xmath9,@xmath64 ) and @xmath3n(@xmath9,@xmath64 ) reactions .",
    "the value of @xmath68 was then obtained from the average summed energy of a number of @xmath64-ray cascades de - exciting the capture state in @xmath66 mg . for the @xmath65mg(@xmath10,@xmath64)@xmath42al reaction a dual mg - al target ( upper",
    "half mg , lower half al ) was employed , over which a proton beam from the utrecht 3 mv van der graaff accelerator was wobbled up and down .",
    "the proton energies at four @xmath65mg(@xmath10,@xmath64)@xmath42al resonances were compared with four accurately known resonances in the @xmath69al(@xmath10,@xmath64)@xmath70si reaction . the proton beam was scanned in 200-ev steps over each @xmath65 mg resonance and its nearest neighbour @xmath69al resonance , which in all four cases was only a few kev away .",
    "thus each of the proton energy differences could be determined precisely and an average @xmath71-value obtained .",
    "obviously this method for determining @xmath33 depended on secondary calibration standards but it was less dependent on experimental corrections than was the ( @xmath10,@xmath9 ) reaction described in sec .",
    "[ pnreact ] . at its best",
    ", it achieved a relative precision of 3 - 5@xmath19@xmath57 .",
    "like ( @xmath10,@xmath9 ) , a ( @xmath8he,@xmath37 ) reaction acting on the daughter of a superallowed @xmath0@xmath1 decay produces the parent of the decay , so the reaction @xmath52 value is directly related to @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast with ( @xmath10,@xmath9 ) though , the energy of the outgoing particle  a tritium ion  can be measured conveniently .",
    "even so , to determine the @xmath52 value , the energies of both the tritons and the @xmath8he projectiles must still be calibrated at high precision against an established energy standard , not an easy task at the energies involved .",
    "koslowsky , hardy and collaborators at chalk river dealt with this difficulty by developing a novel system that allowed them to measure the @xmath52-_value differences _ between two ( @xmath8he,@xmath37 ) reactions produced concurrently from a target containing two components , each the daughter of a superallowed @xmath2 emitter @xcite .    schematic diagram illustrating the principle of biasing a two - component target in order to peak - match the reaction - product group @xmath73 from one component with group @xmath74 from the other component .",
    "( adapted from ref.@xcite.),width=415 ]    their method is illustrated in fig.[fig : doublet ] .",
    "a two - component target was bombarded by a doubly ionized @xmath8he beam of 20 - 30 mev from an mp tandem accelerator .",
    "the ejected tritons were analyzed at 0@xmath60 by a high - resolution q3d magnetic spectrometer , which transformed their energy spectrum into a distribution in position along its focal plane .",
    "the target assembly was constructed so that it could be intermittently biased at @xmath75 volts relative to its grounded surroundings , with @xmath63 being adjustable up to 150 kv . with the target at voltage @xmath75 , the @xmath8he beam , being doubly ionized ,",
    "was retarded by 2@xmath63 ev , while the singly - charged tritons were re - accelerated by only @xmath63 ev . as a result , the net effect of the imposed voltage was to reduce the triton energy by @xmath63 ev relative to its value with no voltage on the target , thus shifting its position on the focal plane .",
    "the target voltage could then be adjusted until the shifted position of triton group @xmath74 exactly coincided with the unshifted position of @xmath73 ( see fig.[fig : doublet ] ) . that adjusted voltage , which was related by resistive division to the standard volt , corresponded to the energy difference between groups @xmath73 and @xmath74 . furthermore , since the shifted tritons ( @xmath74 ) followed the same path as the unshifted ones ( @xmath73 ) , the result was independent of that path . with @xmath73",
    "chosen to be a triton group from one target component and @xmath74 being from the other , the difference between reaction @xmath52 values could be precisely determined with reference to the standard volt .    of course , the superallowed @xmath33-value differences themselves were not 150 kev or less . in practice , for each doublet , the experimental team determined the @xmath52-value difference for the population of an excited state in each of the two @xmath2-decay parents , these states being chosen so that their @xmath52-value difference was indeed within 150 kev .",
    "their excitation energies were either known or determined separately via @xmath64-ray spectroscopy , so the measured reaction @xmath52-value differences could be related quite precisely to the superallowed @xmath33-value differences .",
    "four pairs of superallowed decay energies were studied in this way @xcite .",
    "being differences , the results do not appear in fig.[fig : history ] , but their precision was comparable to the best reaction results that do appear there , and they continue to figure prominently in the world averages for @xmath33 values @xcite .      the @xmath33 value for @xmath2 decay is simply the atomic mass difference between the parent state and its daughter : it could be derived from those masses if they were known precisely enough .",
    "so far , though , we have just described methods for measuring the difference directly since , until recently , this approach yielded the only precise results .",
    "as explanation , consider the superallowed @xmath0@xmath1 decay , @xmath42al@xmath59@xmath66 mg .",
    "the masses of the nuclear states in this case are @xmath55@xmath76 ev and the difference between them ( @xmath33 ) is @xmath55@xmath77 ev .",
    "reaction measurements yield @xmath33-values with relative precision of @xmath55@xmath78 ( see fig.[fig : history ] ) , which is @xmath55120 ev in this case . to achieve the same precision with a pair of mass measurements would require them each to have a relative precision of @xmath55@xmath79 .",
    "this was beyond the capability of conventional mass spectrometry , which in any case was limited to effectively stable nuclei .",
    "the balance has shifted with the appearance of penning traps coupled on - line to an accelerator .",
    "the penning trap itself can confine charged particles to a small volume by means of static magnetic and electric fields , the former being homogeneous and the latter quadrupolar .",
    "the trapped ions exhibit three eigenmotions : one along the axis of the magnetic field , and the other two in the radial plane perpendicular to that axis . by combining the frequencies of these three eigenmotions ,",
    "one can obtain the cyclotron frequency , @xmath80 , of the trapped ions and , from it , the mass of the ion itself since _",
    "c = , [ cycf ] where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the charge and mass of the ion , and @xmath83 is the magnetic field . for stable nuclei , the frequency can be determined via external circuitry , without the trapped ions being released @xcite .",

    "this requires a number of additional steps in the experimental procedures .",
    "first the ions of interest must be produced by an accelerator ; next they are cooled , bunched and if necessary purified ; and then they are injected into the penning trap . because of the short half - life of the ions , this cycle is repeated continuously with fresh ion bunches being delivered every few seconds . in each cycle , once the ions are trapped , the cyclotron frequency in the trap is probed with an applied radiofrequency electric field , after which the ions are released and their time of flight measured to a microchannel - plate detector located outside the high - field region . as the applied frequency is scanned through the cyclotron frequency , the ions time - of - flight passes through a distinct minimum , as is shown in fig.[fig : penning ] . to this basic technique",
    "numerous refinements have been applied , the most significant of which is to excite the ion motion with ramsey s method of time - separated oscillatory fields @xcite .    on - line penning trap measurements for superallowed @xmath2 decay have been , and are being performed at four different facilities : isoltrap ( _ e.g. _  ref.@xcite ) , cpt ( _ e.g. _  ref.@xcite ) , lebit ( _ e.g. _  ref.@xcite ) and jyfltrap ( _ e.g. _  refs .",

    "the latter measurement was based on a  precision time - of - flight measuring system \" with the q3d spectrograph at the munich tandem laboratory ; it was one of seven superallowed @xmath33 values that appeared in a single publication @xcite and had stood unchallenged for nearly 30 years .",
    "however , the @xmath45v discrepancy was soon confirmed by a second penning trap , jyfltrap , which also identified similar disagreements with the munich measurements for three other cases , @xmath44sc , @xmath46mn and @xmath47co @xcite .",
    "when a repeat ( @xmath8he,@xmath37 ) measurement @xcite , made at munich in 2009 with much of the same equipment , agreed with the penning trap results , it was decided to eliminate ref.@xcite from surveyed world data @xcite .",
    "fortunately , this was the only significant disagreement found between penning - trap results and those from earlier reaction measurements .",
    "it has since been demonstrated that one can safely combine the results of both types of measurement without including any additional systematic uncertainties @xcite .    to date , the most precise penning - trap measurements of superallowed @xmath33 values have been done by eronen and collaborators with the jyfltrap trap at the university of jyvaskyla , where it is coupled to a cyclotron through their ion guide isotope separator on line ( igisol ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to all the refinements to achieve high trap precision , this facility has an added advantage : it can produce both parent and daughter nuclei with the same beam .",

    "must be balanced the disadvantage presented by the positrons broad energy distribution , which can not in general be used to distinguish one decaying nuclide from another . without some external means of ensuring source purity , a decay measurement can easily be invalidated by the presence of an undetected impurity .",
    "typically , before 1983 , activities were produced by low - energy proton beams on enriched targets , a combination that minimized contaminant activities but could not eliminate them entirely . in a few cases , where impurities were identified ,",
    "their contribution was corrected for ( _ e.g. _  refs.@xcite ) but , in most cases , purity was simply a fervent belief . since 1983",
    "however , with rare exceptions all measurements have employed sources produced via either an on - line isotope separator  first at chalk river ( _ e.g. _  ref.@xcite ) and later at triumf ( _ e.g. _  ref.@xcite )  or the magnetic recoil spectrometer at the texas a&m cyclotron ( _ e.g. _  ref.@xcite ) .",

    ", the activity was produced from the @xmath67h(@xmath102ti,2@xmath9)@xmath45v reaction initiated by a 1.5-gev beam of @xmath102ti from the k500 cyclotron .",
    "the fully stripped reaction products exiting the gas cell entered the momentum achromat recoil spectrometer ( mars ) @xcite , where they were separated according to their charge - to - mass ratio @xmath103 , with @xmath45v being selected by slits in the focal plane .",
    "a position - sensitive silicon detector was periodically inserted at the focal plane to identify and monitor any weak contaminants that were also passing through the slits .",
    "the purified @xmath45v beam was extracted into air , degraded and implanted into the 76-@xmath101m - thick aluminized mylar tape of a fast tape - transport system . the combination of @xmath103 selectivity in mars and range sensitivity in the degraders led to collected samples of radioactive @xmath45v , in which the only interfering activity was determined to contribute less than 0.012% to the total . after",
    "a sample had been collected for 0.5s , the beam was turned off and the tape moved the sample 90 cm into the center of the shielded 4@xmath100 gas detector , where it stopped less than 200ms later .",
    "signals from the detector were then multiscaled for 10s , which is more than 20 half - lives of @xmath45v .",
    "this cycle was repeated many thousands of times until the desired statistics had been reached .    in all measurements of this type , the counting electronics",
    "impose a well - defined non - extendable dead time . this dead time as well as other measurement parameters , such as detector bias and discriminator levels ,",
    "are altered from time to time in order to test for possible systematic effects .",
    "careful analysis and fitting procedures are applied and these procedures are checked with hypothetical data , computer - generated by monte carlo techniques to simulate closely the experimental counting conditions .    in recent years",
    "this system has also been used to measure the half - lives of @xmath38=@xmath39 superallowed parents such as @xmath99ca ( see fig.[fig:38decays ] ) .",
    "there a complication arises : the @xmath2 decay of the @xmath38=@xmath39 parent feeds a second superallowed decay , from the @xmath38=0 daughter to the @xmath38=+1 granddaughter .",
    "of course , the positrons from both decays are recorded simultaneously in the @xmath2 detector .",
    "the time - decay spectrum is therefore the sum of the decay of the parent and the growth - and - decay of the daughter .",
    "typically , the parent s half - life is about a factor of two shorter than the daughter s , so the decay of the daughter almost completely masks the decay of the parent ( _ e.g. _  see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "however the composite decay can still be used to determine the parent s half - life if three conditions are met : 1 ) the half - life of the daughter is known precisely from an independent measurement ; 2 ) the @xmath38=@xmath39 parent activity deposited on the transport tape is pure ; and 3 ) the rate at which it is deposited is known .",
    "the first condition can easily be met by a measurement of the type already described for @xmath45v ; the second is assured by the combination of electromagnetic separation ( mars ) and range selectivity ; and the third was met by insertion of a thin scintillator into the degrader stack ( see fig.[fig : tamuexp ] ) , from which the number of ions were recorded as a function of time during sample collection .    with these methods , half - lives with a relative precision of @xmath550.03% for @xmath38=@xmath39 parents ( _ e.g. _  @xmath66si @xcite ) and @xmath550.01% for @xmath38=0 parents ( _ e.g. _  @xmath45v @xcite )",

    "a result of comparable precision was also obtained for @xmath42al at triumf @xcite , where the same type of gas counter was used but with the sample produced by their isotope separator isac .",
    "very recently another measurement of the @xmath42al half - life with similar precision has been reported @xcite , for which digital pulse - analysis was used to process signals from the 4@xmath100 gas detector instead of analogue electronics .",
    "this meant that parameters like dead - time and discriminator level could be investigated , after the fact , on the saved pulse shapes , thus improving the efficiency of data - taking .",
    "the relative precision quoted for this measurement was also at the 0.01% precision level , with some promise for future improvement .",
    "for a half - life measurement , high - resolution @xmath64-ray detection makes source purity a much less critical requirement , since analysis can focus on the photopeak of a @xmath64 ray that is characteristic of the activity of interest .",
    "this is the method s principal advantage . on the other side of the ledger",
    "must be placed the relatively low efficiency of germanium detectors and the slow signals that are derived from them , with the consequently long time required to process those signals .",
    "the latter introduces uncertainties in accounting for dead time and especially for pulse pile - up , which is of course rate dependent .",
    "a further disadvantage is that the method can only be applied to @xmath38=@xmath39 parents of superallowed decays since they are the only ones that produce @xmath2-delayed @xmath64 rays of sufficient intensity ( see fig.[fig:38decays ] ) .",

    "the @xmath2 signals were handled in a very similar way to that used with a gas proportional counter .",
    "the results are revealing : the half - life obtained from @xmath64 counting was @xmath104s , while from @xmath2 counting it was @xmath105s . though the two measurements were made simultaneously on the same collected sources , both the statistical and systematic uncertainties were larger when @xmath64-rays were employed . happily though the two results agreed with one another well within their quoted uncertainties .",
    "of the three experimental quantities ",
    "@xmath33 values , half - lives and branching ratios  needed to obtain an @xmath5 value , the most difficult to measure precisely is the branching - ratio .",
    "since the continuous energy distribution of emitted positrons leaves little opportunity to distinguish one transition from another , such measurements must be based on detection of the @xmath2-delayed @xmath64 rays emitted from levels populated in the @xmath2-decay daughter . to make matters more difficult , in most cases",
    "one of the @xmath2 transitions populates the ground state or an isomeric state , from which no @xmath64-ray signal is forthcoming .",
    "thus it is not enough to measure the relative branching to excited states .",
    "what is needed is the absolute branching for each transition : _",
    "i.e. _  the fraction each accounts for out of the total decays of the parent nucleus .    what are the competing transitions ?",
    "since the parents of our decays of interest have spin - parity @xmath0 , they can populate @xmath106 states in the daughter by allowed gamow - teller decay , in addition to populating the analogue @xmath0 state by the superallowed ( fermi ) branch .",
    "furthermore , weak fermi branches are also possible to excited @xmath0 states via charge - driven mixing with the analogue state .",
    "the nuclear structure of the daughter nucleus and the energy available for the parent s @xmath2 decay together determine how many such states can be populated .    here",
    "again the challenges are different for the decays of @xmath38=0 superallowed parents compared to the @xmath38=@xmath39 cases .",
    "the superallowed branch from each @xmath38=0 parent carries @xmath10799% of the decay strength and populates the ground state of its daughter ( see fig.[fig:38decays ] ) . to determine its exact branching ratio ,",
    "all that is required is to measure the weak competing branches , if any , with modest precision and subtract their total from 100% .",
    "since the absolute value of the uncertainty on the total of the weak branches becomes the uncertainty on the superallowed branch , a poor relative precision on the former becomes a very good relative precision on the latter .",
    "for example , the decay of @xmath44sc includes a single competing gamow - teller @xmath2-decay branch to the 1.84-mev state in @xmath44ca .",
    "its branching ratio , based on four separate measurements , is 0.0059(14)% @xcite , a result with @xmath624% relative precision .",
    "the superallowed branching ratio obtained from this result is 99.9941(14 ) , which has a relative precision of @xmath60.0014% ! obviously , high precision is not the issue with these measurements .",
    "rather , the difficulty lies in even observing branches with relative intensities that are less than 100 parts per million of the total decay .",
    "the decays of @xmath38=@xmath39 superallowed parents are quite different . in general",
    "they are characterized by much stronger competing gamow - teller transitions ( see fig.[fig:38decays ] ) and , in a few cases , the superallowed branch is not even the strongest transition : in @xmath4c decay , for example , the superallowed branch only accounts for 1.4646(19)% of the total decay strength @xcite .",
    "in addition , with two exceptions  @xmath4c and @xmath40 mg  all the known cases include decay branches that do not produce a subsequent @xmath64 ray .",
    "consequently , absolute branching ratios must be determined , but without nearly the precision improvement factor just described for decays like that of @xmath44sc .",
    "these ratios must therefore be directly determined with @xmath550.1% precision .",
    "only very recently has it become possible to do so .      because the daughter of a @xmath38=0 superallowed parent is an even-@xmath32-even-@xmath97 nucleus , its excited @xmath106 and @xmath0 states are at a relatively high excitation energy above the @xmath0 ground state , which is strongly populated by the superallowed transition . for the lightest nuclei , with @xmath108@xmath10938 ,",
    "the @xmath2-decay energy window is such that none of these excited states is populated , the limit of observation being at @xmath5510 parts per million .",
    "however , as @xmath108 increases , the @xmath2-decay energy of the parent grows and the level density in the daughter increases ; so competing branches become greater in number and in strength . for @xmath44sc , the lightest emitter for which a non - superallowed @xmath2 branch has been observed , that branching ratio is 0.0059% ; while for @xmath49rb , the heaviest well - measured case , there are a number of competing branches , which total to a 0.50% branching ratio .",
    "there have been relatively few measurements of these weak non - superallowed branching ratios , since parts - per - million sensitivity is not easy to achieve .",
    "one example is the work of hagberg and collaborators @xcite at chalk river , who investigated four emitters , @xmath43k , @xmath45v , @xmath46mn and @xmath47co .",

    "a helium - jet gas - transfer system was used to convey each activity to a low - background counting location where the activity - loaded nacl aerosol clusters in the helium were deposited onto the aluminized mylar tape of a fast tape - transfer system . after a short collection period",
    ", typically @xmath550.5s , a paddle was inserted between the helium - jet nozzle and tape , and the tape moved the sample in sequence to two different detector stations , stopping at each ; then the cycle was repeated until adequate statistics had been acquired . to achieve the required sensitivity ,",

    "the equation highlights the importance of having a pure sample  so that @xmath125 can be relied upon  as well as having a precise absolute efficiency calibration for the @xmath64-ray detector , and a reasonable knowledge of relative efficiencies in the beta detector .",
    "the key ingredient that the texas a&m team has painstakingly developed is an hpge detector whose absolute efficiency has been accurately determined ( to @xmath60.2% for 50 - 1400 kev @xmath64 rays and to @xmath60.4% up to 3500 kev ) from source measurements and monte carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "this method yields the branching ratios of all transitions except the one to the ground ( or isomeric ) state which has no subsequent @xmath64 ray .",
    "however , the branching ratio of the latter transition can be obtained by subtracting the sum of the former branching ratios from 100% . in the case of the @xmath99ca decay , which is shown in fig.[fig:38decays ] ,",
    "the  missing \" transition is the superallowed one , and the subtraction from 100% actually has a very salutary effect on the relative precision , reducing it by more than a factor of 3 (= 22.7/77.3 ) . very recently with this system , the branching ratio for the @xmath99ca superallowed transition has been determined to @xmath60.2% @xcite .",

    "many independent measurements contribute to the determination of superallowed @xmath5 values , so for the past four decades we have periodically produced critical surveys of relevant world data available at the time of writing .",
    "all published measurements are carefully considered , with some being rejected but only if a specific fault has been identified . of the surviving results , only those with uncertainties that are within a factor of 10 of the most precise measurement for each quantity",
    "are retained .",

    "we present the results from the most recent survey @xcite . in almost all cases ,",
    "the tabulated values are averages of several  sometimes many  experimental measurements with comparable uncertainties .    for each superallowed transition",
    ", the three measured quantities , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , together with a small correction ( @xmath550.1% ) @xcite to account for the contribution of electron capture , are combined to obtain an @xmath5 value .",
    "these @xmath5 values appear in column five of the table .",
    "the next step is to use ( [ ftconst ] ) to obtain the corrected @xmath25 value for each transition . before doing this though",
    ", we need to examine the theoretical correction terms used to account for radiative and isospin - symmetry - breaking effects .",
    "as described in the introduction , the historical determination of the vector coupling constant @xmath11 in the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath3o and @xmath4c differed by a few percent from @xmath12 , which was obtained from the purely leptonic decay of the muon  seemingly violating universality as espoused by cabibbo . at the time though it was understood that radiative corrections could largely explain the discrepancy .",
    "simply put , the lifetimes measured in the decays of @xmath3o and @xmath4c include both the bare @xmath2-decay process and the radiative process , in which the emitted electron releases a bremsstrahlung photon that is undetected .",
    "since @xmath11 is determined from the bare @xmath2-decay process , the contribution from radiative effects needs to be computed and subtracted from the measured result .",
    "calculations of this contribution , however , have to consider not just the bremsstrahlung process alone but also the loop diagram in which a photon is exchanged between charged particles .",
    "the key point is that the bremsstrahlung contribution diverges in the limit when the photon energy goes to zero ; the loop graph likewise diverges but with the opposite sign , so the combination of the two remains finite in the low - energy limit . that this happens is a consequence of the renormalizability of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "there was another problem for the calculations performed in the 1950s @xcite : the loop graph also diverged in the limit of infinite photon energy , so some form of arbitrary cut - off had to be imposed .",
    "the difficulty at the time was what to choose for the cut - off : as the cut - off increased so did the discrepancy between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in this era",
    "the @xmath2-decay process was treated as a four - fermion contact interaction and the loop diagram was of triangular geometry .    during the 1960s ,",
    "the standard model began to be formulated and the four - fermion contact interaction was replaced by one in which an intermediate vector boson ",
    "the @xmath128 boson  mediated between the leptons and hadrons in semi - leptonic decay . with the @xmath128 boson , the loop diagram became of rectangular geometry and the mass of the boson then provided a natural cut - off @xcite .",
    "the standard model also introduced a neutral @xmath32 boson that mixed with the photon , so a further class of loop diagrams involving @xmath32-boson exchange had to be included in the radiative - correction calculation .",
    "the main effect of this addition was to increase the effective cut - off in the loop diagram from the @xmath128-boson mass to the @xmath32-boson mass @xcite .",
    "it was realized all along that the purely leptonic muon decay was also subject to radiative corrections and that many of the potential contributions were identical in both pure- and semi - leptonic decays .",
    "such identical contributions are called ` universal ' .",
    "thus , in the standard model , @xmath12 came to be defined as the weak - interaction coupling constant , with the understanding that it included within it all universal radiative corrections .",
    "thus , the radiative correction applied to the semi - leptonic decays only needed to include terms that were non - universal . a longer discussion of this point is given by sirlin @xcite .",
    "so far , the radiative correction was only calculated to lowest order in the fine - structure constant @xmath61 . in the 1970s ,",
    "jaus and rasche @xcite gave the first estimate of the order-@xmath129 contributions , where @xmath32 is the charge number of the daughter nucleus .",
    "this correction is defined as the contribution at this order not already contained in the product @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the fermi function , @xmath132 the electon total energy and @xmath133 the order-@xmath61 correction .",
    "also in the 1970s , experimental results of superallowed beta decay began to emerge in the higher-@xmath32 elements of @xmath44sc , @xmath45v , @xmath46mn and @xmath47co .",
    "these results raised a problem @xcite : the high-@xmath32 cases seemed to be failing the required cabibbo universality .",
    "this prompted a reexamination of the order-@xmath129 radiative correction by sirlin and zucchini @xcite and jaus and rasche @xcite .",
    "an error was discovered in the earlier work and cabibbo universality was duly recovered .    in the loop graph",
    "there is another interesting wrinkle .",
    "if the nucleus is treated as a collection of nucleons , and if the weak and the electromagnetic interactions occurring in the radiative correction interact with the same nucleon , then the graph evaluation leads to a result that is proportional to the expectation value of the isospin ladder operator .",
    "since the bare @xmath2-decay process also proceeds via the isospin ladder operator , the radiative correction simply scales with the bare @xmath2-decay value .",
    "this implies that the calculation is independent of nuclear structure , the result depending only on the electron energy and the charge @xmath32 of the daughter nucleus .",
    "if , however , the weak and electromagnetic interactions occur with different nucleons , then the scaling property fails and a full nuclear - structure - dependent calculation is required .",
    "the first such calculation was provided by jaus and rasche @xcite and later refined by towner @xcite .",
    "these results constitute the @xmath31 correction , which appears in ( [ ftconst ] ) .",
    "another property of the loop graph is that one can usefully employ different approximations for the hadronic structure depending upon whether the photon energy is small or large . at low photon energy , it is sufficient to treat the nucleus as a collection of nucleons and use nucleon weak and electromagnetic form factors at the vertices . at high photon energy ,",
    "the hadronic structure is essentially that of a soup of quarks . in this limit ,",
    "the calculation becomes independent of the details of hadronic structure and leads to the term @xmath29 in ( [ ftconst ] ) .",
    "marciano and sirlin @xcite have critically examined this separation into low- and high - energy contributions and the linkages between them .",
    "their recommended value for @xmath29 is in current use : = ( 2.361 0.038 ) % .",
    "lastly , a correction to order @xmath134 was recently considered by czarnecki , marciano and sirlin @xcite and is now included in current computations .",
    "all contributions to the radiative correction considered to date are collated into @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath29 as displayed in ( [ ftconst ] ) .",
    "the currently accepted values @xcite for @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given in columns six and seven of table  [ ftdata ] .",
    "the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis asserts that the vector coupling constant @xmath11 is not renormalized in the nuclear medium but is the same for all nuclei .",
    "this assertion can be tested by the measurement of superallowed @xmath2 decays , which cover a wide range of nuclei spanning from @xmath4c to @xmath49rb .",
    "however , the cvc hypothesis is only valid in the isospin - symmetry limit , so if we are to determine @xmath11 from a wide range of nuclei then a correction has first to be applied that removes the effects of isospin - symmetry breaking .",
    "isospin symmetry is naturally broken in nuclei because the protons are subject to the coulomb interaction , which is not felt by the neutrons .",
    "thus , the wave function of a proton in a given quantum state differs slightly from a neutron in the mirror nucleus in the same quantum state .",
    "this is reflected in the nuclear matrix element describing the beta - decay transition between mirror states .",
    "the isospin symmetry - breaking correction @xmath28 is defined by the relation |m_f|^2 =    matrix element and @xmath135 its isospin - symmetry - limit value , being just the expectation value of the isospin ladder operator .",
    "one of the earliest estimates of @xmath28 was provided by damgaard @xcite in 1969 .",
    "he suggested that the radial function of the proton in beta decay could be expanded in a complete set of neutron radial functions of the same angular momentum ; the terms in the set differing in the number of radial nodes in the function .",
    "the expansion coefficients were determined in perturbation theory , with the coulomb force being the perturbing interaction . with the basis states taken as harmonic oscillator functions",
    ", damgaard obtained the expression _",
    "c = ( n + 1)(n + + ) .",
    "[ dam1 ] if one adopts the relationships for the characteristic oscillator energy , @xmath136 mev , and the nuclear radius , @xmath137 fm , this expression becomes _ c = 0.2645 z^2 a^-2/3 ( n+1 ) ( n + + ) , [ dam2 ] which , for the relatively light nuclei we are interested in here , exhibits the general behaviour @xmath138 with some shell structure superimposed through the choice of oscillator quantum numbers @xmath9 and @xmath139 .",
    "in particular , a proton radial function with one radial node gets a factor of 2 enhancement in its @xmath28 value over one that has no radial nodes simply from the factor @xmath140 in ( [ dam2 ] ) .",
    "this enhancement is clearly evident in table  [ ftdata ] for the upper @xmath141 shell , where there is a significant increase in experimental @xmath5 value when going from @xmath47co ( @xmath5=3051s ) to @xmath48ga ( @xmath5=3074s ) .    beginning in 1973 ,",
    "damgaard s approach has been improved upon by towner and hardy @xcite in two significant ways .",
    "the oscillator basis states have been replaced by eigenfunctions of a woods - saxon potential and the extreme non - interacting single - particle model has been replaced by the interacting shell model . the perturbing coulomb force is long range and influences a huge number of configurations in the shell model .",
    "thus it has become expedient to divide @xmath28 into two components _ c = _",
    "c2  , [ dc1dc2 ] where @xmath142 is a contribution from a finite - sized shell - model calculation , typically containing all configurations within one major shell , while @xmath143 steps outside that model space to states that typically have a different number of radial nodes influencing the proton and neutron radial functions . for superallowed transitions between the @xmath0 states of interest here , towner and hardy @xcite",
    "find that the @xmath142 contributions are much smaller than the @xmath143 ones .",
    "their results are shown in table  [ t : tab2 ] , where they are labelled sm - ws .",
    "we note that these results are considered to be semi - phenomenological since a number of isospin - specific nuclear properties have been fitted in their derivation : @xmath144  the measured proton and neutron separation energies in the parents and daughters , respectively , were used in the calculation of @xmath143 ; and each calculation of @xmath142 was tuned to fit the @xmath145- and @xmath146-coefficients in the isobaric multiplet mass equation corresponding to the specific @xmath147 multiplet that included the parent and daughter state .    from 1985 to 1995 , ormand and brown @xcite adopted the same general procedure as the one just described but used eigenfunctions of a hartree - fock mean field rather than a woods - saxon potential .",
    "their results were systematically smaller than the sm - ws values and this difference was used to assess a systematic error in the analysis of superallowed beta - decay data .",
    "this systematic difference , however , was much reduced by a 2009 calculation of hardy and towner @xcite , in which the protocol for the hartree - fock calculation was altered to ensure that the coulomb part of the proton mean field obtained from the hartree - fock calculation had the appropriate asymptotic form .",
    "the results from this calculation are labelled sm - hf in table  [ t : tab2 ] .    besides damgaard s model and the two shell - model approaches to @xmath28 , which apply to the full range of measured superallowed transitions ,",
    "there have been many other less - complete computations by various authors @xcite using a diverse set of nuclear models .",
    "there are too many to discuss all these cases here .",
    "we have selected two of them , one based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and the other on density functional theories ( dft ) to include in table  [ t : tab2 ] . in the former , the rpa work of sagawa _ et al _ @xcite , improved upon by liang _",

    "the particle - hole calculation is carried out in the charge - exchange version of the rpa .",

    "we considered that this provided a valid estimate of the systematic ( theoretical ) uncertainty , and so incorporated it into the overall result by deriving two average @xmath149 values , one for each set of @xmath28 calculations , then adopting the average of the two and assigning a systematic uncertainty equal to half the spread between them .",

    "the top - row sum provides the most demanding test of ckm unitarity , @xmath20 is its dominant contributor , and superallowed @xmath2 decay is effectively the sole experimental source for the value of @xmath20 .",

    "discussions of these issues can be found in @xcite as well as in other contributions to this volume .",
    "because the unitary ckm matrix is an essential pillar of the standard model , the uncertainty limits on the unitarity sum in ( [ usum ] ) constrain the scope of whatever new physics may be anticipated to lie beyond that model . consequently",
    ", there is ample motivation to search for improvements in both theory and experiment that can reduce the uncertainty on the sum , and potentially expose  or rule out  some classes of new physics .",

    "however , improvements in the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections , @xmath28 and @xmath31 , can actually be achieved with the help of experiments . as described in section [ ss : deltc ] , these terms are subject to a test : they can be applied to the uncorrected experimental @xmath5 values to obtain a set of @xmath25 values , which can then be evaluated for the consistency required by cvc ",
    "see ( [ deltactest ] ) and table  [ t : tab2 ] . the more precisely the @xmath5 values have been measured , the more demanding this test can be ; and if new superallowed transitions with larger predicted nuclear corrections can be measured , the test will be improved still more .    of particular importance in this context",
    "are superallowed @xmath0@xmath1decays of the @xmath38=@xmath39 nuclei @xmath66si , @xmath41ar , @xmath99ca and @xmath44ti . as noted in section [ tz-1 ] , these decays are more complex than the currently well studied superallowed transitions , which mostly have @xmath38=0 parents . only very recently have",
    "@xmath38=@xmath39 decays in this mass region become amenable to precise @xmath5-value measurements @xcite and it is anticipated that all four will be fully characterized within the next few years .",
    "these cases will be influential not only because they have relatively large nuclear corrections but also because each of the four transitions is mirror to another well known transition , @xmath42al , @xmath41cl , @xmath43k and @xmath44sc , respectively .",
    "it turns out that the ratio of the @xmath5-values for mirror superallowed transitions is extremely sensitive to the model used to calculate @xmath28 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "there is good reason to expect that these new cases will tighten the model constraints enough to shrink or even remove entirely the systematic uncertainty now applied to the structure - dependent correction terms .",
    "the potential improvements in all the correction terms should act to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath20 by about 25% and , together with the improvements expected in @xmath160 , can be expected to reduce the uncertainty in the ckm unitarity sum ",
