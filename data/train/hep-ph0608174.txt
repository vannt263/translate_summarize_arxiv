    "in hadron collisions , the cleanest signature for the higgs boson decay @xmath3 is two isolated opposite - sign leptons plus missing transverse energy ( @xmath4 ) from the neutrinos in @xmath5 .",
    "one class of reducible backgrounds involves processes with heavy - flavor ( hf ) hadrons in the final state , such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , where at least one lepton comes from the decay of a hf hadron ( a hadron that includes either a bottom or charm quark ) . in this report",
    "i summarize a recent study  @xcite in which we demonstrate that isolation does not sufficiently suppress these hf backgrounds .",
    "rather , the size of the heavy - flavor background is determined by details of the applied physics cuts , and current analyses must be improved to remove this background to @xmath3 .",
    "we provide a full simulation of the backgrounds for @xmath9 , following the analysis chains of two studies : one by the d0@xmath10  collaboration  @xcite from which a limit is set on @xmath11 at the tevatron , and one by the atlas collaboration  @xcite that estimates the reach at the lhc . the heavy - flavor background could be overwhelming with the default cuts at the lhc , but we propose a new , more restrictive cut that would significantly reduce the background .",
    "we emphasize the value of direct measurements of the magnitude and kinematic variation the heavy - flavor background in the tevatron and lhc data .",
    "space restrictions limit this brief summary to our lhc investigation .",
    "the issue for the heavy flavor backgrounds is the extent to which lepton isolation and subsequent kinematic physics cuts can suppress them .",
    "the nature of the challenge at the lhc is illustrated by a comparison of @xmath12  pb for @xmath13 to @xmath14  gev , with the size of @xmath15  pb .",
    "isolation in @xmath16 even at the @xmath17 level leaves a hf @xmath18 background that is @xmath19 greater than the signal .",
    "we must address questions of both the magnitude and the shape of the backgrounds .    in order to make statements regarding experimental issues , we require a detailed simulation of reconstructed events .",
    "we run events through the pythia 6.322  @xcite showering monte carlo , and feed the output through a heavily modified version of pgs  @xcite that reproduces the results of the relevant full atlas detector simulations to within 10%  @xcite .",
    "this code has a more accurate treatment of geometric effects and efficiencies than atlfast .",
    "the atlas physics cuts described in the atlas technical design report ( tdr )  @xcite are then applied to the objects found in pgs .",
    "we use madevent 3.0  @xcite to generate hard events , and we match the cross sections after showering to the differential next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cross sections . for @xmath20 and the relevant single - top - quark process ,",
    "a @xmath21 factor times a leading - order ( lo ) distribution is sufficient to retain all angular correlations .",
    "continuum @xmath22 and @xmath23 are evaluated using pythia routines with @xmath21 factors .",
    ".cross sections ( in fb ) for opposite - sign leptons as a function of cuts for the 160 gev higgs boson atlas analysis .",
    "@xmath24 production is a lower limit based on limited phase space .",
    "a dash indicates statistics are too small to estimate .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab : atlcutline ] we show the cross sections we compute for opposite - sign dileptons .",
    "the second column shows the signal process @xmath25 , and the remaining columns display the backgrounds that we examine , beginning with continuum @xmath26 production and followed by several heavy flavor backgrounds .",
    "the first level of cuts requires two isolated leptons , each with @xmath27 gev and @xmath28 .",
    "isolation of electrons and muons replicates recent atlas descriptions  @xcite , and it is applied within the modified pgs detector simulation .",
    "next , a cut is placed on the transverse energy of the reconstructed highest-@xmath29 lepton @xmath30 of @xmath31 gev . a fairly high missing energy of 40  gev",
    "is then required .",
    "spin correlations in @xmath32 tend to send the leptons in the same direction .",
    "consequently , their invariant mass is low , and atlas requires @xmath33  gev .",
    "likewise , the angle between the leptons should also be small , and an aggressive cut is made on the azimuthal angle between the leptons , @xmath34 .",
    "the next - to - last cut is a veto of any event having a jet with @xmath35  gev , and @xmath36 .",
    "it serves to reject background from @xmath37 production .",
    "finally , a tight cut is made on the transverse mass @xmath38 of the dilepton and missing energy .",
    "it appears naively to remove most of the heavy - flavor background .",
    "the final cut on @xmath38 is the key to the atlas sensitivity . in fig.[fig : atlmtll](a ) we see a comparison of the higgs boson signal , the continuum @xmath26 background , and the heavy - flavor backgrounds .",
    "the hf backgrounds are more than an order of magnitude larger than the previously calculated backgrounds for @xmath39  gev . as a result of the physics cuts and lepton isolation ,",
    "the @xmath40 background has been suppressed by 11 orders of magnitude .",
    "it is unlikely that the tail of this distribution cuts off sharply at 125  gev",
    ". it would be difficult to believe an excess observed in the region @xmath41  gev without a measurement of this hf background .",
    "even for a 200  gev higgs boson , the median transverse mass is below 140  gev , leading to poor mass resolution if events are observed .",
    "fortunately , we can reduce the hf background to a manageable level by pushing the @xmath38 mass peak associated with the heavy - flavors below 110120  gev .",
    "the distribution in @xmath29 of the leading lepton in the @xmath42jets and single - top samples is fairly insensitive to small increases in the @xmath29 threshold near 20  gev .",
    "this feature is not surprising since the leptons come from real @xmath0 decays .",
    "the leading lepton from @xmath43 or @xmath44 decay falls faster , but an increase in the cut will not improve the overall significance .",
    "on the other hand , the next - to - leading lepton has an exponentially falling background as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "an increase of the minimum transverse energy cut on additional leptons from 10 gev to 20  gev reduces the background by roughly a factor of 20 , while maintaining about @xmath45 of the signal and continuum @xmath26 backgrounds . in particular",
    ", the dangerous @xmath40 background drops by a factor of 30 , the @xmath46 backgrounds go down a factor of 10 , and single - top - quark production goes down a factor of 5 .",
    "such a cut is nearly a `` magic bullet '' for higgs boson masses above 140  gev .",
    "an estimate of the effect of this one change in the cuts is shown for the signal and total backgrounds in fig .",
    "[ fig : atlmtll](b ) .",
    "the leading edge of the heavy - flavor transverse - mass peak is 20  gev lower than with the default cuts . the downward shift of this leading edge , along with the lower overall magnitude of the background , protects the higgs boson signal region from uncertainties in the modeling of the heavy - flavor background",
    ". the residual hf background will still be measurable at lower @xmath38 , and it provides a control sample .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that despite small efficiencies , heavy - flavor decays into leptons are a potentially serious background .",
    "an increase in the transverse - energy cut of secondary leptons is effective at reducing the background , but every level of cuts is significant .",
    "some of the proposed cuts are sensitive to actual detector performance , noise , and the underlying event  none of which will be known until data are accumulated .",
    "extrapolations of the magnitude and shape of the hf background using monte carlo techniques have large inherent uncertainties .",
    "we recommend that the hf background be measured with cuts as close as possible to the final sample . at the lhc",
    "the hf background is large enough that it can be studied in the @xmath38 distribution and fully controlled .",
    "although our study focuses on @xmath23 , it raises a broader question of the potential danger of heavy - flavor leptons in multi - lepton analyses .",
    "for example , trilepton searches for supersymmetry typically have soft additional leptons .",
    "there could be a significant impact on analyses of these types of signals if lepton transverse momentum cuts must be raised to remove the heavy - flavor leptons .    in investigations at linear colliders ,",
    "the higgs boson decay @xmath47 can be reconstructed fully from hadronic decays of the @xmath0 in the higgs - strahlung process @xmath48 , with @xmath49 or @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction @xmath51 can be measured to @xmath52% accuracy in @xmath53 , with @xmath54  jets or @xmath55  jets .",
    "studies of the decay mode @xmath56 do not appear necessary for access to the @xmath57 coupling or branching fraction , but there may be interesting additional information to be gained . in @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , there should be interesting kinematic signatures in the four - charged - lepton final state .",
