    "this work focuses on subspace migration for the imaging of small perfectly conducting cracks located in the homogeneous , two - dimensional space @xmath0 in limited - view inverse scattering problems .",
    "subspace migration is a simple and effective imaging technique , and is thus applied to many inverse scattering problems .",
    "for this reason , various remarkable properties have been investigated in many studies .",
    "related work can be found in @xcite and the references therein .    based on these studies",
    ", it turns out that subspace migration can be applied not only in full - view but also limited - view inverse scattering problems .",
    "however , the use of subspace migration - based imaging techniques has been applied heuristically .",
    "although the structure of subspace migration in full - view inverse scattering problems has been established  @xcite , it is still applied heuristically in limited - view problems .",
    "hence , a mathematical identification of its structure in such problems still needs to be performed , which is the motivation for our work .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis @xcite of the structure of subspace migration in the full - view problem to the limited - view problem of imaging perfectly conducting cracks of small length .",
    "this is based on the fact that the far - field pattern can be represented by the asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of such cracks . from the identified structure ,",
    "we find a condition for successful imaging .",
    "subsequently , the structure of multi - frequency subspace migration is analyzed .",
    "this shows how the application of multiple frequencies enhances its applicability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we survey two - dimensional direct scattering problems , the asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of small cracks , and subspace migration . in section [ sec3 ] , we investigate the structure of single- and multi - frequency subspace migration in limited - view problems by finding a relationship with integer - order bessel functions of the first kind .",
    "section [ sec4 ] presents some numerical examples to support our investigation .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce two - dimensional direct scattering problems in the presence of small , linear perfectly conducting crack(s ) , the asymptotic expansion formula , and subspace migration .",
    "let @xmath1 be a straight line segment that describes a perfectly conducting crack of small length @xmath2 , @xmath3 with this @xmath1 , let @xmath4 satisfy the following helmholtz equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes a strictly positive wavenumber with wavelength @xmath7 and we assume that @xmath8 is not an eigenvalue of ( [ helmholtz ] ) .",
    "it is well known that the total field @xmath4 can be decomposed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the incident field with direction @xmath11 on the two - dimensional unit circle @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the unknown scattered field satisfying the sommerfeld radiation condition @xmath14 uniformly in all directions @xmath15 .",
    "the far - field pattern @xmath16 of the scattered field @xmath13 is defined on @xmath12 and can be represented as @xmath17 uniformly in all directions @xmath15 and @xmath18 . based on @xcite , the far - field pattern",
    "can then be represented as the following asymptotic expansion formula .",
    "let @xmath4 satisfy ( [ helmholtz ] ) and @xmath19 .",
    "then , for @xmath20 , the following asymptotic expansion holds : @xmath21      at this point , we apply ( [ asymptoticformula ] ) to explain an imaging technique known as subspace migration . from @xcite , subspace migration",
    "is based on the structure of singular vectors of the collected multi - static response ( msr ) matrix @xmath22_{m , n=1}^{n},\\ ] ] whose elements @xmath23 make up the far - field pattern with incident number @xmath24 and observation number @xmath25 . from now on , we assume that there exist @xmath26 different small cracks @xmath27 with the same length @xmath28 , centered at @xmath29 , @xmath30 . the asymptotic expansion formula ( [ asymptoticformula ] )",
    "can then be represented as follows : @xmath31      the subspace migration imaging algorithm is based on the structure of the singular vectors of the msr matrix @xmath32 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "suppose that the incident and observation directions coincide .",
    "in this case , for each @xmath33 , the @xmath34th element of the msr matrix becomes @xmath35 now , let us define a unit vector @xmath36^t\\ ] ] such that @xmath32 can be decomposed as @xmath37    using this decomposition , we can introduce the subspace migration imaging algorithm . by performing singular value decomposition ( svd ) on @xmath32 @xmath38",
    "we can observe that the left- and right - singular vectors , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , satisfy @xmath41 hence , by defining an imaging functional @xmath42 we can obtain the shape of @xmath27 based on the orthogonality of the singular vectors .",
    "here , @xmath43 . a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we carefully explore the structure of subspace migration in limited view problems and discuss its properties .",
    "suppose that each @xmath11 is an element of @xmath44 such that @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "from this , we will derive a useful approximation in the following lemma .",
    "this will play a key role in our exploration .",
    "[ lemma ] assume that @xmath48 is sufficiently large , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "then , the following approximation holds : @xmath51    let us consider polar coordinates , such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 . because the jacobi  anger expansion @xmath54 holds uniformly ( see @xcite ) , we can evaluate @xmath55 assume that @xmath56 is sufficiently large .",
    "as the following asymptotic form holds @xmath57 we can neglect the term @xmath58 this completes the proof .",
    "based on lemma [ lemma ] , we can immediately obtain the following results .",
    "[ theorem1 ] for sufficiently large @xmath59 , @xmath60 can be written as @xmath61    since the incident and observation direction configurations are the same , we set @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "then , applying lemma [ lemma ] yields @xmath65 therefore , we can obtain @xmath66 this finishes the proof .",
    "based on recent work ( see @xcite ) , it has been confirmed that a multi - frequency approach gives better results than applying a single frequency .",
    "the following theorem supports this fact .",
    "[ theorem2 ] let @xmath67 and @xmath59 be sufficiently large .",
    "then , multi - frequency subspace migration @xmath68 can be written as follows @xmath69 .",
    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    similar to the proof of lemma [ lemma ] , we consider polar coordinates such that @xmath52 and @xmath70 .",
    "then , according to ( [ imagingfunctionsingle ] ) , we can observe that @xmath71 using this , we apply an indefinite integral formula of the bessel function ( see @xcite ) @xmath72 thus , we immediately obtain @xmath73 based on ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.4 ) , the last term of ( [ integralequation ] ) can be disregarded .",
    "hence , we obtain ( [ structureimagingfunctionmultiple ] ) .    based on lemma 3.1 , theorems 3.2 and 3.3 , we can examine certain properties .",
    "they can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the condition of sufficiently large @xmath48 is a very strong assumption .",
    "if this condition is not fulfilled , the term @xmath74 of ( [ imagingfunctionsingle ] ) will disturb the imaging performance .",
    "this is why the application of a high frequency yields good results , and why subspace migration in the full - view problem offers better results than in the limited - view case .",
    "2 .   if @xmath75 is close to @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 is small , then @xmath56 is not sufficiently large and we can not use the asymptotic form ( [ asymptoticbessel ] ) .",
    "this means that the remaining term of lemma [ lemma ] @xmath78 is not negligible , so some blurring effects will appear in the neighborhood of cracks ( refer to figure [ result ] ) .",
    "conversely , if the location of @xmath75 is far from @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 is large , then the map of @xmath60 will be plotted at @xmath79 .",
    "in order to support some identified properties in theorems [ theorem1 ] and [ theorem2 ] , we now present some numerical examples . for this purpose , @xmath80 different incident and observation directions",
    "are applied , such that @xmath81 the applied wavenumber is of the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , is the given wavelength and @xmath85 are equi - distributed in the interval @xmath86 $ ] with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the far - field pattern data @xmath89 are generated by a fredholm integral equation of the second kind along the crack introduced in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 4 ) to avoid committing inverse crimes .",
    "three cracks @xmath27 with small length @xmath90 are chosen for the numerical simulations , with @xmath91^t:-\\ell\\leq t\\leq\\ell\\right\\}}\\\\    \\sigma_2&={\\left\\{\\mathfrak{r}_{\\pi/4}[t+0.4,t+0.35]^t:-\\ell\\leq t\\leq\\ell\\right\\}}\\\\    \\sigma_3&={\\left\\{\\mathfrak{r}_{7\\pi/6}[t+0.25,t-0.6]^t:-\\ell\\leq t\\leq\\ell\\right\\}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath92 denotes rotation by @xmath93 .",
    "+    figure [ result ] shows maps of @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the full- and limited - view cases .",
    "based on theorem [ theorem1 ] , the locations of the @xmath27 are successfully identified , but many replicas and blurring effects in the neighborhood of cracks disturb the identification . however , applying a multi - frequency yields a more accurate result than the single - frequency case .",
    "this supports theorem [ theorem2 ] . in any case",
    ", we can conclude that our analysis demonstrates that subspace migration can determine the location of small cracks in limited - view problems .",
    "in this paper , we considered subspace migration for the imaging of small , perfectly conducting cracks .",
    "based on a relation with an integer - order bessel function of the first kind , we confirmed the effectiveness of subspace migration in limited - view inverse scattering problems under certain strong assumptions .",
    "we also identified some particular properties of the structure of this migration .",
    "the main subject of this paper is the imaging of small cracks .",
    "extension to the imaging of arbitrary shaped , arc - like cracks will be considered in future work .",
    "although we considered a two - dimensional problem , its extension to three dimensions will be an interesting challenge .",
