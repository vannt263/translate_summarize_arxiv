    "the ubiquity of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the nuclei of many galaxies ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests that binary and multiple smbh systems may also be widespread .",
    "for example , smbh binaries should form in galaxy mergers ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ) , which is a common process in hierarchical models for galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; menou , haiman , & narayanan 2001 ) .",
    "smbh binaries have been invoked to explain periodic wiggles in extragalactic radio jets ( e.g. roos , kaastra , & hummel 1993 ) , periodic flares in the bl lac source oj  287 ( e.g. lehto & valtonen 1996 ) , variations in the apparent superluminal transverse velocities and position angles of the 3c  273 radio jet ( romero et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the `` core - type '' nuclear surface brightness profiles of bright elliptical galaxies ( ebisuzaki , makino , & okumura 1991 ; quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ) .",
    "smbh binary mergers would be powerful sources of gravitational waves ( thorne & braginsky 1976 ) which should be easily detectable from planned space - based gravitational wave observatories such as the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( bender et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , it is still uncertain whether binary smbhs can evolve to small enough semimajor axes that gravitational radiation drives them to merge .",
    "energy can be extracted from a wide binary through interactions with surrounding matter .",
    "for example , encounters with passing stars will shrink the binary , but this process will eventually be limited by the depletion of stars on sufficiently radial orbits to encounter the ever tightening binary",
    ". detailed work on this aspect of the problem has been done by numerous authors ( e.g. quinlan 1996 , quinlan & hernquist 1997 , milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ) .",
    "a key uncertainty is the amount of stochastic wandering that the binary undergoes at the bottom of the potential well of the galaxy , allowing it to interact with many more stars .",
    "another important process that has received relatively less attention is interaction with surrounding gas , which can also extract energy from the binary and drive it to merge ( e.g. armitage & natarajan 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "large galaxies are typically the product of multiple mergers over the history of the universe .",
    "if the characteristic merger time of binary smbhs is not much less than the characteristic time scale between mergers , then interactions with a third smbh or a second smbh binary will likely take place .",
    "strong encounters within these multiple black hole systems may lead to slingshot ejections of smbhs from the nucleus of the galaxy ( valtonen et al .",
    "1994 , valtonen 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the very existence of the additional galaxy merger may introduce more stellar encounters with the original central binary and drive it to merge ( roos 1988 ) . moreover , repeated encounters between a third black hole and the inner binary can increase the probability that the inner binary attains a large eccentricity , thereby accelerating the energy and angular momentum loss by gravitational radiation ( makino & ebisuzaki 1994 ) .",
    "a modification of the last scenario is a case where the third black hole has evolved to the point that it has become bound to the smbh binary , but has not yet come close enough for an unstable three - body interaction to take place .",
    "the system then forms a hierarchical triple and can be treated as consisting of an inner binary and an outer binary . in that case , if the mutual inclination angle between the inner and outer binaries is high enough , then the time - averaged tidal gravitational force on the inner binary can induce an oscillation in its eccentricity .",
    "this effect is known as the kozai mechanism ( kozai 1962 ) .",
    "provided all other dynamical influences are negligible ( see section 2 ) , an initially very small eccentricity in the inner binary will oscillate through a maximum value given by @xmath0 provided @xmath1 , i.e. the initial mutual inclination angle @xmath2 lies between roughly @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( kozai 1962 ) .",
    "given that the gravitational wave merger time is a strong function of eccentricity ( approximately proportional to @xmath5^{7/2}$ ] ) , highly inclined orbits could in principle greatly reduce the merger time .",
    "for example , a mutual inclination angle of @xmath6 results in eccentricity oscillations which , when at maximum amplitude , reduce the characteristic merger time by an order of magnitude .",
    "although the true merger time will depend on how long the inner binary spends at high eccentricity , it appears promising that a random distribution of initial inclinations will result in dramatically accelerated mergers in many cases .",
    "this is the subject we will explore in the present paper .",
    "while this research was being completed , we learned of recent work by miller & hamilton ( 2002 ) , who investigate a very similar idea : the use of the kozai mechanism to accelerate binary mergers in triple black hole systems formed in globular clusters .",
    "we begin in section 2 by going through the characteristic time scales which will affect the dynamics of triple supermassive black hole systems .",
    "then in section 3 we summarize the evolution equations of an isolated triple used in our numerical calculations .",
    "section 4 presents the results of those calculations , which help delineate the regions of initial condition parameter space where the kozai mechanism plays a substantial role in accelerating the merger of the inner binary .",
    "we discuss our results and summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "consider a binary system consisting of two black holes with masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with initial semimajor axis @xmath9 and eccentricity @xmath10 .",
    "the time it takes for the binary to merge due to gravitational wave emission ( peters 1964 ) can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a weak function of the initial eccentricity that is of order unity ( @xmath13 for all @xmath10 ) .",
    "this gravitational wave merger time is a strong function of both the semimajor axis and the eccentricity .",
    "hence gravitational radiation only becomes important late in the evolution of the binary .",
    "prior to that time , the evolution is dominated by interactions between the binary and surrounding material , either stars or gas .",
    "these interactions are very complex , due to the fact that the surroundings themselves evolve due to their interaction with the binary .",
    "( see milosavljevi & merritt 2001 for a recent discussion of stellar interactions . ) as we noted above , it is not yet clear whether these interactions are sufficient to harden the binary to a point where gravitational radiation then causes it to merge .",
    "the scenario we wish to explore in this paper is one where the binary s semimajor axis evolution has stalled because of insufficient interactions with surrounding material , and where a subsequent galaxy merger then introduces a third black hole in the system .",
    "we envisage the third black hole eventually forming a bound , hierarchical triple with the binary .",
    "the tidal gravitational torques exerted on the inner binary by the outer black hole can alter the eccentricity of the inner binary , thereby affecting the rate of gravitational wave emission .",
    "general relativity causes periastron precession in the inner binary , with a period @xmath14 provided this general relativistic precession is unimportant , and the outer black hole is in a sufficiently inclined orbit around the inner binary , then the eccentricity of the inner binary will oscillate by the kozai mechanism .",
    "the characteristic time scale for these oscillations is given by ( e.g. holman , touma , & tremaine 1997 ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the third body and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the semimajor axis and eccentricity , respectively , of its orbit around the inner binary .",
    "general relativistic precession can stop these eccentricity oscillations by destroying the kozai resonance ( e.g. holman et al .",
    "1997 ) . a precise criterion for this not to happen",
    "is easily derived ( see equation [ [ a2cubed ] ] in appendix ) : and factors of order unity , this is roughly equivalent to @xmath19 . equation ( [ a2a1 ] ) provides a more quantitatively accurate description of the behavior seen in our numerical results . ]",
    "@xmath20 the outer black hole must therefore come quite close to the inner binary for eccentricity oscillations to take place , although the triple is still hierarchical in the sense that the semimajor axis ratio @xmath21 is large .",
    "interactions with the surrounding stars and gas may cause the outer black hole s semimajor axis to evolve significantly over the merger time scale of the inner binary , a point to which we shall return in section 5 below . for now , however , we will neglect this fact and consider the evolution of an isolated , hierarchical black hole triple .",
    "as we will show , once the outer black hole is sufficiently close that equation ( [ a2a1 ] ) is satisfied , the merger time of the inner binary drops substantially for sufficiently high mutual inclinations .",
    "we assume that the triple is hierarchical , so that the orbit of the outer black hole is much larger in size than the orbit of the inner binary . in this case",
    "the triple can be considered to consist of two binaries in approximately keplerian orbits : the inner binary consisting of black holes with masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; and the outer binary consisting of the center of mass of the inner binary , with mass @xmath22 , and the third black hole with mass @xmath16 .",
    "let the semimajor axes of the inner and outer binaries be @xmath9 and @xmath17 , respectively , and the eccentricities be @xmath10 and @xmath18 .",
    "we also define @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be the corresponding arguments of periastron .",
    "the magnitude of the angular momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the inner and outer binaries are given by @xmath27^{1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath28^{1/2}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath29 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "let the total orbital angular momentum of the triple be @xmath30 . in the absence of gravitational radiation , tidal torques , or gravitational interactions with surrounding stars , this vector would be rigorously conserved .",
    "let @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) be the inclination of the inner ( outer ) binary , i.e. the angle between @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34 and @xmath35 the mutual inclination angle between the two binaries is @xmath36 .",
    "marchal ( 1990 ) , krymolowski & mazeh ( 1999 ) and ford , kozinsky , & rasio ( 2000 ) have derived the orbit - averaged hamiltonian of an isolated , newtonian hierarchical triple of point masses , using secular perturbation theory to octupole order , i.e. to order @xmath37 .",
    "we adopt the equations of motion for the orbital elements of ford et al . here , resulting from the canonical transformation of the von zeipel method .",
    "we have corrected a sign error in the octupolar terms in the equations of motion of ford et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in equations ( 22 ) and ( 29)-(32 ) of their paper , all terms involving @xmath38 should have the opposite sign .",
    "the equations of motion of krymolowski & mazeh ( 1999 ) also contain the same sign error . ] but modify them to incorporate two general relativistic effects on the inner binary : the precession of periastron and gravitational radiation .",
    "we do this by simply adding orbit - averaged general relativistic correction terms to the ford et al .",
    "( 2000 ) equations of motion for the orbital elements of the inner binary , the same correction terms which would exist if the inner binary were isolated .",
    "we must also take into account the fact that @xmath33 is no longer conserved because of the radiative loss @xmath39 of the inner binary s orbital angular momentum .",
    "we do this by noting that in the absence of interactions between the inner and outer binaries , gravitational radiation acts to change the magnitude of @xmath25 , but not its direction .",
    "in addition , the vector @xmath26 remains unchanged .",
    "the resulting equation is @xmath40    note that if the black holes are spinning , then the orbital plane of the inner binary can also evolve because of general relativistic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this is a higher order effect than general relativistic precession , and we neglect it entirely , assuming that we are essentially dealing with schwarzschild black holes .",

    "the terms in the equations of motion which remain after setting @xmath61 are the general relativistic correction terms .",
    "the last term in equation ( [ dg1dt ] ) is the general relativistic precession term , and the terms involving the speed of light @xmath62 in equations ( [ da1dt ] ) , ( [ de1dt ] ) , and ( [ dhdt ] ) are the gravitational radiation terms",
    ".    we may immediately deduce some important features of our evolution equations .",
    "equations ( [ de1dt ] ) and ( [ de2dt ] ) imply that if both the inner and outer binaries are circular ( @xmath63 ) , then they will remain that way .",
    "an eccentric outer binary will produce a nonzero eccentricity in an initially circular inner binary , and vice - versa , but only because of the octupole interaction terms .",
    "note that if we switch off the quadrupole and octupole interaction terms by setting @xmath61 , then an immediate consequence is @xmath64 , as may be verified by differentiating equation ( [ eqtheta ] ) directly .",
    "in other words , general relativistic effects alone do not change the mutual inclination of the inner and outer binaries if there are no interactions between them .",
    "this is as one would expect , given our treatment of the gravitational wave angular momentum loss in equation ( [ eqdhrad ] ) .",
    "our evolution equations also exhibit an important scaling .",
    "if all masses and all initial semimajor axes are multiplied by some constant factor , then the merger time and all other time scales change by the same multiplicative factor .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the nature of gravity , where mass , length , and time have the same dimensions in units where @xmath65 , and it reduces the parameter space of masses and semimajor axes which need to be explored numerically .",
    "another similarly useful fact is that the equations are unchanged when @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the inner binary are interchanged and @xmath23 or @xmath24 is increased by @xmath66 .",
    "the former corresponds to a relabeling of the inner binary black holes , while the latter represents a spatial inversion of the two orbits .",
    "while our implementation of the general relativistic effects has been heuristic , the general relativistic precession terms for the inner binary can in fact be rigorously justified by orbit - averaging the post - newtonian hamiltonian . to octupole order ,",

    "\\label{hamav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a rigorous derivation of the radiation terms would be considerably more difficult , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we believe that our equations of motion will capture the overall time evolution of the inner binary , because the early phases of this evolution will be dominated by interactions with the outer black hole , while the late phases will be dominated by gravitational radiation . in both those limits our evolution equations for the orbital elements of the inner binary are rigorously correct .",
    "it is possible , however , that interesting effects may occur during the transition between these two phases of evolution , which may not be captured by our equations .    in the absence of gravitational radiation ,",
    "our equations conserve the orbit averaged hamiltonian in equation ( [ hamav ] ) .",
    "we use this fact to check the accuracy of our numerical integrations .",
    "the reader should bear in mind that our equations are based on orbit averaging and an expansion in the semimajor axis ratio @xmath68 , and may therefore be inaccurate when this ratio is not very small .",
    "we will show in the next section that the octupole terms usually have fairly small effects on the merger time of the inner binary .",
    "hence our neglect of even higher order terms , and our use of such an expansion in the first place , is probably justified for the primary purpose of this paper .",
    "the major exception to this is the issue of stability .",
    "we are investigating whether the presence of a third black hole can cause the inner binary to merge before the third black hole comes close enough to cause an unstable interaction .",
    "there is a limit to how small @xmath21 can be for the triple to be stable and for the evolution we calculate to be valid .",
    "completely general stability criteria for hierarchical triples in arbitrary initial configurations do not exist .",
    "we adopt as a stability criterion the empirical formula used by mardling & aarseth ( 2001 ) , which may be written as @xmath69^{2/5}. \\label{eqacrit}\\ ] ] this criterion was derived for newtonian coplanar prograde orbits of the inner and outer binaries .",
    "inclined orbits , which are the major focus of this paper , are expected to be more stable , so inequality ( [ eqacrit ] ) provides a conservative stability limit .",
    "this inequality is also conservative in the sense that it is either close to or above the more complicated stability criterion proposed by eggleton & kiseleva ( 1995 ) , which was empirically verified over a wide range of mass ratios including nearly all those we numerically investigate in the next section .",
    "all the calculations we present in this paper are done for systems which are stable according to inequality ( [ eqacrit ] ) .",
    "the stability criterion ( [ eqacrit ] ) may be combined with the constraint of inequality ( [ a2a1 ] ) that general relativistic precession not destroy the kozai resonance to give a lower limit on the inner semimajor axis for which the kozai mechanism can reduce the inner binary merger time .",
    "the result is @xmath70 a stable triple with initial conditions such that the inner semimajor axis @xmath9 violates this inequality will not have an accelerated inner binary merger by the kozai mechanism .",
    "however , in that case @xmath9 is so small that the binary merger time by equation ( [ tmerge ] ) is @xmath71 at least for roughly equal mass triples and outer eccentricities that are not too high , this implies that the inner binary would already be rapidly merging and needs no help from the kozai mechanism .    on the other hand , equations ( [ a1crit ] ) and ( [ tmcrit ] )",
    "have a rather strong dependence on @xmath18 , so if the outer black hole s orbit is _ very _ eccentric , then the resulting triple may be too unstable for there to be time for the kozai mechanism to operate . however , numerical simulations of black hole binary evolution by milosavljevi & merritt ( 2001 ) suggest that this is rather unlikely .",
    "they find rather modest initial eccentricities when the binary first forms , and the subsequent evolution of the binary does not go to very high eccentricity .",
    "hence there is probably plenty of parameter space for stable hierarchical triples to form and evolve under the kozai mechanism .",
    "we have numerically integrated equations ( [ da1dt])-([dhdt ] ) for a wide range of possible black hole masses and initial conditions . even for fixed black hole masses ,",
    "the parameter space of possible initial conditions is huge , and it helps to understand which are the most important quantities affecting the merger time .",
    "we therefore focus first on the detailed evolution of a particular triple consisting of nearly equal mass black holes .",
    "specifically , we consider an inner binary with a @xmath72  m@xmath73 black hole and a @xmath74  m@xmath73 black hole , about which orbits another @xmath74  m@xmath73 black hole ten times further out .",
    "we have purposely chosen the two inner black holes to have different masses so as to allow for octupole interaction effects in the evolution .",
    "figure 1 depicts the evolution of inner semimajor axis @xmath9 , inner eccentricity @xmath10 , and outer eccentricity @xmath18 for a particular choice of initial conditions .",
    "the inner binary starts out nearly circular ( @xmath75 ) with a semimajor axis which would give a gravitational wave merger time @xmath76  yr if the binary were isolated .",
    "however , the presence of the outer black hole induces large amplitude eccentricity oscillations in the inner binary through the kozai mechanism .",
    "the time spent at higher eccentricity reduces the gravitational wave merger time of the two inner black holes by roughly a factor thirty for the particular case shown .",
    "in contrast to @xmath10 , the outer eccentricity @xmath18 stays close to its original value throughout the evolution .",
    "equation ( [ de2dt ] ) shows that @xmath18 only changes as a result of octupole interactions , which are weaker than the quadrupolar interactions driving the inner binary eccentricity oscillations .",
    "the lack of strong evolution in the outer eccentricity is a generic feature of all the numerical calculations we have done , implying that @xmath18 is unlikely to be driven to high enough values to destabilize an isolated triple .",
    "as might be expected , the merger time turns out to be rather insensitive to the initial orientation of the roughly circular inner orbit , i.e. the initial value of the inner argument of periastron @xmath23 .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the same triple as depicted in figure 1 , except that the initial value of @xmath23 has been shifted by @xmath77 .",
    "this results in a merger time which is about seven percent longer than that shown in figure 1 .    the overall behavior of the eccentricity oscillations depicted in figures 1(b ) and 2(b )",
    "can be understood by examining the evolution in the @xmath10 vs. @xmath23 phase space .",
    "the initial phase space trajectories for triples with the same total angular momentum as the triples of figures 1 and 2 are depicted in figure 3 .",
    "depending on the initial conditions , the evolution in @xmath23 is either one of libration about @xmath78 or @xmath79 , or one of circulation .",
    "the quadrupolar fixed point of the kozai resonance lies inside the smallest libration contour at @xmath80 .",
    "the only difference between the triples of figures 1 and 2 is that the former starts off circulating while the latter starts off librating .",
    "figure 4 depicts snapshots of the phase space trajectories during the course of the evolution shown in figures 1 and 2 . as shown in figure 4(b ) , gravitational radiation drives an initially librating inner binary over into a circulating inner binary , thereby causing the minimum eccentricity to drop until it crosses the separatrix .",
    "this separatrix crossing corresponds to the momentary zero eccentricity spike just before @xmath81  years in figure 2(b ) .",
    "thereafter , the evolution is very similar to the case where the inner binary starts off circulating : the minimum eccentricity rises until gravitational radiation becomes so strong that it starts to circularize the orbit .",
    "figure 5 shows the overall dependence of the merger time for varying initial inner argument of periastron @xmath23 , again for an inner orbit which is initially roughly circular : @xmath75 .",
    "while the overall effect of @xmath23 on the merger time is not too great , the exact value of the merger time is extremely sensitive to the initial value of @xmath23 for triples close to the libration / circulation separatrix , or for those triples which start out librating ( @xmath23 initially around @xmath77 or @xmath79 ) and therefore subsequently cross the separatrix . as shown in figure 3 , the region near the separatrix is chaotic , and this chaos arises from the octupole interaction terms .",
    "if these terms are neglected , the system then lacks the necessary degrees of freedom to exhibit chaos , and the dependence of the merger time on the initial value of @xmath23 is much smoother ( the dashed line in figure 5 ) .",
    "note that the separatrix is associated with passing through very small values of @xmath10 [ cf .",
    "figure 2(b ) ] .",
    "one might therefore worry that our results suffer from numerical problems associated with the @xmath82 singularity in the octupole term of equation ( [ dg1dt ] ) .",
    "however , following the suggestion of ford et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we have removed this singularity in our numerical integrations by first transforming the dependent variables from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the hamiltonian , equation ( [ hamav ] ) , is completely smooth through the separatrix crossing , changing only as a result of gravitational radiation losses .",
    "we therefore believe the `` noise '' exhibited in figure 5 is physical , and is caused by chaotic behavior during evolution through the separatrix .",
    "the initial orientation of the inner orbit affects the merger time much more substantially when the inner orbit is more eccentric .",
    "figure 6 depicts the merger time as a function of the initial inner eccentricity @xmath10 for two values of the initial inner argument of periastron : @xmath85 and @xmath77 .",
    "the former case corresponds to a circulating inner binary which starts out with an eccentricity which is at the minimum in the kozai oscillation ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "hence in this case the kozai mechanism _",
    "always _ speeds up the merger compared to the time @xmath86 it would take an isolated binary with the same initial eccentricity to merge . in contrast ,",
    "inner binaries with initial @xmath78 start at the minimum in the kozai eccentricity oscillation for values of @xmath10 which are below the kozai fixed point , and at the maximum for values of @xmath10 above it .",
    "we would therefore expect the kozai mechanism to reduce the merger time in the former case and increase it in the latter .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by the behavior shown in figure 6 , provided the binary does not start out too near the kozai fixed point which occurs at @xmath87 for this set of triples with fixed mutual inclination angles . near the kozai fixed point , the merger time is generally increased by the kozai mechanism , due perhaps to the fact that gravitational radiation drives the eccentricity at the kozai fixed point down to lower values with time .",
    "we therefore conclude that the kozai mechanism always acts to reduce the merger time of an initially nearly circular binary , but for eccentric inner binaries it will either reduce or increase the merger time , depending on the orientation of the inner binary within the triple system .",
    "the @xmath78 curve in figure 6 exhibits the chaos we typically find for inner binaries which start out librating , or circulating near the separatrix .",
    "this chaos is also present at the lowest values of eccentricity @xmath10 in the @xmath85 curve , as the inner binary then starts out in the chaotic zone shown in figure 3 .",
    "we turn now to the effects of the orientation and eccentricity of the outer binary on the merger time of the inner binary .",
    "equations ( [ dg1dt])-([de1dt ] ) and ( [ eqc2])-([eqc3 ] ) show that increasing the eccentricity @xmath18 of the outer binary at fixed semimajor axis @xmath17 strengthens both the quadrupolar and octupolar interaction terms , with the latter being enhanced over the former .",
    "this is of course physically reasonable as the distance of closest approach of the outer black hole with the inner binary is smaller . on the other hand , the outer argument of periastron",
    "@xmath24 only affects the evolution of the inner binary through the octupolar interaction terms . we would therefore expect that increasing @xmath18 would generally decrease the merger time through the ( quadrupolar ) kozai mechanism , but that the initial value of @xmath24 could modify this significantly at high eccentricity due to the enhanced octupolar effects .",
    "these expectations are confirmed by our numerical calculations shown in figure 7 .",
    "note , however , that the effects of @xmath18 and @xmath24 are not that large , at least for this particular triple .",
    "we have therefore chosen to fix their initial values to be @xmath88 and @xmath89 for all our other numerical calculations .",
    "perhaps the most important initial condition parameters affecting the inner binary merger time are the semimajor axes @xmath9 and @xmath17 and the mutual inclination of the inner and outer orbits . figure 8 shows the dependence of the merger time on the semimajor axis ratio @xmath21 for triples with fixed initial inclination @xmath90 ( the same as in all previous figures ) and various values of the initial inner semimajor axis @xmath9 . for large initial semimajor axis ratios @xmath21 ( to the right of the dashed line in figure 8) , general relativistic precession destroys the kozai resonance and the eccentricity of the inner binary is largely unaffected by the outer black hole .",
    "the merger time in this case is then the same as that of an isolated binary , and is given by equation ( [ tmerge ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the outer black hole comes sufficiently close ( to the left of the dashed line in figure 8) , then the kozai resonance exists and substantial reduction in the merger time occurs as a result of eccentricity oscillations .",
    "the equation for the dashed line itself which separates these two regimes comes from using the binary merger time in equation ( [ tmerge ] ) as a proxy for the inner semimajor axis @xmath9 , and employing equation ( [ a2a1 ] ) : @xmath91    figure 9 shows how the variation of merger time with initial semimajor axis ratio depends on the initial mutual inclination angle of the triple for initial @xmath92  pc .",
    "as expected , significant reduction in the merger time can only occur when the initial inclination is high enough that the kozai resonance is present : @xmath93 . if this criterion is satisfied , then values of @xmath21 satisfying equation ( [ a2a1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath94 for this particular triple , will exhibit accelerated mergers , with higher inclinations showing the fastest merger times . as miller & hamilton ( 2002 ) point out for the stellar mass case , retrograde triples ( @xmath95 ) generally produce faster merger times , at least for nearly equal masses .",
    "as we noted above in section 3 , our numerical results for the nearly equal mass triples of the previous subsection can be scaled to all triples with the same mass ratio , @xmath96 , provided the initial semimajor axes are scaled by the same factor as the masses .",
    "the merger time then scales by exactly the same factor .",
    "we have also investigated triples consisting of substantially unequal masses , and our results may also be scaled to other , similar mass ratio triples in the same manner .",
    "figure 10 depicts the merger time for the same inner binary as shown in figure 8 , but with different outer black hole masses .",
    "all cases shown start with an initial inner semimajor axis of @xmath92  pc , for which the merger time would be @xmath97  yr if the binary were isolated .",
    "because we do not account for gravitational wave losses associated with the outer binary , all the calculations shown in the figure have @xmath21 large enough so that the nominal gravitational wave merger time of the outer binary from equation ( [ tmerge ] ) is at least ten times longer than that of the inner binary .",
    "the @xmath98  m@xmath73 curve shows that an outer black hole with a much smaller mass than that of the inner binary does not have a substantial effect on the merger time of that binary . on the other hand ,",
    "a larger outer black hole mass exerts a stronger tidal perturbation on the inner binary .",
    "this reduces the merger time significantly compared to the nearly equal mass case , and also does it at larger semimajor axis ratios . in agreement with equation ( [ a2a1 ] ) ,",
    "the value of @xmath21 required for the onset of the kozai resonance scales with the outer black hole mass as @xmath99 .",
    "triples in which the outer black hole mass is much larger than that of the inner binary might arise from the merger of a smaller galaxy containing a stalled binary with a larger galaxy containing a bigger black hole .",
    "figure 11 presents a more detailed look at the dependence of the merger time on the semimajor axes @xmath9 and @xmath17 for the case of an outer black hole mass of @xmath100  m@xmath73 . with the exception of the larger outer black hole mass , the initial triple parameters are identical to those of figure 8 .",
    "note the change in scales on the axes : the larger outer black hole mass greatly reduces the merger time at much larger values of @xmath21 .",
    "the dashed line comes once again from equation ( [ eqdash ] ) , and separates the region on the left where the kozai resonance exists from that on the right where relativistic periastron precession destroys the resonance .",
    "figure 12 shows results for a substantially unequal mass inner binary consisting of @xmath101 and @xmath74  m@xmath73 black holes , in a triple with an outer @xmath101  m@xmath73 black hole .",
    "we choose initial inner semimajor axes @xmath9 to be ten times larger than those of figures 8 and 11 so that @xmath86 is roughly the same .",
    "very substantial reductions in the merger time occur once again , but for semimajor axis ratios @xmath21 that are even smaller than in the roughly equal mass case .",
    "larger outer black hole masses can expand this range of @xmath21 ( see equation [ [ a2a1 ] ] ) , but would also accelerate the gravitational wave merger of the outer binary , increasing the likelihood of an unstable encounter .",
    "we have only shown results here for prograde orbits in triples with substantially unequal masses .",
    "in contrast to the nearly equal mass case , retrograde orbits do not produce merger times which are very different from their prograde counterparts .",
    "this asymmetry between prograde and retrograde orbits arises from terms in the equations of motion which depend on odd powers of @xmath56 , which are neglected in the usual kozai approximation ( see appendix a ) .",
    "these terms are also very small for the unequal mass cases we have calculated here .",
    "we have shown that in cases where a bound hierarchical black hole triple forms , substantial reductions in the gravitational wave merger time of the inner binary can take place for reasonably large ranges of initial conditions of the triple .",
    "for example , figure 9 shows that for a triple consisting of nearly equal mass black holes , the merger time can be reduced by more than a factor of ten in over fifty percent of all cases , provided the mutual inclination angle is randomly distributed in solid angle .",
    "however , we have not addressed the issue of what the distribution of initial conditions is likely to be , as that would entail following the dynamical formation of the triple itself by interactions with the surrounding stars and gas . as we have shown in the previous section ,",
    "all the initial parameters of the triple affect whether and by how much the merger of the inner binary is altered by the presence of the outer black hole . however , the most important are the mutual inclination angle @xmath102 and the semimajor axes @xmath9 and @xmath17 .",
    "there is very little effect on the merger time of the inner binary unless the semimajor axis ratio @xmath21 is small enough that general relativistic precession does not destroy the kozai resonance ( equation [ [ a2a1 ] ] ) .",
    "an issue related to the uncertainty in initial conditions is the fact that we have not considered the evolution of the semimajor axis of the outer black hole due either to interactions with surrounding material or to gravitational radiation .",
    "the latter is not significant for the calculations shown here , as we have always chosen @xmath21 and @xmath18 to be such that the gravitational wave evolution time scale of the outer black hole is much longer than the merger time scale of the inner binary .",
    "note that @xmath18 evolves purely due to octupolar interactions ( equation [ [ de2dt ] ] ) , and generally does not undergo the dramatic changes that @xmath10 exhibits .",
    "hence we do not expect dramatic reductions in the _",
    "binary merger time scale due to interactions with the inner binary .",
    "however , that still leaves open the issue of whether the inner binary will merge before interactions with surrounding material cause the outer black hole to come sufficiently close that an unstable three body encounter occurs .",
    "it would be interesting to follow the evolution of the triple by including the time dependence of @xmath17 starting at large enough values that the kozai resonance is destroyed by general relativistic periastron precession .",
    "in addition to the kozai mechanism , the presence of a third black hole may affect the merger time scale of the inner binary in other ways .",
    "in particular , being bound in a triple forces the inner binary to `` wander '' through space , albeit in a regular orbit rather than a stochastic trajectory .",
    "this may enhance the binary s interactions with surrounding stars beyond what it would have had if the outer black hole were not present , and therefore the hardening rate might be increased .",
    "eccentricity oscillations in the inner binary may be induced by other sources of tidal gravitational fields besides that of an orbiting outer black hole , e.g. nearby matter inhomogeneities or an aspherical distribution of surrounding stars and gas . in order to beat general relativistic periastron precession ,",
    "equation ( [ a2cubed ] ) implies that the quadrupole moment @xmath103 of these exterior matter distributions must satisfy @xmath104 note that this critical quadrupole moment has a strong scaling with the binary semimajor axis @xmath9 , and it may be possible to achieve given the actual stellar mass densities observed in galactic nuclei ( e.g. faber et al . 1997 ) .",

    "we neglect the octupole terms in the hierarchical triple evolution equations ( [ da1dt])-([dhdt ] ) throughout this section .",

    "general relativistic precession is itself circulation in @xmath23 , so general relativity would be expected to reduce the parameter space where librations exist .",
