    "the schwinger effect @xcite is the pair production of electron and positron in quantum electro dynamics ( qed ) in the presence of a strong external electric field .",
    "this is known as a non - perturbative phenomenon .",
    "the production rate is computed under weak - field and weak - coupling conditions @xcite , and then it is computed only by a weak - field approximation @xcite ( for the monopole production , see @xcite ) .",
    "the pair production is not restricted to qed , but ubiquitous in quantum field theories coupled to an abelian gauge field .",
    "pairs of virtual particle and anti - particle momentarily created in the vacuum must gain energy more than the total static mass so as to be real particles . this process is described as a tunneling phenomenon with the potential , @xmath0 here the first term is the total static mass and then the second is the energy coming from an external electric field @xmath1 .",
    "finally the third is the coulomb potential with the fine - structure constant @xmath2 .",
    "the potential barrier decreases gradually as the electric field becomes stronger , and at last it vanishes at a certain value of the electric field @xmath3 .",
    "this value is called the critical electric field , above which there is no potential barrier and the system becomes unstable catastrophically .",
    "a motive is to understand the critical electric field in the context of string theory @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite provides a nice laboratory @xcite .",
    "semenoff and zarembo recently proposed a holographic setup to study the schwinger effect @xcite . in this setup , the system is the @xmath4 @xmath5 super yang - mills theory and the gauge group @xmath4 is broken to @xmath6 by the higgs mechanism .",
    "a probe d3-brane is put at an intermediate position in the bulk ads space and the mass of the fundamental particles ( called `` quarks '' ) is finite . at large @xmath7 and large t  hooft coupling @xmath8",
    ", the production rate of quarks with mass @xmath9 is estimated as @xcite @xmath10   \\ , , \\qquad e_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{2\\pi m^2}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is the critical electric field and agrees with the result obtained from the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action . for generalizations of this setup to the case with magnetic fields and the finite temperature case , see @xcite .",
    "we have revisited the agreement of the critical electric field from the viewpoint of the potential analysis @xcite .",
    "the probe d3-brane is put at an intermediate position between the horizon and the boundary in the ads space , as in @xcite . then the quark anti - quark potential is computed from the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a rectangular wilson loop on the probe d3-brane by slightly generalizing the methods in @xcite . with this quark anti - quark potential , we have shown that the critical electric field agrees with @xmath12 .",
    "this potential analysis is quite a powerful tool because the computation of the vev of a rectangular wilson loop is much easier than that of a circular wilson loop @xcite .",
    "hence the potential analysis is applicable to a wide class of systems .",
    "a good example is ads solitons @xcite which lead to confinement . for the confining backgrounds",
    ", we have shown that there is another critical value of the electric field @xcite .",
    "when the electric field is smaller than this value , the schwinger effect does not occur .",
    "it is quite interesting to consider general arguments for the critical electric fields . in this paper",
    "we will carry out the potential analysis for general backgrounds and discuss two kinds of the critical electric field .",
    "the first is the critical electric field for the catastrophic decay .",
    "it universally exists under some conditions for the backgrounds and agrees with the dbi action .",
    "this is a generalization of @xcite to a certain class of holographic backgrounds .",
    "the second is the one , below which the schwinger effect does not occur , in general confining backgrounds .",
    "the sufficient conditions for confining backgrounds are elaborated in @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) . under the conditions , the critical electric field universally exists .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we consider the critical electric field for the catastrophic decay in general backgrounds under some conditions . in section 3 ,",
    "we first introduce the theorem to specify confining backgrounds . for concreteness , two examples are explained .",
    "then we discuss the critical electric field below which the schwinger effect does not occur .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "we will consider the critical electric field concerning with the catastrophic vacuum decay in general supergravity backgrounds which are constructed basically from d@xmath13-branes and admit the holographic interpretation .",
    "let us first introduce the setup for our argument .",
    "we are concerned with type iib and iia supergravity solutions obtained by taking the near - horizon limit of d@xmath13-brane backgrounds and their generalizations , for which a holographic interpretation is possible .",
    "we assume the diagonal metric for the d@xmath13-brane world - volume with time @xmath14 and spatial directions @xmath15 . the existence of the radial direction @xmath16 is also supposed to perform the holographic analysis , where @xmath17 is the position of the horizon or the infrared boundary for ads solitons . for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that each component of the metric depends only on @xmath18 . thus the metric of the background in ten dimensions is basically given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the metric of the internal space in @xmath21 dimensions .    the location @xmath17 is basically fixed as a zero point of @xmath22 in the usual brane setup . for ads soliton cases @xmath17 is given as a zero point of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the compactified direction .",
    "let us next consider the classical solution of the string world - sheet ending on a probe d - brane located at @xmath25 .",
    "we will work in the euclidean signature below .",
    "the nambu - goto ( ng ) action is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the string world - sheet coordinates .",
    "we are concerned with the potential between a quark and an anti - quark separated in the @xmath28-direction . for this purpose , it is convenient to take the static gauge , @xmath29 where @xmath28 is one of the non - compact spatial directions along the d - brane world - volume .",
    "the radial direction of the classical solution is supposed to depend only on @xmath30 , @xmath31 under this ansatz , the analysis is drastically simplified .    using the spacetime metric ,",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath32 where we have introduced functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 defined as , respectively , @xmath35 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are assumed to be real , smooth and non - negative so that the lagrangian is well defined . for a holographic interpretation , we suppose a further condition that @xmath33 is a monotonically increasing function .",
    "this condition indicates that the string solution should extend towards the horizon , as we will see later .",
    "now that the resulting lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) depends only on @xmath30 , the hamiltonian is a conserved quantity with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "hence the following relation is obtained , @xmath36 by imposing the boundary condition , @xmath37 the constant term in ( [ const ] ) can be fixed as @xmath38 and the differential equation is derived , @xmath39 then the distance @xmath28 between a quark and an anti - quark is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the position of a probe d - brane .",
    "assume that the above integral is finite .",
    "for the geometric relation of the parameters , see figure [ ads - soliton : fig ] .    ]    in the usual case , the probe d - brane is located near the boundary , namely @xmath42 .",
    "then the mass of `` quark '' is infinitely heavy .",
    "however , to discuss the pair production in a more realistic setup , the mass should be kept finite and hence the probe d - brane should be put at an intermediate position in the bulk space @xcite .",
    "now that @xmath41 takes a finite value , the quark mass is given by @xmath43 this describes the energy of a string stretched between the horizon and the probe d - brane .    on the other hand , for the backgrounds that admit a holographic interpretation , the probe d - brane should be able to be sent to the boundary , in principle .",
    "so we assume that the distance @xmath28 in ( [ x ] ) should be finite as a consistency of the background when the @xmath44 limit is taken .",
    "a sufficient condition for this is given by @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a certain constant satisfying @xmath47 .",
    "it is easy to show the following inequalities , @xmath48 then , by multiplying @xmath49 and integrating from @xmath46 to @xmath50 , the following integral @xmath51 is shown to be finite due to the condition ( [ finite ] ) . with ( [ f - int ] ) , one can see that @xmath28 is finite when @xmath41 is sent to @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , the condition ( [ finite ] ) ensures the finiteness of the distance @xmath28 for an arbitrary mass , so that the quark and anti - quark potential can definitely be defined .",
    "although it seems unnecessary to take care of heavy mass in studying the schwinger effect , the pair creation may occur even for heavy particles in principle and we suppose the condition ( [ finite ] ) for completeness .",
    "according to the conventional ads / cft dictionary , the area of the string world - sheet ending on a rectangular wilson loop leads to the sum of the quark anti - quark potential energy ( pe ) and the static energy ( se ) .",
    "this is also the case when the probe d - brane is located at an intermediate position @xmath25 , rather than near the boundary .",
    "the resulting potential is given by @xmath52      we shall evaluate the critical electric field by turning on a constant ns - ns two form @xmath53 . by rewriting , the total potential @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 where we have introduced a dimensionless quantity @xmath56 , @xmath57 one can show that the total potential vanishes at @xmath58 ( @xmath3 ) and exhibits the critical behavior .",
    "the proof is straightforward .",
    "all we have to do is to show that @xmath59 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath28 and negative definite .",
    "then the second term in ( [ tot ] ) does not lift up the potential barrier and whether the potential barrier vanishes or not is relevant only to the first term in ( [ tot ] ) . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the potential barrier exists , but it vanishes when @xmath61 . for @xmath62 , there is no barrier any more .",
    "it would be helpful to see the critical behavior from numerical plots of the total potential @xmath63 for fixed geometries . for @xmath64 and thermal @xmath64 , see figures 4 and 5 in @xcite , respectively . for ads",
    "solitons composed of d3-branes and d4-branes , see figures 2 and 3 in @xcite , respectively .",
    "let us then prove that @xmath65 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath28 and negative definite .",
    "the derivative of @xmath66 with respect to @xmath28 is written as @xmath67 and each part is given by , respectively , @xmath68 here a cutoff parameter @xmath69 has been introduced to regularize the integrals .",
    "a remarkable point is that the singular parts are canceled out in @xmath70 . because @xmath33 is a monotonically increasing function by assumption and @xmath71 ,",
    "the following inequality is obtained , @xmath72 because @xmath73  by definition , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 is shown to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath28 and negative definite .",
    "thus we have shown that @xmath11 is the critical value of @xmath1 .",
    "note that the existence of @xmath11 is universal for general backgrounds under the conditions supposed here and the value of @xmath11 depends only on a single function @xmath33 .",
    "let us here argue the critical electric field from the dbi action for a single d@xmath13-brane - brane ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "then the extra directions have to be wrapped on some non - trivial cycles in the internal manifold .",
    "after that , the analysis is similar . ] .",
    "we work in the lorentzian signature again .",
    "the ng part of the d@xmath13-brane action is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the d@xmath13-brane tension and the world - volume flux @xmath79 is turned on .",
    "when the probe d - brane is put at @xmath25 , it can be rewritten as @xmath80 from this expression , one can read off the critical electric field @xmath81 and it agrees with the critical value @xmath11 obtained by the potential analysis as follows : @xmath82 thus one can see the complete agreement of the critical electric field within a class of the gravitational backgrounds under the current consideration ( for concrete examples , see @xcite ) .",
    "this implies a universal behavior of the critical electric field .",
    "we consider here the critical electric field , below which the schwinger effect does not occur , for general confining backgrounds .",
    "we first give a brief review of the sufficient conditions for confining backgrounds argued in @xcite .",
    "then we discuss a universal behavior of the critical electric field under the conditions .",
    "let us first give a review of the theorem in @xcite .",
