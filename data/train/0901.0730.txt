    "without accurate knowledge of the collapsing process of an isolated dense cloud core , we can not understand how a low - mass protostar forms through the accretion process .",
    "one of the major limiting factors is that the initial conditions of core collapse are not necessarily revealed by observations in detail .",
    "there has been a long standing theoretical debate about the gravitational collapse process since the early 1970s .",
    "two extreme models of runaway collapse and quasi - static , inside - out collapse have been developed ; the former is originally proposed by the larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) and extended by hunter ( 1977 ) , and the latter by shu ( 1977 ) . in this paper , we refer to the runaway collapse scenario as the larson - penston - hunter ( lph ) solution by following the nomenclature in mckee & ostriker ( 2007 ) .",
    "the validity of these solutions has been observationally studied by e.g. , ward - thompson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and looney , mundy & welch ( 2003 ) .    in this context",
    ", we performed a detailed study of the natal cloud core harboring an extremely young low - mass protostar   ( furuya , kitamura & shinnaga 2006 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the protostar is believed not to have generated an extensive molecular outflow , yielding a rare opportunity to investigate core collapse conditions free from the disturbance by the outflow .",
    "we discussed that the observed velocity field of the core is consistent with the initial conditions assumed in the lph solution .",
    "the core shows a radial density profile of  and the entire core has non - thermal line widths of @xmath0 ( 23 ) , suggestive of gas infall motions (  is isothermal sound velocity ) . in order to shed light on the physical properties of the infall motions , we have carried out molecular line observations of the  core to detect the blueskewed profiles characterizing infall motion ( e.g. , walker et al .",

    "we have carried out on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping observations ( sawada et al . 2008 ) of the  @xmath310 line [ rest frequency ( @xmath4 ) = 89188.526mhz ] using the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45 m telescope in 2006 may .",
    "we used the 25 beam array receiver system ( bears ) , and configured auto - correlators ( acs ) as a backend , yielding an effective velocity resolution ( ) of 0.048  in the 8mhz bandwidth mode . at the line frequency , the mean beam size ( ) of the 25 beams was 186 , and the mean main - beam efficiency ( @xmath5 ) was 0.51 .",
    "all the spectra were calibrated by the standard chopper wheel method , and were converted into main - beam brightness temperature ( ) by dividing by @xmath5 .",
    "we adopted the correction factors provided by the observatory for gain differences between the 25 beams .",
    "the uncertainty in our intensity calibration is estimated to be @xmath015% .",
    "the otf mapping was carried out over an area with a size of @xmath0320 , employing position switching method .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 1.2 hrs , and was found to be accurate within 3 .",
    "the data reduction was done using the nostar package . by using a spheroidal function as a gridding convolution function",
    ", we produced a data cube with a spatial resolution of 206 and a pixel size of 5 .",
    "furthermore , in 2008 june , we have performed a single - point integration of the hcn ( 1 - 0 ) line toward the core center with the 45 m telescope .",
    "the beam size of the s80 receiver at the line frequency was 182 in hpbw , and @xmath5 was 0.44 .",
    "we used acousto - optical spectrometers ( aoss ) , aos - h , providing  of 0.13 .    in 2006 july , 2007 august , and 2008 june , we have used the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) 10.4 m telescope to observe the  @xmath332 transition ( @xmath6267557.633mhz ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath7 26  at 267ghz and estimated @xmath5 of @xmath8 from our measurements of jupiter .",
    "we configured the 50mhz band width aos , providing  of 0.055 .",
    "the  line was observed toward 3@xmath93 positions with a grid spacing of 30  centered on the  core center .",
    "the pointing accuracy was better than 3 , and the overall uncertainty in flux calibration was 30% .",
    "figure [ fig : sp ] shows molecular line spectra toward the  core center in unit of .",
    "all the spectra , except the  @xmath10 , are the single - dish spectra taken with position switching .",
    "the  ( 10 ) spectrum was produced from the data cube ( @xmath11 ) by convolving with a gaussian profile in order to have an effective spatial resolution of 26  in fwhm , which is equal to the cso beam size for the  ( 32 ) line .",
    "clearly , all the spectra show blueskewed profiles .",
    "the lsr - velocities of their deepest absorption agree with the systemic velocity ( ) of the cloud , @xmath12 , which was estimated from the optically thin  ( 10 ) and ccs @xmath13 lines ( paper i ) as well as  inversion lines at 23ghz ( furuya , kitamura & shinnaga 2008 ) .",
    "the velocities of the blueshifted peaks of the  ( 10 ) and ( 32 ) lines , @xmath14 are estimated to be @xmath15  and @xmath16 , respectively , from gaussian fitting .",
    "similarly , we obtained @xmath17   and @xmath18   for the redshifted peaks of the ( 10 ) and ( 32 ) transitions , respectively .",
    "the obtained  for both the transitions agree with each other , while the  values differ by 0.1  for the two transitions , suggesting that the velocity difference should be attributed to the intrinsic property of the gas rather than uncertainties in .",
    "the three hyperfine ( hf ) components of the hcn ( 10 ) emission , showing blueskewed profiles , have comparable peak intensities , suggestive of large optical depths .",
    "we have performed hfs analysis of the blue- and redshifted components separately assuming that infall motions traced by the blue- and redshifted emission are independent , and that each emission can be approximated by a gaussian profile .",
    "our analysis gave the representative lsr - velocity ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath20 , intrinsic velocity width ( ) of @xmath21 , and total optical depth ( ) of @xmath22 for the blueshifted components .",
    "similarly , we obtained @xmath23 ,  @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for the redshifted components .",
    "these  values lead to optical depths ( @xmath26 ) of 1.6 and 1.3 for the blue- and redshifted @xmath27 components , 8.1 and 6.7 for the @xmath28 components , and 4.9 and 4.0 for the @xmath29 components , respectively , with uncertainty of 20% .",
    "the estimated @xmath26 for the blue- and redshifted gas of each hf component are comparable to each other , as expected from their intensity ratios , and seem to be consistent with the fact that the absorption dips in the @xmath28 and @xmath30 transitions are deeper than that in the @xmath31 transition .",
    "figure [ fig : totmap ] compares total integrated intensity maps of the  ( 10 ) ( paper i ) and  ( 10 ) emission .",
    "both lines show a similar spatial structure , but the  emission is more extended than the . figure [ fig : pmap ] represents the  ( 32 ) and ( 10 ) mosaic spectra taken with 30  spacing . here , the ( 10 ) spectra were produced from the smoothed cube data in the same manner as for figure [ fig : sp ] .",
    "both the transitions show the blueskewed profiles not only toward the core center , but also at some surrounding positions of , e.g. , ( @xmath32 ) @xmath7 ( @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath34 ) . due to the limited s /",
    "n , it is difficult to assess whether or not the outer spectra ( e.g. , in the row of @xmath35 and the column of @xmath36 ) have blueskewed profiles . the  ( 10 ) emission show strong blueshifted emission toward the southwest , leaving a possibility that the emission represents another blueshifted component of the gas .",
    "in fact , the possibility is supported by position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams of the  ( 10 ) and  ( 10 ) emission shown in figure [ fig : pv ] .",
    "clearly , there exists an isolated blueshifted component of the  emission peaked at the offset position of @xmath37 ( figure [ fig : pv]a ) .",
    "it should be noted that the velocity structures in the central region of @xmath38 are fairly consistent with the blueskewed profiles expected for infall motion .",
    "although the nature of the blueshifted  emission to the southwest is not clear , our observations show that the gas motion in the central region ( @xmath38 ) is governed by the infall .",
    "therefore , we focus on the discussion of the spectrum toward the core center . to give more quantitative constraints on the gas infall , we have developed a radiative transfer code to model the h@xmath39co@xmath40 and  spectra for a spherical core dominated by infall motion .",
    "the code was originally written for the co emission from a protoplanetary disk ( omodaka , kitamura & kawazoe 1992 ) . in this model",
    ", we assumed that local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) holds for the line excitation . to calculate the spectra",
    ", we assumed that the gas is infalling with a constant velocity ( @xmath41 ) for @xmath42 30 , whereas a static state ( @xmath43 ) for 30@xmath44 100  from figures [ fig : totmap][fig : pv ] .",
    "we adopted the mass density radial profile reported in paper i : @xmath45 .",
    "we used a radial temperature profile of @xmath46k with @xmath47 , on the basis of the temperature profile at @xmath48 yr after the formation of a protostar in figure 2 by @xcite .",
    "we took a constant fractional abundance for  of @xmath49 ( paper i ) all over the core , although this simplification may not be valid in a dynamically collapsing core ( e.g. , aikawa et al . 2001 ) . for a comparison with the observed spectra , we smoothed the calculated ones with a gaussian function with  @xmath7 26  and converted the flux density into the   ( see omodaka et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mdl ] compares calculated and observed spectral profiles whose intensity scales are normalized . here",
    "we discuss only the velocity differences between the blue- and redshifted peaks because our calculations adopted the lte approximation , and because rigorous calculations @xcite show that the intensities of the model spectra significantly vary with the evolutionary stage of the protostar .",
    "we searched for a plausible value of  to reproduce the observed line profiles , and found that a velocity of 0.5  gives the most plausible h@xmath39co@xmath40 line profiles .",
    "in fact , the calculated h@xmath39co@xmath40 spectra have a reasonable consistency with the observed ones within the errors ( figure [ fig : mdl ] ) .",
    "we confirmed that the two cases of  @xmath7 0.3 and 0.7   can not reproduce the observed velocity differences between the blue- and redshifted peaks ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "notice that  @xmath7 0.5  agrees with an estimate from   @xmath51 0.45  in @xmath50 .",
    "although the model  line profile has the blue and red shoulders due to the central infalling region , the overall line profile seems agree with the observed one that has a single peak at  owing to the outer static gas . as for @xmath52",
    ", we also tried the two cases of @xmath53 1/3 and 1 , but found that both the @xmath52 values can not reproduce the observed absorption features around . here",
    ", the @xmath52 value of 1/3 is expected in the case that the dust opacity coefficient has the frequency dependence of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we addressed such a case because the overall properties of the dust in the  core , which is at a very early evolutionary stage , may be similar to those for the interstellar medium .",
    "in addition , the deep absorption dips around  require the presence of a cold static envelope surrounding the contracting region .",
    "it is known that a density profile of @xmath55 is expected for a central free - fall region onto the forming protostar .",
    "our previous observations revealed that the profile of @xmath56 continues down to the central @xmath57600au region , although it was impossible to know whether or not @xmath55 exists at @xmath58au owing to our insufficient angular resolution .",
    "given @xmath59 and  @xmath7 0.5 , we further calculated the  spectra for the case that the gas is freely falling onto the central protostar of 0.1  ( paper i ) at @xmath60 600 au .",
    "however , the resultant line profiles were not significantly changed compared with the above results .",
    "although the lph solution well describes the on - going collapse in the  core ( paper i ) , we examined a case for the shu s solution .",
    "we assumed that the gas is freely falling toward a 0.1  protostar at @xmath61600 au and is static at @xmath62au on the basis of the observed density profile ( paper i ) .",
    "the calculated  spectra for the two transitions do not show blueskewed profiles , but double - peaked spectra having an absorption dip at the .",
    "this would be a natural consequence by giving the compact free - fall region embedded in the large static core .",
    "assuming that the infall motion is radial , we can estimate the mass accretion rate @xmath63 by @xmath64 .",
    "we obtain @xmath63 of 2.5@xmath1  yr@xmath2 with uncertainty of a factor @xmath65 .",
    "since theoretical models of protostar formation ( e.g. , stahler , shu & tamm 1980 ; masunaga & inutsuka 2000a ) predict that the protostar radius , @xmath66 , should be @xmath67  for a low - mass protostar , we can calculate an accretion luminosity ( @xmath68 ) for the central protostar(s ) of @xmath69 ( r_{\\ast}/5\\rsun)^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this seems reasonable compared with the luminosity expected for a protostar at a very early evolutionary stage ( see e.g. , figure 7 in masunaga & inutsuka 2000a ) .",
    "consequently , our study confirms that the gas in the   core is infalling onto the protostar(s ) in the central region , and that the infalling velocity is consistent with the prediction from the lph solution .",
    "furthermore , we plan to perform deeper integration of these  lines to examine the presence of the infalling gas in the outer region of the core .",
