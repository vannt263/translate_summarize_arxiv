    "for nearly a century , optical observations aimed at the discovery and study of astrophysical transients have largely focused on events with durations of days to months .",
    "this is mainly due to a fortuitous match with the timescales of the most common extragalactic events ( novae and supernovae ) , whose typical luminosities and intrinsic rates require coverage of large numbers of galaxies and/or blank sky areas , leading to a natural search cadence of several days .",
    "thus , novae have a much higher intrinsic rate than supernovae ( @xmath28 yr@xmath12 per @xmath29 l@xmath30 versus @xmath31 yr@xmath12 per @xmath29 l@xmath30 , respectively ; e.g. , @xcite ) , but supernovae are significantly more luminous than novae ( @xmath32 mag versus @xmath33 mag , respectively ; @xcite ) . as a result , for a given survey limiting magnitude tens of novae can be discovered per year by targeting a few nearby galaxies with a cadence of few days , while discovering a similar number of supernovae requires monitoring of @xmath34 galaxies ( or hundreds of deg@xmath35 ) , thereby necessitating a similar cadence of several days ; for the purpose of sheer discovery rate , a faster cadence is not profitable for nova and supernova searches . over the past few decades",
    "such surveys have been highly successful at discovering about one hundred novae and supernovae per year ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of large format cameras on dedicated wide - field telescopes , coupled with serendipitous discoveries of transients outside of the traditional nova and supernova luminosity and timescale ranges , has opened up a new discovery space for astrophysical transients . by repeatedly targeting the same fields , such surveys are in principle capable of exploring a wide range of timescales , from the duration of single exposures ( i.e. , minutes ) to years . in practice , most surveys are still primarily focused on supernovae ( driven to a large extent by type ia supernova cosmology at increasingly larger redshifts ) , and therefore cover wider fields to greater depth at the expense of a faster temporal cadence to maximize the supernova discovery rate while preserving adequate light curve coverage . still , some surveys have been utilized to perform initial searches for fast optical transients ( fots ) on timescales as short as @xmath20 hr .",
    "clearly , the effective areal exposure of such searches ( i.e. , the product of survey area and exposure time ) becomes progressively smaller at faster cadence as sky coverage has to be sacrificed for repeated short - cadence observations .    in this context",
    ", the deep lens survey ( dls ) was utilized to search for fots on a timescale of about @xmath36 s to a depth of @xmath37 mag ( with a total exposure of 1.1 deg@xmath35 d ) and led to an upper limit on the extragalactic sky - projected rate of @xmath38 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 ( @xmath13 confidence level ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dls search uncovered three fast transients , which were shown to be flares from galactic m dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "a search for transients with a timescale of @xmath39 hr to a depth of about 17.5 mag ( with a total exposure of 635 deg@xmath35 d ) using the robotic optical transient search experiment - iii ( rotse - iii ) yielded a limit on the extragalactic rate of @xmath40 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 , and uncovered a single m dwarf flare @xcite ; a similar search with the master telescope system yielded comparable limits @xcite , and two uncharacterized candidate fast transients @xcite .",
    "similarly , a targeted search for transients on a timescale of about 0.5 hr and to a depth of @xmath41 mag in the fornax galaxy cluster ( with a total exposure of 1.9 deg@xmath35 d ) placed a limit on the extragalactic rate of @xmath42 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "two fast transients were detected in this search , both shown to be m dwarf flares @xcite . at the bright end ,",
    "the `` pi of the sky '' project placed a limit on transients brighter than 11 mag with a duration of @xmath43 s of @xmath44 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "fast optical transients have also been found serendipitously by other surveys , but they have generally been shown to be galactic in origin . a notable exception is the transient ptf11agg @xcite , which faded by about 1.2 mag in 5.3 hours , and 3.9 mag in 2.2 d , and was accompanied by radio emission that may be indicative of relativistic expansion ( although the distance of this transient is not known , thereby complicating its interpretation ) .",
    "we note that such an event , while fast compared to the general nova and supernova population , is still of longer duration than the timescales probed by the dls and fornax searches , as well as the pan - starrs1 search we describe here .",
    "thus , the existing searches for extragalactic fots have mainly raised the awareness that the foreground of m dwarf flares is large , with an estimated all - sky rate of @xmath45 yr@xmath12 at a limiting magnitude of @xmath46 mag @xcite .    here",
    ", we present a search for fast optical transients with an effective timescale of about 0.5 hr to 1 d and to a depth of about 22.5 mag in the first @xmath47 years of data from the pan - starrs1 medium - deep survey ( ps1/mds ) .",
    "this search uncovered a substantial sample of 19 fast transients , both with and without quiescent counterparts .",
    "we describe the survey strategy and selection criteria in  [ sec : obs ] . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we summarize the properties of the 19 detected transients and classify them using a combination of color information , astrometry , sky location , and the properties of quiescent counterparts ( when detected ) . with a unique identification of all 19 transients as solar system or galactic in origin , we place a limit on the rate of extragalactic fast transients that is @xmath15 times better than the limits from previous searches (  [ sec : rate ] ) .",
    "we further investigate for the first time the limits on the _ volumetric _ rates of fots from our survey and previous searches using the survey limiting magnitudes and fiducial transients luminosities . in ",
    "[ sec : models ] we expand on this point and discuss the expected peak luminosities of fots for a range of physically motivated models . finally ,",
    "since our search is the first one to utilize observations that are similar to the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) main survey strategy , we conclude by drawing implications for fast optical transient searches in the lsst data  [ sec : lsst ] .",
    "the ps1 telescope , located on mount haleakala , is a high - etendue wide - field survey instrument with a 1.8-m diameter primary mirror and a @xmath48 diameter field - of - view imaged by an array of sixty @xmath49 pixel detectors , with a pixel scale of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the observations are obtained through five broad - band filters ( @xmath1@xmath2@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 ) , with some differences relative to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ; the @xmath1  filter extends @xmath54   redward of @xmath55 to achieve greater sensitivity and lower systematics for photometric redshifts , while the @xmath52  filter terminates at @xmath56  , unlike @xmath57 which is defined by the detector response @xcite .",
    "ps1 photometry is in the `` natural '' system , @xmath58 , with a single zero - point adjustment ( @xmath59 ) in each band to conform to the ab magnitude scale .",
    "magnitudes are interpreted as being at the top of the atmosphere , with 1.2 airmasses of atmospheric attenuation included in the system response function @xcite .",
    "the ps1 medium - deep survey ( mds ) consists of 10 fields ( each with a single ps1 imager footprint ) observed on a nearly nightly basis by cycling through the five filters in @xmath60 nights to a typical @xmath61 depth of @xmath62 mag in @xmath1@xmath2@xmath51@xmath52 , and @xmath63 mag in @xmath53 .",
    "the mds images are processed through the image processing pipeline ( ipp ; @xcite ) , which includes flat - fielding ( `` de - trending '' ) , a flux - conserving warping to a sky - based image plane , masking and artifact removal , and object detection and photometry . for the fast transient search described here we produced difference images from the stacked nightly images using the photpipe pipeline @xcite running on the odyssey computer cluster at harvard university .      for the purpose of detecting fast optical transients",
    "we take advantage of the consecutive mds @xmath1@xmath2  observations , with eight @xmath64 s exposures in each filter providing a total time - span of about @xmath65 min for a full sequence .",
    "we carry out the search using the stacked @xmath1and @xmath2  images from each visit through image subtraction relative to deep multi - epoch templates , and subsequently utilize the individual exposures to construct light curves ; representative discovery and template images are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] and light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : lcs ] .",
    "we limit the timescale of the transients to @xmath66 d by further requiring no additional detections in the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath51@xmath52  filters on preceding and subsequent nights ( extending to @xmath67 nights ) . to ensure that this constraint is met",
    "we only perform our search on the subset of mds data for which consecutive nights of observations are available . in the first @xmath47 years of data we searched a total of 277 nights of @xmath1@xmath2  observations across the 10 mds fields , leading to a total areal exposure of 40.4 deg@xmath35 d for a timescale of 0.5 hr and 1940 deg@xmath35 d for a timescale of 1 d.    to select transients in the @xmath1@xmath2  difference images we utilize a signal - to - noise ratio threshold of @xmath68 , with resulting limiting magnitudes of @xmath69 mag and @xmath70 mag .",
    "we additionally require sources in the @xmath1@xmath2  difference images to astrometrically match within @xmath71 , corresponding to a 1.2 pixel radius around each detection ( this is about 6 times the typical astrometric error ; see  [ sec : asteroids ] ) . using these cuts",
    "we find a total of 227 candidates , which were visually inspected by one of us ( c.l . )",

    "the @xmath74 colors span a wide range of about @xmath75 to @xmath76 mag , but we stress that for transients that rapidly vary in brightness within the time - span of each observation ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) , the non - simultaneous @xmath1  and @xmath2measurements do not reflect the true instantaneous colors .    @xmath2@xmath51@xmath52@xmath77 mag ( red circles ) .",
    "the dashed line marks the @xmath2  limit of our search ( the region below the line is inaccessible to the survey ) .",

    "[ fig : mag_all],scaledwidth=48.0% ]      of the 19 fast transients discovered in our search , 8 events lack quiescent counterparts in any of the deep template images ( @xmath1@xmath2@xmath51@xmath52 ) to typical limits of @xmath78 mag .",
    "these sources are in principle a promising population of distant extragalactic transients with undetected host galaxies .",
    "we utilize a combination of color information , the 33 min time - span of the @xmath1@xmath2  observations , and the sky locations to investigate the nature of these sources .",
    "we first note that all 8 sources span a narrow color range with @xmath79 mag ( figure  [ fig : mag_all ] and table  [ tab : asteroids ] ) , which is typical of main - belt asteroids ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation naturally explains the lack of quiescent counterparts in the template images .",
    "we further test this scenario by comparing the astrometric positions of each transient in the @xmath1  and @xmath2images . in figure",
    "[ fig : astrom ] we show the distribution of positional shifts for the 8 sources compared to unresolved field sources in the same images .",
    "the median offset for field sources is about 53 mas ( with a standard deviation of about 31 mas ) , indicative of the astrometric alignment precision of the mds images . on the other hand , the 8 transients exhibit shifts of @xmath80 mas ( bounded by our initial cut of @xmath81 shift ;  [ sec : search ] ) , with a median value of about 230 mas .",
    "this is well in excess of the point source population , and a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test gives a @xmath82-value of only @xmath83 for the null hypothesis that the positional offsets of the 8 transients and the field sources are drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "this clearly indicates that the 8 transients lacking quiescent counterparts exhibit larger than average astrometric shifts , supporting their identification as asteroids .",
    "we further inspect the @xmath1  and @xmath2  light curves of the 8 transients and find that none exhibit variability larger than the photometric uncertainties ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) .    and @xmath2  centroids for the fast transients lacking quiescent counterparts ( red arrows ) in comparison to the shifts for field stars from the same images ( gray hatched histogram ) .",
    "the median positional shift for the field stars , which indicates the typical astrometric uncertainty of the mds images , is about 53 mas .",
    "the fast transients lacking quiescent counterparts exhibit generally larger shifts of up to @xmath84 mas ( the limit allowed by our search ) , with a median of 230 mas .",
    "a k - s test indicates a @xmath82-value of only @xmath83 for the null hypothesis that the two populations are drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "[ fig : astrom],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    finally , we note that all 8 sources are located in the three mds fields ( md04 , md09 , and md10 ) that are positioned within @xmath85 of the ecliptic plane ( table  [ tab : asteroids ] ) .",
    "in particular , the asteroids were discovered in these fields on dates concentrated at solar elongation values of about @xmath9 deg , at which main - belt asteroids go through a stationary point with negligible apparent motion .",
    "we therefore conclude based on their colors , astrometric motions , light curve behavior , and ecliptic coordinates that the 8 fast transients lacking quiescent counterparts are simply main - belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbit .",
    "we now turn to the 11 fast transients that exhibit quiescent counterparts in some or all of the deep mds template images . in all cases",
    "we find that the counterparts are unresolved ( with a typical seeing of about @xmath86 ) and have red colors that are indicative of m dwarf stars .",
    "photometry of the quiescent counterparts from the ps1/mds templates , and from sdss when available , is summarized in table  [ tab : mdwarfs ] . using these magnitudes we determine the spectral type of each counterpart by comparing to the sdss colors of m dwarfs @xcite ; from sources with both ps1 and sdss photometry we infer color transformations of @xmath87 and @xmath88 to account for the difference between the @xmath1and @xmath52filters compared to the @xmath55 and @xmath57 filters (  [ sec : ps1 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : mdwarfs ] indicating that 7 counterparts have spectral types of about m4m5 , while the remaining 4 counterparts have spectral types of m7m9 ( see table  [ tab : mdwarfs ] for the inferred spectral types ) .",
    "we further infer the distances to these m dwarfs using their associated absolute magnitudes @xcite and find @xmath7 kpc ( table  [ tab : mdwarfs ] ) .",
    "thus , as in previous fast transient searches , all 11 fast transients with quiescent counterparts in our survey are m dwarf flares . using the flare magnitudes and",
    "inferred spectral types , we compare the resulting flare and bolometric luminosities in figure  [ fig : flares ] .",
    "we find that the flares span a luminosity range of @xmath89 erg s@xmath12 and @xmath90 erg s@xmath12 , with no apparent dependence on spectral type .",
    "however , since the bolometric luminosity declines from about @xmath91 erg s@xmath12 at spectral type m4 to about @xmath92 erg s@xmath12 at spectral type m9 , the relative flare luminosities increase with later spectral type .",
    "we find relative flare luminosities of @xmath93 l@xmath94 at @xmath95 , and larger values of @xmath96 l@xmath94 at m8m9 .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=48.0% ]    it is instructive to compare the properties of the flares and m dwarfs uncovered in our blind fast transients search to those from targeted m dwarf variability studies . in particular , @xcite searched for flares from 50,130 pre - selected m0m6 dwarfs in the sdss stripe 82 and found 271 flares , with an apparent increase in the flare rate with later spectral type .",
    "this may explain the lack of m0m4 dwarfs in our relatively small sample .",
    "for the m4m6 dwarfs @xcite find a mean flare amplitude of @xmath97 mag , comparable to our mean value of @xmath98 mag , when taking into account that m dwarfs flares are generally brighter in @xmath99-band than in @xmath100-band due a typical temperature of @xmath34 k. the flare luminosities for the stripe 82 m4m6 dwarfs are @xmath101 erg s@xmath12 , again comparable to the @xmath1-band luminosities of the @xmath102 dwarfs in our sample .",
    "we note that there are no m7m9 dwarfs in the stripe 82 sample .    and @xmath2  detections .",
    "the solid red line marks the bolometric luminosity as a function of spectral type , while dashed lines mark fractions of the bolometric luminosity as indicated in the figure .",
    "we find that the flares from the @xmath95 sources have a range of @xmath93 l@xmath94 , while the flares from the m7m9 dwarfs are relatively larger , with @xmath96 l@xmath94 .",
    "[ fig : flares],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    @xcite also found that for m4m6 dwarfs there is a strong dependence of the flare rate on vertical distance from the galactic plane ; namely , the fraction of time in which a star flares decreases by about an order of magnitude over a vertical distance range of about @xmath103 pc .",
    "the m4m6 dwarfs in our sample are all located at larger vertical distances of @xmath104 pc , with a mean of about 390 pc , suggesting that the decline in flaring activity with vertical distance from the galactic plane may not be as steep as previously inferred .",
    "moreover , the stripe 82 data exhibit a trend of steeper decline in the flare rate as a function of vertical distance with increasing spectral type @xcite , while here we find that the m7m9 dwarfs have a similar mean vertical distance from the galactic plane to the @xmath95 dwarfs .",
    "clearly , a more systematic search for m dwarf flares in the ps1/mds is required to study these trends .",
    "in particular , it is likely that we have missed some flares due to the requirement of no additional variability within a @xmath67 night window around each detection (  [ sec : search ] ) .",
    "the 19 fast transients uncovered by our search cleanly divide into two categories : ( i ) main - belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits (  [ sec : asteroids ] ) ; and ( ii ) flares from m dwarf stars (  [ sec : mdwarfs ] ) .",
    "neither category is unexpected given that our search is based on consecutive @xmath1@xmath2  detections with a time - span of about 0.5 hr .",
    "m dwarf flares typically exhibit blue colors indicative of @xmath105 k , with timescales of minutes to hours , and are thus ubiquitous in searches that utilize rapid observations in the ultraviolet @xcite or blue optical bands @xcite .",
    "similarly , our requirement of two consecutive detections within @xmath20 hr , with non - detections on preceding or subsequent nights is effective at capturing asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits ( i.e. , at solar elongations of about @xmath9 deg for main - belt asteroids ) .",
    "since we account for all 19 fast transients as solar system or galactic in origin , we can place a robust upper limit on the rate of extragalactic fast optical transients . while we could in principle detect a sufficiently bright transient with a timescale as short as about 4 min , corresponding to a detection in only the final exposure in one filter and the first exposure in the second filter , a more reasonable timescale probed by our search is about 0.5 hr , the time - span of a full @xmath1@xmath2  exposure sequence ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) .",
    "similarly , our selection criteria could in principle accommodate transients with durations as long as @xmath106 d , but for the bulk of the search the maximum timescale is @xmath66 d. thus , we consider our search to place limits on fast transients spanning about 0.5 hr to 1 d. in the discussion below we provide upper limits for the upper and lower bounds of the timescale distribution .",
    "the total areal exposure of our survey for a timescale of 0.5 hr is @xmath107 deg@xmath108 d , while for a timescale of @xmath21 it is correspondingly longer , @xmath109 deg@xmath108 d. thus , we can place a @xmath13 confidence limit ( @xmath110 events ) on the sky - projected rate of : @xmath111 where we estimate the detection efficiency per filter at @xmath112 based on the overall search for transients in the mds fields .",
    "thus , for a timescale of 0.5 hr we place a limit of @xmath113 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 , while for a timescale of @xmath114 it is @xmath115 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 ( see table  [ tab : rates ] ) .",
    "our limit on fast transients with a 0.5 hr timescale improves on existing searches with similar limiting magnitudes by a factor of @xmath15 ( figure  [ fig : surveys1 ] ) thanks to the much larger effective areal exposure .",

    "the survey depth impacts the inferred limits on _ volumetric _ rates .",
    "for example , for a population of fast transients with a fiducial absolute magnitude of @xmath123 ( comparable to the most luminous known novae ; see  [ sec : models ] ) , the limits on the volumetric rates on a timescale of 0.5 hr are @xmath22 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 for our survey , @xmath124 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 for dls , and @xmath125 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 for fornax . the small volume probed by the rotse - iii search for transients with @xmath123 mag ( @xmath126 mpc ) provides no real insight on the extragalactic population . for a fiducial absolute magnitude of @xmath127 ( comparable to the least luminous supernovae ) , the limits are @xmath24 ( ps1/mds ) , @xmath128 ( dls ) , and @xmath129 ( fornax ) mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 ; at this peak magnitude the maximal detection distances are large enough to uniformly sample the galaxy distribution ( about @xmath54 mpc for our search ; @xmath130 mpc for dls , and @xmath131 mpc for fornax ) . finally , for a fiducial absolute magnitude of @xmath132 ( intermediate between long and short gamma - ray burst afterglows ; see  [ sec : models ] ) , the volumetric rate limits are @xmath26 ( ps1/mds ) , @xmath133 ( dls ) , and @xmath134 ( fornax ) mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 .",

    "this indicates that any source population of extragalactic fast optical transients with a timescale of 0.5 hr would have to be much more abundant than nova , supernova , or grb progenitors , or produce multiple ( @xmath137 ) events per progenitor system to be detected with current surveys .    utilizing the @xmath138-band luminosity density in the local universe (",
    "@xmath139 l@xmath140 mpc@xmath23 ) the upper limits on the volumetric rates at @xmath123 mag can be recast as @xmath141 ( ps1/mds ) and @xmath142 ( dls ) yr@xmath12 per @xmath29 l@xmath140 ; for the fornax survey , which targeted a galaxy cluster environment , the limit is @xmath143 yr@xmath12 per @xmath29 l@xmath140 @xcite . for a fiducial brightness of @xmath127 mag , the limits are @xmath144 ( ps1/mds ) , @xmath145 ( dls ) , and @xmath146 yr@xmath12 per @xmath29 l@xmath140 ; the latter value is from @xcite .",

    "we defer an exhaustive investigation of this question to future work and focus on the basic arguments here . at the most basic level , we note that explosive sources with a characteristic velocity of @xmath34 km s@xmath12 that emit thermally with a peak in the optical ( @xmath105 k ) will be limited to an absolute magnitude of @xmath152 ; only sources undergoing relativistic expansion ( e.g. , grbs ) may significantly exceed this limits .",
    "we expand on this general theme below .",
    "we first investigate the possibility of unusually fast and luminous classical novae . in general , novae follow the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline ( mmrd ) relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which indicates that faster novae are also more luminous .",
    "however , the mmrd relation flattens to a maximal observed value of about @xmath123 mag for timescales shorter than a few days @xcite . indeed , the shortest observed timescales ( quantified as @xmath153 or @xmath154 , the timescales to decline by 2 or 3 magnitudes , respectively ) are @xmath155 d @xcite .",
    "theoretical models point to maximal magnitudes of about @xmath123 and timescales as short as @xmath156 d @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fraction of novae that achieve such high peak luminosity and rapid fading is @xmath157 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to a rate of @xmath148 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 , orders of magnitude below the upper bounds for @xmath123 mag derived from the various searches ( e.g. , 0.3 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 for our search ; table  [ tab : rates ] ) .",
    "thus , novae are not expected to contribute a population of luminous and fast extragalactic transients for current surveys .",
    "we next explore the generic case of an explosive event with ejecta that cool adiabatically due to free expansion ( @xmath158 ) ; i.e. , a supernova - like explosion , but lacking internal heating . in this case , with the expansion driven by radiation pressure and using the standard diffusion approximation @xcite , the luminosity is given by : @xmath159,\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is the initial hydrodynamic timescale , @xmath161 is the initial diffusion timescale , @xmath162 is the opacity ( for simplicity we use @xmath163 cm@xmath35 g@xmath12 ) , @xmath165 is the ejecta mass , @xmath166 is a geometric factor , and @xmath167 is the initial luminosity . a fiducial timescale of 0.5 hr requires @xmath168 cm ; i.e. , more extended sources are unlikely to produce transients with a duration as short as @xmath20 hr . using the appropriate size limit we find that for a source with @xmath169 the resulting peak bolometric magnitude ranges from about -8 mag ( for a white dwarf with @xmath170 cm ) to about @xmath171 mag ( for a star with @xmath172 r@xmath173 ) .",
    "the resulting characteristic effective temperature ranges from @xmath174 k ( for @xmath170 cm ) to @xmath175 k ( for @xmath176 r@xmath173 ) , or a peak in the ultraviolet .",
    "this means that the peak absolute magnitude in @xmath177 will be a few magnitudes fainter , corresponding to the faint end of the magnitude range considered in the previous section ( i.e. , @xmath152 mag ) .",
    "the luminosity can be enhanced by appealing to an internal energy source , for example radioactive heating as in the case of type i supernovae . in this scenario",
    "the luminosity is maximized if the radioactive decay timescale is well - matched to the diffusion timescale , @xmath178 hr . the fast timescale investigated here requires different radioactive material than @xmath179ni , which powers the optical light curves of type i supernovae , since the latter has @xmath180 d. instead , a better match may be provided by the radioactive decay of @xmath181-process elements , for which there is a broad range of timescales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using a timescale of 0.5 hr we find that the required ejecta mass is low , @xmath182 m@xmath173 . for radioactive heating",
    "the total energy generation rate is @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is an efficiency factor , likely in the range of @xmath185 @xcite . for the ejecta mass inferred above",
    "we find @xmath186 erg s@xmath12 , and hence @xmath187 erg s@xmath12 ( for @xmath188 ) , or an absolute magnitude of about @xmath189 mag .",
    "as in the discussion above , the spectrum will peak in the ultraviolet , and the optical emission ( @xmath100-band ) will be dimmer by about 2 mag ( i.e. , to a peak of about @xmath123 mag ) . for a fiducial timescale of @xmath151 ,",
    "the peak absolute magnitude is larger , reaching @xmath190 mag in the optical .",
    "this is essentially the `` kilonova '' model invoked for compact object binary mergers @xcite , with a predicted volumetric rate of @xmath191 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that recent opacity calculations for @xmath181-process material indicate that the actual peak brightness in the optical bands will be an order of magnitude fainter than suggested by the above calculation @xcite .",
    "a similar scenario is the thermonuclear .ia supernova model with heating by radioactive @xmath192-chain elements ( ca , ti ) , leading to a peak optical brightness of @xmath193 mag , but with a longer timescale of @xmath194 even for low helium shell masses @xcite .",
    "thus , models with radioactive heating are limited to @xmath195 mag ( @xmath20 hr ) or @xmath196 mag ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "an alternative internal energy source is the spin - down of a newly - born millisecond magnetar @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the maximal luminosity is achieved when the magnetar spin - down timescale , @xmath198 s , is comparable to the diffusion timescale , @xmath199 hr ; here @xmath138 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath200 is the initial rotation period .",
    "the available rotational energy is large , @xmath201 erg , and therefore a magnetar engine can in principle produce extremely luminous fast transients , with a peak brightness of @xmath202 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "however , since @xmath199 hr requires a low ejecta mass of @xmath203 m@xmath173 , this scenario necessitates magnetar birth with negligible ejected mass , and results in a relativistic outflow ; this is essentially the scenario invoked in magnetar models of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "it is not obvious in this scenario whether the large energy reservoir will be emitted in the optical band , or primarily at x - ray/@xmath204-ray energies .",
    "thus , the optical signature may still be rather weak , and perhaps dominated instead by interaction with the ambient medium ( i.e. , an afterglow ) .",
    "overall , the estimated magnetar birth rate is @xmath205 of the core - collapse supernova rate @xcite , while the grb rate is @xmath157 of the supernova rate @xcite .",
    "this indicates that any magnetar - powered fast optical transients will have a rate orders of magnitude below the upper limits inferred by the existing searches .",
    "finally , luminous rapid optical transients can be produced by circumstellar interaction of a relativistic outflow , such as an on - axis grb afterglow .",
    "the typical absolute magnitude of a short - duration grb afterglow at @xmath206 hr is about @xmath207 mag ( based on a typical apparent brightness of about @xmath208 mag and a typical redshift of @xmath209 ; @xcite ) . at this fiducial luminosity",
    "the inferred volumetric upper limits from the fast optical transient searches are @xmath210 ( ps1/mds ) , @xmath211 ( dls ) , @xmath212 ( fornax ) , and @xmath213 ( rotse - iii ) mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 . the actual volumetric rate of on - axis short grbs is about @xmath214 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 @xcite , at least @xmath215 times lower than the limits reached by the surveys . for long - duration grbs the typical absolute magnitude at @xmath206 hr is much larger , about @xmath216 mag ( based on a typical apparent brightness of about @xmath217 mag and a typical redshift of @xmath218 ; @xcite ) . at this luminosity",
    "the volumetric upper limits for the various searches are @xmath26 ( ps1/mds ) , @xmath219 ( dls ) , @xmath220 ( fornax ) , and @xmath221 ( rotse - iii ) mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 .",
    "the inferred on - axis volumetric rate ( at @xmath222 ) is @xmath223 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus , unless there is a substantial population of relativistic explosions that do not produce @xmath204-ray emission , the existing limits are much too shallow in the context of on - axis grb rates .",
    "we therefore conclude based on the comparison to various potential models and populations that :    * _ non - relativistic _ fast optical transients with a timescale of @xmath20 hr ( @xmath151 ) are generically limited to a peak optical brightness of @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) mag even if they are powered by radioactive heating ; revised opacities for @xmath181-process matter may reduce these values by about an order of magnitude .",
    "similarly , unusually fast classical novae are not likely to reach peak magnitudes larger than about @xmath123 mag .",
    "overall , the limits achieved by existing searches at these luminosities ( table  [ tab : rates ] ) are orders of magnitude higher than the known and expected event rates for such transients ( e.g. , @xmath148",
    "mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 for luminous novae ) .",
    "* _ relativistic _ sources such as on - axis grbs or transients powered by the spin - down of millisecond magnetars can produce much larger luminosities on a timescale of @xmath20 hr , but the volumetric rate limits from the existing searches are still orders of magnitude larger than the very low known or anticipated rates of relativistic explosions .",
    "a possible exception is a fast transient recently discovered by @xcite , although with a timescale of @xmath224 d.    in figure  [ fig : surveys2 ] we summarize this information by comparing the volumetric rate limits from the various surveys at fiducial peak absolute magnitudes of @xmath123 , @xmath127 , @xmath207 ( short grb ) , and @xmath216 ( long grb ) to the rates of known transients ( e.g. , novae , supernovae , neutron star binary mergers , on - axis short and long grbs ) .",
    "the results demonstrate that the existing survey limits are orders of magnitude above the anticipated event rates based on the known classes .",
    "this indicates that much larger surveys are essential to robustly explore the transient sky on the @xmath225 timescale .",
    "in addition , we stress that given the low expected luminosity for non - relativistic fast transients ( @xmath152 ) , a profitable strategy is to systematically target nearby galaxies ( as was done for example in the fornax cluster search ; @xcite ) rather than image wide blank fields . on the other hand , searches for the rare but highly luminous relativistic fast transients are best focused on covering wide fields ( preferably @xmath226 ) at the expense of survey depth since the projected rate is at most @xmath227 per sky per day , while the limiting factor for distance coverage is the use of optical filters ( limited to @xmath228 ) rather than depth .",
    "our search for fast optical transients proved highly effective at identifying foreground events _ without the need for expensive follow - up observations_. this is unlike previous searches such as dls and fornax .",
    "this has been accomplished thanks to the use of dual - filter observations spanning a timescale of about 0.5 hr , with each observation composed of multiple exposures that help to eliminate individual spurious detections .",
    "in addition , the availability of color information ( @xmath229 in this case ) , coupled with the time baseline allowed us to effectively identify main - belt asteroids near the stationary point . similarly , deep multi - band templates allowed us to unambiguously identify m dwarf counterparts for all detected flares to a distance of at least @xmath230 kpc and with spectral types extending to about m9 . with this information",
    "we were able to account for all the fast optical transients found in the survey , and to place the deepest limit to date on the rate of extragalactic fast transients .",
    "our results are reassuring given that follow - up spectroscopy in the era of on - going and future large surveys is in limited supply .    with this in mind , it is instructive to consider our results in the context of the anticipated lsst survey strategy @xcite .",
    "the lsst main survey is intended to cover a total of @xmath231 deg@xmath35 , accounting for about @xmath232 of the observing time .",
    "each pointing will consist of two visits per field with a separation of about @xmath233 min , with each visit consisting of a pair of 15 s exposures with a @xmath234 depth of @xmath235 mag ( or about 23.5 mag at @xmath236 ) .",
    "it is anticipated that a total of about @xmath237 deg@xmath35 will be imaged on any given night , potentially with more than one filter , leading to an areal exposure of about @xmath238 deg@xmath35 d in a single night , or about @xmath239 deg@xmath35 d per year , for the fiducial timescale of 0.5 hr .",
    "this survey will therefore achieve a sky projected rate limit ( @xmath13 confidence level ) of @xmath240 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 in a single night and @xmath241 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 in a year .",
    "the latter value represents a factor of 400 times improvement relative to our ps1/mds search . in terms of a volumetric rate , the greater depth achieved by lsst will probe rates of @xmath242 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 for @xmath123 mag and @xmath243 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 for @xmath127 mag for 1 year of operations . at a typical brightness of short and long grbs , the rate will be about @xmath244 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 ( limited to @xmath245 by the @xmath246 filters ) , a few times deeper than the actual on - axis grb rate , indicating that lsst is likely to detect such events .",
    "the lsst data set can form the basis for a search similar to the one described here , with the main difference that contemporaneous color information may not be available . however , with a @xmath247 cut as imposed here , the observations will reach about 1 mag deeper than our search , indicating that they will uncover m dwarf flares to distances that are only about @xmath248 larger than those found here ( i.e. , generally @xmath249 kpc ) . at the same time",
    ", the lsst templates will reach a comparable depth to the ps1/mds templates after only @xmath250 visits per field per filter , i.e. , within a year of when the survey commences .",
    "thus , we conclude that it will be simple to identify m dwarf counterparts in the template images for essentially all m dwarf flares , negating the need for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "this approach will effectively eliminate the largest known contaminating foreground for @xmath251 timescales .",
    "similarly , the time baseline of @xmath233 min per field will allow for astrometric rejection of most asteroids even near the stationary point , although as we found in our ps1/mds search some asteroids have negligible motions that are indistinguishable from the astrometric scatter of field sources ( @xmath252 in our search ) .",
    "such asteroids can in principle be recognized using color information , but this is not likely to be available with lsst . on the other hand , a constant brightness level between visits @xmath233 min apart , combined with a location near the ecliptic plane and in particular with solar elongation of @xmath253 deg , will be indicative of an asteroid origin .",
    "such fields can simply be avoided in searches for fast transients .",
    "thus , the two primary contaminants for extragalactic fast optical transient searches ( m dwarf flares and asteroids near the stationary point ) will be identifiable with the lsst baseline survey strategy .",
    "furthermore , we anticipate based on the comparison to known transient classes that with a year of operations lsst is unlikely to reveal large numbers of extragalactic fast transients unless they result from a source population that far exceeds classical novae , supernova progenitors , or compact object binaries ( figure  [ fig : surveys2 ] ) .",
    "we present a search for fast optical transients on a timescale of about 0.5 hr to 1 d in consecutive @xmath1@xmath2  observations of the ps1/mds fields , by requiring a detection in both filters with no additional detections on preceding or subsequent nights .",
    "the search yielded 19 astrophysical transients , of which 8 events that lack quiescent counterparts are identified as main - belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits , while the remaining 11 transients are identified as flares from m5m9 dwarf stars at distances of about @xmath254 kpc .",
    "the flare properties are generally similar to those from m dwarfs studied in the sdss stripe 82 , although our sample extends to later spectral types and to much greater vertical distances from the galactic plane .",
    "a key result of our search is a limit on the sky - projected rate of extragalactic fast transients of @xmath255 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 ( @xmath20 hr ) that is about @xmath15 time deeper than previous limits ; the limit for a timescale of @xmath16 is @xmath256 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 .",
    "the upper bounds on the volumetric rates at fiducial absolute magnitudes of @xmath123 , @xmath127 , and @xmath132 mag are likewise an order of magnitude deeper than from previous searches ( table  [ tab : rates ] ) . with an additional @xmath257 years of ps1/mds data in hand we can improve these estimates by a factor of a few .",
    "we also anticipate additional m dwarf flare detections that will allow us to better characterize the distribution of flare properties , as well as the properties of flaring m dwarfs in general .",
    "to guide the conversion from our sky - projected rate to volumetric rates , and to motivate future searches for fast transients , we also explore the expected luminosities of such transients for a range of physically motivated models .",
    "we find that non - relativistic fast transients are generally limited to about @xmath123 mag for a timescale of @xmath20 hr and @xmath127 mag for a timescale of @xmath16 even if powered by radioactive decay .",
    "this is simply a reflection of the low ejecta mass required to achieve a rapid diffusion timescale of @xmath258 .",
    "such low luminosity events are best explored through targeted searches of galaxies in the local universe , with anticipated event rates of @xmath259 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 ( figure  [ fig : surveys2 ] ) . a separate class of relativistic fast transients ( on - axis grbs , magnetar engines )",
    "can exceed @xmath260 mag on a timescale of @xmath20 hr , but they are exceedingly rare , with anticipated volumetric rates of @xmath223 mpc@xmath23 yr@xmath12 ( or sky - projected rates of a few per sky per day ) .",
    "such event rates are orders of magnitude below the level probed in current searches , but will be reached by the lsst main survey in a full year .",
    "another strategy to find such events is a shallower search of a wider sky area than is planned for lsst .",
    "we note that a broad exploration of the various mechanisms that can power optical transients is essential to guide and motivate future searches for fast extragalactic transients .",
    "the initial investigation performed here already places clear bounds on the luminosities and rates for a wide range of mechanisms .",
    "finally , since the ps1/mds survey is currently the only close analogue to the main lsst survey in terms of depth , cadence , and choice of filters , we use the results of our search to investigate the efficacy of fast transient searches with lsst .",
    "we demonstrate that the main contaminants recognized here should be identifiable with the lsst survey strategy , without the need for expensive follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "namely , asteroids near the stationary point can be recognized through a larger than average astrometric shift , a constant brightness in visits separated by @xmath233 min , and an expected location near the ecliptic plane with solar elongation of @xmath9 deg .",
    "lsst may not provide near - simultaneous color information , which can serve as an additional discriminant for asteroids . for m dwarf",
    "flares we show that lsst s increased sensitivity will probe a larger volume of the galaxy , but the correspondingly deeper templates will still allow for the identification of quiescent counterparts in essentially all cases .",
    "the ps1/mds survey demonstrates that with multi - band photometry it is possible to identify m dwarf flares without the need for follow - up spectroscopy ( as in previous searches ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this result indicates that extragalactic fast optical transients should be able to pierce the veil of foreground flares .",

    "<S> we place an upper limit of @xmath10 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 ( @xmath13 confidence level ) on the sky - projected rate of extragalactic fast transients at @xmath14 mag , a factor of @xmath15 times lower than previous limits ; the limit for a timescale of @xmath16 is @xmath17 deg@xmath11 d@xmath12 . to convert these sky - projected rates to volumetric rates , we explore the expected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by various mechanisms , and find that non - relativistic events are limited to @xmath18 mag ( @xmath19 mag ) for a timescale of @xmath20 hr ( @xmath21 ) , while relativistic sources ( e.g. , gamma - ray bursts , magnetar - powered transients ) can reach much larger luminosities . </S>",
