    "the local rigidity theorem of weil @xcite and garland @xcite for complete , finite volume hyperbolic manifolds states that there is no non - trivial deformation of such a structure through _ complete _ hyperbolic structures if the manifold has dimension at least 3 .",
    "if the manifold is closed , the condition that the structures be complete is automatically satisfied .",
    "however , if the manifold is non - compact , there may be deformations through incomplete structures .",
    "this can not happen in dimensions greater than 3 ( garland - raghunathan @xcite ) ; but there are always non - trivial deformations in dimension 3 ( thurston @xcite ) in the non - compact case .    in @xcite this rigidity theory is extended to a class of finite volume , orientable 3-dimensional hyperbolic cone - manifolds , _",
    "i.e. _ hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds with cone - like singularities along a knot or link .",
    "the main result is that such structures are locally rigid if the cone angles are fixed , under the extra hypothesis that all cone angles are at most @xmath0 .",
    "there is a smooth , incomplete structure on the complement of the singular locus ; by completing the metric the singular cone - metric is recovered .",
    "the space of deformations of ( generally incomplete ) hyperbolic structures on this open manifold has non - zero dimension , so there will be deformations if the cone angles are allowed to vary .",
    "an application of the implicit function theorem shows that it is possible to deform the structure so that the metric completion is still a 3-dimensional hyperbolic cone - manifold , and it is always possible to deform the cone - manifold to make arbitrary ( small ) changes in the cone angles .",
    "in fact , the collection of cone angles locally parametrizes the set of cone - manifold structures .",
    "a ( smooth ) finite volume hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold with cusps is the interior of a compact @xmath1-manifold with torus boundary components .",
    "filling these in by attaching solid tori produces a closed manifold ; there is an infinite number of topologically distinct ways to do this , parametrized by the isotopy classes of the curves on the boundary tori that bound disks in the solid tori .",
    "these curves are called the  surgery curves \" .",
    "the manifold with cusps can be viewed as a cone - manifold structure with cone angles @xmath2 on any of these closed manifolds .",
    "if it is possible to increase the cone angle from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , this constructs a smooth hyperbolic structure on this closed manifold .",
    "this process is called _ hyperbolic dehn surgery_. thurston ( @xcite ) proved that hyperbolic dehn surgery fails for at most a finite number of choices of surgery curves on each boundary component .",
    "the proof of local rigidity puts strong constraints on those deformations of hyperbolic cone - manifolds that _ do _ exist .",
    "it is possible to control the change in the geometric structure when the cone angles are deformed a fixed amount .",
    "importantly , this control depends only on the geometry in a tubular neighborhood around the singular locus , not on the rest of the @xmath1-manifold .",
    "in particular , it provides geometric and analytic control on the hyperbolic dehn surgery process .",
    "this idea is developed in @xcite .    that paper provides a quantitative version of thurston s hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem .",
    "applications include the first universal bounds on the number of non - hyperbolic dehn fillings on a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold , and estimates on the changes in volume and core geodesic length during hyperbolic dehn filling .",
    "the local rigidity theory of @xcite was generalized by bromberg ( @xcite ) to include geometrically finite hyperbolic cone - manifolds .",
    "recently , there have been some very imaginative and interesting applications of the deformation theory of geometrically finite hyperbolic cone - manifolds to well - known problems in kleinian groups . in particular ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite in this volume for a description of some of these results and references to others .",
    "our purpose here is to provide a brief outline of the main ideas and results from @xcite and @xcite and how they are related to the kleinian group applications .",
    "as noted above , the central idea is that rigidity results can be turned into effective control on the deformations that do exist .",
    "however , we wish to emphasize a particular consequence that provides the common theme between @xcite and the kleinian group applications in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as a corollary of the control provided by effective rigidity ,",
    "it is possible to give precise analytic and geometric meaning to the familiar idea that hyperbolic structures with short geodesics are  close \" to ones with cusps .",
    "specifically , it can be shown that a structure with a sufficiently short geodesic can be deformed through hyperbolic cone - manifolds to a complete structure , viewed as having cone angle @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the total change in the structure can be proved to be arbitrarily small for structures with arbitrarily short geodesics .",
    "most importantly this control is independent of the manifolds involved , depending only on the lengths and cone angles .",
    "there are varied reasons for wanting to find such a family of cone - manifolds .",
    "it is conjectured that any closed hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold can be obtained by hyperbolic dehn surgery on some singly cusped , finite volume hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold .",
    "if this were true , it could have useful implications in @xmath1-dimensional topology .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that it is true for any such closed @xmath1-manifold whose shortest geodesic has length at most @xmath4 .",
    "( see theorem [ connect ] in section [ dehn ] . )    in @xcite bromberg describes a construction that , remarkably , allows one to replace an incompressible , geometrically infinite end with a short geodesic by a geometrically finite one by gluing in a wedge that creates a cone angle of @xmath5 along the short geodesic .",
    "pushing the cone angle back to @xmath3 provides an approximation of the structure with a geometrically infinite end by one with a geometrically finite end . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "bromberg and then brock and bromberg give proofs of important cases of the density conjecture in this way .",
    "this work is described in @xcite .    in general ,",
    "a sequence of kleinian groups with geodesics that are becoming arbitrarily short ( or a single kleinian group with a sequence of arbitrarily short geodesics ) is very difficult to analyze .",
    "things are often simpler when the lengths are actually _ equal _ to @xmath2 ; i.e. , when they are cusps .",
    "thus , if structures with short geodesics can be uniformly compared with structures where they have become cusps , this can be quite useful .",
    "one example where this idea has been successfully employed is @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that there will be others in the near future .",
    "note that the application to the density conjecture above involves cone angles between @xmath5 and @xmath3 whereas the theory in @xcite and @xcite requires cone angles to be at most @xmath3 .",
    "thus , this application actually depends on a new version of the deformation theory ( @xcite ) which applies to all cone angles , as long as there is a tube of a certain radius around the singular locus .    because of its connection with these kleinian group results , we use the current paper as an opportunity to outline the main points in this new theory .",
    "it is based on a boundary value problem which is used to construct infinitesimal deformations with the same essential properties as those utilized in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "explaining those properties and how they are used occupies sections [ harmdef ] to [ dehn ] .",
    "the discussion of kleinian groups and the new deformation theory are both contained in section [ boundaryvalues ] , the final section of the paper .    the relaxation of the cone angle restriction has implications for hyperbolic dehn surgery .",
    "some of these are also described in the final section .",
    "( see theorems [ bdrylocalparam ] and [ shapethm ] . )",
    "a standard method for analyzing families of structures or maps is to look at the infinitesimal theory where the determining equations simplify considerably . to this end",
    ", we first describe precisely what we mean by a @xmath6-parameter family of hyperbolic structures on a manifold .",
    "associated to the derivative of such a family are various analytic , algebraic , and geometric objects which play a central role in this theory .",
    "it is useful to be able to move freely among the interpretations provided by these objects and we attempt to explain the relationships between them .",
    "the initial portion of this analysis is quite general , applying to hyperbolic structures in any dimension or , even more broadly , to structures modeled on a lie group acting transitively and analytically on a manifold .    a hyperbolic structure on an @xmath7-manifold @xmath8",
    "is determined by local charts modeled on @xmath9 whose overlap maps are restrictions of global isometries of @xmath9 .",
    "these determine , via analytic continuation , a map @xmath10 from the universal cover @xmath11 of @xmath8 to @xmath9 , called the _ developing map _ , which is determined uniquely up to post - multiplication by an element of @xmath12 .",
    "the developing map satisfies the equivariance property @xmath13 , for all @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 acts on @xmath11 by covering transformations , and @xmath17 is the _ holonomy representation _ of the structure .",
    "the developing map also determines the hyperbolic metric on @xmath11 by pulling back the hyperbolic metric on @xmath9 .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite for a complete discussion of these ideas . )",
    "we say that two hyperbolic structures are _ equivalent _ if there is a diffeomorphism @xmath18 from @xmath8 to itself taking one structure to the other .",
    "we will use the term  hyperbolic structure \" to mean such an equivalence class .",
    "1-parameter family _",
    ", @xmath19 , of hyperbolic structures defines a 1-parameter family of developing maps @xmath20 , where two families are equivalent under the relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 are isometries of @xmath9 and @xmath23 are lifts of diffeomorphisms @xmath24 from @xmath8 to itself .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the identity , and denote @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "all of the maps here are assumed to be smooth and to vary smoothly with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "the tangent vector to a smooth family of hyperbolic structures will be called an _ infinitesimal deformation_. the derivative at @xmath30 of a 1-parameter family of developing maps @xmath20 defines a map @xmath31 . for any point @xmath32",
    ", @xmath33 is a curve in @xmath9 describing how the image of @xmath34 is moving under the developing maps ; @xmath35 is the initial tangent vector to the curve .",
    "we will identify @xmath11 locally with @xmath9 and @xmath36 locally with @xmath37 via the initial developing map @xmath28 .",
    "note that this identification is generally not a global diffeomorphism unless the hyperbolic structure is complete .",
    "however , it is a _ local _ diffeomorphism , providing identification of small open sets in @xmath11 with ones in @xmath9",
    ".    in particular , each point @xmath32 has a neighborhood @xmath38 where @xmath39 is defined , and the derivative at @xmath40 defines a vector field on @xmath11 , @xmath41 .",
    "this vector field determines the infinitesimal variation in developing maps since @xmath42 , and also determines the infinitesimal variation in metric as follows .",
    "let @xmath43 be the hyperbolic metric on @xmath11 obtained by pulling back the hyperbolic metric on @xmath9 via @xmath44 and put @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath46 and the infinitesimal variation in metrics @xmath47 is the lie derivative , @xmath48 , of the initial metric @xmath49 along @xmath50 .",
    "riemannian covariant differentiation of the vector field @xmath50 gives a @xmath36 valued 1-form on @xmath11 , @xmath51 , defined by @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "we can decompose @xmath54 at each point into a symmetric part and skew - symmetric part .",

    "the _ skew - symmetric _",

    ", we consider the lie algebra @xmath62 of @xmath12 as vector fields on @xmath9 representing infinitesimal isometries of @xmath9 . pulling back these vector fields via the initial developing map",
    "@xmath28 gives locally defined infinitesimal isometries on @xmath11 and on @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath63 denote the vector bundles over @xmath64 respectively of ( germs of ) infinitesimal isometries .",
    "then we can regard @xmath65 as the product bundle with total space @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is isomorphic to @xmath68 where @xmath69 with @xmath15 acting on @xmath11 by covering transformations and on @xmath70 by the adjoint action of the holonomy @xmath71 . at each point @xmath72 of @xmath11 ,",
    "the fiber of @xmath65 splits as a direct sum of infinitesimal pure translations and infinitesimal pure rotations about @xmath72 ; these can be identified with @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "the hyperbolic metric on @xmath75 induces a metric on @xmath73 and on @xmath74 .",
    "a metric can then be defined on the fibers of @xmath65 in which the two factors are orthogonal ; this descends to a metric on the fibers of @xmath67 .    given a vector field @xmath76 ,",
    "we can lift it to a section @xmath77 by choosing an `` osculating '' infinitesimal isometry @xmath78 which best approximates the vector field @xmath50 at each point @xmath32 .",

    "@xmath84 satisfies the cocyle condition @xmath85 , so it represents a class in group cohomology @xmath86 \\in h^1(\\pi_1(\\m);ad \\rho)$ ] , describing the variation of holonomy representations @xmath87 .",
    "regarding @xmath80 as a vector - valued function with values in the vector space @xmath62 , its differential @xmath88 satisfies @xmath89 so it descends to a closed 1-form @xmath90 on @xmath8 with values in the bundle @xmath67 .",
    "hence it determines a de rham cohomology class @xmath91\\in h^1(\\m ; e)$ ] .",
    "this agrees with the group cohomology class @xmath86 $ ] under the de rham isomorphism @xmath92 .",
    "also , we note that the translational part of @xmath90 can be regarded as a @xmath59-valued @xmath6-form on @xmath8 .",
    "its symmetric part is exactly the form @xmath60 defined above ( see prop 2.3(b ) of @xcite ) , describing the infinitesimal change in metric on @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , a family of hyperbolic structures determines only an equivalence class of families of developing maps and we need to see how replacing one family by an equivalent family changes both the group cocycle and the de rham cocycle .",
    "recall that a family equivalent to @xmath44 is of the form @xmath93 where @xmath22 are isometries of @xmath9 and @xmath23 are lifts of diffeomorphisms @xmath24 from @xmath8 to itself .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the identity .",
    "the @xmath22 term changes the path @xmath87 of holonomy representations by conjugating by @xmath22 .",
    "infinitesimally , this changes the cocycle @xmath94 by a coboundary in the sense of group cohomology .",
    "thus it leaves the class in @xmath95 unchanged . the diffeomorphisms @xmath24 amount to choosing a different map from @xmath96 to @xmath19 .",
    "but @xmath24 is isotopic to @xmath97 , so the lifts @xmath23 do nt change the group cocycle at all .",
    "it follows that equivalent families of hyperbolic structures determine the same group cohomology class .",
    "if , instead , we view the infinitesimal deformation as represented by the @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form @xmath90 , we note that the infinitesimal effect of the isometries @xmath22 is to add a constant to @xmath98 .",
    "thus , @xmath99 , its projection @xmath90 , and the infinitesimal variation of metric are all unchanged",
    ". however , the infinitesimal effect of the @xmath23 is to change the vector field on @xmath11 by the lift of a globally defined vector field on @xmath8 .",
    "this changes @xmath90 by the derivative of a _ globally defined _ section of @xmath67 .",
    "hence , it does nt affect the de rham cohomology class in @xmath100 .",
    "the corresponding infinitesimal change of metric is altered by the lie derivative of a globally defined vector field on @xmath8 .",
    "in the previous section , we saw how a family of hyperbolic structures leads , at the infinitesimal level , to both a group cohomology class and a de rham cohomology class .",
    "each of these objects has certain advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the group cohomology class is determined by its values on a finite number of group generators and the equivalence relation , dividing out by coboundaries which represent infinitesimal conjugation by a lie group element , is easy to understand .",
    "local changes in the geometry of the hyperbolic manifolds are not encoded , but important global information like the infinitesimal change in the lengths of geodesics is easily derivable from the group cohomology class .",
    "however , the chosen generators of the fundamental group may not be related in any simple manner to the hyperbolic structure , making it unclear how the infinitesimal change in the holonomy representation affects the geometry of the hyperbolic structure .",
    "furthermore , it is usually hard to compute even the dimension of @xmath95 by purely algebraic means and much more difficult to find explicit classes in this cohomology group .    the de rham cohomology cocycle does contain information about the local changes in metric .",
    "the value of the corresponding group cocycle applied to an element @xmath15 can be computed simply by integrating an @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form representing the de rham class around any loop in the homotopy class of @xmath101 that element ; this is the definition of the de rham isomorphism map .",
    "however , it is generally quite difficult to find such a @xmath6-form that is sufficiently explicit to carry out this computation .",
    "furthermore , the fact that any de rham representative can be altered , within the same cohomology class , by adding an exact @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form , ( which can be induced by any smooth vector field on @xmath8 ) , means that the behavior on small open sets is virtually arbitrary , making it hard to extrapolate to information on the global change in the hyperbolic metric .    in differential",
    "topology , one method for dealing with the large indeterminacy within a _ real - valued _ cohomology class is to use hodge theory .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of a closed and co - closed ( harmonic ) @xmath6-form within a cohomology class for a closed riemannian manifold is now a standard fact .",
    "similar results are known for complete manifolds and for manifolds with boundary , where uniqueness requires certain asymptotic or boundary conditions on the forms . by putting a natural metric on the fibers of the bundle @xmath67",
    ", the same theory extends to the de rham cohomology groups , @xmath100 , that arise in the deformation theory of hyperbolic structures .",
    "the fact that these forms are harmonic implies that they satisfy certain nice elliptic linear partial differential equations .",
    "in particular , for a harmonic representative @xmath102 , the infinitesimal change in metric @xmath60 , which appears as the symmetric portion of the translational part of @xmath90 , satisfies equations of this type . as we will see in the next section , these are the key to the infinitesimal rigidity of hyperbolic structures .    for manifolds with hyperbolic metrics ,",
    "the theory of harmonic maps provides a non - linear generalization of this hodge theory , at least for closed manifolds . for non - compact manifolds or manifolds with boundary ,",
    "the asymptotic or boundary conditions needed for this theory are more complicated than those needed for the hodge theory . however , at least the relationship described below between the defining equations of the two theories continues to be valid in this general context .",
    "it is known that , given a map @xmath103 between closed hyperbolic manifolds , there is a unique harmonic map homotopic to @xmath18 .",
    "( in fact , this holds for _ negatively curved _ manifolds .",
    "see @xcite . )",
    "specifically , if @xmath104 and @xmath18 is homotopic to the identity , the identity map is this unique harmonic map .",
    "associated to a @xmath6-parameter family @xmath19 of hyperbolic structures on @xmath8 is a @xmath6-parameter family of developing maps from the universal cover @xmath11 of @xmath8 to @xmath9 . using these maps to pull back",
    "the metric on @xmath9 defines a @xmath6-parameter family of metrics on @xmath11 , and dividing out by the group of covering transformations determines a family of hyperbolic metrics @xmath43 on @xmath8 .",
    "however , a hyperbolic structure only determines an _ equivalence class _ of developing maps . because of this equivalence relation , the metrics , @xmath43 are only determined , for each fixed @xmath29 , up to pull - back by a diffeomorphism of @xmath8 . for the smooth family of hyperbolic metrics @xmath43 on @xmath8",
    ", we consider the identity map as a map from @xmath8 , equipped with the metric @xmath105 , to @xmath8 , equipped with the metric @xmath43 . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the identity map is harmonic , but in general it wo nt be harmonic .",
    "choosing the unique harmonic map homotopic to the identity for each @xmath29 and using it to pull back the metric @xmath43 defines a new family of metrics beginning with @xmath105 .",
    "( for small values of @xmath29 the harmonic map will still be a diffeomorphism . ) by uniqueness and the behavior of harmonic maps under composition with an isometry , the new family of metrics depends only on the family of hyperbolic structures . in this way",

    "harmonic \" family of metrics associated to a family of hyperbolic structures at @xmath40 , we obtain a symmetric @xmath106-tensor which describes the infinitesimal change of metric at each point of @xmath8 . using the underlying hyperbolic metric , a symmetric @xmath106-tensor on @xmath8",
    "can be viewed as a symmetric @xmath59-valued @xmath6-form .",
    "this is precisely the form @xmath60 described above which is the symmetric portion of the translational part of the hodge representative @xmath102 , corresponding to this infinitesimal deformation of the hyperbolic structure .",
    "thus , the hodge representative in the de rham cohomology group corresponds to an infinitesimal harmonic map .",
    "the corresponding infinitesimal change of metric has the property that it is @xmath107-orthogonal to the trivial variations of the initial metric given by the lie derivative of compactly supported vector fields on @xmath8 .",
    "we now specialize to the case of interest in this paper , 3-dimensional hyperbolic cone - manifolds .",
    "we recall some of the results and computations derived in @xcite .",

    "further , @xmath60 and @xmath119 determine symmetric and traceless linear maps @xmath120 at each point @xmath121 .    inside an embedded tube @xmath122 of radius @xmath123 around the singular locus @xmath111",

    "we think of @xmath129 as an ideal model for the infinitesimal deformation in a tube around the singular locus ; it is completely determined by the rate of change of cone angle .",
    "its effect on the complex length @xmath130 of any peripheral element satisfies @xmath131 in particular , the ( real ) length @xmath132 of the core geodesic satisfies @xmath133 for this model deformation .",

    "one special feature of the 3-dimensional case is the _ complex structure _ on the lie algebra @xmath134 of infinitesimal isometries of @xmath135 .",
    "the infinitesimal rotations fixing a point @xmath136 can be identified with @xmath137 , and the infinitesimal pure translations at @xmath72 correspond to @xmath138 .",
    "geometrically , if @xmath139 represents an infinitesimal translation , then @xmath140 represents an infinitesimal rotation with axis in the direction of @xmath29 .",

    "the fact that the hyperbolic structure on @xmath113 is incomplete makes the existence and uniqueness of a hodge representative substantially more subtle than the standard theory for complete hyperbolic structures ( including structures on closed manifolds ) .",
    "certain conditions on the behavior of the forms as they approach the singular locus are required .",
    "this makes the theory sensitive to the value of the cone angle at the singularity ; in particular , this is where the condition that the cone angle be at most @xmath0 arises . the fact that @xmath146 is in @xmath107 is a reflection of these asymptotic conditions . in the final section of this paper , we discuss a new version of this hodge theory , involving boundary conditions on the boundary of a tube around the singular locus , that removes the cone angle condition , replacing it with a lower bound on the radius of the tube .",
    "in this section we explain how the equations satisfied by the harmonic representative of an infinitesimal deformation lead to local rigidity results .",
    "we then come to one of our primary themes , that the arguments leading to local rigidity can be made computationally effective . by this",
    "we mean that even when there _ does _ exist a non - trivial deformation of a hyperbolic structure , the same equations can be used to bound both the geometric and analytic effect of such a deformation .",
    "this philosophy carries over into many different contexts , but here we will continue to focus on finite volume @xmath1-dimensional hyperbolic cone - manifolds .    the first step is to represent an infinitesimal deformation by a hodge ( harmonic ) representative @xmath90 in the cohomology group @xmath147 , as discussed in the previous section . if @xmath8 is any hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold , the symmetric real part of this representative is a 1-form @xmath60 with values in the tangent bundle of @xmath8 , satisfying the weitzenbck - type formula : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the exterior covariant derivative on such forms and @xmath150 is its adjoint . first , suppose @xmath8 is closed .",
    "taking the @xmath107 inner product of this formula with @xmath60 and integrating by parts gives the formula @xmath151 ( here @xmath152 denotes the square of the @xmath107 norm of @xmath60 on @xmath153 . ) thus @xmath154 and the deformation is trivial .",
    "this is the proof of local rigidity for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds , using the methods of calabi @xcite , weil @xcite and matsushima - murakami @xcite .",

    "implies that , in the decomposition @xmath179 , the @xmath125 term must be non - trivial for a non - trivial deformation .",

    "the positivity result ( [ eta0pos ] ) can also be used to find _ upper bounds _ on @xmath192 . on the face of it , this may seem somewhat surprising , but , as we explain below , the algebraic structure of the quadratic form @xmath192 makes it quite straightforward to derive such bounds .    the possible harmonic forms @xmath193 give a 3-dimensional real vector space @xmath194 representing models for deformations of hyperbolic cone - manifold structures in a neighborhood of the boundary torus .",

    "once @xmath125 is fixed , the inequality @xmath203 restricts @xmath204 to lie in an ellipse ( as illustrated above ) .",
    "since @xmath199 has a positive maximum on this compact set , this gives an explicit upper bound for @xmath205 for any deformation .",

    "a crucial property of the inequalities ( [ b00 ] ) and ( [ l2estimate ] ) is their dependence only on the geometry of the boundary torus , not on the rest of the hyperbolic manifold .",

    "such a bound can be used to bound the infinitesimal change in geometric quantities , like lengths of geodesics , away from the singular locus .",
    "arbitrarily short core geodesics typically lead to the conclusion that these infinitesimal changes are arbitrarily small , a useful fact when studying approximation by manifolds with short geodesics .",
    "this will be discussed further in the final section .",
    "the principle that the contribution of @xmath126 to @xmath192 is essentially negative ( ignoring the cross - terms ) while @xmath192 is positive also provides a bound on the size of @xmath126 .",

    "the only other term affecting the length of the singular locus is @xmath126 .",
    "explicit computation ultimately leads to the following estimate :    [ keyboundtheorem ] consider any smooth family of hyperbolic cone structures on @xmath109 , all of whose cone angles are at most @xmath3 . for any component of the singular set , let @xmath132 denote its length and @xmath206 its cone angle .",

    "we begin with a non - compact , finite volume hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold @xmath8 , which , for simplicity , we assume has a single cusp . in the general case",
    "the cusps are handled independently .",
    "the manifold @xmath8 is the interior of a compact manifold which has a single torus boundary , which is necessarily incompressible . by attaching a solid torus by a diffeomorphism along this boundary torus ,",
    "one obtains a closed manifold , determined up to diffeomorphism by the isotopy class of the non - trivial simple closed curve @xmath101 on the torus which bounds a disk in the solid torus .",
    "the resulting manifold is denoted by @xmath215 and @xmath101 is referred to either as the _ meridian _ or the _ surgery curve_. the process is called _ dehn filling _ ( or dehn surgery ) .    the set of dehn fillings of @xmath8 is thus parametrized by the set of simple closed curves on the boundary torus ; after choosing a basis for @xmath216 , these are parametrized by pairs @xmath217 of relatively prime integers .",
    "thurston ( @xcite ) proved that , for all but a finite number of choices of @xmath101 , @xmath215 has a complete , smooth hyperbolic structure .",
    "however , the proof is computationally ineffective .",
    "it gives no indication of how many non - hyperbolic fillings there are or which curves @xmath101 they might correspond to . in particular , it left open the possibility that there is no upper bound to the number of non - hyperbolic fillings as one varies over all possible @xmath8 .",
    "one approach to putting a hyperbolic metric on @xmath215 is through families of hyperbolic cone - manifolds .",
    "the complete metric on the open manifold @xmath8 is deformed through incomplete metrics whose metric completions are hyperbolic cone - manifold structures on @xmath215 , with the singular set equal to the core of the added solid torus .",
    "the complete structure can be considered as a cone - manifold with angle @xmath2 .",
    "the cone angle is increased monotonically , and , if the angle of @xmath3 is reached , it defines a smooth hyperbolic metric on @xmath215 .",
    "thurston s proof of his finiteness theorem actually shows that , for _ any _ non - trivial simple closed curve @xmath101 on the boundary torus , it is possible to find such a cone - manifold structure on @xmath215 for sufficiently small ( possibly depending on @xmath8 ) values of the cone angle .",
    "this also follows from theorem [ localparam ] , which further implies that , for any angle at most @xmath3 , it is always possible to change the cone angle a small amount , either to increase it or to decrease it .",
    "locally , this can be done in a unique way since the cone angles locally parametrize the set of cone - manifold structures on @xmath215 .",
    "although there are always small variations of the cone - manifold structure , the structures may degenerate in various ways as a family of angles reaches a limit . in order to find a smooth hyperbolic metric on @xmath215",
    "it is necessary and sufficient to show that no degeneration occurs before the angle @xmath3 is attained .    in @xcite the concept of convergence of metric spaces in the gromov - hausdorff topology ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) is utilized to rule out degeneration of the metric as long as there is a lower bound on the tube radius and an upper bound on the volume .",
    "the main issue is to show that the injectivity radius in the complement of the tube around the singular locus stays bounded below .",
    "one shows that , if the injectivity radius goes to zero , a new cusp develops .",
    "analysis of dehn filling on this new cusp leads to a contradiction of thurston s finiteness theorem .",
    "the argument is similar to a central step in the proof of the orbifold theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "one result proved in @xcite is :    [ thm2 ] let @xmath218 , @xmath219 , be a smooth path of closed hyperbolic cone - manifold structures on @xmath220 with cone angle @xmath110 along the singular locus @xmath111 .",

    ", we can focus on controlling the tube radius .",
    "a general principle for smooth hyperbolic manifolds is that short geodesics have large embedded tubes around them .",
    "this follows from the margulis lemma or , alternatively in dimension @xmath1 , from jrgensen s inequality . however , both of these results require that the holonomy representation be discrete which is almost never true for cone - manifolds .",
    "in fact , the statement that there is a universal lower bound to the tube radius around a short geodesic is easily seen to be false for cone - manifolds . to see this ,",
    "consider a sequence of hyperbolic cone - manifolds whose diameters go to zero .",
    "then , both the length of the singular locus and the tube radius go to zero .",
    "for example , @xmath227 with singular locus the figure-@xmath228 knot and cone angles approaching @xmath229 from below behaves in this manner .",
    "however , a more subtle statement is true .",
    "if , at the beginning of a family of hyperbolic cone - manifold structures , the tube radius is sufficiently large and the length of the core curve is sufficiently small , then as long as the core curve remains sufficiently small , the tube radius will be bounded from below .",
    "the precise statement is given below .",
    "it should be noted that it is actually the _ product _ of the cone angle and the core length that must be bounded from above .",

    "the proof of this theorem involves estimates on  tube packing \" in cone - manifolds .",

    "one of the lifts is chosen and then packing arguments are developed to show that other lifts project onto the chosen one in a manner that fills up at least a certain amount of area in the tube in the original cone - manifold . in this way , we derive a lower bound for the area of the boundary torus which depends only on the product @xmath237 , assuming @xmath233 .",
    "this , in turn , further bounds the tube radius _ strictly _ away from @xmath238 as long as @xmath237 is sufficiently small . thus",
    ", if this product stays small the tube radius stays away from the value @xmath238 so that the estimates continue to hold .",
    "the estimates derived actually prove that , as long as these bounds hold , then @xmath239 as @xmath240 .",
    "furthermore , the rate at which the tube radius goes to infinity is bounded below .",
    "this result shows that the tube radius can be bounded below by controlling the behavior of the holonomy of the peripheral elements .",
    "the cone angle is determined by the parametrization so it suffices to understand the longitudinal holonomy . in the previous section",

    "we arrive at differential inequalities that provide strong control on the change in the geometry of the maximal tube around the singular geodesic , including the tube radius .    a horospherical torus which is a cross - section of the cusp for the complete structure on @xmath8 has an intrinsic flat structure ( i.e. , zero curvature metric ) .",
    "any two such cross - sections differ only by scaling . given a choice @xmath101 of surgery curve ,",

    "clearly this is independent of the choice of cross - section .",
    "its significance comes from the fact that its square ( usually called the _ extremal length _ of @xmath101 ) is the limiting value of the ratio @xmath241 of the cone angle to the core length as @xmath242 for hyperbolic cone - manifold structures on @xmath215 .",
    "in particular , near the complete structure , even though @xmath132 and @xmath206 individually approach zero , their _ ratio _ approaches a finite , non - zero value .",
    "the estimate ( [ keybound ] ) implies that , as long as the tube radius is nt too small , @xmath243 is approximately equal to the ratio @xmath244 . in the case of equality",

    "it is therefore of interest to find the smallest volume hyperbolic manifold .",

    "the smallest volume of a hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold with a single cusp is known ( @xcite ) to equal @xmath258 , the volume of the figure eight knot complement .",

    "furthermore , the volumes of these manifolds satisfy the inequality @xmath264 in particular , @xmath265 so that it has larger volume than the closed hyperbolic manifold with the smallest known volume . [ connect ]",
    "in this section we give a brief description of generalizations and applications of the deformation theory described in the previous sections .",
    "the first way in which one could attempt to generalize the harmonic deformation theory is to allow finitely many infinite volume , but geometrically finite , ends in our hyperbolic cone - manifolds @xmath8 . without giving a formal definition ,",
    "this structure provides ends that , asymptotically , are like the ends of smooth geometrically finite hyperbolic @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "we further assume that there are no rank-@xmath6 cusps ( so the ends are like those kleinian groups with _ compact _",
    "convex cores ) .",
    "the term  geometrically finite \" will include this extra assumption throughout this section .",
    "each infinite volume end of such a geometrically finite cone - manifold determines a conformal structure ( in fact a complex projective structure ) on a surface at infinity , which can be used to ( topologically ) compactify the cone - manifold .",
    "we refer to these as _ boundary conformal structures_.    when there is no singular set , then the quasi - conformal deformation theory developed by ahlfors , bers and others ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) implies that such structures are parametrized by these conformal structures at infinity .",
    "in particular , they satisfy local rigidity relative to the boundary conformal structures ; it is not possible locally to vary the hyperbolic structure without varying at least one of the conformal structures at infinity",
    ".    in @xcite bromberg extends the harmonic deformation theory outlined in the previous sections to such geometrically finite cone - manifolds , assuming that the cone angles are at most @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , it is proved there that there are no infinitesimal deformations of such structures that fix both the cone angles and the conformal structures at infinity , i.e. , rigidity rel cone angles and boundary conformal structures .",
    "this generalizes the local theory both for smooth geometrically finite kleinian groups and for finite volume cone - manifolds .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that , since the holonomy groups for these geometrically finite cone - manifold are not usually discrete , the global quasi - conformal theory on the sphere at infinity which is the basis for the smooth ( ahlfors - bers ) theory ca nt be used at all .",
    "so , new techniques are required .",
    "similarly , since the deformation is only assumed to be  conformal at infinity \" , not trivial at infinity , one can not assume that there is a representative of this infinitesimal deformation for which the infinitesimal change of metric is asymptotically trivial .",
    "as a result , the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath67-valued forms representing the deformation must be analyzed at these infinite volume ends as well as near the singular locus .",
    "this makes the proof of the necessary hodge theorem much more difficult . after the hodge theorem",
    "is proved , the final step is to show that there is a harmonic ( hodge ) representative for which the contribution to the weitzenbck boundary term goes to zero near infinity .",
    "this requires some subtle analysis .",
    "once this is established , the analytic results from the finite volume cone - manifold theory go through without change .",
    "in particular , the inequalities ( [ eta0pos ] ) and ( [ normbound ] ) still apply .",
    "once packing arguments , which imply non - degeneration results , are proved in this context , then the dehn filling results , such as theorem [ thm3 ] , can be generalized ( with different numerical values ) .",
    "similarly , there will be an analog , for smooth , geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds , of theorem [ connect ] . recall that this theorem says that a closed",
    ", smooth hyperbolic manifold with a sufficiently short simple closed geodesic can be connected by a family of cone - manifolds to the complete structure on the manifold obtained by removing the geodesic .",
    "such packing and non - degeneration results are proved by bromberg in @xcite .",
    "however , his goal and the goal of subsequent papers by ( various subsets of ) brock , bromberg , evans and souto ( see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is an analytically sharper version of this type of result .",
    "a goal in each of these papers is to approximate structures with very short ( possibly singular ) geodesics by ones with smaller cone angles , including ones with cusps . not only is a path of cone - manifolds connecting the structures needed but this must be constructed so as to bound the distortion of the structure along the way .    as was remarked in section [ effrigid ] , the results in @xcite which we have discussed in the previous sections require only the inequality ( [ eta0pos ] ) .",
    "however , the analysis in that section also led to the inequality ( [ normbound ] ) which bounds the @xmath107 norm of the harmonic representative for the infinitesimal deformation .",
    "further calculations there also provided an upper bound ( [ l2estimate ] ) for this @xmath107 norm in terms of the geometry of the boundary torus .",
    "it is easy to check that , for any given non - zero cone angle , this upper bound will become arbitrarily small as the length of the singular locus goes to zero , assuming there is a lower bound to the tube radius .",
    "this allows one to bound the @xmath107 norm of the harmonic representative @xmath90 of an infinitesimal deformation at such a structure , where we are assuming that the deformation is infinitesimally conformal at infinity on the infinite volume ends .",
    "such deformations are locally parametrized by cone angles . to be consistent with the previous sections , we use the parametrization @xmath207 , where @xmath206 is the cone angle .",
    "then the following theorem holds :    let @xmath8 be a geometrically finite hyperbolic cone - manifold with no rank-@xmath6 cusps and with an embedded tube of radius at least @xmath266 around the singular locus @xmath262 .",
    "suppose that @xmath90 is the harmonic representative of an infinitesimal deformation of @xmath8 as above .",
    "then , for any fixed cone angle @xmath267 and any @xmath268 , there is a length @xmath269 , depending only on @xmath206 and @xmath270 , so that , if the length of @xmath262 is less than @xmath271 , then @xmath272 , for some embedded tube @xmath38 around @xmath262 . [ shortgeo ]",
    "recall that the real part of @xmath90 corresponds to the infinitesimal change in metric induced by the infinitesimal deformation .",
    "so , in particular , the above theorem gives an @xmath107 bound on the size of the infinitesimal change of metric .",
    "however , it is still necessary to bound the change in the hyperbolic structure in a more usable way . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "this was turned into a bound in the change of the projective structures at infinity .",
    "this is sufficient for the applications in those papers . for the applications in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "an upper bound is needed on the bilipschitz constants of maps between structures along the path of cone - manifolds .",
    "for such a bound , it is necessary to turn the @xmath107 bounds on the infinitesimal change of metric into pointwise bounds .",
    "it is then also necessary to extend the bilipschitz maps into the tubes in a way that still has small bilipschitz constant .",
    "this is carried out in @xcite .    the work in @xcite and @xcite globalizes theorem [ shortgeo ] .",
    "it implies that , under the same assumptions , it is possible to find a path of cone - manifolds from the geometrically finite cone - manifold @xmath8 to the complete structure on @xmath8 with the geodesic removed , and that this can be done so that all the geometric structures along the path can be made arbitrarily close to each other . in @xcite",
    "the distance between the structures is measured in terms of projective structures at infinity , whereas in @xcite it is measured by the bilipschitz constant of maps .",
    "since the core geodesic is removed in the cusped structure , the authors call these results `` drilling theorems '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these theorems provide very strong quantitative statements of the qualitative idea that hyperbolic structures with short geodesics are  close \" to ones with cusps .",
    "the careful reader will have noticed that theorem [ shortgeo ] has no conditions on the size of the cone angles whereas the theory in @xcite requires that the cone angles be at most @xmath3 .",
    "as stated , this theorem and hence the full drilling theorem depends on a harmonic deformation theory which has no conditions on the cone angle , but only requires the above lower bound on the tube radius .",
    "such a theory is developed in @xcite .",
    "some uses of the drilling theorem ( e.g. , @xcite ) only involve going from a smooth structure ( cone angle @xmath3 ) to a cusp , so only the analysis in @xcite is needed . however , the proofs of the density conjecture in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , as described in these proceedings ( @xcite ) , require a path of cone - manifolds beginning with cone angle @xmath5 and ending at cone angle @xmath3 , so they depend on the new work in @xcite .    below",
    "we give a brief description of the boundary value problem involved in this new version of the harmonic deformation theory , as well as some applications to finite volume hyperbolic cone - manifolds .",
    "we will assume , for simplicity , that @xmath8 is a compact hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold with a single torus as its boundary .",
    "hyperbolic manifolds with multiple torus boundary components can be handled by using the same type of boundary conditions on each one .",
    "the theory extends to hyperbolic manifolds which also have infinite volume geometrically finite ends , whose conformal structure at infinity is assumed to be fixed , using the same techniques as in @xcite .",
    "we further assume that the geometry near each boundary torus is modelled on the _ complement _ of an open tubular neighborhood of radius @xmath123 around the singular set of a hyperbolic cone - manifold .",
    "( a horospherical neighborhood of a cusp is included by allowing @xmath273 . ) in particular , we assume that each torus has an intrinsic flat metric with constant principal normal curvatures @xmath274 and @xmath275 , where @xmath276",
    ". the normal curvatures and the tube radius , @xmath123 , are related by @xmath277 so they determine each other .",
    "in fact , given such a boundary structure , it can be canonically filled in . in general , the filled - in structure has `` dehn surgery type singularities '' ( see ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "4 ) ) , which includes cone singularities with arbitrary cone angle .",
    "we say that @xmath8 has _",
    "tubular boundary_. this structure is described in more detail in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "specific closed @xmath67-valued @xmath6-forms , defined in a neighborhood of the singular locus , were exhibited which had the property that some complex linear combination of them induced every possible infinitesimal change in the holonomy representation of a boundary torus . as a result , by standard cohomology theory , for any infinitesimal deformation of the hyperbolic structure , it is possible to find a closed @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form @xmath278 on @xmath8 which equals such a complex linear combination of these standard forms in a neighborhood of the torus boundary .",
    "this combination of standard forms corresponds to the terms @xmath279 in equation ( [ omegadecomp ] ) in section [ infharm ] .",
    "the standard forms are harmonic so the @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form @xmath278 will be harmonic in a neighborhood of the boundary but not generally harmonic on all of @xmath8 . since it represents a cohomology class in @xmath147 , it will be closed as an @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form , but it wo nt generally be co - closed . if we denote by @xmath280 and @xmath281 the exterior derivative and its adjoint on @xmath67-valued forms , then this means that @xmath282 , but @xmath283 in general .",
    "( note that @xmath67 is a flat bundle so that @xmath280 is the coboundary operator for this cohomology theory . )",
    "a representative for a cohomology class can be altered by a coboundary without changing its cohomology class .",
    "an @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form is a coboundary precisely when it can be expressed as @xmath284 , where @xmath80 is an @xmath67-valued @xmath2-form , i.e. a _ global _ section of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , finding a harmonic ( closed and co - closed ) representative cohomologous to @xmath278 is equivalent to finding a section @xmath80 such that @xmath285 then , @xmath286 satisfies @xmath287 ; it is a closed and co - closed ( hence harmonic ) representative in the same cohomology class as @xmath278 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in order to solve equation ( [ correction ] ) for @xmath67-valued sections , it suffices to solve it for the  real part \" of @xmath67 , where we are interpreting @xmath67 as the complexified tangent bundle of @xmath8 as discussed at the end of section [ infharm ] .",
    "the real part of a section @xmath80 of @xmath67 is just a ( real ) section of the tangent bundle of @xmath8 ; i.e. , a vector field , which we denote by @xmath50 .",
    "the real part of @xmath288 equals @xmath289 , where @xmath290 denotes the ( riemannian ) covariant derivative and @xmath291 is its adjoint .",
    "the composition @xmath292 is sometimes called the  rough laplacian \" or the  connection laplacian \" .",
    "we will denote it by @xmath293 .    to solve the equation @xmath294 ,",
    "we take the real part of @xmath295 , considered as a vector field , and denote it by @xmath296 .",
    "we then solve the equation @xmath297 for a vector field @xmath50 on @xmath8 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this gives rise to a section @xmath80 of @xmath67 whose real part equals @xmath50 which is a solution to ( [ correction ] ) .",
    "we denote the correction term @xmath284 by @xmath146 . in a neighborhood of the boundary",
    "@xmath278 equals a combination of standard forms , @xmath279 .",
    "thus , in a neighborhood of the boundary , we can decompose the harmonic representative @xmath90 as @xmath298 , just as we did in ( [ omegadecomp ] ) in section [ infharm ] .",
    "note that , since @xmath278 was already harmonic in a neighborhood of the boundary , the correction term @xmath146 will also be harmonic on that neighborhood .    because @xmath90 is harmonic",
    ", it will satisfy weitzenbck formulae as described in section [ effrigid ] .",
    "as will be outlined below we will choose boundary conditions that will further guarantee that @xmath299 where @xmath60 is a @xmath6-form with values in the tangent bundle of @xmath8 .",
    "it decomposes as @xmath160 in a neighborhood of the boundary and satisfies the equation @xmath300 on all of @xmath8 . as before , taking an @xmath107 inner product and integrating by parts leads to equation ( [ bdryeq ] ) .",
    "the key to generalizing the harmonic deformation theory from the previous sections is finding boundary conditions that will guarantee that the contribution to the boundary term of ( [ bdryeq ] ) from the correction term @xmath127 will be _ non - positive_. once this is established , everything else goes through without change .    in order to control the behavior of @xmath301 ( hence of @xmath127 ) ,",
    "it is necessary to put restrictions on the domain of the operator @xmath302 in equation ( [ vfeqn ] ) . on smooth vector fields with compact support",
    "the operator @xmath302 is self - adjoint .",
    "it is natural to look for boundary conditions for which self - adjointness still holds .",
    "it is possible to find boundary conditions which make this operator elliptic and self - adjoint with trivial kernel .",
    "standard theory then implies that equation ( [ vfeqn ] ) is always uniquely solvable .",
    "there are many choices for such boundary data .",
    "standard examples include the conditions that either @xmath50 or its normal derivative be zero , analogous to dirichlet and neumann conditions for the laplacian on real - valued functions .",
    "however , none of these standard choices of boundary data have the key property that the weitzenbck boundary term for @xmath127 will necessarily be non - positive .",
    "the main analytic result in @xcite is the construction of a boundary value problem that has this key additional property .",
    "we give a very brief description of the boundary conditions involved .",
    "( in particular , we will avoid discussion of the precise function spaces involved . )    the first boundary condition on the vector fields allowed in the domain of the operator @xmath302 in equation ( [ vfeqn ] ) is that its ( @xmath1-dimensional ) divergence vanish on the boundary .",
    "this means that the corresponding infinitesimal change of metric is volume preserving at points on the boundary .",
    "the combination of standard forms , @xmath303 , also induces infinitesimally volume preserving deformations .",
    "once we prove the existence of a harmonic @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form @xmath90 whose correction term comes from a vector field satisfying this boundary condition , we can conclude that @xmath90 is infinitesimally volume preserving at the boundary .",
    "if we denote by @xmath304 the function measuring the infinitesimal change of volume at a point , then this means that @xmath304 vanishes at the boundary .",
    "however , for any harmonic @xmath67-valued @xmath6-form @xmath304 satisfies the equation : @xmath305 where @xmath293 here denotes the laplacian on functions given locally by the sum of the _ negatives _ of the second derivatives .    a standard integration by parts argument shows that any function satisfying such an equation and vanishing at the boundary must be identically zero .",
    "thus we can conclude that the deformation induced by @xmath90 is infinitesimally volume preserving at _ every _ point in @xmath8 .",
    "this allows us to conclude that @xmath90 can be written as @xmath299 where @xmath60 satisfies @xmath300 .",
    "( see proposition 2.6 in @xcite . )",
    "the computation of the weitzenbck boundary term now proceeds as before .",
    "the second boundary condition is more complicated to describe .",
    "recall that the boundary of @xmath8 has the same structure as the boundary of a tubular neighborhood of a ( possibly singular ) geodesic .",
    "in particular , it has a neighborhood which is foliated by tori which are equidistant from the boundary . in a sufficiently small neighborhood ,",
    "these surfaces are all embedded and , on each of them , the nearest point projection to the boundary is a diffeomorphism .",
    "if we denote by @xmath306 the ( @xmath106-dimensional ) tangential component of the vector field @xmath50 at the boundary , we can use these projection maps to pull back @xmath306 to these equidistant surfaces .",
    "we denote the resulting extension of @xmath306 to the neighborhood of the boundary by @xmath307 .    in dimension @xmath1 , the _ curl _ of a vector field is again a @xmath1-dimensional vector field .",
    "the second boundary condition is that the ( @xmath106-dimensional ) tangential component of @xmath308 agree with that of @xmath309 on the boundary .",
    "note that , on the boundary , the normal component of @xmath308 equals the curl of the @xmath106-dimensional vector field @xmath306 ( this curl is a function ) so it automatically agrees with that of @xmath307 .    as a partial motivation for this condition , consider a vector field which generates an infinitesimal isometry in a neighborhood of the boundary which preserves the boundary as a set .",
    "geometrically , it just translates the boundary and all of the nearby equidistant surfaces along themselves .",
    "thus , this vector field is tangent to the boundary and to all the equidistant surfaces .",
    "it has the property that it equals the vector field @xmath307 defined above as the extension of its tangential boundary values .",
    "thus , the above condition can be viewed as an attempt to mirror properties of infinitesimal isometries preserving the boundary .    to see why it might be natural to put conditions on the _ curl _ of @xmath50 , rather than on @xmath50 itself , consider the real - valued @xmath6-form @xmath262 dual ( using the hyperbolic metric ) to @xmath50 .",
    "then , @xmath310 and @xmath311 correspond , respectively , to the divergence and curl of @xmath50 , where @xmath312 denotes exterior derivative , @xmath271 its adjoint , and @xmath313 is the hodge star - operator .",
    "our boundary conditions can be viewed as conditions on the exterior derivative and its adjoint applied to this dual @xmath6-form .",
    "however , the ultimate justification for these boundary conditions is that they lead to a weitzenbck boundary term with the correct properties , as long as the tube radius is sufficiently large . a direct geometric proof of this fact is still lacking , as is an understanding of the geometric significance of the value of the required lower bound on the tube radius .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that the contribution to the weitzenbck boundary from the correction term @xmath146 is always non - positive when it arises from a vector field satisfying these boundary conditions can be derived by straightforward ( though somewhat intricate ) calculation .",
    "all the results from the previous harmonic theory follow immediately .",
    "for example , we can conclude :    for a finite volume hyperbolic cone - manifold with singularities along a link with tube radius at least @xmath314 , there are no deformations of the hyperbolic structure keeping the cone angles fixed .",
    "furthermore , the nearby hyperbolic cone - manifold structures are parametrized by their cone angles .",
    "[ bdrylocalparam ]    in the statement of this theorem , when the singular link has more than one component , having tube radius at least @xmath123 means that there are disjoint embedded tubes of radius @xmath123 around all the components .    besides being able to extend local rigidity rel cone angles and parametrization by cone angles",
    ", the boundary value theory permits all of the estimates involved in the effective rigidity arguments to go through .",
    "in particular , inequalities ( [ eta0pos ] ) , ( [ normbound ] ) , and ( [ keybound ] ) continue to hold .",
    "the packing arguments require no restriction on cone angles so that the proofs of the results on hyperbolic dehn surgery ( e.g. , theorems [ thm3 ] and [ thm4 ] ) go through unchanged .    in order to give an efficient description of the conclusions of these arguments in this more general context",
    "we first extend some previous definitions . recall that , if @xmath8 has a complete finite volume hyperbolic structure with one cusp and @xmath245 is an embedded horospherical torus , the normalized length of a simple closed curve @xmath101 on @xmath245 is defined as the length of the geodesic isotopic to @xmath101 in the flat metric on @xmath245 , scaled to have area @xmath6 . a _ weighted _ simple closed curve is just a pair , @xmath315 , where @xmath316 is a positive real number .",
    "its normalized length is then defined to be @xmath316 times the normalized length of @xmath101 .",
    "if a basis is chosen for @xmath317 , the set of isotopy classes of non - contractible simple closed curves on @xmath245 corresponds to pairs @xmath217 of relatively prime integers .",
    "then a weighted simple closed curve @xmath315 can be identified with the point @xmath318 .",
    "it is easy to check that the notion of normalized length extends by continuity to any @xmath319 .",
    "the _ hyperbolic dehn surgery space _ for @xmath8 ( denoted @xmath320 ) is a subset of @xmath321 which serves as a parameter space for ( generally incomplete ) hyperbolic structures on @xmath8 ( with certain restrictions on the structure near its end ) .",
    "in particular , if we view a weighted simple closed curve @xmath315 as an element of @xmath322 , then saying that it is in @xmath320 means that there is a hyperbolic cone - manifold structure on the manifold obtained from @xmath8 by doing dehn filling with @xmath101 as meridian which has the core curve as the singular locus with cone angle @xmath323 .",
    "the point at infinity corresponds to the complete hyperbolic structure on @xmath8 .",
    "thurston s hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem ( see @xcite ) states that @xmath320 always contains an open neighborhood of @xmath324 .",
    "this , in particular , implies that it contains all but a finite number of pairs @xmath217 of relatively prime integers , which implies that all but a finite number of the manifolds obtained by ( topological ) dehn surgery are hyperbolic .",
    "however , since most of these pairs are clustered  near \" infinity , the statement that it contains an open neighborhood of infinity is considerably stronger .",
    "again , thurston s proof is not effective ; it provides no information about the size of any region contained in hyperbolic dehn surgery space . the following theorem , whose proof is analogous to that of theorem [ thm3 ] provides such information :    [ shapethm ] let @xmath8 be a complete , finite volume orientable hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold with one cusp , and let @xmath245 be a horospherical torus which is embedded as a cross - section to the cusp of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath325 have normalized length at least @xmath326 .",
    "then there is a hyperbolic structure on @xmath8 with dehn surgery coefficient @xmath327 . in particular , the hyperbolic dehn surgery space for @xmath8 contains the complement of the ellipse around the origin determined by the condition that the normalized length of @xmath327 is less than @xmath326 .",
    "furthermore , the volumes of hyperbolic structures in this region differ from that of @xmath8 by at most @xmath328    * remark : * the homology group @xmath322 can be naturally identified with the universal cover of @xmath245 so the flat metric on @xmath245 , normalized to have area @xmath6 , induces a flat metric on @xmath322 .",
    "then the ellipse in the above theorem becomes a metric disk of radius @xmath326 . from this point of view",
    ", the theorem provides a universal size region in @xmath320 ( the complement of a  round disk \" of radius @xmath326 ) , which is _ independent _ of @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is perhaps more interesting to note that , if @xmath322 is more naturally identified with @xmath329 , then this region actually reflects the _ shape _ of @xmath245 .",
    "finally we note that these techniques also provide good estimates on the change in geometry during hyperbolic dehn filling as in theorem [ shapethm ] .",
    "for example , schlfli s formula ( [ schlafli ] ) together with control on the length of the singular locus ( as in theorem [ keyboundtheorem ] ) leads to explicit upper and lower bounds for the decrease in volume , @xmath330 .",
    "these bounds are independent of the cusped manifold @xmath8 , and can be viewed as refinements of the asymptotic formula of neumann and zagier @xcite : @xmath331 where @xmath332 denotes the normalized length of the dehn surgery coefficient @xmath333 .",
