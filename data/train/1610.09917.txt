    "in 1878 , edwin hall designed an experiment aiming at measuring the change of electrical resistance in a thin gold leaf , in the presence of a steady magnetic field .",
    "he found that the magnetic field permanently altered the charge distribution , with a transverse potential difference @xcite .",
    "the hall conductance was defined as the longitudinal current divided by the transverse voltage .",
    "the magnitude and even the sign of the hall voltage was found to be material - dependent , making the hall effect  ( he ) a useful characterization tool for inspecting the transport properties ( including the nature of charge carriers , electron versus holes ) in a given solid .",
    "the classical hall resistivity follows a typical law with charge density as @xmath1 .",
    "the quantum hall effect  ( qhe ) was further discovered in 1980 at the high magnetic field laboratory in grenoble ( france ) by klaus von klitzing , who was measuring the hall conductance of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the ultralow temperature regime , more precisely in si(100 ) mos inversion layers at @xmath2 t and @xmath3 k @xcite .",
    "von klitzing found that the hall conductance exhibited a staircase sequence of wide plateaus as a function of the strength of an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the 2deg , that is @xmath4 with @xmath5 the universal von klitzing resistance constant and @xmath6 .",
    "this quantization is of incredible precision ( 1 part in @xmath7 ) , vanishingly sensitive to measurement geometry and material degree of imperfection . since 1990 , the _",
    "von klitzing resistance constant _ stands as the international standard for resistance calibrations . in 1985",
    ", von klitzing was awarded the physics nobel prize for the discovery of the integer qhe @xcite .    in the quantum hall regime",
    ", the hall conductivity @xmath8 is thus also quantized @xmath9 , while the longitudinal conductivity becomes vanishingly small @xmath10 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath11 in @xmath8 is the filling factor , and is either an integer number ( @xmath12 ) or a fractional number ( @xmath13 . the integer qhe is explained in terms of single - particle orbitals of an electron in a magnetic field and is related to the landau quantization .",
    "differently , the fractional qhe fundamentally relies on strong electron - electron interactions , and the existence of so - called charge - flux composites known as composite fermions @xcite .    the spin hall effect  ( she ) was predicted theoretically by dyakonov and perel in 1971 @xcite , as the formation of spin accumulation on the lateral surfaces of an electric current - carrying sample , the signs of the spin directions being reversed at opposite boundaries .",
    "differently from the case of classical he , where opposite charges accumulate at the boundaries as a result of the lorentz force generated by an external magnetic field , the formation of she takes place in the absence of magnetic field and is driven by spin - orbit coupling  ( soc ) either through scattering off impurities ( extrinsic she ) or spin - split band structure ( intrinsic she ) @xcite .",
    "the she belongs to the same family as the anomalous he , known for a long time in ferromagnets , which originates from the combined effect of soc and magnetization ( in fact , she can be viewed as the zero magnetization limit of anomalous he ) @xcite .    the experimental confirmation of she detection has been first achieved by optical spectroscopy , in both the extrinsic regime @xcite and the intrinsic regime @xcite . then the electrical detection was accomplished using the inverse she ( ishe ) by saitoh and coworkers @xcite , valenzuela and tinkham @xcite , and zhao and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the ishe , which is onsager reciprocal of direct she , measures a charge imbalance at the sample edges resulting from injection of pure spin current or spin - polarized charge current into a spin - orbit - coupled sample . despite being observed only a decade ago ,",
    "these effects are already ubiquitous within spintronics , as standard spin - current generators and detectors @xcite .    in 2005 ,",
    "kane and mele predicted the possibility of the quantum spin hall effect  ( qshe ) in graphene due to intrinsic soc @xcite . within the qshe , the presence of soc results in the formation of chiral edge channels for spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "the observation of the qshe has been however jeopardized in clean graphene owing to vanishingly small intrinsic soc on order of @xmath14ev @xcite , but demonstrated in strong soc materials ( such as cdte / hgte / cdte quantum wells or bismuth selenide and telluride alloys ) , giving rise to the new exciting field of _ topological insulators _",

    "finally , well - separated in momentum space degenerate valleys of energy bands ( in graphene and other two - dimensional materials ) constitute a discrete degree of freedom for low - energy carriers with long intervalley relaxation time .",
    "the valley degree of freedom may be used as a non - volatile information carrier , provided that it can be coupled to external probes . in the presence of inversion symmetry breaking in graphene  for instance having graphene onto a substrate such as hexagonal boron - nitride ( h - bn)the valley index plays a similar role as spin in conventional semiconductors , driving towards quantum phenomena such as hall transport , magnetization , optical transition selection rules , and chiral edge modes @xcite .",
    "these make possible the control of valley dynamics by magnetic , electric , and optical means , which form the basis of valley based information processing .    beyond graphene",
    ", valley hall physics also occurs in two - dimensional semiconductors such as @xmath16 monolayers and other group vi transition metal dichalcogenides , which are direct bandgap semiconductors with band edges located at the @xmath17 points .",
    "the low energy electrons and holes are well described by massive dirac fermions with strong spin - valley coupling . in analogy to the classical hall and the she , the valley hall effect  ( vhe ) is theoretically determined by different valley currents moving in opposite directions perpendicular to the drift current . moreover",
    ", the large soc in the valence band causes valley - spin locking , whereby optically excited valley populations are also spin polarized , and valley accumulation at sample edges is accompanied by spin accumulation @xcite .",
    "such a coexistence of vhe and she could make possible valley and spin controls for potential integrated spintronics and valleytronics applications on this platform . to date , vhe has only been directly observed in highly disordered @xmath18-supported ( low - quality ) mos@xmath19 samples @xcite .",
    "the exact quantization of the ( charge and spin ) hall conductivities and their robustness against disorder are direct consequence of the specific topological nature of the system band structure .",
    "the discovery of the berry curvature @xcite revealed the deep connection between certain aspects of condensed matter and differential geometry , whose important effects are partly illustrated in the rest of this section . in particular , we will show that the transport properties of quantum hall systems can be obtained in terms of topological invariant quantities , which characterize the wave functions and do not vary under continuous deformations of the system . a popular analogy to illustrate this concept is offered by knot theory .",

    "the existence of a topological invariant ( chern number ) is a direct consequence of the known _ failure of parallel transport around a closed loop _ , which is measured by the berry phase .",
    "the local adiabatic curvature of the bundle of ground states in the parameter space is then defined as the limit of berry phase mismatch divided by the loop area ( see [ avron ] for pedagogical introduction ) .",
    "the chern number is a topological invariant in the sense that its value is unchanged under small changes in the hamiltonian ( due for instance to disorder perturbation ) .",
    "however , when large deformations of the hamiltonian are taking place , the wave function ground state can cross over other eigenstates , and such a level crossing triggers transitions between chern numbers and hall conductance plateaus .",
    "this topological interpretation of the quantized hall conductivity stands as a major milestone for the understanding of qhe , but has also generated many inspired subsequent developments of topological physics in condensed matter .",
    "the electronic transport properties of graphene are known to be very peculiar @xcite with unprecedented manifestations of quantum phenomena as klein tunneling , weak antilocalization , or anomalous qhe , all driven by the additional degree of freedom ( pseudospin ) and related @xmath53-berry phase endowed by the bipartite nature of graphene and its sublattice degeneracy @xcite .",

    "the effect of magnetic impurities was also proposed to jeopardize long spin - diffusion lengths , but the predicted ey mechanism does not consistently account for all experimental observations @xcite .    reference  [ ] has proposed that small spin relaxation time in graphene could be explained by resonant scattering off local magnetic moments . a completely different mechanism ",
    "spin - pseudospin entanglement @xcite  which is specific to graphene was unveiled by quantum simulations of spin dynamics in disordered graphene with rashba soc due to substrate - induced electric field or small density of metallic adatoms ( such as gold or nickel ) .",
    "such a mechanism results from the entangled dynamics of spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom , which is particularly predominant close to the cnp @xcite .",

    "such a spin - pseudospin locking effect results in a fast spin dephasing , even when approaching the ballistic limit @xcite , with increasing spin lifetimes away from the cnp , as observed experimentally @xcite . depending on the type of substrate ( silicon oxide or h - bn ) , the impact of disorder ( through electron - hole puddles ) was found to yield either a dp or an ey - type of spin relaxation .",

    "the dispersive bands correspond to edge states with opposite group velocity , whose direction and intensity is proportional to the energy band derivative with respect to the wave number .",

    "this is why the bottom edge channel is not visible in the figure .",
    "as long as these two channels do not come into contact ( i.e. they keep the spatial chirality ) , the backscattering is suppressed and the conductance is quantized .",
    "the large spatial separation between them thus explains the robustness of the quantum hall effect . to better clarify this point ,",

    "[ fig : fig_iqhe_zigzag](b ) .",
    "we can see that , especially at low energies , the conductance remains quantized over large energy ranges .",
    "this means that the spatial deviation of the current due to disorder is not large enough to break spatial chirality . on the contrary , at the energies where the conductance is not quantized , electrons are ( partially ) deviated from the top edge to the bottom one .",
    "such a picture is confirmed by the local spectral currents shown in fig .",

    "<S> the discovery of the integer quantum hall effect in the early eighties of the last century , with highly precise quantization values for the hall conductance in multiples of @xmath0 , has been the first fascinating manifestation of the topological state of matter driven by magnetic field and disorder , and related to the formation of non - dissipative current flow . in 2005 </S>",
    "<S> , several new phenomena such as the spin hall effect  and the quantum spin hall effect  were predicted in the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling and vanishing external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the zeeman spin hall effect and the formation of valley hall topological currents have been introduced for graphene - based systems , under time - reversal or inversion symmetry - breaking conditions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this review presents a comprehensive coverage of all these hall effects in disordered graphene from the perspective of numerical simulations of quantum transport in two - dimensional bulk systems ( by means of the kubo formalism ) and multiterminal nanostructures ( by means of the landauer - bttiker scattering and nonequilibrium green function approaches ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to usual two - dimensional electron gases , the presence of defects in graphene generates more complex electronic features such as electron - hole asymmetry , defect resonances or percolation effect between localized impurity states , which , together with extra degrees of freedom ( sublattice pseudospin , valley isospin ) , bring a higher degree of complexity and enlarge the transport phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium spectral current distribution in a 100 nm wide graphene ribbon at an energy between the first and the second landau levels in the presence of a gaussian potential impurity . </S>",
    "<S> the current flows along edge states in opposite directions and it circumvents the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> some small current reaches the bottom edge thus breaking spatial chirality of currents and being backscattered . </S>"
