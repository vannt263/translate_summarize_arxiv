    "after the completion of the nlo virtual corrections @xcite , the next step in our program of computing the virtual photon impact factor in next - to - leading order is the calculation of the emission of a real gluon , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : contribif ] .",
    "we will compute these corrections from the high energy limit of the process @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qqgkin ] ) at leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in the region of phase space , were the @xmath5-pair and the @xmath6 are emitted in the fragmentation region of the virtual photon with a large rapidity gap relative to the outgoing lower quark .",
    "we impose no further restrictions on the mass of the @xmath7-state , and therefore our results will also include the production of the gluon in the central region : this corresponds to the leading - order bfkl calculation , where the gluon is emitted with a large rapidity gap relative to both the lower quark and to the upper @xmath5-pair . for the calculation of the photon impact factor , this piece has to be subtracted from our results .    a study of the process @xmath8 includes the subprocess @xmath9 with an off - shell incoming gluon .",
    "together with the nlo corrections to the production process @xmath10 which has been calculated in @xcite , it provides the complete nlo corrections to the photon - gluon fusion process with off - shell incoming bosons .",
    "this generalizes the usual on - shell calculation of the collinear factorization scheme to the @xmath11-factorization scheme @xcite . during the last years evidence",
    "has been collected that , for certain final states in the small-@xmath12 region , the use of this scheme provides a better description of hera data than the traditional collinear factorization scheme : for the modeling of final states it is therefore important to have the off - shell photon - gluon fusion not only in lo but also in nlo .",
    "finally , it is well - known that the leading order photon impact factor can be interpreted in terms of the photon wave function and a color dipole cross section @xcite . in recent years",
    "this color dipole picture has proven to be extremely useful for analyzing hera data in the small-@xmath12 region , in particular the low-@xmath13 region of the @xmath14 structure function and the diffractive final states @xcite .",
    "the validity of the color dipole picture ( or , maybe , its generalization to higher multipole terms ) beyond leading order therefore presents an issue which has to be investigated . in nlo ,",
    "the validity of the photon wave function picture is one of the results that should come out of the nlo photon impact factor calculation : in the interpretation of our results we will therefore pay particular attention to this aspect .",
    "the notations of the scattering process are depicted in fig  [ fig : qqgkin ] .",
    "the incoming momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 are used to construct the sudakov basis @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 ) for the other momenta , and @xmath19 denotes the center of mass energy of the incoming particles .",
    "the virtuality of the photon is @xmath20 , and as usual , @xmath21 .",
    "the momentum transfer is denoted by @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) , the outgoing gluon carries momentum @xmath24 and the momenta of the quark and antiquark are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we express these momenta in terms of their sudakov variables , @xmath27 where the euclidean notation is used for the two dimensional transverse momenta , e.g.  @xmath28 .",
    "we are interested in the limit of large energy @xmath29 : @xmath29 has to be much larger than @xmath13 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and the @xmath33 variables of the @xmath1-system are of the order unity .",
    "the regions of integration are @xmath34    for the produced gluon we require a large rapidity gap between the gluon and the lower quark . in other words , we include both the fragmentation region of the virtual photon @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 denotes a small but energy independent cutoff parameter to be specified later ) , and the ` upper ' part of the central region @xmath37 there is a remaining part of the phase space which we do not consider : the ` lower ' half of the central region : @xmath38 and the fragmentation region of the lower quark .",
    "the central region belongs to the lo bfkl calculation , whereas the fragmentation region of the lower quark is part of the quark impact factor @xcite .",
    "the definition of the ` upper ' and ` lower ' parts of the central region is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we have chosen the ` symmetric ' separation : @xmath39 corresponds to the symmetric point @xmath40 .    from the on - shell conditions of the outgoing quarks and gluons we obtain @xmath41 and @xmath42 the feynman diagrams are listed in fig .",
    "[ fig : realgraphs ] .",
    "the graphs in the second line ( denoted by @xmath43 ) are obtained from the diagrams of the first line ( @xmath44 ) by interchanging the quark and antiquark , i.e. by transforming @xmath45 . in terms of the sudakov components",
    "this transformation reads :    @xmath46    in correspondence with this transformation we introduce the shorthand notation : @xmath47 where the bars stand for the transformation , .",
    "the denominators , that will occur during the calculation , have the form : @xmath48 under the transformation ",
    "the denominators @xmath49 to @xmath50 obey the following relations : @xmath51    rather than beginning with the scattering amplitude we immediately turn to the squared matrix elements , averaged ( summed ) over the helicities and color of incoming ( outgoing ) quarks .",
    "the polarization vectors of the photon are @xmath52 in fact , since @xmath53 , we make use of gauge invariance and simply put @xmath54 . in this paper we restrict ourselves to the longitudinal polarization ; the transverse case will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "our calculations are performed in the feynman gauge . as to the internal ( @xmath55-channel ) gluon numerators , we use the decomposition @xmath56 in the high energy limit we retain only the first term , since the contributions of the other terms will be suppressed by powers of @xmath57 . for the diagrams where the produced gluon couples to the lower fermion line , this may not be immediately obvious , since some of the light cone components of the @xmath55 channel gluon are not small ; we have checked the approximation against a calculation involving the full numerator , and we have obtained the same answer . in the diagrams @xmath58 and @xmath59 we have combined two feynman graphs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : effvertex ] ) into one effective diagram .",
    "since the produced gluon is far from the lower quark in rapidity , we can simplify the emission vertex :    @xmath60 u(p , h )       \\approx \\frac{2 p^\\lambda}{\\alpha_\\ell}[t^c , t^a ]    \\delta_{hh'}\\;.\\ ] ]    here we have used that @xmath24 has large components only in the @xmath61 direction ; @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the helicities of the lower incoming and outgoing quarks , respectively , and the lorentz index @xmath64 is to be contracted with the polarization vector of the outgoing gluon with color index @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 are the color group generators in the fundamental representation , and @xmath68 denotes the color index carried by the @xmath55-channel gluon .",
    "the result for the helicity - summed square of the matrix element ( averaged over helicity and color of the incoming quark ) has the following form : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the charge of quark flavour @xmath71 , and @xmath6 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "following the labeling of fig .",
    "[ fig : realgraphs ] we denote the product of graph @xmath72 with graph @xmath73 by @xmath74 etc .",
    "furthermore , the phase space over the final state ( including the @xmath75-functions from the on - shell conditions ) is given by : @xmath76 @xmath77 denotes the space time dimension .",
    "we calculate our results in dimensional regularization with transverse dimension @xmath78 .",
    "the sum on the rhs of , together with the phase space and the flux factor @xmath79 represents the ( helicity - summed ) cross section of the process @xmath80 : @xmath81 the nlo real corrections to the photon impact factor will be obtained from the sum on the rhs of by doing the integral over the @xmath82 phase space and invariant mass .",
    "however , we will have to subtract the production of the gluon in the central region ( multiregge kinematics ) .",
    "this piece belongs to the lo bfkl calculation and must not be counted twice ( see below ) . integrating over the momentum of the outgoing gluon leads to infrared singularities which cancel against the infrared singularities of the virtual corrections @xcite .",
    "since the calculation of the virtual corrections has been done using the dimensional regularization , we will use these same techniques also for the real corrections .    in order to obtain the nlo jet cross section for the off - shell photon - gluon fusion process @xmath83 ) , we have to combine the sum in with the virtual nlo corrections to @xmath84 , using a suitable jet definition .",
    "in this section we list our results for the helicity - summed matrix element .",
    "the traces have been calculated with the help of the mathematica package feyncalc @xcite .",
    "the results have then been simplified further by casting them into a factorizing form : in order to have the photon wave function interpretation we have tried to find a representation in which each term @xmath74 can be written as a sum of products of two terms : one factor belongs to the incoming photon , the other one to the outgoing photon , and in between we have a piece which belongs to the cross section which describes the interaction of the @xmath85-system with the lower quark .",
    "after some algebra we arrive at the following results : @xmath86 @xmath87 here we have used the following abbreviations : @xmath88 in the above definitions , the vectors @xmath89 are obtained from the @xmath90 by the transformations , .",
    "note also the additional relations @xmath91    the remaining terms @xmath74 ( with @xmath92 ) and @xmath93 ( with @xmath92 ) follow from the symmetry properties @xmath94 and @xmath95 ; in order to find @xmath93 and @xmath96 ( with @xmath97 ) , and all the @xmath98 s we use the substitutions , .",
    "we finally note that in the sum of the four @xmath99 matrix elements : @xmath100 , the term proportional to @xmath101 in @xmath102 , the terms proportional to @xmath101 and @xmath50 in @xmath103 , and the analogous terms in @xmath104 and @xmath105 cancel against each other",
    ".    an important feature of the results  is the ultraviolet behavior of transverse momenta : individual terms , namely @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 go as @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "when integrating over @xmath117 , they lead to logarithmic divergencies . however ,",
    "in the sum these divergencies cancel , and all transverse momentum integrals are ultraviolet finite .",
    "as we have discussed in the beginning of section ii , our results are valid in the fragmentation region of the photon and in the ` upper ' part of the central region .",
    "before we move on to any further evaluation of our results we have to address the question of how to remove the central region .",
    "let us , therefore , first study the limit where the emitted gluon belongs to the central rapidity region : @xmath118 in this limit we should find agreement with the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "first of all , we note that the phase space integral in contains a factor @xmath119 : this makes the @xmath120 integral divergent , since , as we will see , some of the @xmath74 have a finite but non vanishing limit for @xmath121 .",
    "let us see how this works in detail . in the limit of small @xmath120 ,",
    "the denominators @xmath122 (  ) are expressed in terms of the two denominators @xmath101 and @xmath50 ; they in turn are closely related to the denominators @xmath123 and @xmath124 , that are well known from the born approximation : @xmath125 in the numerators on the rhs of  we expand in powers of @xmath126 and keep only the leading term . the contributions from the diagrams containing @xmath127 or @xmath128 drop out completely , since they involve an extra fermion propagator that gives a suppression by a power of @xmath126 .",
    "similarly the diagrams with @xmath129 , @xmath130 ( or @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) on both sides .",
    "nonzero contributions come from diagrams involving @xmath133 or @xmath134 , but they cancel in the sum .",
    "we are finally left with the contributions coming from @xmath135 and @xmath136 . as to the @xmath74-terms ,",
    "all non vanishing terms have the common factor @xmath137 ; all non vanishing @xmath138 terms contain @xmath139 .",
    "for the sum on the rhs of we find the simplified form @xmath140 here , @xmath141 is the square of the leading order ( longitudinal ) photon wave function",
    ". the matrix @xmath142 does not discriminate between the coupling of the @xmath55-channel gluon to the upper quark or antiquark lines , i.e.  the difference between @xmath143 and @xmath144 is contained entirely inside the photon wave function .",
    "the matrix itself has the rather simple form @xmath145 the sum of all diagrams is then given by @xmath146 this is exactly what we expect : the factor @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the propagators of the reggeized gluons in the @xmath55-channel , and @xmath149 is the square of the lipatov vertex @xcite . finally , @xmath150 is the lla quark impact factor ( averaged ( summed ) over initial ( final ) colors and helicities ) .",
    "together with the @xmath120 integral in the region which gives a ln-@xmath29 factor , we recover the lo bfkl result .",
    "this demonstrates that our results correctly reproduce the central region of the produced gluon",
    ". it may be interesting to note that may also be written in the factorized form : @xmath151\\cdot    \\left [      \\frac{\\bm r- \\bm\\ell}{(\\bm r- \\bm\\ell)^2 }      +      \\frac{\\bm\\ell}{\\bm\\ell^2}\\ ,    \\right ]    \\frac{1}{\\bm r^4}\\ ,    \\frac{g^2\\delta^{ab}}{2n_c}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this way it has the same structure as  : a product of two terms , one belonging to the incoming photon , one to the outgoing .    in order to avoid",
    "double counting we have to remove this central region from our results .",
    "details of this subtraction procedure will be presented elsewhere , here we only sketch the general argument @xcite .",
    "consider , as an example , the contribution @xmath152 which , as @xmath153 , has a non vanishing limit .",
    "the integral over @xmath120 diverges logarithmically , but the @xmath154-piece belongs to the lo bfkl calculation .",
    "we therefore decompose : @xmath155 + \\a\\a_{15}(0 ) \\ln(\\sqrt{s } \\frac{\\alpha_{\\ell\\;0}}{|\\bm \\ell|})\\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 denotes an energy independent scale much smaller than unity which may depend upon the other momenta , e.g. @xmath157 . as an example",
    ", we could define , as the boundary between the fragmentation region of the photon and the central region , a cutoff on the invariant mass of the @xmath85 system , @xmath158 , which we choose to be larger than @xmath13 , @xmath31 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 . in this case",
    "@xmath159 . in the first term on the rhs",
    ", we can safely put to zero the lower limit of integration ( the error is of order @xmath160 ) , the second term is part of the lo bfkl calculation , now with a definite scale inside the logarithm .",
    "this example illustrates the rle of the energy scale within the result of the nlo calculation : a change in the scale results in a finite term .",
    "as an example , starting from and adding the analogous contribution from the ` lower ' part of the central region ( where we have an analogous cutoff parameter @xmath161 ) , we can write : @xmath162 from this we see that our nlo correction does not fix the energy scale , but , for a given choice of the scale , it provides a well - defined answer .",
    "moreover , it then determines how this answer changes under a modification of the energy scale .",
    "this feature becomes more transparent if we generalize to infinite order in @xmath163 .",
    "let us consider , instead of the process @xmath164 , the scattering of two virtual photons with virtualities @xmath165 and @xmath166 , i.e.  we replace the lower quark line by another photon impact factor . in the lo approximation ,",
    "the scale of the energy factor in the total cross section is not fixed , i.e.  any change of the scale exceeds the lo accuracy .",
    "one possible choice is the symmetric scale @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 : @xmath170 this choice seems to be most natural from the point of view of the green s function . on the other hand , for a high energy scattering amplitude",
    "it is more natural to chose the ` physical ' scale @xmath171 . in nlo ,",
    "a change of the scale affects both the impact factors and the green s function , i.e.  the definition of these quantities becomes scale dependent .",
    "for example , starting from where all elements are defined with respect to the scale @xmath172 , and changing to the ` physical ' scale @xmath173 we obtain : @xmath174      & \\times      \\left(\\frac{s}{q_1q_2}\\right)^{\\omega }      \\phi_{\\gamma^ * } ( \\bm k , q_1 )      \\left(\\frac{q_1}{k}\\right)^{\\omega }      \\g_\\omega ( \\bm k , \\bm k ' )      \\phi_{\\gamma^*}(\\bm k ' , q_2 )       \\left(\\frac{q_2}{k'}\\right)^{\\omega}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it seems natural to absorb the additional factors @xmath175 and @xmath176 into the impact factors of the photon .",
    "we introduce the mellin transforms @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the eigenvalue function of the bfkl kernel ( for simplicity we ignore the scale dependence of the strong coupling @xmath163 ) .",
    "substituting these mellin transforms in the cross section formula and evaluating the integrals over @xmath179 and @xmath180 ( which lead to @xmath75-functions in the @xmath181 s ) , we obtain the following result for the cross section , @xmath182 the change of the energy scale therefore leads to shifts in the @xmath181 variables @xcite .",
    "an important consistency is the agreement with the renormalization group equation .",
    "if we consider the dis limit @xmath183 , our result has to agree with the nlo result of the dglap scheme , restricted to the neighbourhood of the point @xmath184 ( here @xmath185 is the moment index ) .",
    "it is easy to see that in the limit @xmath183 our formula can be rewritten in the following way : @xmath186 this last equation provides a stringent test for the choice of the cutoff parameter of @xmath120 .",
    "previously , in @xcite the impact factors for on - shell quarks and gluons have been considered : here the cutoff parameter has been derived from the angular ordering condition , together with the requirement that the collinear singularities are reproduced correctly .",
    "let us next address the question how our results fit into the picture of the photon wave function and the color dipole cross section .",
    "we expect that , if this picture remains valid in nlo , our results should lead to a new fock component of the photon , the @xmath85 component . for a precise definition we first have to define what we mean , in nlo , by @xmath187 component . as an example , a @xmath85 state of the photon where the gluon is either soft or collinear with the quark ( or antiquark ) , should be counted as a part of the @xmath187 component .",
    "these contributions contain the infrared singularities which cancel against those of the virtual corrections .",
    "consequently , the nlo definition of the @xmath187 component requires a ` resolution scale ' which , in the @xmath85 state of the photon , separates the @xmath187 component from the @xmath85 component .    as a first step",
    ", we consider our results  , and ignore both the infrared singularities and the subtraction of the central region discussed in the previous section .",
    "we will show that our results can be expressed in terms of a new photon wave function , @xmath188 , and the interaction cross section @xmath189 . to this end , we fourier transform into transverse configuration space .",
    "we begin with the terms proportional to @xmath190 , which are present in all @xmath74 ( except for the elements with @xmath191 ) . as an illustration ,",
    "consider the contribution @xmath192 to .",
    "obviously we can write @xmath193 ( where the sum over @xmath194 and @xmath195 is included ) . defining the fourier transform of the last factor : @xmath196 and using , , and",
    ", we note that the dependence of the integrand @xmath197 upon @xmath198 is only through the combination @xmath199 .",
    "we therefore change the integration variable @xmath179 into @xmath200 and obtain @xmath201 where @xmath202 has no dependence upon @xmath203 .",
    ".   therefore defines a new fock component of the ( longitudinal ) photon wave function .",
    "@xmath204 is the normalization constant which can be determined only in combination with the nlo @xmath5 fock - component . with a similar result for the first term in",
    ", @xmath192 takes the form : @xmath205 integrating over the transverse momenta of the @xmath85 system , we obtain @xmath75-functions in the @xmath206-vectors which allow to do the @xmath207 , @xmath208 integrals : @xmath209 where @xmath210 the final definition of @xmath211 requires an overall constant which can not be determined at this stage .",
    "the incoming and the outgoing photons have the same transverse coordinates , i.e.  the transverse coordinates of the @xmath82 system remain frozen during the interaction with the lower quark . we consider this as an important feature of the real corrections .",
    "it is easy to see that a similar analysis applies to the terms proportional to @xmath212 in all other @xmath74 . in summary",
    ", we transform the transverse momenta in the following way : @xmath213 in this way we eliminate the dependence upon @xmath203 from the fourier transforms and obtain expressions which , after insertion into , can be interpreted as photon wave function components @xmath214 .",
    "the @xmath203 dependence is entirely carried by the interaction cross sections @xmath215 , similar as in the @xmath5 case .",
    "we carry out the transformation of the elements @xmath89 in a similar fashion .",
    "the shifts in the @xmath179 and @xmath216 integrations are just transformed according to , .    as the next class of terms ,",
    "consider the terms proportional to @xmath217 .",
    "starting with @xmath218 , we proceed as before , but the fourier transformation is done only for @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively : using the same shift of momenta as before , we again find the dependence upon @xmath221 concentrated in phase factors , and the remaining integrals define new ( scalar ) contributions to the photon wave functions @xmath222 and @xmath223 which do not depend upon @xmath221 .",
    "the factor @xmath217 goes into the cross section @xmath224 .",
    "next those contributions to @xmath74 which contain @xmath101 or @xmath50 in the numerator : the first appearance is in @xmath225 , and a quick survey shows that these terms show up only if @xmath226 or @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , these pieces have to be part of the wave function component @xmath228 : e.g. @xmath229 or @xmath230 . again , the dependence upon @xmath221 can be factored out and leads to a phase factor which becomes part of the interaction cross section .",
    "finally , we have contributions proportional to @xmath231 which appear only for @xmath227 : following again the same steps as before , we take the vector @xmath90 as a part of the wave function @xmath214 , and we absorb @xmath221 into the cross section @xmath232 . the contributions proportional to scalar products such as @xmath233 are treated in a similar way : one of the two vectors belongs to the wave function @xmath234,the other into @xmath235 ( there is some freedom of how this division is done ) . in any case",
    ", the dependence upon @xmath221 can entirely be absorbed into the interaction cross sections @xmath236 .    as result ,",
    "all terms appearing on the rhs of @xmath74 , @xmath138 etc . can be cast either into the form , or @xmath237 or @xmath238 in other words , we have both scalar and vector - like contributions to the new photon wave function @xmath239 .    at this stage ,",
    "the matrix of interaction cross sections @xmath240 ( here the indices @xmath241 and @xmath242 have to be extended in order to include @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath246 , i.e.  they run from @xmath247 to @xmath248 ) is not diagonal : so far our choice of the basis of the wave function components had been dictated by the feynman diagrams from which we have started our calculations . since the matrix is symmetric , we can always find a more physical basis in which the interactions are diagonal . in this basis",
    ", our cross section can be written as a sum of squares , each of which supports the wave function interpretation .",
    "in particular , the transverse distances in the incoming and outgoing wave functions are the same : they remain ` frozen ' during the interaction with the quark target .",
    "note that the definition of eigenstates of the @xmath85-system is determined by the interaction cross section : it is the interaction with the quark which filters out the eigenstates of the @xmath85-system .",
    "as we have indicated before , this analysis is not yet complete . to proceed further",
    ", we have to combine the results of this paper with the virtual corrections obtained in @xcite : a suitable definition of the nlo @xmath187 state requires a subtraction of a part of the phase space of the @xmath85 final state . together with the subtraction of the central region",
    ", this may very well lead to a ` soft melting ' of the ` frozen ' transverse distances",
    ". this would not be totally unexpected : a soft gluon occupies a large region in transverse space , and it may take the form of a non - local cloud around the quark or antiquark .",
    "in this paper we have computed , for a longitudinally polarized virtual photon , the helicity - summed squared matrix element of the process @xmath249 .",
    "the calculation is valid in the regge limit with a large rapidity gap between the @xmath85-system and the other outgoing quark .",
    "the results are of interest for several different lines of research . in each case , further calculations are needed which will be based upon the results of this paper .",
    "first of all , our results present the real corrections to the nlo corrections of the photon impact factor . in order to complete the nlo calculations we have to integrate over the final momenta of the @xmath250-system and to combine with the virtual corrections obtained in @xcite . in the sum of the real and virtual corrections",
    "the infrared singularities have to cancel ; furthermore , we have to subtract the contribution of the central region .",
    "next , the results of this paper contain the three - parton final state of the photon - gluon fusion process @xmath251 where the incoming gluon is off - shell .",
    "the complete nlo calculation of this process also requires , in addition to the tree - level calculation of the process @xmath252 , to consider the sum with the virtual corrections to @xmath253 ( which is contained in @xcite ) . from the @xmath82 final states we have to subtract the central region . with a suitable jet definition ,",
    "one obtains the two - jet and the three - jet cross sections in the @xmath11-factorization scheme .    finally , our results are part of the nlo corrections to the photon wave function picture . ignoring infrared singularities and the problem of the central region ,",
    "we have calculated the new @xmath85 fock component of the photon wave function . however , for a proper treatment of the infrared part we need to consider also the virtual corrections in @xcite : we have to define a nlo @xmath187 fock state which includes a part of the soft gluons in our @xmath85 final state .    _",
