    "16 . with multiple ions of different propensity @xmath41 , this set of linear equations ( one for each element ) can be solved for a unique metallicity @xmath45 and a unique @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "hence , the gas metallicity probed by the background quasar at @xmath53  kpc from the galaxy is about 0.4 @xmath8 ( @xmath54 dex ) , albeit with large uncertainties dominated by the uncertainties on the h0.1emi  column density ( 0.4 dex ) .    as discussed earlier , the metallicity of the host from the nebular lines in our muse and sinfoni data is about solar ( @xmath55 ) , implying that the metallicity of the gas probed by the quasar line of sight 12 kpc away could be less enriched than that of the host , given the uncertainties .",
    "more importantly , the absorbing gas appears to be highly enriched compared to the igm metallicity of @xmath56 or less ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we now investigate the absorption line - of - sight kinematics using the least saturated low - ionization line mg0.1emi .",
    "figure  [ fig : mgi](a ) shows the low - ionization mg0.1emi  kinematic profile around the systemic velocity for the host redshift @xmath57 .",
    "the profile clearly shows a strong component at @xmath256070  km  s@xmath30 , with other weaker components at intermediate velocities , from @xmath58 to @xmath59 km  s@xmath30 .",
    "there is an additional component at @xmath60  km  s@xmath30 .",
    "as discussed in th next subsection , we can gain insights into the nature of the absorbing gas by comparing the line - of - sight kinematics ( with respect to the host galaxy kinematics ) to simple models .",
    "such analyses are powerful , but have only been possible in very few cases , such as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite with background quasars and in @xcite and @xcite with a bright background galaxy .",
    "this analysis requires good constraints on the galaxy systemic redshift and on the galaxy s relative orientation with respect to the quasar sightline .",
    "fortunately , all of these conditions are met in this study .",
    "the absorption seen in the quasar line of sight shown in figure  [ fig : mgi](a ) could arise in the following physical situations :    * it could be due to the low - ionization component of the outflow ( scenario a ) ; * it could be due to the extended parts of the ism of the host ( scenario b ) ; * it could be due to infalling cold gas cooling isotropically from a hot halo ( scenario c ) akin to high - velocity clouds ; * it could be due to infalling gas with significant angular momentum forming a `` cold - flow disks '' ( scenario d ) .",
    "an additional scenario often invoked with quasar absorption lines is the invisible satellite possibility .",
    "this scenario can never be ruled out in an individual quasar  galaxy pair , but from intervening mg0.1emii  statistics , this is the least likely possibility .",
    "indeed , the cross section of satellites is too small to account for the large @xmath61 for strong mg0.1emii  systems , as argued in @xcite .    before looking at the line - of - sight kinematics",
    ", the quasar apparent location does provide tight constraints to distinguish between the three possibilities outlined earlier .",
    "indeed , the quasar apparent position is located at an azimuthal angle of only @xmath62 from the galaxy major axis , i.e. the apparent background quasar is almost perfectly aligned with the galaxy s major axis ( figures  [ fig : musefield : narrow ] &  [ fig : vmap ] ) .",
    "the low azimuthal angle @xmath3 gives a tight constraint on the outflow scenario `` a. '' in order for the line of sight to intersect a bi - conical outflow , the outflow opening angle @xmath63 ought to be much larger than @xmath64 , i.e. be almost isotropic , given the galaxy inclination @xmath65 .",
    "this possibility is not supported by the statistical results in the literature and by our data , as discussed in section   [ section : wind ] .",
    "furthermore , a simple bi - conical flow model which has been successful in reproducing absorption profiles in @xcite would produce absorption at a single speed because the line - of - sight is almost entirely radial , and thus it would not account for the velocity range observed in the low - ionization profile shown in figure  [ fig : mgi](a ) .",
    "hence , we rule out the wind scenario `` a. ''    the low azimuthal angle @xmath3 also gives a tight constraint on the extended ism scenario `` b , '' since the projection effects are minimized along the kinematic major axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : vmap ] shows that , at the quasar location ( @xmath66r.a@xmath67138 , @xmath66decl.@xmath67084 ) , the projected line - of - sight velocity is @xmath68  km  s@xmath30 , from the modeled intrinsic ( ` deconvolved ' ) velocity field determined by our 3d fitting algorithm galpak@xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mgi](a ) shows that the maximum optical depth occurs at @xmath69  km  s@xmath30 , i.e. is consistent with the extended parts of the ism velocity field .",
    "however , the intermediate - velocity components are not accounted for under this scenario .",
    "we now investigate whether infalling cloud scenarios , with either an isotropic or anisotropic distribution , could account for the intermediate - velocity components at @xmath58 to @xmath70  km  s@xmath30  in figure  [ fig : mgi](a ) .",
    "any isotropic distribution for clouds in a galaxy halo would produce symmetric velocity distributions , which is not supported by our data .",
    "there are two additional arguments against this isotropic scenario .",
    "first , the h0.1emi  column density is too large ( @xmath71  ) compared to the typical column density in high - velocity clouds ( @xmath72  ) , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite and all have @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "second , our system has an mg0.1emii  rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath74   , whereas the typical high - velocity cloud has a rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath75 of 0.31    @xcite .",
    "lastly , it has been shown by several groups that the strong mg0.1emii  systems with @xmath76    are not virialized in their host halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the intermediate components are qualitatively similar to the features expected for anisotropic gas accretion inside halos . in particular , most numerical hydro - simulations @xcite have shown that accreting material is expected to co - rotate with the central disk in the form of a warped , extended cold gaseous `` disk '' whose absorption kinematic signatures should follow roughly the rotation direction but offset from the galaxy s systemic velocity @xcite .",
    "such rotating gaseous structures are found in the local universe with the large h0.1emi  disks present around diverse types of galaxies , e.g. around the m81 massive galaxy @xcite , the m33 low surface brightness disk @xcite , and m83 @xcite , among others .",
    "furthermore , the h0.1emi  column densities in the outer parts of these systems are well within the range of our observations .    in summary",
    ", the intermediate - velocity components of our absorption kinematic profile could be due to an extended cold gaseous `` disk '' ( sometimes referred to as cold - flow disk ) , and the largest optical depth component at @xmath77  km  s@xmath30  is likely due to the extended parts of the galaxy ism .",
    "we now turn towards a more detail modeling analysis of the line - of - sight kinematics .      in order to assess whether these qualitative signatures are in agreement with the expectations for an extended cold gaseous structure , we used a simple geometrical toy model to generate simulated absorption profiles , as in @xcite . in the model ,",
    "we distribute `` particles '' representing gas clouds in a co - planar structure ( following the host galaxy s inclination ) with predetermined kinematics .",
    "the model is composed of two components , one with circular orbits whose velocity is set by the galaxy rotation curve , and one with radial orbits , representing an accretion component . because the galaxy orientation ( galaxy inclination , p.a . )",
    "relative to the quasar is well determined from the ifu data , the only free parameter is the inflow speed at the quasar impact parameter ( @xmath53 kpc ) .    the resulting absorption profile simulated at the uves resolution is shown in figure  [ fig : mgi](a ) and agrees qualitatively with the data . the component resulting from the galaxy s rotation is shown in red , and the component from the radial inflow is shown by the blue line .",
    "we found that an inflow speed of @xmath19 100  km  s@xmath30  reproduces the profile shape , except for the component at @xmath60  km  s@xmath30 , which likely has a separate origin .",
    "we can estimate the gas column density in the intermediate - velocity components using the optical depth profile of the least depleted low - ionization element zn , or equivalently using the depletion model of @xcite on the zn , , , , and mn  column densities measured in three kinematically defined sub - regions , labeled 13 in figure  [ fig : mgi](b ) .",
    "the region `` 1 '' is defined from the components at @xmath78 km  s@xmath30 .",
    "the region `` 2 '' is defined around the components at @xmath79 km  s@xmath30 , and region `` 3 '' is defined with @xmath80 km  s@xmath30  corresponding to the galaxy rotation .",
    "figure  [ fig : mgi](b ) shows that the depletion factor @xmath42 and total gas plus metal column density @xmath47 are different in the three subregions .",
    "the top panel shows that the depletion level seems the lowest in the accretion region ( zone 2 ) , consistent with this gas being the least processed .",
    "the bottom panel shows that , provided that the metallicity does not vary across the profile significantly , about 70%  of the total column density ( 19.90 of the total 20.05 in @xmath47 ) is carried by the middle zone `` 2 , '' corresponding to the accretion zone . with a metallicity of -0.4 dex ,",

    "the analysis of the quasar absorption profile obtained with the vlt / uves spectrograph shows    * distinct signatures of co - planar gas that appears to be co - rotating with the host galaxy , but at a speed lower than the rotation velocity ( figure  [ fig : mgi]a ) from the low - ionization metal absorption lines ; * that the metallicity of the absorbing gas is estimated at about @xmath9 ( 0.4 @xmath8 ; figures  [ fig : uves ] and [ fig : jenkins ] ) globally across the profile  b ) , but not the absolute metallicity . ] , which is much larger than the igm metallicity of @xmath153 for fresh infalls , implying a significant amount of recycling .",
    "we discussed various interpretations of these absorption signatures ( in   [ section : interpretation ] ) and argued that the most likely interpretation is one that is analogous to large h0.1emi  gas disks seen in the local universe , which can extend 23 times larger than the half - light radius .",
    "in numerical simulations , such structures can appear at significant look - back times and are sometimes referred to as `` cold - flow disks '' @xcite . in this context , we estimated that the amount of infalling / accreting material is @xmath154  ( eq .  [ eq : accr ] ) , i.e. about two times larger than the sfr . by comparing the estimate of the gas accretion rate and the expected gas inflow rate for a halo of @xmath155  , we find that the accretion efficiency @xmath105 is @xmath156 for wind loading factors @xmath117 . finally , we find that the angular momentum of the co - planar structure is at least 50%  larger than that of the galaxy given the minimum extent of this structure .",
    "similar cases appeared recently in the literature .",
    "there is our work @xcite , which showed observational signatures similar to ones presented here in a @xmath157 galaxy , and there are the recent ifu observations of a giant ly0.1em@xmath3  emitting filament by @xcite around a high - redshift quasar @xcite which provide possible evidence for kinematics compatible with a larger ( 220 kpc in radius ) gaseous rotating disk .",
    "the similarity between the kinematics of these gaseous structures and those of some hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and the evidences provided in the current study suggest that these structures may not be uncommon in the high - redshift universe .",
