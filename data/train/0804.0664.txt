    "massive star - formation processes are poorly understood phenomena due to large distances , high extinction , and substantial source confusion .",
    "recent infrared observations of ( sub)arcsecond high - resolution allow one to study the complex nature of ob star - formations .",
    "in particular , near - infrared ( nir ) imaging linear polarimetry is a powerful tool for investigating the circumstellar structures of the young stellar objects ( ysos ) . the radiation from ysos still embedded in their parent molecular clouds is often scattered by the dust in their circumstellar structures , and is observed as infrared reflection nebula ( irn ) .",
    "this is also a good morphological tracer of mass outflow @xcite , especially observed at high resolution @xcite . in massive star - formation regions ,",
    "nir polarimetry can distinguish the irne from the region nebulae @xcite , which allows one to easily uncover new irne buried in various emissions .",
    "in this letter , we present wide - field linear polarization of the ngc 6334 region .",
    "ngc 6334 is an active massive star - formation complex , a total bolometric luminosity @xmath4 @xcite , at a distance of 1.7 kpc @xcite .",
    "this giant ( @xmath310 pc ) complex has several separated massive star - formation sites .",
    "@xcite show six strong far - infrared ( fir ) sources named ngc 6334 i to vi ( see @xcite for more details on other observations ) .",
    "since each site is in the same parent cloud at the same distance , systematic studies of massive star - fomation and its evolution are expected to be conducted .",
    "the nir linear polarization images were obtained on june 25 , 30 , and july 1 2006 with the sirius camera , simultaneous three - color infrared imager for unbiased survey @xcite and its polarimeter ( sirpol ; kandori et al . 2006 ) mounted on the irsf 1.4 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory in sutherland .",
    "the image scale of the array was 0@xmath545 pixel@xmath6 , giving a field of view of @xmath7 .",
    "the polarizations were measured by stepping the half waveplate to four angular positions ( 0 , 45 , 22.5and 67.5 ) .",
    "ten dithered frames were observed per waveplate position , and we observed 9 sets for the object , giving @xmath8 frames of 10 s integration per waveplate position .",
    "seeing was 1@xmath55 ( fwhm ) in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard manner of infrared image reduction : subtracting a dark - frame and dividing by a flat - frame .",
    "in addition , the data for each waveplate position were registered , and then combined .",
    "the stokes parameters were derived in the same manner as @xcite .",
    "the intensity images and linear polarization vector images in the nir bands are shown in figs.[fig1](a ) to ( e ) .",
    "we briefly explain the detected irne in  [ 3.1 ] , which are selected from the highly polarized intensity and the polarization vector pattern , and then qualitatively discuss their polarization properties in  [ 3.2 ] .      _ ngc 6334 i. _  we identify five irne as shown in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "irn i-1 is illuminated by the ultracompact ( uc ) region of ngc 6334 f @xcite .",
    "irn i-2 and 3 are not illuminated by ngc 6334 f @xcite but are a monopolar and a bipolar nebula illuminated by dpt00 2 @xcite and kdj i-3 @xcite , respectively .",
    "irn i-4 is also a bipolar nebula associated with an invisible nir source .",
    "irn i-5 around irs i-14 @xcite has a concentric polarization .    _",
    "ngc 6334 ii . _",
    " fig.[fig1](b ) shows an approximately centrosymmetric polarized pattern .",
    "though we calculate the position of the illuminating source from the intersection of the normals to the polarization vectors , marked with a 1@xmath9 error circle in fig.[fig1](b ) , there are no bright sources within the error circle .",
    "note that irs ii-22 @xcite near the error circle is surrounded by a local concentric polarization .",
    "the edge of the spherical region has a higher ( @xmath35 % ) polarization than the vicinity of the error circle ( @xmath31 % ) .",
    "we refer to this region as irn ii-1 .",
    "fig.[fig1](b ) also shows that an elongated irn ii-2 , clearly seen in a polarized intensity image , has a polarization relatively well aligned with @xmath10 .    _",
    "ngc 6334 iii . _",
    " similar to irn ii-1 , fig.[fig1](c ) shows a centrosymmetric polarized pattern on the edge of the region and the polarization is higher on the edge . since irs",
    "@xcite is the brightest nir source near the error circle , we believe it is the illuminating source .",
    "we refer to this region as irn iii-1 .",
    "another irn is a relatively large bipolar nebula of irn iii-2 associated with a totally invisible source at nir wavelengths .    _",
    "ngc 6334 iv .",
    "_  fig.[fig1](d ) shows irn iv-1 , similar to irn ii-1 and iii-1 , has a centrosymmetric polarized pattern , and the positional error circle indicates that irs iv-54 @xcite is the illuminating source .",
    "irn iv-2 and 3 , better seen in a polarized intensity image , have relatively well aligned polarizations , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "there is irn iv-4 with a concentric polarization around irs iv-10 @xcite .",
    "irn iv-5 is a bipolar nebula associated with an invisible source at nir wavelengths .",
    "the faint irn iv-6 is associated with an optically thin region , g351.24 + 0.65 @xcite .    _",
    "ngc 6334 v. _  in spite of a bipolar morphology for irn v-1 and 2 in fig.[fig1](e ) , @xcite showed their illuminating sources are different ( see also chrysostomou et al .",
    "irn v-3 is associated with a monopolar nebula with irs v-41 @xcite .",
    "eighteen irne are detected in ngc 6334 , and these irne can be divided into four categories of type a to d. we conclude their illuminating sources are embedded or visible ob stars from the previous radio and infrared observations , except irn i-4 , ii-1 , 2 , iii-2 , iv-3 , and 5 without the previous radio and infrared observations ( see table [ table1 ] caption ) .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes the list of eighteen irne and the nature of their illuminating sources .",
    "the first category ( _ type a _ ) contains irne with relatively well aligned polarization vectors .",
    "these irne have a non - point - like morphology and extend in a direction relatively perpendicular to polarization vectors .",
    "the illuminating sources are invisible at nir wavelengths . the second category ( _ type b _ ) contains monopolar / bipolar irne with several ten percent level polarization .",
    "the illuminating sources are invisible at nir wavelengths . the third category ( _ type c _ ) contains irne with concentric polarization around the visible illuminating sources at nir wavelengths .",
    "these irne have a relatively small scale ( @xmath130.1 pc ) .",
    "the last category ( _ type d _ ) contains relatively large scale irne ( @xmath141 pc ) .",
    "the edge of irne has centrosymmetric polarization and have a higher polarization than the vicinity of the illuminating source .",
    "the reason we conclude type a is the youngest is that the density of circumstellar material seems to be the highest . in this case ,",
    "in contrast to the case of type b described below , we expect that originally centrosymmetric polarization in the envelope region can be affected by multiple scattering , resulting in aligned vector patterns as observed ( see e.g. , fischer et al .",
    "@xcite in fact detected a similar aligned polarization in irn associated with l1527 in taurus .",
    "this irn extends in the direction of the outflow @xcite , perpendicular to polarization vectors .",
    "@xcite recently found a compact redshifted outflow , whose extension is well correlated with irn ii-2 .",
    "we also suggest that the illuminating source of irn ii-2 might be invisible at nir wavelengths , and is therefore not likely to be irs ii-23 or 24 .",
    "similarly , the extensions of irn iv-2 and 3 are relatively perpendicular to polarization vectors in each of the nebulae .",
    "additionally , these irne are located in the vicinity of the submillimeter sources detected by @xcite .",
    "thus we also categorize them as type a.    the more evolved type b contains eight irne which are monopolar / bipolar nebulae . since a close relationship has been suggested between irne and co outflows ( nagata et al . 1984 ; hodapp et al .",
    "1984 ; sato et al . 1985 ; yamashita et al . 1989 ) , we consider these irne correspond to the walls of the outflow material where the vectors are nearly centrosymmetric",
    ". recently @xcite summarized the relation between the outflow collimation and its evolution ; irn iii-2 is categorized as the most evolved one in their classification .",
    "small scale type c contains irn i-5 and iv-4 associated with the visible nir sources .",
    "the transition from type b to c we infer is as follows : the outflow associated with the type b sources widens its opening angle with its evolution @xcite , then stellar radiation might be scattered by circumstellar material more concentric rather than bipolar / monopolar .",
    "note that since it is possible that the concentric polarization is due to the inclination of outflow , these irne could be categorized as type b.    finally , type d contains relatively large irne .",
    "the illuminating sources have well - developed regions that have had time to expand into the surrounding cloud . due to stronger ionized gas emission in the vicinity of the illuminating sources ,",
    "the degree of polarization is lower near the source than at the edge of the region .",
    "these irne could be due to reflection from dust at the ionization front .    in orion , irne around irc2 and",
    "bn correspond to type b , and that around the trapezium region is inferred to be type d. in particular , that of bn is similar to irn v-3 since the monopolar irn is associated with the nir visible illuminating source .",
    "to summarize , we detected eighteen irne associated with young ob stars and suggest that the difference of the polarized patterns reflects the evolutionary sequence of irne ; the youngest irne with well aligned polarization ( _ type a _ ) evolve into monopolar / bipolar irne with roughly centrosymmetric polarization ( _ type b _ ) .",
    "when irne have concentric polarizations ( _ type c _ ) , the illuminating sources create regions , and then , irne become less distinct near the central sources with a centrosymmetric circular pattern at the region of the ionization boundary ( _ type d _ ) .",
    "we note , however , that care must be taken to infer above conclusions from the polarization pattern alone .",
    "further high resolution radio observations for kinematical information should be undertaken to verify our irn evolutionary hypothesis .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for providing many useful comments leading to an improved paper .",
