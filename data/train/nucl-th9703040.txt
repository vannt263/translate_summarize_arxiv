    "with the development of various heavy - ion facilities , nuclear physics is expanding into many new directions .",
    "one of these is the study of the properties of strange particles , namely hyperons and kaons , in dense matter .",
    "strangeness plays a special role in the development of hadronic and nuclear models .",
    "the mass of strange quark is about 150 mev , which is , on the one hand , considerably larger than the mass of light ( up and down ) quarks ( @xmath3 mev ) , but on the other hand , much smaller than that of charm quark ( @xmath4 gev ) . in the limit of vanishing quark mass",
    "the chiral symmetry is good , and systematic studies can be carried out using chiral perturbation theory for hadrons made of light quarks . on the other hand ,",
    "if the quark mass is large , one can use the non - relativistic quark model to study the properties of charmed and heavier hadrons . the hadrons with strangeness lie in between these two limits and therefore present a challenge to the theorists .    nevertheless , chiral perturbation calculations have been extensively and quite successfully carried out in the recent past for the study of kaon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) and antikaon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) scattering @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the success of the chiral perturbation theory is the existence of a large body of experimental data that can used to constrain the various parameters in the chiral lagrangian .    of great interest to nuclear physicists is the study of the properties of strange hadrons in dense matter .",
    "chiral perturbation calculations in matter are still under development , since a new energy scale , the fermi momentum , is now involved . for this kind of theoretical development to be successful ,",
    "a large body of experimental data that can be obtained only from heavy - ion collisions are needed .",
    "the study of kaon properties in dense matter is also relevant for astrophysics problems , such as the properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "there have been some studies on strangeness production and flow in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we will concentrate on recent development concerning strangeness production in ni+ni collisions at 1 - 2 agev .",
    "we will show that these observables are sensitive to kaon properties in dense matter and can thus provide useful information for the development of chiral perturbation theory in matter and for the study of neutron star properties . in section",
    "ii , we review briefly the current understanding of kaon properties in nuclear matter , the relativistic transport model with strangeness , and the various elementary processes for strangeness production . our results for strangeness spectra and flow will be reported in section iii , where we will also compare our results for proton and pion spectra to experimental data .",
    "finally a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "our study is based on the relativistic transport model extended to include the strange degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian we use is given by @xmath7 in the above the first line gives the usual non - linear @xmath8-@xmath9 model with the self - interaction of the scalar field .",
    "the second line is for the hyperons which couple to the scalar and vector fields with 2/3 of the nucleon strength , as in the constituent quark model .",
    "the last line is for the kaon which is derived from the su(3 ) chiral lagrangian .",
    "note that since the hyperon and kaon densities in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies are very small , their contributions to the scalar and vector fields are neglected .    from this lagrangian",
    "we get the kaon and antikaon in - medium energies @xmath10^{1/2 } + b_k \\rho_n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath11^{1/2 } - b_k \\rho_n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 gev@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two parameters that determine the strength of attractive scalar potential for kaon and antikaon , respectively . if one considers only the kaplan - nelson term , then @xmath16 . in the same order",
    ", there is also the range term which acts differently on kaon and antikaon , and leads to different scalar attractions .",
    "we take the point of view that they can be treated as free parameters and try to constrain them from the experimental observables in heavy - ion collisions .    in chiral perturbation theory , in the same order as the kaplan - nelson term",
    "there is the range term , which can be taken into account by renormalizing @xcite @xmath17 since @xmath18 for the densitis considered here , there is a reduction of @xmath19 from the range term .",
    "however , @xmath20 is also density dependent @xcite , @xmath21 we do not know quantitatively the behaviour of @xmath22 at higher densities , although we would expect it to continue to decrease with density .",
    "we see that , at least in the range of densities @xmath23 , there is considerable cancellation between effects of the range term and the decrease in @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore neglect both for @xmath0 .    in the case of @xmath1 meson",
    ", the range term drops rapidly with density as @xmath24 decreases .",
    "we thus neglect the range term and relate @xmath15 to @xmath14 , namely , @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath26 in @xmath27 is not scaled with density .",
    "the @xmath27 represents the vector interaction , which is 1/3 of the vector mean field acting on a nucleon . in our recent paper @xcite",
    ", it is shown that for @xmath28 , the region of densities important for kaon and antikaon production and flow , the nucleon vector mean field is estimated to be only about 15% larger than @xmath29 .",
    "the increase from scaling @xmath30 is evidently largely canceled by the decrease from short - range correlations .",
    "our parameterization thus incorporates roughly what we know about the scaling of @xmath20 and of effects from short - range interactions .",
    "using @xmath31 gev@xmath32@xmath13 and @xmath33 gev@xmath32@xmath13 , the kaon and antikaon effective mass , defined as their energies at zero momentum , are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the kaon mass increases slightly with density , resulting from near cancellation of the attractive scalar and repulsive vector potential . the mass of antikaon drops substantially . at normal nuclear matter density",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 , the kaon mass increases about 4% , in rough agreement with the prediction of impulse approximation based on @xmath5 scattering length .",
    "the antikaon mass drops by about 22% , which is somewhat smaller than what has been inferred from the kaonic atom data @xcite , namely , an attractive @xmath1 potential of @xmath36 mev at @xmath37 .    from fig .",
    "1 we find that @xmath38 mev .",
    "the correction for neutron rich matetr in using @xmath39 in neutron stars is about 50 mev upwards , giving @xmath40 mev @xcite . with the electron chemical potential of @xmath41 mev @xcite ,",
    "this implies that kaon condensation will take place at dnsity @xmath23 .    from the lagrangian we can also derive equations of motion for nucleons @xcite @xmath42 for hyperons @xmath43 and for kaons @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being nucleon scalar and vector potentials .",
    "the minus and the plus sign in the last equation correspond to kaon and antikaon , respectively .",
    "in addition to propagations in their mean field potentials , we include typical two - body scattering processes such as @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "kaons and hyperons are mainly produced from the following baryon - baryon and pion - nucleon collisions , namely @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the cross section for the former is taken to be the randrup - ko parameterization @xcite , and the cross section for the latter is taken from cugnon _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "the antikaon production cross section in baryon - baryon collisions is taken from the recent work of sibirtsev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , while that in pion - nucleon collisions is fitted to experimental data .",
    "antikaons can also be produced from hyperon - pion collisons through the strangeness exchange process , namely , @xmath54 .",
    "the cross section for this process is obtained from the reverse one , @xmath55 , by the detailed - balance relation .",
    "the latter cross section , together with the @xmath6 elastic and absorption cross sections , are parameterized based on the available experimental data .",
    "we note that the antikaon absorption cross section is relatively large , and increases significantly with descreasing antikaon momentum , while kaons and hyperons undergo mainly elastic scattering with nucleons .",
    "we have studied strangeness production and flow mainly for ni+ni collisions at 1 - 2 gev / nucleon .",
    "our results for proton and pion transverse mass spectra in central ni+ni collisions at 1.06 agev are shown in fig .",
    "2 . we determine our centrality to be @xmath56 fm in order to compare with the fopi data @xcite which correspond to a geometric cross section of 100 mb . to get free protons we applied a density cut of @xmath57 .",
    "it is seen that our model describes both the proton and pion spectra very well .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "3 we show our results for @xmath0 kinetic energy spectra in ni+ni collisions at 1.0 agev , with impact parameter @xmath58 fm . the solid histogram gives the results with kaon medium effects , while the dotted histogram is the results without kaon medium effects .",
    "the open circles are the experimental data from the kaos collaboration @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the results with kaon medium effects are in good agreement with the data , while those without kaon medium effects slightly overestimate the data .",
    "we note that kaon feels a slightly repulsive potential , thus the inclusion of the kaon medium effects reduces the kaon yield .",
    "the slopes of the kaon spectra in the two cases also differ . with a repulsive potential ,",
    "kaons are accelerated during the propagation , leading to a larger slope parameter as compared to the case without kaon medium effects .",
    "the results for @xmath1 kinetic energy spectra in ni+ni collisions at 1.8 agev are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the solid and dotted histograms are the results with and without kaon medium effects .",
    "it is seen that without medium effects , our results are about a factor 3 - 4 below the experimental data . with the inclusion of the medium effects which reduces the antikaon production threshold ,",
    "@xmath1 yield increases by about a factor of 3 and our results are in good agreement with the data .",
    "this is similar to the findings of cassing _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the kaos data show that the @xmath1 yield at 1.8 agev agrees roughly with the @xmath0 yield at 1.0 agev .",
    "this is a nontrial observation . at these energies ,",
    "the q - values for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are both -230 mev . near their thresholds , the cross section for the @xmath1 production is about one order of magnitude smaller than that for @xmath0 production .",
    "in addition , antikaons are strongly absorbed in heavy - ion collisions , which should further reduces the @xmath1 yield .",
    "the kaos results of @xmath61 indicate thus the importance of secondary processes such as @xmath62 @xcite , and medium effects which acts oppositely on the kaon and antikaon production in medium .",
    "in addition to particle yield , the collective flow of particles provide complimentary information about hadron properties in dense matter . in the left panel of fig .",
    "4 we compare our results for proton flow in ni+ni collisions at 1.93 agev with the experimental data from the fopi collaboration @xcite .",
    "note that both the data and our results include a transverse momentum cut of @xmath63 .",
    "the agreement with the data is very good .",
    "the @xmath2 flow in the same system is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the flow of the primodial @xmath2 s , as shown in the figure by short - dashed curve , is considerably smaller than that of protons shown by dotted curve .",
    "inclusions of @xmath64 rescattering ( long - dashed curve ) and propagation in potential ( solid curve ) increase the @xmath2 flow in the direction of proton flow .",
    "both the fopi @xcite and the eos @xcite collaborations found that the @xmath2 flow is very similar to that of protons .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "5 we show our results for @xmath0 flow in ni+ni collisions at 1.93 agev , based on three scenarios for kaon potentials in nuclear medium . without potential , kaons flow in the direction of nucleon as shown by the dotted curve . without scalar potential , kaons feel a strong repulsive potential , and they flow in the opposite direction to nucleons as shown by the dashed curve . with both the scalar and vector potentials",
    ", kaons feel a weak repulsive potential , and one sees the disappearance of kaon flow , which is in good agreement with the experimental data from the fopi collaboration @xcite . in the right panel of fig .",
    "5 we show @xmath1 flow in ni+ni collsions at 1.93 agev and @xmath65 fm . without medium effects",
    "one sees a clear antikaon antiflow signal , because of strong absorption of @xmath1 by nucleons . including the attractive antikaon potential , those antikaons that survive the absorption",
    "are pulled towards nucleon and thus show a weak antikaon flow signal .",
    "the experimental measurement of @xmath1 in heavy - ion collisions will be very helpful in determining @xmath1 properties in nuclear matter .",
    "in summary , we studied strangeness ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) production and flow in ni+ni collisions at 1 - 2 agev .",
    "we based our study on the relativistic transport model including the strangeness degrees of freedom .",
    "we found that strangeness spectra and flow are sensitive to the properties of strange hadrons in nuclear medium .",
    "the predictions of the chiral perturbation theory that the @xmath0 feels a weak repulsive potential and @xmath1 feels a strong attractive potential are in good agreement with recent experimental data from fopi and kaos collaborations .",
