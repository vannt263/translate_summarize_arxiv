    "problem ( [ defpb ] ) is a _",
    "fractional programming _ problem of a rather general form .",
    "nevertheless , we assume that the degree of each @xmath10 and @xmath11 is relatively small ( up to 10 ) , but the number of terms @xmath12 can be quite large ( 10 to 100 ) . for dense data the number of variables @xmath13 should also be small ( up to 10 )",
    ". however , this number can be also quite large ( 10 to 100 ) provided that the problem data feature some kind of sparsity ( to be specified later ) . even though problem ( [ defpb ] ) is of self - interest , our initial motivation came from some applications in computer vision , where such problems are typical .",
    "these applications will be described elsewhere .    in such a situation , fractional programming problem ( [ defpb ] )",
    "is quite challenging .",
    "indeed , we make _ no _ assumption on the polynomials @xmath14 whereas even with a relatively small number of fractions and under convexity ( resp .",
    "concavity ) assumptions on @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) , problem ( [ defpb ] ) is hard to solve ( especially if one wants to compute the global minimum ) ; see for example the survey @xcite and references therein .",
    "we are interested in solving problem ( [ defpb ] ) globally , in the sense that we do not content ourselves with a local optimum satisfying first order optimality conditions , as typically obtained with standard local optimization algorithms such as newton s method or its variants .",
    "if problem ( [ defpb ] ) is too difficult to solve globally ( because of ill - conditioning and/or too large a number of variables or terms in the objective function ) , we would like to have at least a valid lower bound on the global minimum , since upper bounds can be obtained with local optimization algorithms .",
    "one possible approach is to reduce all fractions @xmath17 to same denominator and obtain a single rational fraction to minimize",
    ". then one may try to apply the hierarchy of semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxations defined in @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.8 ) .",
    "but such a strategy is not appropriate because the degree of the common denominator is potentially large and even if @xmath13 is small , one may not even implement the first relaxation of the hierarchy , due to the present limitations of sdp solvers .",
    "moreover , in general this strategy also destroys potential sparsity patterns present in the original formulation ( [ defpb ] ) , and so precludes from using an appropriate version ( for the rational fraction case ) of the sparse semidefinite relaxations introduced in @xcite whose convergence was proved in @xcite under some conditions on the sparsity pattern , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 4.6 and 5.3.4 ) .",
    "another possibility is to introduce additional variables @xmath18 ( that we may call liftings ) with associated constraints @xmath19 and solve the equivalent problem : @xmath20 which is now a _ polynomial _",
    "optimization problem in the new variables @xmath21 , and where the new feasible set @xmath22 is modeling the epigraphs of the rational terms .",
    "the sparsity pattern is preserved and if @xmath8 is compact one may in general obtain upper and lower bounds @xmath23 on the @xmath18 so as to make @xmath24 compact by adding the quadratic ( redundant ) constraints @xmath25 , @xmath9 , and apply the sparse semidefinite relaxations . however , in doing so one introduces @xmath12 additional variables , and this may have an impact on the overall performance , especially if @xmath12 is large . in the sequel",
    "this approach is referred to as the _ epigraph approach_.    the goal of the present paper is to circumvent all above difficulties in the following two situations : either @xmath13 is relatively small , or @xmath13 is potentially large but some sparsity is present , i.e. , each @xmath10 and each @xmath11 in ( [ defpb ] ) is concerned with only a small subset of variables . in the approach that we propose , we do not need the epigraph liftings .",
    "the idea is to formulate ( [ defpb ] ) as an equivalent infinite - dimensional linear problem which a particular instance of the generalized moment problem ( gmp ) as defined in @xcite , with @xmath12 unknown measures ( where each measure is associated with a fraction @xmath17 ) . in turn",
    "this problem can be easily modeled and solved with our public - domain software gloptipoly 3 @xcite , a significant update of gloptipoly 2 @xcite . in the sequel",
    "this approach is referred to as the _ gmp approach_.    the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ dense ]",
    "we introduce the sdp relaxations first in the case that @xmath13 is small and the data are dense polynomials . then in section [ sparse ] we extend the sdp relaxations to the case that @xmath13 is large but sparsity is present . in section [ gmp ]",
    "we show how the gmp formulation can be exploited to model the sdp relaxations of problem ( [ defpb ] ) easily with gloptipoly 3 .",
    "we also provide a collection of numerical experiments showing the relevance of our gmp approach , especially in comparison with the epigraph approach .",

    "if we use a standard quasi - newton bfgs algorithm , we obtain after a few iterations a point matching the known global minimizer to eight significant digits .    in the case",
    "@xmath244 , for which the global minimum is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 17 ) , the gmp approach yields a certificate of global optimality at order @xmath245 in about 750 seconds of cpu time . here",
    "too , we observe that the extracted minimizer @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 , @xmath255 is a good approximation to the minimizer , with four correct significant digits . if necessary",
    ", this point can be used as an initial guess for refining with a local solver .",
    "note that it is not possible to exploit problem sparsity in this case , since all the variables appear in each term in sum ( [ shekel ] ) .",
    "consider the rational optimization problem @xmath256 which has the same critical points as the well - known rosenbrock problem @xmath257 whose geometry is troublesome for local optimization solvers .",
    "it can been easily shown that the global maximum @xmath258 of problem ( [ rosenbrock ] ) is achieved at @xmath259 , @xmath260 .",
    "our experiments with local optimization algorithms reveal that standard quasi - newton solvers or functions of the optimization toolbox for matlab , called repeatedly with random initial guesses , typically yield local maxima quite far from the global maximum .    with our gmp approach , after exploiting sparsity and adding bound constraints @xmath261 , @xmath260",
    ", we could solve problem ( [ rosenbrock ] ) with a certificate of global optimality for @xmath13 up to @xmath262 .",
    "typical cpu times range from 10 seconds for @xmath263 to 500 seconds for @xmath264 .",
    "the problem of minimizing the sum of _ many _ low - degree ( typically non - convex ) rational fractions on a ( typically non - convex ) semi - algebraic set arises in several important applications , and notably in computer vision ( triangulation , estimation of the fundamental matrix in epipolar geometry ) and in systems control ( @xmath265 optimal control with a fixed - order controller of a linear system subject to parametric uncertainty ) .",
    "these engineering problems motivated our work , but the application of our techniques to computer vision and systems control will be described elsewhere .",
    "these fractional programming problems being non convex , local optimization approaches yield only upper bounds on the optimum .    in this paper",
    "we were interested in computing the global minimum ( and possibly global minimizers ) or at least , computing valid lower bounds on the global minimum , for fractional programs involving a sum with many terms .",
    "we have used a semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxation approach by formulating the rational optimization problem as an instance of the generalized moment problem ( gmp ) . in addition",
    ", problem structure can be sometimes exploited in the case where the number of variables is large but sparsity is present .",
    "numerical experiments with our public - domain software gloptipoly interfaced with off - the - shelf semidefinite programming solvers indicate that the approach can solve problems that can be challenging for state - of - the - art global optimization algorithms .",
    "this is consistent with the experiments made in @xcite where the ( dense ) sdp relaxation approach was first applied to ( polynomial ) optimization problems of computer vision .    for larger and/or ill - conditioned problems",
    ", it can happen that gloptipoly extracts from the moment matrix a minimizer which is not very accurate .",
    "it can also happen that gloptipoly is not able to extract a minimizer , in which case first - order moments approximate the minimizer ( provided it is unique , which is generically true for rational optimization ) .",
    "the approximate minimizer can be then input to any local optimization algorithm as an initial guess .",
    "a comparison of our approach with other techniques of global optimization ( reported e.g. on hans mittelmann s or arnold neumaier s webpages ) is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "we believe however that such a comparison would be fair only if no expert tuning is required for alternative algorithms . indeed , when using gloptipoly the only assumption we make is that we know a ball containing the global optimizer . besides this , our results are fully reproducible ( matlab files reproducing our examples are available upon request ) and our sdp relaxations are solved with general - purpose semidefinite programming solvers .",
    "we are grateful to michel devy , jean - jos orteu , tom pajdla , thierry sentenac and rekha thomas for insightful discussions on applications of real algebraic geometry and sdp in computer vision , and to josh taylor for his feedback on the example of section [ sparse_ex ] .",
