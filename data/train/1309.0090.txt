    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are believed to be powered by accretion onto super - massive black holes , which are strong sources emitting from radio to x - rays .",
    "the luminous agns , mainly including radio quiet quasars and bright seyfert galaxies , are believed to be powered dominantly by a geometrically thin , optically thick , accretion disk extending down to the innermost stable circular orbits ( isco ) of a black hole ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; shields 1978 ; malkan & sargent 1982 ; kishimoto , antouncci & blaes 2005 ; shang et al . 2005 ; liu et al .",
    "observations show that accretion flows in low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) are very different .",
    "a two - component structure of the accretion flow with an inner hot , optically thin , advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , an outer cool , optically thick truncated accretion disk , and a jet are supported by a number of observational evidence for llagns ( ho 2008 and the references therein ) . the observational evidence for such a structure in llagns comes mainly from the broadband emission from the radio to x - rays ( lasota et al . 1996 ; quataert et al .",
    "1999 ; di matteo et al.2000 , 2003 ; yuan et al . 2009 ; li et al .",
    "for example , by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc 1097 , nemmen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that the optical and x - ray portion of the sed can be well fitted by an inner adaf and an outer accretion disk truncated at @xmath10 schwarzschild radii , and the observed radio emission can be very well interpreted by the synchrotron emission of a relativistic jet modeled within the framework of the internal shock scenario ( yuan et al .",
    "the presence of a jet in llagns has been clearly detected by the vlbi radio observations ( falcke et al .",
    "2000 ; nagar et al .",
    "2001 ) . meanwhile , theoretically , because of the positive bernoulli parameter of the hot adaf , it is probably that the formation of the bipolar jets are driven by the adaf ( narayan & yi 1995b ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; meier et al .",
    "2001 ; yuan et al .",
    "2012a , b ) .",
    "the evidence for the presence of an inner adaf in llagns is inferred from the very low luminosity and the very lower radiative efficiency estimated from the available mass supply rate ( ho 2009 ) . in terms of eddington luminosity , llagns often have @xmath11 contrary to the luminous agns with @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) ( panessa et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the observed anti - correlation between the hard x - ray index @xmath15 and @xmath16 implies that llagns may be dominated by adaf ( gu & cao 2009 ; younes et al . 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "xu ( 2011 ) collected a llagn sample composed of 49 sources including 28 local seyfert galaxies and 21 low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) with optical / uv and x - ray observations .",
    "it is found that there is a strong anti - correlation between @xmath17 and eddington ratio @xmath16 for the sources with @xmath18 , which supports that adaf model is a very promising candidate in llagns .",
    "the evidence for the truncation of the accretion disk in llagns is inferred from the lack of a ` big blue bump ' , instead of a ` big red bump ' ( nemmen et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the very weak or absent broad iron @xmath19 line , which is attributed to x - ray fluorescence off of an optically thick accretion disk extending down to a few schwarzschild radii of luminous agns , also supports that the accretion disk truncates at a larger radius ( @xmath20 schwarzschild radii ) off the black hole in llagns ( nandra et al .",
    "quataert et al .",
    "( 1999 ) fitted the optical / uv spectrum of m81 with a mass accretion rate of @xmath21 eddington accretion rate and an accretion disk truncated at @xmath22 schwarzschild radii .",
    "a similar fit to the optical / uv spectrum of ngc 4579 yielded a higher mass accretion rate of @xmath23 eddington accretion rate , while the truncation radius of the accretion disk is still @xmath22 schwarzschild radii ( quataert et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the relationship between the truncation radius and the mass accretion rate is still controversial . by fitting the seds of a population of llagns , yuan & narayan ( 2004 )",
    "found that the lower eddington ratio @xmath24 was associated with a larger truncation radius . by studying 33 pg quasars with fe @xmath25 emission line detected by the _ xmm - newton _ survey , inoue",
    ", terashima & ho ( 2007 ) found that the fe @xmath25 line systematically becomes narrow with decreasing @xmath26 , which probably means that the truncation radius of the accretion disk increases with decreasing mass accretion rate .",
    "it is interesting that the inverse correlation between the truncation radius of the accretion disk and the mass accretion rate is also found in the low / hard spectral state of black hole x - ray binaries ( cabanac et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism for determining the truncation of the accretion disk has been proposed by many authors ( honma 1996 ; manmoto & kato 2000 ; lu et al .",

    "the spectral features of an inner adaf and an outer truncated accretion disk predicted by the disk evaporation model in stellar - mass black holes were investigated by qiao & liu ( 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "the first application of disk evaporation model to interpret the truncation of the accretion disk in llagns was from liu et al .",

    "( 2012 ) generalized the disk evaporation model in black hole x - ray binaries by including the effect of a magnetic field in accretion disk to apply the model to the truncation of the accretion disk in a large number of llagns .",
    "it is found that the truncation radius of the accretion disk can be very strongly affected by the magnetic parameters @xmath27 , which is defined as @xmath28 , ( where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is gas pressure and @xmath31 is magnetic pressure ) , describing the strength of the magnetic field in the accretion flows .",
    "taam et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the inclusion of magnetic field results in a smaller truncation radius compared to the case without magnetic field .    in this work , based on the prediction by taam et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for the truncation of the accretion disk , the emergent spectrum of a two - component structure with an inner adaf and an outer truncated accretion disk around a supermassive black hole is calculated .",

    "( 2012 ) , the truncation radius of the accretion disk is very sensitive to @xmath27 , which consequently affects the emergent spectrum .",
    "our calculations show that the equipartition of gas pressure to magnetic pressure , i.e. , @xmath1 , failed to explain the observed anti - correlation between @xmath6 and the bolometric correction @xmath7 ( with @xmath33 ) .",
    "the emergent spectra for larger value @xmath0 or @xmath9 can well explain the observed @xmath34-@xmath7 correlation . it is argued that the sub - equipartition of the magnetic field is reasonable in the case with a low mass accretion . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly introduce the disk evaporation model .",
    "the emergent spectra of disk evaporation model are presented in section 3 .",
    "some applications of the disk evaporation model to llagns are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is the conclusion .",
    "we consider a hot corona above a geometrically thin standard disk around a central black hole . in the corona",
    ", viscous dissipation leads to ion heating , which is partially transferred to the electrons by means of coulomb collisions .",
    "this energy is then conducted down into lower , cooler , and denser corona .",
    "if the density in this layer is sufficiently high , the conductive flux is radiated away .",
    "if the density is too low to efficiently radiate energy , cool matter is heated up and evaporation into the corona takes place .",
    "the mass evaporation goes on until an equilibrium density is established .",
    "the gas evaporating into the corona still retains angular momentum and with the role of viscosity will differentially rotate around the central object . by friction the gas loses angular momentum and drifts inward , and thus continuously drains mass from the corona towards the central object .",
    "this is compensated by a steady mass evaporation flow from the underlying disk .",
    "the process is driven by the gravitational potential energy released by friction in the form of heat in the corona . therefore , mass accretes to the central object partially through the corona ( evaporated part ) and partially through the disk ( the left part of the supplying mass ) .",
    "such a model for black holes was established by meyer et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) .",
    "the inflow and outflow of mass , energy , and angular momentum between neighboring zones were included by meyer - hofmeister & meyer ( 2003 ) .",
    "the effect of the viscosity parameter @xmath35 is investigated by ( qiao & liu 2009 ) , and the effect of the magnetic parameter @xmath27 is studied by ( qian et al .",
    "the model we used here is based on liu & taam ( 2009 ) , in which the structure of the corona and the evaporation features are determined by the equation of state , equation of continuity , and equations of momentum and energy .",
    "the calculations show that the evaporation rate increases with decreasing distance in the outer region of the accretion disk , reaching a maximum value and then dropping towards the central black hole .",
    "taam et al .",
    "( 2012 ) generalized the results of disk evaporation model for black hole x - ray binaries by including the effect of viscosity parameters @xmath35 and magnetic parameter @xmath27 in accretion disks around a supermassive black hole .",
    "the maximum evaporation rate and the corresponding radius from the black hole as functions of @xmath35 and @xmath27 are given as ( taam et al .",
    "2012 ) , @xmath36 @xmath37 where the evaporation rate is in units of eddington accretion rate @xmath38 ( @xmath38 = @xmath39 ) , and the radius is in units of schwarzschild radius @xmath40 ( @xmath40= @xmath41 @xmath42 ) .",
    "if the accretion rate is higher than the maximum evaporation rate , the evaporation can only make a fraction of the disk accretion flow go to the corona and the optically thick disk is never completely truncated by evaporation .",
    "however , if the mass supply rate is less than the maximum evaporation rate , the matter in the inner region of the disk will be fully evaporated to form a geometrically thick , optically thin accretion inner region , which is generally called advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "the truncation radius of the disk can be generalized as ( taam et al .",
    "2012 ) , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass supply rate from the most outer region of the accretion disk .",
    "if @xmath35 , @xmath27 and @xmath44 are specified , we can self - consistently get a two - component structure of the accretion flow with an inner adaf and an outer truncated accretion disk .",
    "it can be seen that from equation ( [ tr ] ) , the truncation radius is very weakly dependent on @xmath35 , but strongly dependent on @xmath27 .",
    "it is argued that the effect of magnetic fields on evaporation rate is a competition between its tendency to increase the evaporation as a result of the energy balance and to decrease the evaporation as a result of the pressure balance . the additional pressure contributed by the magnetic fields results in a greater heating via the shear stress .",
    "this effect is similar to an increase viscosity parameter and leads to an increase of evaporation rate in the inner region with little effect in the outer region . in this paper , because we focus on the truncation of the accretion disk in the outer region , the additional pressure contribution suppresses the evaporation at all distances as a result of force balance .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field results in little change in the value of the maximal evaporation rate , but make the evaporate curve move systematically inward , which means the truncation radius will decrease for a given mass accretion rate .",
    "meanwhile , we address that equation ( [ tr ] ) is a good fit only when the mass accretion rate is less than half of the maximum evaporation rate , i.e. , @xmath45 @xmath46= @xmath47@xmath48 ( assuming a standard viscosity parameter @xmath49 ) .",
    "when the mass accretion rate is close to the maximum evaporation rate , the truncation radius deviates from the power - law expression of equation ( [ tr ] ) . in this case , the truncation radius will be determined by detailed numerical calculations ( taam et al .",
    "2012 ) .      inside the truncation radius ,",
    "the accretion flows are in the form of advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) or radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) from our disk - evaporation model ( rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 ; narayan et al . 1998 ; quataert 2001 ; narayan & mcclintock 2008 , and the references therein ) . the self - similar solution of adaf was first proposed by narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995b ) , with which the spectrum of transient sources a0620 - 00 and v404 cyg with lower luminosity were well fitted ( narayan et al .",

    "the bolometric correction @xmath7 as a function of @xmath142 for @xmath119 is plotted with a black short - dashed line in figure [ kappa ] , and for @xmath161 is plotted with a blue short - dashed line in figure [ kappa ] .    from figure [ kappa ] , it is clear that the bolometric correction strongly depends on @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath138 @xmath162 - @xmath7 correlation predicted by @xmath0 or @xmath9 can well explain the observations , while the prediction by @xmath1 severely deviates from the observations .",
    "although our model for larger @xmath27 can roughly interpret the @xmath138 @xmath162 - @xmath7 correlation , it is still a few sources lay below the model line .",
    "this may be because , in this work , for simplicity , we assume that , outside the truncation radius , the accretion flow exists in the form of a pure standard accretion disk",
    ". however , according to the disk evaporation model , outside the truncation radius , the matter should be in the form of `` disk+corona '' , but not the pure stand accretion disk .",
    "the emission from the corona will result in an increase of the x - ray emission , which will make the bolometric correction decrease .",
    "consequently , the model - predicted @xmath7 will systematically shift downward . we also need to keep in mind",
    "that , due to the inner adaf dominating the x - ray emission , the emission contribution from the outer corona to the bolometric correction will be very small , so still the data support a bigger value of @xmath0 or @xmath9",
    ".    theoretically , it would be useful to understand how the magnetic parameter is determined and how it is constrained .",
    "the value of @xmath27 can be approximately known from the numerical simulations ( e.g. , balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "detailed mhd numerical simulations for the formation of a magnetized corona have shown that a strongly magnetized corona can form above an initially weakly magnetized disk ( e.g. , miller & stone 2000 ; machida et al .",
    "2000 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ) .",
    "however , in the disk evaporation model , we consider a slab corona in a large vertical extent , in which the corona is vertically stratified , in contrast to an isothermal torus as from mhd simulations .",
    "furthermore , thermal conduction in vertical direction is taken into account , which will make an efficient mass evaporation from the disk to the corona , resulting in a higher mass density than in the coronal envelope seen in mhd simulations .",
    "more importantly , in the disk evaporation model , the electrons in the corona are assumed to be heated only by a transfer of energy from the ions to electrons via coulomb collisions , which is reasonable for the accretion with a lower mass accretion rate ( narayan 1995b ) .",
    "coulomb heating is the dominated heating mechanism for the electrons only if the magnetic field is strongly sub - equipartition ( i.e. , ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure @xmath163 10 ) ( malzac & belmont 2009 ) .",
    "the spectral modeling of sgr @xmath164 showed that an additional direct heating to electrons is required , which is probably produced by magnetohydrodynamics turbulence , magnetic reconnection and weak shocks ( yuan et al .",
    "however , the magnetic heating mechanism to the electrons is very unclear , consequently still a weak magnetic field , i.e. , a high value of @xmath27 is assured in the case of a lower mass accretion rate within the framework of disk evaporation model .",
    "based on the prediction by taam et al .",
    "( 2012 ) of a truncation radius of the accretion disk on the mass accretion rate by including the magnetic field , we have calculated the emergent spectrum of an inner adaf + an outer truncated accretion disk around a super - massive black hole .",
    "it is found that the disk evaporation model can roughly reproduce the observed anti - correlation between hard x - ray index @xmath165 and eddington ratio @xmath16 for @xmath18 in llagns . as shown by taam et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the truncation radius of the accretion disk is sensitive to the magnetic parameter @xmath27 , which consequently affects the emergent spectrum .",
    "our calculations show that the equipartition of gas pressure to magnetic pressure , i.e. , @xmath1 , failed to explain the observed anti - correlation between @xmath6 and the bolometric correction @xmath7 .",
    "the resulted spectra for larger value @xmath0 or @xmath9 can better explain the observed @xmath34-@xmath7 correlation . it is argued that in the disk evaporation model , the electrons in the corona are assumed to be heated only by a transfer of energy from the ions to electrons via coulomb collisions , which is reasonable for the accretion with a lower mass accretion rate .",
    "coulomb heating is the dominated heating mechanism for the electrons only if the magnetic field is strongly sub - equipartition , which is roughly consistent with observations .",
