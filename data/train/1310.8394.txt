    "the two - dimensional indirect excitons ( or exciton polaritons ) in double and wide single qws are one of the most prominent systems under study in condensed matter physics .",
    "it attracts wide attention because of its unique physical properties .",
    "the most important physical phenomenon widely studied both experimentally and theoretically is exciton bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "indirect excitons , being a bound state of the electron and hole localized in spatially separated qws , possesses a long life - time comparison with usual excitons .",
    "long life - time of indirect excitons at sufficiently low temperatures allows one to accumulate a large amount of excitons in the lowest quantum state , the bec phenomenon .",
    "being located in a solid state structure , bec of dipolar excitons undergoes the influence of imperfections .",
    "the effect of disorder on the bec properties was theoretically studied in literature ( see , for example  @xcite and references therein ) . in the present work we examine the opposite case - the effect of exciton bec on the spatial dependence of impurity potential in the qw , e.g. the screening phenomenon . on the one hand , the problem of the local perturbation potential screening by the bec of neutral particles is a general problem of condensed matter physics .",
    "it will be shown below that the screening phenomenon , in this situation , demonstrates sharp distinctions from the known results for electron gas . on the other hand ,",
    "its solution is of large importance for the explanation of existing experiments  @xcite .",
    "it should be also noted that the problem of the impurity screening by excitonic gas was studied in literature in the absence of excitonic bec @xcite , @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of the existence of exciton bec is mainly based on the optical arguments .",
    "we show in the present work that absorption of saw experimental technique widely used in earlier studies of two - dimensional electron gas may provide with an alternative method to study the dipolar excitons bec .",
    "moreover , using the saw technique allows one to detect both dark and bright exciton condensate on the equal footing , which is impossible to do with optical methods, in particular by means of the luminescence technique .    in our present paper",
    "we suggest the hybrid linbo@xmath0/dqw structure for studying the exciton bec by means of saw .",
    "we calculate below the saw absorption coefficient due to its interaction with condensate and noncondensate exciton particles at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "we show that saw absorption coefficient includes both belyaev and landau damping precesses .",
    "landau damping of saw phonons is absent at zero temperatures , and both belyaev mechanism and wave - transformation mechanism ( direct conversion of saw phonon to the bogolubov sound phonon ) occur .",
    "microscopic calculation shows that the belyaev damping process results in an unusual behavior of saw absorption vs concentration of the exciton condensate , e.g. there is a critical concentration value above which saw absorption vanishes .",
    "the landau damping of saw phonons appears at finite temperatures , but it is exponentially small at low temperatures ( the exact criterion will be given below ) .",
    "we assume that , even at small temperatures , the presence of exciton bec can be experimentally tested by measuring saw absorption .",
    "time - dependent bec density fluctuations ( collective modes ) are well studied in literature  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "depending on the relation between frequency @xmath1 and typical collision time @xmath2 , one can distinguish two limiting regimes .",
    "regime @xmath3 is referred to as collisionless regime , which is described either by popov effective field theory approach or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation  @xcite . in the opposite case @xmath4 the dynamic behavior of the condensate",

    "this response theory has been applied to studying the screening phenomena and saw damping in the excitonic bec .",
    "we demonstrate for the first time that the spatial behavior of the impurity screened potential substantially differs from the one known for a 2d electron gas system .",
    "the reason of this phenomena is the bosonic nature of the excitons and the possibility of their condensation .",
    "the saw damping , as it was shown here , has specific and unusual behavior vs excitonic density .",
    "it should be stressed out that such a behavior is held only in the presence of the excitonic bec .",
    "indeed , in the absence of bec , exciton gas absorbs the saw and its damping is a monotonic function of the exciton density @xcite .",
