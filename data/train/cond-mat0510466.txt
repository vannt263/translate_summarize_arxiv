    "the transition from regular to chaotic regime presents characteristics similar to phase transitions in statistical thermodynamics and an adequate statistical thermo - dynamical formalism has been developed for chaotic systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an introduction ) . the transition point , or border of chaos , is characterized by a null lyapunov exponent .",
    "the interesting features of this transition were first illustrated by the pioneering works of feigenbaum on the logistic map attractor at the infinite bifurcation point @xcite , immediately followed by a series of theoretical works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in these investigations a power - law behavior of the sensitivity function of the logistic map at the threshold of chaos was formulated and the values for the power - law exponent were analytically calculated .",
    "more recently tsallis @xcite introduced a formalism of non - extensive thermodynamics that allows to pass easily from the chaotic case to the null lyapunov exponent case , recovering the boltzmann gibbs ( bg ) formulation as a limit .",
    "this formalism enlightens the connections between chaos and border of chaos and , in particular , defines a generalized entropy as the quantity of physical interest .",
    "for example it has been shown @xcite that a strong analogy with the pesin identity @xcite exists among this generalized entropy and generalized polynomial sensitivity to initial conditions appropriate to describe the sensitivity at the infinite bifurcations point of the logistic map @xcite .",
    "also other statistical formalisms emerging within special relativity @xcite and quantum groups @xcite seem to describe well @xcite the analogies between the threshold of chaos and the fully chaotic regime , even if recently the non - extensive formalism has been strongly criticized @xcite revealing a still open debate on the subject . at this time",
    "a lot of experimental results ( see @xcite for a review ) seem to confirm at least part of the theoretical framework of the non - extensive formalism . in this paper we performed various numerical experiments devoted to investigate the logistic map at transition points presenting different routes to chaos .",
    "thus our study regards different border of chaos regimes with different attractors underlying the dynamics .",
    "we present a joint analysis of ( generalized , coarse grained ) entropy and occupation number .",
    "we investigate the dynamics at large times and at large sampling ratios and analyze border of chaos transitions different from the feigenbaum attractor in the logistic map .",
    "finally we examine the presence of oscillations in the convergence to the attractor .",
    "in this paper we describe a set of numerical experiments , performed on the logistic map at the onset of chaos , with the purpose of examining the dynamics of a statistical ensemble of points , starting from far - from - equilibrium initial conditions . in each experiment the available phase space is partitioned in a number w@xmath1 of elementary , equal cells . a set of n points is randomly selected in the phase space according to two kinds of initial set - ups , and iterated according to the map . in these experiments",
    "we used the logistic map in the form @xmath2 we investigated the parameter values @xmath3 = 2 for the fully chaotic case , @xmath4 = 1.401155189 .. at the feigenbaum attractor , @xmath5 = 1.75 at the tangent bifurcation and @xmath6 = 2/@xmath7 when the logistic is generalized with inflection 1/2 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the first kind of initial start - up is from concentrated initial conditions ( i. c. ) .",
    "all the n points are chosen , with a uniform random distribution , inside a single cell of the partition , itself chosen at random . in the second kind of experiment all the n initial points are uniformly and randomly distributed in all the available phase space ( spread i. c. ) .",
    "the i - th cell will contain a fraction n@xmath9/n of the total number of points ( @xmath10 ) , so that one can naively define a probability of occupation for the i - th cell through @xmath11 with the constraint @xmath12 .",
    "on one hand we observe , for both kinds of experiments ( concentrated and spread i. c. ) the occupation number in time , namely the number of non empty cells of the partition . on the other hand ,",
    "the other quantity of interest in our discussion is the physical entropy , defined as coarse - grained entropy through the probabilities @xmath13 .",
    "we will use the tsallis definition of entropy @xcite , useful to characterize the behavior at the onset of chaos where the lyapunov exponent vanishes : @xmath14 other definitions of entropies @xcite would also work for the purposes of this paper .",
    "the analysis is performed through comparisons of the various behaviors between chaotic regime and border of chaos .",
    "we use different partitions w@xmath1 and different _ sampling ratios r _ , defined as @xmath15=n / w@xmath1 , that gives an indication of the goodness of sampling .",
    "the fact that the lyapunov exponent is zero at the threshold of chaos , allows us to use power - laws to characterize the evolution @xcite .",
    "the comparison with the chaotic case makes natural to pass from an `` exponential formalism '' to an `` extended exponential formalism '' describing the power - law @xcite . as discussed in @xcite , in the chaotic regime , the ( averaged ) time evolution of the map ,",
    "starting from concentrated initial conditions , may happen in two or three stages : a first `` thermalization '' stage heavily dependent on the details of the initial conditions ; a second `` linear '' stage in which the coarse grained boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropy @xmath16 grows linearly with time and a third `` saturation '' stage in which @xmath16 reaches its final equilibrium value .    in the fully chaotic regime , when proper average is made on different experiments of the same kind ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the evolution of the logistic map , starting from concentrated initial conditions ( cic ) , exhibits an initial exponential growth of the occupation number without a first thermalization stage .",
    "a saturation is reached , depending on the grid size , when n@xmath17 equals the fractal support value ( n@xmath17 = w@xmath1 for @xmath3 = 2 ) . the coarse grained version of the bg entropy shows a linear initial increase followed by a saturation at a s@xmath18 level ( s@xmath19 ) when starting from cic .",
    "a pesin - like identity can be observed for the coarse - grained bg entropy . using for this case",
    "a non - extensive formalism @xcite , a linear growth of s@xmath20 in the first evolution stage can be found and a pesin - like identity can be recovered , if the appropriate entropic index is selected .",
    "thus some features of the chaotic case can be directly transferred to the threshold of chaos .",
    "it is important to note that in the chaotic case the evolution happens in only two stages . in this paper",
    "we are interested in clarify how the final saturation stage is reached at the onset of chaos . to this aim",
    "we studied the evolution at longer times than the previous works .",
    "the results are illustrated in figs.[fig : nocccriticpofig ] and [ fig : sqcriticpofig ] , where , differently from the chaotic case , we can observe roughly three stages .",
    "the first stage is the analogue of the chaotic one : both @xmath21 and @xmath22 increase and reach a maximum .",
    "the duration of this first stage becomes longer and the maximum level higher increasing w@xmath1 , while they do not depend on @xmath15 .",
    "as previously stressed @xcite , in this first `` linear '' stage , @xmath22 grows linearly only for the proper entropic index ( @xmath23 when @xmath24 ) . in the second stage",
    "both @xmath21 and @xmath22 decrease .",
    "@xmath21 follows a power - law with superimposed log - log oscillations which amplitude increases with @xmath15 and does not depend on w@xmath1 . for low enough @xmath25 values , @xmath22 reproduces the @xmath21 behavior ( when @xmath26 results @xmath27 ) , but the amplitude of oscillations decreases with increasing @xmath25 and vanishes when @xmath28 ( see fig.[fig : sqcriticpofig ] right frame ) . in the third stage @xmath21 and @xmath22 reach their ( w@xmath1 dependent ) saturation values and the evolution ends .",
    "note that the saturation is reached at a level that increases with w@xmath1 , but @xmath21 results in a lower final value than the fractal support , that is equal to @xmath29 ( 799 ) for w@xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .     for the logistic map at @xmath4 .",
