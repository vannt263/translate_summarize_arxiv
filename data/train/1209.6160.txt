    "the latest measurement of the shapiro delay for the millisecond pulsar psrj1614 - 2230 provides reliable lower bound on the maximum mass to be @xmath2 @xcite . this measurement rules out all the equations of state ( eoss ) yielding the maximum mass less than that of the psrj1614 - 2230",
    "of course , the eoss for the nucleonic matter can readily yield the compact stars with masses @xmath3 .",
    "the eoss with hadron - quark phase transition are also compatible with the mass measurement of the psrj1614 - 2230 , provided , the quarks are assumed to be strongly interacting and are in colour superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "however , at large , the maximum mass of the compact stars are found to be well below @xmath0 when the non - nucleonic degrees of freedom like hyperons and kaon condensates are considered @xcite . one might thus infer in the backdrop of previous calculations that the existence of hyperons and kaon condensates are unlikely in the psrj1614 - 2230 .",
    "recently , studies involving role of hyperons on the maximum mass of the compact stars are revisited @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the eos for the hyperonic matter at higher densities can be stiffened in several ways within the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models .",
    "the maximum mass for these eoss are above @xmath0 indicating the existence of hyperons in the psrj1614 - 2230 .",
    "the eos of the hyperonic matter are stiffened by including the vector - isoscalar strange @xmath4 mesons within the rmf model , in addition to the usual scalar - isoscalar @xmath5 , vector - isoscalar @xmath6 and vector - isovector @xmath7 mesons @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 mesons stiffens the eos at densities far beyond the nuclear saturation density .",
    "further , the increase of about @xmath8 in the maximum mass of the compact stars is achieved by varying the hyperon - nucleon potential depths for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 hyperons which are not very well known .",
    "it has been also demonstrated @xcite that maximum mass of the compact stars containing hyperons are well above @xmath11 , provided , the @xmath6 mesons are coupled to hyperons as strongly as to the nucleons .",
    "such strong meson - hyperon couplings stemmed from the breaking of su(6 ) symmetry . another way to stiffen",
    "the eos is to include the non - linear terms for the @xmath4-mesons as suggested in ref .",
    "it may be pointed out that the nuclear eoss employed in ref .",
    "@xcite are generally quite stiff in comparison to those extracted from the heavy - ion data @xcite",
    ".    an alternative scenario has also emerged in which compact stars containing hyperons can have masses @xmath3 . in this scenario",
    ", one assumes the presence of hypothetical weakly interacting light bosons ( wilbs ) at densities several times of the nuclear saturation density .",
    "the role of wilbs on the eos or the internal structure of the compact stars crucially depends on the choice of the characteristic scale which is the square of the ratio of the coupling strength to the masses of wilbs .",
    "the values of the characteristic scale of the wilbs are poorly constrained at present by the laboratory data and the compact star observable @xcite .",
    "consequently , the nuclear eoss compatible with the heavy - ion data allow the hyperons to exist in the compact stars with mass @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the required stiffness of the eos at very high density is achieved by adjusting the characteristic scale of the wilbs .    in the present work",
    "we explore the possibility of existence of hyperons in the psrj1614 - 2230 using a diverse set of nuclear eoss calculated within the rmf models .",
    "in particular , we examine whether the nuclear eoss compatible with the heavy - ion data can allow the hyperons to exist in the psrj1614 - 2230 without recourse to the wilbs .",
    "this makes our present investigation quite different than the ones performed earlier .",
    "most of the previous investigations either employed the nuclear eoss which are stiffer in comparison to the heavy - ion data or included the contributions of the wilbs .",
