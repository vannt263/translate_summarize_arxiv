    "spin ices have been extensively studied as ideal systems that exhibit geometric frustration effects since not all the pairwise spin interactions can be satisfied simultaneously @xcite .",
    "such systems are termed spin ices due to their similarity with a water ice phase in which proton ordering into corner - sharing tetrahedra is frustrated but obeys the `` ice rule '' of two protons `` in '' ( close to the o atom ) and two protons `` out '' ( far from the o atom ) in every tetrahedron @xcite . in spin ices , the corresponding spin ice rules determine how many spins point toward or away from each vertex in the system , and these rules vary depending on the geometry of the system .",
    "for example , in two dimensional ( 2d ) square ice , ice - rule - obeying states have two spins pointing toward each vertex and two spins pointing away , and it is possible for the spins to organize into an ordered ground state configuration @xcite . for 2d kagome ice , ice - rule - obeying states have two spins in and one spin out out or two spins out and one spin in ; in this case , the lowest energy state is not ordered but contains only vertices that obey these ice rules .",
    "there has recently been growing interest in 2d artificial spin ice systems created using nanomagnetic arrays @xcite , 2d colloidal particle assemblies @xcite , or vortices in nanostructured superconductors @xcite . in the nanomagnetic arrays , the orientation of the magnetic moment of each nanoisland produces the effective spin ordering .",
    "the colloidal and vortex systems more closely resemble the water ice system in that the repulsive interactions of the colloids or vortices at vertices resemble the interactions between charged protons , and the ice rules indicate the number of colloids or vortices that sit close to or away from a vertex .",
    "experimental versions of these systems allow for direct imaging of the microscopic spin configurations as well as for careful control of numerous parameters that are not accessible in real spin systems",

    "@xcite on 2d square ice , as the interactions between neighboring nanomagnets increased , the system was increasingly filled with ice - rule - obeying vertices ; however , the predicted ground state was not observed due to quenched disorder effects in the nanomagnet array .",
    "experiments on kagome artificial ice systems soon followed and showed that the ice rules predicted for that geometry were obeyed @xcite . in more recent square ice studies using more advanced techniques , large regions of the sample adopted the square ice ground state while non - ice - rule obeying vertices created grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "such grain boundary formation was previously predicted in vortex simulations to occur for weak quenched disorder , while for stronger disorder isolated non - ice - rule defects begin to appear @xcite .",
    "lack of thermalization is an issue for the experimental nanomagnet systems since thermal activation of the spin configurations is weak or nonexistent .",
    "this can be partially mitigated by applying a changing external field @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that biased states appear under applied external fields for both square and kagome ice systems , while cycled external fields can be used to generate hysteresis curves @xcite .",
    "for kagome ice , zabel _",
    "_ @xcite observed an ordered monopole state where each vertex has either all spins pointing out or all spins pointing in , with the vertices alternating sign in a crystalline arrangement .",
    "other studies have examined the creation and motion of monopole excitations in the presence of a biasing field for both square and kagome ice systems @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies have found that 2d kagome ice can undergo a two - stage ordering transition from a paramagnetic state to an ice - rule - obeying state followed by an ordered monopole state @xcite .",
    "the thermal disordering or melting of the ordered states can be readily studied in colloidal artificial ices , and recently materials have been created with a spin ordering temperature that is near room temperature , making it now possible to melt magnetic artificial spin ices @xcite .",
    "here we show that a variety of different types of orderings are possible in both kagome and modified square ice systems as a function of external field , temperature , and interaction strength for a colloidal artificial spin ice system composed of arrays of elongated optical traps that each capture one colloid .",
    "experimental studies have demonstrated frustration in buckled 2d colloidal layers @xcite while numerical studies have shown that charged colloids in elongated trap arrays exhibit the same spin ice rules observed for nanomagnet arrays @xcite .",
    "computational and experimental studies of colloidal ordering on 2d square and triangular substrates have revealed numerous ordered states and multi - step transitions between the states @xcite .",
    "the elongated optical traps we consider here permit each colloid to sit in one of two locations at either end of the trap .",
    "arrays of this type of trap have been created experimentally to study various types of ratchet effects , and preferential ordering of the colloids into a state that minimized the colloid - colloid interactions was observed @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the colloidal system over the nanomagnetic systems is that thermal activation of the effective spin degrees of freedom is possible .",
    "the relative importance of the thermal fluctuations can be varied either by adjusting the temperature or by holding the temperature fixed and modifying the strength of the colloid - colloid interactions .",
    "it is also possible to bias the colloidal artificial ice system using an electric field .        _",
    "simulation- _ we consider a 2d array of @xmath0 elongated traps that each contain a single colloid .",
    "each trap has two potential minima where the colloid can sit , as shown in figure 1(a ) where we illustrate a single vertex of the square ice system .",
    "the effective spin at each site is defined to point toward the end of the trap occupied by the colloid .",
    "the colloids interact with each other via a repulsive screened coulomb or yukawa potential given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the screening length and @xmath3 is the average spacing between the vertices .",
    "since the colloids are repulsive it is very energetically costly for all the colloids around a vertex to sit close to the vertex in a positive monopole state ; on the other hand , the lowest energy state for a vertex is the negative monopole configuration in which all the colloids sit away from the vertex . due to geometrical constraints",
    "it is not possible for all of the vertices to adopt negative monopole configurations . the most cost - effective way to accommodate",
    "the colloid - colloid repulsion in the square ice is for each vertex to have two close colloids and two far colloids in a `` two in - two out '' state that obeys the square ice rules .",
    "these ice rule obeying states can be biased , with the close colloids occupying traps oriented at 90@xmath4 to each other , or they can be the slightly lower energy ground state configuration shown in figure  1(a ) @xcite . for kagome ice , shown schematically in figure 1(b ) , the ice rule obeying vertices have either two in and one out or one out and two in .",

    "@xmath120 peaks near @xmath122 in figure 9(c ) and the sample enters the biased ice rule obeying configuration ( with thermal defects ) shown in figure 10(c ) . since the @xmath87 vertices have a slightly higher energy than the ground state @xmath92 vertices @xcite , at even higher temperatures additional hopping produces an increased fraction of @xmath92 vertices , placing the system in the thermally induced and thermally defected square ice ground state configuration illustrated in figure 10(d ) . for sufficiently high @xmath68 ,",

    "our results indicate that a simple modification of the square ice geometry can produce a wealth of orderings in the artificial spin ice system .",
    "we note that the phase diagrams for the kagome and modified square ice presented here do not exhibit true phases since we have driven the system into a metastable state . in many of the nanomagnetic systems that exhibit hysteresis , most of the observed states are also metastable unless a successful annealing protocol has been applied .",
    "all of our samples contained no quenched disorder .",
    "we expect that many of the states we observe would be gradually washed out if increasing amounts of quenched disorder are added ; however , there should still be observable correlations in the different states that can be detected by analyzing the vertex population densities .",

    "we show that multiple - step ordering - disordering transitions occur that can be identified by counting the vertex populations . in the kagome ice",
    ", an ordered monopole state can be induced by applying a biasing field to samples with pairwise interactions that are not too strong . with increasing temperature",
    ", the system crosses into an ice rule obeying state and then into a high temperature paramagnetic state . for stronger pairwise interactions ,",
    "the monopole state is unstable to the formation of the ice rule obeying state .",
    "our results suggest that recent experimental observations of monopole ordering in kagome nanomagnetic systems were performed in a weakly interacting or noninteracting regime . for square ice",
    ", we make a simple modification to the geometry by introducing two sublattices of traps that have different switching fields and show that under the application of an external biasing field , this system can form a checkerboard ordered monopole state .",
    "the modified square ice exhibits multi - state ordering as a function of temperature starting from the monopole state , passing through a biased triple state , a thermally induced biased ice rule obeying state , a thermally induced square ice ground state , and a disordered or paramagnetic state .",
