    "recently , the fast development of radio frequency ( rf)-based wireless power transfer ( wpt ) technology@xcite makes it possible to build wireless powered communication networks ( wpcns)@xcite , in which can be remotely powered over the air by dedicated wireless energy transmitters . compared with traditional battery - powered networks , wpcn avoids the manual battery replacement / recharging , which reduces the network maintenance and operation cost greatly . as the transmit power , waveforms , and occupied time / frequency dimensions , etc .",
    ", of wpt are all controllable and tunable , it is capable of providing stable energy supply under various physical conditions and communication requirements in wpcns@xcite .",
    "it was reported that tens of micowatts rf power can be transferred to a distance of more than 10 meters by using rf - based wpt@xcite .",
    "the energy is sufficient to power the low - power communication devices ( e.g. , sensors and rf identification ( rfid ) tags ) .",
    "thanks to the rapid evolution of multi - antenna energy beamforming@xcite , high - efficiency energy harvesting ( eh ) circuit design@xcite and energy efficient communication system design@xcite , rf - based wpt has been regarded promising and attractive solution to prolong the lifetime of low - power energy - constrained networks , such as wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) , wireless body area networks ( wbans ) and internet of things ( iot ) in future 5 g systems@xcite .",
    "since rf signals also carry energy when they transfer information , simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) technology was proposed@xcite , which has captured greatly attention .",
    "it was proved that swipt is more efficient in spectrum usage than transmitting information and energy in orthogonal time/ frequency / spacial channels@xcite .",
    "so far , swipt - enabled wpcns have been attracting increasing interests , see e.g.    in this paper , we investigate the group cooperation with optimal resource allocation in wpcns .",
    "we consider a network composed of two communication groups , where the group 1 has sufficient supply but no licensed bandwidth , and the group 2 has licensed bandwidth but no sufficient . therefore , neither group can fulfill the information delivering to meet its desired information transmission rate . considering that swipt provides an effective approach for information transmission and energy cooperation between nodes , we introduce the between the two groups , so that group 1 may transfer some to group 2 and then get some from group 2 in return . with this inter - group cooperation",
    ", both groups can achieve their expected information rates .",
    "for such a wpcn with group cooperation , our goal is to explore its performance limits in terms of wsr and the minimum consumed power .    of our work",
    "are emphasized as follows .",
    ", different from some existing works on one - hop wpcns , see e.g. , @xcite , where only point - to - point communication was investigated , in our work , cooperative relaying[multiblock footnote omitted ] is involved .",
    "although some works studied the relay - aided wpcn systems , see e.g. @xcite ,    the _ contributions _ of our work are summarized as follows .",
    "_ firstly _ , we propose a group - cooperation based cooperative transmission protocol for the considered wpcn ,    _ secondly _ , to explore the information transmission performance limit of the system , we formulate two optimization problems to maximize the system wsr by jointly optimizing the time assignment and beamforming vector under two different power constraints , i.e. , the fixed power and the flexible power constraints . in order to achieve the  win - win \" cooperation between the two groups and guarantee their qos requirements , the minimal required information rate constraints of the two groups are also considered in the optimal system design . as both problems are non - convex and have no known solution methods , we transform them into equivalently ones with some variable substitutions and then solve them by using semi - definite relaxation ( sdr ) method .",
    "we theoretically prove that our proposed solution method can guarantee to find the global optimal solution .",
    "_ thirdly _ , consider that wpcns have promising application potentials in future energy - constrained networks , in which the power consumption reduction is very critical and the green communication design @xcite is very essential .",
    "we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total consumed power of the wpcn by jointly optimizing the time assignment and beamforming vector under required data rate constraints of the two groups . as the problem is non - convex",
    ", we also solve it efficiently by using some variable substitutions and the sdr method .",
    "the global optimum of our proposed minimal power consumption system design is also theoretically proved .",
    "_ fourthly _ , numerical results are presented to discuss the system performance behaviors , which provide some useful insights for future wpcn design .",
    "it shows that the average power constrained system achieves higher wsr than the fixed power constrained system    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model .",
    "section and iv investigate the wsr maximization and power minimization design of our considered wpcn , respectively .",

    "for group 1 , @xmath0 is with stable and sufficient supply but no licensed bandwidth , so it can not transmit information to @xmath1 . for group 2 , @xmath2 has licensed bandwidth but it is located relatively far away from @xmath3 , so it can not achieve high enough data rate over @xmath4 direct link to meet its required information rate .",
    "thus , @xmath2 needs @xmath5 to help it forward information to @xmath3 .",

    "<S> this paper considers a wireless powered communication network ( wpcn ) with group cooperation , where two communication groups cooperate with each other via wireless power transfer and time sharing to fulfill their expected information delivering . to explore the system performance limits , we formulate optimization problems to respectively maximize the weighted sum - rate ( wsr ) and minimize the total consumed power . </S>",

    "<S> both fixed and flexible power scenarios are investigated . as all problems are non - convex and have no known solution methods , we solve them by using proper variable substitutions and the semi - definite relaxation ( sdr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically prove that our proposed solution method guarantees the global optimum for each problem . </S>",
