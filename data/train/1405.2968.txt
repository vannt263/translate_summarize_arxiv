    "eigensystems of dirac operator in equilibrium gauge backgrounds carry the information on fermionic aspects of quark  gluon dynamics . as an important example ,",
    "inspection of dirac spectral representation for scalar fermionic density immediately reveals that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( schsb ) is equivalent to mode condensation of massless dirac operator . ever since this association has been pointed out  @xcite , it became popular to think about schsb in terms of quark near  zeromodes .",
    "contrary to schsb , the mode condensation property is a well  defined notion in generic quark  gluon system , i.e. even when all quarks are massive .",
    "while there is no chiral symmetry of physical degrees of freedom to break in this case , condensing dynamics can still be described via chiral symmetry considerations .",
    "indeed , one can introduce e.g. a pair of fictitious fermionic fields ( `` valence quarks '' ) of degenerate mass @xmath9 , and cancel their contribution to the action by also adding the associated bosonic partners  @xcite .",
    "this keeps the dynamics of physical quarks and gluons unchanged , but makes it meaningful to consider chiral rotations of valence fields in such extended system , and to inquire about `` valence schsb '' in the @xmath10 limit . in this language , @xmath11 i.e. quark mode condensation ( qmc ) in arbitrary quark  gluon system is equivalent to valence spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( vschsb ) : dynamics supports condensing modes if and only if it supports valence chiral condensate and valence goldstone pions .",
    "it is useful to think about schsb in the above more general sense , especially when inquiring about the mechanism underlying the phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the response of massless valence quarks to gauge backgrounds of various quark ",
    "gluon systems provides a relevant point of dynamical distinction for associated theories : they either support `` broken '' or `` symmetric '' dynamics of the external massless probe .",
    "moreover , valence schsb is readily observed in lattice simulations with physically relevant flavor arrangements , and the associated dynamical characteristics change smoothly in the light quark regime  @xcite .",
    "valuable lessons on schsb can thus be learned by studying its valence version with massive dynamical quarks : vschsb becomes schsb as dynamical chiral limit is approached .",
    "unfortunately , the equivalence of quark mode condensation and valence schsb does not provide window into specifics of broken quark dynamics .",
    "indeed , the mode condensation property is merely a restatement of symmetry breakdown condition in dirac spectral representation .",
    "however , it was recently proposed that another relation may hold , possibly with similar scope of validity , but with non  trivial dynamical connection to inner workings of the breaking phenomenon  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was suggested that @xmath12 i.e. that valence schsb is equivalent to _ dynamical chirality condensation _ ( dchc ) .",
    "this offers an intuitively appealing notion that the vacuum effect of chiral symmetry breaking is in fact the phenomenon of chirality condensation . in light of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the above relation carries the same information as qmc ",
    "dchc equivalence , which may be preferable for explicit checks .    while entities involved in the above relations will all be defined in sec .",

    "right components ( local chiral polarization ) , measured with respect to the baseline of statistical independence .",
    "the associated quantifier , the correlation coefficient of polarization @xmath13 $ ] , is invariant with respect to the choice of parametrization for the asymmetry .",
    "it thus provides the information on the quark ",

    "dchc occurs when near  zeromodes are chirally polarized ( @xmath14 ) and sufficiently abundant , namely when _ chiral polarization density _",
    "@xmath15 is positive at @xmath16 in infinite volume .",
    "important aspect of dchc is that it manifests itself in chiral spectral properties away from strictly infrared limit .",
    "indeed , it was shown  @xcite that mode  condensing theories of physical interest exhibit _ chiral polarization scale _ @xmath0 , marking the spectral point where functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 change sign and modes become anti  polarized ( fig .  [",

    "the existence of @xmath0 in chirally broken asymptotically free theories can be intuitively understood from the fact that free modes are strictly anti ",

    "thus both broken and symmetric theories are included in this landscape with corresponding transitions providing for most interesting tests of the conjecture .",
    "while the maximal range of validity may be significantly larger , this is a physically relevant setup currently associated with the above statements .",
    "the focus of this work involves two main aspects .    _",
    "( i ) _ in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] we provide more complete description of chiral polarization phenomenon , and formulate the proposed connections to vschsb within such wider context .",
    "refined description reflects the premise that the vacuum feature we are associating with vschsb is the layer of chirally polarized modes around @xmath22 ( `` surface of the dirac sea '' ) . apart from its width ( @xmath1 ) , global characterization of this structure also includes volume density of modes involved ( @xmath2 ) , and the volume density of total chirality generated by them ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "incorporating these characteristics allows us to distinguish and discuss various special / singular cases that might arise .",
    "for example , the layer could approach zero width in the infinite volume limit , but acquire sufficiently singular abundance of modes so as to generate positive @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : illus](middle ) ) .",
    "another possibility is that polarization density asymptotically vanishes on the layer , due to modes being concentrated on a subset of space  time with measure zero , but @xmath2 remains positive in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illus](right ) .",
    "even if behaviors of the above type wo nt appear in target continuum theories , they are likely to show up at low lattice cutoffs .",
    "working within a framework capturing such cases is beneficial to make the proposed connections as universal as possible .",
    "related to the above is a suggestion , described in sec .",
    "[ ssec : finvol ] , whose conceptual content goes beyond that in ref .",
    "@xcite . to convey this ,",
    "note that our discussion implicitly proceeded in infinite volume where the notions of condensate and symmetry breaking are defined .",
    "for example , the generic form of relation in the extended framework ( see _ conjecture 2  _ ) is @xmath23 implying that appearance of chirally polarized layer around the surface of dirac sea is considered to be physically significant if @xmath24 .",
    "theories without polarized low modes in large finite volumes ( @xmath25 identically zero ) are then predicted to be unbroken , but theories with polarized low modes ( @xmath26 ) could also be unbroken if @xmath27 .",
    "consistently with available data , we propose in _ conjecture 3 _ that the latter possibility does not occur : if large  volume dynamics generates chiral polarization in low end of the spectrum , then valence chiral condensate appears in the infinite volume limit and vice versa .",
    "this provides for the closest possible relationship between vschsb and chiral polarization ( chp ) , and it is in this sense that we refer to @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 as _ finite  volume `` order parameters''_. , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 are zero / non  zero simultaneously in finite volume : they effectively represent a single finite  volume order parameter .",
    "] in this context , the correspondence analogous to is expressed as @xmath28 and the right - hand side of relation modifies to : @xmath29 for @xmath30 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ we present new lattice data supporting the above ideas .",
    "it is known that , at zero temperature , n@xmath4=0 theory  @xcite as well as n@xmath4=2 + 1 theory at physical point  @xcite exhibit chiral polarization , in accordance with the presence of vschsb , and thus with the proposed equivalence .",
    "there is also an initial evidence that subjecting n@xmath4=0 qcd to thermal agitation , chiral polarization and vschsb cease to exist at common temperature t@xmath31 @xcite . when contemplating the validity of the vschsb ",
    "chp relationship over the vast theory landscape considered , it is useful to think of n@xmath4=0 , t=0 theory as a reference point  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this dynamics produces maximal breaking of valence chiral symmetry , with thermal effects and the effects of light dynamical quarks providing two possible routes to symmetry restoration .",
    "thus , in pilot investigations , it is natural to examine these two deformations of quenched theory independently of one another , both to ascertain conjecture s validity in such instances , as well as to learn about specific features associated with the two qualitatively different effects .",
    "this work is the first step in that direction with finite  temperature aspect examined in sec .",
    "[ sec : fintemp ] , and many  flavor dynamics in sec .",
    "[ sec : light ] .",
    "all of our results are consistent with the vschsb  chp equivalence .",
    "few noteworthy byproducts of our main inquiry are also discussed here . _",
    "( i ) _ performing a volume analysis at the lattice cutoff studied , we show the existence of the ( lattice ) phase @xmath32 in n@xmath4=0 , simultaneously exhibiting vschsb and deconfinement  @xcite .",
    "this chiral polarization dynamics appears to be of the singular type @xmath33 . _",
    "( ii ) _ one of the characteristic features of the above `` mixed phase '' is the appearance of very inhomogeneous near  zeromodes , well distinguished from the bulk of the spectrum . we find an intermediate phase ( in quark mass ) with such properties also in n@xmath4=12 .",
    "the relevance of these phases for continuum physics remains an open issue in both cases . _ ( iii )",
    "_ elementary analysis of the detailed chiral polarization characteristic , namely absolute distribution , is also performed . among other things ,",
    "our data in n@xmath4=0 indicate that deconfinement is characterized by the appearance of distributions with indefinite convexity .",
    "we start by reviewing the relevant background , and formulating the connections we aim to test . our discussion will be fairly detailed and self  contained , in part to sufficiently extend pertinent parts of letter  @xcite which were necessarily rather brief .",
    "in addition , we build an extended formalism for description of chiral polarization , which allows us to include special / singular behaviors and has some benefits for continuum  limit considerations .",
    "implicitly assumed in what follows is the setup involving su(3 ) gluons interacting with n@xmath4 fundamental quarks of masses @xmath34 . to formally include valence chiral symmetry considerations ,",
    "the system is augmented by a pair of degenerate valence quarks of mass @xmath9 , and a pair of complex commuting fields ( pseudofermions ) compensating for the dynamical effect of these fictitious particles  @xcite .",
    "this schematically corresponds to the action , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pure glue contribution . when viewing the above as expression in the continuum , then @xmath37 , namely the continuum dirac operator .",
    "however , on the lattice it is possible , and sometimes desirable , to consider different discretizations for dynamical and valence quarks . in particular , the role of @xmath38 in our case is to describe the response of physical vacuum to external chiral probe .",
    "it is thus desirable that it provides for exact lattice chiral symmetry , even though some numerically cheaper @xmath39 could have been used to simulate physical quarks and to define the theory .",
    "flavored chiral rotations of valence quark fields in the above extended system become the symmetry of the action in the @xmath10 limit , and one can meaningfully ask whether this symmetry is broken by the vacuum .",
    "if so , we speak of _ valence chiral symmetry breaking _ ( vschsb ) .",
    "it has the usual consequence of being associated with the triplet of massless valence pions .",
    "while these are not physical states , they express the ability of the physical vacuum to support a specific type of long range order : the same kind of order that is required for physical chiral symmetry to be broken in the dynamical massless limit .",
    "vschsb is thus a relevant vacuum characteristic of qcd  like theories .",
    "following the steps involved in derivation of the standard banks ",
    "casher relation  @xcite , one can inspect that the valence chiral condensate in theory ( [ eq:2.015 ] ) is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is one ( arbitrary ) of the valence flavors , @xmath42 the cumulative eigenmode density of @xmath38 and @xmath43 the 4volume . in the continuum , @xmath44 is the cumulative eigenmode density of continuum dirac operator . on the lattice , we implicitly assume that @xmath38 is the overlap dirac operator  @xcite which is our discretization of choice in this study , and for which the relation such as ( [ eq:2.025 ] ) can be straightforwardly derived  @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ cumulative eigenmode density _ , used above , is defined as @xmath45 where @xmath19 ( real number ) represents the imaginary part of dirac eigenvalue . in case of overlap dirac operator",
    "one can also take it to be the magnitude of the eigenvalue multiplied by the sign of the imaginary part .",
    "@xmath46 are the values associated with given gauge background and ordered appropriately .",
    "note that @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "the differential version of @xmath49 , referred to as _ eigenmode density _ , is generally available and frequently useful , namely @xmath50 note that we chose to distinguish the above eigenmode density from the usual @xmath51 which , in some singular cases , has to be represented by a generalized function with at most countably many `` atoms '' ( @xmath52functions ) , while @xmath53 is always an ordinary function which simply takes the value `` @xmath54 '' at the position of the atoms .",
    "the infinite volume limit of @xmath55 will be defined as @xmath56 rather than as point  wise limit of @xmath55 , but the two can only differ in certain singular points of the spectrum . the theory is said to exhibit _ quark mode condensation _ ( qmc ) if @xmath57 i.e. when the abundance of `` infinitely infrared '' modes scales as the total number of modes , namely with space  time volume .",
    "relation then implies @xmath58 which is an explicit representation of equivalence ( [ eq:005 ] ) between vschsb and qmc .",
    "few remarks regarding the above should now be made .    _",
    "( i ) _ the discussion has been carried out at a rather general level mainly to accommodate the possibility of most singular behavior at the origin in the infinite volume limit . if @xmath16 is the only `` atom '' in that situation , then @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being an ordinary function , and @xmath61 .",
    "we then have @xmath62 since @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , in addition to the usual second term , mode condensate acquires an infinite value if there is an atom of spectral mode density at the origin .",
    "can in principle be infinite even when @xmath64 since @xmath65 could still have an ordinary integrable divergence at @xmath16 .",
    "] this is in accordance with diverging chiral condensate in such instance , namely @xmath66 we emphasize that the singular accumulation of modes discussed above is not due to exact zero  modes of finite volumes : their contribution is well  known to vanish in the infinite volume limit .",
    "rather , @xmath67 would have to be generated by modes that are `` squeezed '' into near ",
    "zeromodes at arbitrary finite volume but become `` infinitely infrared '' as volume is taken to infinity . it is not known whether there are continuum theories generating such dynamics , but we will discuss the behavior that might be of this type at finite cutoff .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ it should be noted that , at finite cutoff , it is in principle possible to obtain contradictory answers on vschsb ( qmc ) with different choices of @xmath38 .",
    "however , such discrepancies , if any , are expected to disappear sufficiently close to the continuum limit .    _",
    "( iii ) _ in the above considerations we assumed @xmath68 for simplicity . incorporating theories on 3volume @xmath69 at finite temperature @xmath70",
    "is straightforward and simply involves replacing @xmath71 in labels , and @xmath72 in volume factors .",
    "the term _ `` dynamical local chirality '' _ refers to characterization of local asymmetry in left ",
    "right values of dirac eigenmodes using absolute polarization method of ref .",
    ". dynamical nature of this approach mainly stems from the fact that it quantifies polarization relative to the population of statistically independent left ",
    "right components .",
    "the basic characteristic is the correlation coefficient of polarization @xmath73 $ ] , assigned to a given eigenmode @xmath74 .",
    "it is linearly related to the probability that the local value of @xmath74 is more polarized than value chosen from associated distribution of statistically independent left ",
    "right components . in case of correlation ( @xmath75 )",
    ", dynamics enhances polarization and the mode is referred to as chirally polarized , while anti  correlation ( @xmath76 ) indicates that dynamics suppresses polarization and the mode is chirally anti  polarized .",

    "a concise introduction to these concepts together with precise definitions can be found in appendix  [ app : chirality ] .",
    "spectral characteristics of a given theory based on dynamical chirality measures @xmath80 and @xmath78 can be defined as follows  @xcite .",
    "the cumulative dynamical chirality per unit volume ( _ cumulative chiral polarization density _ ) , is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is chiral polarization ( correlation ) in the k  th mode .",

    "the essential content of _ conjecture 2 _ can then be summarized by saying that quark ",
    "gluon dynamics breaks chiral symmetry if and only if it generates volume density of dynamical chirality .",
    "it is interesting to look back at fig .  2 in light of the above statement .",
    "indeed , assuming that various @xmath114 , @xmath18 shown represent infinite volume limits , the first pair of rows corresponds to options for chirally broken vacuum , the second pair is associated with symmetric vacuum , and the cases in the third pair do not occur on @xmath115 if _ conjecture 2 _ is valid .    with the same rationale that motivated _ conjecture 2 _ , we now put forward yet more generic association of chiral polarization and vschsb . in particular , it is possible to drop the notion that dchc is a necessary companion of vschsb , while still maintaining the connection to chiral polarization .",
    "this can arise when , in addition to simultaneous positivity , the pairwise equality of chiral polarization parameters is abandoned as well .",
    "the prototypical situation we have in mind is when @xmath146 converges to @xmath131 in the infinite volume limit , but @xmath147 scales to zero on interval @xmath132 .",

    ", it is useful to fix a convention regarding exact zero  modes .",
    "indeed , the default lattice setup in this discussion involves standard ( anti)periodic boundary conditions and the overlap dirac operator as a chiral probe .",

    "in fact , one useful advantage of using overlap operator is that it cleanly separates out topological modes , ensuring that their _ a priori _ local chirality does nt contaminate that of near ",
    "zeromodes which are of actual interest .",
    "the definition of chiral symmetry breaking in dirac eigenmode representation involves a strictly infrared condition : the existence of mode condensate ( qmc ) .",
    "this is of course not surprising : the strictly infrared nature of relevant mass ( @xmath158 ) gets translated into strictly infrared corner of the dirac spectrum ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , applying qmc condition to detect vschsb in finite volume is futile since it is never satisfied .",
    "indeed , @xmath159 is zero identically .",
    "this is symptomatic of the fact that vschsb @xmath139 qmc correspondence is kinematic in nature : since the definition of vschsb demands infinite volume , qmc condition , being its equivalent , reacts to avoid conflict with the presence of infrared cutoff",
    ".    however , if the mechanism of vschsb was known , it would be reasonable to expect that other properties of quark modes , those suggested by the mechanism , could be used to signal vschsb even in given finite volume .",
    "after all , broken and symmetric dynamics should be distinguishable in any volume .",
    "in fact , if infrared cutoff is smaller than relevant _ finite _ scales in the theory , the distinction from single volume should be essentially unambiguous .    while the mechanism of vschsb has not been satisfactorily clarified yet , one of the driving motivations for developing chiral polarization framework was to provide a possible indicator of the above type .",
    "it is important in that regard that , unlike @xmath112 , chiral polarization parameters @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be readily non  zero in finite volume . if forming chirally polarized layer around the surface of dirac sea provides sufficient and necessary condition for producing vschsb , as conjectures of the previous section propose , then chiral polarization characteristics represent viable candidates for such _ finite  volume `` order parameters '' _ indeed .",
    "it is interesting that the situation in finite volume is in fact simpler than what we dealt with in the previous section .",
    "there are just three characteristics which , taking into account the convention on exact zero  modes , can only be non ",

    "however , in addition to this and the fact that @xmath162 is expected to be a valid order parameter in traditional sense , our notion of finite  volume order parameter for vschsb involves another feature contained in the following statement consistent with available data .",

    ", vacuum correlations are probed by a pair of external ( valence ) massless quarks and the role of chiral symmetry breaking is assumed by its valence counterpart .",
    "examining the temperature effects in n@xmath4=0 qcd , and effects of many light flavors at @xmath250 ( for n@xmath4=12 ) , we find a complete agreement with this vschsb  chp correspondence .",
    "one relevant aspect of this connection , both practically and conceptually , is that it is perfectly well defined even at lattice ",
    "regularized level .",
    "indeed , if lattice fermions with exact chiral symmetry provide the massless probe , then vschsb has a full - fledged lattice representation .",
    "the associated conjectures can then be formulated directly for lattice theories , as done here , but with compliance only expected sufficiently close to the continuum limit .",
    "nevertheless , we found the agreement for every lattice system studied , even in corners where relevance for continuum physics hasnt yet been established , e.g. in the `` mixed phase '' of n@xmath251 qcd .",
    "it is thus conceivable that the connection is even more robust than originally expected .",
    "important motivation to identify the correspondence of vschsb  chp type is to narrow down options in searches for specific mechanism of the breaking phenomenon .",
    "indeed , the two aspects involved are not required to be locked together by general principles and are in fact quite different in nature .",
    "like that of any broken symmetry , the definition of vschsb is intimately tied to thermodynamic limit ( infinite volume ) . on the other hand , chp is defined in any fixed finite volume which is quite natural given its role to characterize and detect chiral symmetry breaking nature of the interaction at hand .",
    "indeed , such indicator is not expected to turn itself on in infinite volume only , but rather when volume is sufficiently large to contain relevant finite scales of the theory .    above considerations",
    "lead to the notion of _ finite  volume `` order parameter '' _ introduced in sec .",
    "[ ssec : finvol ] .",
    "this is intended to be a dynamical quantifier assuming non  zero value in sufficiently large _",
    "finite _ volumes if and only if the symmetry in question is broken ( in infinite volume ) .",
    "the width of chiral polarization layer ( @xmath1 ) , the volume density of total chirality ( @xmath3 ) , and the volume density of polarized modes ( @xmath2 ) , are viewed as prototypes of such objects associated with vschsb ( see _ conjectures 3,3_@xmath252 ) , and all available data is consistent with this proposition .",
    "in fact , we have not yet encountered a reversal of dynamical tendency for chiral polarization due to the volume being too small . in this vein , it is instructive to think of chiral polarization framework as an attempt to construct a `` predictor '' of valence chiral symmetry breaking for qcd  like theories .",
    "such predictor , say @xmath2 , will be most efficient if it is also a finite  volume order parameter . indeed , a well  founded wager on vschsb can then be made based on the value of @xmath2 in a single otherwise acceptable volume .    conceptual simplicity in the notion of finite  volume order parameter",
    "is further underlined by the fact that all three chp  based characteristics are ( non)zero simultaneously in finite volume .",
    "thus , although the state of chiral polarization is characterized by the triplet @xmath253 the associated vschsb inquiry in fact involves a single object , namely @xmath254 note that , as finite  volume order parameters , elements of chp@xmath255 are not required to have non  zero infinite ",
    "volume limits when symmetry is broken , but @xmath256 .",
    "if , contrary to initial evidence , the notion of finite  volume order parameter on @xmath257 does nt materialize , vschsb ",
    "chp correspondence can still be based on order parameters of more traditional variety : those indicating the symmetry breakdown by positive _ infinite  volume _ value .",
    "the situation becomes more structured though , since the classification of possible chp behaviors in infinite volume is given by the heptaplet of non  negative parameters @xmath258 with variety of mixed ",
    "positivity scenarios allowed in principle . in this language , the hypothetical lack of finite  volume order parameter implies that @xmath259 is not a good infinite  volume indicator of vschsb . nevertheless , in the vschsb ",
    "chp correspondence being constructed , @xmath260 still indicates symmetric vacuum since it implies vanishing of all elements in chp@xmath261 and thus absence of any polarized behavior .",
    "however , to formulate the equivalence , one needs to specify which forms of chp@xmath261 with @xmath262 are associated with vschsb .",
    "this heavily depends on the scope of polarized behaviors generated by theories in @xmath257 .    to this effect",
    ", we formulated three versions of such infinite  volume correspondence that are not mutually exclusive , but include an increasingly large variety of chiral polarization .",
    "the most restrictive form , _ conjecture 2 _ , assumes that no singular cases occur sufficiently close to the continuum limit  @xcite . here",
    "`` singular '' refers to any combination of the first six elements in chp@xmath261 with mixed positivity , or with paired characteristics not matching ( e.g. @xmath263 ) . in this case",
    ", each element of chp@xmath261 ( except @xmath259 ) is individually a valid infinite ",
    "volume order parameter of vschsb .",
    "such scenario was only found to be violated in the narrow mixed phase of n@xmath4=0 qcd , but complete agreement may hold closer to continuum limit , which is sufficient . in _",
    "conjecture 2 _ we minimally expanded the range of anticipated chp behaviors in order to include the singular option encountered above , namely @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "here @xmath3 , @xmath2 and their partners are each an infinite  volume order parameter of vschsb .",
    "most generally , _ conjecture 2  _ admits all singular chp behaviors , in which case @xmath2 becomes the sole reliable indicator of vschsb : the layer of chirally polarized modes is expected to be physically relevant only when total volume density of participating modes remains positive in the infinite  volume limit .",
    "we emphasize that having differently focused versions of vschsb  chp correspondence simply reflects differently aimed benefits of the underlying relationship . indeed , the more restrictive the form of correspondence turns out to be valid , the more information on the continuum behavior of vschsb it conveys . on the other hand ,",
    "the more generic the formulation becomes , the wider its applicability becomes in terms of cutoff theories . in an extreme case",
    ", the relationship might turn out to be as generic as the vschsb ",
    "qmc correspondence , i.e. valid at arbitrary non ",
    "zero cutoff .",
    "the analysis in this paper ( and the discussion above ) focuses attention to @xmath2 as a central characteristic of chp in relation to vschsb . indeed ,",
    "not only does @xmath2 provide for the simple and most generic way to express vschsb  chp correspondence , it is also expected to be a universal quantity characterizing qcd vacuum ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : universal ] ) .",
    "moreover , our numerical experiments show that the most practical scheme for detecting chiral polarization proceeds via computing the dependence of @xmath179 on @xmath49 , from which @xmath2 ( and @xmath3 ) is directly determined .    during the course of our main inquiry we encountered few results that are noteworthy in their own right .",
    "the first one relates to the issue of thermal mixed phase ( @xmath32 ) in n@xmath4=0 qcd , i.e. the existence of deconfined system in real polyakov line vacuum but with broken valence chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this is a well  posed and interesting question even at given cutoff , but its resolution requires a careful volume study .",
    "our data involves several volumes and the results indicate that the mixed phase with overlap valence quarks does indeed exist , at least for some range of cutoffs . the associated vschsb proceeds via band of spatially inhomogeneous and chirally polarized near ",
    "zeromodes , well separated from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "the width of the band appears to vanish in the infinite  volume limit , possibly involving @xmath143 singularity in spectral density .",
    "we found that a similar phase also exists in n@xmath4=12 theory at light quark mass , which deserves a dedicated study .    the last side result we wish to discuss suggests novel characterization of ( de)confinement . while at @xmath266 only convex or concave absolute @xmath77distributions of dirac modes",
    "are found in n@xmath4=0 qcd , the band of convex ",
    "indefinite modes appears at @xmath267 .",
    "thus , at least in this setting , the existence of such band seems to play the same role for deconfinement as the existence of chirally polarized band plays for vschsb .",
    "both layers are present in the mixed phase as they should .",
    "the situation at high temperatures brings up an interesting question , namely how does the `` concavity edge '' , marking the transition from convex  indefinite to concave behavior in dirac spectra at @xmath267 , relate to `` mobility edge '' feature discussed in refs .",
