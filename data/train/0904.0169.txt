    "one possible signal for the formation of the quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions is jet quenching .",
    "partons with a large transverse momentum are created from hard collisions between the partons of the nuclei involved in the initial heavy ion collision .",
    "these produced high @xmath1 partons will traverse the collision region ( possibly consisting of the quark - gluon plasma ) within the first few fm / c . depending upon the properties of the medium traversed",
    "the parton will lose energy resulting in an experimentally observed jet quenching .",
    "there have been numerous theoretical calculations of both collisional @xcite and radiative @xcite energy loss of partons in a qcd medium and it is seen that both effects play an important role @xcite in the transverse momentum region where rhic is most sensitive to jet quenching . even with these theoretical results at hand there is still no model which can explain the data @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the observed quenching at rhic energies is stronger then most theoretical predictions .",
    "it should be mentioned that most of the energy loss results were computed in a weak coupling expansion which one would expect to converge as long as @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is known from lattice results @xcite that at the relevant temperatures probed at rhic @xmath3 reaches values of @xmath4 and it should be checked how well the perturbative solution converges for the values of @xmath3 probed in these experiments .",
    "it is also known that the matter produced at rhic can not be weakly coupled but instead a good liquid .",
    "the evidence for the sqgp @xcite is large and growing but consists of the following two points : 1/ the observed collective flows at rhic can be explained by hydrodynamics showing that the dissipative lengths are very short 2/ binary bound states are seen to exist in lattice simulations above @xmath5 and are also predicted @xcite using lattice interparticle potentials .",
    "we should point out to the reader that there has been arguments against bound states as well @xcite .    since perturbative methods generally fail in explaining strongly coupled systems other approaches have to be adopted .",
    "for example , first principle calculations of the sqgp have been done using supersymmetric extensions of qcd via the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the approach taken here , as was first discussed in @xcite , is to model the strongly interacting quark and gluon quasiparticles as a classical non - relativistic colored coulomb gas .",
    "this model is analyzed using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in which real time correlators can be extracted . in @xcite decorrelation times , diffusion and viscosity",
    "was extracted for all phases .",
    "it was found that when the results were extrapolated to the sqgp a diffusion constant of @xmath6 and viscosity to entropy density ratio of @xmath7 was found . in @xcite charmonium evolution in the sqgp was studied in a related framework .    in this work",
    "we examine the energy loss of heavy quarks propagating through the sqgp . in section 2",
    "we shortly review the key ingredients of the cqgp .",
    "we show how the structure factor can be used to discriminate the gas , liquid and solid phases .",
    "we also show that the electric force decorrelates on a short time scale in the liquid and solid phase , meaning that color probes become rapidly diffusive in the cqgp . in section 3 ,",
    "we numerically assess the heavy quark diffusive properties and show that they are amenable to a generic langevin description . in the liquid phase , heavy quarks drag with a drag coefficient that is smaller the larger the heavy quark mass .",
    "the diffusion constant is independent of the heavy quark mass . in section 4 , the relative energy loss of heavy quarks for the gas , liquid and solid phases are assessed . in section 5 , we translate the cqgp results to the sqgp ones in the window of temperatures @xmath8 .",
    "our discussions and conclusions are in section 6",
    ". some useful units for comparison to the sqgp can be found in appendix a. a comparison of the energy loss with kinetic calculations is in appendix b.",
    "as mentioned in the introduction at temperatures close to @xmath9 quarks and gluons become quasiparticles with masses on the order of 3 t .",
    "we can model the sqgp as a system of massive non - relativistic particles interacting through longitudinal color electric fields .",
    "magnetic effects are suppressed in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the specific hamiltonian used in our model of the sqgp is    @xmath10 \\label{hh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath11    with @xmath12 being a sum over all particles of specie @xmath13= q , q , g having respective particle number @xmath14 .",
    "the first term in the above hamiltonian is the standard kinetic energy term .",
    "the second term is the colored coulomb interaction .",
    "again we have neglected any chromomagnetic interaction in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "non - perturbative effects due to magnetic charges are discussed in @xcite .",
    "a short range repulsive potential was added by hand and is needed to give stability to the simulation and can be argued to mimic the effect of a quantum localization energy .",
    "a more detailed study of the quantum corrections to potentials used in classical md simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion can be derived from the usual poisson brackets ( @xmath15 ) where @xmath16 is the phase space coordinate of either position ( @xmath17 ) , momentum ( @xmath18 ) or color ( @xmath19 ) of particle @xmath20 .",
    "the strength of the interparticle interaction is classified in the context of traditional electromagnetic plasmas , using the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 , the ratio of the potential to kinetic energy :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 are respectively the ion charge , the wigner - seitz radius @xmath24 and the temperature .",
    "one usually defines the weakly coupled or gas regime for @xmath25 , a liquid regime for @xmath26 and a strongly coupled or solid regime for for @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath32 characterizes the probability to find two distinct particles having a separation @xmath33 at a time t. one can see the that correlation among particles increases as one goes from the gas to liquid to glass phases .",
    "it turns out , as discussed in appendix a , that we expect the properties of the sqgp to be consistent with the cqgp having @xmath34 .",
    "the nature of the decorrelation times can be numerically investigated .",
    "the color electric forces decorrelate on a short time scale in comparison to the velocity decorrelation , meaning that color probes whether heavy or light are readily diffusive in the cqgp whether gas , liquid or solid .",
    "the electric force follows from ( [ hh ] ) as @xmath35 , and the decorrelation function    @xmath36    is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] for the gas , liquid and solid phase .",
    "the color electric force decorrelates rapidly in the gas and liquid phase , and more slowly in the ordered solid phase . in the liquid phase with @xmath37",
    "the decorrelation time is @xmath38 in simulation units .",
    "we translate these units to physical units in appendix a. in particular @xmath39 for the sqgp .    ]",
    "to analyze the evolution of jets in the cqgp at strong coupling , we will use molecular dynamics simulations ( see @xcite for more details ) of the cqgp by integrating the above equations of motion of 64 particles confined to a box with periodic boundary conditions and mirror cubes on all sides .",
    "when equilibration of the system is reached an external particle is added to the simulation with a given momentum and mass ( m ) greater than the quark and gluon quasiparticle mass ( m ) .",
    "the evolution of this _ probe _ particle is tracked throughout the evolution of the system and it phase space coordinates are recorded .",
    "this procedure is repeated until enough measurements have been made to make a statistically significant distribution of any phase space quantity . for a given momentum bin we use @xmath40 measurements .",
    "statistical errors are given by @xmath41 of the number of runs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] we show two examples of the evolution of the probe particle s momentum distribution function , f(p ) , as measured in the md simulation in the liquid phase with @xmath37 .",
    "the first shows the evolution for a heavy quark mass with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( large initial peak ) and the second for a heavy quark mass with @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( large initial peak ) .",
    "each figure shows the initial momentum distribution and the distribution at two later times . as the time of flight or distance increases a decrease in the average momentum of the probe as well as a broadening of the distribution function",
    "is seen .    since the color electric forces decorrelate promptly as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] , the massive jet enters rapidly a diffusive regime . assuming homogeneity in space , the diffusion is mostly in momentum space .",
    "this is amenable to a non - relativistic fokker - planck equation ( ornstein - uhlenbeck type ) whereby the lowest two moments , i.e. drag and diffusion , are dominant . restricting our analysis to the one - dimensional case for simplicity  @xcite    @xmath46 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial p^2}\\left[m_2(p ) f\\right ] \\label{eq : fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the lowest two moments @xmath47 and @xmath48 are related to the drag and diffusion constant respectively ,    @xmath49    these two moments can be measured directly in our md simulation .",
    "the first moment , @xmath47 , is related to the average momentum loss where @xmath50 is the drag coefficient and as is seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : dpdt ] is independent of p for initial momentum greater than the thermal momentum of the system . we therefore take @xmath51 ( in simulation units ) for the various cases of the heavy quark mass having @xmath52 respectively .",
    "noticeably , the drag coefficient @xmath50 decreases as the jet mass increases .",
    "the second moment , @xmath48 , is related to the longitudinal momentum fluctuations ( @xmath53 ) and is @xmath54 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpdt ] . within uncertainties",
    "@xmath53 is independent of the heavy probe mass and we take @xmath55 .    using the parameterizations of @xmath56 and @xmath53 defined above the evolution equation [ eq : fp ]",

    "[ fig : fp ] as solid curves . within the uncertainties of both",
    "the underlying model ( soft collisions , one - dimensional ) as well as our parameterization of transport coefficients the fokker - planck analysis shows good agreement with the md distributions .",
    "from the momentum distribution function we can evaluate the mean energy of the external parton after traversing a distance l as :    @xmath57    and define the fractional energy loss as :    @xmath58    in figure  [ fig : len ] we show the fractional energy loss as a function of length ( in simulation units ) for three different coupling parameters . in all cases",
    "the external particle has a mass ten times that of the quasiparticle mass ( _ i.e. _ @xmath59 in simulation units ) .",
    "for all three cases an approximately linear rise in energy loss as a function of length is seen which is expected for collisional loss only .",
    "we also show the fractional energy loss as a function of initial energy ( in simulation units ) for three different values of coupling parameters .",
    "as expected , at thermal energies , the fractional energy loss is _ negative _ because a particle with @xmath60 can only gain momentum in collisions .",
    "one sees that the fractional energy loss remains constant at high enough energies .",
    "the fact that the energy loss is proportional to @xmath61 at high enough energy instead of increasing logarithmically as in the case for coulomb collisions is due to the core potential ( eq .  [ eq : core ] ) . since the different coupling parameters @xmath21 are modified by changing the system temperature we do nt expect to see differences in the energy loss when the probe s momentum is much greater than the thermal momentum @xmath62 of the quasiparticles .",
    "in order to compare the results from the md simulation in the cqgp to the sqgp at rhic we follow the arguments of  @xcite as summarized in appendix a. specifically , we consider a plasma at a temperature @xmath63 mev@xmath64 corresponding to a coupling parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the unit of mass is rescaled using @xmath65=[3t]\\approx0.75 $ ] gev , so a heavy probe with mass 2 , 6 and 10 times the quasiparticle mass as used in the simulation corresponds to masses of 1.5 gev , 4.5 gev and 7.5 gev respectively in the sqgp . as mentioned earlier",
    "the plasma consists of quasiparticles with @xmath66 gev at @xmath67 .",
    "the drag coefficient has units @xmath68=[1/\\tau]=[5.1t]\\approx6.5 $ ] @xmath69 .",
    "assuming that the drag is independent of @xmath70 as we showed for a large range of momenta we find that @xmath71 @xmath69 for probe masses of @xmath72 gev respectively .",
    "it is also useful to look at the energy loss after the probe particle travels a finite length l ( here taken to be about the length of our simulation region or 4.5 simulation units ) which corresponds to @xmath73 fm in the sqgp . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eloss_avg_unit ] we show the fractional energy loss as a function of the probe particle s initial momentum as calculated from the md simulation ( points with error bars ) . for comparison",
    "we also show the leading order in @xmath3 collisional energy loss of the scattering of heavy quarks off of massless quarks and gluons @xcite . the sensitivity to the schematic form of the core potential is smaller at larger values of momentum .",
    "this is verified by a comparison of the md simulation results to analytic calculations preformed in @xcite .",
    "@xmath74    where the lower cutoff of the momentum transfer is taken as the debye mass : @xmath75 and the upper cutoff @xmath76 is taken from @xcite . in order to compare the above equation to our simulation results",
    "we take @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "first , it should be mentioned , that the energy loss in equation [ eq : dedx ] acts as an upper limit for other energy loss calculations as presented in @xcite . comparing the md simulation results to the leading order results in eq .",
    "[ eq : dedx ] one immediately sees a much larger fractional energy loss for the sqgp . as much as a factor of five in the high momentum region .",
    "the main physical differences that account for the large increase are : 1/ the use of quasiparticle quark and gluon masses ( @xmath79 ) much greater than the current quark masses 2/ the use of the hard core potential to _ mock up _ the effects of quantum repulsion at short distances .",
    "3/ any non - local many body interactions induced by the coulomb and core potential are resummed to all orders using md .",
    "one should note that if the current lattice results at @xmath80 are modified the same md simulation results can be used by simply applying a different rescaling of the units consistent with the data .",
    "since the fractional energy loss is mostly constant as a function of momentum , a rescaling of the momentum will not change the results in the high energy region . however , both the length of the medium and the mass of the heavy probe particle will need to be adjusted accordingly .",
    "the change in length unit will also modify the result for the drag coefficient .    in conclusion",
    "we have computed the parton energy loss in a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma using a classical molecular dynamic simulation .",
    "the model consists of massive strongly interacting quark and gluon quasiparticles at @xmath81 interacting as a classic non - relativistic colored coulomb gas .",
