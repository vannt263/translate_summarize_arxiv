    "spin foam models have been proposed as candidates for a quantum theory of gravity , see , for example , the review articles  @xcite . a spin foam  @xcite whose symmetry group is a suitable lie group @xmath3 , is an abstract oriented two - complex consisting of faces , edges and vertices , together with a colouring of the faces with representations of @xmath3 and a colouring of the edges with compatible intertwiners ( representation morphisms ) of @xmath3 .",
    "spin foam models are defined by a path integral in terms of a sum over spin foams , often over all colourings of a fixed two - complex or in addition over a class of two - complexes .",
    "the most carefully studied model in this context is the barrett  crane model  @xcite which was initially formulated for a riemannian signature and a local @xmath0-symmetry . a version with lorentzian signature and @xmath1-symmetry can be constructed along similar lines . here",
    "we are interested in the model  @xcite in which all tetrahedra are space - like ,  if the model is formulated on the two - complex dual to a triangulated four - manifold , then the model assigns a geometry to the two - complex such that each tetrahedron has a time - like normal vector .    the idea for the construction of the barrett",
    " crane model  @xcite can be sketched as follows .",
    "general relativity in four dimensions is reformulated as a topological @xmath4-theory with symmetry group @xmath0 or @xmath1 , depending on the signature , subject to bi - vector constraints which break the topological properties and which ensure that the theory is classically equivalent to general relativity , possibly allowing degenerate metrics .",
    "topological @xmath4-theory is then regularized and quantized on a triangulated four - manifold which results in a topological spin foam model .",
    "the bi - vector constraints are finally implemented into this quantum theory .",
    "the result is a spin foam model which dynamically assigns geometric data to a purely combinatorial triangulation .",
    "the path integral of the spin foam model can then be used in order to define the matrix elements of some operator between spin network states .",
    "there have been different conjectures , for example , that it is some unitary ` time evolution ' operator or that this operator is the projection from some kinematical hilbert space onto the physical hilbert space of quantum gravity .",
    "the precise role of the fourth direction ( ` time ' ? ) in this path integral , however , remained obscure .",
    "in particular it was observed  @xcite , see also  @xcite , that the amplitudes of this path integral are positive real so that it does not look like a complex oscillating ` real time ' path integral at all .",
    "formally , it could be an euclidean ( ` imaginary time ' ) path integral , but this was not the intention of the construction , and a physical interpretation of this picture is also lacking .",
    "recently , livine and oriti  @xcite proposed a modification of the amplitudes of the lorentzian barrett  crane model in which they employ , for each pair of triangle and four - simplex , only one out of two summands of the amplitude with a particular sign in the exponent .",
    "this guarantees that the construction is compatible with a causal structure imposed on the four - simplices and that the model resembles a ` real time ' feynman (  causal ) path integral of a quantum field theory with four - dimensional lorentzian regge action . in the following , we call this version of the model the _ causal",
    "_ lorentzian barrett  crane model .",
    "livine and oriti  @xcite derive consistency conditions on the relevant signs for the construction of this model .",
    "a causal version of the riemannian barrett  crane model can be defined by analogy .",
    "this , however , is not more than just a toy model because in this case the causal structure has to be imposed completely by hand and is no longer related to the signature of the metric .",
    "we do include this possibility in the following because it is occasionally very helpful for technical reasons .",
    "given the causal model with its definition of the feynman path integral , there are a number of natural questions to ask . what is the status of the measure ?",
    "are the integrals convergent , at least for a fixed triangulation and a fixed assignment of representations to the triangles ? having identified an action for the path integral , is there any coupling constant in the model which can affect the dominant contributions to the path integral ?",
    "is there a consistent ` wick rotation ' in order to render all amplitudes positive real and to obtain an ` imaginary time ' model whose physical interpretation we understand ?",
    "which numbers can we extract from the model ? in the present article , we address various aspects of these questions .    in particular , we give an explicit construction of suitable sign factors that satisfy the conditions of livine and oriti  @xcite .",
    "we rephrase the causal model so that it becomes manifest that a future - pointing increase in the lapse function of the path integral ( for details , see  @xcite ) corresponds to four - simplices with positive four - volume .",
    "we demonstrate how to split measure and @xmath5-amplitude so that all integrals originating from the @xmath2-symbols are well defined , and we introduce a dimensionless coupling constant into the model .",
    "as far as the wick rotation is concerned , we follow ideas from the area of dynamical triangulations  @xcite and proceed four - simplex by four - simplex , introducing @xmath6 or @xmath7 into the exponents in order to obtain an euclidean action , depending on whether the simplex itself or its opposite oriented counterpart appears in the feynman propagator .",
    "it should be pointed out that the relation of this euclidean theory with the original one does not yet have the status of a theorem comparable to the situation in axiomatic quantum field theory .",
    "what is the status of wick rotation in quantum gravity in general ? in a path integral of quantum gravity one has to sum , in one way or another , over all possible four - metrics most of which do not admit any global time coordinate which one could use in order to wick rotate a lorentzian to a riemannian manifold .",
    "in addition , the choice of a time coordinate is obviously not a diffeomorphism invariant concept .",
    "these problems render wick rotation in a generic quantum gravity setting highly questionable .",
    "why then discuss wick rotation at all ?",
    "the answer is that one should not take wick rotation literally and not try to substitute @xmath8 for some coordinate @xmath9 .",
    "rather , there exists a generalization  @xcite of the osterwalder ",
    "schrader euclidean reconstruction theorem to background independent theories which relates a path integral theory which is defined on a four manifold of the topology @xmath10 and whose measure is reflection positive , with a canonical quantum theory in terms of hilbert space and hamiltonian on @xmath11 . in a spin foam context",
    ", such a procedure will be independent of the metric signature because the local frame symmetry is treated as an internal symmetry in the underlying first order formulation of general relativity .",
    "we therefore expect that we can independently euclideanize both the riemannian and the lorentzian signature models and that their signatures and symmetry groups do not change under such a transformation .    since up to now",
    ", there does not exist any generally accepted way of achieving independence of the barrett  crane model from the chosen triangulation , we can not restore the full diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "therefore we can not yet verify all of the generalized osterwalder  schrader axioms  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for searching an euclidean version of the causal model is the fact that the resulting model with its positive real amplitudes can be tackled by standard simulation algorithms .",
    "we call the resulting ` wick rotated ' model the _ euclidean _ ( riemannian or lorentzian ) barrett  crane model .",
    "note that the term _ euclidean _ refers to the use of ` imaginary time ' as opposed to the term _ riemannian _ which denotes the metric signature    in the resulting euclidean model , one wishes to calculate interesting quantities .",
    "we address the question of which are suitable observables ( here meaning numbers we can extract from the model on a fixed two - complex ) in the _ connection picture _ , the reformulation which uses continuous variables and which was developed for the riemannian model in  @xcite and calculate the most general function of the connection variables that is compatible with the local symmetries of the model .",
    "finally , starting from the analysis of the local symmetries , we show how both the causal and the euclidean model can still be re - expressed in terms of relativistic @xmath2-symbols which are familiar from the original model .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in section  [ sect_notation ]",
    ", we introduce our notation for oriented two - complexes and introduce the riemannian and lorentzian barrett ",
    "crane models in their original formulation . in section  [ sect_measure ]",
    ", we review the causal versions of these models , present a construction of all required signs , carefully choose an appropriate measure and identify a dimensionless coupling constant . the transition amplitudes are euclideanized in section  [ sect_wick ] .",
    "we study in section  [ sect_observe ] the most general observables of the model in the connection picture . in section  [ sect_back ] ,",
    "we show how the causal and the euclidean models can be rephrased in terms of the relativistic @xmath2-symbols , similar to the original formulation of the model .",
    "section  [ sect_conclusion ] contains some concluding comments .",
    "we consider the triangulation of an oriented piecewise linear four - manifold @xmath12 and its dual two - complex .",
    "this two - complex is described by sets @xmath13 of vertices , @xmath14 of edges and @xmath15 of faces together with maps indicating the source @xmath16 and target @xmath17 of each edge @xmath18 as well as all edges @xmath19 in the boundary of each face @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 enumerates all these edges .",
    "as far as the orientations are concerned , we write @xmath22 depending on whether the four - simplex dual to @xmath23 is isomorphic to a simplex in @xmath12 or whether this is true for its counterpart with opposite orientation , denoted by @xmath24 . for each @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath18 , we write @xmath25 for the orientation of the tetrahedron dual to @xmath26 in the boundary of the four - simplex dual to @xmath27 .    in the interior of @xmath12 , each tetrahedron is contained in the boundary of exactly two four - simplices so that it appears once with either orientation .",
    "therefore @xmath28 where the tetrahedron dual to @xmath18 is contained in the boundary of the two four - simplices dual to @xmath29 .",
    "finally , we write @xmath30 for the orientation of the triangle ( dual to the face ) @xmath20 in the boundary of the tetrahedron ( dual to the edge ) @xmath18 .    in our formulas , we always use the notation of the two - complex @xmath31 .",
    "if we mean the two - complex dual to a triangulation , we often omit the words ` dual to ' and speak of the four - simplex @xmath23 , the tetrahedron @xmath18 , . as the motivation of the causal barrett ",

    "] is @xmath1 in the version in which all tetrahedra are space - like  @xcite , is defined in complete analogy by the partition function , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denotes the relative rapidity ( hyperbolic distance ) of @xmath56 . here",
    "we denote by @xmath57 three - dimensional hyperbolic space , written as the set of future pointing time - like unit vectors in minkowski space @xmath58 whose standard scalar product @xmath59 is diagonal with entries @xmath60 .",
    "note that we are following the conventions of  @xcite here .",
    "it should be mentioned that the integrals over @xmath61 in   converge only after division by an infinite volume factor  @xcite .",
    "we keep this fact in mind , but leave our formulas unchanged in order to preserve their full symmetry .",
    "livine and oriti  @xcite have proposed a modification of the lorentzian model   in which one writes the sine in the numerator of each factor @xmath62 as a sum of two exponentials and keeps only one of the exponentials , discarding the other . what matters is the sign that appears in the exponent .",
    "the authors derive consistency conditions under which one can make this choice for the entire triangulation so that one obtains a total amplitude @xmath5 in the integrand in which @xmath63 is related to the four - dimensional lorentzian regge action . in this section , we present a full construction of the relevant signs .",
    "we use the notation introduced in section  [ sect_triang ] and observe that the condition  ( 85 ) of  @xcite coincides with our equation  .    in order to interpret the model   geometrically as in  @xcite",
    ", we wish to associate two future pointing time - like vectors @xmath64 to each tetrahedron .",
    "the only question is what future pointing means for a purely combinatorial triangulation .",
    "there is some additional information required , namely a partial order ` @xmath65 ' on the set @xmath13 of four - simplices such that the relation is at least defined for each pair of four - simplices that share a tetrahedron in their boundary . without loss of generality , we can then put only tetrahedra @xmath26 into the set @xmath14 for which @xmath66 .",
    "otherwise we rather include @xmath67 in the set @xmath14 and adapt the @xmath68-factors of section  [ sect_triang ] accordingly .",
    "observe that if we had triangulated an oriented lorentzian four - manifold with only space - like tetrahedra , we could have derived the partial order ` @xmath65 ' from the causal structure of the metric ,  ` @xmath65 ' means ` is in the causal future of ' , and the above construction would precisely result in future pointing time - like normal vectors .    the choice of signs in  @xcite is based on the lorentzian regge action in four dimensions . therefore one has to calculate the ` dihedral rapidities ' ( generalized defect angles ) for all pairs of neighbouring tetrahedra @xmath69 that cobound a given triangle @xmath20 .",
    "neighbouring here means that both tetrahedra are contained in the boundary of the same four - simplex @xmath23 .",
    "the outward normals are then given by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and we also define normals @xmath72 which go clockwise ` around the triangle @xmath73 ' . these are used in order to calculate the lorentzian analogue of the defect angle .",
    "recall that all triangles are space - like .    depending on the shape of the four - simplex @xmath27 , we are either in the _ thin wedge _ situation ( see  @xcite for the analogous three - dimensional case )",
    ", in which the rapidity relevant for the action corresponds to an interior angle , @xmath74 or else in the _ thick wedge _ situation in which it corresponds to an exterior one , @xmath75 as all @xmath76 are future pointing , we are in the thin wedge case if and only if @xmath77 it can thus be shown that the relevant rapidity is always @xmath78 the contribution to the lorentzian regge action from a given triangle @xmath20 is therefore , @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the area of the triangle @xmath20 and the set @xmath81 contains all four - simplices in whose boundary the triangle @xmath73 occurs , so that the sum is over all pairs of tetrahedra @xmath82 , @xmath36 that share the triangle @xmath73 and that are contained in the boundary of the same four - simplex @xmath23",
    ".    while the regge action @xmath83 for any single triangle is of the form  , each triangle can contribute with a different total sign @xmath84 so that the overall action is rather , @xmath85 where we have also introduced a dimensionless ` coupling ' constant @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath87 are not independent though .",
    "there exist relations for each four - simplex from stokes theorem for the oriented normal vectors to the tetrahedra in its boundary which can be evaluated differentially using the lorentzian version of the schlfli identities  @xcite . for each four - simplex @xmath23 and two tetrahedra @xmath69 sharing a common triangle @xmath20",
    ", the condition is @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes an unspecified sign for each four - simplex .",
    "this condition was given in  @xcite writing @xmath90 .",

    "it is , however , also possible to keep the orientations of the four - simplices as they are and to choose @xmath93 .",
    "as we will see below , a four - simplex with @xmath94 is then interpreted as a future - pointing contribution to the causal path integral .    according to  @xcite , the causal lorentzian barrett",
    " crane model is defined by replacing @xmath95 in   by , @xmath96 depending on the triangle @xmath20 and the four - simplex @xmath23 .",
    "this expression leads precisely to the lorentzian regge action   in the exponent . in order to see this ,",
    "combine   with  .",
    "we remind the reader that we are following the conventions of  @xcite which differ from those employed in  @xcite . by analogy with the lorentzian model",
    ", we also define a causal riemannian barrett  crane model replacing @xmath97 in   by , @xmath98      recall that the integrals over @xmath61 in the original version of the lorentzian model   had to be regularized  @xcite , exploiting the @xmath1-invariance of the @xmath2-symbol and dividing by an infinite volume factor , in order to obtain absolutely convergent integrals .",
    "it can be seen from   that the same procedure will not suffice in order to define the corresponding integrals of the causal model because the overall numerator is of modulus one while the denominator goes to zero linearly as @xmath99 so that these integrals will diverge .",
    "therefore the four - simplex amplitudes can not even be defined for a given assignment of representations @xmath100 to the faces .",
    "this situation is different in nature from the expected divergence of the partition function which is already familiar from the ponzano ",
    "regge model in three dimensions , which originates just from the summation over infinitely many representations and which can be understood as an infrared divergence  @xcite .",
    "in order to proceed , we therefore have to modify   and   in a suitable way .",
    "let us consider the riemannian case first .",
    "the first observation is that there is some freedom in the splitting performed in  @xcite into one factor which is associated with the overall measure , here the denominator @xmath101 , and another factor , here the numerator @xmath102 , which is interpreted as the amplitude @xmath103 .",
    "the splitting was only motivated by the analogy with the lower dimensional cases , as outlined , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "the key condition is that the amplitude factor can be written as the sum of two complex conjugate terms of modulus one .",
    "there exists , for example , the following alternative splitting which leads to a bounded measure part and still satisfies the required condition on the amplitude part , @xmath104 the cosine of the amplitude part can then still be written as @xmath105 .",
    "we observe that the numerator of the measure part goes to zero linearly as @xmath106 canceling the divergence and at the same time we get the expression @xmath107 in the exponent of the amplitude part which uses the area eigenvalue @xmath108 of  @xcite . at this point",
    "the riemannian model is very helpful because this area eigenvalue directly motivates the choice of  .",
    "the new definitions which replace the causal amplitudes   and   are therefore , @xmath109 and by analogy the lorentzian case , @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are defined as in   and  .    in the riemannian case ,",
    "the integrals over the @xmath113 converge because all @xmath114 are bounded and integrated over a compact manifold @xmath115 . in the lorentzian case",
    ", we notice that @xmath116 so that the proof of convergence of the integrals of @xmath95 over the @xmath64 which was presented in  @xcite , implies the existence of our integrals of the @xmath117 over the @xmath64 .",
    "we can use the same regularization procedure .      in our notation",
    ", we can simplify   and   as follows , @xmath118 so that the exponents depend only on one sign @xmath119 per four - simplex .",
    "this links the orientation of four - simplices with the amplitudes of the causal model .",
    "therefore we can write the partition function of the causal lorentzian barrett  crane model as , @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the regge action in the variables of the lorentzian model in which the areas of the triangles @xmath20 are given by the @xmath122 . observe that the prefactors @xmath123 of   cancel in the product over all vertices and all faces attached to the vertices .",
    "the causal riemannian model is given by , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the regge action in terms of the variables of the riemannian model in which the triangle areas are given by @xmath126 .",
    "in both cases , the amplitudes of the causal model lead to the regge action for the special value @xmath127 which in turn indicates that there could have been be a free parameter @xmath86 in the barrett  crane model right from the beginning .",
    "this observation suggests the following generalization of the original amplitudes   and   to @xmath128 and of the causal amplitudes   and   to @xmath129 observe that we have inserted the coupling constant @xmath86 only into the amplitude part , but not into the measure part ,  .",
    "once one has accepted the idea for the construction of the causal model , some splitting such as   is necessary in order to make the integrals over @xmath61 or @xmath49 convergent .",
    "the constant @xmath86 parametrizes in some sense the non - uniqueness of such a splitting .",
    "notice that the original model for @xmath130 no longer satisfies the bi - vector constraints of  @xcite nor does the causal model satisfy them .    at this point ,",
    "the various models diverge from each other , and the important question is what the physical relevance of the splitting   and of the constant @xmath86 is . in the following sections , we provide some tools in order to study these questions .",
    "these are first the definition of an euclidean version of the causal model in order to apply numerical simulations and second the study of the symmetries and the most general observables of these models .",
    "as far as the significance of the constant @xmath86 is concerned , there seem to prevail two opposite philosophies among the experts . if a classical limit can be obtained by studying the large spin ( or semi - classical ) limit for a single four - simplex , the appearance of @xmath86 is unlikely to have much impact .",
    "if , however , the four - simplices are too strongly coupled and the classical limit requires a non - perturbative renormalization by ` block - spin ' or coarse graining transformations in the spirit of statistical mechanics , then the new parameter @xmath86 can easily influence the results , even in the original barrett  crane model . for numerical results in the original model , see  @xcite . even the fact that the original barrett  crane model with @xmath131 does not satisfy the bi - vector constraints anymore , would not necessarily be fatal .",
    "if @xmath86 happens to control the renormalization scale , it is conceivable that the constraints are satisfied only approximately at an effective coarse grained scale .",
    "it was already observed in  @xcite that the variables of the path integral , independent areas @xmath100 or @xmath132 and directions @xmath133 or @xmath49 , indicate that the regge actions   and   have to be understood as actions in a first order formalism  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the regge action appears only in the intermediate stage of the duality transformation  @xcite in which both types of variables are present .",
    "the necessary constraint  @xcite that the variation of the angles is only over dihedral angles that correspond to actual four - simplex geometries , has been automatically implemented in the construction of the causal model , see section  [ sect_construct ] or  @xcite .",
    "in both partition functions   and  , the regge action takes its simplest form ,  with the least number of explicit signs , if one sums over all four - simplices only in the last step .",
    "if one interprets each four - simplex with @xmath94 as a future - pointing contribution to the causal path integral ,  obtained after integrating only over positive lapse , for details see  @xcite , there is an obvious candidate for an euclidean model by a suitable modification of the amplitudes .",
    "this can be done four - simplex by four - simplex .",
    "if we substitute @xmath134 into all exponents , we turn the oscillations into an exponential damping and arrive at the following proposal for an euclidean lorentzian barrett  crane model , @xmath135 where @xmath136 this means that we have replaced @xmath137 by @xmath138 similarly for riemannian signature , @xmath139 where @xmath140  we have replaced @xmath141 by @xmath142 we note that @xmath143 and @xmath144 for any @xmath145 .",
    "unfortunately , the euclidean reconstruction  @xcite does not provide a recipe of how to derive the _ euclidean action _",
    ", how to choose the four - dimensional path integral measure . in a fixed background with a distinguished @xmath9-coordinate ,",
    "one is usually guided by the heuristic substitution @xmath8 which typically changes some signs in the action wherever there are time derivatives involved ,  in the kinetic energy part . with the special ` time ' coordinate used in three - dimensional lorentzian dynamical triangulations , there is still a similar substitution one can use in order to construct the euclidean action  @xcite .",
    "the substitution used in those models essentially distinguishes space - like from time - like simplices and introduces a relative sign .    in the case of spin foam models",
    ", we do not have such a ` time ' coordinate at hand .",
    "however , since in the lorentzian case all triangles are space - like and therefore treated on equal footing , we expect that no relative signs enter the euclidean action .",
    "as long as we capture the relevant local symmetries , one can expect that euclidean reconstruction will lead to the correct canonical theory by universality arguments .",
    "we observe that if we fix all representations associated to the faces to the same representation , we get regular flat simplices so that we are in a situation very similar to a single configuration in a dynamical triangulation model  @xcite .",
    "the main difference to the dynamical triangulation models is that in those models all simplices have the same geometry , in particular the same size , and that all dynamical properties of the geometry are encoded in the sum over triangulations . in the case of the barrett ",
    "crane models , we have the additional complication that the geometry of the individual simplices is determined by the assignment of representations @xmath132 or @xmath100 to the triangles . therefore , the individual simplices can already be arbitrarily large .",
    "we also stress that the formulas   and   refer to a two - complex with a causal structure imposed on the vertices .",
    "this excludes in particular space - times with closed time - like curves .",
    "even stronger , if we have euclidean reconstruction following  @xcite in mind , we can not yet deal with topology change and have to require a global space - time topology of @xmath10 .    in the following section , we study expectation values of the continuous variables of the barrett  crane models . with these definitions , one can easily establish a dictionary in order to compare our constructions with the generalized euclidean reconstruction of  @xcite . note that the euclidean measure of  @xcite includes the integration measures , the factors which we have called the _ measure part _ and also what we have called the _",
    "amplitude part_. on very regular triangulations , it is possible to check under which conditions the euclidean path integral measure of the barrett  crane model is reflection positive ( this refers to what is called _ link reflection positive _ by lattice gauge theorists ) .",
    "this condition is satisfied provided that the edge and face amplitudes are real ,  if they do not change when one dualizes all representations involved .",
    "in this section , we consider all barrett  crane models mentioned so far as path integrals over the continuous connection variables @xmath146 or @xmath61 .",
    "this point of view has already been adopted in  @xcite for the riemannian model where we have shown that one can perform the sums over the representations @xmath147 as soon as the edge amplitudes are sufficiently simple .",
    "this point of view is also more closely related to the euclidean reconstruction  @xcite than is the usual picture in which the variables of the path integral are the representations attached to the triangles . in the following ,",
    "we therefore consider the @xmath148 as the variables of the path integral while the rest of the partition function , including the sums over the @xmath132 or the integrals over the @xmath100 , belongs to the amplitudes .",
    "all the versions of the riemannian signature model , the original one  , the causal   and the euclidean one  , are invariant under the following local @xmath0 ( or @xmath47 ) symmetry  @xcite , @xmath149 where @xmath150 , for all @xmath23 , defines a generating function of this local gauge transformation . we have identified @xmath41 , and",
    "the products in   are in @xmath38 .",
    "the independence follows from the invariance of the scalar product @xmath59 in @xmath44 in the definition of @xmath151 ,  .",
    "the lorentzian counterpart of this local symmetry is given by , @xmath152 where @xmath153 for each @xmath23 , and the dot denotes the action of @xmath1 on minkowski space @xmath58 .",

    "then the spin network function , @xmath161,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is invariant under the local symmetry  .",
    "the @xmath162 are the representation functions of @xmath163 and we follow the conventions of  @xcite .",
    "any @xmath164-function of the @xmath155 that is invariant under the local symmetry , is a square summable series over spin network functions of the form  .",
    "for the lorentzian case , let @xmath165 , @xmath166 , denote a simple irreducible representation of @xmath1 for each edge @xmath167 .",
    "the vectors of these representation spaces can be modeled by functions @xmath168 , see  @xcite for details . employing the gelfand  graev transform , an orthonormal basis for @xmath169",
    "is given by the functions , @xmath170 where @xmath171 denotes the two - sphere of future - pointing light - like vectors whose spatial component are unit vectors , and the integral is performed using the normalized lebesgue measure of @xmath171 .",
    "the indices of the spherical harmonics @xmath172 are in the range @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "let furthermore @xmath175 denote ( an arbitrary ) @xmath1-intertwiner for each vertex @xmath176 , given in terms of the coefficients , @xmath177 with respect to the above basis .",
    "then the spin network function @xmath178,\\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is invariant under the local symmetry  .",
    "all @xmath164-functions of the @xmath155 that are invariant under this local symmetry , are plancherel integrals over spin network functions of the form  .",
    "there will , however , arise convergence issues similar to those studied in  @xcite .",
    "if one views the partition function of the barrett  crane model as a path integral over the continuous variables @xmath155 , the numbers one can extract from the model are precisely the expectation values of spin network functions of the form   or  , respectively . in the riemannian case , these expectation values read @xmath179 for spin network functions @xmath180 of the form  . here the symbol @xmath181 in @xmath182 and @xmath183 stands for ` original ' , ` causal ' or ` euclidean ' , respectively .    in the lorentzian case , the analogous expectation value reads @xmath184 the euclidean reconstruction  @xcite relies on this type of expectation values in the construction of the physical hilbert space .    the expressions   and   can be reformulated in the language of a path integral whose variables are representations assigned to the faces and in which the integrals over the @xmath155 are performed , resulting in relativistic @xmath2-symbols as the vertex amplitudes .",
    "we call this formulation in which the representations @xmath132 or @xmath100 are the variables of the path integral , the _ representation picture _ as opposed to the _ connection picture _ in which the continuous variables @xmath155 are the variables of the path integral .",
    "the transformation from one to the other picture proceeds in complete analogy to the calculation for the partition function presented in  @xcite .",
    "we can therefore re - express the expectation values   and   in the representation picture . in the case of the original models   and   with @xmath127 , the result takes the simplest form . if , say in the riemannian version , the spin network function @xmath180 is supported only on edges in the boundary of the two - complex , the expectation value @xmath185 agrees with a matrix element of spin network states .",
    "this means it is calculated by summing over all spin foams of the barrett ",
    "crane model living on the given two - complex , but with additional faces and edges added so that these faces and edges are coloured by the same representations and intertwiners @xmath186 as those that characterize the spin network function @xmath180 .",
    "these expressions are the desired matrix elements between spin network states .",
    "a completely analogous result holds for the original lorentzian model .",
    "observe that the expectation values   and   are more general than just such matrix elements of spin network states .",
    "first , we have shown that the intertwiners @xmath187 and @xmath188 can be generic @xmath0 or @xmath1-intertwiners and are not restricted to the special barrett ",
    "crane intertwiners .",
    "the standard conjecture seems to be that for pure gravity , it is sufficient to employ _ relativistic _ spin networks ,  spin networks whose representations are simple and whose intertwiners are the barrett  crane intertwiner .",
    "if this happens to be true , then our calculation above parametrizes the most generic way of coupling other fields to pure gravity .",
    "this will be of relevance when one studies the coupling of matter to the barrett  crane model .",
    "indeed the choice of intertwiners   and   is the first occasion where the difference of @xmath0 or @xmath1 versus @xmath47 or @xmath189 matters .",
    "the second aspect in which the expectation values   and   are more general than matrix elements of spin network states , is the fact that they are not restricted to the boundary of the four - manifold .",
    "this can be seen as an analogy to the wilson loop in lattice gauge theory which is used to determine the static potential between a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this loop is not only supported on the space - like boundary of the four manifold , but it extends in time direction in the interior .",
    "this construction serves as a simplified version of a matter coupling which captures only the colour properties of the matter field but which neglects its dynamics .",
    "similar constructions may also prove useful in the study of spin foam models of quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , a generic wilson loop in the connection variables will give access to the curvature of the full @xmath0 or @xmath1-connection and therefore to dynamical properties and not just to its restriction to a space - like boundary .",
    "finally , we stress that the study of expectation values such as @xmath185 and @xmath190 is a convenient way of sidestepping the often tedious technicalities when one deals with boundary terms .",
    "the expectation values @xmath185 and @xmath190 become more complicated than what we have discussed so far , as soon as we consider the causal or the euclidean model or @xmath130 in the original model . recall that in the original partition function  , the integrations over the @xmath61 together with the product of @xmath62 form the relativistic @xmath2-symbols ( up to the regularization mentioned above ) .",
    "as soon as we replace the @xmath62 by  , or  , we no longer have a model whose four - simplex amplitudes are the relativistic @xmath2-symbols . in the original model for @xmath127",
    ", we were able to ` solve ' the integrations over the @xmath61 and knew that the result of the integration had an abstract definition as a relativistic @xmath2-symbol .",
    "after the modification of the integrands @xmath191 , there is no obvious analogy available .    in the following",
    "we show how the local symmetry of section  [ sect_local ] can be exploited in order to expand the modified integrand , a product of factors @xmath191 , into a series of ordinary relativistic @xmath2-symbols .",
    "the novel feature is that this step requires an additional colouring of the _ wedges _ ( the intersection of a face of the two - complex dual to the triangulation with a four - simplex of the original triangulation ) with simple representations of the symmetry group .",
    "consider first the riemannian case .",
    "the functions @xmath192 where @xmath181 stands for ` original ' , ` causal ' or ` euclidean ' , are @xmath164-functions @xmath193 . since they depend only on @xmath194 , where @xmath195 denote the corresponding elements of @xmath163 , they are class functions on @xmath38 and can be character expanded into a square summable series , @xmath196 where we write @xmath197 in order to indicate that @xmath198 is a function of @xmath199 .    with this expansion performed for each triangle @xmath20 and all four - simplices @xmath200 that contain the triangle @xmath73 in their boundary , we can apply the techniques of  @xcite and obtain , @xmath201.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression looks more complicated than it actually is .",
    "we can explain it in words as follows .",
    "there are two types of summations over representations .",
    "these are first the sum over all colourings of the triangles @xmath20 with simple representations @xmath202 of @xmath0 , and second the sum over all colourings of the wedges @xmath203 with representations @xmath204 . here the wedges are denoted by specifying a dual face @xmath20 and a four - simplex @xmath205 whose intersection forms the wedge .",
    "in addition to the face and edge amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath52 already present in the original model  , there is now an additional amplitude @xmath206 for each wedge , namely a character expansion coefficient of  . for the causal model",
    ", this amplitude will in general be complex .",
    "the amplitude for each four - simplex @xmath23 is given by the expression inside the square brackets in  .",
    "it is given by the usual relativistic @xmath2-symbol with a piece of the spin network @xmath207 inserted ( figure  [ fig_10j ] ) .",
    "the various summations contract the indices of the barrett ",
    "crane intertwiners which are denoted by @xmath208 using the conventions of  @xcite . here",
    "the sets @xmath209 contain all triangles @xmath73 that are contained in the boundary of the tetrahedron @xmath18 with orientation @xmath210 .",
    "if the intertwiner @xmath211 of the spin network @xmath207 is a barrett  crane intertwiner , this amplitude is an evaluated relativistic spin network and therefore non - negative real . for the riemannian case , this",
    "was shown in  @xcite whereas for the lorentzian analogue , this is a plausible conjecture  @xcite .",
    "observe that the representations @xmath132 attached to the triangles appear only in the expressions for the character expansion coefficients @xmath206 .",
    "the representations for which the @xmath2-symbols are evaluated , are no longer the @xmath132 , but rather the representations @xmath212 associated with the wedges @xmath203 .",
    "equation   illustrates the impact that the choice of the causal or euclidean amplitudes has on the structure and on the symmetries of the model .",
    "the central new feature is the additional colouring of the wedges with representations . only for the original barrett  crane model with @xmath127 ,",
    "there exists a significant simplification because in this case @xmath50 is already an @xmath38-character .",
    "this implies that @xmath213 so that all wedges @xmath203 of a given dual face @xmath20 are assigned the same representation @xmath214 . in this special case , equation   reduces to the original barrett  crane model  @xcite with a spin network @xmath207 inserted into its @xmath2-symbols .",
    "is there a lorentzian counterpart of the decomposition  ? in order to derive that formula",
    "we have made use of the identification @xmath41 which does not have an immediate analogue in the lorentzian case .",
    "let us reformulate the argument so that we can generalize it .",
    "the functions @xmath192 all have the symmetry @xmath215 for all @xmath216 and @xmath217 acting on @xmath49 ( section  [ sect_local ] ) . due to this symmetry ,",
    "the function is already specified if we know its values @xmath218 where @xmath219 denotes the north pole .",
    "if we write the function @xmath220 as a function on @xmath0 which is constant on the left - cosets @xmath221 where @xmath222 and @xmath223 , the invariance condition   implies that @xmath73 is also constant on the right - cosets @xmath224 and therefore a _ zonal spherical function_. these functions are precisely the characters of @xmath38 using the identification @xmath41 employed above .",
    "a generalization of   to the lorentzian case is now available since we know that the zonal spherical functions for the quotient @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , are precisely the functions @xmath228 ( see  ) .",
    "therefore we obtain the result that any @xmath164-function @xmath229 which satisfies @xmath230 for all @xmath231 and @xmath232 , is a plancherel integral of the form @xmath233 for a suitable function @xmath234 .",
    "therefore the strategy which has lead to  , can be directly applied to the lorentzian case .",
    "we do not repeat the analogue of   here as the required substitutions are now obvious : replace the sums over half - integers by integrals @xmath235 and make use of the integral presentation of the barrett ",
    "crane intertwiners @xmath236 .",
    "the analogues of the comments listed below equation   also apply to the lorentzian case .      in",
    "@xcite we have developed the quantum geometry of the barrett ",
    "crane model in the connection picture .",
    "this includes in particular the interpretation of the integrals over @xmath49 or @xmath61 that appear in the barrett ",
    "crane intertwiner , as integrals over possible directions of the vectors normal to the tetrahedra .",
    "the fact that there are two such variables for each tetrahedron was interpreted as the consequence of a non - trivial parallel transport which is associated with each tetrahedron and which maps the first normal to the second one .",
    "this parallel transport , however , is not a full @xmath0- or @xmath156-parallel transport , but it is rather specified only up to elements of the stabilizer which leave the first normal vector fixed .",
    "it was then possible to express what is the difference between @xmath4-theory and the barrett  crane model .",
    "it is precisely this averaging over the stabilizers . for more details , see  @xcite .",
    "the geometric interpretation was developed originally for riemannian signature , see section  4.2 of  @xcite .",
    "these results can be easily translated to lorentzian signature by the replacement of @xmath237 by @xmath238 .",
    "the comparison of the barrett ",
    "crane model with @xmath4-theory in section  4.3 of  @xcite relies on lemma  4.4 therein whose generalization we sketch in the following .",
    "let @xmath239 denote a representative function of @xmath156 in a representation of type @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , of the principal series .",
    "we realize the representation @xmath240 as a suitable space of sections of a line bundle @xmath243 and obtain an orthonormal basis from the spherical functions on the total space @xmath49 so that the range of the indices of the representative functions is given by @xmath244 and @xmath245 for @xmath246 .",
    "it is then possible to show that @xmath247 here @xmath248 is embedded as the stabilizer of @xmath249 , and the functions @xmath250 form an orthonormal basis of functions @xmath168 , see  .",
    "this shows that there exists an @xmath38-invariant subspace of @xmath240 only if the representation is simple , @xmath251 , and that this subspace is one - dimensional .",
    "we therefore obtain basis functions on @xmath252 from representative functions of @xmath156 by averaging over the right @xmath38-action .",
    "now we consider two points @xmath231 . for each @xmath253 , there exists some boost @xmath254 such that @xmath255 .",
    "the group elements @xmath232 that map @xmath256 are of the form @xmath257 where @xmath258 . however , if @xmath259 , then @xmath260 and conversely , therefore @xmath261 for some @xmath262 .",
    "we use this parametrization of @xmath263 and average over the stabilizer , @xmath264 the construction of  @xcite then says that for any holonomy @xmath265 at an edge , it matters only how @xmath263 acts on @xmath61 .",
    "therefore we choose some @xmath266 , calculate @xmath267 and average over the stabilizer ambiguity .",
    "the integration over the group which is present in the path integral then results in the desired integrations over @xmath61 .",
    "this is the lorentzian analogue of lemma  4.4 of  @xcite .",
    "what we have explained in sections  [ sect_wick ] and  [ sect_observe ] , the euclidean reconstruction and the analysis of the degrees of freedom of the barrett  crane model from an understanding of its local symmetries , is only one motivation for studying the observables in the connection picture .",
    "another motivation arises from the observation  @xcite that for some edge amplitudes , the partition function in the connection picture is particularly simple and resembles a spin model ( just ` spin ' , not ` spin foam ' ) with variables in @xmath49 or @xmath61 with local interaction terms at the faces .",
    "in particular , no evaluations of @xmath2-symbols are necessary in this case which makes numerical simulations computationally cheaper .",
    "one has just to tabulate the interaction terms .    for the original riemannian model",
    "it was observed in both formulations , in the connection picture  @xcite and in the representation picture  @xcite , that the dominant configurations of the partition function often correspond to degenerate geometries . with the results presented here ,",
    "there are two new developments which can modify this conclusion .",
    "this is first the introduction of the constant @xmath86 ( section  [ sect_constant ] ) which provides a natural way of controlling the width of the peaks in the picture of  @xcite .",
    "this is what a coupling constant [ temperature ] in a path integral [ statistical mechanics ] model typically does",
    ". the constant @xmath86 may play an important role when one tries to locate a critical point at which one can renormalize the model .",
    "second , the causal and the euclidean model have amplitudes very different from the original model . in the connection picture ,",
    "the euclidean version can be studied by exactly the same techniques as the original version so that one can start to investigate and compare the models and their physical interpretation .",
    "the transformation of section  [ sect_transback ] then allows us to perform the same studies in the representation picture .",
    "finally , we note that all our formulas for partition functions , matrix elements and expectation values use the language of generic two - complexes .",
    "these are not restricted to be dual to a given triangulation .",
    "the only exceptions were the motivating steps which explicitly involved results from regge calculus which are available only on triangulations .",
