    "mesoscopic physics , or mesoscopics , deals with systems that are large compared to the microscopic ( atomic ) scale but small compared to the macroscopic scale where normal boltzmann transport theory is applicable for transport studies . within the field of mesoscopics one major feature of interest",
    "is quantum interference phenomena , such as the aharonov - bohm effect  @xcite and the phenomena of universal conductance fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "different quantum mechanical waves ( or different parts of a split wave ) can ( re)combine and interfere .",
    "interference effects become important when the size of the system is small compared to the phase breaking length .",
    "another feature in systems of small size on the scale of the electron fermi wavelength is that the motion of the electrons will be quantized into energy levels .",
    "this is the case in a narrow channel electrostatically formed by a split - gate on top of a heterostructure as well as in a nanowire .",
    "the quantization of the transverse motion of the electrons into one - dimensional modes is the cause of the quantized conductance seen in quantum point contacts ( qpc s )  @xcite and nanowires  @xcite .    in a system with",
    "strong space quantization resonant interaction with an external electromagnetic field causes coupling between electron - modes . in this way",
    "transport properties may be strongly affected@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have studied a system where the interplay between interference effects and non - linear resonance phenomena manifests itself .",
    "we show that this interplay provides a new behavior of conduction .",
    "the system under study is a one - dimensional channel in a two - dimensional electron gas ( a 2deg ) with a wider , straight , region irradiated by an external magnetic field , schematically depicted in figure  [ fig : sys ] .",
    "such a channel can be constructed e.g. in a 2deg in a si inversion layer using a split gate technique .",
    "we will consider the case when the system has geometry and field parameters such that only one mode in the narrow parts , connected to the leads , and two modes in the wider region , @xmath0 , are involved in the electron transport . the upper mode is reflected in the qpc s connecting the wider part to the more narrow parts of the channel .",
    "the probability amplitudes corresponding to electrons in different modes and traveling in different directions are denoted as shown in figure  [ fig : sys ] .",

    "we consider a channel with a width , @xmath12 , which varies smoothly on the scale of the fermi wavelength , hence the adiabatic approximation can be used , i.e. the transverse and longitudinal motion can be considered separately in the absence of the external field .",

    "the conductance in a ballistic system is given by the transmission through the well - known landauer formula .",
    "so , in order to describe the transport properties of our system we need to find the transmission and reflection , i.e. the elements of the scattering matrix which connect the probability amplitudes in the two narrow ends , given by @xmath40 we can calculate these elements by noting that our system is similar to a general two barrier system .",

    "the electromagnetic field only couples electrons moving in the same direction , hence we describe this coupling by two different boxes : one for electrons moving from left to right and one for electrons going in the other direction .",
    "if an electron comes out of a box in an upper mode ( @xmath3 or @xmath5 ) it will be reflected in the qpc and enter the other box . when reflected the phase of the electron",

    "[ eq : sys1 ] and  [ eq : sys2 ] ) we can use the result from the two barrier problem to simply write down the elements of the scattering matrix for our system : @xmath50    we see that the total transmission , @xmath51 , is perfect ( equal to unity ) whenever @xmath52 , i.e when , according to eq .",

    "in the numerical calculations we have used parameters corresponding to a si inversion layer : fermi energy @xmath65 mev and effective mass @xmath66 ; and @xmath67 nm .    the total transmission of the considered system as a function of the amplitude and the frequency ( in units of @xmath68 where @xmath69 ) of the external electromagnetic field is shown in figures  [ fig : trans_asym ] and  [ fig : trans_pr ] .",

    "[ eq : analytic ] . for clarity only two of these lines are shown .",
    "[ tc][bc]@xmath13 ( v / mm ) [ bc][tc]@xmath14 @xmath70    there are two different mechanisms that can give perfect reflection : rabi oscillations and interference effects .",
    "the first is when all electrons entering in the lower mode are in the upper mode at the other end of the channel and hence are reflected .",
    "once they reach the first end again they will be back in the lower mode and can exit the field region , hence in this case the transmission equals zero .",
    "looking at the scattering matrix element @xmath48 ( eq .  [ eq : s12 ] ) we see that this `` rabi reflection '' can only happen when @xmath71 ( i.e. in resonance , @xmath72 ) and the amplitude is such that the length of the field region corresponds perfectly to @xmath73 rabi wavelengths , where @xmath56 is an integer .",

    "[ fig : trans_pr ] the length of the channel corresponds to @xmath75 at resonance .",
    "this means that the condition for perfect reflection due to interference is fulfilled at @xmath76 for any amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "perfect transmission in this system is a rabi phenomena .",
    "it happens whenever ( in resonance as well as out of resonance ) all the electrons entering on one side of the channel in the lower mode are all in the lower mode at the other end of the channel , from which they then simply can exit",
    ". this will be the case when the amplitude of the electromagnetic field is such that the length of the field region corresponds perfectly to an integer number of half rabi wavelengths .    at resonance conduction",

    "the length of the channel in these graphs are the same as in figure  [ fig : trans_asym ] .",
    "when the amplitude of the external field becomes smaller the system is very sensitive and the transmission dips of perfect reflection become very narrow , the white lines in figures  [ fig : trans_asym]-[fig : trans_pr ] become thinner . in fact",

    "@xmath80 must vary significantly less than @xmath81 within the temperature range .",
    "this gives us the following condition on the temperature @xmath82    being a phase coherent phenomena by nature resonant backscattering effects can also be destroyed by inelastic relaxation of the photoexcited electrons .",
    "( elastic intermode scattering would also destroy the coherence , but this effect is weak for the narrow channel we consider  @xcite . ) this process may be described by introducing an imaginary part of the phase @xmath80 , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the inelastic mean free path .",
    "the typical excess energy @xmath85 corresponds roughly to the energy spacing between the two transverse levels , which for our system is 19 k. we can use the experimental results by stger et al .",
