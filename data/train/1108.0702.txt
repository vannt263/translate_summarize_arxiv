    "there are many possible approaches to the selection of ccqe candidates in the minerva detector .",
    "we expect , eventually , to have at least three strategies for selection , each of which will select different ccqe - rich final states and admit different backgrounds in the analysis .",
    "first , we can perform a topological track based analysis with a one - track ( muon ) low @xmath0 component and a two - track ( muon and nucleon ) component at higher @xmath0 where reconstruction of the nucleon , at least when it is a proton , is feasible .",
    "this style of analysis can be most easily compared to results using similar techniques from sciboone  @xcite and nomad  @xcite .",
    "second , we can perform an inclusive analysis that selects only a muon and removes background based on a veto on michel electrons from the chain @xmath23 which is most similar to the analysis from the miniboone  @xcite experiment .",
    "finally , one can identify tracks as in the first analysis but remove events with additional visible recoil energy in the detector which is far from the vertex .",
    "the latter stipulation is important for keeping events with low energy nucleons in the final state from the remaining nucleus after the ccqe interaction . the analysis presented here as our first preliminary work towards this reaction is in the final of these three styles .",
    "as we progress in this analysis , we plan to add the other techniques .    .",
    "the track originates in the scintillator region and is momentum analyzed in the minos near detector .",
    "the @xmath24  mev energy deposit away from the track is consistent with the direction of the recoil neutron .",
    "( right ) for simulated events , the recoil energy away from the vertex vs. @xmath0 derived from the muon energy and angle .",

    "this approach , however , lets in significant backgrounds , particularly at high @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : candidate ] . for events originating within the fiducial volume ,",
    "the asymptotic efficiency at high energies is @xmath37 .",
    "the efficiency is highest at low @xmath0 and falls slowly to @xmath38 at high @xmath0 not because of the low recoil selection , but because of the decrease in muon acceptance to enter the minos near detector .",
    "a hit - level geant4-based simulation of the detector is used to evaluate these efficiencies and correct the neutrino interaction simulation for detector efficiencies and resolutions .",
    "we gain confidence in this simulation by comparison of distributions of candidate events in the data with the simulation in quantities that are largely independent of the neutrino flux and the interactions . for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : positions ] shows that the distribution of candidate vertices in the transverse and longitudinal dimensions of the detector agrees with a relatively normalized simulation .",
    "we present the results as comparisons to the simulation , including background events generated as described above .",
    "the simulation also includes our prediction of the untuned flux from a beamline simulation which has large uncertainties that we expect to reduce in the future  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate these uncertainties in the _ a priori _ neutrino flux to be lowest , about @xmath39 , at the peak energy of the flux shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrumrates ] and significantly larger above this `` focusing peak '' energy with an asymptotic uncertainty at high energy of @xmath40 .",
    "these large flux uncertainties must be included in the comparisons between data candidates and the simulation .",
    "these uncertainties allow a significant distortion in shape of the neutrino flux with neutrino energy , @xmath41 .",
    "however , since the @xmath0 spectrum as a function of @xmath41 is approximately independent of @xmath41 , at least far below the kinematic limit , @xmath42 , we do not expect the flux uncertainties to significantly distort the predicted @xmath0 distribution .",

    "the uncertainties shown are statistical only ; flux uncertainties approximately cancel in the analysis of the shape of this distribution , detector systematics and background uncertainties which are not included in the shown uncertainties may not .",
    "the change in shape expected if @xmath46  gev is also shown.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure  [ fig : enu - qsq ] shows the reconstructed neutrino energy and @xmath0 of the reactions for candidate events .",
    "the comparison shows a disagreement outside the uncertainty band in the distribution of neutrino energies just above the focusing peak , @xmath47  gev@xmath48  gev .",
    "however , the shape of the @xmath0 distribution , at least in the region where ccqe events make up the majority of the signal , is in reasonable agreement with our simulation .",
    "note that the simulation uses an axial mass of @xmath49  gev .",
    "miniboone and sciboone , measuring quasi - elastic neutrino and anti - neutrino scattering for @xmath50  gev , prefer significantly higher axial masses , consistent with @xmath46  gev  @xcite , whereas the nomad experiment , measuring quasi - elastic neutrino scattering , @xmath51  gev , prefers @xmath52 consistent with the value of @xmath49  gev assumed in our simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : qsq - by - energy ] shows the ratio of data to simulation for the minerva analysis in the low and high neutrino energy portions of the sample .",
    "both appear more consistent with the low @xmath52 assumed rather than the high @xmath52 of miniboone and sciboone ; however , caution is warranted in drawing this conclusion because the minerva result only includes systematic uncertainties from the neutrino flux , and does not yet include uncertainties on the detector reconstruction or the backgrounds to the quasi - elastic interactions .",
    "the minerva collaboration has performed its first comparison of a quasi - elastic rich anti - neutrino sample with expectations for a range of assumed axial masses .",
    "the selection requires a muon from a neutrino interaction in the scintillator target and a low observed recoil away from the vertex in the final state to enhance elastic events .",
    "minerva possesses an anti - neutrino sample approximately eight times as large as that in this analysis on tape , and will be able to improve the background rejection of this analysis in the future through a variety of techniques that the capabilities of the detector make possible .",
    "this work was supported by the fermi national accelerator laboratory , which is operated by the fermi research alliance , llc , under contract no . de - ac02 - 07ch11359 , including the minerva construction project , with the united states department of energy .",
    "construction support also was granted by the united states national science foundation under nsf award phy-0619727 and by the university of rochester .",
