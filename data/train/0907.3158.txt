    "the complex nonlinear ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) has so wide scope of applications that the concept of  the world of the ginzburg - landau equation \" @xcite is not exaggeration .",
    "the cgle demonstrates its effectiveness in quantum optics , modeling of bose - einstein condensation , condensate - matter physics , study of non - equilibrium phenomena , and nonlinear dynamics , quantum mechanics of self - organizing dissipative systems , and quantum field theory . in optics and laser physics",
    ", the cgle provides an adequate description of mode - locked oscillators and pulse propagation in fibers @xcite .",
    "the cgle is multiparameter and not integrable in a general form . as a result",
    ", an analysis of multitude of its solutions requires extensive numerical simulations .",
    "the exact analytical solutions are known only for a few of cases , when they represent the solitary waves ( dissipative solitons ) and some algebraic relations on the parameters of equation are imposed @xcite . as a rule , one presumes some class of functional expressions to construct the solution . as a result of such presupposition ,",
    "the solutions outside a given class are missed . in principle , the missed solutions can be revealed on basis of the algebraic non - perturbative techniques @xcite , which , nevertheless , need a lot of computer algebra .",
    "these challenges stimulate interest in the approximate methods of integration of the cgle .",
    "the perturbative method has allowed obtaining the dissipative soliton solutions of the reduced and complete cubic - quintic cgle in the limits of small and large dispersion and phase nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "another approximate approach is to reduce an infinite - dimensional ( in terms of degrees of freedom ) problem to finite - dimensional one on basis of , for instance , the method of moments .",
    "this allows tracing an evolution of a finite set of the trial solution parameters @xcite .",
    "however , some physically interesting sectors of the cgle allow an approximation without any functional constraints imposed on the solution or / and the equation parameters .",
    "moreover , dimensionality of the parametric space corresponding to such a solution can be reduced in comparison with the parametric space of the cgle that makes the solution under consideration to be easily traceable .    a physically important sector , which permits an approximate analysis , is represented by the chirped solitary pulse solutions , or the chirped dissipative solitons ( cdss ) of the cgle .",
    "the cds exists in both anomalous and normal dispersion ranges @xcite .",
    "it is very important , that the cds is energy scalable @xcite and can be considered as a model of femtosecond laser pulses with about of and over microjoule energies @xcite .",
    "energy scalability of the cds results from its stretching caused by a large chirp .",
    "hence , the cds with large energy has a reduced peak power that provides its stability @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , a large chirp leads to spectral extra - broadening so that the cds becomes to be compressible down to a few of tens of femtoseconds @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the cds formation is a composite balance of phase and dissipative effects @xcite .",
    "the first effect is a balance of phase contributions from the nonlinear phase distortion and the time - dependent phase affected by a normal dispersion @xcite .",
    "that is possible if a soliton is chirped , but this effect alone does not provide a soliton stability .",
    "the cds stability can be provided by a balance between the nonlinear gain and the spectral dissipation @xcite .",
    "a large chirp of the cds allows two main approximations : i ) soliton stretching admits the adiabatic approximation , ii ) fast phase variation allows applying the stationary phase method in fourier domain @xcite . as a result , the cds of the reduced cubic - quintic one - dimensional cgle @xcite and the generalized one - dimensional cgle ( i.e. the cgle with an imaginary saturable law nonlinearity in terms of @xcite ) @xcite can be represented analytically as the two - parametric solitary pulse solution without any restrictions on its functional form as well as on the equation parameters ( certainly , within the scope of approximations under consideration , see below ) .    here",
    "the extension of this approximate technique to the complete cubic - quintic one - dimensional cgle ( i.e. the cgle with a complex parabolic law nonlinearity @xcite ) is presented .",
    "it is shown , that the cds is the three - parametric solution with five types of the truncated spectral profiles : i ) finger- , ii ) parabolic- , and iii ) flat - top , as well as iv ) concave and v ) concave - convex ones .",
    "the regions of existence and stability of the cds are analyzed systematically within a whole parametric range obeying the condition of domination of a normal dispersion over a spectral dissipation .",
    "the obtained results are validated on the basis of numerical solution of the cgle and compared with the existing results of extensive numerical simulations of the cgle .",
    "let the cgle be written down in the following form @xcite :    @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the propagation ( longitudinal ) coordinate , which can be the propagation distance in a fiber , or the cavity round - trip in a laser oscillator , for instance ; @xmath2 is the  transverse \" coordinate , which can be , for instance , the local time for a propagating laser pulse @xcite .",

    "( [ gl ] ) is under consideration ] .",
    "the second term describes a spectral dissipation ( @xmath7 is the squared inverse bandwidth of spectral filter ) and a dispersion [ @xmath8 is the dispersion coefficient ] .",
    "positivity ( negativity ) of @xmath8 corresponds to normal ( anomalous ) dispersion .",
    "the third term results from a contribution of cubic nonlinearity , which is a sum of contributions from the nonlinear gain [ or the self - amplitude modulation ( sam ) defined by the parameter @xmath90 ] and from the self - phase modulation ( spm ) with the parameter @xmath10 . only the focusing spm with @xmath110 will be considered below . a higher - order ( quintic )",
