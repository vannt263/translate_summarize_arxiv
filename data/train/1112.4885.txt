    "the construction of quantum theories from classical theories , known as quantization , has a long and difficult history .",
    "it starts with the discovery of quantum mechanics in 1925 and the formalization of the quantization procedure by dirac and von neumann .",
    "the construction of a quantum theory from a given classical one is highly non - trivial and non - unique . but except for few examples , it is the only way which will be gone today . from a physical point of view , the world surround us is the result of an underlying quantum theory of its constituent parts",
    "so , one would expect that we must understand the transition from the quantum to the classical world .",
    "but we had developed and tested successfully the classical theories like mechanics or electrodynamics .",
    "therefore one tried to construct the quantum versions out of classical theories . in this paper",
    "we will go the other way to obtain a quantum field theory by geometrical methods and to show its equivalence to a quantization of a classical poisson algebra .",
    "the main technical tool will be the noncommutative geometry developed by connes @xcite",
    ". then intractable space like the leaf space of a foliation can be described by noncommutative algebras . from the physical point of view",
    ", we have now an interpretation of noncommutative algebras ( used in quantum theory ) in a geometrical context .",
    "so , we need only an idea for the suitable geometric structure . for that purpose one",
    "formally considers the path integral over spacetime geometries . in the evaluation of this",
    "integral , one has to include the possibility of different smoothness structures for spacetime @xcite .",
    "brans @xcite was the first who considered exotic smoothness also on open smooth 4-manifolds as a possibility for space - time .",
    "he conjectured that exotic smoothness induces an additional gravitational field ( _ brans conjecture _ ) .",
    "the conjecture was established by asselmeyer @xcite in the compact case and by sadkowski @xcite in the non - compact case .",
    "sadkowski @xcite discussed the influence of differential structures on the algebra @xmath9 of functions over the manifold @xmath10 with methods known as non - commutative geometry .",
    "especially in @xcite he stated a remarkable connection between the spectra of differential operators and differential structures .",
    "but there is a big problem which prevents progress in the understanding of exotic smoothness especially for the @xmath0 : there is no known explicit coordinate representation . as the result no exotic smooth function on any such @xmath0 is known even though there exist families of infinite continuum many different non diffeomorphic smooth @xmath0 .",
    "this is also a strong limitation for the applicability to physics of non - standard open 4-smoothness .",
    "bizaca @xcite was able to construct an infinite coordinate patch by using casson handles .",
    "but it still seems hopeless to extract physical information from that approach .",
    "this situation is not satisfactory but we found a possible solution .",
    "the solution is a careful analysis of the small exotic @xmath0 by using foliation theory ( see especially @xcite ) to derive a relation between exotic smoothness and codimension-1 foliations ( see theorem [ thm : codim-1-foli - radial - fam ] ) . by using noncommutative geometry ,",
    "this approach is able to produce a von neumann algebra via the leaf space of the foliation which can be interpreted as the observable algebra of some qft ( see @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , our approach to exotic smoothness is strongly connected with a codimension-1 foliation of type @xmath11 , i.e. the leaf space is a factor @xmath6 von neumann algebra .",
    "especially this algebra is the preferred algebra in the local algebra approach to qft @xcite .",
    "recently , this factor @xmath11 case was also discussed in connection with quantum gravity ( via the spectral triple of connes ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a deep connection between an exotic @xmath0 as variation of the usual minkowski space with @xmath0-topology .",
    "we start with some introductionary material in the next section . in section",
    "[ sec : quantization ] we present the main result about a relation between exotic @xmath0 and type @xmath6 factor von neumann algebras leading to a possible relation to quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "this relation is presented in the last section with some remarks about the construction of the action functional .",
    "einsteins insight that gravity is the manifestation of geometry leads to a new view on the structure of spacetime . from the mathematical point of view , spacetime is a smooth 4-manifold endowed with a ( smooth ) metric as basic variable for general relativity .",
    "later on , the existence question for lorentz structure and causality problems ( see hawking and ellis @xcite ) gave further restrictions on the 4-manifold : causality implies non - compactness , lorentz structure needs a codimension-1 foliation .",
    "usually , one starts with a globally foliated , non - compact 4-manifold @xmath12 fulfilling all restrictions where @xmath13 is a smooth 3-manifold representing the spatial part .",
    "but other non - compact 4-manifolds are also possible , i.e. it is enough to assume a non - compact , smooth 4-manifold endowed with a codimension-1 foliation .",
    "all these restrictions on the representation of spacetime by the manifold concept are clearly motivated by physical questions . among the properties",
    "there is one distinguished element : the smoothness .",
    "usually one assumes a smooth , unique atlas of charts ( i.e. a smooth or differential structure ) covering the manifold where the smoothness is induced by the unique smooth structure on @xmath14 .",
    "but that is not the full story . even in dimension 4 , there are an infinity of possible other smoothness structures ( i.e. a smooth atlas ) non - diffeomorphic to each other . for a deeper insight",
    "we refer to the book @xcite .",
    "if two manifolds are homeomorphic but non - diffeomorphic , they are * exotic * to each other . the smoothness structure is called an * exotic smoothness structure*.    the implications for physics are tremendous because we rely on the smooth calculus to formulate field theories .",
    "thus different smoothness structures have to represent different physical situations leading to different measurable results .",
    "but it should be stressed that _",
    "exotic smoothness is not exotic physics . _",
    "exotic smoothness is part of topology ( differential topology ) , i.e. a finer determination of the topology ( the smooth atlas of the manifold ) fulfilling the condition of smoothness .",
    "therefore we obtain another parameter to vary a manifold with fixed topology .",
    "usually one starts with a topological manifold @xmath10 and introduces structures on them . then one has the following ladder of possible structures:@xmath15 we do not want to discuss the first transition , i.e. the existence of a triangulation on a topological manifold .",
    "but we remark that the existence of a pl structure implies uniquely a smoothness structure in all dimensions smaller than 7 @xcite",
    ".    given two homeomorphic manifolds @xmath16 , how can we compare both manifolds to decide whether both are diffeomorphic ?",
    "a mapping between two manifolds @xmath16 can be described by a @xmath17dimensional manifold @xmath18 with @xmath19 , called a cobordism @xmath18 . in the following ,",
    "the two homeomorphic manifolds @xmath16 are simple - connected .",
    "the celebrated h - cobordism theorem of smale @xcite gives a simple criteria when a diffeomorphism between @xmath10 and @xmath20 for dimension greater than @xmath21 exists : there is a cobordism @xmath18 between @xmath10 and @xmath20 where the inclusions @xmath22 induce homotopy - equivalences between @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "we call @xmath18 a h - cobordism",
    ". therefore the classification problem of smoothness structures in higher dimensions ( @xmath23 ) is a homotopy - theoretic problem .",
    "the set of smooth structures ( up to h - cobordisms ) of the @xmath24sphere @xmath25 has the structure of an abelian group @xmath26 ( under connected sum @xmath27 ) . via the h - cobordism theorem",
    "this group is identical to the group of homotopy spheres which was analyzed by kervaire and milnor @xcite to be a finite group .",
    "later on the result about the exotic spheres can be extended to any smoothable manifold @xcite , i.e. there is only a finite number of non - diffeomorphic smoothness structures . in all dimensions smaller than four",
    ", there is an unique smoothness structure , the standard structure .",
    "but all methods failed for the special case of dimension four .",
    "now we consider two homeomorphic , smooth , but non - diffeomorphic 4-manifolds @xmath28 and @xmath10 .",
    "as expressed above , a comparison of both smoothness structures is given by a h - cobordism @xmath18 between @xmath28 and @xmath10 ( @xmath29 are homeomorphic ) .",
    "let the 4-manifolds additionally be compact , closed and simple - connected , then we have the structure theorem in the following .",

    "in short that means that the smoothness structure of @xmath10 is determined by the contractable manifold @xmath38  _ its _ _ akbulut cork _  and by the embedding of @xmath38 into @xmath10 . as shown by freedman@xcite",
    ", the akbulut cork has a homology 3-sphere .",
    "] as boundary .",
    "the embedding of the cork can be derived now from the structure of the h - subcobordism @xmath39 between @xmath40 and @xmath38 .",
    "for that purpose we cut @xmath40 out from @xmath28 and @xmath38 out from @xmath10",
    ". then we glue in both submanifolds @xmath41 via the maps @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "both maps @xmath44 are involutions , i.e. @xmath45",
    ". one of these maps ( say @xmath46 ) can be chosen to be trivial ( say @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus the involution @xmath48 determines the smoothness structure .",
    "especially the topology of the akbulut cork @xmath38 and its boundary @xmath49 is given by the topology of @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite with the _ brieskorn - sphere _",
    "@xmath51 as boundary .",
    "akbulut and its coworkers @xcite discuss many examples of akbulut corks and the dependence of the smoothness structure on the cork .",
    "then as shown by bizaca and gompf @xcite the neighborhood @xmath52 of the handle pair as well the neighborhood @xmath53 of the embedded akbulut cork consists of the cork @xmath38 and the casson handle @xmath54 .",

    "furthermore we remark , that _ all results remain true if we use an intersection in @xmath243 instead of an over- or undercrossing . _",
    "_ ad hoc _ the skein algebra is not directly related to the foliation .",
    "we used only the fact that there is an idempotent in the @xmath158 algebra represented by a closed curve .",
    "it is more satisfying to obtain a direct relation between both construction .",
    "then the von neumann algebra of the foliation is the result of a quantization in the physical sense .    with more care ( see @xcite )",
    "we can construct a relation of the skein algebra to the temperley - lieb algebra seen as a subalgebra of the hyperfinite factor @xmath244 algebra .",
    "then we have a closed circle :    1 .",
    "the thurston foliation @xmath156 of the @xmath1 is associated to the hyperfinite factor @xmath6algebra .",
    "2 .   using tomita - takesaki - theory , one has a continuous decomposition ( as crossed product ) of any factor @xmath11 algebra @xmath10 into a factor @xmath159 algebra @xmath52 together with a one - parameter group @xmath160 of automorphisms @xmath161 of @xmath52 .",
    "the factor @xmath159 algebra is isomorphic to @xmath245 .",
    "3 .   as jones @xcite showed , the factor @xmath244 is given by an infinite sequence of temperley - lieb algebras .",
    "4 .   one can construct the foliation @xmath163 , the horocycle flow of @xmath246 of the surface @xmath168 , with factor @xmath159algebra related to @xmath156 .",
    "the skein algebra @xmath242 represents the horocycle flow foliation isomorphic to the temperley - lieb algebra or the factor @xmath244 .",
    "but the skein algebra is the quantization of a poisson algebra given by complex functions over @xmath206 .",
    "therefore the operator algebra of the foliation @xmath163 ( and also of @xmath156 ) comes from the quantization of a classical poisson algebra ( via deformation quantization ) .",
    "one of the central elements in the algebraic quantum field theory is the tomita - takesaki theory leading to the @xmath6 factor as vacuum sector @xcite .",
    "this factor can be now constructed by using the foliation induced by an exotic small @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we will understand a relativistic qft as an algebraic qft ( aqft ) in the sense of haag - kastler ( local quantum field theory ) @xcite .",
    "a series of results , accumulated over a period of more than thirty years , indicates that the local algebras of relativistic qft are type @xmath11 von neumann algebras , and more specifically , hyperfinite type@xmath6 factors .",
    "therefore our relation between exotic @xmath0 and this factor is a crucial step in the understanding of qft from the geometrical point of view .",
    "any realistic qft starts with an action to fix the fields . here",
    "we will discuss a method to derive this action using the structure of the exotic @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will start with some remarks .",
    "after the work of witten @xcite on topological qfts , there were a growing interest in the relation between qft and topology .",
    "witten proposed a supersymmetric qft to obtain the donaldson polynomials as expectation values .",
    "then the further development of this approach led directly to the seiberg - witten invariants @xcite .",
    "therefore one would expect a strong relation between qft and 4-dimensional differential topology .",
    "our approach above gives some hint in this direction .",
    "the interpretation of this relation is given by the infinite constructions in 4-manifold theory like casson handle @xcite or capped gropes @xcite used in the construction of the relation between codimension-1 foliations and exotic @xmath0 .",
    "all these structures are described by trees .",
    "for example a casson handle @xmath54 is specified up to ( orientation preserving ) diffeomorphism ( of pairs ) by a labeled finitely - branching tree with base - point * , having all edge paths infinitely extendable away from * . each edge should be given a label @xmath247 or @xmath248 . here is the construction : tree @xmath249 .",
    "each vertex corresponds to a kinky handle ; the self - plumbing number of that kinky handle equals the number of branches leaving the vertex .",
    "the sign on each branch corresponds to the sign of the associated self plumbing .",
    "the whole process generates a tree with infinite many levels . in principle",
    ", every tree with a finite number of branches per level realizes a corresponding casson handle .",
    "the casson handle is at the heart of small exotic @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we have to understand one level of the tree",
    ". then the infinite repetition of the levels forms the tree .",
    "but the basic structure in qft is also given by a tree expressing the renormalized fields by the forest formula @xcite .",
    "so we start with the basic structure of the casson handle forming the levels of the tree in 4-manifold theory , the immersed disk .",
    "now we will follow the paper @xcite very closely .",
    "let @xmath250 be a 2-disk and @xmath10 a 4-manifold as spacetime .",
    "the map @xmath251 is called an immersion if the differential @xmath252 is injective .",
    "it is known from singularity theory @xcite that every map of a 2-manifold into a 4-manifold can be deformed to an immersion , the immersion may not be an embedding i.e. the immersed disk may have self - intersections .",
    "for the following discussion we consider the immersion @xmath253 of the disk into one chart @xmath61 of @xmath10",
    ".    for simplicity , start with a toy model of an immersion of a surface into the 3-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "let @xmath254 be a smooth map of a riemannian surface with injective differential @xmath255 , i.e. an immersion .",
    "in the _ weierstrass representation _ one expresses a _ conformal minimal _",
    "immersion @xmath256 in terms of a holomorphic function @xmath257 and a holomorphic 1-form @xmath258 as the integral@xmath259 an immersion of @xmath260 is conformal if the induced metric @xmath261 on @xmath260 has components@xmath262 and it is minimal if the surface has minimal volume .",
    "now we consider a spinor bundle @xmath168 on @xmath260 ( i.e. @xmath263 as complex line bundles ) and with the splitting@xmath264 therefore the pair @xmath265 can be considered as spinor field @xmath266 on @xmath260 .",
    "then the cauchy - riemann equation for @xmath261 and @xmath267 is equivalent to the dirac equation @xmath268 .",
    "the generalization from a conformal minimal immersion to a conformal immersion was done by many authors ( see the references in@xcite ) to show that the spinor @xmath266 now fulfills the dirac equation@xmath269 where @xmath84 is the mean curvature ( i.e. the trace of the second fundamental form ) .",
    "the minimal case is equivalent to the vanishing mean curvature @xmath270 recovering the equation above .",
    "friedrich @xcite uncovered the relation between a spinor @xmath271 on @xmath272 and the spinor @xmath273 : if the spinor @xmath271 fulfills the dirac equation @xmath274 then the restriction @xmath273 fulfills equation ( [ eq : conformal - immersion - dirac ] ) and @xmath275 .",
    "therefore we obtain@xmath276 with @xmath277",
    ".    now we will discuss the more complicated case .",
    "for that purpose we consider the kinky handle which can be seen as the image of an immersion @xmath278 .",
    "this map determines a restriction of the immersion @xmath279 with image a knotted solid torus @xmath280 . but a knotted solid torus @xmath281 is uniquely determined by its boundary @xmath282 , a knotted torus given as image @xmath283 of the immersion @xmath284 . but as discussed above , this immersion @xmath285 can be defined by a spinor @xmath266 on @xmath286 fulfilling the dirac equation@xmath287 with @xmath277 ( or an arbitrary constant ) ( see theorem 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the transition to the case of the immersion @xmath288 can be done by constructing a spinor @xmath289 out of @xmath266 which is constant along the normal of the immersed torus @xmath286 . as discussed above a spinor bundle over a surface",
    "splits into two sub - bundles @xmath290 with the corresponding splitting of the spinor @xmath266 in components@xmath291 and we have the dirac equation@xmath292 with respect to the coordinates @xmath293 on @xmath286 . in dimension 3",
    "we have a spinor bundle of same fiber dimension then the spin bundle @xmath168 but without a splitting into two sub - bundles .",
    "now we define the extended spinor @xmath289 over the solid torus @xmath294 via the restriction @xmath295 .",
    "then @xmath289 is constant along the normal vector @xmath296 fulfilling the 3-dimensional dirac equation@xmath297 induced from the dirac equation ( [ eq:2d - dirac ] ) via restriction and where @xmath298 especially we obtain for the mean curvature@xmath299 of the knotted solid torus @xmath300 ( up to a constant from @xmath301 ) . or in local coordinates @xmath302 with the pauli matrices @xmath303 .",
    "thus the level of the tree is described by the mean curvature @xmath304 of the knotted solid torus @xmath300 or invariantly by the integral@xmath305 with the metric @xmath306 at @xmath300 , i.e. by the dirac action .",
    "now we will discuss the extension from the 3d to the 4d case .",
    "let @xmath307 be an immersion of the solid torus @xmath308 into the 4-manifold @xmath10 with the normal vector @xmath309 .",
    "the spin bundle @xmath310 of the 4-manifold splits into two sub - bundles @xmath311 where one subbundle , say @xmath312 can be related to the spin bundle @xmath313 .",
    "then the spin bundles are related by @xmath314 with the same relation @xmath315 for the spinors ( @xmath316 and @xmath317 ) .",
    "let @xmath318 be the covariant derivatives in the spin bundles along a vector field @xmath39 as section of the bundle @xmath319 .",
    "then we have the formula@xmath320 with the obvious embedding @xmath321 of the spinor spaces . the expression",
    "@xmath322 is the second fundamental form of the immersion with trace the mean curvature @xmath323 .",
    "then from ( [ eq : covariant - derivative - immersion ] ) one obtains a similar relation between the corresponding dirac operators@xmath324 with the dirac operator @xmath325 defined via ( [ eq : dirac - equation-3d ] ) .",
    "together with equation ( [ eq : dirac - equation-3d ] ) we obtain@xmath326 i.e. @xmath271 is a parallel spinor .    _",
    "conclusion : _ there is a relation between a 3-dimensional spinor @xmath289 on a 3-manifold @xmath13 fulfilling a dirac equation @xmath327 ( determined by the immersion @xmath328 into a 4-manifold @xmath10 ) and a 4-dimensional spinor @xmath271 on a 4-manifold @xmath10 with fixed chirality ( @xmath329 or @xmath330 ) fulfilling the dirac equation @xmath331 .    from the dirac equation ( [ eq : dirac - equation-4d ] ) we obtain the the action@xmath332 as an extension of ( [ eq : action-3d ] ) to the whole spacetime @xmath10 .",
    "by variation of the action ( [ eq : action-3d ] ) we obtain an immersion of minimal mean curvature , i.e. @xmath270 .",
    "then we can identify via relation ( [ eq : relation - dirac-3d-4d ] ) the 4-dimensional and the 3-dimensional action via @xmath333 therefore the 3-dimensional action ( [ eq : action-3d ] ) can be extended to the whole 4-manifold ( but for a spinor @xmath271 of fixed chirality ) .",
    "finally we showed that the spinor can be extended to the whole 4-manifold @xmath10 .",
    "the integral over the mean curvature @xmath334 on the rhs of the action can be also expressed by@xmath335 by using a frame @xmath149 and the curvature 2-form @xmath65 .",
    "this term can be interpreted as the boundary term of the einstein - hilbert action . as shown by york @xcite",
    ", the fixing of the conformal class of the spatial metric in the adm formalism leads to a boundary term which can be also found in the work of hawking and gibbons @xcite .",
    "also ashtekar et.al .",
    "@xcite discussed the boundary term in the palatini formalism .",
    "therefore we have@xmath336 with @xmath337 .",
    "thus we obtain the einstein - hilbert action for the target space of the knotted torus @xmath300 as representation of the immersed disk . up to now",
    "we have studied the immersion of the disk ( as well its neighborhood via its boundary the knotted solid torus @xmath300 ) and the relation to the target space .",
    "one problem is left : the connection of the disks to each other .",
    "geometrically we have a cobordisms between two knotted solid tori @xmath338 and @xmath339 , the connecting tube @xmath340 .",
    "the corresponding integral@xmath341 can be convert to @xmath342 by using the stokes theorem , the extension of the curvature @xmath156 on @xmath343 to @xmath344 on @xmath340 and the instanton equation @xmath345 along the tube .",
    "but then we have the yang - mills action for the curvature @xmath344 .",
    "we will not discuss the details and refer to@xcite .",
    "finally we will obtain the correct gauge group @xmath346 and get the action @xmath347    as conclusion we can state that an immersed disk used in the construction of exotic @xmath0 are described by a parallel spinor @xmath271 .",
    "the correspondence goes further because the spinor @xmath271 as solution of the dirac equation ( [ eq : dirac - equation-4d ] ) is not only generated by a propagator but also by the immersed disk itself .",
    "the feynman path integral of this action can be rearranged by a simply reorganization of the perturbative series in terms of trees @xcite .",
    "it should be especially emphasized that this method do not need any discretization of the phase space or cluster expansion .",
    "then we obtain a close relation between trees and renormalization similar to approach of connes and kreimer @xcite .",
