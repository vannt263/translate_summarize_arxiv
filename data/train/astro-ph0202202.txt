    "the highest redshift ( z ) quasars are of interest not only for their ` record setting ' quality , but also because they can tell us about the formation of quasars and about conditions in the first few percent of the age of the universe .",
    "the discovery of z@xmath1 quasars ( fan 2001 ; hereafter paper i ) was remarkable as it showed that luminous quasars with massive black - holes had formed when the universe was less than a gyr old .",
    "quasars , , and at z=5.82 , 6.28 , 5.80 and 5.99 respectively were discovered as a part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york 2000 ) imaging multicolor observations .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy revealed rich quasar spectra with strong forest .",
    "the importance of these observations was amplified by the realization that the neutral hydrogen fraction of the intergalactic medium increases drastically around z@xmath1 , marking it to be the epoch of end of reionization ( becker 2001 , fan 2002 , pentericci 2002 ) .",
    "observations of high redshift quasars are also important to understand quasar evolution and associated , possible , growth of massive black holes .",
    "while the evidence for the evolution of the quasar luminosity function is clear ( boyle 2000 ) , we still do not know _ how _ the quasars evolve , i.e. which of observed properties of quasars exhibit change with time .",
    "mathur ( 2000 ) suggested that accretion rate relative eddington is likely to be a function of time , in which case properties related to accretion , such as those contributing to `` eigenvector 1 '' ( boroson 2001 ) would be expected to change .",
    "x - ray studies of high redshift quasars are important as the x - ray slope changes with accretion rate and so may give us information about the evolution .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution of quasars also changes with accretion rate . while small changes are difficult to see , the extreme cases , e.g. advection driven accretion flows ( adaf ) show clearly different spectral energy distributions , including that in the x - ray band ( narayan 1998 and references there in ) .",
    "so the hope of x - ray studies of high redshift quasars is that they may give us some clue about early accretion process , and so , possibly , about their evolution .",
    "this goal has not been achieved yet , because x - ray detections of high redshift quasars have been rare . prior to and",
    "xmm - newton era , only a handful of z@xmath2 quasars were detected in x - rays ( kaspi 2000 and references there in ) .",
    "thanks to the sensitivity of the observatory , the total number of x - ray detected z@xmath2 quasars is now over two dozen ( silverman 2002 , vignali 2001 , hereafter paper ii , and references there in ) . at redshift @xmath3 , however , the numbers are very sparse .",
    "the z=5.8 quasar was detected with xmm - newton ( brandt 2001 , mathur 2001 ) and a z@xmath4 quasar is reported to be detected with ( brandt 2002 ) ( a z=5.27 quasar sdssp j120823.82 + 001027.7 is also reported to be detected by vignali 2001 , but with only two counts , this is questionable ) . in spite of these small numbers ,",
    "there have been tantalizing suggestions of changes of x - ray properties of quasars with redshift ( e.g. paper ii , and references there in ) .",
    "vignali ( 2001 ) found suggestive evidence that detected high redshift quasars are fainter in x - rays compared to those detected earlier with rosat .",
    "mathur ( 2001 ) found that the z=5.8 quasar is likely to have a steep x - ray slope .",
    "while these suggestions need to be confirmed with better observations , trends are encouraging . in this paper",
    "we report the  detections of three z@xmath1 sdss quasars .",
    "the sub - arcsecond angular resolution and very low background makes ideal for detecting faint sources like high redshift quasars .",
    "the z@xmath1 quasars , , and were observed with x - ray observatory on 29 january 2002 with director s discretionary time .",
    "the data were made available to the astronomical community immediately .",
    "we downloaded the data from the x - ray center ( cxc ) archive .",
    "observation details are given in table 1 .",
    "all the three observations were performed using the detector advanced ccd imaging spectrometer for spectroscopy ( acis - s ) .",
    "the sources were observed at the nominal aim - point on the back illuminated ccd s3 .",
    "analysis was performed in a standard manner using the software  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao version 2.2.1 ; elvis , in preparation ) + ( see also data processing threads at http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/documents_threads.html ) .",
    "virtually all source counts are contained in the 2.9  ( 5.75 pixel ) radius extraction aperture that was centered upon the x - ray source centroid .",
    "background counts were estimated from an annulus with inner and outer radii of 10 and 30 pixels , respectively .",
    "the background counts expected in the source extraction region are between 0.2 and 0.3 for the three sources , so we ignore the background in rest of the analysis .",
    "all the three sources are clearly detected in the broad band ( 0.58.0 kev ) . to determine the centroid position of the sources we used ciao tool * wavdetect * ( freeman 2002 ) .",
    "the x - ray positions of all the three sources are within @xmath5 of the optical positions ( table 2 ) .",
    "we also extracted source counts in the soft ( 0.52.5 kev ) and hard ( 58 kev ) bands separately .",
    "figure 1 shows the broad band acis - s images .",
    "we calculated the probability of serendipitous source detection using the observed source flux distribution of hasinger ( 1998 ) .",
    "assuming the 0.52.5 kev flux limit of @xmath6 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath8 for the faintest of the three sources , and a detection cell of @xmath9 radius , the expected number of sources is @xmath10 for each of the observation .",
    "so it is highly unlikely that the detected sources are unrelated to the quasars .",
    "we therefore conclude that sdss sources observed by are detected .    using the observed count rate , the broad band flux was determined assuming a power law slope of @xmath11 and the galactic  values for each source ( table 2 ) .",
    "the rest frame luminosity was calculated for two different cosmologies : h@xmath12 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and q@xmath13 for consistency with earlier work and also with h@xmath14 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and q@xmath13 .",
    "the observed properties of all the three sources are presented in table 2 .",
    "the detections of z@xmath1 quasars in x - rays demonstrates the power of to detect such faint sources .",
    "the sources are detected up to rest frame energies of @xmath0 kev . with only a few counts detected , however , detailed source information is difficult to obtain",
    ". nevertheless , we can learn about the overall broad band spectral energy distributions by determining the optical to x - ray ratio  ( defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are monochromatic flux densities at 2 kev and 2500   respectively in the rest frame of a quasar ; tananbaum 1979 ) .",
    "we calculated the optical monochromatic luminosity at 2500   using observed optical flux ( paper i ) and assuming a power - law optical continuum slope with @xmath18 .",
    "the use of @xmath18 is appropriate for the observed continuum in paper i. the monochromatic luminosity at 2 kev was calculated assuming power - law slope @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting  values are 1.49 , 1.61 , and 1.48 for , and respectively ( table 2 ) .",
    "these are within the range observed for normal lower redshift quasars ( e.g. brandt 2001 ) .",
    "thus the broad band x - ray properties of these highest redshift quasars do not appear to be any different from lower redshift objects .    for comparison with earlier work ( silverman 2002 , paper ii ) , in figure 2",
    "we have plotted the observed x - ray fluxes of z@xmath2 quasars vs. their ab@xmath20 magnitudes along with those reported here .",
    "the z@xmath1 quasars do not occupy any conspicuously different region on this plot , nor do the x - ray selected ( rosat ) sources look particularly bright (  1 ) . in figure 3 , we have plotted the x - ray to optical flux ratio as a function of redshift .",
    "no obvious trend with redshift is apparent .",
    "x - ray astronomers have traditionally used hardness ratios to extract spectral information when observed counts are too few to perform spectral analysis ( mathur 2001 and references there in ) .",
    "the hardness ratio is defined as hr=(soft @xmath21 hard)@xmath22(soft @xmath23 hard ) where `` soft '' and `` hard '' are the counts in energy bands 0.5@xmath212.5 kev and 2.5@xmath218.0 kev respectively ( we prefer hr over the band ratio br = soft@xmath22hard sometimes used in the literature .",
    "hr is bounded well between @xmath24 and 1 for detected sources , compared to the 0 to @xmath25 range of br ) . in these high - redshift sources",
    "we are observing rest frame energies above @xmath26 kev so that only highly absorbed sources would show evidence for absorption and we expect to be observing the pure continuum emission .",
    "the hr ratio of is consistent with that expected with a power - law slope @xmath19 .",
    "this object , however , is radio - loud ( paper i ) and so its x - ray slope is expected to be flatter around a mean @xmath18 ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ) . for",
    ", no counts are detected in the hard band , resulting in hr=1 . a power - law with slope @xmath272",
    "would then be required . for , on the other hand , a flatter power - law with @xmath28",
    "would be required to reproduce the observed hr of 0.56 .",
    "we caution , however , against attaching too much significance to the above results , given the errors associated with observed counts in each band . within the errors ,",
    "the sources are consistent with the normal power - law slope expected for quasars , except possibly for .",
    "possibly , the most remarkable thing about these highest redshift quasars is that they are so absolutely unremarkable in both optical and x - ray bands implying no strong evolution out to redshifts @xmath29 .",
    "the only possible difference could be in the x - ray spectral slope which could not be determined with the data . a lot more counts are needed to determine the exact spectral shape of these objects .",
    "the expected count rates with xmm - newton are 11 , 3 and 6 per ksec for the three objects respectively , for combined epic - pn and epic - mos detectors with thin filters .",
    "for the brightest two objects a crude spectrum with about 300 counts can be obtained in a reasonable observing time of 2550 ksec .",
    "we have an on - going program with xmm - newton to do precision spectroscopy of some z@xmath30 quasars . extending this program",
    "to highest redshifts would be particularly interesting . clearly , we have to work harder and look deeper to understand quasar evolution .",
    "we thank the entire team for a very successful mission .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge support from grant go-2118x from smithsonian astrophysical observatory to sm and nasa contract nas8 - 39073 ( cxc ) to bjw and hg .",
