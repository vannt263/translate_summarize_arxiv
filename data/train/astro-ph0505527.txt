    "we explore the possibility that some iron produced by type ia supernovae in galaxy groups and clusters may have radiatively cooled and avoided detection by x - ray and optical observers . because of the large radiative emissivity of extremely iron - rich plasmas produced by type ia supernovae ( sniae ) , it is possible that this gas cools rapidly to low temperatures where it may be difficult to observe .",
    "even if all snia iron radiatively cooled in an elliptical galaxy , the total collective x - ray luminosity would be small because the thermal energy content of the iron - rich cores in type ia supernova remnants is very much less than that of the radiating hot gas distributed throughout the galaxy or cluster .",
    "another motivation for this inquiry are the central abundance minima often observed in the hot gas inside central massive ellipticals in galaxy groups and clusters ( dupke & white , 2000 ; johnstone , et al 2002 ; sanders & fabian 2002 ; schmidt , fabian & sanders 2002 ; blanton , sarazin & mcnamara 2003 ; buote et al .",
    "when present , these minima typically lie within the central @xmath0 kpc , just where abundances in the hot gas are likely to be dominated by sniae in the central elliptical galaxy .",
    "( the stellar density is more centrally peaked than the gas density . )",
    "another possible motivation is the observation of unexpectedly low iron abundance in the hot gas within some elliptical galaxies of moderate or low @xmath1 . in a recent study of three x - ray faint elliptical galaxies",
    "osullivan & ponman ( 2004 ) found very low iron abundances in the interstellar gas , @xmath2 . using _",
    "data humphrey , buote & canizares ( 2004 ) estimated @xmath3 in the low @xmath4 early - type galaxies ngc 1332 and ngc 720 , perhaps indicating that @xmath5 solar gas - phase iron abundances are more typical . however , the supersolar iron abundances predicted by our gasdynamical models for isolated elliptical galaxies typically exceed @xmath6 ( e.g. mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "additional motivations for considering the cooling of iron - rich supernova remnants are ( 1 ) the difficulty of understanding how type ii and type ia supernovae enrich the hot gas in rich clusters of galaxies ( gibson & matteucci 1997 ; moretti et al .",
    "2003 ; baumgartner et al . 2003",
    "; loewenstein 2004 ; portinari et al . 2004",
    "; tornatore et al .",
    "2004 , but see tamura et al . 2004 ) and ( 2 ) the discord in metal abundances between rich galaxy clusters and galaxy groups or elliptical galaxies ( e.g. renzini 1997 , 2000 ; brighenti & mathews 1999 ) .",
    "perhaps there are significant errors in supernova yields or in metallicity observations .",
    "but in these recent attempts to understand the metal enrichment history of galaxy clusters , it is assumed that all of the iron produced by supernovae is still currently visible either in stars or in the hot gas .",
    "this is the assumption that we investigate here .",
    "it is necessary to establish that the iron visible today faithfully represents the total iron produced over time , particularly since the total historical number of supernovae in old stellar populations is uncertain .",
    "alternatively , the lower iron content in groups and individual elliptical galaxies relative to massive clusters may be explained if supernova products are physically removed from the observed hot gas by winds or buoyancy .",
    "this scenario could simultaneously explain the relatively low iron abundance in gas associated with individual non - cluster elliptical galaxies and the larger amount of gas - phase iron in clusters .",
    "morris & fabian ( 2003 ) show that the enhanced radiative cooling of iron - rich inhomogeneities may occur without producing appreciable evidence of cooling in x - ray spectra . unlike the iron - rich cooling discussed by morris & fabian  in which gas with different abundances was assumed to be at the same initial temperature  the iron in snia remnants",
    "is created at temperatures that significantly exceed that of the ambient hot gas , so the removal of snia iron by selective radiative cooling is not immediately obvious . in view of this",
    "we also estimate the inhomogeneity in snia iron that would be expected due to the sparse distribution of snia events on galactic scales .    in the following we describe possible thermal histories for the iron produced by snia explosions in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we begin with estimates of the post - supernova temperature of the iron - rich gas using gasdynamical models .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of possible scenarios for the rate that the iron - rich gas cools by thermal mixing and radiation losses .",
    "our results suggest that much of the snia iron in cluster - centered elliptical galaxies may mix successfully with the ambient hot gas , but only if magnetic fields have little influence on the diffusion of iron ions .",
    "as we discuss below , the long term survival of iron introduced by type ia supernovae into the hot interstellar gas depends critically on the additional thermal energy imparted to the gas during the supernova explosion .",
    "most calculations of the evolution of supernova remnants describe the early , luminous stages relevant to remnants observed in the milky way .",
    "instead , we are interested in estimating the temperature of the iron - rich remnant gas after @xmath7 years when it has acquired essentially the same pressure as the local interstellar gas in a typical elliptical galaxy .",
    "the energy released by the @xmath8 decay of cobalt , which sustains the snia light curve and decreases exponentially @xmath9 in @xmath10 days , can be neglected in the total energy budget and on the very long time scales of interest here .",
    "the one dimensional gas dynamical calculations of mathews ( 1990 ) and dorfi & vlk ( 1996 ) describe various aspects of type ia explosions in the rarefied gas in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the expanding stellar remnant cools by adiabatic expansion to exceedingly low temperatures and is then heated by a reverse shock as it is decelerated by the interstellar gas .",
    "> from dimensional considerations , the characteristic temperature of the stellar iron is @xmath11 k for @xmath12 ergs and @xmath13 @xmath14 . but this greatly overestimates the final iron temperature because ( 1 ) only a rather small amount of gas experiences shock velocities as large as @xmath15 , and ( 2 ) only a comparatively small fraction of the supernova energy goes into heating the stellar gas in the stellar remnant  most of the supernova energy is delivered to the surrounding interstellar medium by an expanding shock wave .    to estimate the final temperature of the iron - rich gas we have calculated several simple one dimensional snia blast waves in the hot interstellar gas in elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is generally accepted that small particle larmor radii in microgauss magnetic fields allow these strong shocks to be treated with normal continuum gas dynamics and we assume this to be true .",
    "we also assume spherical symmetry which is unlikely to hold in detail .",
    "non - spherical irregularities resulting from subsonic deflagration are expected inside the young stellar remnant and the deceleration of the expanding stellar gas results in rayleigh - taylor instabilities producing further spatial deformations . however , these details , which are ignored here , are unlikely to significantly influence our estimates of the mean gas temperature during the final stages of the remnant evolution when hydrostatic equilibrium is established throughout the iron - rich gas .",
    "for an initial remnant configuration we employ the simple post - deflagration stellar remnant described for the w7 snia model of mass @xmath16 @xmath14 proposed by dwarkadas & chevalier ( 1998 ) , which is based on the calculations by hflich & khokhlov ( 1996 ) .",
    "the density distribution at time @xmath17 is described by @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the initial velocity field is linear @xmath20 . for any assumed initial time",
    "@xmath17 integrations of @xmath21 to a total mass @xmath13 @xmath14 and the kinetic energy density @xmath22 to @xmath12 ergs determine @xmath23 and the initial stellar radius @xmath24 of the contact discontinuity between stellar and ambient gas .",
    "the initial time @xmath25 sec for our calculations is chosen so that @xmath24 is much less than the radius of ambient gas that contains the stellar mass ejected @xmath26 pc where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the ambient interstellar mass and electron densities . to estimate the temperature of the iron plasma when the final snia remnant has reached pressure equilibrium , we calculated the evolution of several remnants for @xmath29 years using a high - resolution 1d eulerian code . for simplicity",
    "the entire @xmath30 star is assumed to be essentially pure iron ( @xmath31 ) ; the hot ambient gas is assumed to have solar abundance .",
    "the code solves an additional equation for the iron density to determine the iron abundance @xmath32 . in figure 1",
    "we illustrate the gas temperature profile @xmath33 after time @xmath34 years produced in interstellar medium of density @xmath35 @xmath36 and temperature @xmath37 k. the vertical dashed line in figure 1 shows the full extent of the stellar gas and the arrow points to the radius of the stellar core that includes 0.7 @xmath14 of pure iron .",
    "the outer layers of the expanded star contain si and other elements . at this time",
    "the stellar - interstellar contact discontinuity is at @xmath38 pc and the pressure is nearly uniform at all radii and equal to that in the initial ambient gas . beyond the iron rich remnant the gas temperature decreases , reflecting the weakening of the expanding blast wave .",
    "the shock at @xmath34 yrs can be seen in figure 1 as a small vertical feature at 65 pc .",
    "the temperature of the iron - rich stellar gas generally increases toward the center , corresponding to converging reverse shocks that grow stronger with time .",
    "an insignificant mass of gas near the center has a temperature comparable to @xmath39 .    for the profile shown in figure 1",
    "we find that the mass weighted mean temperature in the central 0.7@xmath14 is @xmath40 k. table 1 lists the mean gas temperatures @xmath41 and @xmath42 within the central @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the final pressure - equilibrium remnants ( at time @xmath34 yr ) computed for ambient gas at several densities and temperatures typical of hot gas at different radii inside elliptical galaxies .",

    "we consider a collisionally ionized plasma of hydrogen , helium and iron .",
    "the temperature range of interest extends from @xmath49 k , where h and he are fully ionized , to @xmath50 k , corresponding to completely ionized iron ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",

    "have bound electrons . for our plasma of h , he and fe , the number of free electrons per iron ion is @xmath72 in a normal plasma with solar abundances ( @xmath73 ) the number of electrons per iron ion is @xmath74 .",

    "we have also computed the cooling coefficient @xmath90 for an iron - free plasma with solar abundances for all the other elements ( as listed by feldman 1992 ) .",
    "these cooling coefficients can be combined to give the cooling rate for any iron abundance @xmath91 , @xmath92 as we illustrate in figure 3 , in an iron - rich plasma the cooling coefficient @xmath93 can be many orders of magnitude greater than that for a plasma with solar abundance .",
    "however , the emission rate @xmath94 approaches a finite value as @xmath75 that is only about @xmath95 times larger than the emissivity at solar abundance , provided the gas density is held constant . for @xmath96 the peak emission is shifted toward higher temperatures .",
    "the cooling coefficients shown in figure 3 are our analytic fits to the xspec results for @xmath90 and @xmath88 .",
    "after heating by the reverse shock , the temperature of the iron core in snia remnants is about 2 - 15 times greater than that in the surrounding hot interstellar gas ( table 1 ) .",
    "we shall estimate the subsequent thermal evolution of this iron - rich gas as it cools by radiation losses and by mixing with the cooler interstellar gas .",
    "the mixing processes that occur when the iron plasma encounters the ambient ( solar abundance ) plasma are exceedingly complex .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor instability that accompanies the deceleration of the stellar remnant greatly increases the surface area between the iron and ambient plasmas .",
    "this mixing process is further assisted by irregularities in the exploding star and by interstellar turbulence expected from observations and general theoretical considerations . however , coarse grain mixing of the iron is insufficient for our purposes .",
    "mixing must occur on an _ atomic _ level to influence the radiation losses .",
    "once the surface area at the plasma interface has been enormously increased by coarse grain mixing , particle diffusion is essential to mix individual iron ions into the ambient gas and this diffusion depends on the strength and orientation of the local magnetic field . in view of the profound difficulty in estimating the ion mixing time due to diffusion",
    ", we shall simply assume that this mixing occurs on a timescale @xmath97 that we regard as a parameter .",
    "the iron - rich gas cools by two processes : ( 1 ) thermal mixing with cooler ambient solar abundance gas and ( 2 ) radiative losses . at any time we assume that a fraction @xmath98 of the mass of colder ambient gas has physically mixed with the current iron - rich supernova core .",
    "initially when @xmath99 the gas is essentially pure iron ; when the mass of mixed ambient gas is much greater than that of the snia remnant , @xmath100 and the iron abundance is nearly that of the ambient gas ( with @xmath6 ) .",
    "we assume for simplicity that this mixing occurs on a timescale @xmath97 so that the fraction of cold gas that has mixed at time @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 initially at @xmath103 when @xmath99 we consider a hot plasma at temperature @xmath104 that is sufficiently iron - rich , @xmath105 , so that the electrons contributed by iron dominate . for a plasma of any composition",
    ", the ratio of iron mass to total mass is @xmath106 ( equation 3 ) .",
    "consequently , as the iron - rich gas mixes with ambient gas at temperature @xmath107 , the instantaneous iron abundance @xmath108 is found from @xmath109    the numerical solution for the thermal variation of the iron - rich plasma during a small time interval proceeds in two steps : first we determine the thermal change due to mixing alone then we compute the losses due to radiation during that same time interval . during the mixing step the specific thermal energy @xmath110 varies as the relative mass @xmath98 of cold gas mixes in . for a given time",
    "step @xmath111 equation ( 9 ) can be used to determine the change in the fraction of cold gas @xmath112 . the decreased iron abundance @xmath113 is found from equation ( 10 ) .",

    "finally , we note that the change in slope of the cooling time @xmath143 at @xmath147 is caused by the slope change at this temperature in @xmath148 ( figure 3 ) .    in figure 5 we plot the final cooling times ( to @xmath149 k ) for four assumed initial temperatures for the iron - rich plasma @xmath150 and four pressures @xmath118 , corresponding to different radii in the the hot gas atmospheres of luminous elliptical galaxies . for each calculation",

    "similar non - monotonic @xmath152 profiles occur if @xmath153 or @xmath154 are changed . in the following",
    "we explain this counterintuitive behavior in more detail .",
    "when @xmath155 , as shown in the upper left panel of figure 5 , the mixing does not cool the iron - rich gas but only dilutes it with gas having solar abundance . as the dilution or mixing time @xmath97 increases smoothly , the cooling time @xmath143 suddenly drops precipitously at a particular value of @xmath156 .",
    "when @xmath157 , the plasmas with different abundance tend to mix completely before radiative cooling occurs and @xmath143 is just the cooling time of the interstellar gas with solar abundance ( dashed lines for each @xmath118 ) . eventually , when @xmath97 just exceeds @xmath158 , the supernova gas cools rapidly when it still has an iron abundance much greater than solar .",
    "as can be seen in figure 5 , the transition in @xmath152 is very sharp indeed  the cooling time drops by @xmath146 .    in the other three panels of figure 5 we illustrate the cooling time variation @xmath152 for the iron rich supernova ejecta using more realistic initial temperatures @xmath159 k. as @xmath97 approaches @xmath158 from below , the cooling time increases",
    "this can be understood by examining the cooling evolution @xmath141 in more detail .",
    "the temperature and cooling time minima ( as in figure 4 ) become more pronounced when @xmath160 , but after this minimum the gas temperature returns to @xmath153 and cools on a longer timescale . when @xmath160 , the sharp decrease in the cooling time in figure 5 at @xmath158 is followed by progressively longer cooling times as @xmath97 increases further .",
    "to demonstrate further the curious non - monotonic relationship between the cooling and mixing times , we illustrate in figure 6 the cooling evolution for four values of @xmath161 , @xmath46 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 years .",
