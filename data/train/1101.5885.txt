    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) is the key technology for attosecond science .",
    "the shortest pulse durations currently achieved are below 100 as @xcite .",
    "highly efficient sources are available having a bandwidth of hundreds of electronvolts @xcite being large enough to produce pulses of only 10 as duration  in case they can be generated without chirp in the future .",
    "many properties of hhg radiation emitted from a gas target can be understood by studying a single atom .",
    "the three - step model @xcite is the simplest model to describe the single - atom dynamics .",
    "the process starts when a strong laser field liberates the electron of an atom and subsequently drives it in the continuum .",
    "if ionization happenend at the right time , the electron can be accelerated back towards the parent ion after the field has changed its sign and can recombine along with the emission of an energetic photon .",
    "one prominent feature of hhg is that the emitted light has an intrinsic chirp , the so - called attochirp @xcite .",
    "the origin of the attochirp can be understood from the classical electron trajectories in the laser field : trajectories with different energies recollide at different times . due to the widespread classical recollision times in a usual sinusoidal laser field ,",
    "the emitted harmonic pulses have a longer duration than their bandwidth limit , that is the minimum pulse duration for a given spectral bandwidth reached when the spectral phase of the harmonic pulse is constant . to compress the emitted pulse , dispersive elements of",
    "either chirped multilayer x - ray mirrors @xcite , thin metallic films @xcite or gaseous media @xcite are employed and even the use of grating compressors is attempted @xcite .",
    "however , these techniques suffer from losses , rely on the material properties and the chirp is not well - controlable in these schemes .",
    "additionally , it is required to select radiation from the positively chirped short trajectory via phase - matching before the compensation element .",
    "other approaches @xcite try to exploit the reduced time window of recollision when increasing the wavelength of the driving laser at a constant bandwidth and field maximum . however , this way , it can not be taken advantage of the increased cutoff . without selection of a certain trajectory , it is possible to partially reduce the attochirp as shown in  @xcite by adding a weak second - harmonic or subharmonic field .",
    "the attochirp problem is expected to get more significant and demanding when photon energies spanning far into the soft x - ray domain are reached in the future .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a way to engineer the attochirp in a determined manner by altering the harmonic generation process . in terms of the wave function",
    ", the following scenario is realized : the wave function localized in the binding potential is continuously freed resulting in a large spread in space and momentum .",
    "the electronic quantum dynamics is tuned in a way that after a certain time of propagation , the wave function spatially re - compresses at least along the propagation direction of the wave packet .",
    "it has its minimum width exactly at the time of recollision but with a large energy bandwidth gained during propagation in the continuum .",
    "we show that when the laser pulse is shaped by adding a small number of low - order harmonics and employing soft x rays for ionization , attosecond pulses with arbitrary chirp can be formed including the possibility of attochirp - free hhg and bandwidth - limited attosecond pulses .",
    "the benefit of assisting the hhg process in a strong laser field with a weak high - frequency field has been demonstrated mainly for the purpose of enhancing the single - atom yield  @xcite , improving phase matching  @xcite or suppressing the relativistic drift  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "femtosecond pulse shaping has been used to shape the hhg spectrum  @xcite , to increase the hhg cutoff  @xcite or for relativistic hhg  @xcite . here",
    ", we employ x rays to ionize the electron with non - zero velocity and combine it with femtosecond pulse shaping to control the spectral phase of the harmonic spectrum .",
    "it is known @xcite that the hhg process can be analyzed by taking only a few quatum orbits into account that correspond to classical trajectories .",
    "therefore , a classical analysis is able to give first insight into our idea .",
    "in the first part of our paper , we start out by considering classical trajectories in a tailored laser field [ see fig .",
    "[ figopti ] ( a ) ] and find the condition when trajectories ionized at different times recollide at the same time . for the considered laser intensities , the classical trajectories have only a component along the polarization direction of the laser field , i.e. 1-dimensional trajectories are shown .",
    "we describe the principle of our method by discussing two example trajectories marked by @xmath3 and @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ figopti ] ( b ) being ionized separated by a small time span @xmath5 .",
    "we first focus on the point in time when trajectory @xmath4 just starts . at that time ,",
    "@xmath3 has already been driven slightly away from the origin .",
    "the distance between the trajectories is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an initial momentum e.g. mediated via one - photon - ionization ( atomic units are used throughout unless stated elsewise ) .",
    "the momentum difference at that time is given by @xmath8 because @xmath3 has already been decelerated by the laser field @xmath9 .",
    "from now on , the momentum difference @xmath10 is conserved during the whole propagation time .",
    "the separation of both trajectories at recollision after a time @xmath11 is therefore given by @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 reflects the condition on the initial momentum and on the electric field at ionization necessary for simultaneous recollision of the two trajectories : @xmath14        the previous discussion applies only to the case of two single trajectories ionized with an infinitely small time separation but is sufficient for demonstration of our principle idea of simultaneous recollision for trajectories ionized from a finite time window . in fig .",
    "[ figopti ] , we chose the simplest possible laser field to fulfill condition : a first plateau of strength @xmath9 and duration @xmath15 which is followed by a second higher plateau of duration @xmath16 . in this procedure , the field strength @xmath17 of the second plateau is chosen first .",
    "it determines @xmath11 for trajectories @xmath4 .",
    "then , the first plateau is found having a small slope determined by optimizing a polynomial expression to have simultaneous recollision of all classical trajectories ( approximately condition ) .",
    "crucial for the previous scheme is the ionization with a non - zero velocity .",
    "the condition can be reached by using x rays of frequency @xmath18 which are responsible for ionization . in this case , the initial momentum is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the binding potential .",
    "the x rays co - propagate with the laser field and are spectrally filtered out before the harmonic radiation reaches the detector .",
    "@xmath18 can be chosen in a way ( with the appropriate laser field according to eq . ) to meet a resonance of a suitable absorber at @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively , the x rays could propagate with a tiny angle to the propagation direction of the laser . in fig .",
    "[ figopti ] , we only consider trajectories ionized within @xmath15 and having a direction pointing upwards to the potential ( starting in positive direction in fig .",
    "[ figopti ] ) .",
    "the initial momentum could also be directed downwards but in this case , the classical electron would not recollide and no harmonics would be emitted .",
    "a second branch of trajectories that are ignored in the figure are those trajectories emerging from the second plateau during @xmath16 .",
    "they re - encounter the core region but all at different times and would break the desired scenario of simultaneous recollision .",
    "therefore , ionization during the second plateau has to be suppressed which demands for the use of an x - ray pulse [ sketched as red wiggeld line in fig .",
    "[ figopti ] ( a ) ] rather than a cw x - ray field .",
    "the x - ray pulse must have a non - vanishing field strength only during @xmath15 being of order of 1  fs .",
    "moreover , as medium , we choose a gas of ions because their high ionization potential is necessary to suppress tunnel ionization .",
    "the plasma could be generated via laser ionization with a strong pre - pulse .",
    "we briefly comment on the energy distribution of the recolliding trajectories .",
    "the classical trajectory marked by @xmath4 has a distinct role because it experiences approximately a constant laser field .",
    "therefore , it is symmetric to the turning point and also recollides with same momentum @xmath7 as it started .",
    "trajectories starting prior to @xmath4 recollide with a higher energy but at the same time as @xmath4 assuming the first plateau - like structure is chosen in agreement with eq .   as it is in fig .",
    "[ figopti ] .",
    "trajectory @xmath4 plays the role of the trajectory with the lowest energy @xmath18 .",
    "the duration of the first plateau @xmath15 determines the velocity difference @xmath21 and the energy bandwidth @xmath22 .    in the optimum case shown in fig .",
    "[ figopti ] , all trajectories recollide simultaneously .",
    "however , under real experimental conditions , deviations of the laser and x - ray field from the optimal conditions result in a non - zero time window @xmath23 of recollision .",
    "the classical model employed a discrete x - ray frequency @xmath18 rather than a finite bandwidth as a real pulse .",
    "the maximum allowed bandwidth can be deduced from the former model .",
    "the x rays ionize the electron with an initial velocity and arrange this way the initial displacement @xmath24 between two trajectories . if @xmath18 deviates from its optimal value by @xmath25 , the initial momentum will deviate by @xmath26 and result in a additional displacement @xmath27 which is not compensated for .",
    "therefore , the final wave packet size is of order @xmath28 resulting in a time spread of @xmath29 which has to be smaller than the envisaged pulse duration .",
    "so far , purely classical dynamics was considered . in order to model the single - atom hhg yield",
    ", we use the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) and include the laser field within the dipole approximation .",
    "this way , the fourier transformed dipole matrix element is given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ground state wave function of the employed zero - range potential , @xmath32 ^ 2/2+i_p\\}dt''+\\omega_x t'-q\\omega t$ ] the classical action and @xmath33 the harmonic number .",
    "in the long wavelength regime the highly oscillating integral can be evaluated by using the saddle - point approximation .",

    "is positive all saddle points are real and , therefore , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the ionization and recollision times , respectively , being also a solution of the classical equations of motion .",
    "we analyze the condition required for ( near- ) bandwidth - limited emission of high harmonics .",
    "the time - dependend intensity of the emitted light bursts is given by @xmath42 where the phase @xmath43 is crucial for the duration of the attosecond burst .",
    "we taylor - expanded @xmath44 about the central harmonic frequency @xmath45 .",
    "as outlined in @xcite the linear coefficient of the expansion , the group delay , is simply given by @xmath46 because the saddle - point equations lead to vanishing partial derivatives .",
    "the linear chirp , the group - delay dispersion ( gdd ) , is given by @xmath47 being in first approximation responsible for the duration of the harmonic pulse .",
    "hence , the pulse can be considered to be bandwidth - limited if the quadratic term in the taylor - expansion fulfills the following demand @xmath48 .",
    "this yields a criterion for the classical recollision time window @xmath23 resulting from the bandwidth of the trajectories : @xmath49 with the bandwidth - limited pulse duration @xmath50 and the parameter @xmath3 of order of unity determined by the spectrum .",
    "this reflects that only an approximate condition @xmath51 is necessary for bandwidth - limited hhg emission . in the previous section ,",
    "we discussed in detail how the condition of simultaneous recollision of classical trajectories @xmath51 can be fullfilled .",
    "we will show that it is sufficient to add only a few low - order fourier components of the fundamental laser frequency to the laser field in order to achieve an optimized field which fullfills eq .",
    "moreover , eq .  @xmath52 evidences that the chirp compensation becomes more difficult for larger bandwidth .    in our classical and quantum descriptions",
    ", we used the common assumption  @xcite of neglecting the x - ray field for the continuum propagation of the electron .",
    "this means dropping the term @xmath53\\;a_x(\\tau)/c+\\frac{1}{2}a_x^2(\\tau)/c^2)$ ] in the definition of @xmath54 .",
    "we derive an approximate condition for the maximum electric field strength of the x rays being allowed that this approximation holds and that the hhg pulse duration is not influenced by the x - ray field .",
    "when evaluating @xmath55 at the previously determined saddle points , the additional shift of the recollision times by the x - ray field is :    @xmath56\\;a_x(t_i)/c\\frac{\\partial t_i}{\\partial\\omega_q}\\approx - \\frac{e_x}{\\sqrt{\\omega_x}}\\frac{\\partial t_i}{\\partial\\omega_q}\\label{sxb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "we dropped the second term because @xmath57 is negligible due to the simultaneous recollision and the third term because it contains an integration over the heavily oscillating @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the overall additional recollision time spread @xmath59 has to be much smaller than the recollision time window to justify in our case the neglection of @xmath55 .    in summary",
    ", bandwidth - limited hhg emission can be reached when the recollision time window determined by the classical dynamics in the laser field fulfills eq .   and the x - ray field satisfies eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "in the following , we describe an implementation of the scheme .",
    "we start from an optimal field shape determined in the way described above with a fundamental frequency of @xmath60  a.u .",

    "the laser frequency is in all cases @xmath60  a.u .",

    "the pulses are almost bandwidth - limited as can be seen from the constant phase ( red dashed line ) in the main part of the pulse . here , the linear phase term given by the central frequency of the pulse was subtracted from the phase .    however , the photon yield emitted from the target is very low for several reasons : in the two examples , @xmath85 is valid because a much larger initial momentum is required , however , the ratio renders ionization inefficient .",
