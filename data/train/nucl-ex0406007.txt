    "qcd calculations predict a transition from ordinary hadronic matter into a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons at high energy density .",
    "dileptons , which have negligible final state interactions , represent a very suitable probe for the study of this new state of matter .",
    "the ceres / na45 experiment at the cern sps has made major contributions to the measurement of low - mass e@xmath3e@xmath4 pairs in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "ceres has measured an enhanced dilepton production in the invariant mass region @xmath5  0.2  gev / c@xmath6 in s+au at 200  agev @xcite and in pb+au at 158  agev @xcite and at 40  agev @xcite compared to the contribution from known hadronic sources .",
    "the enhancement is absent in p - induced reactions @xcite .",
    "pion annihilation has been taken into account as an additional mechanism for e@xmath3e@xmath4 production but the experimental spectra can not be explained without introducing medium modifications of vector mesons , particularly of the @xmath7 .",
    "the question of possible modifications of other vector mesons , specially of the @xmath8 and the @xmath1 , and the role of chiral symmetry restoration remained however open .    in order to further investigate the enhancement ,",
    "the ceres spectrometer was upgraded during 1998 by the addition of a time projection chamber ( tpc ) with radial electric drift field @xcite which improves the mass resolution and the electron identification . during the year 2000",
    "ceres took a large data sample consisting of 30@xmath9 and 3@xmath9 events of pb on au collisions at 158 agev triggered on the 8% and 20% most central collisions , respectively .",
    "the challenge was to calibrate the highly complex radial drift tpc to bring the momentum resolution to the design limit .",
    "the ceres experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) is optimized to measure low mass electron pairs close to mid - rapidity ( 2.1@xmath102.6 ) with full azimuthal coverage . a vertex telescope , composed of two silicon drift detectors ( sdd ) positioned at 10 cm and 13.8 cm downstream of a segmented au target , provides a precise vertex reconstruction , angle measurement for charged particles and rejection of close pairs from @xmath11 conversions and @xmath12 dalitz decays .",
    "two ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detectors , operated at a high threshold ( @xmath13=32 ) , are used for electron identification in a large hadronic background .",
    "the new radial - drift tpc , positioned downstream of the original spectrometer , has an active length of 2 m and a diameter of 2.6  m. a gas mixture of ne ( 80% ) and co@xmath14 ( 20% ) is used .",
    "it is operated inside a magnetic field ( @xmath15 , indicated by the dashed field lines inside the tpc in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) with a maximal radial component of 0.5 t and provides up to 20 space points for each charged particle track .",
    "this is sufficient for the momentum determination and for additional electron identification via d@xmath16/d@xmath17 in the tpc . in the configuration with the tpc ,",
    "the magnetic field between the two rich detectors is switched off and there is thus no deflection between them , allowing to use them in a combined mode resulting in an increased electron efficiency . moreover ,",
    "the tpc opens new possibilities to study hadronic observables  @xcite .",
    "one of the main tasks of the tpc calibration was to understand the electric field ( @xmath18 ) which is dominantly radial with @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 but has a small azimuthal component due to the polygonal shape of the tpc and small longitudinal components at the end caps . a custom program based on the relaxation method",
    "was developed for calculating the electric field including the proper knowledge of the field cage resistors , the field distortions caused by slightly displaced chambers and the leakage of the amplification field through the cathode wire plane .",
    "the magnetic field in the tpc is generated by two coils running with opposite currents ( fig.[fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the two main components @xmath22 and @xmath23 change with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "a field map was measured before the installation of the tpc in the experimental area .",
    "compared to the nominal magnetic field calculated with the poisson program the measured field deviates from azimuthal symmetry by a few % .",
    "these deviations are now included as corrections to the nominal field map .",
    "the electron mobility as a function of @xmath18 was determined from laser events containing tracks at known positions for a given set of gas parameters .",
    "relative run - by - run variations caused by changes in composition , temperature , and pressure ( monitored by the slow control system of the experiment ) are calculated with the magboltz program @xcite .",
    "the transformation from pad , time , and plane to the laboratory coordinate system ( @xmath17 , @xmath26 , and @xmath25 ) is done using a fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the drift trajectory is calculated starting at the cathode plane using in each point the drift velocity vector , @xmath27 where the components parallel to the electric field and parallel to ( @xmath28 ) have been modified to account for the difference observed between using @xmath29 from the above equation and the monte carlo drift option in the magboltz program @xcite . to fully account for the lorentz angle",
    "a correction is extracted from the symmetry of the 1/p distribution of identified pions under the assumption that very high momentum particles have vanishing curvature .",
    "after all these corrections the local distortions are small compared to the resolution .",
    "the momentum of tracks from the target is determined from the combination ( resolution - weighted ) of a 3-parameter fit that takes into account multiple scattering before the tpc ( dominant for low - momentum particles ) and a 2-parameter fit that assumes that tracks come from the vertex ( dominant for high - momentum particles ) .",
    "the momentum resolution depends on the number of hits on a track and on the single - hit position resolution .",
    "new hit finding and track finding algorithms were developed to better resolve close hits and to improve tracking efficiency at very low momenta .",
    "tracks above 1  gev / c momentum are found with an efficiency of 90% due to non instrumented areas and have an average number of hits of 18.7 .",
    "down to a momentum of 0.3  gev / c the efficiency is still 80% and the average number of hits is 17.2 . the single - hit position resolution is obtained comparing the reconstructed hit positions with the ideal hit positions given by the fitted trajectory of a track .",
    "the width of the residual distribution gives the spatial resolution .",
    "the resolution in azimuthal direction scaled with the radius @xmath24 of the hit ( @xmath30 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ka0 ] .",
    "it deteriorates slightly with increasing hit multiplicity in the tpc .",
    "the momentum resolution has also been evaluated using a microscopic drift monte carlo simulation with single - point resolution as observed in the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ka0 ] ) .",
    "it translates into a mass resolution of about 4% at the @xmath1 meson mass reconstructed in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "the momentum resolution was checked in the data by looking at the width of the reconstructed @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the invariant - mass spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ka0 ] ) .",
    "the detailed calibration improves the mass resolution by at least a factor 1.7 compared to the old calibration @xcite .",
    "the pad - to - pad gain calibration is obtained from the total hit amplitude in the pad of maximum amplitude .",
    "a correction of the undershoot after each pulse obtained from non - zero suppressed data was included @xcite .",
    "an electron attachment correction is determined by analysing the dependence of the hit amplitude on the drift length and taking into account the different particle abundancies for each polar angle @xmath33 .",
    "the d@xmath16/dx of a track is calculated as the truncated mean of",
    "the individual hit amplitudes .",
    "for the maximum number of hits on tracks the d@xmath16/dx resolution approaches the parameterization by allison and cobb ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dedx ] ) , which implies that most of the electrons in this analysis are measured with d@xmath16/dx resolution of better than 10% .",
    "the main difficulties of the electron analysis are the low probability of electromagnetic decays and the large amount of combinatorial background from @xmath11 conversions and dalitz decays .",
    "to select electrons among all charged hadrons the rich detectors and the d@xmath16/dx signal in the tpc are used .",
    "the analysis chain provides track segments in the different detectors .",
    "the two rich detectors are used in a combined mode in this analysis .",
    "rings with asymptotic radius and a ( double hough ) amplitude above a given threshold for the full ring acceptance ( slowly decreasing threshold towards the edges ) are taken as rich track segments . with these cuts a pion rejection of about 0.999 is achieved for an electron efficiency of about 0.55 .",
    "quality cuts ( matching between sdd1/2 of 2 mrad and at least 12 hits in the tpc track segments ) are applied .",
    "global tracks are constructed by combining track segments in sdd , tpc and rich with a 2@xmath34 momentum - dependent matching window .",
    "the electron d@xmath16/dx signal in the tpc is independent of momentum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dedx ] ) .",
    "a primary electron selection is done based on the d@xmath16/dx resolution .",
    "finally a more restricted cut to further suppress pions is applied ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dedx ] ) .    very good electron identification is not enough .",
    "electron pairs from @xmath11 conversions and @xmath12 dalitz decays need to be identified by topology and removed from the sample to reduce combinatorial background .",
    "they are characterized by their small opening angle and low momentum .",
    "as the detectors have a finite two - track resolution the most effective way of rejecting conversions in the target and close dalitz pairs is by rejecting tracks with at least twice the minimum ionizing energy loss signal in both sdd s where all hit amplitudes have been re - summed within 7 mrad around the each sdd track segment .",
    "low - amplitude tails in the sdd d@xmath16/dx distribution are also removed .",
    "late conversions ( mostly in sdd1 ) are removed by an upper cut in each rich ring amplitude and by a cut in the distance to another tpc track of opposite sign and electron d@xmath16/dx .",
    "r6.5 cm [ fig : fullrejectmix ]    to reduce @xmath12 dalitz decay contributions only electron tracks with no opposite charge electron track within 35 mrad are taken for analysis .",
    "finally , only electron tracks in the geometrical acceptance 0.14  rad  @xmath35  0.243 rad and with a @xmath36  0.2  gev / c are selected .",
    "the invariant - mass distributions of unlike - sign pairs and of like - sign pairs that is a measure of the combinatorial background after full rejection are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullrejectmix ] . in order to reduce the statistical errors an unlike - sign combinatorial background using the mixed - event technique",
    "has also been evaluated . for masses below 0.2",
    "gev / c@xmath6 , the mixed - event background deviates from the like - sign background due to ring reconstruction effects ; the mixed - event background is normalized to the like - sign pair background in the mass region 0.2  gev / c@xmath37m@xmath380.6  gev / c@xmath6 .",
    "the physics signal is obtained by subtracting the like - sign pairs or the mixed event background from the unlike - sign pairs as @xmath39 .",
    "this analysis is based on about @xmath40 events corresponding aproximately to 80% of the events where both rich detectors were operational .",
    "the preliminary e@xmath3e@xmath4 invariant - mass spectrum normalized to the @xmath12 dalitz peak of the hadronic decay cocktail is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fullreject ] .",
    "the hadron decay cocktail @xcite has been folded with the experimental momentum resolution and energy loss due to bremsstrahlung .",
    "acceptance , opening - angle , and transverse - momentum cuts are applied .",
    "an excess of pairs for m@xmath41 0.2  gev/@xmath42 is visible .    using the like - sign background ,",
    "the number of pairs in the dalitz region ( m@xmath38  0.2  gev / c@xmath6 ) is 2826  @xmath43  114 with a signal to background ratio ( s / b ) of 1/1.78 .",
    "using the mixed - event background , the number of open pairs ( m@xmath41  0.2  gev / c@xmath6 ) is 2023  @xmath43  182 with a s / b of 1/14.6 .",
    "the enhancement factor for 0.2  gev / c@xmath6@xmath44 m@xmath45@xmath441.1  gev / c@xmath6 compared to the hadron decay cocktail is 3.1 @xmath43 0.3 ( stat ) .",
    "further optimization of cuts based on monte carlo simulations is in progress and is expected to improve the statistical errors .",
    "the experimental results are compared to theoretical models based on hadronic decays and @xmath46 annihilation .",
    "the @xmath7-propagator is treated @xcite in 3 ways : vacuum @xmath7 , modifications following brown - rho scaling @xcite , and modifications via @xmath7-hadron interactions @xcite .",
    "the data clearly disfavour the vacuum @xmath7 . in the region between the @xmath8 and the @xmath1",
    "the data seem to favour the many - body approach over brown - rho scaling .",
    "we have to await the final results of the analysis before a stronger statement can be made .",
    "one of the open issues at the cern sps is the @xmath1 puzzle .",
    "two experiments , one measuring the @xmath1 meson in the @xmath47 @xmath48 decay channel ( na50 ) , and the other ( na49 ) , measuring it in the @xmath2 channel , obtain yields that differ by factors between 2 and 4 in the common @xmath49 range @xcite .",
    "further , the @xmath49 spectra exhibit a different inverse slope parameter @xcite , 305@xmath4315 mev in na49 and 218 @xmath43 6 mev in na50 , fitted in their @xmath49 acceptance regions .",
    "we have compared our preliminary mass spectrum with a calculated spectrum based on a @xmath1-yield as predicted in a thermal model @xcite which also describes the na50 yield ( left of fig .  [ fig : phi_ele ] ) .",
    "the lines also contain the @xmath7-contribution . within a window of @xmath50 around the @xmath1",
    "peak the ratio of data to simulation is 1.1  @xmath43  0.3 . with an additional electron pair @xmath51 cut of 300 mev / c ( right of fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_ele ] ) the ratio is 1.2  @xmath43  0.3 .",
    "obviously this is in very good agreement with our data . reducing the @xmath1-yield to 50% of the above value ( dashed lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_ele ] ) leads to a ratio of 1.9  @xmath43  0.5 and 2.1  @xmath43  0.6 .",
    "the reduced yield that would agree with the na49 observation for @xmath52 seems in disagreement with our preliminary data .",
    "the evaluation of absolute efficiencies and systematic errors are needed to draw a definitive conclusion .",
    "the upgraded spectrometer offers the unique possibility to study simultaneously the @xmath1 meson in the @xmath2 decay channel . to study this channel ,",
    "we assign to all charged particles the kaon mass ( no particle identification ) .",
    "tpc tracks in the geometrical acceptance 0.14  rad @xmath53  0.24  rad with at least 12 hits and with a transverse momentum @xmath54  gev / c that are matched to a sdd track within 2.5@xmath34 momentum - dependent matching window are used .",
    "the combinatorial background is calculated using the mixed - event technique .",
    "an opening - angle cut of 0.015  rad  @xmath55  0.17  rad is applied to improve the signal - to - background ratio . a cut @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the podolanski - armenteros parameter @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the decay track momentum component parallel ( transverse ) to the @xmath1 momentum in the laboratory frame , is also applied to avoid contamination from other particles species .",
    "the signal is studied for @xmath61 gev / c and rapidity 2.0 @xmath62 2.4 .",
    "acceptance and pair reconstruction efficiency corrections are obtained from geant simulations where @xmath1 decays with a distribution in transverse momentum @xmath63 and a gaussian rapidity distribution with a standard deviation of 1.2 are embedded into the background of real events .    the preliminary invariant mass spectrum after background subtraction and the transverse momentum spectra corrected for efficiency and acceptance are presented in fig .  [ fig : phi_ka ] .",
    "the values of the inverse slope parameter obtained after fitting with the function given above are t=218@xmath4312 mev and t=246@xmath4322 mev for the rapidity intervals 2.0@xmath44y@xmath442.2 and 2.2@xmath44y@xmath442.4 , respectively .",
