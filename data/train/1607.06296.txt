    "the discovery of quasars at redshifts @xmath3 @xcite suggests that @xmath4 supermassive black holes emerged only @xmath5 myr after the big bang , and only @xmath6 myr beyond the formation of population ii and population iii stars @xcite .",
    "such large aggregates of matter constitute an enduring mystery in astronomy because these quasars could not have formed so quickly in @xmath1cdm without an anomalously high accretion rate @xcite and/or the creation of unusually massive seeds @xcite ; neither of these has actually ever been observed .",
    "for example , @xcite have recently demonstrated that no known high-@xmath7 quasar accretes at more than @xmath8 times the eddington rate ( see figure  5 in their paper ; see also melia 2014 ) .",
    "this paper will feature two specific cosmologies  the aforementioned @xmath1cdm ( the ` standard , ' or concordance model ) and another friedmann - robertson - walker solution known as the @xmath2 universe @xcite .",
    "our focus will be to explain the luminosity function of these quasars , particularly as they evolve towards lower redshifts .",
    "part of the motivation for this comparative study is that , unlike @xmath1cdm , the @xmath2 model does not suffer from the time compression problem alluded to above @xcite . in this cosmology ,",
    "cosmic reionization ( starting with the creation of population iii stars ) lasted from @xmath9 myr to @xmath10 gyr ( @xmath11 ) , so @xmath12 black hole seeds formed ( presumably during supernova explosions ) shortly after reionization had begun , would have evolved into @xmath13 quasars by @xmath14 simply via the standard eddington - limited accretion rate .",
    "the @xmath2 universe has thus far passed all such tests based on a broad range of cosmological observations , but already , this consistency with the age - redshift relationship implied by the early evolution of supermassive black holes suggests that an optimization of the quasar luminosity function might serve as an additional powerful discriminator between these two competing expansion scenarios . the class of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs )",
    "is ideally suited for this purpose .",
    "fsrqs are bright active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that belong to a subcategory of blazars .",
    "these represent the most extreme class of agns , whose radiation towards earth is dominated by the emission in a relativistic jet closely aligned with our line - of - sight .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0-ray emission from these sources was an important confirmation of the prediction by @xcite that the particle dynamics in these jets ought to be associated with significant high - energy emission along small viewing angles with respect to the jet axis .",
    "it is still an open question exactly what powers the jet activity , but it is thought that the incipient energy is probably extracted from the black hole s spin , and is perhaps also related to the accretion luminosity .",
    "major mergers might have enhanced the black - hole growth rate and activity , which would have occurred more frequently in the early universe . in this context",
    ", the blazar evolution may be connected with the cosmic evolution of the black - hole spin distribution , jet activity and major merger events themselves , all of which may be studied via the luminosity function ( lf ) and its evolution with redshift .    recently , _",
    "the fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ has detected hundreds of blazars from low redshifts out to z = 3.1 , thanks to its high sensitivity @xcite .",
    "based on the previous analysis of the fsrq @xmath0-ray luminosity function ( glf ) , it is already clear that the glf evolution is positive up to a redshift cut - off that depends on the luminosity ( see , e.g. , padovani et al .",
    "2007 ; ajello et al . 2009 ; ajello et al . 2012 ) . but",
    "all previous work with this sample ignored a very important ingredient to this discussion  the impact on the glf evolution with redshift from the assumed cosmological expansion itself .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to carry out a comparative analysis of the standard @xmath1cdm and @xmath15 models using the most up - to - date sample of 408 fsrqs detected by the _ fermi_-lat over its four - year survey .",
    "we wish to examine the influence on the results due to the assumed background cosmology and , more importantly , we wish to demonstrate that the current sample of @xmath0-ray emitting fsrqs is already large enough for us to carry out meaningful cosmological testing . throughout this paper , we will be directly comparing the flat @xmath1cdm cosmology with @xmath16 and @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 , based on the latest _ planck _ results @xcite , and the @xmath2 universe , whose sole parameter  the hubble constant ",
    "will for simplicity be assumed to have the same value as that in @xmath1cdm .",
    "we will demonstrate that these data already emphatically favour @xmath2 over @xmath1cdm , even without an optimization of @xmath19 for @xmath2 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in   2 , we will summarize the observational data , specifically the 3fgl catalog @xcite , and describe how the @xmath0-ray luminosity is determined for each specific model .",
    "  3 will provide an account of the critical differences between these two cosmologies that directly impact the calculation of the glf , and we discuss the currently preferred ansatz for this luminosity function based on the most recent analysis of these data in   4 .",
    "we present and discuss our results in   5 , and conclude in ",
    "the third fermi large area telescope source catalog ( 3fgl ) provided by @xcite lists 3,303 sources detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat during its four years of operation .",
    "these data include the source location and its spectral properties .",
    "a subset of these is the third lat agn catalog ( 3lac ; ackermann et al .",
    "2015 ) , containing 1,591 agns of various types located at high galactic latiude , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "most of the detected agns are blazars , which consist of 467 fsrqs , 632 bl lacs , 460 blazar candidates of uncertain type ( bcus ) , and 32 non - blazar agns . removing the entries in 3lac for which the corresponding @xmath0-ray sources were not associated with agns , had more than one counterpart or were flagged for other reasons in the analysis",
    ", @xcite reduced the agn catalog to a ` clean ' sample of 1,444 sources , including 414 fsrqs , 604 bl lacs , 402 bcus and 24 non - blazar agns .",
    "the energy flux distribution of all the _ fermi _ sources may be seen in figure  18 of @xcite .",
    "the flux threshold in 3fgl is @xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath18 , lower than the value ( @xmath23 erg @xmath22 s@xmath18 ) in 2fgl and ( @xmath24 erg @xmath22 s@xmath18 ) in 1fgl .",
    "the sample above the 3fgl flux threshold is essentially complete ( see figure  18 of acero et al .",
    "note also that all of the fsrqs cataloged in 3fgl have measured redshifts . in this paper , we have chosen to use only the fsrqs from 3lac , and not the bl lacs , because of their greater redshift coverage and better sample completeness , both of which strengthen our statistical analysis .    our sample is therefore comprised of the 414 fsrqs detected by _ fermi _ with a test statistic ( ts ) @xmath25 and latitude @xmath26 .",
    "their @xmath0-ray fluxes @xmath27 and photon indices @xmath28 in the energy range 0.1 gev - 100 gev are obtained from 3fgl ] and their redshifts are from table 7 of @xcite . ]",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath29 of an fsrq using the expression : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the luminosity distance at redshift @xmath7 and @xmath32 is the @xmath33correction for the observed fluxes using @xmath34 . the corresponding photon flux @xmath35 ( in units of photons @xmath22 s@xmath18 ) in the 0.1 gev - 100 gev energy band used in this paper is readily obtained from the following expressions ( see , e.g. , ghisellini et al . 2009 , singal et al . 2014 ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 erg ( corresponding to 0.1 gev ) is the lower energy limit .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in this paper",
    ", we have provided a compelling confirmation of these other results by demonstrating that population studies , though featuring a strong evolution in redshift , may also be used to independently check the outcome of model comparisons based purely on geometric considerations .",
    "we emphasize , however , that much work still needs to be done to properly identify how to best characterize the number density function for this type of analysis . this would be critically important in cases , unlike @xmath1cdm and @xmath2 , where cosmological models are so different that an appropriate common ansatz may be difficult to find .",
