    "the study of ballistic electron transport in nano - devices has been an interesting field of research.@xcite recently , a si nanowire with a length comparable to the de broglie wavelength of carriers is realized by advanced nanofabrication technique.@xcite the cross - sectional area of si nanowires was designed to show well - separated transverse modes and electrons confined to the wire are expected to suffer from a minimal amount of impurity scattering .",
    "these properties make the si nanowires good candidates for the study of ballistic quantum transport .",
    "in addition , the potential distribution within the wire can be controllable by a metallic gate around the wire .",
    "this provides additional degree - of freedom on currents through the device and one would expect that the basic transistor action is possible for a si nanowire . as a result ,",
    "the gate - all - around si wire may shed the light on one - dimensional structures for future transistor applications .",
    "it is desirable experimentally to make the si wires as intrinsic as possible .",
    "however , to populate the wires with carriers , it is necessary to define source and drain regions where ionized dopants are placed .",
    "these dopants scatter free carriers and the elastic impurity scattering can not be avoided in those regions .",
    "thus , in order to understand transport in the wires , a quantitative treatment of the ionized impurity scattering will be important .",
    "several theoretical works were done to investigate the effects of ionized - impurity scattering on one - dimensional electron gas , and revealed their effects on the electronic structure .",
    "most of these studies were for uniformly doped or remote - impurity systems@xcite and adopted empirical models based on the so - called bttiker probes for simulating the device.@xcite the empirical methods are appealing due to relatively simple implementation but the methods often require parameters that need to be adjusted using more rigorous calculations or values from experiments .    in this work ,",
    "we take into account the ionized impurity scattering in simulating the gate - all - around nanowire using non - equilibrium green s function approach . by averaging the green s function over impurity configurations and expanding the arising term perturbatively",
    ", we treat the impurity scattering within a self - consistent born approximation and apply the formula to the si nanowire as realized in ref . @xcite .",
    "since the impurity - scattering strength is a single parameter for the system , the method provides the first - principle approach to understand current - voltage characteristics and compare them with the experimental results .",
    "to see the effects of the impurity scattering clearly , we consider a simple geometry of a quantum wire as in fig .",

    "an infinitely - long cylindrical si wire consists of intrinsic channel and heavily doped source and drain regions .",

    "we plot a schematic diagram of a cylindrical si wire simulated in this work which is oriented along the [ 001 ] direction . the si wire surrounded with the gate",

    "@xmath13 describes the impurity potential energy from the ionized dopants . in this work , we assume that the impurity potentials are short - ranged but still vary slowly in the atomic scale . as a result , different valley modes are not coupled by the impurity potential and can be solved independently .    since the device has the circular symmetry , it is convenient to express the hamiltonian in terms of the basis diagonalizing the radial motion .",

    "we consider a number of impurity configurations rather than a particular distribution , and average the green s functions over the configurations .",

    ", we follow the conventional approach where the device is partitioned into the system being in non - equilibrium and reservoirs.@xcite since the source and drain regions are extended semi - infinitely , we confine our attention to the portion of the system near the gate where physical properties are thought to be deviated from those of deep source and drain regions .",
    "we designate the portion by longitudinal indices @xmath50 .",

    "we assume that the self - energy @xmath32 is independent of longitudinal coordinates @xmath55 because they are sufficiently far from the gate region where the potential distribution is uneven . within this assumption ,",

    "after various numerical calculations , we find that @xmath106 is well represented by ; @xmath107 where a node @xmath108 is the middle point in the intrinsic si wire .",

    "regardless of the impurity scattering , they exhibit source - channel barriers .",
    "since a high gate voltage lowers the energy barriers , the basic transistor action is achieved by controlling these barriers.@xcite    the energy - resolved particle density is plotted in a gray scale ; a darker area in the figure represents higher density . in the impurity - free case of @xmath121 ,",
    "since there is no momentum relaxation , states injected from the drain(source ) end of the device undergo reflections and interfere strongly to the right(left ) of the source - to - channel barrier .",
    "this interference results in coherent oscillations in the particle density as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2]-(a ) . as a function of energy",
    ", it is found that the local particle density far from the source - channel barrier shows sharp peaks like @xmath129 at every onset of subbands , reminiscence of one - dimensional density of states .",

    "above all , this makes the interference oscillations washed out in the local particle density as shown in fig . [ fig2]-(b ) .",
    "in addition , electronic states are shifted and broaden , so that the most electrons are found below subband bottoms and it s occupation has no longer @xmath129-dependence , but a monotonically varying function(the abrupt change of darkness along the energy direction comes from a different valley state ) . in both cases of the impurity scattering , one can see that electrons in the source and drain regions are well separated by the source - channel barriers from each other . due to this , the approximation of eq .",

    "[ figidvg]-(a ) and ( b ) , respectively , with and without impurity scattering for several temperatures . under this condition , currents exhibit rapidly increasing behavior as a gate voltage becomes larger .",
    "this shows the basic operation of a transistor as indicated in the previous section ; the channel current turns on by lowing the source - channel barrier when a gate voltage is higher than a certain value , called a threshold voltage @xmath137 .    by comparing figs . [ figidvg]-(a ) and ( b ) at a given temperature , one can find that the presence of impurities reduces the currents significantly even though electrons in both cases are expected to move ballistically in the intrinsic gate region .",
    "this indicates that transport through the si wire largely depends on the electronic structure of the source and drain regions .",
    "as inspired by flat subbands in the figures , the potential drops across the intrinsic regions are nearly invariant to the impurity scattering strength .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that the suppressed currents do not come from the fermi - dirac matrix of eq .",
    "( [ ids ] ) which crucially depends on the potential drop , but mainly from a reduced transmission coefficient of eq .",
    "( [ tcoeff ] ) .",
    "one of possible explanations for this is that electrons injected from the source are partially reflected from impurities in the source extension in addition to that from the source - channel barriers and , thus electrons tunnel the source - channel barrier at rare intervals .",
    "this type of the reduction for the transmission coefficient is also encountered in problems of tunneling in dissipative environments.@xcite according to the theories , when environments of the device become more dissipative , carriers are harder to tunnel the barriers because more energies should be transferred to the environment .    as a function of a temperature ,",
    "curves are shifted with wholly similar shapes and slightly different slopes in both cases of the impurity scattering .",
    "two points are noteworthy .",
    "firstly , the threshold voltage is shifted to a higher value as a temperature is lowered .",
    "this is easily understood because as the temperature decreases , available electrons to overcome source - to - channel barrier thermally are reduced and then more potential energy should be supplied electrostatically to turn on currents .",
    "secondly , we look at the slopes of the @xmath130-@xmath136 curves . in conventional mosfets",
    ", they are related to a channel mobility @xmath138 via a relation of @xmath139 . as seen in the figures ,",
    "our results show linear behavior in some range of gate voltages .",

    ". calculated currents and conductances are also presented as functions of temperature and the impurity scattering strength .",
    "it is found that the conductance of a si wire exhibits various behavior by decreasing temperature , which interpolate from a linear increasing function at a zero scattering to an exponentially decreasing function for the strong scattering case .",
    "however , in this work , we do not include other inelastic scattering process such as acoustic and optical phonon scattering which will be occurred in real devices .",
    "therefore , our results show the effects of the ionized impurity scattering alone on electronic transport through a si wire .    25    t. j. thornton , m. pepper , h. ahmed , d. andrews , and g. j. davies , phys .",
