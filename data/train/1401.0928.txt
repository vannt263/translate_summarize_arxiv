    "double - diffusive instabilities commonly occur in any astrophysical fluid that is stable according to the ledoux criterion , as long as the entropy and chemical stratifications have opposing contributions to the dynamical stability of the system .",
    "they drive weak forms of convection described below , and can cause substantial heat and compositional mixing in circumstances reviewed in this paper .",
    "two cases can be distinguished . in _ fingering convection _ , entropy is stably stratified ( @xmath0 , but chemical composition is unstably stratified @xmath1 ; it is often referred to as _ thermohaline _ convection by analogy with the oceanographic context in which the instability was first discovered . in _",
    "oscillatory double - diffusive convection _",
    "( oddc ) , entropy is unstably stratified ( @xmath2 , but chemical composition is stably stratified @xmath3 ; it is related to semiconvection , but can occur even when the opacity is independent of composition .    fingering convection can naturally occur at late stages of stellar evolution , notably in giants , but also in main sequence stars that have been polluted by planetary infall ( as first proposed by vauclair , @xcite ) , or by material transferred from a more evolved companion star .",
    "oddc on the other hand is naturally found in stars in the vicinity of convective nuclear - burning regions , including high - mass core - burning main sequence or red clump stars , and shell - burning rgb and agb stars .",
    "it is also thought to be common in the interior of giant planets that have been formed through the core - accretion scenario .",
    "beyond competing entropy and compositional gradients , a necessary condition for double - diffusive instabilities to occur is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the microscopic compositional and thermal diffusivities ) .",
    "this is usually the case in astrophysical fluids , where @xmath7 is typically _ much _ smaller than one owing to the added contribution of photon and electron transport to the thermal diffusivity .",
    "the somewhat counter - intuitive manner in which a high thermal diffusivity can be destabilizing is illustrated in figure [ fig : instab ] . in the fingering case , a small @xmath7 ensures that any small displaced fluid element rapidly adjusts to the ambient temperature of its new position , while retaining its original composition .",
    "an element displaced downward thus finds itself denser than the surrounding fluid and continues to sink ; the opposite occurs for an element displaced upward . in the case of oddc",
    ", thermal diffusion can progressively amplify any internal gravity wave passing through , by heating a fluid element at the lowest position of its displacement and cooling it near the highest . in both cases ,",
    "the efficient development of the instability is conditional on the fluid element being small enough for thermal diffusion to take place .",
    "double - diffusive convection is therefore a process driven on very small scales , usually orders of magnitude smaller than a pressure scaleheight .",
    "consequently , a common way of studying fingering and odd convection is by a _ local _ linear stability analysis , in which the background gradients of entropy ( related to @xmath8 ) and composition @xmath9 are approximated as being constant ( baines & gill , @xcite ) .",
    "the governing equations in the boussinesq approximation are then : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the non - dimensional velocity field , pressure , temperature and mean molecular weight perturbations of the fluid around the background state , pr@xmath15 is the prandtl number ( and @xmath16 is the viscosity ) , and @xmath17 is called the _ density ratio_. here the unit lengthscale used is the typical horizontal scale @xmath18 of the basic instability , the unit time is @xmath19 , the unit temperature is @xmath20 and the unit compositional perturbation is @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 sign in the temperature and composition equations should be used to model fingering convection , while the @xmath23 sign should be used to model oddc .",
    "mathematically speaking , this sign change is the only difference between the two processes .",
    "assuming perturbations have a spatio - temporal structure of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is either one of the dependent variables , @xmath26 is the wavenumber of the perturbation and @xmath27 its growth rate ( which could be complex ) , @xmath27 satisfies a cubic equation : @xmath28 \\lambda   + \\left [ k^6 { \\rm pr } \\tau \\pm l^2 { \\rm pr } ( \\tau - r_0^{-1 } )   \\right ] = 0 \\mbox {   , } \\nonumber \\label{eq : cubic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 again refers to @xmath22 for fingering convection and @xmath23 for oddc , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the norm of the horizontal component of @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is real in the case of fingering convection but complex in the case of oddc , as expected from the physical description of the mechanism driving the instability .",
    "the fastest growing mode in both cases is vertically invariant .",
    "its growth rate @xmath32 and horizontal wavenumber @xmath33 can be obtained by maximizing @xmath34 over all possible @xmath26 .",
    "finally , setting @xmath35 identifies marginal stability , and reveals the parameter range for double - diffusive instabilities to be:@xmath36 note that @xmath37 in both cases corresponds to the ledoux criterion .",
    "while linear theory is useful to identify _ when _ double - diffusive convection occurs , nonlinear calculations are needed to determine how the latter saturates , and how much mixing it causes .",
    "vertical mixing is often measured via non - dimensional vertical fluxes , called nusselt numbers .",
    "the temperature and compositional nusselt numbers are defined here as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the dimensional temperature and compositional turbulent fluxes .",
    "to reconstruct the dimensional _ total _ fluxes of heat and composition @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we have ( wood , @xcite ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath45 is the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath46 can also be interpreted as the ratio of the effective to microscopic compositional diffusivities .    direct numerical simulations , which solve the fully nonlinear set of equations ( [ eq : goveqs ] ) for given parameter values pr , @xmath7 and @xmath47 from the onset of instability onward , can in principle be run to estimate the functions @xmath48 and nu@xmath49 .",
    "however , the actual nonlinear behavior of double - diffusive systems reveals a number of surprises , that must be adequately studied before a complete theory for mixing can be put forward .",
    "it has long been known in oceanography that double - diffusive convection has a tendency to drive the growth of structures on scales much larger than that of the basic instability ( cf .",
    "stern , @xcite ) .",
    "this tendency was recently confirmed in the astrophysical context as well ( rosenblum , @xcite ; brown , @xcite ) .",
    "these structures either take the form of large - scale internal gravity waves or thermo - compositional staircases , as shown in figure [ fig : large - scale ] .    , @xmath50 .",
    "the basic instability first saturates into a near - homogeneous state of turbulence , but later develops large - scale gravity waves .",
    "bottom : oddc simulation for pr = @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the basic instability first saturates into a near - homogeneous state , but later develops into a thermo - compositional staircase , whose steps gradually merge until only one is left .",
    "the mean nusselt numbers increase somewhat in the presence of waves in the fingering case , and quite significantly when the staircase forms , and at each merger , in the oddc case .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    for density ratios close to one , fingering convection tends to excite large - scale gravity waves , through a process called the _ collective instability _ first discovered by stern ( @xcite ) .",
    "these waves grow to significant amplitudes , and enhance mixing by fingering convection when they break .",
    "the same is true for oddc , but the latter can sometimes also form thermo - compositional staircases excited by a process called the @xmath53_instability _ ( radko , @xcite ) .",
    "the staircases spontaneously emerge from the homogeneously turbulent state , and appear as a stack of fully convective , well - mixed regions ( the layers ) separated by thin strongly stratified interfaces .",
    "the layers have a tendency to merge rather rapidly after they form .",
    "vertical mixing increases significantly when layers form , and with each merger .    for these reasons",
    ", quantifying transport by double - diffusive convection requires understanding not only how and at what amplitude the basic small - scale instabilities saturates , but also under which circumstances large - scale structures may emerge and how the latter affect mixing .",
    "given their ubiquity in fingering and odd convection , it is natural to seek a unified explanation for the emergence of large - scale structures that is applicable to both regimes .",
    "mean - field hydrodynamics is a natural way to proceed , as it can capitalize on the separation of scales between the primary instability and the gravity waves or staircases .    to understand how mean - field instabilities can be triggered , first note that the intensity of vertical mixing in double - diffusive convection is naturally smaller if the system is closer to being stable , and vice - versa .",
    "if a homogeneously turbulent state is spatially modulated by large - scale ( but small amplitude ) perturbations in temperature or chemical composition , then vertical mixing will be more efficient in regions where the _ local _ density ratio is closer to one , and smaller in regions where it is further from one . the spatial convergence or divergence of these turbulent fluxes can , under the right conditions , enhance the initial perturbations in a positive feedback loop , in which case a mean - field instability occurs .",
    "first discussed separately in oceanography , the collective and @xmath54-instabilities were later discovered to be different unstable modes of the same mean - field equations by traxler  ( @xcite ) , in the context of fingering convection .",
    "their work has successfully been extended to explain the emergence of thermo - compositional layers in oddc in astrophysical systems by mirouh  ( @xcite ) .",
    "a formal stability analysis of the mean - field equations shows that they are unstable to the @xmath53instability ( the layering instability ) whenever the _ flux ratio _ @xmath55 is a _ decreasing _ function of @xmath47 ( radko , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , a necessary condition for the collective instability was given by stern  ( @xcite ) , who argued that large - scale gravity waves can develop whenever @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "this criterion is often much less restrictive than the one for the development of the @xmath53instability .",
    "note that @xmath58 and @xmath46 in ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : a ] ) are the nusselt numbers associated with the small - scale turbulence present _ before _ any large - scale structure has emerged .",
    "traxler  ( @xcite ) were the first to run a systematic sweep of parameter space to study fingering convection in astrophysics , and to measure @xmath48 and @xmath59 in 3d numerical experiments .",
    "however , they were not able to achieve very low values of pr and @xmath7 .",
    "brown  ( @xcite ) later presented new simulations with pr and @xmath7 as low as @xmath60 , but this is still orders of magnitude larger than in stellar interiors , where pr and @xmath7 typically range from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .    to bridge",
    "the gap between numerical experiments and stellar conditions , brown  ( @xcite ) derived a compelling semi - analytical prescription for transport by small - scale fingering convection , that reproduces their numerical results and can be extrapolated to much lower pr and @xmath7 .",
    "their model attributes the saturation of the fingering instability to the development of shearing instabilities between adjacent fingers ( see also denissenkov , @xcite and radko & smith , @xcite ) . for a given set of governing parameters pr , @xmath7 and @xmath47 , the growth rate and horizontal wavenumber of the fastest - growing fingers can be calculated from linear theory ( see section [ sec : linear ] ) . meanwhile ,",
    "the growth rate @xmath63 of shearing instabilities developing between neighboring fingers is proportional to the velocity of the fluid within the finger times its wavenumber ( a result that naturally emerges from dimensional analysis , but can also be shown formally using floquet theory ) . stating that shearing instabilities can disrupt the continued growth of fingers requires @xmath63 and @xmath32 to be of the same order .",
    "this sets the velocity within the finger to be @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a universal constant of order one .",
    "meanwhile , linear stability theory also relates the temperature and compositional fluctuations @xmath13 and @xmath14 within a finger to @xmath66 .",
    "the turbulent fluxes can thus be estimated _ only using linear theory _ :",
    "@xmath67 comparison of these formula with the data helps calibrate @xmath65 .",
    "brown  ( @xcite ) found that using @xmath68 can very satisfactorily reproduce most of their data within a factor of order one or better , except when pr @xmath69 ( which is rarely the case in stellar interiors anyway ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : nusfinger ] ) implies that for low pr and @xmath7 , turbulent heat transport is negligible , while turbulent compositional transport is significant only when @xmath47 is close to one .",
    "however , the values of @xmath46 obtained by brown  ( @xcite ) are still not large enough to account for the mixing rates required by charbonnel & zahn ( @xcite ) to explain surface abundances in giants .",
    "such large values of @xmath70 might on the other hand be achieved if mean - field instabilities take place .      as discussed in section [ sec : large ] , one simply needs to estimate @xmath54 and @xmath71 in order to determine in which parameter regime mean - field instabilities can occur . using ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : nusfinger ] ) it can be shown that @xmath54 is always an _ increasing _ function of @xmath47 at low pr and @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that fingering convection is stable to the @xmath53instability , and therefore not likely to transition _ spontaneously _ to a state of layered convection in astrophysics .",
    "the simulations of brown  ( @xcite ) generally confirm this statement , except in a few exceptional cases discussed below .",
    "by contrast , fingering convection does appear to be prone to the collective instability ( as shown in figure [ fig : large - scale ] ) for sufficiently low @xmath47 . by calculating @xmath71 for a typical stellar fluid with pr @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ", we find for instance that gravity waves should emerge when @xmath74 or so . in this regime",
    ", we expect transport to be somewhat larger than for small - scale fingering convection alone , although probably not by more than a factor of 10 ( see figure [ fig : large - scale ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , a first - principles theory for the vertical mixing rate in fingering convection , in the presence of internal gravity waves , remains to be derived .    finally ,",
    "as first hypothesized by stern ( @xcite ) and found in preliminary work by brown  ( @xcite ) , it is possible that these large - scale gravity waves could break on a global scale and mechanically drive the formation of layers .",
    "if this is indeed confirmed , transport could be much larger than estimated in ( [ eq : nusfinger ] ) in the region of parameter space for which @xmath75 .",
    "this , however , remains to be confirmed .",
    "until we gain a better understanding of the various effects of gravity waves described above , ( [ eq : nusfinger ] ) is our best current estimate for transport by fingering convection in astrophysical objects .",
    "an example of the numerical implementation of the model by brown  ( @xcite ) is now available in mesa , and consists of the following steps .",
    "( 1 ) to estimate the local properties of the star , and calculate all governing parameters / diffusivities . ( 2 ) to estimate the properties of the fastest - growing fingering modes using linear theory ( see section [ sec : linear ] ) and ( 3 ) to apply ( [ eq : nusfinger ] ) to calculate @xmath46 , and then ( [ eq : totalfluxes ] ) to calculate @xmath42 .",
    "turbulent heat transport is negligible , so @xmath76 .",
    "3d numerical simulations of oddc were first presented by rosenblum  ( @xcite ) and mirouh  ( @xcite ) . both explored parameter space to measure , as in the case of fingering convection , the functions @xmath48 and @xmath59 after saturation of the basic odd instability .",
    "the values of pr and @xmath7 achieved , however , were not very low , and models are needed once again to extrapolate these results to parameters relevant for stellar interiors .",
    "mirouh  ( @xcite ) proposed an empirical formula for nu@xmath77 ( and nu@xmath49 , via @xmath54 ) , whose parameters were fitted to the experimental data . however , a theory based on first principles is more desirable .",
    "we have recently succeeded in applying a very similar method to the one used by brown  ( @xcite ) to model transport by small - scale oddc . as described in moll  ( @xcite ) ,",
    "a simple approximate estimate for temperature and compositional nusselt numbers can also be derived from the linear theory for the fastest - growing mode ( see section [ sec : linear ] ) , this time in the form of @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 must again be fitted to the existing data ; preliminary results suggest that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    by contrast with fingering convection , oddc is subject to both @xmath53 and collective instabilities .",
    "both modify the vertical heat and compositional fluxes quite significantly so ( [ eq : nusoddc ] ) should _ not _ be used _ as is _ to model mixing by oddc .",
    "it is used , on the other hand , to determine when mean - field instabilities occur .",
    "the region of parameter space unstable to layering can again be determined by calculating @xmath54 ( using [ eq : nusoddc ] this time ) , and checking when @xmath86 .",
    "moll  ( @xcite ) ( see also mirouh , @xcite ) showed that layering is always possible for pr and @xmath7 below one , provided @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "the critical value @xmath88 is fairly close to zero in the parameter regime appropriate for stellar interiors , as @xmath89 in the limit @xmath90 .",
    "this implies that the region of parameter space unstable to layer formation spans nearly the entire oddc range .    as discussed in section [ sec : large ] , the vertical heat and compositional fluxes increase dramatically when a staircase first emerges , and then again at each layer merger .",
    "this was studied by wood  ( @xcite ) , who ran and analyzed simulations for @xmath91 $ ] , and argued that their results are consistent with the following empirical transport laws for layered convection : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are slowly varying functions of @xmath47 and @xmath7 , and where the rayleigh number is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the mean step height in the staircase . for numerically achievable pr and @xmath7",
    ", wood  ( @xcite ) estimated that @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : nuslayers ] ) has two important consequences .",
    "the first is that turbulent heat transport can be significant in layered convection , provided @xmath96 is large enough .",
    "secondly , both nusselt numbers are ( roughly ) proportional to @xmath99 , but nothing so far has enabled us to determine what @xmath96 may be in stellar interiors .",
    "indeed , in _ all _ existing simulations of layered oddc to date , layers were seen to merge fairly rapidly until a single one was left . whether staircases in stellar interiors evolve in the same way , or",
    "eventually reach a stationary state with a layer height smaller than the thickness of the unstable region itself , is difficult to determine without further modeling , and remains the subject of current investigations .",
    "odd systems which do not transition into staircases ( @xmath100 ) also usually evolve further with time after saturation of the basic instability , with the small - scale wave - turbulence gradually giving way to larger - scale gravity waves .",
    "whether the latter are always excited by the collective instability , or could be promoted by other types of nonlinear interactions between modes that transfer energy to larger scales , remains to be determined .",
    "in all cases , these large - scale waves have significant amplitudes and regularly break .",
    "this enhances transport , as it did in the case of fingering convection .",
    "moll  ( @xcite ) found that the resulting nusselt numbers are between 1.2 and 2 across most of the unstable range , regardless of pr or @xmath7 .",
    "these results are still quite preliminary , however , and their dependence on the domain size ( which sets the scale of the longest waves ) remains to be determined .",
    "based on the results obtained so far , and summarized above , a plausible mixing prescription for oddc can be obtained by applying the following steps .",
    "( 1 ) to estimate the local properties of the star , and calculate all governing parameters / diffusivities .",
    "( 2 ) to estimate the properties of the fastest - growing modes using linear theory ( see section [ sec : linear ] ) ( 3 ) to determine whether layers are expected to form or not by calculating @xmath54 ( using [ eq : nusoddc ] ) for neighboring values of @xmath47 , and evaluating @xmath101 . ( 4 )",
    "if the system is layered , then _",
    "assume a layer height _",
    "( for instance , some small fraction of a pressure scaleheight ) , and calculate the heat and compositional fluxes using ( [ eq : totalfluxes ] ) with ( [ eq : nuslayers ] ) . if the system is not expected to form layers , then calculate these fluxes using ( [ eq : totalfluxes ] ) and @xmath102 instead .",
    "the unknown layer height is the only remaining free parameter of this model , and will hopefully be constrained in the future by comparison of the model predictions with asteroseismic results ."
