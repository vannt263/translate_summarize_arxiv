    "<S> its approach to multiple testing differs from that of standard analytic techniques , and provides the ability to resolve associations between variation in hiv rna abundance and variation in hla alleles .    as an application of computational complexity and optimal coding theory to statistical inference , the minimum description length ( mdl ) principle states that the best statistical model , or hypothesis , to account for some observed data is the model that minimizes the sum of the number of bits required to describe both the model and the data encoded via the model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is a model - selection criterion that balances the need for parsimony and fidelity , by penalizing equally for the information required to specify the model and the information required to encode the residual error .    </S>",

    "<S> viral rna set - point levels were determined after acute infection and prior to any therapeutic intervention or the onset of aids , as defined by the presence of an opportunistic infection or cd4@xmath3 t - cell count below 200 per ml of plasma . because the assay has a detection threshold of 300 copies of virus per ml @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , maximum - likelihood estimators were adjusted to avoid biased estimates of population parameters from a truncated , or censored , sample distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> viral rna levels were log - transformed so as better to approximate a normal distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution class i and ii hla genotyping @xcite provided four - digit allele designations , though analyses were generally performed using two - digit allele designations because of the resulting reduction of allelic diversity and increased number of samples per allele . because of the potential for results to be confounded by an effect associated with an individual s ethnicity or revised sampling protocol , two separate analyses were performed , one using data from the entire cohort , and another using only data from caucasian individuals . </S>",

    "<S> the challenge of data classification is to find the best partition , such that observations within a group are well - described as independent draws from a single population , but differences in population distributions exist between groups . </S>",
    "<S> whether the data are better represented as two groups , or more , than as one depends on the description lengths that result .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the family of gaussian distributions to model viral rna levels . </S>",
    "<S> while the mdl strategy can be applied using any probabilistic model , a log - normal distribution is a good choice for the observed plasma viral rna values . </S>",
    "<S> first , the description length of the model and of the data given the model is calculated as described below , grouping all of the observations into one normal distribution , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> next , the data are broken into two partitions , @xmath5 , and the log - rna values associated with hla alleles are partitioned to minimize the description length given the constraint that two gaussian distributions , each having their own mean and variance , are used to model the data .    for fixed @xmath6 covariance matrix @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the description length is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the @xmath10-component vector of observations and @xmath11 is the quantity of information required to specify the partition . </S>",
    "<S> logarithms are computed in base two , with fractional values rounded upwards , so that the resulting units are bits . the description length of interest results from integrating @xmath12 over all covariance matrices with the appropriate structure . in practice , we use laplace s approximation for the integral @xcite which gives , asymptotically , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of free parameters in the covariance model , and @xmath15 is the specific covariance matrix of the appropriate structure that minimizes @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> . a more detailed account appears in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> the analog of a null hypothesis is the assumption that one group of alleles is sufficient to account for the variation in viral rna . </S>",
    "<S> the description length for one group is : @xmath17 , where @xmath10 is the total number of observations , @xmath18 is the maximum - likelihood estimate of the population variance and @xmath19 is the sample mean , computed as the winsorized mean @xcite because of truncation below the sensitivity limit of the rna assay .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the description length for two groups can be computed as :    @xmath20    where @xmath11 is an adjustment for performing multiple comparisons . because additional information is required to specify the optimum partition , the description length is increased by a quantity related to the number of partitions evaluated , such that @xmath21 bits , where @xmath22 is the number of alleles observed at the partitioned locus . for @xmath23 , @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> .    further partitions of alleles into more than two groups might yield a shorter description length , computed as a summation over terms in the equation for @xmath25 for each of the @xmath14 distinct groups .    </S>",
    "<S> the shortest description length for any value of @xmath14 indicates the best choice of model parameters , including the number of parameters , and hence , the optimum partition of @xmath22 alleles into @xmath14 groups . </S>",
    "<S> we denote this as @xmath26 .      </S>",
    "<S> the minimum description length is found by iteratively computing the description length for each possible partition of alleles into groups and taking the minimum as optimal . </S>",
    "<S> iteration consists first of determining the number of alleles , @xmath22 , at a particular locus , and then incrementing through each of the @xmath27 possible partitions of alleles into @xmath14 groups , computing the associated description length , and reporting the best results . </S>",
    "<S> each iteration evaluates one possible mapping of alleles to groups . </S>",
    "<S> searching through all possible partitions using the description length as an optimality criterion ensures selection of the best partition as a result of the search .    </S>",
    "<S> in this mapping , the ordering of groups is informative , because the ordering gives the relative dominance of alleles for diploid loci . </S>",
    "<S> an individual having an allele assigned to the first - order group is assigned to that group . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the individual is assigned to the next appropriate group . </S>",
    "<S> two individuals sharing one allele might be placed in either the same group or different groups , depending on the mapping of alleles to groups in a particular iterate . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider how one might group two individuals , one with alleles _ a1 _ and _ a2 _ at some locus , and another with alleles _ </S>",
    "<S> a2 _ and _ a3_. whether or not they are grouped together depends on the assignment of alleles to groups , and can be done several different ways . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm enumerates each possible assignment of alleles to groups .    the extent of the search scales as @xmath28 . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the most diverse locus was hla - b , with 30 alleles when analyzed using two - digit allele designations . for two groups , </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath29 possible partitions . </S>",
    "<S> serial iteration on an ultrasparc - iii 440mhz cpu ( sun microsystems ) requires roughly 36 hours for completion . </S>",
    "<S> a parallel implementation requires no message passing , so computing time scales inversely with an increasing number of cpus , or doubling available processors halves the time for iteration . with many cpus </S>",
    "<S> , the search space of @xmath30 partitions can be exhaustively evaluated in an hour or less . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , exhaustively evaluating all three - way partitions is prohibitive , as @xmath31 , over a million - fold increase in computational effort ! </S>",
    "<S> supertype classification reduced the diversity of possible partitions and enabled partitioning of the data into more than two groups .    </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm was implemented in c and will be distributed on request .      </S>",
    "<S> the description length for the entire cohort as one group is @xmath32 bits ; for the caucasian subsample , it is @xmath33 bits . </S>",
    "<S> in general , @xmath34 at most loci ( table  1 ) , so the mdl criterion does not support partitioning alleles into groups that are predictive of high or low rna levels , except at hla - b , where @xmath35 . in the subsample , partitioning hla - c or hla - dqb1 alleles can also provide preferred two - way splits , though not as well as hla - b . further partitioning </S>",

    "<S> the theory of optimal coding provides an exact relationship between frequency and code length and thus , probability and description length .    </S>",
    "<S> the key departure of mdl from morse - codelike schemes is that , while morse code would generally be good for sending messages over an average of many texts , specific texts might be encoded even more efficiently , by encoding not only letters , but letter combinations , common words , or even phrases , perhaps as abbreviations or acronyms . </S>",
    "<S> however , if one is to recode for particular texts , one must first transmit the coding scheme . </S>",
    "<S> so perhaps one might use morse code to transmit the details of the new coding scheme and then transmit the text itself with the new scheme . whether this might yield greater efficiency </S>",
    "<S> depends not only on how much compression is achieved in the new encoding , but also on how much overhead is incurred in having to transmit the coding scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> the analogy to scientific data analysis is clear . </S>",
    "<S> a statistical model is an encoding scheme that encapsulates the regularities in the data to yield a concise representation thereof . </S>",
    "<S> the best model effectively compresses regularities in the data , but is not so elaborate that its own description demands a great deal of information to be encoded . </S>",
    "<S> the mdl principle provides a model - selection criterion that balances the need for a model that is both appropriate and parsimonious , by penalizing with equal weights the information required to specify the model and the unexplained , or residual error .    </S>",
    "<S> yet another contribution the mdl principle brings to statistical modelling is that the penalty for multiple comparisons is less restrictive than the penalty of compounded error rates incurred with canonical inferential approaches . in order to maintain a desired experiment - wide error rate , </S>",
    "<S> the standard adjustment is to make the per - comparison error rate considerably more stringent . with current technology , realistic sample sizes for such studies </S>",
    "<S> will generally be less than a thousand and stringent significance levels will be difficult to surpass . </S>",

    "<S> supertype alleles , individuals with _ </S>",
    "<S> b58s _ have lower viral rna levels than those who lack them , even among homozygotic individuals . naturally , this leads one to consider mechanisms that underlie patterns found in the data . </S>",
    "<S> elsewhere , we consider two hypotheses to explain the observed associations between hla alleles and variation in viral rna @xcite .    there may be allele - specific variation in antigen - binding specificity . </S>",
    "<S> some alleles may have greater affinity than others for hiv - specific peptide fragments due to the peptide - binding anchor motifs they present . </S>",
    "<S> we were not able to identify any clear association between the frequency of anchor motifs among hiv-1 proteins and viral rna levels in the chicago macs @xcite , though others have suggested that such a relationship might exist @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it may also the case that frequency - dependent selection has favored rare alleles . </S>",
    "<S> frequent alleles provide the evolving pathogen greater opportunity to explore mutant phenotypes that may escape detection by the host s immune response . by encountering rare alleles </S>",
    "<S> less frequently , the virus has not had the same opportunity to explore mutations that evade the host s defense response . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis is corroborated by a significant association between viral rna and hla allele frequency in the chicago macs sample @xcite .    because their predictions differ , these hypotheses could be tested with data from another cohort , where a different viral subtype predominates . </S>",
    "<S> that is , if other alleles were associated with low viral rna than those identified in this study , and an association between rare alleles and low viral rna levels were observed there , then the second hypothesis would be more viable than the first . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , if a clear association between antigen peptide - binding anchor motifs and variation in viral rna levels were found , the first hypothesis would be more viable . </S>",
    "<S> other mechanisms are also possible , and hypotheses by which to evaluate them merit consideration .      </S>",

    "<S> the population means are treated as random variables and integrated out of the likelihood . </S>",
    "<S> the model is then specified entirely by the structure of the covariance matrix @xmath7 , which specifies how each pair of observations is correlated . </S>",
    "<S> the covariance is greater for two observations from the same partition than for two observations from different partitions . </S>",

    "<S> let the number of components of @xmath50 ( the number of free parameters in the covariance matrix ) be @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> then the mdl for the given covariance structure is : @xmath52 , where @xmath11 is the information required to specify the partition or , equivalently , the covariance structure , and @xmath53 is the vector of covariance parameters evaluated at maximum likelihood .    * one gaussian population . * </S>",
    "<S> the covariance matrix has a component @xmath54 for the covariance among observations , induced by their sharing an unspecified mean , and an error component @xmath55 : @xmath56 , with @xmath57 the column vector of all ones , @xmath58 the matrix of all ones , and @xmath59 the identity matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse is :    @xmath60    and the log - determinant : @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath62 .    </S>",

    "<S> there are two cases . </S>",

    "<S> here we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 , so @xmath66 . </S>",

    "<S> two partitions give two populations . </S>",
    "<S> to analyze the hla / hiv data , we treated these populations as independent . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we take the covariance between observations in separate partitions to be zero , and apply the fitting procedure outlined above separately to the two populations . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative is to take non - zero covariance between the two populations . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a more elaborate estimation procedure , unlikely to yield large efficiency gains because the two degrees of freedom ( population means ) are essentially mixed into one , with residual error .    </S>",
    "<S> the procedure examines each admissible partition and computes the mdl for that partition as the sum of individual description lengths over the two independent populations . </S>",
    "<S> the best partition yields the lowest description length over all partitions . </S>",
    "<S> this , plus the cost of specifying the partition , is compared with the mdl from the unpartitioned data . if the best partition provides a better representation of the data than the unpartitioned set ( @xmath71 ) , then the process is repeated in a recursive manner , independently within each of the partitioned populations .    99    mcmichael ,  a.  j. & rowland - jones ,  s.  l.
