    "photons from the last scattering surface of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) detected at redshift zero , are inevitably lensed by cosmological structures .",
    "this lensing produces a number of modifications to the cmb angular power spectrum , deviations from gaussianity , and @xmath5-polarization .",
    "while these effects have been extensively studied , and a review of their impact can be found in @xcite , we are here concerned with the lensing due to strongly nonlinear objects such as galaxy clusters and smaller - scale structures . in particular , we focus our attention on the estimation of the small angular scale ( high @xmath4 ) correlations induced by this lensing .",
    "this marks a somewhat different direction to the extensive recent efforts to extend n - body simulation techniques to all - sky modelling ( @xcite ) .",
    "n - body simulations are necessary to estimate some cmb anisotropies .",
    "this is the case for the gravitational anisotropies ( weak lensing and rees - sciama effects ) produced by strongly nonlinear cosmological structures .",
    "while simulations with sufficient resolution to model the formation of galaxies within an entire hubble volume are currently out of reach , researchers are getting close to this goal @xcite .",
    "however , until such simulations are possible in order to estimate gravitational anisotropies in the cmb it is necessary to create an artificial periodic universe where copies of the simulation box at various redshifts are replicated back to a given redshift . while numerous alternatives exist for how this is achieved all the methods propagate cmb photons along appropriate directions within these model universes .",
    "when conducting this ray - tracing , box sizes , spatial scales and ray directions must be chosen in such a way that the periodicity of the artificial universe has no appreciable effects on the resulting anisotropy .",
    "the ray - tracing procedure used here achieves these goals and was described and applied in earlier papers , where it was also compared with previous methods @xcite .",
    "two of these earlier papers dealt with weak lensing @xcite , and two others with the rees - sciama effect @xcite .",
    "the simulations discussed in these papers were conducted with the particle - mesh ( pm , @xcite ) n - body simulation algorithm . for the large simulation boxes required in our study ( see below )",
    "the spatial resolution of pm simulations is moderate , at best .",
    "for this reason it was suggested in these papers that better n - body simulations might be necessary to estimate good cmb angular power spectra for large multipole indexes ( @xmath0 values ) .",
    "this suggestion is confirmed in the present study , where ap3",
    "m ( adaptive particle - particle , particle - mesh ; @xcite ) simulations with high resolution are performed to build up an appropriate periodic universe , in which the cmb photons are then moved according to the aforementioned ray - tracing procedure .",
    "a cmb angular power spectrum has been estimated from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and the accuracy of this spectrum in various @xmath4-intervals is discussed .    motivated by a desire to match a number of cosmological constraints , including the five - year wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) observations , high - redshift supernovae measurements and galaxy surveys , ( spergel 2007 ; vianna & liddle 1996 ; riess 1998 ; perlmutter 1999 ) we consider a cosmological model in which the universe is flat and the initial fluctuation spectrum has an inflationary origin .",
    "it is assumed that only scalar perturbations are present and that weak lensing from gravitational waves is negligible .",
    "the resulting distribution of perturbations is then gaussian and the perturbations themselves are purely adiabatic .",
    "post inflation , the power spectrum of the perturbations is almost exactly of the harrison - zeldovich @xcite form .",
    "this power spectrum is then modified during the radiation - dominated phase , as acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon fluid damp growth , an effect accounted for by our use of a cmbfast calculation of the transfer function .",
    "the following cosmological parameters are used for consistency with the standard model @xcite : ( 1 ) a reduced hubble constant @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the hubble constant in units of km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ) ; ( 2 ) density parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for the baryonic , dark matter , and vacuum energy , respectively ( the matter density parameter is then @xmath14 ) ; ( 3 ) an optical depth @xmath15 which characterizes the reionization ; and ( 4 ) a parameter @xmath16 normalizing the power spectrum of the energy perturbations .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section [ maps ] we outline salient issues in our map - making technique .",
    "we follow this in section [ nbody ] with an outline of n - body methods and our ray - tracing technique .",
    "results from our new simulations are presented in section [ results ] along with a critical comparison to earlier work .",
    "we then compare our results to current observations and conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "we begin by describing the procedure for constructing lensed maps of the cmb from small unlensed maps at the last scattering surface .",
    "note that in this section and those following , we choose units such that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the speed of light and @xmath19 the gravitational constant . for a quantity @xmath20 , @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 denote the value of @xmath20 at , respectively , the time of emission ( last scattering surface ) and the present .",
    "the scale factor is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the cosmological time , and its present value , @xmath25 , is assumed to be unity , which is always possible in flat universes .",
    "the unit vector @xmath26 defines the observation direction ( line of sight ) .",
    "small , unlensed maps of cmb temperature contrasts ( @xmath27 ) must be constructed to be subsequently deformed by lensing .",
    "these maps have been obtained with a method based on the fast fourier transform @xcite and lead to small squared - gaussian maps of the contrast @xmath28 .",
    "these maps are uniformly pixelised .",
    "the code designed to build up the unlensed maps ( map making procedure ) , requires the cmb angular power spectrum , which has been obtained by running the cmbfast code @xcite for the model described above . in order to deform the unlensed maps ,",
    "the lens deviations corresponding to a set of directions , covering an appropriate region of the sky , must be calculated .",
    "these deviations are the quantities @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the transverse gradient of the peculiar gravitational potential @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the variable @xmath33 is @xmath34    in the case of weak lensing , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ devi ] ) is usually integrated along straight paths , ignoring the small deflections associated with the lensing effect .",
    "this approximation , commonly known as the born approximation , is equivalent to keeping first order terms in a positional expansion of the transverse potential as a function of the normal ray and its lensing offset .",
    "while this approximation is known to be comparatively inaccurate at small @xmath4 ( @xcite ) , at @xmath35 detailed calculations using higher order perturbation theory suggest that corrections to the first order assumption are approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the first order term @xcite .",
    "recent n - body simulation work examining the validity of the born approximation ( @xcite ) has shown corrections only begin to become significant at the 5% level for @xmath36 .",
    "since we are interested in calculating @xmath37 values we cautiously accept the errors inherent in the first order approach .",
    "once the deviations have been calculated , they can be easily used to get the lensed maps from the unlensed ones .",
    "this is achieved using the relation @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the temperature contrasts of the lensed and unlensed maps , respectively .",
    "given the unlensed map @xmath41 , and the map @xmath39 obtained from it after deformation by lensing ( the lensed map ) , the chosen power spectrum estimator can be used to get the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 , whose differences @xmath44 can be considered as an appropriate measure of the weak lensing effect on the cmb . moreover , a map of deformations @xmath45 can be obtained and these can be analyzed to get another angular power spectrum @xmath46 . since the maps @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not statistically independent , the spectra @xmath46 and @xmath49 appear to be very different ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "eight hundred unlensed maps are lensed ( deformed ) by using the same @xmath50 field and the average @xmath46 and @xmath49 spectra are calculated and analyzed .",
    "both spectra are very distinct measures of the weak lensing effect under consideration .",
    "many times , only the customary oscillating @xmath49 spectrum is shown ; however , in a few appropriate cases , the @xmath46 spectra are displayed .",
    "our power spectrum estimator was described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "results obtained with this estimator were compared with those of the code anafast of the healpix @xcite package in @xcite and also in @xcite .",
    "these comparisons showed that our estimator is a very good one in the case of regularly pixelised squared maps as analyzed here .",
    "the primary simulations presented in this work were run using a parallel openmp - based implementation of the `` hydra '' code @xcite .",
    "this code uses the ap3 m algorithm to calculate gravitational forces within a simulation containing @xmath51 particles . in the ap3 m algorithm a cubic  base",
    "\" mesh of size @xmath52 cells per side is supplemented by a series of refined - mesh p3 m calculations to provide sub - mesh resolution .",
    "gravitational softening is implemented using the s2 softening kernel @xcite which is remarkably similar in shape to the cubic spline softening kernel used in many treecodes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the s2 softening used in the kernel is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an equivalent plummer softening length which we quote throughout the paper to enable a simple comparison to other work .",
    "the softening length is held constant in physical coordinates subject to the resolution not falling below 0.6 of the interparticle spacing at high redshift .",
    "this technique is widely applied ( @xcite ) and is a compromise between assuring that the potential energy of clusters does not evolve significantly at low redshift , while still ensuring structures and linear perturbations at high redshift are followed with reasonable accuracy .    lccccccccccccc rls_aa & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 25 & 0.59 & d512a + rls_ab & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 25 & 0.59 & d512b + rls_ba & ap3 m & @xmath55 & b & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 25 & 0.59 & d512a + rls_ca & ap3 m & @xmath55 & c & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 25 & 0.59 & d512a + ls_lda & ap3 m & @xmath58 & d & @xmath56 & 88 & 1024 & 24 & @xmath57 & 1024 & 6 & 50 & 0.59 & d1024a + ls_mab & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath59 & 88 & 512 & 24 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 50 & 0.59 & d512b + ls_@xmath60s1aa & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 24 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 50 & 0.59 & d512a + ls_@xmath60s2aa & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 36 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 75 & 0.59 & d512a + ls_@xmath601aa & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 12 & 0.59 & d512a + ls_@xmath601ab & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 12 & 0.59 & d512b + ls_@xmath601ba & ap3 m & @xmath55 & b & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 12 & 0.59 & d512a + ls_@xmath601bb & ap3 m & @xmath55 & b & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 12 & 0.59 & d512b + ls_@xmath602aa & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 40 & 0.59 & d512a + ls_@xmath602ab & ap3 m & @xmath55 & a & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 40 & 0.59 & d512b + ls_@xmath602ba & ap3 m & @xmath55 & b & @xmath56 & 11 & 1024 & 12 & @xmath57 & 512 & 6 & 40 & 0.59 & d512a + ls_@xmath602bb & ap3",

    "we begin ray tracing within the simulation at @xmath67 and consider nonlinear spatial scales having wavenumbers @xmath78 .",
    "other methods utilizing simulations have also included the contribution to lensing from all scales above a certain redshift using special techniques @xcite .    in figure  [ fig0 ]",
    "we show calculations of the lu angular power spectra for the awl , bwl and cwl lensing regimes for @xmath83 using the nonlinear lensing implementation in cmbfast .",
    "note that for @xmath84 the awl and cwl effects are too small to be calculated with cmbfast due to the fact that these spectra are obtained as differences between other spectra provided by the code .",
    "both the awl and cwl effects , as calculated by cmbfast , are clearly small with the cwl effect being virtually negligible in the @xmath83 range . as anticipated , the bwl effect is dominant .",
    "the calculation of the awl effect provides an initial estimate of the signal we wish to calculate with the simulation .",
    "we have verified that , for @xmath85 , the bwl effects calculated by using both the linear and nonlinear methods implemented in cmbfast are almost identical , which proves that the bwl component is linear , as expected .",
    "an estimate of the lens deviation integral , given in eq .",
    "( [ devi ] ) , is computed via a numerical integration performed along the background null geodesics from the comoving distance @xmath86 corresponding to @xmath67 ( in the model under consideration ) to the observer position .",
    "the gradient of the peculiar potential @xmath87 used in the integrand of eq .",

    "decide upon the direction of the normal rays representing the geodesics ( see section  [ pref ] ) 2 .",
    "assuming the born approximation and using the photon step distance @xmath89 ( see section  [ pref ] ) determine all the evaluation positions and times on the geodesics within the simulation volume from @xmath67 down to the final redshift 3 .",
    "associate test particles with each of these positions and times 4 .   at each time",
    "- step of the n - body simulation ( while it is running ) determine which test particles require force evaluations 5 .   at each test particle position",
    "evaluate the force on the test particle using the long - range fft component and short - range pp correction as in the hydra algorithm 6 .   during the fft convolution for the test particles eliminate contributions from scales larger than @xmath90 mpc by removing the signal from wavenumbers satisfying @xmath81 mpc@xmath10 7 .",
    "if the evaluation time for a point on the geodesic lies between two time - steps calculate a linear interpolation of the two forces from the time - steps that straddle the correct time 8 .",
    "resolve the force into its transverse component and hence recover the transverse component of the potential gradient    once all the potential gradients are evaluated we can calculate the lensing deviation integrals .",
    "we emphasize that our algorithm ensures the potential gradient along normal rays is calculated very accurately and corresponds exactly ( modulo the removal of power from scales greater than @xmath90 mpc ) to that in the simulation .",
    "we do not resort to smoothing onto grids or the creation of lensing planes `` on the fly '' .",
    "the main drawback of our method is that since lensing is now an integral part of the n - body simulation , a different preferred direction requires a new n - body simulation .      to calculate the photon propagation",
    ", the cmb photons are moved through the simulation volume along specially chosen paths to avoid repeatedly sampling the same structures .",
    "this approach uses all steps from the simulation and by using the periodicity of the box volume there are no discontinuities in the matter field anywhere . in principle",
    "this approach is similar to tiling methods that are used elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "these methods are based on independent pm simulations with decreasing sizes that telescope in resolution along the line of sight . in our `` tiling '' the matter field",
    "is constantly being updated by the ap3 m code as the time - step changes and , consequently , it is not limited by the box size .",
    "we also take care to ensure paths are taken which avoid , as much as possible , periodicity effects .",
    "this is notably different from other approaches using random translations and orientations ( @xcite ) of the simulation volume which , unavoidably , have discontinuities at adjoining radial shells .",
    "while the signal from such discontinuities is likely small , our method has the advantage of avoiding it completely .    choosing the directions for the ray propagation is not entirely trivial . for the directions parallel to the box edges , periodicity effects are clearly very strong .",
    "photons moving along these directions would pass close to the same structures in successive boxes and , consequently , the lensing effect of the same structure would be included a number of times ( one per crossed box ) .",
    "this repetition would lead to a false magnification of lens deviations .",
    "however , as has been emphasized in @xcite and @xcite , periodicity effects are negligible along certain directions , hereafter called _",
    "preferred directions_.    in order to define preferred directions , it can be assumed that : ( i ) the @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 axes are parallel to the box edges ; ( ii ) the angles @xmath94 and @xmath95 are spherical coordinates defined with respect to these axes ; ( iii ) photons moving along the direction @xmath26 , cross the @xmath96 face of a box at point @xmath97 , and the next @xmath96 face at point @xmath98 ; and ( iv ) if the segment pq is projected onto the @xmath96 plane , the length of the resulting projection is @xmath99 .",
    "then , if the condition @xmath100 is satisfied , the direction @xmath101 is assumed to be a preferred one . taking into account this definition of preferred directions and the cutoff performed at the scale @xmath102 , it is clear that photons moving along preferred directions enter successive boxes through independent uncorrelated regions .",
    "moreover , for these directions and the box sizes of interest , it can be easily verified that the cmb photons can travel from @xmath67 to @xmath77 ( @xmath103 ) through different uncorrelated regions ( without repetitions ) located in successive simulation boxes .",
    "periodicity effects can , therefore , be assumed to be negligible .",
    "the total number of crossed boxes is denoted by @xmath104 .",
    "some preferred directions used in this paper are defined in table [ tab1 ] , where the first column gives the names of all these directions .",
    "each of them has been used in universes covered by simulation boxes with a given size , as detailed in the second column .",

    "the distance @xmath99 defined in the previous paragraph is given in the fifth column and , finally , in the last column the number of boxes crossed by the cmb photons from redshift @xmath107 to the present is given . from the values of table  [ tab1 ] , it is clear that the distance @xmath99 is much greater than @xmath108 in all four cases , which ensures that other directions close enough to the listed ones are also preferred directions .",

    "then , these squared maps are uniformly pixelised by choosing a certain number of pixels , @xmath109 , per edge .",
    "the angular resolution is then @xmath110 .",
    "the directions of all the pixels are preferred ones and , consequently , lens deviations can be calculated for each pixel  with no significant periodic effects  across the full map .",
    "the parameters involved in the ray - tracing procedure are thus summarized : a number of directions , @xmath111 , per edge of the squared cmb map ( one per pixel , @xmath112 ) ; an initial redshift , @xmath113 , for the calculation of lens deviations ; a step , @xmath114 , to perform the integral in eq.([devi ] ) ( hereafter called the photon step ) ; and the angles @xmath105 and @xmath106 defining the preferred direction .",
    "hereafter , a lensing simulation ( ls ) is the calculation of the @xmath50-deviations along the pixel directions , plus the construction of the @xmath40 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 maps and the estimation of @xmath46 and @xmath49 ( angular power spectra ) .",

    "the lensing simulations ( lss ) obtained from the parameters : @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ( as in all the simulations used in the paper ) , and @xmath123 , are hereafter called reference lensing simulations ( rlss ) .",
    "the angular resolution of these simulations is @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "there are an infinite number of possible realizations of this type of lss corresponding to different initial conditions for the n - body simulation as well as to distinct preferred directions .",
    "we also consider the effect on the lss of changing parameters to ensure that the calculation of the power spectra @xmath46 and @xmath49 is as robust and accurate as possible .",
    "to determine the impact of changing the final ray - tracing epoch , the rls_aa lensing simulation ( based on the preferred direction @xmath126 , see tables [ tab1 ] & [ tab2 ] ) , was used to estimate lensing from @xmath122 to final redshifts between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the @xmath129 angular power spectra corresponding to the final redshifts 0.3 ( dotted line ) , 0.2 ( solid line ) , and 0.0 ( dashed line ) are presented . clearly , these three spectra are very similar .",
    "we find the same result for the @xmath130 spectra ( these results are omitted since the addition of five oscillating lines would lead to a confusing plot and add little information ) .",
    "based upon these results we conclude that the signal produced between redshifts @xmath131 and @xmath128 contributes negligibly to the total lensing .",
    "given this fact , and that the cpu time required to evolve between @xmath132 and @xmath77 is comparatively lengthy for our code ( due to the absence of individual particle time - steps ) , our calculations are performed between redshifts @xmath122 and @xmath133 .",
    "the same study has been done for other rlss corresponding to different initial conditions and preferred directions .",
    "the conclusions are the same in all the cases , namely a negligible effect between @xmath132 and @xmath77 .",
    "we note that this conclusion is in close agreement with that of @xcite who showed that stopping at @xmath134 produced a deficit in the low @xmath4 signal but a negligible difference for @xmath135 .",
    "we next compare lss constructed from pm and ap3 m n - body codes to examine the impact of sub - mesh - scale resolution on the lensing signal . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the @xmath49 ( top panel ) and @xmath46 ( bottom panel ) for rls_ba ( solid line ) along with the same spectra for pmls ( dashed line ) , obtained from a pm code . details of the pm code can be found in @xcite ; this code has been used in previous papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that the same ray - tracing procedure , described in section  [ nbody ] , is used in both codes .",
    "the parameters of the pmls ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) are as follows : @xmath136 , @xmath118 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , and the preferred direction is d256a ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the effective resolution @xmath140 of the pm code is two cells ( 1 @xmath141 in this case ) ; hence , in the pmls , the photon step @xmath89 must be smaller than @xmath142 to take advantage of the pmls resolution .",

    "is estimated to be @xmath144 , which means that , in our rlss , the photon step is a little smaller than a half of the effective resolution .",
    "examination of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the pmls traces the peaks , but the amplitudes are too small and , moreover , the @xmath49 quantities quickly tend to zero as @xmath0 increases .",
    "however , in the ap3 m case , the peaks have greater amplitudes and , furthermore , a signal of a few micro - kelvin appears for high @xmath0 values .",
    "similar conclusions follow from the @xmath129 spectra of the bottom panel , which can be directly compared with @xcite , where this kind of spectrum was used .",
    "these results show that the pmls underestimates the lensing signal we are calculating .",
    "hence , high resolution n - body simulations , be they ap3 m or computed using some alternative algorithm , are necessary to estimate cmb weak lensing from strongly nonlinear structures .",
    "having shown that the results from the ap3 m simulations are distinctly different from those of the pm simulations , we must still account for variability of results due to changing the random modes in the initial conditions of the simulation . to this end",
    "we show , in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the @xmath130 angular power spectra corresponding to three distinct rlss , namely , rls_aa , rls_ba & rls_ca ,",
    "each drawn from a different realization of the modes but using the same preferred direction ( @xmath126 in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the results are clearly qualitatively very similar and the only noticeable quantitative differences are below @xmath145 .",
    "this is not entirely surprising since the lower the @xmath4 value the larger the sample variance @xcite .",
    "additionally , the largest deviation occurs at the point where the signal is weakest , again an unsurprising result .",
    "these results suggest that a good average @xmath130 spectrum can be achieved from just a few chosen rlss simulations , perhaps as few as two .",
    "we have verified this assertion in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , by plotting the average of two of the rlss as compared to the average of all three rlss .",
    "both average spectra are so similar that only two rlss suffice to get a very good average @xmath130 spectrum in the @xmath4-interval under consideration . unsurprisingly , the average signals for @xmath146 are in good agreement , as would be expected if the differences in the single realizations were due to sample variance . for @xmath147 ,",
    "the spectra of the different realizations are so similar that a unique rls leads to a rather good @xmath130 spectrum of the lensing effect under consideration ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the sample variance we have been talking about is inherent in the lensing calculation itself , rather than the cmb maps themselves .",
    "for each rls , the spectra are calculated from @xmath150 small maps having a size of @xmath151 degrees ; which is a necessary step to understand small sample variances ( small deviations from spectrum to spectrum ) .",
    "in terms of the variance produced by different preferred directions , the ergodic nature of the ray - tracing means that we might reasonably expect the same level of variance seen for the different n - body realizations with differing modes . nevertheless , choosing a different preferred direction for a given rls means that the photons move through different regions of the simulation box and cross box faces in different places and a different number of times .",
    "so the trajectories are not fully equivalent , in turn producing lensing deviations that are subtly distinct . to evaluate this difference we plot , in fig .  [ fig4 ] , two @xmath130 angular power spectra for the rlss rls_aa and rls_ab which use the same initial modes , but have preferred directions d512a and d512b .",
    "the similarity of the two curves indicates that , as anticipated , results are almost independent of the chosen preferred direction , and that our ray - tracing procedure is robust .",
    "thus far we have considered ap3 m simulations with box sizes @xmath152 mpc , and hence the @xmath130 and @xmath129 spectra have been obtained from small maps of angular size @xmath153 .",
    "we next examine whether these values are too small to make robust predictions .    in order to answer this question",
    ", we conducted an ls , labeled ls_lda in table  [ tab2 ] , with @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which leads to a lensed map of size @xmath156 and with the same angular resolution as in the rlss . since simulating a larger volume at fixed particle resolution requires a larger softening and the corresponding photon step , the values @xmath157 , and @xmath158 were used .",
    "the preferred direction was d1024a ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . to compare to this simulation we also ran another ls , denoted ls_mab , with parameters set to mimic the ls_lda simulation but in 1/8th the volume and using 1/8th the number of particles .",
    "the @xmath130 spectra obtained for the two simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and are extremely similar .",
    "this is despite the fact that these two simulations have differing initial conditions , different box sizes , and different numbers of crossed boxes , @xmath104 .",
    "hence we conclude that a box size of @xmath159the same as that of the rlss  is large enough to get very good angular power spectra for the range of @xmath4 considered .",
    "even smaller sizes , , @xmath160 , can be used when only large enough @xmath4 values are under consideration ( see below ) .",
    "although we do not directly calculate the 2d lensing potential or convergence we can examine the power spectrum of the angle @xmath161 as in @xcite . at our final redshift of 0.2 ,",
    "the angular resolution of our rlss ( 0.59 ) corresponds to a comoving separation of 100@xmath162 kpc , which is still larger than our nominal n - body resolution of 5@xmath163 kpc .",

    "for comparison to semi - analytic methods we also include the _ total _ lensing signal predicted by camb in this @xmath4 range . comparing to a running average constructed by binning the average signal in @xmath165 ,",
    "the rms deviations relative to the overall signal are 4.1% , 5.3% and 6.2% for the three box sizes , respectively .",
    "although we do see an increase in the relative noise with reducing box size , the overall noise is much less than the underlying signal .",
    "further , the absolute value of the signals are in close agreement as well , the largest difference being @xmath166 at @xmath167 and the qualitative shape of the power spectra agree well at least for @xmath168 .",
    "for @xmath169 we see a difference of 50% in the signals , and we are not confident of convergence in the interval @xmath170 ( see sections  [ conv2 ] , [ conv ] for an extensive discussion of convergence issues )",

    "a ratio @xmath172 , identical to that of the rls simulations has been assumed in all the cases , thus maintaining a constant ratio between the photon step and the effective resolution ( @xmath173 photon steps per effective resolution interval ) . we considered the following new pairs of @xmath171 and @xmath114 : ( i ) @xmath157 and @xmath174 and , ( ii ) @xmath175 and @xmath176 , and call the lss associated with these parameters ls_@xmath60s1aa and ls_@xmath60s2aa respectively .",

    ", we can not decide which of the three lines of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is closer to the true spectrum .",
    "regardless of this issue , any of these lines gives a good estimate of the required spectrum for @xmath180 .    to address the role of the photon step alone , we next held fixed all the rls parameters except the photon step , @xmath89 . along with our original choice of @xmath181 ,",
    "two new values were considered : @xmath182 ( @xmath183 , corresponding to lss ls_@xmath601aa , ls_@xmath601ab , ls_@xmath601ba , ls_@xmath601bb ) , and @xmath184 ( a little smaller than @xmath185 , corresponding to lss ls_@xmath602aa , ls_@xmath602ab , ls_@xmath602ba , ls_@xmath602bb ) . for each of the @xmath89 two distinct preferred directions , namely @xmath126 and @xmath186 ,",

    "the four spectra for each @xmath89 value were then averaged and the resulting spectra plotted in fig .",
    "note , that since the error in the lensing deviation integrals is reduced with decreasing @xmath89 , we can reasonably argue that our best estimate of the lensing signal is given by the minimum @xmath89 .",
    "we see that in all three cases the @xmath49 quantities are in close agreement up to @xmath177 . in the @xmath4-interval [ 7,00010,000 ] ,",
    "the separations between the three curves increase , with a systematic trend of a lower signal with decreasing photon - step .",
    "since all these spectra have the same simulation softening it is reasonable to conclude that the trend we observed when comparing different @xmath187 and @xmath89 may actually be a function of the change in @xmath89 . given that the smallest @xmath89 exhibits the lowest signal , we thus conclude that our best estimate of the signal actually has the smallest correlations for @xmath188 values . nonetheless , for @xmath189 , the rls closely follows our best estimate , hence for @xmath189 we are very confident that the rls leads to a robust estimate of the lensing effect we are studying . even if the @xmath190 value leads to the most accurate spectrum ( which is not certain ) , the computational cost of constructing these lss is significantly greater than that of the rlss , while only providing a mild improvement in accuracy for @xmath178 .    we have also attempted to reproduce results similar to that found elsewhere using interpolation methods .",
    "we ran another simulation using rls_aa parameters , except that this time the deflections were calculated using the 8 nearest neighbours .",
    "this keeps the mass resolution of the simulation fixed and does not alter the gravitational calculation , while at the same time lowering the effective resolution of the lensing methodology . the resulting power spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "this shows that as we degrade the resolution of ray - tracing method we do indeed recover previous results .      since our ray - tracing method samples the local gravitational field on scales down to a few tens of kpc , it is important to investigate the role of mass resolution on our simulation .",
    "while we have investigated box size earlier , which at a fixed resolution leads to a change in mass resolution , in this section we focus on changing the mass resolution in a fixed volume , and also include one additional simulation in a smaller volume at our maximum mass resolution .",
    "we ran additional simulations with @xmath62 and @xmath59 particles in the rls box size , namely @xmath191 mpc .",
    "these simulations are labeled ls_lha and ls_mga in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "notable other parameters were @xmath192 kpc , @xmath193 kpc and particle masses were @xmath194 respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig8new ] we plot the power spectrum results for these simulations , along with an rls , another @xmath56 simulation with a shorter photon step ( ls_1ab ) , and one final simulation labeled ls_hea that uses a volume 1/8th the size of an rls but with the same number of particles .",
    "the parameters of this ls were @xmath195 mpc , @xmath196 kpc and @xmath197 kpc .",
    "note the two @xmath56 simulations have the same mass resolution but they bracket a range of photon - step values , a full estimate of the uncertainty in the signal at this mass resolution is given in figure 13 , where the spectra of these two cases appear inside the band of uncertainty . due to the different box size of the ls_hea run",
    "we could not maintain the same modes across all runs , and hence we used different initial modes at different resolutions .",
    "taken together , these simulations span a ratio in mass resolution of 512 .",
    "the plot shows that when pp corrections are included there is a resolution - dependent up - turn in the power spectrum for @xmath198 .",
    "improving the mass resolution reduces the impact of n - body discreteness on the lensing ( @xcite ) to the point where the highest resolution simulation ( ls_hea ) appears to be free of this contamination for @xmath199 . turning to lower @xmath4 values",

    "the effective resolution @xmath203 of the ls_hea simulation is half of that attained in the rlss and thus small scales should be represented more accurately . as a result of the reduced box size , the angular size of the lensed maps is @xmath204 and the angular resolution limit @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) is half that of the rlss ( higher resolution ) .    the resulting spectrum is plotted in fig .

    "finally , for @xmath214 , the smaller box produces a decrease , whereas the previous ls increases slightly .",
    "this unfortunately suggests that the n - body simulations and the cmb lensed maps used to derive the rlss are not good enough for @xmath178 .",

    "despite the large differences in the numerical parameters defining the n - body simulations , we see that from @xmath223 to @xmath224 , all the spectra lie in a narrow band ( bounded by the solid lines of fig .",

    "in addition to the simulation lines ( solid and dotted ) we have plotted estimates of the lensing signal based upon semi - analytical approaches implemented in the cmbfast code @xcite . by using the nonlinear version of this code with a minimum scale of @xmath225 ( as in our ls , leading to the lower solid line of fig .

    "the complementary @xmath222 effect ( see the bottom left panel of fig .  [ fig0 ] ) is too small to be significant in the @xmath217-interval ( 3.5 , 4.0 ) .",
    "the @xmath220 effect obtained with cmbfast ( nonlinear version ) is shown in the dot - dashed line of fig .",

    "to compare this result with other simulation work , we turn to the work by @xcite . since our map - making method does not allow us to plot the lensed and unlensed @xmath234 we have converted their results ( specifically those in their figure 4 ) to the @xmath235^{1/2}$ ] values we use in our paper . in performing this conversion",
    "we have multiplied their power spectra by a factor of @xmath236 @xmath237k@xmath238 which includes the effective fractional sky coverage , @xmath239 .",

    "our cosmology and assumptions about reionization and backgrounds are slightly different from those in @xcite , however it is clear that we find a higher signal at @xmath245 when short range corrections are included .    as it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the @xmath220 effect clearly dominates the primary anisotropies for @xmath246 ( the continuous and dotted lines are well above the dash - three - dots one ) . however , the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect is also important at these scales , and foregrounds must be properly accounted for .",
    "the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) , has reported @xcite a temperature power ( @xmath2^{1/2}$ ] ) of @xmath247 at 68 % confidence , for @xmath248 . in order to explain @xmath249 as an sz effect , one must have @xmath250 @xcite , but this is in comparatively strong disagreement with data from wmap ( see section  [ sec1 ] ) that lead to @xmath251 .",
    "hence , taking into account that the sz temperature power scales as @xmath252 @xcite , the sz effect could only explain around the 44.5 % of the most likely bima value ( @xmath253 ) .",
    "the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) observations , @xcite , cover the multipole range @xmath254 and , in a recent analysis @xcite , it is argued that , if the cbi excess power observed at very small angular scales is explained as a sz effect for a certain @xmath255 value , then a power close to @xmath256 , marginally compatible with bima measurements at @xmath248 , may be explained with the same value of @xmath255 .    the level of power we predict for the weak lensing ( @xmath220 plus @xmath221 components ) may thus be a missing link , simultaneously ensuring the compatibility of wmap , cbi and bima observations .",
    "we have predicted a lensing effect of a few micro - kelvin for these large angular scales , and hence a smaller sz component ( a smaller value of @xmath255 ) could lead to simultaneous compatibility with wmap , cbi , and bima observations . aside from the large errors bars on the bima measurement , we are also cautious about making firm claims since lensing and sz effects are essentially produced by the same structure distributions ( galaxy clusters and sub - structures involving dark matter and baryons ) and , consequently , these effects must be strongly correlated .",
    "this implies that the spectra of these two effects must be superposed in an unknown way ( not merely added ) . in practice",
    ", this superposition might be analyzed in detail with ray - tracing through hydrodynamical simulations ( including both baryons and dark matter ) .",
    "more work along these lines is clearly necessary .",
    "our first conclusion , in agreement with other work , is that pm simulations are inefficient for calculating cmb lensing due to strongly nonlinear structures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and comments in section  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "while it is not impossible to simulate these effects with a pm code the required resolution is so large that the additional short - scale resolution provided by ap3 m ( or other high resolution n - body technique ) is far more efficient at capturing the lensing effect .",
    "hence our development of a combined parallel ap3m - ray - tracing code is a necessary step to estimate the lensing signal at high @xmath4 .    only the @xmath220 effect ( see section  [ nbody ] ) produced by scales smaller than @xmath257 between redshifts @xmath258 and",
    "@xmath259 has been estimated with ap3 m simulations .",
    "this choice is appropriate for the following reasons : ( 1 ) all the strongly nonlinear scales are taken into account ; ( 2 ) omitting scales greater than @xmath257 makes our ray - tracing procedure efficient ( see section  [ nbody ] ) ; ( 3 ) the effect produced by scales greater than @xmath260 ( @xmath221 in section  [ nbody ] ) can be studied by using the linear version of cmbfast ; and , ( 4 ) the lensing due to scales smaller than @xmath257 , at redshift @xmath261 ( @xmath222 in section  [ nbody ] ) , can be computed using standard semi - analytical methods implemented in cmbfast .    given that our study has strongly focused on the @xmath220 signal",
    ", we exhaustively investigated the numerical issues involved when estimating this signal .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * the lensing contribution between @xmath132 and @xmath77 is negligible * for each rls , a few realizations suffice to get a good average @xmath49 spectrum and , moreover , each single simulation gives a very good spectrum rather similar to the average one * rlss , which are essentially identical except for the preferred directions , give similar spectra ( the ray - tracing procedure has little variance ) * simulation boxes of @xmath262 are not fully necessary for @xmath263 ; however , for @xmath211 , these large sizes lead to the most reliable spectra and , moreover , such sizes should lead to very good spectra in the @xmath4-interval ( @xmath264@xmath265 ) * simulations in boxes of @xmath159 lead to good @xmath49 spectra for @xmath266 * for @xmath267 , all the rlss lie in a region of width @xmath2680.5 @xmath237k , indicating that the rlss give consistent estimates of the signal in this range * the signal in the range @xmath269 is @xmath270k , which is @xmath271 @xmath237k higher than that found elsewhere ( @xcite )    despite some simulation uncertainties , our code and technique have lead to a robust estimate of the lensing effect in the @xmath4-interval @xmath272 , where it clearly dominates the primary anisotropy .",
    "moreover , the estimated power is larger than that obtained with semi - analytical methods and the cmbfast code .",
    "we thus suggest that the resulting value of a few micro - kelvin may explain the excess power at high @xmath4 in the bima and cbi observations .",
    "this conclusion is supported by recent studies based on the millennium simulation @xcite , where the authors have reported a small contribution from nonlinearity at @xmath273 .",
    "however , the methods of @xcite have been designed to build all - sky lensed maps , and do not have the resolution necessary to perform an accurate estimate of the weak lensing by strongly nonlinear structures in the @xmath4-interval where we have found our main effect .",
    "our direct estimation of the potential gradients at photon positions using pp corrections from the local dark matter particles appears to be the main origin of the difference between our results and other research relying either on planes or grid interpolations .",
    "however , we emphasize that differences only occur at the large @xmath274 values we have been investigating .",
    "our method employs extremely fine time resolution , namely that used by ap3 m simulations and also a very good angular resolution ( see above ) . due to current limitations in our method",
    "it is not possible for us to determine the precise role of temporal resolution in an accurate lensing calculation .",
    "it is well known that on small scales baryons do not follow the dark matter distribution .",
    "thus , while we have attempted to be as accurate as possible in this dark matter simulation , we are now probing scales where contributions from baryons are beginning to become significant .",
    "an investigation of the impact of baryons by @xcite considered two types of simulations , the first with non - radiative baryons while the second included dissipation and star formation .",
    "they found that for @xmath275 an effect of between 1% to 10% on the weak - lensing shear angular power spectrum , as calculated from dark matter alone , was possible .",
    "the largest difference was produced in the run with dissipation and star formation , where a 10% increase in the ( shear ) @xmath234s at @xmath169 was observed .",
    "future work is definitely necessary to determine the impact of this physics on lensing statistics .",
    "we plan to conduct simulations with baryons and feedback processes both to identify its impact on the signal we find , and also to systematically evaluate the combined impact of the sz effect and weak lensing .    for calculations that are accurate to high @xmath4",
    "it seems to be necessary to move cmb photons through the simulation box while structures are evolving , which ensures the spatial gradients are accurately calculated on the photon positions ( test particles ) . once the n - body code has been modified to compute spatial gradients at particle test positions , there are no theoretical or technical reasons to take a temporal resolution different from that defined by the simulation time step . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "the time step resolution is obviously most compatible with the n - body technique ( and thus takes into account the entire evolution of the simulation ) . from the technical point of view",
    ", the use of the time step resolution requires the minimum memory cost as the number of test particles between two successive times , although large , is minimized .",
    "because of these considerations , temporal resolution is not a parameter to be varied in our calculations .",
    "our ap3 m code adapted to cmb lensing calculations can be run for different values of the parameters defining the lss ; hence , this code allows us to see how the resulting angular power spectra depend on the parameters defining both the n - body simulation and the ray - tracing procedure .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for suggestions that improved the clarity and content of the paper .",
