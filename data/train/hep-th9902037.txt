    "the second difficulty we consider to be rather of technical nature , which should be solved by the introduction of some highly nontrivial unitary operator , representing the exchange of space  time position of two @xmath0deformed bosonic or fermionic particles ( for the solution of an analogous but much simpler problem see [ 24 ] ) .",
