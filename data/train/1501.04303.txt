    "in recent years , a significant research effort has been dedicated to the development of new flow energy - harvesting systems and the characterization of their efficiency .",
    "many of such systems are based on flow - induced vibrations of structures , such as vortex - induced vibrations @xcite , flutter of wing profiles @xcite , of cylinders in axial flows @xcite , or flags @xcite .",
    "the present work focuses on the latter , and considers a flag covered with piezoelectric patches that convert mechanical deformation into electric charge transfer inside an output circuit .    in this article the term _",
    "flag _ refers in fact to a clamped - free plate in an axial flow .",
    "it is well - established that such structure can undergo strong self - sustained oscillations once a critical flow velocity is overpassed ( see the recent review by ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these oscillations originate from an instability of the equilibrium position , resulting from the interaction of the flow forces with the solid s inertia and rigidity .",
    "this instability can be predicted from the linearized dynamics equations and different methods and models have been proposed depending on the aspect ratio of the flag , ranging from two - dimensional models ( large span , @xcite ) to slender body models ( short span , @xcite ) .",
    "the general case of a three dimensional fluid flow around a rectangular plate showed the limits of applicability of both models @xcite .",
    "linear analysis is however not able to predict the amplitude of flapping in the saturated regime , hence it is necessary to consider the nonlinear dynamics of the flag to be able to determine how much energy can be harvested . beyond full numerical simulations of the coupled fluid - solid problems ,",
    "simplified fluid - solid nonlinear models have been proposed in the limit of two - dimensional flows @xcite or slender body problems @xcite .",
    "piezoelectric patches have traditionally been studied to couple structural mechanics to electrical circuits in the context of passive damping of structural vibrations @xcite , of active control of vibrations @xcite and of course energy harvesting @xcite .",
    "the use of a piezoelectric flag to convert the kinetic energy of a flow was initially introduced by ref .",
    "@xcite , to produce energy from the flapping of a flexible membrane forced by the wake of an upstream obstacle . in the last five years ,",
    "several experimental , numerical and theoretical studies have been conducted to study the possibility to exploit the flutter instability itself using piezoelectric plates @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the plate was either entirely or partially covered by one piezoelectric pair @xcite , or completely covered by a large amount of small piezoelectric elements , so that a continuous model for a homogenous plate can be considered @xcite . in the latter case and for purely resistive output circuits , it was shown that the maximum efficiency is obtained for large mass ratio when the timescale of the electrical circuit is equal to the fluid - solid instability timescale @xcite . for practical applications , however",
    ", only a finite number of piezoelectric elements can realistically be used .",
    "the goal of the present article is therefore to provide some understanding on the impact of such a discrete coverage on the dynamics and performance of the system , a critical question that has remained so far unanswered .",
    "in contrast with simplified representations of the energy harvesting process ( e.g. pure damping , @xcite ) , such an approach provides a fully - coupled description of the fluid - solid - electric problem , taking into account both the transfer of energy from the solid motion to the output circuit and the feedback effect of the piezoelectric patches on the flag s dynamics .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics of the flag ( even in the absence of any piezoelectric coupling ) exhibit strong inhomogeneities of the local deformation and motion along the plate : near the clamped leading edge , the flag has little displacement but significant curvature , while near the free trailing edge , the flag has zero curvature but undergoes large displacements .",
    "local stretching and compression of the piezoelectric patches resulting from the flag deformation are responsible for the charge transfer in the output circuit ; the location along the structure of the device converting mechanical to electrical energy is therefore expected to strongly affect the efficiency of the system .",
    "a similar question was recently addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite in the case of a pure damping model .",
    "the present work focuses on the optimization of the distribution of a small set of piezoelectric elements ( one , two or three pairs ) positioned on a plate in an axial flow . in section [ sec : model ] , the physical model and equations are presented for the fluid - solid - electric system with a finite number of discrete piezoelectric patches .",
    "a method of simulation based on the weakly nonlinear form of these equations is presented that is appropriate to obtain the nonlinear dynamics near the instability threshold .",
    "the influence of the number of piezoelectric elements on the stability of the system is investigated in section [ sec : stability ] . in section [ sec : geom ] , the impact of this arrangement on the nonlinear dynamics and energy harvesting efficiency is studied using experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "finally , a parametric numerical study is performed to determine the optimal arrangements in the case of one , two or three piezoelectric elements .",
    "the system considered in this work consists of an elastic flexible plate of length @xmath0 and width @xmath1 immersed in an axial flow of uniform density @xmath2 and velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the plate is inextensible and clamped at its leading edge . for simplicity",
    "only purely two - dimensional motions of the plate are considered .",
    "the plate s geometry is therefore completely determined by the local orientation of the plate with respect to the flow , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the curvilinear coordinate along the plate and @xmath6 is time .",
    "a finite number @xmath7 of piezoelectric electrodes of length @xmath8 and width @xmath1 are attached on each side of the plate . for each piezoelectric patch pair",
    ", the negative electrodes are shunted across the plate while their positive electrodes are connected to an external circuit . the charge ( per unit length in the streamwise direction ) in each piezo pair is given by @xcite : @xmath9_{s_i^-}^{s_i^+}+cv_i\\ ; , \\label{eq_piezo}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 the voltage between the positive electrodes of the _ _ i__th piezo pair whose left and right edges are positioned at @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "@xmath13 is the equivalent capacitance per unit length of the piezo pair and @xmath14 is the mechanical / piezoelectrical conversion factor of the piezoelectric material .",
    "considering that each electrode is connected to a purely resistive circuit , ohm s law leads to : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the conductivity per unit length of the harvesting circuit , with @xmath17 the circuit s resistance .",
    "the voltage @xmath10 between the positive electrodes also generates an internal torque in the piezoelectric patches , and thus on the flexible plate , so that the total internal torque in the plate and piezoelectric patches assembly is obtained as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the flexural rigidity , which depends on the respective thickness , young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the two constitutive materials @xcite . in equation",
    ", @xmath20 is the polarization function of the _ _ i__th patch . in the present approach , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the heaviside step function .",
    "the conservation of momentum then leads to @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the local plate position and @xmath25 is the mass per unit length of the assembly .",
    "@xmath26 is the internal tension in the plate that enforces inextensibility and @xmath27 is the pressure force density exerted by the surrounding fluid over the plate . in eq .  , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the unit normal and tangent vectors to the plate ( see figure [ esquema ] ) . following previous works on flapping flag modeling @xcite",
    ", @xmath27 is decomposed into a reactive part @xmath30 accounting for potential flow effects ( e.g. added mass ) , corrected by a resistive part @xmath31 accounting for the form drag on the plate resulting from lateral flow separation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the added mass coefficient of the transverse section ( @xmath34 for a rectangular plate @xcite ) , and @xmath35 the drag coefficient @xcite . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the normal and longitudinal components of the plate s velocity relative to the fluid flow , such that @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the unitary vector in the @xmath40 direction .    in the present approach , it is assumed that the electrode does not affect the density and bending rigidity of the sandwich plate that are considered homogeneous along the assembly ( see @xcite for a study on the passive damping of vibrating beams including this effect ) . also , in the approach followed in this work , @xmath31 accounts for the effect of the lateral flow detachment in the form of a drag . flow detachment from the trailing edge and wake dynamics",
    "are only accounted through the reactive term which models the advection of added fluid momentum ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "other models exist that consider the influence of an unsteady wake @xcite .      using @xmath0 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 as characteristic length , time , voltage and charge respectively , equations  become in non - dimensional form : @xmath44_{s_i^-}^{s_i^+},\\label{eq_piezo_adim}\\\\ \\beta\\frac{\\partial q_i}{\\partial t}+v_i & = 0,\\label{eq_circ_adim}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial t^2 } & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}(f_\\tau\\boldsymbol{\\tau})-\\frac{1}{u^{*2}}\\frac{\\partial^ 2}{\\partial s^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial s}\\mathbf{n}\\right)-\\left(m^ * p_{\\text{res } } + m^ * h^*m_ap_{\\text{reac}}\\right)\\mathbf{n } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\;\\;\\;\\ ; + \\frac{\\alpha}{u^*}\\sum_i v_i\\left[\\delta'(s - s_i^-)-\\delta'(s - s_i^+)\\right]\\mathbf{n},\\label{eq_plaque_adim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with clamped - free boundary conditions .",
    "the problem is characterized by the following non - dimensional parameters : @xmath45      equation ( [ eq_plaque_adim ] ) is projected onto the @xmath40 and @xmath46 directions in order to obtain two equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "the horizontal projection is used to eliminate the tension term @xmath49 from the @xmath46 projection .",
    "finally , @xmath40 and its derivatives are eliminated using the inextensibility condition . keeping terms up to @xmath50",
    "one obtains a weakly non - linear equation for @xmath48 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a non - piezoelectric plate ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 equation   corresponds to the linearized dynamics while equations   correspond to nonlinearities related to inertia , stiffness , piezoelectric coupling , resistive and reactive flow effects , respectively .",
    "a galerkin decomposition is used to solve equation  : the vertical displacement @xmath46 is expanded as a superposition of clamped - free beam eigenmodes @xmath53 , @xmath54 next , equation ( [ ydest ] ) is projected on the same set of eigenmodes .",
    "details of the galerkin projection can be found in [ galerkin - projection ] .",
    "after truncation to @xmath55 linear modes , the resulting coupled system of equations is integrated numerically using a semi - implicit step - adaptive fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "once the dynamics of the piezoelectric flag is obtained using the method above and a limit - cycle oscillation is reached , the total energy harvested by the system is computed as the energy dissipated in all the resistive circuits . in dimensional form , this reads as @xmath56 with @xmath57 the temporal average over one oscillation period .",
    "the harvesting efficiency @xmath58 is then computed as the fraction of the fluid kinetic energy flux @xmath59 through the vertical cross - section occupied by the flag that is actually harvested and dissipated in the output circuits . using the non - dimensional variables defined above , this",
    "can be written as @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 the flapping amplitude of the flag .",
    "as a first validation of our model , we investigate the effect of the piezoelectric arrangement of the flag on its stability for a continuous coverage ( @xmath63 ) , and a large number of piezoelectric patches . beyond a critical value @xmath64 of the flow velocity",
    "the system becomes unstable to flutter @xcite .",
    "figure [ lin - stab - an ] ( left ) shows the critical velocity @xmath65 as a function of the mass ratio @xmath66 for different values of the coupling coefficient and a large number of small piezoelectric patches ( @xmath67 ) . without piezoelectric coupling ,",
    "@xmath65 is a decreasing function of @xmath66 .",
    "cusps in the curve represent a switch in the mode becoming unstable at the lowest flow velocity ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these results match that obtained in ref .  @xcite using a continuous model , thus indicating that for a large amount of piezoelectric patches , the present discrete model indeed converges to the continuous framework .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "this article investigated the possibility of converting kinetic energy of a flow into electrical energy through elastic deformation of a fluttering plate using piezoelectric effect , a problem that has received growing attention in recent years .",
    "a critical question lies in the optimization of the energy transfers between the fluid , solid and electric circuit .",
    "the present work focused on the role and influence of the location of the piezoelectric electrodes on the efficiency of the harvester , explicitly describing the discrete nature of the piezoelectric coverage of the flag and hence , allowing for a better representation of the experimental and practical situations .    to address this problem ,",
    "the present work used a combination of theoretical analysis and experiments .",
    "a weakly nonlinear model considering a plate with a discrete number of piezoelectric patches pairs was developed and confronted to the experimental results .",
    "it was then used to determine geometries that maximize the energy harvesting efficiency in three different test cases : ( 1 ) one electrode partially covering the plate , ( 2 ) two electrodes fully covering the plate and ( 3 ) three electrodes fully covering the plate . for each configuration , the optimal geometries were described and analyzed .",
    "the results presented in this work emphasize the critical role of the piezoelectric elements positioning : because the electric charge transfer responsible for the powering of the output circuit is solely given by the relative change of orientation of the flag between both ends of the patch , the placement of this patch must be carefully designed to take full advantage of the non - uniform flag deformation and its specificities , in particular the dependence of the mode shape with the mass ratio . in the case of a single electrode and small values of the mass ratio , the present study in fact shows that a greater amount of energy can be harvested when positioning the electrodes on the downstream half of the flag . at a higher value of the mass ratio , more than one optimal positioning are found , which is a consequence of more spatial oscillations of the unstable mode shape .",
    "using a larger number of electrodes allows to improve the efficiency of the system particularly for higher mass ratios , where the modal structure corresponds to a shorter wavelength and is therefore better suited to shorter electrodes that are able to capture the flag s deformation best .",
    "the work in this paper extends the results obtained in the context of damping or energy harvesting of vibrating plates in still fluid @xcite to flow - induced instabilities and more than one piezoelectric patch .",
    "the present results allow to conclude that the optimal location for piezoelectric energy harvesting along the plate is on the downstream half , and in that regard are reminiscent of the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained for a pure damping model of the energy harvesting process . in both cases , the local deformation of the flag is driving the energy harvesting process , either through changes in the local curvature or in the relative orientation at both ends of the piezoelectric patches , and the response of the deformation of the flag to the presence of energy harvesting plays a critical role in determining the optimal location for large coupling coefficient . both approaches however differ in the relevant measure of flag deformation ( either curvature or relative orientation ) , which also impacts the detail of the optimal location for the damping or piezoelectric patches .    in the case of weakly coupled systems",
    ", it was also shown that the amount of harvested energy can be directly predicted from the kinematics of the flapping flag obtained for zero piezoelectric coupling . maximizing the harvested energy hence requires to determine the positioning that will ensure a maximum relative variation of the orientation between the two ends of the piezoelectric components . in the case of strongly coupled system , the positioning of the electrodes may influence the flapping amplitude , and consequently the efficiency , because of the feedback effect of the piezoelectric patches on the flag dynamics .",
    "near the stability threshold , the flapping amplitude can be directly related to the critical velocity fluctuations : in that regard , linear stability analysis may be a great tool to estimate the impact of the piezoelectric coverage on the efficiency in the case of large coupling .",
