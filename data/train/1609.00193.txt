    "lorentz invariance is one of the foundations of einstein s special relativity .",
    "it has been tested to a high accuracy using both the laboratory and cosmos experiments . in some quantum gravity theories",
    "@xcite , however , lorentz invariance may be broken .",
    "in such a case , the propagation of light in vacuum exhibits a nontrivial dispersion relation compared to that in the special relativity .",
    "one of the most extensively discussed dispersion relation with lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the planck energy , and @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "according to this dispersion relation , the group velocity of light in vacuum , @xmath11 , is no longer a constant , but is energy dependent .",
    "therefore , two photons with different energies emitted simultaneously from a cosmological source will have a slightly time delay when they arrive the earth .",
    "such a time delay should be detectable if the source is far enough away from the earth .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) provide an effect tool to test lorentz invariance . as one of the most energetic explosions in the universe , grbs are detectable out to redshift @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , grbs have been widely used to constrain liv effect @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath10 constrained in this way is usually in the order of unity .",
    "the strictest limit on the liv energy scale from grb 090510 is @xmath13 gev @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "much tighter constraints can be obtained through the measurement of grb polarization .",
    "the polarimetric observations show that photons in the prompt emission of some grbs are highly linearly polarized .",
    "for example , the polarization degree of the first reported highly polarized burst , grb 021206 , is about @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , a following re - analysis of the same data found no significant polarization signal @xcite . the highest polarized burst reported so far is grb 041219a , which has polarization degree @xmath16 @xcite . but",
    "again this result was criticized by a more detailed analysis @xcite . in 2011 ,",
    "the gamma - ray burst polarimeter _ gap _",
    "@xcite onboard the japanese interplanetary kite - craft accelerated by radiation of the sun ( ikaros ) detected two highly polarized bursts , grb 110301a and 110721a .",
    "these two bursts have conform polarization degree of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of polarization has also been observed @xcite .",
    "although the uncertainty is still large and many controversies exist , the possibility that some grbs are highly polarized ca nt be excluded . the high accuracy @xmath19-ray polarimeter _ polar _ @xcite onboard the chinese space laboratory tiangong - ii is fully designed to measure the grb polarization in @xmath20 kev energy band .",
    "it is scheduled to launch in september , 2016 . if _",
    "polar _ is launched , the grb polarimetric data will be significantly enlarged , and the statistical significance will be highly improved . in the theoretical aspect , several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the grb polarization @xcite .",
    "if grbs are really highly polarized , it will give a strict constraint on liv effect .",
    "the idea of using polarization to constrain liv was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "they analysed the polarimetric data in ultraviolet band for radio galaxy 3c 256 locating at a redshift of 1.82 , and obtained @xmath21 .",
    "when lorentz invariance is broken , the polarization vector ( i.e. , the electric component ) of a photon will rotate during its propagation .",
    "suppose a beam of photons emit from a grb source and propagate to the observer on earth .",
    "every photon will rotates its polarization vector by an angle @xmath22 , which depends on the photon energy .",
    "let @xmath0 to be the difference of rotation angles of polarization vectors between the highest energy photon and the lowest energy photon .",
    "if high polarization degree is observed , then @xmath0 could nt be too large , otherwise the net polarization will be severely suppressed .",
    "@xcite set the upper limit of @xmath0 to be @xmath1 , and obtained a strict upper limit on the value @xmath10 in the order of @xmath23 from the polarimetric data of three grbs .",
    "however , the grbs used by @xcite have no direct measurement of redshift , while redshift deduced from the empirical luminosity correlations has large uncertainty .",
    "@xcite used the polarization data of grb 061122 locating at a redshift @xmath24 , and obtained @xmath25 . using the most distant polarized burst , grb 140206a , which has a confirm redshift measurement of @xmath26 ,",
    "@xcite have obtained the strictest constraint to date , i , e .",
    ", @xmath27 .",
    "all of these constraints are based on the assumption that the rotation angle @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "then a question arises : how much polarization degree can be conserved if the polarization vector changes an angle @xmath0 ?",
    "the main aim of our paper is to address this question",
    ". we will give a detailed calculation on the evolution of grb polarization as a function of @xmath0 , and show that a considerable amount of polarization ( depending on the photon energy band ) can be conserved even if @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the rest parts of this paper are arranged as follows : in section [ sec : general ] , we present the general formulae for the evolution of polarization induced by liv effect . in section [ sec : special ] , we employ the formulae to grbs , which usually have power - law spectra in the energy band of @xmath28 kev .",
    "three different cases are discussed : ( 1 ) photons are initially completely unpolarized , ( 2 ) photons are initially completely polarized , and ( 3 ) photons are initially partially polarized .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "one of the most discussed , lorentz invariance violating dispersion relation of photon can be parameterized as @xcite @xmath29 where  @xmath30 \" represents the left - handed or right - handed states , @xmath31 gev is the planck energy , and @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the magnitude of liv effect .",
    "the helicity dependence of photon velocity will lead to the vacuum birefringence effect , such that the polarization vector of a photon will rotate during the propagation .",
    "the rotation angle of polarization vector for a photon with energy @xmath32 ( in unit of @xmath33 ) propagating from the source at redshift @xmath34 to the observer on earth is given by @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the observed photon energy , @xmath37 is the hubble constant , and @xmath38 throughout this paper , we take @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 from the planck 2015 results @xcite .",
    "suppose a beam of non - coherent light emits from the source .",
    "choose the propagation direction as the @xmath34-axis , and the polarization direction is in the @xmath42-plane .",
    "the intensity of photons whose electric vector is in the infinitesimal azimuth angle interval @xmath43 , and whose energy is in the infinitesimal interval @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the photon number spectrum , @xmath47 is a periodic function of @xmath48 with period @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is a normalization constant . since photon intensity is proportional to the square of electric vector , the intensity projected onto the direction of azimuth angle @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 therefore , the total intensity of photons polarized along the direction @xmath51 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the lower and upper limits of photon spectrum , respectively .",
    "the polarization degree is defined by @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the maximum and minimum of @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "as photons propagate from the source to the observer on earth , every photon will change its polarization vector according to equation ( [ eq : delta - theta ] ) .",
    "let @xmath60 to be the rotation angle of the electric vector of the highest energy photon with respect to that of the lowest energy photon , then equation ( [ eq : delta - theta ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath61 the received photon intensity can be obtained from equation ( [ eq : intensity3 ] ) by replacing @xmath47 with @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 therefore , the observed polarization degree is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the maximum and minimum of @xmath67 , respectively .    as a trivial example ,",
    "let us consider the monochromatic photons . in this case",
    ", the photon spectrum can be written as the dirac @xmath68-function @xmath69 substituting equation ( [ eq : mono - spectrum ] ) into equation ( [ eq : intensity3 ] ) , we obtain the initial light beam @xmath70 substituting equation ( [ eq : mono - spectrum ] ) into equation ( [ eq : intensity4 ] ) , we obtain the received light beam @xmath71 noticing @xmath72 , through a simple calculation we can easily verify @xmath73 .",
    "this means that @xmath74 is identical to @xmath75 except that the polarization direction is shifted by an angle @xmath76 , while the polarization degree does not change .",
    "this is in our expectation , because all the photons change the same polarization angle when the light beam is monochromatic .",
    "in this section , we focus on discussing the polarization evolution of grb photons . the photon spectrum of a typical grb in a wide energy range ( from a few kev to tens mev )",
    "can be well described by the band function @xcite , which is a two smoothly jointed power laws cutting at a breaking energy . in the kev energy band , in which the polarization is measured ,",
    "the band function is well approximated by two power laws , i.e. , @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the breaking energy , @xmath0 and @xmath82 are the power - law indices . for a typical grb , @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the working energy band of most @xmath19-ray polarimeters at present is very narrow .",
    "in such a narrow energy band , the spectrum can even be well modelled by the simple power law , i.e. , @xmath85 . for simplicity , in the following we assume that the grb spectrum is the simple power law , and the index @xmath32 can vary from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "three initial polarization states are considered : ( 1 ) initially completely unpolarized , ( 2 ) initially completely polarized , and ( 3 ) initially partially polarized .    *",
    "initially completely unpolarized * if photon beam is initially completely unpolarized , then @xmath47 is independent of @xmath48 . without loss of generality",
    ", we take @xmath88 . using @xmath89 and",
    "@xmath88 , equation ( [ eq : intensity3 ] ) simplifies to @xmath90 similarly , equation ( [ eq : intensity4 ] ) simplifies to @xmath91 we may see that @xmath74 is identical to @xmath75 , and both are independent of @xmath51 . hence , initially unpolarized photons are always unpolarized duration the propagation .    *",
    "initially completely polarized * if photon beam is initially completely polarized , e.g. , along the @xmath92-axis , then @xmath47 can be written as - functions ensures that @xmath47 is periodic , i.e. , @xmath72 . ]",
    "@xmath93 substituting @xmath89 and equation ( [ eq : f - theta ] ) into equation ( [ eq : intensity3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath94 we can easily see that @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which means that the initial polarization degree is @xmath97 . substituting @xmath89 and equations ( [ eq : delta - theta2 ] ) and ( [ eq : f - theta ] ) into equation ( [ eq : intensity4 ] ) , we obtain the observed photon intensity @xmath98    for any given @xmath0 , we can numerically calculate the maximum and minimum values of @xmath67 , then calculate the polarization degree according to equation ( [ eq : polarization2 ] ) .",
    "we plot the polarization degree as a function of @xmath0 in figure [ fig : pi_alpha1 ] .         in the upper panel of figure [ fig : pi_alpha1 ] ,",
    "the power - law index is fixed at @xmath99 .",
    "curves for four energy bands are shown : @xmath100 kev , @xmath101 kev , @xmath102 kev and @xmath20 kev .",
    "the last two are the working energy bands of the _ ikaros - gap _ , and the _ polar _ , respectively .",
    "the polarization degree @xmath103 decreases rapidly as @xmath0 increases , and reaches a local minimum at @xmath2 .",
    "after that , @xmath103 increases until @xmath3 , then decreases again until @xmath4 , etc .",
    "the polarization degree as a function of @xmath0 oscillates with a quasi - period @xmath5 , and the oscillating amplitude gradually decreases to zero . in the range @xmath104 ,",
    "polarization degree is almost independent of photon energy .",
    "more than @xmath6 of the initial polarization is conserved at @xmath105 .",
    "when @xmath106 , the energy dependence of polarization is evident . comparing the dot - dashed ( @xmath100 kev ) and dotted ( @xmath101 kev ) lines , we may see that for the same energy width , high energy photons have smaller polarization than low energy photons at the fixed rotation angle @xmath0 .",
    "this is because high energy photons rotate a larger absolute polarization angle @xmath107 ( see equation ( [ eq : delta - theta ] ) ) than low energy photons propagating the same distance .",
    "therefore , the polarization direction of high energy photons are more mixed and the polarization degree are suppressed .",
    "comparing the dotted ( @xmath101 kev ) , dashed ( @xmath102 kev ) and solid ( @xmath20 kev ) lines , we may see that at a fixed rotation angle , photons in a wider energy band have larger polarization .    to see the possible dependence of polarization degree on the power - law index , we plot in the lower panel of figure [ fig : pi_alpha1 ] for different values of @xmath32 , while the photons are assumed to be in the energy band @xmath108 $ ] kev .",
    "it is clearly shown that the net polarization degree increases as @xmath32 increase .",
    "this is easy to understand .",
    "when @xmath32 is larger , the photons are closer to monochromatic . while we have already showed that in the strictly monochromatic case , polarization degree does not change during the propagation .",
    "therefore , to tightly constrain the liv effect , grbs with soft spectrum ( i.e. smaller @xmath32 value ) are favored .",
    "although at the fixed rotation angle , photons in a wider energy band have larger polarization degree , it does not mean that we can indeed see larger polarization in a wider energy band .",
    "this is because a wider energy band will lead to a larger rotation angle . to see this more clearly",
    ", we plot , in the upper panel of figure [ fig : pi_xi1 ] , the polarization as a function of @xmath10 in four energy bands .",
    "the power - law index is taken to be @xmath99 , and the redshift of the source is assumed to be @xmath109 .",
    "similar to the @xmath110 plot , the @xmath111 plot also shows oscillation .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath110 plot , in which the oscillating period is almost independent of photon energy , in the @xmath111 plot a higher and wider energy band has a smaller period . at the beginning ,",
    "the polarization degree decreases rapidly as @xmath10 increases .",
    "a higher and wider energy band shows a steeper slope . at large @xmath10 , where the net polarization is below @xmath112 , curves of different energy bands intersect with each other complexly . to see the redshift dependence , in the lower panel of figure [ fig : pi_xi1 ]",
    ", we plot the polarization degree as a function of @xmath10 for various redshifts .",
    "as is expected , the polarization degree decreases more rapidly at higher redshift .",
    "* initially partially polarized * if photon beam is initially partially polarized , the concrete form of @xmath47 depends on the initial polarization degree .",
    "we consider that photons are initially half polarized . in this case , we may choose @xmath113 . using @xmath89 and",
    "@xmath113 , equation ( [ eq : intensity3 ] ) simplifies to @xmath114 we can see that @xmath95 and @xmath115 .",
    "the initial polarization degree , according to the definition in equation ( [ eq : polarization1 ] ) , is @xmath116 .",
    "substituting @xmath89 and @xmath113 into equation ( [ eq : intensity4 ] ) , and noticing that @xmath117 is given by equation ( [ eq : delta - theta2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath118.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for any given @xmath0 , we numerically calculate @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then calculate the polarization degree according to equation ( [ eq : polarization2 ] ) .",
    "we plot the polarization degree as a function of @xmath0 in figure [ fig : pi_alpha3 ] .",
    "in the upper panel , we plot the polarization for various energy bands , while the power - law index is fixed at @xmath99 . in the lower panel ,",
    "we show the polarization degree for various values of @xmath32 , while the photons are assumed to be in the energy band @xmath119 $ ] kev . comparing with figure [ fig : pi_alpha1 ]",
    ", we may see that the tendencies of polarization evolving with rotation angle in these two cases are very similar .",
    "polarization degree as a function of @xmath0 oscillates with a quasi - period @xmath5 , and the oscillating amplitude decreases to zero gradually . polarization has local minimums at @xmath120 , and has local maximums at @xmath121 . at @xmath105 ,",
    "the polarization degree is larger than @xmath122 .",
    "this is to say , more than @xmath6 of the initial polarization can be conserved at @xmath105 .",
    "the first local minimum locates at @xmath2 , whose value depends on the photon energy . at the same energy band ,",
    "a hard spectrum has a larger net polarization . at the fixed rotation angle ,",
    "photons in a wider energy band have larger polarization .",
    "all these futures are very similar to that in the initially completely polarized case .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig : pi_alpha3 ] seems to be identical to figure [ fig : pi_alpha1 ] , except that the ordinate is suppressed by a factor of @xmath123 .",
    "this makes intuitive sense because the half polarized photons can be regarded as the mixture of @xmath124 completely polarized photons and @xmath124 completely unpolarized photons .",
    "the polarization degree of the initially completely polarized photons evolves according to figure [ fig : pi_alpha1 ] , while the initially completely unpolarized photons keep unpolarized during the propagation .",
    "we also plot the polarization as a function of @xmath10 in figure [ fig : pi_xi3 ] .         in the upper panel ,",
    "the redshift of source is @xmath109 , and different curves stand for different energy bands .",
    "in the lower panel , the photons are in the energy band @xmath108 $ ] kev , and different curves stand for different redshifts of the source . in both panels ,",
    "the power - law index is fixed at @xmath99 .",
    "we may see that the evolution of polarization during the propagation is also similar to that in the initially completely polarized case .",
    "firstly , the polarization degree decreases rapidly until reaching a local minimum as @xmath10 increases .",
    "the wider energy band has a steeper slope , but has a larger local minimum .",
    "after the first local minimum , the polarization degree oscillates with @xmath10 , while the oscillating amplitude gradually vanishes .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the evolution of grb polarization arising from liv effect .",
    "the birefringence of light leads to the rotation of polarization vector duration propagation .",
    "we obtained the net polarization degree as a function of the rotation angle @xmath0 , where @xmath0 represents the relative rotation angle of high - energy and low - energy photons .",
    "we showed that the net polarization degree decreases rapidly as @xmath0 increases until @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath0 continuously increases , the polarization degree oscillates with a quasi - period @xmath125 and a gradually vanishing amplitude .",
    "more than @xmath6 of the intrinsic polarization degree can be conserved at @xmath105 .",
    "this is in conflict with the intuition that @xmath0 could nt be larger than @xmath1 when high polarization degree is observed .",
    "hence , it is inappropriate to simply use @xmath1 as the upper limit to constrain liv effect , especially when the photon energy band is wide and the spectrum is hard .",
    "photons in a wider energy band have larger net polarization at the fixed @xmath0 .",
    "however , for a specific source , a wider energy band will also have a larger @xmath0 .",
    "the net effect is that photons in a wider energy band have a lower polarization degree .",
    "therefore , the polarimetric observation in a wide energy band is favourable in constraining liv .",
    "in addition , we found that grbs with soft spectrum and high redshift are helpful to tightly constrain liv .",
    "the compact space - borne compton polarimeter _ polar _ onboard the chinese space laboratory tiangong - ii is a high accuracy @xmath19-ray polarimeter fully designed to measure the polarization of grb in @xmath20 kev energy band . if a grb at redshift @xmath126 is observed by _ polar _ with @xmath124 polarization degree , and if the spectrum in the _ polar _ energy band follows the power - law distribution with index @xmath127 , then we can obtain the most conservative upper limit of liv effect @xmath128",
    "this is obtained by assuming that the grb is intrinsically completely polarized .",
    "otherwise , the constraint may be much tighter .",
    "we apply our formulae to some true grb events .",
    "@xcite claimed to have detected a polarization degree of @xmath129 in grb 110721a in the _ ikaros - gap _ energy band @xmath130 $ ] kev .",
    "the photon spectrum in this energy band can be well fitted by the simple power law , with the power - law index @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the redshift of this burst has not been directly measured .",
    "the @xmath132 lower limit of redshift inferred from the amati relation is 0.45 @xcite . using these observational values , and assuming that photons are initially completely polarized , we obtain the upper limit of liv effect @xmath133 .",

    "the most conservative upper limit of liv effect constrained from this burst is @xmath140 .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that in this paper , we only consider one type of liv , i.e. , doubly special relativity .",
    "the dispersion relation in equation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) breaks not only the lorentz invariance , but also the cpt invariance .",
    "this case is not typically favored by theorists .",
    "it is widely discussed because it is one of the few theories of quantum gravity that can be tested .",
    "more importantly , the dispersion relation considered here is among the few which has the vacuum birefringence effect .",
    "if the vacuum birefringence effect does not exist , and the polarization vector does not rotate during the propagation , then the polarimetric observation could nt be used to constrain liv .",
