    "the texas supernova search ( tss ; quimby et al . 2005 ) and its successor , the rotse - supernova verification project ( rsvp ; yuan et al .",
    "2007 ) , discovered a new class of super - luminous supernovae ( slsne ) . the advantage of the tss / rsvp project is that it is essentially free of selection bias and the limits of a targeted search . the automated wide field ( 3.4 square degree ) rotse - iii telescopes ( akerlof et al .",
    "2003 ) scan the whole sky , looking for transients down to @xmath719  mag .",
    "they do not focus on pre - selected galaxies nor omit galaxy centers .",
    "the first tss / rsvp discoveries in this new class of slsne were sn  2005ap ( quimby et al . 2007a ) , sn  2006gy ( quimby 2006 ; smith et al .",
    "2007 ) , sn  2006tf ( quimby , castro & mondol 2007 ; quimby et al .",
    "2007b ; smith et al .",
    "2008 ) and sn  2008es ( yuan et al . 2008b ; gezari et al . 2009 ; miller et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these exceptionally luminous supernovae are rare , with an estimated rate of @xmath10  events  mpc@xmath11  yr@xmath2 ( quimby et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the slsne introduced new modes of stellar death .",
    "traditional ideas about the mechanisms that can power supernova luminosity were found to be inadequate to explain the observed properties of these events .",
    "the small , but growing , sample of slsne is heterogeneous .",
    "some show strong emission lines of hydrogen in their spectra close to maximum light ( sn  2006gy , sn  2006tf , sn  2008fz , sn  2008iy ) and typically belong to the type  iin subclass ; some show hydrogen in later phases and a linear decline of the light curve expressed in magnitudes ( sn  2008es ) .",
    "others may show no hydrogen at all ( sn  2005ap , scp06f6 ) .",
    "for the super - luminous type  iin events , the energy generation mechanism is very likely the interaction between the ejecta and a circumstellar medium ( csm ) that was shed by the progenitor star in the years prior to the explosion ( chevalier & fransson 2003 ) .",
    "sn  2006gy triggered discussions about the possibility of nearby pair - instability supernovae ( smith et al .",
    "such models proved unsatisfactory for sn  2006gy and many other slsne , but may account for sn  2007bi ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2009 ; young et al . 2010 ) . even for some events that do not show clear signs of csm interaction , simple radioactive decay diffusion models ( arnett 1982 ; valenti et al .",
    "2008 ) have proven inconsistent with the observations ( quimby et al .",
    "2007a ; gezari et al .",
    "2009 ; quimby et al .",
    "other mechanisms that can account for the large luminosity have been proposed : interaction between expelled shells ( woosley , blinnikov & heger 2007 ) ; interaction between a grb - like jet and the progenitor envelope ( young et al . 2005 ; gezari et al .",
    "2009 ) ; a buried magnetar ( kasen & bildsten 2010 ; woosley 2010 ) ; or a very energetic core - collapse explosion ( umeda & nomoto 2008 ; moriya et al . 2010 ) .",
    "in addition , the possibility that many type  iin sne ( of normal or high luminosity ) have been spectroscopically confused with radio - quiet low - luminosity blazars has been discussed ( filippenko 1989 ) .",
    "all recent slsne candidates have shown spectroscopic features that are more consistent with sne .    in the present work",
    ", we report on sn  2008am discovered by rsvp ( yuan et al .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn  2008am and discuss the evolution of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in ",
    "3 we consider the nature of the emission - line features and models to account for the line profiles , and in  4 we discuss the applicability of various models to account for the light curve . finally , in  5 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the host of sn  2008am is sdss j122836.32 + 153449.6 that appears to be a faint , extended object in the sloan digital sky survey , with an r@xmath12 magnitude of @xmath720 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the position of the centroid of the host is @xmath13  12@xmath1428@xmath1536.3@xmath16 and @xmath17  + 15@xmath1834@xmath1550@xmath16 and its redshift is @xmath0  0.2338 ( yuan et al .",
    "2008a ;  2.4 ) .",
    "we estimate the luminosity distance of the sn to be 1130 mpc assuming a @xmath19-cdm cosmology with @xmath20  0.73 , @xmath21  0.27 and @xmath22  73  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 . on that basis",
    ", the host has an absolute magnitude @xmath4  -20  mag and thus is not a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the morphology of this galaxy is unknown , but the shape of its sdss photometric sed and the optical spectrum showing narrow emission features of h , [ nii ] , [ oii ] and [ oiii ] agree well with an sb1 galaxy template spectrum ( figure 9 ;  2.4 ) .",
    "the metallicity of the host , estimated from the flux ratios of these narrow emission features , is sub - solar ( @xmath5  0.4  @xmath6 ) , similar to the hosts of other slsne ( neill et al .",
    "2010 ; stoll et al . 2010 ;  2.4 ) .",
    "sn  2008am was discovered in unfiltered rotse - iiib images on 2008 jan 10.4 ut ( @xmath23  54475.4 ; yuan et al .",
    "2008a ) when it had an unfiltered magnitude of 18.7 .",
    "the position of the sn in the rotse images was determined to be @xmath13  12@xmath1428@xmath1536.25@xmath16 and @xmath17  + 15@xmath1834@xmath1549.1@xmath16 , slightly offset from the center of its host that appears in the sdss catalog ( figure 1 ) .",
    "rotse - iiib continued to gather unfiltered photometric data for @xmath7200 days after discovery .",
    "the rotse - iiib photometry is summarized in table 1 .",
    "the rotse data are shown in figure 2 along with the detection limits over the course of the photometry .",
    "the rotse - iiib photometry includes an early upper limit and data points during the rising phase of the supernova light curve that can be used to constrain the explosion date of the sn .",
    "to determine the explosion date , we converted the rotse magnitudes to luminosities assuming zero bolometric correction , and fit radioactive decay diffusion models (  4.1 ) to the resulting light curve .",
    "the fitting parameters are the effective diffusion time , the nickel mass , the explosion date and a parameter that controls the gamma - ray leakage .",
    "the best fit radioactive - decay diffusion model is shown in figure 3 .",
    "this fitting process yields an explosion date of @xmath24  54438.8@xmath25  1 , approximately 18 days prior to the first real detection in the observed frame and about 14 days in the rest frame .",
    "we note that this model was employed only to determine the explosion date of the sn and may not account for the real physical situation in sn  2008am ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "the rotse - iiib maximum occurred at @xmath23  54480.4 ( 2008 jan 15.0 ) , about 34 rest - frame days after the explosion . at the distance of 1130 mpc for",
    "the rotse unfiltered peak magnitude of 18.0  mag , the absolute rotse peak magnitude of sn  2008am is @xmath2622.3  mag ( uncorrected for extinction ) .",
    "the rotse response curve peaks in the red and it is calibrated to the usno - b1.0 system ( smith et al . 2003 ) .",
    "there is always a slight offset from a true r magnitude due to the fact that the shape of a supernova sed is very different from the reference stars used by rotse , but , to a good approximation , this absolute peak magnitude is close to the real absolute r magnitude of the event .",
    "this establishes that sn  2008am is a super - luminous event ; one of the most luminous supernovae ever discovered , placing the supernova in the family of slsne together with sn  1992ar ( clocchiatti et al .",

    "2010 ) .",
    "sn  2008am was followed up with photometric observations ranging from the ultraviolet ( uv ) through the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the peters automated infrared imaging telescope ( pairitel ; bloom et al .",
    "2006 ) obtained _ j _ , _ h _ and _ k@xmath8 _ band photometry over a 25 day period ( table 2 ) .",
    "the pairitel _ j _ , _ h _ and _ k@xmath8 _ fluxes are calibrated to the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogue ( skrutskie et al .",
    "the infrared light curves of sn  2008am over this phase appear to be flat and are probably heavily contaminated by the host . in the _ k@xmath8_-band , especially ,",
    "the detections are most probably indicative of the host rather than the sn .",
    "thus we refer to them only as upper limits throughout this work .",
    "although the infrared observations were obtained for only a small portion of the life of the sn , they can be used to better constrain the sed towards the infrared region for some phases .",
    "contribution by dust ir radiation to the observed _ j _ , _ h _ and _ k@xmath8 _ fluxes can not be ruled out , but we have made no allowance for that process .",
    "the palomar 60-inch ( p60 ) telescope obtained optical photometry in the bands g , r , i@xmath12 , and z@xmath12 for a period of @xmath7330 days in the rest frame .",
    "photometry on the p60 frames was performed using the aperture photometry routines in _",
    "iraf_. the aperture radius was set to be 20 pixels ( 7.57  arcsec ) , and the background level was measured in an annulus with 30 pixels ( 11.36  arcsec ) inner and 50 pixels ( 18.93  arcsec ) outer radii , centered on the source .",
    "the p60 data were calibrated via five local tertiary standard stars having sloan g@xmath12 , r@xmath12 , i@xmath12 and z@xmath12 magnitudes in the sdss catalogue ( table  3 ) .",
    "the applied p60 filters were @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( similar to the thuan - gunn filters ; thuan & gunn , 1976 ) , and i@xmath12 and z@xmath12 that resemble the sdss filters ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) , although systematic differences exist between the p60 filters and their standard counterparts ( cenko et al .",
    "2006 ) . due to",
    "the lack of standard fields observed simultaneously with the sn field , only approximate calibration of the p60 photometry was possible .",
    "as a first approximation , the sn magnitudes were tied to the g@xmath12 , r@xmath12 , i@xmath12 and z@xmath12 magnitudes of the local tertiary standards assuming only a zero - point shift and no color term .",
    "table 4 details the results of the p60 photometry of sn  2008am .",
    "the error caused by the neglect of the color term was investigated by comparing the observed differential magnitudes and colors of the local standards with their catalogued magnitudes .",
    "only the data from the @xmath27 filter are affected by the lack of the color term , systematically at a level of @xmath29 mag .",
    "no significant magnitude shifts were detected in any other filters .",
    "the resulting g@xmath12 , r@xmath12 , i@xmath12 , z@xmath12 ab - magnitudes of sn 2008am were then transformed to fluxes adopting the filter parameters and flux zero points of cenko et al . (",
    "the lack of the color term caused less than 1  @xmath30 error in the g@xmath12 fluxes , where @xmath30 is the random error of the photometry .",
    "the sn fluxes were subsequently corrected for host contamination and interstellar reddening .",
    "the host correction was done by removing the host fluxes obtained from sdss . for the interstellar reddening we used the interstellar absorption maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , giving @xmath31  0.025  mag and the milky way reddening law parametrized by fitzpatrick & massa ( 2007 ) adopting @xmath32  3.1 . throughout this work ,",
    "we use only the milky way reddening correction to obtain the final photometry for sn  2008am .",
    "the 50 to 180 day slope of the p60 g , r , i@xmath12 lightcurve is estimated to be 0.0065@xmath250.0006  mag  d@xmath2 .",
    "the z@xmath12 light curve is somewhat flatter over the same period .    _",
    "swift _ photometry was obtained by the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; roming et al .",
    "2005 ) covering the first @xmath7  80 rest - frame days after maximum .",
    "the conversions between swift magnitudes and fluxes were computed based on the calibration using the pickles stellar templates ( poole et al .",
    "2008 ) instead of the grb templates included in the swift caldb .",

    "the _ uvw1 _ , _",
    "uvm2 _ and _ uvw2 _ fluxes seem to level off .",
    "this may be due to the increasing contribution from the flux of the host galaxy relative to the decreasing sn flux at later epochs .",
    "the rest - frame light curves of sn  2008am for all the available photometric bands are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the top left panel shows the pairitel ir j and h light curves , the top right panel the _ swift _ uvot optical and uv light curves and the bottom panel the rotse unfiltered and p60 optical light curves .",
    "the data sets have been offset for clarity , with longer wavelength on top and shorter wavelength toward the bottom of each panel .",
    "the broad photometric wavelength coverage allows us to better constrain the sed of the sn .",
    "sn  2008am was observed with the vla at 8.46 ghz on 2008 feb 19.37 ut , approximately 30 rest frame days after optical maximum ( chandra & soderberg 2008 ) .",
    "no source was detected at the sn position above 120  @xmath33jy , which can be considered as a 3-@xmath30 upper limit .",
    "_ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows et al . 2005 ) images of sn  2008am were obtained for the six epochs in parallel with the uvot observations .",
    "no x - ray source was detected at the position of the sn , after coadding all xrt observations .",
    "assuming a power - law spectrum with spectral index of @xmath34 , the x - ray flux upper limit was estimated to be @xmath35  erg  @xmath36  s@xmath2 ( or , equivalently @xmath37  erg  s@xmath2 ) at @xmath7  50 rest frame days since explosion .",
    "the availability of multi - band simultaneous photometry for some epochs helps us construct seds for sn  2008am and thus study the evolution and basic properties of the event .",
    "our criteria for selecting the photometric epochs for which we constructed the seds were two : close sampling in time and maximum possible wavelength coverage .",
    "those criteria led to the choice of 10 epochs for which we constructed the photometric seds . for four of those epochs we had available uv+optical+ir observations ( hereafter uvoir ) , for four only optical ( p60 data ; hereafter opt ) and for two ( 08 - 01 - 30 and 08 - 02 - 25 ) optical+ir ( see figure 4 ) .    for the 08 - 02 - 25 epoch we interpolated between the previous ( 08 - 02 - 16 ) and the next ( 08 - 03 - 14 ) epoch for which we had uv data .",
    "the error of this interpolated value was estimated using error propagation analysis for a linear fit .",
    "we note that the uv flux for the interpolated 08 - 02 - 25 epoch is uncertain since the uv light curve decline of emission line objects like sn  2008am is not well constrained at later times . adding the interpolated uv data to the optical+ir data gave us a total of 5 epochs of uvoir data and 1 epoch ( 08 - 01 - 30 ) for oir data that we will later use to estimate the pseudo - bolometric light curve ( lc ) of the event .",
    "although we see no sign of classic supernova photospheric p cygni lines ( see  2.4 and  3 ) , the blue continua of the spectra are consistent with thermal emission .",
    "this emission could arise in shocked csm that is modestly optically - thick ( @xmath38  1 ) to absorption . to produce a quantitative diagnostic",
    ", we fit single temperature black - body curves to the set of the five uvoir and one oir photometric seds in order to determine effective black - body temperatures in the rest frame .",
    "we included the reddening corrections discussed in  2.2 .",
    "the black - body curve fits were done in the rest - frame of the sn .",
    "bolometric luminosities were then derived from the integral of the flux from the corresponding black body at the adopted distance of the supernova .",
    "effective black - body radii were derived from the luminosity and black - body temperature .",
    "we did not attempt to fit the opt epochs with single temperature black - body curves as the uncertainties of the fit would be large , given the lack of uv data .",
    "we estimated lower limits for the bolometric luminosity in these four epochs by integrating the observed sed .",
    "figure 5 shows the photometric seds of sn  2008am for the six selected epochs together with the best - fit ( lowest @xmath39 ) black - body curve in each case .",
    "figure 6 shows two examples of uvoir seds and their black - body curve fits and nearly contemporaneous spectral continua at + 22d and + 33d after maximum , respectively .",
    "black - body fits to the spectroscopic data were also done in the rest frame and included the reddening corrections of  2.2 .",
    "the spectra of sn  2008am were scaled to the simultaneous photometry in each case , before any reddening corrections were applied .",
    "the temperatures derived from the spectral fits agree with those derived from the fits to the seds within the errors at these two epochs ( figure 6 ) .",
    "table 6 summarizes the characteristics of the black - body fits to the uvoir and oir seds of sn  2008am , the effective black - body temperature , @xmath40 , the effective black - body radius , @xmath41 , and the derived bolometric luminosity , @xmath42 .",
    "figure 7 presents the evolution of @xmath40 ( upper panel ) , @xmath41 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath42 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the filled triangles correspond to the fits to the uvoir and oir seds and the open circles to those of four early het and keck spectra ( the fifth , obtained on 2008 jan 30.3 has a slightly anomalous slope that we attribute to observing conditions ;  2.4 ) .",
    "the single temperature black - body fits to the seds of sn  2008am show considerable uncertainty and scatter .",
    "the photometric points scatter around the best - fit black - body curves and around the spectral continua .",
    "differences between the spectral and photometric results at similar epochs may be attributed to the fact that the optical spectra do not accurately constrain the maximum of the black - body curve and that we assumed a single black - body to fit the seds and not more complex models . at the latest epochs",
    "there could be other effects ( for example , dust formation ) that affect the final estimates .",
    "the nir data are always in excess with respect to the fitted curves .",
    "that may be an indication that the single - temperature black - body models do not accurately represent the emission properties of sn  2008am , but it is also possible that the nir data are still somewhat contaminated by the host galaxy and only represent upper limits to the corresponding supernova flux .",
    "another possibility is that the nir excess is a sign of early warm dust emission ( meikle et al .",
    "2007 ; mattila et al . 2008 ; kotak et al . 2009 ; fox et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the ir data are thus especially uncertain , but these data have relatively little weight in the black - body fits .",
    "the black - body temperatures and radii derived here are only indicative of the general conditions and their trends , and not to be treated as quantitatively precise , nor as evidence that the emission is truly black body .",
    "the effective black - body temperatures are in the range of 10,000 - 12,000 k , as presented in table 6 and figure 7 , and are constant in time within the scatter .",
    "the pseudo - bolometric light curve implies a total radiated energy of about 10@xmath43  ergs .",
    "other estimates of the total radiated energy will be given in  4 based on several physical models .",
    "we will argue in  4.4 that the energy powering sn  2008am is most probably the interaction between the ejecta and the csm and thus the estimates of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 do not correspond to an expanding photosphere coincident with the ejecta of the sn .",
    "the ejecta of the sn and the csm shocks may be hidden behind an optically - thick csm . in this case",
    "the values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 refer to conditions in an optically - thick csm with @xmath38  1 representing the effective photosphere of the csm .",
    "we acquired a total of seven spectra of sn  2008am and its host galaxy spanning @xmath7  2 years after discovery .",
    "four of them were taken with the het low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; hill et al .",
    "1998 ) on 2008 jan 29.3 ut , 2008 jan 30.3 , 2008 feb . 18.3 and 2008",
    "25.3 , corresponding to + 11 , + 12 , + 27 and + 33 rest - frame days after maximum , respectively .",
    "two other spectra were obtained with the keck - i low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on 2008 feb . 12.0 ut ( + 22 days after maximum in rest - frame ) and 2009 mar .",
    "31.0 ( + 352 rest - frame days after maximum ) .",
    "another keck - lris spectrum of the host galaxy was taken on 2010 jan .",
    "09.0 ut , + 554 rest - frame days after maximum , when the transient had faded below the detection limit . all spectra were reduced in the standard way using _ iraf_. the instrumental resolution was @xmath717   for the het spectra and @xmath76   for the keck spectra .",
    "we will refer to the spectra obtained within a month after maximum as  early - phase \" and the + 352d keck - spectrum as  late - phase , \" respectively .",
    "all spectra were corrected for milky way reddening ( as described in  2.2 ) and scaled to contemporaneous photometric data .",
    "the epochs of the early spectroscopic observations relative to the light curve are shown in figure 3 .",
    "figure 8 shows the spectral evolution of sn  2008am .",
    "note that the first het spectrum ( obtained on 2008 jan 29.3 ) is plotted for completeness , but omitted from further analysis because of the availability of the second spectrum ( taken one day later , on jan 30.3 ) that was obtained during better observing conditions giving better s / n ratio .",
    "the jan 30.3 spectrum has a somewhat discrepant slope for reasons we have been unable to resolve , but the continuum slope of the spectra does not enter into our analysis except for perhaps a very small effect on line profiles . the 2008 jan 29.3",
    "spectrum was used in the black - body fits (  2.3 ; figure 7 ) .",
    "the spectra were deredshifted by @xmath0  0.2338 determined from the narrow emission features in the host spectrum .",
    "this value is very close to the one derived by yuan et al .",
    "( 2008a ) based on the early - phase het spectra .",
    "the early - phase spectra show prominent features of h ( h@xmath44 , h@xmath45 and h@xmath46 ) .",
    "the he  i 5876   line is detected in the feb 12 keck spectrum and with a smaller s / n ratio in the feb 25 het spectrum .",
    "na d may also contribute to this feature , but we were unable to make a definite identification .",
    "the het data had inferior seeing and lower spatial resolution of the spectrograph that made it impossible to fully resolve and separate the sn and the host .",
    "given those instrumental differences between het - lrs and keck - lris we chose to analyze the spectra uncorrected for host extinction so that we could treat all the data in a uniform way .",
    "the host probably contributes to some of the detected emission lines ; [ oii ] 3727   and [ oiii ] 5007   are undoubtedly present , and [ oiii ] 4959   can also be weakly detected in all het spectra .",
    "fortunately , the host contribution to the continuum should be much less , because the + 554d keck spectrum , which is attributed to the host galaxy , shows mainly a flat , low continuum .",
    "due to better resolution and seeing , the host subtraction was possible for the early - phase and late - phase keck spectra .",
    "the small visible spatial extension of the galaxy required a background region defined as close to the sn as possible to achieve good background subtraction .",
    "most of the galactic forbidden emission lines have been removed successfully ; however , this process resulted in a slight oversubtraction in the core of h@xmath44 for the early - phase keck spectrum , forming an  absorption \" dip on top of the line .",
    "that feature is due to the reduction process and should not be interpreted physically ( see below ) .",
    "although we show the host - subtracted early keck spectrum for comparison , we note again that we do not use it for our analysis since host subtraction can not be performed for the het spectra given the different spatial resolution .",
    "the late - phase keck spectrum is also dominated by a broadened h@xmath44 line , but all other sn features have already faded below detectability .",
    "the shape of h@xmath44 strongly suggests that the transient was still visible at + 352 days after maximum .",
    "a few narrow features at h@xmath45 and around @xmath75000    also appear that are probably due to contribution from the host .",
    "the host spectrum , obtained with keck - lris at + 554 rest - frame days after maximum ( figure 9 ) , shows the usual narrow emission features of galaxies with ongoing star - formation . beside balmer lines",
    ", we identified [ oii ] 3727  ,   [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007  ,   [ nii ] 6548 , 6583   and he i 5876  .",
    "there are also indications for the [ sii ] 6716 , 6731   features , but that region is heavily contaminated by tellurics , preventing a definite identification .",
    "all lines as well as the shape of the continuum ( figure 9 ;  2.1 ) can be very well matched by an sb1 galaxy template ( kinney et al .",

    "the h@xmath44 line is presumed to be excited by photoionization and to be intrinsically narrow , but broadened by multiple scattering on hot , free electrons ( fransson & chevalier 1989 ; chugai , 2001 ) . in the second phase ,",
    "90 - 150 days after explosion ( 20 - 80 days after maximum light ) , the h@xmath44 line in sn  2006gy broadened somewhat , and developed a distinct , narrow p cygni component with a velocity of @xmath7200  km  s@xmath2 and strong absorption in the blue wing extending to @xmath7 4000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the red wing is nearly constant during this phase and indicates a line of intermediate width of @xmath7 1800 km s@xmath2 .",
    "smith et al .",
    "attribute this phase to a condition where the photosphere has receded to beneath the forward shock so that radiation from the shocked matter can escape freely .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) proposed that the width of the red wing is determined by the doppler shift of the expanding cold , dense shell ( cds ) that is presumed to form between the forward and reverse shocks in the collision of the sn ejecta with the dense csm ( chugai 2001 ) .",
    "the third phase in sn  2006gy is the very late phase , 150 - 240 days after explosion , when the h@xmath44 line becomes narrower .",
    "this is the phase when the csm interaction is expected to decline in strength and the line - emitting region to become optically thin .",
    "sn  2008am and sn  2006gy had different rise times in their light curves , but their spectral evolutions show similarities if account is taken for the different timescales .",
    "we first examine the possibility that the intermediate - width lines in the early phase of sn  2008am obtain their wings from multiple electron scattering , a mechanism favored by smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for sn  2006gy .",
    "our first four spectra of sn  2008am were obtained when the sn was within a factor of 2 of maximum light , in keeping with phase 1 of sn  2006gy by smith et al . our spectra can be fit well with a single lorentzian profile ( see below ) consistent with multiple electron scattering , and they show no sign of broad features nor p cygni lines of any width , similar to phase 1 . for these reasons , we believe a plausible case can be made that , despite the different timescales , sn  2008am could be a close cousin to sn  2006gy , and that our early - phase spectra are formed in the phase when the photosphere was in a dense csm shell , but beyond the forward shock . if this is the case , sn  2008am could very well have then proceeded to phase 2 defined by smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , but we simply failed to obtain any spectra in this phase , more than 2 magnitudes below maximum light . at very late phases , the two objects displayed substantially narrower h@xmath44 profiles and are again quite similar .",
    "further support for this model may come from the fact that in the early phase both h@xmath44 and h@xmath45 showed peaks redshifted by @xmath62 km s@xmath2 from their rest - frame wavelength .",
    "the same effect was observed for sn  2006gy by smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and it is also predicted by the electron scattering model of chugai ( 2001 ) .",
    "chugai ( 2001 ) assumed a velocity profile in which the velocity decreased with radius as might be caused by radiative acceleration .",
    "fransson & chevalier ( 1989 ) assumed an homologous velocity profile in their multiple scattering models and found profiles with enhanced red wings and a small blue shift of the peak .",
    "the details of the line profiles might thus contain information on the velocity profiles in the scattering regions of sn  2008am and related events , but we have not explored this in any depth .",
    "the second possibility is that the intermediate - width lines arise from the post - shock motion of the shocked csm in a cds when the photosphere is interior to the forward shock ( fransson 1984 ; chugai et al .",
    "2004 ; dessart et al .",
    "this would correspond to our early spectra being already in the phase 2 of smith et al .",
    "the principal argument against this interpretation is that we do not see any of the narrow or broad absorption manifested by sn  2006gy when it was in this phase , as interpreted by smith et al .",
    "it could be that the structure of the csm around sn  2008am is such that the matter interior to and beyond the shock is not sufficiently optically thick to create appreciable absorption .",
    "another possibility is that these absorption features might have been observed had we had better s / n ratio and/or better spectral resolution .",
    "we thus can not rule out this possibility , but find it somewhat less likely than the broadening by multiple electron scattering .",
    "another mechanism that has been proposed to account for intermediate - width lines is the inward propagation of shocks into dense clumps of matter that have been engulfed by the sn shock ( chugai & danziger , 1994 ) , rather than a single post - shock shell . in this picture , the sn shock sweeps past clumps in the progenitor wind , but the resulting high pressure of the shocked low - density csm drives a shock into the dense clumps .",
    "this may broaden the lines via doppler - motion , and for appropriate choices of cloud sizes , densities and other parameters one can produce h@xmath44 lines of suitable width and intensity .",
    "the problem with this model in the current context is that it is designed to have dense clumps separated by less dense , optically - thin material .",
    "the latter should allow the sn ejecta to be observed directly .",
    "since we see no sign of high - velocity sn features , we find the configuration with the enveloping cds , as attributed to sn  2006gy by smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , to be preferable to the clumpy model , where the dense clumps have a rather small filling factor .      in the context of the csm interaction picture",
    ", we considered three different models to account for the line profiles of the early - phase spectra of sn  2008am : @xmath63 thermal doppler - broadening producing gaussian line shapes , @xmath64 single thompson scattering on free electrons giving exponential profiles ( laor 2006 ) and @xmath65 multiple scattering on hot free electrons resulting in lorentzian profiles ( chugai , 2001 ; smith et al .",
    "the first phenomenon is common in stellar atmospheres .",
    "the second one is proposed for the broad - line region in agns / qsos .",
    "the third one might pertain to the dense csm environment around type iin sne .",
    "we fitted gaussian , lorentzian and exponential profiles to the observed features .",
    "the results are listed in table 8 and plotted in figure 12 .",
    "the gaussian fits were inferior compared to the other two models in terms of conforming to profile shapes .",

    "if interpreted as a simple thermal doppler - broadening , the corresponding temperature would be @xmath66 k , which is obviously too high .",
    "on the other hand , if the line width is attributed to bulk kinematic motion , these velocities are too low to be directly related to the expected velocities of sn ejecta .",
    "the exponential fits are motivated by the possibility that the line - forming region might be a photoionized , but less dense , optically - thin medium , similar to the environment of agns . in this case , the observed line profiles are due to thompson scattering on hot free electrons . if the medium is less dense , hence optically thin to electron scattering , single scattering is an adequate description .",
    "laor ( 2006 ) investigated such a region and derived the emergent line shape to be @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the doppler - shift from the line center and @xmath30 is the velocity .",
    "the electron - scattering optical depth can be expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the velocity dispersion of free electrons .",
    "the fits to the observed line profiles resulted in @xmath30 = 800 @xmath25 100 km s@xmath2 , which gives @xmath71 @xmath7 0.03 if the electron temperature @xmath72 is assumed to be 11,000 k , close to the continuum effective temperature of sn  2008am .",
    "the resulting optical depth is much below unity , verifying the general assumption of this model ; however , it should be noted that higher optical depths produce narrower lines in this model .",
    "since we observe intermediate - width lines earlier and a narrower line later , the prediction from the laor model would be the strong increase of electron optical depth , the opposite of what is expected in an expanding , diluting sn environment .",
    "the fitting of lorentzians produced the best fit to all line profiles .",
    "the resulting fwhms are @xmath7 1000 @xmath25 300 km s@xmath2 for h@xmath44 and @xmath7 1700 @xmath25 500 km s@xmath2 for h@xmath45",
    ". the narrower h@xmath44 profile may be the consequence of host contribution to the het spectra , which is certainly stronger in h@xmath44 .",
    "indeed , the fwhm of the host - subtracted early - phase keck h@xmath44 profile is much closer to the average fwhm of the h@xmath45 line .",
    "since the line - forming medium is assumed to be optically thick in this model , the line widths from the lorentzian fitting can not be simply related to the physical conditions characterizing the whole line - forming region",
    ". a higher density of free electrons should produce wider profiles and prevent the direct escape of the original narrow - width line . as a consequence , as the line - forming medium expands , the line broadening should decrease .",
    "if multiple scattering is the correct interpretation , then the width of the lines we measure in the early - phase spectra of sn  2008am can not be attributed to bulk kinematic motion .",
    "the width of the lines gives an upper limit on the motion of the line - forming region , but yields no constraint on the velocity of deeper , optically - thick regions .",
    "the profiles may give information on the velocity distribution in the scattering region since the velocity profile can affect the resulting scattering - line profile if the bulk velocity exceeds the electron thermal velocity ( fransson & chevalier 1989 ; chugai 2001 ) .",
    "for multiple scattering , the line wings are primarily a measure of the electron scattering optical depth of the line - emitting region . following smith et al .",

    "this type of model does not account for the observed rise of the light curve .",
    "smith & mccray ( 2007 ) adopted a l@xmath115 rise for their model of sn  2006gy based on the early portion of the diffusion models of arnett ( 1982 ) .",
    "they did not self - consistently consider the input necessary to drive such a rise .",
    "they found the diffusion time on the decline to be about the observed rise time for sn  2006gy , but we consider that a coincidence , since such a model fails to account for sn  2008am , as we show below .",
    "in order to account for the rising part of the light curve of sn  2008am , we consider a forward shock that propagates through the csm envelope and deposits energy for a time @xmath116 and then shuts off .",
    "the effect of the reverse shock will be considered below .",
    "this model is somewhat similar to the ",
    "top hat \" magnetar - input model that is considered in kasen & bildsten ( 2010 ) with the exception that we solve for the general case of large initial radius .",
    "the luminosity deposition function in our model has the form @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 otherwise , where @xmath120 is the total kinetic energy deposited by the shock in the csm shell .",
    "this model formally assumes that the luminosity @xmath121 is deposited in the center of homologously expanding matter .",
    "while not totally self - consistent , this model captures the essence of the shell - shock model on both the rise and decline . using this energy deposition function and the first law of thermodynamics coupled with the diffusion approximation ( as was originally done by arnett 1980 , but for a radioactive decay input ) , it can be shown that the light curve is given by the following expression : @xmath122 , & $ t < t_{sh}$ , \\cr \\frac{e_{sh}}{t_{sh } } e^{-(t^{2}/2t_{d}^2+r_{0}t / v t_{d}^{2 } ) } [ e^{(t_{sh}^{2}/2t_{d}^2+r_{0}t_{sh}/v t_{d}^{2})}-1 ] , & $ t > t_{sh}$,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the diffusion time - scale , @xmath98 is the characteristic bulk velocity of the csm shell , and @xmath124 is the initial radius of the optically - thick csm shell around sn  2008am .",
    "we note that in the case where @xmath124 is small , the result for small initial radius is recovered ( kasen & bildsten 2010 ) .    to evaluate this model , the second part of equation 3 ( @xmath125 ) is fitted to the rotse light curve decline of sn  2008am in order to determine @xmath120 , @xmath124 and @xmath123 .",
    "then using the best - fitting parameters , we plot the expected rise to maximum for the event within this class of model .",
    "we first consider the case for which the diffusion time on the decline is forced to be equal to the input time , which is also the rise time to maximum ( @xmath126  34d ) .",
    "the best fit to the data in this case , is obtained for @xmath127  ergs and @xmath128  cm if @xmath124 is constrained to be larger than the smallest possible progenitor radius ( @xmath129  cm for wolf - rayet stars ) .",

    "the larger mass derived for sn  2006gy is mainly determined by the larger rise time of 70d versus 34d for sn  2008am and by the larger velocity of 4,000  km  s@xmath2 versus the fiducial 1,000  km  s@xmath2 that we have adopted for sn  2008am .",
    "an estimate of the optical depth of the csm shell under the assumption that the derived shell radius is significantly larger than the radius of the progenitor and for constant density profile is given by : @xmath142 assuming that electron scattering in a hydrogen plasma is the main source of opacity ( @xmath106  0.4  @xmath107 ) , @xmath135  1,000  km  s@xmath2 ( and taking for the csm shell the derived parameters @xmath134  1.0  @xmath103 and @xmath143  cm ) an estimate for the optical depth of the shell around sn  2008am at maximum light is @xmath144  1,390 while for sn  2006tf it is @xmath144  480 ( smith et al . 2008 ) and for sn  2006gy it is @xmath144  330 ( smith et al .",

    "chevalier ( 1982 ) and chevalier & fransson ( 2003 ) predict that the bulk of the luminosity from optically thin forward shock emission is in the uv and x - ray region of the spectrum .",
    "it seems unlikely that the optically - thin case would reproduce the spectra and spectral evolution of sn  2008am .",
    "in addition , this model being optically thin , it is incompatible with the failure to see sn photospheric features .",
    "we conclude that an optically - thin ejecta - csm interaction model alone does not provide a satisfactory explanation for sn  2008am .",
    "next , we discuss a hybrid model in which the csm comprises both an optically - thick and an optically - thin region .",

    "the lightcurve is described by the sum of equation 3 and equation 7 .",
    "we assume the whole structure follows a single power - law density profile @xmath192 so that the optical depth at a given point is : @xmath193 we take the point @xmath194  1 at radius @xmath195 to represent the boundary between the optically - thick and optically thin regions . in this case",
    ", @xmath124 corresponds to the inner initial radius of the optically - thick part of the csm shell , which is also the radius of the progenitor star , where the density is @xmath188 .",

    "the best fit ( plotted in the middle panel of figure 14 ) is the same as that obtained in the purely optically thick shell case indicating that any contribution from optically thin emission is negligible .",
    "therefore , for a hybrid model , the optically - thick component ( equation 3 ) dominates all phases of the observed rotse light curve of sn  2008am .",
    "kasen & bildsten ( 2010 ) and woosley ( 2010 ) proposed the idea that the light curves of some slsne may be powered by the spin - down of young magnetars .",
    "in such a model , the energy input by the magnetar is given by the dipole spin - down formula : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the initial magnetar rotational energy , @xmath201 is the characteristic time scale for spin - down that depends on the strength of the magnetic field and @xmath202  2 for a magnetic dipole .",
    "for a fiducial moment of inertia , the initial period of the magnetar in units of 10  ms is given by @xmath203erg  s@xmath2 /@xmath204 .",

    "the single - temperature black - body fits for sn  2008am were imperfect , implying that the underlying emission mechanism is more complex in nature .",

    "the overall observed spectral evolution of sn  2008am is similar to that of sn  2006gy at similar phases , and we conclude that they are closely related .",
    "we considered a variety of models for the emission line profiles : gaussian as might typify thermal doppler broadening , an exponential profile that might characterize single electron scattering in an optically - thin medium , and lorentzian that might represent models of multiple electron scattering ( chugai 2001 ; smith et al .",
    "we find that the latter provides the best fit to the overall line shape .",
    "an important implication is that the line broadening is probably dominated by electron scattering in our spectra and that the line width contains little or no information about the bulk kinetic expansion velocity of the matter in the circumstellar medium or the underlying supernova .",
    "an upper limit to the velocity in the line - forming region is about 1,000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "chugai made specific assumptions in his models , for instance that the velocity profile decreased outward as might result from radiative acceleration , that might not apply in general .",

    "equal fails drastically for sn  2008am , primarily because of the rapid rise , 34 d in the rest frame .",
    "we conclude that the success of a model with a single diffusion time for sn  2006gy was a coincidence and not a general property of this class of events .",
    "we could generate a reasonable fit in the context of this model by including an input power source representing the collision of the supernova with an optically - thick shell that was a",
    " top hat \" function of constant luminosity during the rise that shut off at 34 days , the point of maximum light in this model .",
    "in this model , the timescale of the power source dictated the rise time and a separately determined diffusion time of 120d governed the decline .",
    "this model rose with @xmath223 at very early times ( as assumed for the full rise of sn  2006gy by smith & mccray ) and was overall concave upward in contrast to the observed light curve that appears to be concave downward .",

    "the high - velocity absorption is presumably related to the sn ejecta , and the low - velocity absorption to the motion of the csm that has not yet been hit by the shock , but is subject to radiative excitation and recombination .",
    "the most likely explanation of our failure to detect these p cygni features is absence of data at the appropriate phase .",
    "the narrower h@xmath44 line in both events nearly a year after explosion is consistent with the emitting matter becoming more dilute with less broadening by multiple electron scattering .",
    "other slsne seem to fall broadly in the category of sn  2006gy and sn  2008am .",
    "sn  2006tf shows nearly symmetric emission lines , especially of h@xmath44 , up to 40 days after discovery ( there is no data on the rise so the explosion date and date of maximum are uncertain ) , with the development of narrow p cygni features by 66 days after discovery ( smith et al .",
    "2008 ) . at these",
    "later epochs , there are indications in both the emission and absorption for rapidly moving material , @xmath229 km s@xmath2 , presumably from the underlying sn ejecta .",
    "sn  2006tf is somewhat different from sn  2006gy and sn  2008am in the late phases , a year after explosion , where the h@xmath44 line seems to be formed by collisional rather than radiative excitation ( smith et al .",
    "the h@xmath44 line in sn  2006tf at this stage shows a prominent blue  plateau \" extending to about 1,000  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "sn  2008iy was an unusual sn iin with the unprecedented slow rise time of 400 days ( miller et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the post - maximum spectra of sn  2008iy are somewhat similar to those of sn  2008am , with strong intermediate - width h and he emission lines .",
    "a single temperature black body failed to provide a good fit to the seds of sn  2008iy , as we found for the sed of sn  2008am (  2.3 ) .",
    "miller et al . identified three distinct components in the late - time h@xmath44 profile of sn  2008iy : broad ( @xmath7  4,500  km  s@xmath2 ) , intermediate ( @xmath7  1,650  km  s@xmath2 ) and narrow ( @xmath7  75  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "miller et al . proposed a model of interaction of the sn ejecta with a clumpy circumstellar medium similar to that for sn  1988z presented by chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) .",
    "miller et al . argued that the rise in the light curve resulted from an increase in the number of clumps with radius .",
    "given the success of the shell - shock models of sn  2006gy and sn  2008am , it would be of interest to apply such a model to sn  2008iy .    as for sn  2006gy and sn  2006tf",
    ", the suggestion of a relatively massive shell around sn  2008am and the estimated mass loss rates ( @xmath7  0.1 - 10  @xmath103  yr@xmath2 ) imply that the progenitor star must have undergone substantial mass - loss in the years prior to the explosion .",
    "episodic mass loss can occur around very massive lbv stars , similar to @xmath230 carinae .",
    "the reason for lbv mass - loss is not currently fully understood ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "massive shell ejection can also be the product of pulsational pair - instability ( rakavy & shaviv 1967 ; barkat , rakavy & sack 1967 ) .",
    "models suggest that repetitive shell ejection takes place for progenitor main sequence masses in the range 95 - 130  @xmath103 ( woosley , blinnikov & heger 2007 ) .",
    "supernova - like luminosity can be produced either during the ejection of each of these shells individually ( kasen et al . 2008 ) , or during the collisions between shells ejected at different times ( woosley , blinnikov & heger 2007 ) .",
    "although there is some sign of high - velocity material in some of the slsne that otherwise resemble sn  2008am , the nature of the presumed underlying supernova in these type iin slsne remains obscure .",
    "as noted in the introduction , other slsne show little or no evidence for hydrogen or interaction with a csm . in the case of sn  2007bi , this is an important part of the argument that it is a pair - instability supernova ( gal - yam et al . 2009 ) .",
    "an important goal in the study of slsne remains the determination of the density distribution in the csm that will give important clues to the mass - loss history .",
