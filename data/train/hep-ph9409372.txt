    "the solar neutrino deficit , confirmed by all existing experiments , challenges our understanding of the sun as well as of neutrinos .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider the possibility of model independent determinations of the principle neutrino flux components from the solar neutrino data , both at present and in the future and with and without new neutrino properties .",
    "these fluxes can then be compared with the prediction of any solar model , standard or nonstandard .",
    "in fact , if the present experiments @xcite are correct , purely astrophysical explanations for the flux deficit are highly unlikely :    * the standard solar models ( ssms ) @xcite are excluded by the data as summarized in table  [ tab : expdata ]",
    ". the discrepancy can not be reconciled by simply changing input parameters in the ssm calculations @xcite .",
    "* the lower observed rate of homestake relative to kamiokande is incompatible with astrophysical solutions in general .",
    "this is a much more serious difficulty than the simple deficit of observed neutrinos relative to the ssm expectations.b flux is reduced ( e.g. , by lowering the core temperature or reducing the @xmath4 cross section ) to explain the kamiokande data . ]",
    "a model independent analysis @xcite suggests a complete elimination of the @xmath0be flux and , in addition , a larger depletion of the @xmath1b spectrum at lower energies and/or additional neutral current events from @xmath5 or @xmath6 in kamiokande . the larger suppression of the @xmath0be than the @xmath1b flux contradicts nonstandard solar models in general , including ad hoc ones .",
    "a distortion of the @xmath1b energy spectrum can not be caused by astrophysical effects at the observable level @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 can interact through the neutral currents in electron scattering in kamiokande , and their existence in the solar flux signifies neutrino flavor oscillations . *",
    "the problem of the larger suppression of the @xmath0be flux relative to @xmath1b remains even if we ignore any one of the three data . in this sense , the data are consistent with each other .",
    "in particular , if we consider the kamiokande and the gallium results only , the nonstandard solar models consistent with the kamiokande result generally predict a gallium rate larger than 100 snu , atoms /sec . ]",
    "inconsistent with the combined result of sage and gallex ( @xmath7 snu ) .    with standard neutrino physics ,",
    "the current situation forces us to consider a serious problem with two or more of the experiments _ and _ a drastic revision of the ssm calculation unless all of the experiments are wrong .",
    "the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism @xcite , on the other hand , provides a complete description of the data and is also consistent with the ssm ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "because of the consistency with the experiments and the simplicity of the theory , we consider the two - flavor msw solutions as the most attractive scenario among many proposed particle physics solutions .    for solar astronomy ,",
    "whether new neutrino physics is present or not , the central issue is the determination of the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "the theory of the sun , which is the best measured main sequence star , is the keystone of our understanding of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "solar neutrinos are a direct , sensitive probe of the solar core , and the neutrino flux measurements provide an opportunity for rigorous tests of solar models , standard or nonstandard .    for the ssm ,",
    "the neutrino spectrum is a diagnostic of the underlying assumptions in the theory .",
    "the flux prediction depends on the input physics , such as the opacity calculation and the nuclear cross sections , whose uncertainties might be underestimated . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath8 cross section , which is directly proportional to the @xmath1b flux , was recently measured using the coulomb dissociation method in the riken experiment @xcite .",
    "although the measurement uncertainty is still large , the preliminary result suggests the cross section can be 25% lower than the current standard value @xcite .",
    "the ssm also includes simplifications such as the omission of rotations , magnetic fields , and the gravitational settling of various elements . those effects on the neutrino flux",
    "have never been quantified in the ssm uncertainties .",
    "the nonstandard solar models , most of which are constructed to explain the solar neutrino deficit , assume nonstandard input parameters or nonstandard mechanisms .",
    "examples are the low central temperature ( @xmath9 ) , low opacity , low z , large @xmath10 , , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the s factors proportional to the cross sections for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "] large @xmath11 , small @xmath12 , small @xmath13 , mixing , and weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) models .",
    "the neutrino data should test the validity of such ( often ad hoc ) assumptions .    to determine the solar neutrino spectrum from the experiments , one needs to extract from the data the magnitude of the flux , component by component .",
    "the kamiokande experiment measures the @xmath1b flux exclusively .",
    "the radio - chemical detectors measure the flux components only as a weighted sum according to the energy dependence of the detector cross sections : the homestake chlorine experiment is sensitive mainly to the @xmath1b flux , but also to the @xmath0be , cno , and @xmath18 fluxes ; the gallium experiments measure all components , including the dominant @xmath2 flux . in the future ,",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite and icarus @xcite will measure the @xmath1b flux with a high precision .",
    "borexino @xcite will be capable of measuring the @xmath0be line spectrum .",
    "hellaz @xcite , and heron @xcite will observe the @xmath0be flux and the main @xmath2 flux individually .",
    "this solar neutrino spectroscopy can be complicated if new particle physics effects are present , since those effects are often energy dependent and therefore distort the energy spectrum .",
    "uncertainties in the neutrino parameters contribute to uncertainties in the neutrino flux , and vice versa . in the presence of the msw effect ,",
    "for example , the determination of the initial ( undistorted ) flux components requires a knowledge of the neutrino parameters and , in turn , the determination of the neutrino parameters depends on the initial flux magnitudes .    to extricate the neutrino flux components from the data and distinguish various competing solar models , it is best to consider a simple and general theoretical framework including all standard and nonstandard solar models .",
    "such an analysis scheme should be viable with and without particle physics effects .",
    "variations of solar models have usually been considered in model dependent frameworks .",
    "monte carlo ssms @xcite were obtained from various input parameters normally distributed about their most probable values .",
    "those solar models are , however , calculated within the ssm and do not address the possibility of nonstandard processes omitted in the modeling or the possibility of input parameters grossly different from the standard values . the low @xmath9 model @xcite parameterizes the neutrino fluxes by nonstandard core temperatures as power laws @xcite .",
    "the description is more general than the monte carlo ssms since it includes a large class of nonstandard solar models .",
    "again , however , the @xmath9 description is model dependent : there are nonstandard solar models that can not be parametrized simply by nonstandard @xmath9 , such as those with nonstandard @xmath13 or @xmath12 values .",
    "in this paper , we consider a model independent description of solar models , characterized by the magnitude of each of the neutrino flux components . by setting up an analysis scheme as general as possible ,",
    "we depart from particular theoretical constraints .",
    "we hope that the experiments will distinguish standard and nonstandard models and eventually identify the correct solar model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that such a description is feasible and is a powerful tool in analyzing the solar neutrino data , especially once the high precision data from the next generation experiments are available .",
    "our model independent analysis originates in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we elaborate the analysis and extend it to the case in which the two - flavor msw effect is present .",
    "( of course , the analysis can be generalized in the presence of any particle physics effect . )",
    "we consider magnitudes of the four prominent flux components , @xmath2 , @xmath0be , @xmath1b , and cno ( the sum of @xmath19n and @xmath20o ) , as free parameters in fitting data . in doing so",
    ", we make minimal assumptions :    * the sun is in a quasi - static state , and the solar luminosity is generated by the ordinary nuclear reactions of the @xmath2 and cno chains .",
    "this imposes a relation among the fluxes : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sum of the @xmath19n and @xmath20o fluxes , which are varied with the same scale factor .",
    "* astrophysical mechanisms do not distort the shape of the energy spectrum of the individual flux component at the observable level .",
    "it was shown that possible distortions of the spectrum due to such astrophysical effects as gravitational red - shifts and thermal fluctuations are completely negligible @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , particle physics effects such as the msw mechanism are in general energy dependent and lead to significant spectral distortions . * the detector cross section calculations @xcite are correct . * the minor fluxes ( @xmath18 , neutrinos are from the reaction @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath18 flux is the largest among the three minor fluxes .",
    "it is strongly correlated with the @xmath2 flux in many of the nonstandard solar models @xcite and does not vary significantly from model to model .",
    "of course , one can also use the @xmath18 flux as a free parameter . ]",
    "@xmath24f , and @xmath25 neutrinos are from the reaction @xmath26 . ] ) are set to the ssm values .",
    "the simultaneous ( global ) analysis of all data is essential in obtaining constraints on fluxes .",
    "no one experiment provides enough information to determine the entire neutrino spectrum ; only by combining various experiments with different energy thresholds is it possible to determine each flux component and test solar model predictions .",
    "for example , if there are no new particle physics effects , then by combining the @xmath1b flux measured in kamiokande with the homestake and gallium experiments , one can deduce an absence of the @xmath0be flux and a detection of the @xmath2 flux .",
    "allowing for msw or other particle physics effects , a global analysis is even more essential because one must simultaneously determine the initial fluxes and the msw - induced flux reduction and spectral distortions .    in constraining the fluxes and testing solar models ,",
    "a consistent joint analysis is important .",
    "taking overlaps of parameter space allowed by different experiments does not yield a correct estimation of uncertainties @xcite ; one needs to carry out proper joint @xmath27 analyses , which are essentially identical to the maximum likelihood method in gaussian cases .",
    "since we are testing theoretical models statistically , the experimental and theoretical uncertainties have to be incorporated ; a proper treatment of the correlations among uncertainties is also important @xcite .    when the msw effect is present , it is best to incorporate available energy spectrum and day - night asymmetry data to obtain additional constraints on the neutrino parameters and therefore on the fluxes",
    ". those constraints from future high - counting experiments would be especially useful .",
    "in this paper , however , we do not incorporate the existing energy spectrum and day - night data from kamiokande @xcite ; their uncertainties are large and do not significantly change the results obtained from the averaged data .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as the following . in section  [ sec : without - msw ] , the constraints on the fluxes without introducing particle physics effects are obtained .",
    "the joint fit of the combined the homestake , kamiokande , sage , and gallex data yields a poor @xmath27 value .",
    "the best fit is , in fact , obtained for a negative @xmath0be flux , suggesting a serious problem with the experiments _ or _ the existence of new particle physics effects : a distortion of the @xmath1b spectrum and/or neutral current contributions from @xmath5 or @xmath6 in kamiokande .",
    "even if we accept this poor fit assuming standard neutrinos , the constraint on the fluxes contradicts nonstandard solar models in general .",
    "the constraints on the fluxes will be displayed in the @xmath0be@xmath1b , @xmath2@xmath0be , and @xmath2@xmath1b planes .",
    "( for simplicity , we refer to neutrino fluxes in units of the reference fluxes listed in table  [ tab : bp - fluxes ] unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "those fluxes correspond to the bahcall - pinsonneault fluxes with the helium diffusion effect @xcite ) .",
    "the results when one of the three experiments are omitted will be also given . by ignoring one experiment ,",
    "the uncertainties in the flux constraints become larger , but the constraints are consistent with those obtained from all data , and again contradict astrophysical / nuclear solutions .    in section",
    "[ sec : without - msw ] , we also discuss possible constraints on the fluxes from the next generation experiments .",
    "in fact , if no new particle effects are present , sno and super - kamiokande will determine the initial @xmath1b flux with a high precision , and borexino , hellaz , and heron will measure the initial @xmath0be flux exclusively .",
    "the flux constraints from hypothetical results from these experiments with various central values and various measurement uncertainties will be examined .    in section  [ sec : with - msw ] , we consider the constraints on the fluxes when the two - flavor msw effect for transitions @xmath28 or @xmath29 is present .",
    "our analysis scheme can in principle be applied to other particle physics scenarios , such as three - flavor msw , transitions into sterile neutrinos , vacuum oscillations , a large neutrino magnetic moment , neutrino decays , flavor changing neutral currents , violation of the equivalence principle , etc .",
    "we consider the two - flavor msw solution because of its simplicity and viability .",
    "it is likely that if two - flavor msw is indeed occurring , there will be enough complementary information [ e.g. , from spectral distortions , day - night asymmetries , and sno neutral current ( nc ) measurements ] to establish it as the most likely candidate even allowing nonstandard solar models @xcite .",
    "of course one could never rigorously exclude the possibility of more complicated scenarios , such as the simultaneous importance of transitions into @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) and sterile neutrinos , which would interfere with the model independent flux determinations . for this",
    ", one must invoke occam s razor .",
    "once the msw parameters are introduced as additional free parameters in the joint fit , constraining the fluxes from the data is not trivial .",
    "the msw effect can distort the energy spectrum depending on the parameters , and can change the contribution from different flux components . with the existing data",
    ", we can constrain the @xmath1b flux only roughly . even though the chlorine and gallium experiments have a sensitivity to the @xmath0be flux",
    ", the survival probability of the flux can be zero for the msw small - angle ( nonadiabatic ) solution , and no meaningful constraint is obtained for the @xmath0be flux . to constrain the fluxes and the msw parameters simultaneously ,",
    "we need results from the future experiments , especially the neutral current measurement in sno and the @xmath0be neutrino measurement in borexino , hellaz , or heron .",
    "the neutrino - electron scattering mode in these @xmath0be measurements has a sensitivity to the neutral current interactions with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , whose cross sections are 21% of @xmath30 s at this energy .",
    "we will present the possible constraints assuming various outcomes from those experiments , and show that such a model independent analysis can determine the solar neutrino spectrum with an accuracy sufficient to test solar model predictions .",
    "we note that our choice of the hypothetical results from the sno nc and borexino experiments are minimal ; additional information from the sno charged current ( cc ) rate , the super - kamiokande rate , and the spectral and day - night asymmetry measurements in sno and super - kamiokande should make the constraints even better .",
    "we consider the constraints on the neutrino fluxes from the updated solar neutrino data listed in table  [ tab : expdata ] .",
    "the main results are displayed in the @xmath0be@xmath1b plane ( although some of the results are also shown in the @xmath2@xmath0be and @xmath2@xmath1b planes ) . when the data are fit , the the pp and cno fluxes are varied freely for each @xmath31 and @xmath32 , subject only to the luminosity constraint .",
    "this representation in the @xmath0be@xmath1b plane is effective since it can display every possible solar model , standard or nonstandard , that satisfies our minimal assumptions .",
    "since predictions for those fluxes vary substantially from model to model , the @xmath0be@xmath1b plane also provides a useful diagnostic for experimentally distinguishing competing solar models .    when the kamiokande , homestake , and the combined gallium experiments of sage and gallex are fit separately , the constraints on the @xmath0be and @xmath1b fluxes are shown in fig .",

    "although the constraint is weak , it is consistent with the ssm predictions and already excludes ( in the msw context ) some of the nonstandard models with a smaller @xmath1b flux .",
    "since half of the ssm @xmath1b flux is seen in kamiokande and since the msw effect only reduces observed rates , the @xmath1b flux can not be too small .",

    "we answer these questions quantitatively in the model independent framework , assuming two - flavor msw oscillations , since it is the simplest solution of the solar neutrino problem and most successful in describing the existing data .",
    "we assume that the measurement of the charged to neutral current ratio in sno will establish neutrino oscillations .",

    "this will clearly distinguish the standard and nonstandard solar models and perhaps even constrain the ssm parameters .",
