    "binary sensor networks have become widespread in environmental monitoring applications because binary sensors generate as little as one bit of information , thereby providing inexpensive sensing with minimal communication requirements @xcite .",
    "the motivation for our study is the theoretical prediction of the best achievable accuracy in localisation of a source of hazardous release of gas or aerosols , using such a binary sensor network .",
    "however , the formulation of the problem will be general enough to be applicable to parameter estimation of any emitting source , including the source of sound , vibration , seismic activity , radiation , etc .",
    "the paper derives the theoretically smallest achievable second - order estimation error in the form of the cramr - rao lower bound @xcite .",
    "the derivation is carried out in the bayesian framework , that is , assuming that some prior knowledge of source parameters is available . to our best knowledge , this type of cramr - rao bound ( crb ) , for source parameter estimation using binary sensors , has not been derived earlier .",
    "the closest references are @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a crb is derived for a quantised sensor network in the context of target localisation .",
    "however , the bound in @xcite is limited to the received signal strength ( rss ) measurement model only .",
    "hence , the bound we derive is more general , albeit restricted to binary quantisation . a special case of the crb we derive appeared in @xcite .",
    "finally , a crb for tracking a moving target using a binary sensor network and rss measurements was presented in @xcite , although it is not clear how and where the likelihood function of binary sensors was used in derivation .",
    "the problem is to derive the lower bound of estimation error for the parameter vector @xmath0 . in the context of source estimation ,",
    "the parameter vector typically includes not only the source parameters , such as its location ( coordinates ) , size , and the release - rate ( intensity ) , but also the propagation and measurement model parameters , such as the attenuation factors , meteorological parameters , and sensor characteristics .",
    "the measurement at @xmath1th sensor , @xmath2 , is a scalar ( e.g. concentration of the gas , the amount of received energy ) .",
    "before it is binary quantised , the `` analog '' measurement is modelled by : @xmath3 where    * @xmath4 is the dispersion or propagation measurement model , which includes the sensor index @xmath1 in the subscript being a function of the sensor location ; * @xmath5 is additive white zero - mean gaussian noise , independent of noise processes in other sensors : @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the actual measurement supplied by sensor @xmath1 is binary , that is : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the threshold .",
    "the probability of binary measurement @xmath9 can then be expressed as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the complementary cumulative distribution function of gaussian noise .",
    "let us now group all binary sensor measurements into a vector : @xmath12^\\intercal$ ] .",

    "our goal is to derive the analytic expression for the information matrix @xmath30 as a function of @xmath4 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath8 .",
    "then the crb will follow as the inverse matrix of @xmath30 .",

    "the crb is according to ( [ e : fim1 ] ) and ( [ e : pd ] ) defined as @xmath39 , and is often referred to as the _ posterior _ crb , in order to emphasize that it includes the contributions from both the prior and the measurements .    in order to derive the expression for @xmath40 , note first that @xmath41 is the hessian operator with respect to @xmath16 : @xmath42 \\label{e : hess}\\ ] ] next , let us write the expression for the log - likelihood function , which follows from ( [ e : like ] ) : @xmath43\\ ] ] after a few steps of mathematical manipulations it can be shown that the first partial derivative of the log - likelihood is : @xmath44\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath45 .",

    "since in this case all @xmath55 , @xmath56 are equal and denoted @xmath57 , from ( [ e : final ] ) it follows that : @xmath58 this expression appears in eq.(7 ) of @xcite .",
