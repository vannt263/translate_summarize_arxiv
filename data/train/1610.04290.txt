    "neurodegenerative diseases are poorly understood and represent one of the major challenges to modern medicine  @xcite . among these maladies , many are known to be tightly related to proteins that are present in the human brain .",
    "these proteins show similar traits .",
    "one is the tendency to form amyloid fibers within neurons and/or outside them  @xcite .",
    "another is the high mechanical polymorphism as assessed by single - molecule force spectroscopy  @xcite for polyglutamine tracts ( polyq , also denoted as q@xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of residues ) as well as a - synuclein , b - amyloid , and sup35 nm . all of them are amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins ( idps )  @xcite . in equilibrium",
    ", idps may adopt a number of different conformations and interconvert in a nanosecond timescale  @xcite .",
    "the mechanical polymorphism of q@xmath0 has been demonstrated to follow from a conformational one , which was characterized theoretically for @xmath1 between 16 and 80 in ref .",
    "@xcite by following the meta - dynamics methods used by cossio _",
    "_ for polyvaline ( polyv , denoted also as v@xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been found that about 9.3% of the 246 structurally independent q@xmath0 conformers obtained for @xmath2 were knotted compared to about 3.6% of the structures obtained for polyv of the same length  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that some knotted structures can be spotted in the cath database  @xcite which reperesents superfamilies of proteins as classified by their secondary structure motifs .",
    "we have checked that the previous version of cath used for making comparisons in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ( 5403 structures with the sequential length smaller than 250 ) contains 71 knotted proteins , smaller than 0.5% .",
    "the knotprot database  @xcite , devoted to proteins with knots , indicates that the smallest known knotted protein is mj0366 from _ methanocaldococcus jannaschii _",
    "@xcite  it comprises 87 residues , which is above the range of length considered in the q@xmath0 systems in  @xcite .",
    "its folding pathways have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the knots in the q@xmath3 set  @xcite was of the three - twist ( @xmath4 ) kind , with five intersections .",
    "such a knot can be found in the protein data bank ( pdb )  @xcite . in particular , it is present in ubiquitin hydrolase uch - l3 ( pdb code 1xd3 ) , a protein that deconjugates ubiquitin before degradation in the proteasome .",
    "thus , the knot in this protein has been hypothesized to confer resistance to proteasomal unfolding  @xcite .",
    "all of the remaining knots identified in q@xmath3 and all the ones found in v@xmath3 were of the common trefoil kind ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "no knots were found for @xmath1 smaller than 35",
    ". since the polyq systems are idps , all the conformations , including the knotted ones , are transient .",
    "however , knots in polyq last for hundreds of nanoseconds  @xcite , two orders of magnitude longer than unknotted conformations . properties of the globular knotted proteins are reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "v@xmath3 is an artificial protein , in the sense that it can not be found in nature .",
    "it was constructed to demonstrate that only a fraction of possible folds is adopted by proteins collected in the cath database , implying a selective role of evolution , and perhaps also of physical constraints , in favouring certain folds  @xcite .",
    "this topic has been discussed for idps in ref .",
    "however , long polyq tracts arise in nature near the n - terminus of several proteins , such as huntingtin , atrophin-1 ( atn1 ) , androgen receptor ( ar ) and several ataxins ( atxn ) .",
    "huntingtin is known to be essential in embryonic development  @xcite , and is considered to be related to gene expression regulation  @xcite as well as to anchoring or transport of vesicles  @xcite .    nonetheless , before translation",
    ", the genes encoding for these proteins contain long cytosine - adenine - guanine ( cag ) repeats , which encode for the polyq region .",
    "these cag repeats are prone to due to slippage of the dna polymerase  @xcite that elongates the number of cag repeats in the gene and , therefore , the length of the polyq tracts .",
    "if the length of the polyq tract in the aforementioned proteins is greater than a ( disease - dependent ) threshold , they cause neurodegenerative diseases such as huntington , dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy ( atn1 ) , spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( ar ) and many spinocerebellar ataxias ( atxn ) . huntington disease , in particular , leads to progressive motor and cognitive impairments . the non - pathological length of the polyq tract in huntingtin may start at 7 and is usually between 16 and 20 repeats  @xcite , while the pathogenic threshold is around 35 residues .",
    "the mutant huntingtin protein easily forms toxic oligomers and highly ordered amyloid fibers  @xcite and the toxicity of the olygomers may result from interactions with the membrane and perturbation of the calcium regulation  @xcite . nonetheless , other mechanisms point to toxicity appearing at different stages : either in the fibrillar state or at the monomeric level .",
    "in particular , a cell microinjection assay  @xcite has proved the toxicity of the monomers .",
    "the mechnisms of the monomeric toxicity can be related to the damage of the degradation machinery  @xcite . here ,",
    "we propose that the toxicity may be due to the presence of knots in q@xmath0 with @xmath1 exceeding the disease threshold of about 35  the typical sequential size , @xmath6 , of a knot found in q@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the knot - end locations are defined operationally through systematic cutting - away of the residues from both termini until the knot disintegrates  @xcite .",
    "location @xmath7 denotes the end that is closer to the n - terminus and @xmath8 the one further away .",
    "the knots in q@xmath3 are shallow since @xmath8 is always near the c - terminus , between sites 53 and 58 , whereas @xmath7 is between 16 and 23 @xcite",
    ". nonetheless , since the polyq tract is close to the n - terminus of huntingtin , a knot in it would actually be deep .",
    "the evident lack of the n - to - c - termini symmetry reflects most likely the directionality of the peptide chain .",
    "nevertheless the locations of the q@xmath3 knot ends are seen to be much better defined and closer apart than those of the v@xmath3 ends  @xcite .    for the sake of comparison with q@xmath3 , we also consider four proteins that have a ( non - transient ) knot in their native state as they provide a well defined reference situation .",
    "three of them are deeply knotted : the frequently studied methyltransferase yibk ( pdb code 1j85 chain a , 156 residues )  @xcite , rna methyltransferase ybea  @xcite ( 1ns5 chain a , 153 residues ) , and ubiquitin hydrolase uch - l3  @xcite ( 1xd3 chain a , 229 residues ) .",
    "the fourth one , the just mentioned mj0366  @xcite ( 2efv chain a , 82 residues ) , has a knot that is shallow .",
    "uch - l3 contains a three - twist knot and the remaining proteins have trefoil knots .",
    "we shall use the pdb structure codes to refer to these proteins in a unified manner .",
    "the relevance of the conformations with knots is that they may derail the degradation processes in the recycling machinery of the cell that are carried out by proteasomes , which would then lead to an increase in the concentration of the neurotoxic conformers .",
    "derailing of the degradation machinery may occur either through a significant elongation of the degradation time or by an abandonment of the process only after a partial proteolysis .",
    "the idea that knotted globular proteins may disable proteasomes has been suggested by virnau _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the context of protein uch - l3 but it has not been demonstrated . here , we use a simplified model of the proteasome  @xcite and show that indeed jamming may take place both for the globular knotted proteins and for the transient knotted conformations in idps .",
    "we show that the degree to which the degradation is disabled depends on the protein , on its conformation , and on the terminus at which the intake into the proteasome starts .",
    "it also depends on the value of the effective pulling force of the molecular motor involved : the lower the force , the bigger the impediment . whenever the probability of derailing the process of degradation is non - zero",
    ", an accumulation and aggregation of the toxic molecules would set in .",
    "although the term `` proteasome '' applies to the protein - degrading complexes in eukaryotes and archea  @xcite , we use it here in a general sense . in bacteria , examples of similar complexes are clpxp and lon proteases  @xcite .",
    "the process of protein degradation is carried out in atp - dependent proteases .",
    "all such proteses share a common shape : four stacked rings forming an axial channel and an inner catalytic chamber .",
    "we model the proteasome complex to be funnel - shaped and be endowed with impenetrable walls  @xcite .",
    "the funnel is composed of a torus that is fused together with a long cylinder as shown in the middle panel of fig .  [ situation ] .",
    "the detailed value of the geometrical parameters in our model are meant to render the structure of the proteasome derived in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "protocols of pulling considered in the paper .",
    "protocol 0 is the typical afm - like pulling .",
    "protocol i corresponds to the natural action of the proteasome .",
    "protocol ii is used in the measurements of the stalling force .",
    "the bottom panel defines the forces involved , as discussed in the text . ]",
    "a proteasome operates as a molecular engine in that it attracts a ( tagged ) protein into its entrance and translocates it down its channel into the catalytic chamber where the protein is lysed into short peptides . in our model ,",
    "the mechanical aspects of this action are mimicked by an application of a pulling force @xmath9 whereas degradation itself is identified with translocation through a reference plane .",
    "an alternative and more detailed way to imitate the mechanics involved is to impose allosteric transformations in the proteins constituting the proteasome  @xcite . however , our simpler model has the advantage of accessing long time scales and generating a substantial number of trajectories that are necessary to statistically assess the role of the knotted structures .",
    "it also allows for a straightforward comparison with the situations in which the force is applied periodically , the pulling is performed at a constant speed , @xmath10 , or when mechanical unfolding takes place without the proteasome .",
    "this simplified model does not describe the actual proteolysis nor the release of partially degraded proteins .",
    "we have used this model  @xcite to characterize the nature of protein unfolding in the proteasome and to demonstrate that the stalling force measured by single - molecule force spectroscopy techniques  @xcite may be smaller than the traction force of the unfoldase motor because one needs to include a mechanical reaction force , @xmath11 , of the proteasome against which the protein is pushing , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ situation ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "our model uses a simplified coarse - grained model of the protein  @xcite in which the amino acid residues are represented by effective atoms located at the positions of the @xmath12-c atoms and the solvent is implicit .",
    "the characteristic value of @xmath9 is , as of yet , unknown .",
    "nonetheless , it has been demonstrated  @xcite that degradation takes place at a rate of about 80 residues per second .",
    "our approach in ref .",
    "@xcite was to determine the characteristic time of translocation as a function of @xmath9 and then to extrapolate it to the time corresponding to the degradation of the studied protein at the experimental rate .",
    "here , we study properties as a function of @xmath9 to get the sense of changes involved but do not actually extrapolate .",
    "we consider three protocols of protein unfolding as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ situation ] .",
    "protocol 0 involves no proteasome : one terminus is attached to an anchored elastic spring while the other one is pulled . in protocol",
    "i , one terminus is dragged into the proteasome and the other is free .",
    "protocol ii is similar , but the previously free terminus is attached to a spring which exerts a backward force , @xmath13 . pulling",
    "may be applied either to the n- or the c - terminus .",
    "the specific protocol used will be denoted as , for example , i - n and i - c respectively .",
    "it must be noted that obstruction for degradation in the i - n protocol does not imply an obstruction in the i - c protocol .",
    "the obstruction shows as jamming in our model and we shall use this term as a shorthand designation . in each of these protocols , pulling may take place in various modes .",
    "we consider the cases of a constant pulling speed , a constant pulling force and a force applied periodically .",
    "the last mode is the closest to how the proteasome actually operates since the process is controlled by the intermittent supply of the atp molecules .",
    "measurement of the stalling force has been done using mode ii in experiments  @xcite .",
    "stalling occurs when the protein is unable to translocate . in the experiments performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , this happened when the opposing force @xmath13 is such that there is no translocation . we have argued  @xcite that @xmath13 is not equal to @xmath9 as commonly assumed , but to @xmath14 by the third law of mechanics . here",
    ", we revise this issue and show that using an all - atom model of the protein combined with an explicit solvent also supports our previous finding about the interpretation of the measured stalling force .",
    "it should be noted that in our model , we separate all forces acting on the protein into two parts : the motor - like pulling and the reaction of the proteasome that resists the entry because of steric interactions .",
    "our interpretation of the stalling experiments experiments is that one measures the total force @xmath15 and not just @xmath9 .",
    "our model of the proteasome has been introduced recently in ref .",
    "it assumes that the funnel - like geometry of the proteasome complex can be represented as an effective external potential , in analogy to several models of translocation through cylindrical channels  @xcite .",
    "the potential has axial symmetry , which reflects the fact that the two substructures of the biological proteasome  the 20s core particle , made out of four heptameric rings , and the two 19s regulatory caps  share an axial channel .",
    "the outer two rings of 19s caps form a gate where the polyubiquitin chains that are attached to the protein get recognized so that the protein is directed to the core chamber , leaving the chains behind ( in the case of clpxp , the proteins are tagged by short peptides at a terminus and the tags enter the proteolytic chamber ) .",
    "the catalytic action takes place in the inner surface of the two rings in the middle of 20s .",
    "the target protein enters one of the caps and then moves further down the axial channel .",
    "the cap is represented by a torus and the channel by a cylinder .",
    "the channel is considered to be indefinitely long as we do not model the actual degradation . as a result ,",
    "only one cap is included in the model and the protein can not emerge `` on the other side '' and refold .",
    "the combined torus - cylinder shape defines the funnel .",
    "the radius of the channel has been found experimentally to be @xmath16    @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the average distance between opposing heavy atoms on the inner side of the proteasome .",
    "we consider the channel to have a radius @xmath17   to account for flexibile adjustments of the channel .",
    "this channel is wide enough to accomodate a hydrated polypeptide and some elements of secondary structure .",
    "the torus is described by the equation @xmath18 , where the major radius is @xmath19   and the minor radius is @xmath20   .",
    "the opening in the narrowest place of the torus has a radius of 7   , which is smaller than the radius of the cylindrical channel describing the core particle .",
    "this disparity accounts for an extra cavity - like space that forms between the cap and the core particle .    in protocols i",
    "- c and i - n , the reference plane is defined as one shifted 25   inward with respect to the equatorial plane of the torus  where the opening in the funnel is the narrowest .",
    "the shift is introduced to make sure that the rear terminus is definitely within the cylinder . in protocol",
    "ii , the criterion involved is arriving at an end - to - end extension which is equal to 85% of the backbone length .",
    "if a protein is knotted at the beginning , the evolution of the knot is followed during unfolding to check whether at the end it has tightened , untied or remained in place .",
    "the interaction between the effective atoms of the protein and the surface of the torus as well as the inner surface of the cylindrical channel is assumed to be repulsive and given by the truncated lennard - jones ( lj ) potential as follows @xmath21 & , & d_{i } \\le r_{min } \\\\ 0 & ,        & d_{i } > r_{min }   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the smallest distance between the @xmath23th residue and the torus / channel surface .",
    "the distance @xmath24   is the position of the minimum of the potential , which takes into account excluded volumes of residues and wall atoms .",
    "we take @xmath25   .",
    "the energy parameter @xmath26 comes from our coarse - grained structure - based  @xcite model of the substrate protein / peptide  @xcite  it is equal to the depth of the lj potential associated with the contacts : @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the contacts are determined by using the criterion of atomic overlaps  the procedure denoted as ov in the detailed description of several approaches to the contact - map determination presented in ref .",
    "these contacts are only native in the case of globular proteins , whereas for the polyq chains they are determined from the conformation at hand  @xcite .",
    "the value of the @xmath26 is approximately equal to 106  pn@xmath28 , which correlates well with the experimental data on stretching at constant speed , after extrapolating to the speeds used in the experiments  @xcite .",
    "the length parameters @xmath29 in the contact potentials are determined so that the potential minimum agrees with the native distances between @xmath23 and @xmath30 .",
    "bonded interactions are modelled by a harmonic potential with the spring constant of 50  @xmath31 .",
    "the local backbone stiffness is described by the chirality potential  @xcite .",
    "the solvent is represented by damping and random fluctuational forces , the amplitude of which depends on the temperature , @xmath32 .",
    "our simulations are performed at @xmath33 which is close to the optimal folding @xmath32 of the model proteins  @xcite ( @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant ) . with our calibration of @xmath26",
    "this choice is also consistent with studies performed in a vicinity of the room temperature .",
    "the time unit , @xmath35 , in the simulations is of order 1  ns due to overdamping .",
    "the initial placement of the protein / polypeptide relative to the proteasome model is based on the following procedure .",
    "both termini are located on the main axis of the proteasome and away from the torus .",
    "the protein is then moved towards the torus in small steps until one of the heavy atoms collides with it .",
    "the placement just before this last step is taken as the starting state .",
    "henceforth , in the coarse - grained model , only the @xmath12-c representation is used dynamically .",
    "the coordinate reference system is chosen so that the central axis of the cylinder is along the @xmath36 axis . in protocol",
    "i , translocation is said to take place if all of the system moves past the reference plane defined before .",
    "the time needed to accomplish this defines the translocation time , @xmath37 . in protocol",
    "ii , the characteristic time corresponds to achieving a nearly full extension ( 85% ) .    in the part where polyq is considered ,",
    "the structures are taken from  @xcite .",
    "htt , which stands here for the exon 1 of huntingtin , was obtained by homology modelling using modeller  @xcite . knotted and unknotted htt are based on two templates : the structured regions were taken from the x - ray - resolved 17-glutamine structure under the pdb code 3ior  @xcite , while the ( knotted or unknotted ) polyq from ref .",
    "@xcite were used as templates for the polyq region .",
    "10 models were done for each conformation , each one was checked to preserve the knotting state ( htt must be knotted if polyq was knotted and _ vice versa _ ) and the lowest - energy configuration from those was chosen to stretch .    in the final part of this work , we consider an unknotted protein which represents a model protein in the field of single - molecule force spectroscopy , the i27 domain of cardiac titin whose pdb structure code is 1tit and which has a net charge of @xmath38 .",
    "we reexamine the issue of the stalling force  now by using all - atom simulations .",
    "these simulations were performed by using the gromacs 4.6.5 package  @xcite with the amber99 force field  @xcite .",
    "the molecules of water are described within the tip3p model  @xcite .",
    "the time integration of the equations of motion was performed using the leap - frog algorithm with a time step of 1  fs .",
    "we have added 64 na@xmath39 and 58 cl@xmath40 ions to neutralize the system and to keep the nearly physiological ionic strength of 150  mm .",
    "the gromacs - based model was augmented with the potential due to the proteasome walls ( eq .  [ eq : ljcut ] ) constructed in the same fashion as in the coarse - grained simulations except that now the cylinder needs to have a finite length .",
    "the system was placed within a cuboid box with the extension of 100   in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 directions and 200   in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "the long direction of the cuboid coincided with the central axis of the proteasome model and the equatorial plane of the torus is 135   away from the bottom the system .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used .",
    "the water molecules are allowed to be above the plane corresponding to the top of the torus and within the inside of the proteasome model . due to the periodic boundary conditions",
    ", the water molecules can also be at the bottom of the cuboid box , _",
    "i. e. _ underneath the end of the cylinder ( which has a finite length in all - atom simulations ) .",
    "there are also two repulsive walls so that the cylinder is not surrounded by water .",
    "one is at the bottom of the cylinder ( at 7   above the bottom of the whole system ) and another at the top of the torus ( away from the center ) .",
    "the equilibration of water in the initial stage was implemented through 1  ns while holding the protein frozen in its native state .",
    "when determining the forces of interactions with the proteasome walls , all the atoms of the protein and water are considered as having a radius of 2   and the wall itself is thought of as being made of atoms also with a radius of 2   .",
    "a purely repulsive potential for interactions with the wall of the funnel leads to an expulsion of water from the proteasome model ( without affecting the protein ) . in order to hold the water in ,",
    "we consider a modified attractive lj potential  augmented by the term @xmath43  where the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 were selected so that both the force and the potential vanish at 7   ( slightly smaller than the radius of the cylinder ) .",
    "the energy parameter was taken to be 4  kj / mol .",
    "it should be noted that this value is an order of magnitude larger than , say , the c  c energy parameter in the amber99 force field , 0.359824  kj / mol .",
    "the reason for this resides in the fact that the cylinder has no atomic structure and larger values are needed .",
    "vmd  @xcite has been used for the representation of protein structures .",
    "there is no constant speed pulling in real proteasomes .",
    "however , this mode of action allows one to derive a characteristic force which is also of relevance for constant force situations as it approximately corresponds to a crossover between the low and high force behaviors  @xcite .",
    "consideration of the constant speed processes also sheds light on possible hindrances to translocation and allows for a direct comparison to typical constant - velocity experiments in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) .    at constant @xmath10 ,",
    "one monitors the tension , @xmath46 , in the backbone and studies it as a function of the displacement , @xmath47 , of the spring that is attached to the pulled end of the protein .",
    "the characteristic force , @xmath48 , associated with a protein is defined as the height of the maximal isolated force peak .",
    "it depends on @xmath10 in a weak way ( approximately logaritmically ) so one may state that @xmath48 refers to a certain narrow range of relevant forces .",
    "we take @xmath10 to be 0.005  /@xmath35 , which is typically two orders of magnitude faster than in the afm experiments ( in the absence of a proteasome ) .",
    "in addition to determining @xmath49 , we monitor the time dependence of the sequential location of the knot ends . when pulled without the proteasome ,",
    "the knot ends have been discovered to jump to preferred locations  @xcite , instead of moving in a diffusive manner , until getting tightened maximally .",
    "[ vel1j85 ] provides an illustration of the @xmath49 plots for 1j85 obtained in the five protocols of pulling .",
    "we have considered 100 trajectories .",
    "for the i - n protocol about 50% of the trajectories lead to jamming combined with the tightening of the knot .",
    "the motion of the knot ends along the sequence is shown in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ vel1j85 ] . the remaining 50% lead to translocation , as shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ stuckvel ] , combined with untying of the knots in which the knot ends move to the termini , which means that the knot disappears . in all other protocols , all trajectories lead to jamming in which the knot may or may not change location .",
    "typically , jamming involves the knot being unable to enter the cylindrical channel .",
    "example @xmath46@xmath47 recordings for 1j85 in the different pulling protocols at a constant speed .",
    "the top - right panel shows the locations of the knot ends in protocol",
    "i - n for two trajectories . in one trajectory ( dotted blue lines ) ,",
    "the knot unties and the protein translocates . in the other ( solid black lines ) , the protein jams the channel and the tightened knot arrives at a permanent location .",
    "the profiles have been selected out of 100 trajectories for each protocol .",
    "the profiles shown in the middle - right panel correspond to the trajectories shown in the top - right panel . ]     two example trajectories that lead to translocation of knotted species .",
    "the left panels show translocation of 1j85 when pulled in the i - n protocol and the right ones the unfolding of a htt@xmath3 knotted conformation .",
    "the knot is marked with yellow . in the case of htt@xmath3 ,",
    "the polyq part is marked in red . ]",
    "the @xmath49 patterns are seen to be visibly affected by the presence of the proteasome and , in particular , the values of @xmath48 are generally different than those in protocol 0 .",
    "note that stretching in protocol 0 invariably leads to knot tightening whereas the action of the proteasome model may also lead to the knot slipping off the backbone , especially if the knot is shallow .",
    "it is interesting to note that knotted proteins pulled by the proteasome have @xmath48 larger than in its absence . on averaging over the trajectories , for 1j85",
    "we get @xmath50 of 1.85 , 2.67 , 3.13 , 2.48 , and 3.09  @xmath31 for protocols 0 , i - c , i - n , ii - c , and ii - n respectively . for 1ns5 ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are 1.97 , 2.71 , 2.50 , 2.42 and 2.69  @xmath31 .    in the case of 1ns5",
    "( see s1  fig . ) , protocols i - c and ii - c may lead either to translocation or to jamming whereas protocol ii - n leads only to jamming .",
    "for protocol i - n , only about 4% of the trajectories end up in translocation .",
    "the knot is located near the c - terminus so one would expect that it unties readily during pulling by the n - terminus ; however , the opposite is observed . in the case of 1xd3 ( see s2  fig . ) , almost all i - c and ii - c trajectories lead to translocation . for i - n , 35% trajectories unfold and for ii - n  none .",
    "the values of @xmath50 exceed or equal ( in the case of protocol ii - n ) the @xmath50 for protocol 0 . for the shallowly knotted 2efv ( see s3  fig . ) , @xmath50 in protocols i and",
    "ii is close to that in protocol 0 ( within 0.1  @xmath31 ) .",
    "the knot easily unties in protocols i - n and i - c and translocation is unhindered .",
    "however , in protocol ii - c , there is no instance of translocation whereas in ii - n translocation occurs with a probability of 30% .",
    "the knot ends are at sites 11 and 73 ( the full length of the protein is 87 , but the structure of the first five residues is unknown and therefore the model does not include them ) .",
    "we conclude that keeping the backward terminus supported , as in the experiments on the stalling force , affects the physical outcome of the process .",
    "for instance protein 2efv translocates in protocol i - c but it does not in protocol ii - c .",
    "also , protocol ii precludes untying of knots .",
    "we now consider the constant velocity pulling of q@xmath51 and q@xmath3 , below and above the pathological threshold , respectively , of most polyq - related diseases including huntington .",

    "[ stalling ] shows the probability of the molecule not being able to translocate in the simulation time ( @xmath61 ) , which we operationally define as a stalling of the proteasome .",

    "considering , for example , proteins 1j85 and 1ns5 , the former jams the proteasome during constant speed , but is degraded in the periodic force protocol while the latter jams the proteasome sometimes ( 68% ) at constant speed , but is slightly worse processed in the periodic force protocol than 1j85 , see fig .",

    "furthermore , we observe a maximum similar to the case of 1ns5 , but at a lower @xmath9 ( @xmath76 ) . in any case , the translocation of knotted conformations typically takes more time than the unknotted ones , and is expected to take even longer at low forces , suggesting that the protein degradation machinery might be stalled , or at least hindered , by the knotted conformations .",
    "the allosteric action of a proteasome involves not only traction down the channel but also lateral fluctuational changes in the shape of the intake opening  @xcite .",
    "we now address the question of how to incorporate such rotation in a model with an effective potential .",
    "the front ring of the proteasome consists of six proteins with loops that form the entrance to the funnel .",

    "these local deformations are not necessarily consecutive around the entrance  there is a strong random component",
    ". however , there appears to be a rotation - like correlation in the events  @xcite .",

    "this model requires to expand the cylindrical part of the funnel  the radius of the cylinder is boosted from 8  to 12    to allow for a smooth welding of the two parts of the funnel .",
    "otherwise , a gap between the cylinder and the smaller sphere would form . in the expanded channel ,",
    "the protein may have enough space to refold . in order to prevent this",
    ", we gradually reduce the strength of the protein contacts in the channel to 0 .",
    "the molecular motor features of our model include the application of a pulling force @xmath9 combined with the periodic reduction of the radii of three spheres .",

    "compared to the model in which the spheres do not change the radii , the translocation times at low forces get shorter than in the torus - and - cylinder model ( by about 84% at an @xmath9 of 1.35  @xmath31 and 20% at 1.6  @xmath31 : the lower the force , the stronger the effect ) .",
    "the reason for the larger effectiveness is that the unfolding process at the entrance is helped by the time - varying shape of the funnel and translocation is improved by the wider cylinder .",
    "we find ( by freezing the spheres ) that both effects are comparable and become more important as @xmath9 is reduced .",
    "however , the enhancement by moving spheres dominates at low forces .",
    "nonetheless , the rotational mechanism is found not to improve translocation of deeply knotted proteins beyond what the model with non - changing spheres already does . unlike the smooth funnel model used at constant @xmath10 or",

    ", @xmath60 gets smaller , especially at lower forces .",
    "the interesting part is that adding the lateral rotation related to the time - dependent radius of the spheres does not bring any improvement .",
    "the reason is that translocation of the knotted proteins does not depend on any additional lateral forces but on the possibility of untying in the idle part of each period .",
    "the resulting misfolding during the idle times leads occasionaly to the pulled segment to return without threading through the knot - loop , _ i.e. _ to untying .",
    "the 12-sphere model , especially with the ratchet - like blocking mechanism , is probably the most realistic of the set of models considered here . however , its proper working depends on the adequate choice of the parameters .",

    "removal of all ions does not affect the tension at the back terminus .",
    "in a previous study  @xcite we have found that the ease of unfolding and translocation depends on the protein , on the protocol of pulling and on the value of @xmath9 .",
    "the same is true in the case of proteins with knots , but the added complexity of such proteins results in either jamming of the proteasome or , at least , an extension of the translocation times significantly .",
