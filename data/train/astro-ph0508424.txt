    "the star formation history , the mass distribution , and the stellar and gas dynamics on scales of less than a few parsecs in the nuclei of seyfert galaxies , are some of the main debated issues in the context of active galactic nuclei . the circinus galaxy , at a distance of @xmath11 mpc ( freeman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , is an ideal subject to study because of its proximity ( 1  = 20 pc ) .",
    "it is a large , highly inclined ( @xmath12 ) , spiral galaxy that hosts both a typical seyfert 2 nucleus and a circumnuclear starburst .",
    "this work comprises a summary of the results obtained after analyzing the sinfoni datacube of the circinus galaxy presented in mueller snchez et al .",
    "sinfoni comprises an adaptive optics facility ( ao - module ) , developed by eso ( bonnet et al .",
    "@xcite ) and spiffi , a nir integral field spectrograph developed by mpe ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "the ao - module consists of an optical relay from the telescope s cassegrain focus to the spiffi entrance focal plane , which includes a deformable mirror conjugated to the telescope pupil .",
    "the curvature is updated on the 60 actuators at 420 hz , with a closed - loop bandwidth of 3060 hz , to compensate for the aberrations produced by the turbulent atmosphere . under good atmospheric conditions an adequate correction",
    "can be obtained over the full @xmath13 arcmin@xmath14 fov with stars up to @xmath15 mag .",
    "the spiffi integral field spectrometer records simultaneously the spectra of all image points in a two - dimensional field of view .",
    "the image scale of spiffi allows sampled imaging at the diffraction limit of the telescope ( 0.0125/pix ) , seeing limited observations ( 0.125/pix ) and an intermediate image scale ( 0.05/pix ) , over a fov of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  respectively .",
    "the spectral resolution of the spectrometer ranges between 2000 - 5000 for the three covered atmospheric bands : @xmath19 ( 1.1@xmath1m1.4@xmath1 m ) , @xmath20 ( 1.45@xmath1m1.85@xmath1 m ) and @xmath21 ( 1.95@xmath1m2.45@xmath1 m ) .",
    "the instrument is fully cryogenic , and it is equipped with a rockwell 2k@xmath222k hawaii-2rg array .",
    "figure  [ spiffi ] shows an inside view of the main components of spiffi .",
    "the light enters from the top .",
    "the pre - optics with a filter wheel re - image the object plane from the ao module onto the image slicer , providing the three different image scales .",
    "the image slicer rearranges the two dimensional field onto a one - dimensional pseudo longslit .",
    "a grating wheel disperses the light and a short focal length camera then images the spectra on the detector .",
    "after some processing of the raw data , the outcome is a data cube with two spatial and one spectral dimensions .",
    "images of the 2@xmath23 continuum and the br@xmath2 and @xmath24 ( 1 - 0)s(1 ) line emission , as well as the @xmath25co(2 - 0 ) band flux are presented in figure  [ linemaps ] .",
    "the sinfoni psf was found to be wll represented by a symmetrical moffat function , with a fwhm spatial resolution of 0.2 .    in circinus , although the agn is highly obscured , it is revealed indirectly by the compact @xmath21-band non - stellar core .",
    "the fraction of stellar light in the nucleus is deduced from comparison of the @xmath26co(2 - 0 ) ) absorption bandhead with star clusters models .",
    "the intrinsic equivalent width is pretty much independent of star formation history for an ensemble of stars as predicted by the models , and it has an almost constant value of @xmath27(davies et al .",
    "the stellar continuum , which accounts for only @xmath615% of the total @xmath21-band luminosity in the central arcsec , shows a much broader distribution than the non - stellar part .",
    "this extended morphology is also reflected in the @xmath24 ( 1 - 0)s(1 ) and br@xmath2 line profiles . on these scales , less than 20 pc ,",
    "an exponential profile with @xmath28 = @xmath29 is an excellent match for each of the lines , consistent with the hypothesis that the stars and the molecular gas reside in a thickened disk or rotating spheroid , as suggested by the kinematics ( see section  [ starformation ] ) .",
    "we have partially resolved the non - stellar @xmath21-band source . a quadrature correction of its fwhm with that of the psf yields an intrinsic size of @xmath62 pc , consistent with that found by prieto et al . @xcite and also with the sizes predicted by the unification model , in which the hot dust ( @xmath61000 k ) lies @xmath61 pc away from the agn .",
    "as the agn is highly obscured , no broad line region is visible .",
    "this , together with the symmetry of the narrow line emission and its uniform velocity field , suggests that the br@xmath2 emission is associated with star formation activity surrounding the seyfert nucleus .",
    "this picture is supported by the similar morphologies in the br@xmath2 , @xmath25co(2 - 0 ) and h@xmath0 maps , and the consistency of the velocity fields and dispersion maps of the br@xmath2 with the h@xmath0 . by comparing the evolution of the @xmath30 and @xmath31/@xmath32 with time , a moderate duration of the star formation @xmath33 yr , and an age of @xmath34 yr fit best our observational constrains of @xmath30 = 30 and @xmath31/@xmath32 = @xmath35 @xmath36 yr@xmath37 , indicating the presence of a young stellar population within a few parsecs ( @xmath38 pc ) of the active nucleus .",
    "the projected velocity maps of the h@xmath0 ( 1 - 0)s(1 ) and the br@xmath2 lines show a velocity gradient consistent with simple rotation with the same major axis as the large scale galaxy as can be seen in figure  [ velmaps ] . by correcting the velocity maps for inclination",
    "( @xmath39 = 65@xmath40 ) , a rotation velocity of 75kms@xmath37 at 8 pc from the nucleus was found .",
    "the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the stars in the nuclear region is almost constant with a value of @xmath670kms@xmath37 . using these values",
    "we obtained an intrinsic velocity to dispersion ratio in the maps of @xmath3/@xmath4 @xmath5 1.1 because this ratio is @xmath61 , it is an indication that , in addition to rotation , random motions are also significant in the nuclear region .",
    "in our observations of circinus the highly ionised [ sivi ] , [ caviii ] and [ alix ] emission lines are detected . in all three profiles we observe asymmetric and broadened lines , indicating the presence of two or more components inside the coronal line region .",
    "indeed , the three asymmetric coronal lines were best fitted by the superposition of two gaussians as can be seen in figure  [ clprofiles ] for the case of the [ caviii ] emission line .",
    "the kinematics of the coronal gas were also analyzed by comparing the emission line profiles of the three coronal lines .",
    "figure  [ clprofiles ] also shows the results for the three high excitation lines detected with sinfoni .",
    "the blue shifted ( @xmath41 to @xmath42kms@xmath37 ) broad ( @xmath43300kms@xmath37 ) wing is spatially extended . on the other hand ,",
    "the narrow component is at systemic velocity and spatially compact .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the two components originate in different regions and could even be excited by different mechanisms . in the case of the broad component",
    ", its blue shift indicates that part of the gas must arise in outflows around the agn ( rodrguez - ardilla et al .",
    "the most likely scenario is that this comprises a multitude of outflowing cloudlets producing many narrow components at different velocities which combine to produce the observed morphology and profile .",
    "it has been suggested that similar out - flowing cloudlets in ngc1068 might arise from ablation of the larger clouds ( cecil et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of the narrow component ,",
    "the fact that it is compact , centered on the nucleus , and at the systemic velocity suggest that it originates physically close to the agn .",
    "the narrow line width ( @xmath6180kms@xmath37 ) indicates that they must be excited by photoionization from a hard ionising continuum ( oliva @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , we observe correlations between the ionisation potential ( ip ) and both the blueshift and relative strength of the broad wing , indicating that different species ( with different ip ) originate in different regions .",
    "we suggest that the higher ionization species have faster outflow velocities because they are closer to the agn where the radiative acceleration is stronger ( and the cloudlets have not been slowed by travelling a long distance through the interstellar medium ) , and weaker fluxes because there are fewer photons hard enough to ionise them .",
