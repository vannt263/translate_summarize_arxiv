    "when the dimensionless frequency @xmath23 exceeds a critical value , then the pattern immediately above onset consists of disordered domains of convection rolls known as domain chaos .",

    "the roll orientation is more or less uniform ; but different domains have different orientations @xcite .",
    "the domains are unstable and undergo a persistent but irregular dynamics . in this case , the time - averaged mean - square velocities and temperature deviations from the conduction state grow continuously from zero as @xmath11 is exceeded , i.e. the bifurcation is supercritical .",
    "chaos immediately above a supercritical bifurcation offers a unique opportunity for theoretical study because weakly - nonlinear theories are expected to be applicable .",
    "these theories , in the form of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) or swift - hohenberg ( sh ) equations , by virtue of their general structure and from their numerical solutions , predict that the inverse half - width at half - height @xmath0 of the structure factor ( sf , the power spectrum of the pattern ) should vary as @xmath24 with @xmath25 as @xmath26 vanishes @xcite , and that it is the only length scale in the problem .",
    "thus it was particularly disappointing that measurements for domain chaos disagreed with this expectation @xcite .",

    "experimental determinations of a characteristic length scale @xmath32 usually are based on numerical estimates of the variance @xmath33 of the sf , with @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "[ sub : skmethods ] we discuss two methods of determining the sf from patterns .",
    "the standard method , using the fourier power spectrum , is sensitive to the limited size of the experimental images @xcite .",
    "to overcome this limitation we also employed the maximum entropy method ( mem ) , which is discussed in detail in that section .",
    "the benefits of the mem are exhibited through analysis of images from a sh simulation detailed in sect .",
    "[ sub : simsh ] .",
    "we find that the mem is quite powerful in its ability to overcome the finite image - size problem .    in sect .",

    "the fits did not change the result @xcite @xmath6 that had been found before by the moment method .",
    "the reason why the moment method also gave this result can be found in the behavior of @xmath35 at large @xmath8 , where @xmath35 drops off fast enough for @xmath37 to be essentially proportional to @xmath0 . in the case of the mem",

    "the two results @xmath41 and @xmath40 conspire to retain the expected dependence of the total power on @xmath42 with @xmath43 even though both @xmath30 and @xmath44 do not have the expected value 1/2 . once again , we find that the mem overcomes the finite data length yielding @xmath45 .",
    "we also find that the result for @xmath30 and @xmath44 are not strongly dependent on @xmath46 for either the fourier analysis or the mem .",
    "thus we conclude that , in light of careful analysis using the mem , the experimental domain - chaos state does possess a length scale in agreement with the prediction from the gl model .    finally , in sect .",
    "[ sub : scaling_collapse ] , we examine the extent to which the sf can be represented by a unique scaling function over a range of @xmath3 and @xmath8 . we obtain excellent collapse of the data , both in the case of fourier analysis and the mem , when the results for @xmath0 obtained from a fit to the sf at each @xmath3 are used to scale the sf .",
    "in order to better understand the consequences of using numerical moments to compute the correlation length , we derived analytic expressions for the zeroth , first , and second moments of several proposed forms of the sf .",

    "the parameter @xmath101 controls the rate at which the window drops off as the edge of the image is approached .",
    "since the data was two dimensional , the window was the product of a one - dimensional window function in each direction . since the windowing function attenuates the signal around the edges of the image , it reduces the total power . to compensate for this we divided @xmath58 by a constant so that the total power in the final sf agreed with the total power of the raw image .",
    "the specific windowing function did not greatly affect the result for @xmath0 .",
    "we ultimately settled on using a kaiser - bessel window with @xmath19 for the results given in this paper .",
    "our major results , namely the exponents @xmath30 and @xmath44 and the scaling collapse of the sf , were independent of the windowing function .",
    "we used a fast fourier - transform ( fft ) algorithm @xcite capable of transforming images of arbitrary size to compute the sf so that no interpolation or zero padding was required to re - size the image to an integer power of two .",
    "we found that interpolation distorts the large-@xmath8 behavior of the sf because it smooths out random noise that is present in the original signal .",
    "the use of zero padding circumvents the smoothing of the noise and thus avoids this distortion at large @xmath8 , but instead inserts ringing at small @xmath8 . due to the easy availability of fft algorithms that can work on any size image and the speed of modern computers",
    ", there is no reason to sacrifice the behavior of the sf at either large or small @xmath8 .",
    "a minor tradeoff is that previous work utilized an aspect - ratio correction to the image that removed a slight anisotropy in the frame grabber @xcite . because this correction requires interpolation of the raw image we avoided using it .",
    "we expected only a very slight error by doing so because the raw images are nearly square .",
    "however , in the @xmath17 sample there was a radial distortion , due to optical aberration , that was strong enough to warrant its removal in order to avoid a systematic error in the length scale",
    ". we did not investigate the large @xmath8 behavior in that sample , so we expect no significant problem from the distortion correction .    even after dividing the experimental images by an optical background , the resulting sf",
    "still contained the non - deterministic part of the background spectrum present in the images taken below onset .",
    "since fluctuations @xcite are too feeble to be detected for the parameters of the present experiment , we attributed this background signal primarily to electronic noise and subtracted a background , determined below onset , from the sf above onset . as a result , for the case of experimental data , the analysis that follows",
    "is applied to the background subtracted sf @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the sf averaged over many images below the onset .",
    "we also applied the ft to simulations of the sh domain - chaos model . in that case",
    "there was no need to divide by a reference image or to subtract electronic noise , so we used @xmath58 computed directly from the simulation images .",
    "we attempted to overcome the finite image - size problem of the ft method by using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) to estimate @xmath58 .",
    "although this method is commonly used for 1d data @xcite , computing the spectrum of 2d data with this technique is still somewhat of an open problem @xcite .",

    "it was also shown previously @xcite that the mem is much less sensitive to short data lengths than standard fourier analysis .",

    "@xcite depends on an accurate estimate of the auto - correlation of the data .",
    "a central section is cut from the auto - correlation data and used in the iterative process .",

    "the number of coefficients @xmath109 determines the size of the continued region . in principle",
    "it is possible to use a relatively small continued - region size , in order to reduce the required amount of computation , and then embed the resulting @xmath109 into a larger region , setting higher order coefficients to zero in order to produce a finely meshed power spectrum . in practice we found that this approach , while advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , did not always produce positive - definite power spectra and thus was not stable for our purposes .",
    "instead we ran the entire algorithm on a large @xmath110 mesh for @xmath109 .",

    "typically we needed 50,000 to 1 million iterations for convergence , depending on the @xmath3 step , making the processing of all the data in the present work a fairly massive undertaking .    the number of iterations depended on the auto - correlation error @xmath111 , as defined by eq .  25 in ref .",

    "[ sub : experimental_measurement_xi ] , we found that we only needed @xmath113 for satisfactory convergence .",
    "this is likely due to the better statistics for the auto - correlation function in the case of the experiment due to the fact that we averaged the auto - correlation function over 4096 images per @xmath3 step in the experiment , but only 256 images per @xmath3 step in the simulation .",
