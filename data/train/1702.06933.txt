    "unlike a classic random walker , a quantum walk can be in a coherent superposition of several positions and exploring multiple trajectories over an _ n_-dimensional graph . in periodic systems , for example , the quantum particle propagates much faster ( ballistic propagation ) than its classical counterpart ( diffusive propagation )  @xcite .",
    "quantum walkers have been widely studied in a variety of different settings such as in the development of quantum algorithms  @xcite , efficient energy transfer in proteins complex  @xcite , classical optics  @xcite , waveguide lattices  @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , trapped atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , disorder  @xcite , interacting particles  @xcite and bacteria behavior in biological systems  @xcite .    despite the recent progress",
    ", many investigations on quantum walks are related to a single walker , primarily in the experimental scope .",
    "on the other hand , quantum effects are considerably enhanced in systems with more than one walker . in such cases , generalizations that consider many interacting walkers can provide useful information regarding to universal and efficient quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "interaction between walkers typically results in the appearance of entanglement and have been shown to improve certain aspects , such as in the graph isomorphism problem  @xcite .",
    "quantum walks of interacting and non - interacting quantum particles are fundamentally different in the context of solving the computational problem of graph isomorphism . in this case",
    ", it was reported that two interacting bosons are more powerful than single particles and two non - interacting particles for distinguishing non - isomorphic strongly regular graphs  @xcite .",
    "quantum walks of two identical photons revealed quantum correlations that depended critically on the input state of the quantum walk  @xcite .",
    "fundamental effects such as the emergence of correlations in two - particle quantum walks were recently reported for interacting atoms in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "the control over the interacting atoms in the regime where the dynamics is dominated by interparticle interactions made it possible to observe the frequency doubling of bloch oscillations , predicted for electron systems  @xcite and recently simulated with photons in a waveguide array  @xcite .    within the studies involving quantum dynamics under the influence of external fields ,",
    "the unidirectional transport of wavepackets promoted by superposed static and harmonic fields has been greatly explored  @xcite .",
    "a weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0 atoms in a tilted lattice potential was used to demonstrate that harmonic driving can lead to matter - wave transport over macroscopic distances  @xcite .",
    "this directed motion is promoted when the frequency of the ac field is a multiple of the frequency of the usual bloch oscillations .",
    "furthermote , the average velocity displayed by the wavepacket depends on the magnitudes of the ac and dc field components and on the initial phase of the ac field . super bloch oscillations and breathing take place with an amplitude that diverges as the resonance condition is approached  @xcite . for initially localized and uncorrelated two - particle quantum wavepackets evolving in a 1d discrete lattice",
    ", it has been reported that the particles become strongly entangled when directed by a harmonic ac field which is resonant with frequency - doubled bloch oscillations promoted by a static dc field  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical and experimental works have shown the possibility of using external fields to manipulate entangled matter - states .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a new protocol for manipulating quantum matter - states of two correlated particles in a regular one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice .",
    "more specifically , we consider two interacting particles placed in a linear discrete lattice under the effect of a gaussian time - dependent electric field . pulsed external fields ( including gaussian - pulses ) have been used in different scientific contexts  @xcite , making the experimental implementation feasible . in the framework of the tight - binding hubbard model hamiltonian with on - site inter - particle interaction , we will follow the time evolution of wavepackets and compute typical physical quantities to characterize the wavepacket dynamics along the chain .",
    "in particular , we will show that a proper tunning of the pulsed electric field can control the migration of a pair of strongly entangled particles .",
    "our numerical results are corroborated with an analytical expression obtained using a semi - classical approach . since the external field acts in a different way on bound - pair and unbound states",
    ", we will show that the initial wavepacket splits into two branches which propagates in specific directions and drift velocities .",
    "the amplitude of each mode will be related to the degree of entanglement of the two particles , which exhibits a non - monotonic dependence on the interaction between particles .",
    "as such , we explore the possibility of controlling the direction and drift velocity of two distinct wavepacket components .",
    "the system under consideration contains two interacting particles placed in a one - dimensional discrete lattice of spacing @xmath1 under the action of an external field . in the framework of the tight - binding hubbard model , the hamiltonian can be described as @xmath2   \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\sum_n   uc^{\\dagger}_{n,1}c_{n,1}c^{\\dagger}_{n,2}c_{n,2 }   ,   \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation and creation operators for particles of charge @xmath5 at site @xmath6 with spin @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , @xmath9 is the potential at site @xmath6 and @xmath10 is the on - site hubbard interaction . a possible physical realization of the present model consists of two bosonic atoms in an optical lattice under a tilting pulse .",
    "it has been recently shown experimentaly that two interacting bosons in a tilted optical lattice  @xcite has similar features of two interacting charged particles under an external uniforme field  @xcite . here",
    ", the external field consists of a gaussian - pulse applied parallel to the chain lenght , which can be expressed as @xmath11 ,   \\label{pulse}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 controls the duration of each pulse and @xmath13 is the time of reference .",
    "for very small values of @xmath12 , @xmath14 represents a delta - like pulse at @xmath15 .",
    "pulsed external fields ( including gaussian - pulses ) have been reported in different settings such as reorientation of nematic liquid crystals  @xcite , the experimental realization of a quantum @xmath16-kicked rotor in ultracold sodium atoms trapped in a 1d potential  @xcite , analysis of the transient membrane response for cells  @xcite , deceleration and bunching of cold molecules  @xcite and wave - packet manipulation using pulses with a smooth envelope  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will consider the case @xmath17 , corresponding to hubbard repulsion . in order to follow the time evolution of wavepackets , we solved the time dependent schrdinger equation by expanding the wavefunction in the wannier representation @xmath18 where the ket @xmath19 represents a state with one particle with spin @xmath20 at site @xmath21 and the other particle with spin @xmath22 at site @xmath23 .",
    "we consider the particles distinguishable by their spin state .",
    "once the initial state is prepared as a direct product of states , the particles will always be distinguishable by their spins since the hamiltonian does not involve spin exchange interactions .",
    "the temporal evolution of the wavefunction components in the wannier representation is governed by the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath24f_{n_{1},n_{2}}(t ) , \\label{eq : estime}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the on - site energies @xmath25 were taken as the reference energy ( @xmath26 ) and we used units of @xmath27 .",
    "the above set of equations were solved numerically by using fourth order runge - kutta method with step size about @xmath28 in order to keep the wavefunction norm conservation along the entire time interval considered .",
    "we followed the time evolution of an initially gaussian wavepacket with width @xmath29 : @xmath30 where the initial positions ( @xmath31 ) were considered to be centered at ( @xmath32 ) . through the above - described approach , we computed typical quantities that can bring information about the wavepacket time - evolution , as it will be detailed below .",
    "we start following the time evolution of the wavepacket centroid associated with each particle defined as @xmath33 due to the symmetry of the initial state and interaction hamiltonian , one has that @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the centroid evolution for an initial wave - packet width @xmath35 , @xmath36 and ( a ) @xmath37 and ( b ) @xmath38 .",
    "we adjusted the value of @xmath39 in order to apply an electric pulse at time @xmath40 whose impulse @xmath41 $ ] was @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "we observe that a single pulse with impulse @xmath44 promotes the movement of the wave - packet .",
    "however , the dynamic behavior displayed by particles with interaction strength @xmath38 is clearly distinct from that provided by non - interacing particles ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "while @xmath37 shows trends consistent with the single - particle formalism ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for @xmath38 some electric pulse settings imposes a movement in the opposite direction to that observed for @xmath37 .    in order to better characterize the wavepacket dynamics , we collected the centroid after different electric pulse settings . with these data , we computed the average centroid velocity @xmath46 for each value of the field impulse .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] @xmath46 versus @xmath44 ( in @xmath47 units ) for initial wavepackets width @xmath48 and ( a ) @xmath37 , ( b ) @xmath38 and ( c ) @xmath49 .",
    "as the previous results showed , the behavior for @xmath37 ( see fig .  [ fig2]a ) recovers the single particle dynamics  @xcite . a clear understanding of the underlying physical process can be reached by using a semi - classical formalism . for a particle of charge @xmath5 , the wavevector @xmath50 after an electric pulse is @xmath51 thus , keeping in mind the energy dispersion of the single particle problem and its relationship with the group velocity of wave - packet centered around some @xmath52 state , the sine - like behavior displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a is easily recovered . by increasing of the initial wavepacket width",
    ", the dynamics converges to semiclassical prediction , with limits @xmath53 . for a narrow initial wavepacket ( @xmath35 ) and intermediate interaction strength @xmath38 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig2]b ) , @xmath54 displays a distinct dependence on the field impulse .",
    "now , besides the pure ( unbound ) states covering the range @xmath55 , there is a band of bound - pair states covering the range @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "these bound - pair states play a predominant role in the wavepacket dynamics  @xcite . by assuming a transformation to the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath57 it is possible to show ( more technical details",
    "are found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that in the absence of interaction @xmath10 we have @xmath58 here , @xmath50 is the center of mass momentum and @xmath59 is the relative momentum between particles . besides , we have in the presence of hubbard interaction @xmath60 related to the bound - pair states . with these last two expressions ,",
    "since the group velocity of a wavepacket is @xmath61 , we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants .",
    "we fitted the data in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b with the above expression ( represented by the solid line ) and achieved an excellent agreement of the numerical data with our semi - classical prediction for strongly correlated particles . with increasing of the initial wavepacket width , the unbound states components predominates , which considerably reduces the correlation between particles .",
    "while the interaction favors the coherent hopping associated with bound - pair states , the double occupancy probability decreases for wide wavepackets .",
    "this characteristics becomes clear when we observe that the impulse dependence of the average velocity gets closer of the non - interacting particles case for strong hubbard interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .    in order to exemplify the competitive character presented above it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the time evolution of the one - particle wavefunction profile in the absence of interaction ( @xmath37 ) , intermediate ( @xmath38 ) and strong particle - particle interaction ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the electric pulse was applied at @xmath40 time units , whose resulting impulse are : top panels @xmath65 and bottom panels @xmath66 . for both electric field configurations , @xmath37 shows that the entire wavepacket is driven to perform a unidirectional transport along the chain , consistent with the single - particle formalism . on the other hand , the electric pulse on the system with the interaction between particles turned on induces the splitting of the wavepacket in two wavefronts .",
    "one is associated to unbound states , while the other is governed by bound - pair states .",
    "a similar behavior was reported for correlated bosons in optical lattices in the presence of doubly modulated ac - fields  @xcite .",
    "the on - site interaction and the lattice shaking displays independent modulating frequencies , that when properly adjusted can offer a bifurcating quantum motion of pair correlated particles propagating in opposite directions .",
    "however , we show that both components ( bound - pair and unbound components ) performs an unidirectional transport , but can propagate in the opposite [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a - c ) ] as well as the same [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](d - f ) ] direction .",
    "the drift velocity of each front can be analytically determined by the semi - classical description of the impulse dependence of the centroid velocity .",
    "the previous results suggest that the connection between interaction strenght and the amplitude of the wavepacket fractions is related to competitive character between bound - pair and unbound states .",
    "this feature indicates that states are more strongly entangled in the regime of intermediate interaction strengths . in order to quantify the degree of entanglement of the two - particle wavefunction",
    ", we compute the purity function defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the reduced density matrix for particle 1 obtained after taking the partial trace over the states of particle 2  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a it is shown the purity computed after @xmath69 time units ( @xmath70 ) versus the interaction strenght ( @xmath10 ) for systems under different applied field pulses . for a pure quantum state ,",
    "the density matrix is a projector , so that the purity function @xmath71 and the two particles are not quantum entangled . as the interaction between particles",
    "is increased , an enhancement in the degree of entanglement @xmath72 is observed .",
    "however , this behavior is not monotonic . after an intermediate interaction strength ,",
    "the degree of entanglement is reduced .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior is related to the competitive character described above , where the interaction favors the coherent hopping associated with bound states while the wavepacket widening decreases the double occupancy probability .",
    "we also note that the degree of entanglement is larger for electric pulses that promote larger velocities at the unbound branch .",
    "[ fig4]b displays the time evolution of the purity function for @xmath73 and electric field impulses @xmath74 . while the two particles are not entangled for @xmath45 , for @xmath75 and @xmath76 the purity function continuously decreases in time .",
    "this feature indicates that the wavepacket develops quantum entanglement over a continuously growing chain segment . in this configuration",
    "the electric pulse promotes the largest velocity of the unbound branch .",
    "in contrast , for other settings , the degree of entanglement quickly saturates , reinforcing the fact that unbounded states plays a more significative role in the wavepacket dynamics in the regime of very strong interactions .",
    "in summary , we introduced a scheme to generate and manipulate spatially entangled two - particle states by driving them using a pulsed electric field .",
    "more specifically , our results showed that bound - pair and unbound states of an initially entanglement wavepacket can be controlled separately .",
    "this allows to split the wavepacket into two fractions that develops unidirectional transport , with speed and direction of each branch externally controlled by the pulsed field .",
    "the electric field can be adjusted in order to make these two components ( bound - pair and unbound states ) propagate either in the same or opposite directions .",
    "the amplitude of each mode is related to the degree of entanglement of the two particles , which presents a non - monotonic dependence with the interaction between particles .",
    "this behavior comes from the competitive character between bound - pair and unbound states .",
    "this competition leads to an optimal range of couplings to obtain a strongly correlated dynamics of the two interacting particles .",
    "our analysis is based on observables that can be experimentally verified , such as the wavepacket profile  @xcite and quantum purity  @xcite .",
    "thus , these recent experimental achievements strongly indicate that the scheme proposed here is feasible in systems of ultracold atoms trapped on one - dimensional optical lattices under a tilting pulse .",
    "we hope that our work may impel further investigations aiming the manipulation of entangled particles in low - dimensional systems .",
