    "is that a small amount of radiation originating outside the black hole and coming into the non static region ii ( @xmath337 ) is gravitationally blueshifted as it propagates inwards parallel to the cauchy horizon , in a way such that the energy flux measured by an observer in free fall towards ( the right copy , see figures [ rnfig ] and [ rndsfig ] ) of region i ( @xmath259 ) diverges as @xmath338 .",

    "although for some time it was thought that a positive cosmological constant introduces a competition of red and blueshifts effects that prevents this divergence in the case of nearly extremal ( @xmath343 ) black holes @xcite , it was later proved in @xcite that if we take into account the contributions of scattered outgoing modes the divergence occurs for any positive value of @xmath22 allowing for a three horizon structure .",

    "however , the @xmath303 enter the harmonic expansion of the @xmath156 pieces of @xmath6 and @xmath5 which , according to equations ( [ f ] ) , ( [ q ] ) , ( [ wfi ] ) and ( [ pfi ] ) are @xmath344,\\\\ \\label{qhart } \\mathcal{q}_{>1 } & = \\frac{q^2-mr}{r^8 } [ 2q ( r(\\j2 + 2)-(3m+\\xi ) ) \\j2 \\phi_1 + \\tfrac{1}{2 } ( r ( 3m+\\xi)-4q^2 ) \\j2 ( \\j2 + 2 ) \\phi_2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the implications of the combined set of equations ( [ hartle])-([qhart ] ) are immediate : for a radially infalling observer crossing @xmath277 , the rate @xmath345 is clearly nonzero and finite .",
    "for such an observer , @xmath346 commutes with the angular operators @xmath229 and @xmath302 .",

    "of course , this statement needs to be taken with care since as soon as @xmath277 is approached and these quantities start to grow , the linearized equations become useless an one needs to study the evolution of the perturbation using other techniques ; but in any case the divergence at @xmath277 of the linear fields is a clear indication of strong cosmic censorship . +",
    "the extreme case @xmath281 has been less studied , although it was recently shown that for @xmath268 ( case in which the extreme black holes corresponds to @xmath352 ) the transverse derivative @xmath353 in coordinates @xmath354 ( again , for a fixed @xmath81 component ) diverges at @xmath279 as @xmath355 along the horizon null generators @xcite .",
    "the divergence follows from a set quantities that are shown from the ( [ rwe ] ) to be conserved along the @xmath281 horizon generators .",

    "+ perturbations of the extreme @xmath268 case were studied non linearly in a recent paper by reiris @xcite where it was shown that small electro - vacuum perturbations of initial data of extreme reissner - nordstrm black holes can not decay in time into an extreme kerr - newman black hole .",

    "the instability , confined to this region , belongs to the even sector of the linear perturbations .",
    "we proved that the odd sector of einstein - maxwell perturbations around a ( a)ds black hole shares with the uncharged schwarzschild black hole the property that there are physically meaningful , gauge invariant scalar fields @xmath208 and @xmath222 encoding the same information as a gauge class of a metric perturbation and satisfying a system of four dimensional wave equations which are entirely equivalent to the linearized einstein - maxwell equations",
    ". for uncharged black holes @xmath357 the system of equations decouple , leaving the equation found in @xcite @xcite for the gravitational degrees of freedom , encoded in @xmath208 , and the fackerrel ipser equation for the maxwell degrees of freedom @xmath222 .",
    "+ besides the significant reduction of the linearized einstein - maxwell system to scalar field equations , the resulting system of equations allow us to prove that , for generic perturbations , @xmath208 and @xmath222 are pointwise bounded in the outer static region .",
    "this gives a strong notion of linear stability in this region , analogous to that found in @xcite and @xcite for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "+ if we assume that the large @xmath358 decay at fixed @xmath290 of solutions of the regge - wheeler equation in the @xmath357 case ( known as price tails , see @xcite , and @xcite for @xmath284 ) occurs also for the @xmath30 regge - wheeler fields @xmath303 in ( [ rwe2 ] ) , and use the 1 - 1 correspondence between odd perturbations and the set of @xmath359 s , together with equations ( [ f ] ) , ( [ q ] ) , ( [ wfi ] ) and ( [ pfi ] ) , we conclude that at large @xmath308 @xmath360 and @xmath361 which corresponds to a deformation within the kerr - newman ( kerr - newman de sitter ) family by adding a small amount of angular momentum .",

    "+ the divergence of @xmath362 and @xmath363 for free falling radial observers as they approach the cauchy horizon from region ii , proved in the previous section , supports strong cosmic censorship in its purest form , as @xmath6 is a perturbed curvature scalar .",
