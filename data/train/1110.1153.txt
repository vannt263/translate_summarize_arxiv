    "the ucac2 catalog presents its proper motions on the hipparcos system with the nominal errors of 1 to 3 mas yr@xmath2 for stars up to @xmath20 mag and about 4 to 7 mas yr@xmath2 for fainter stars up to @xmath21 mag .",
    "the systematic errors of the proper motions in the ucac2 catalog are in the range from 0.5 to 1.0 mas yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the ucac2 catalog contains 48 million objects with limiting magnitude of @xmath22 mag .",

    "@xcite presented the ppmx catalog which including positions and absolute proper motions of @xmath24 million stars with limiting magnitude @xmath25 mag in a red band .",
    "very recently , @xcite published the all - sky ucac3 catalog which containing over 100 million objects with slightly deeper limiting magnitude than that of the ucac2 catalog .",
    "the absolute proper motions in the above - mentioned catalogs can only be used in the kinematic studies of stars in the neighborhood of the sun due to their brighter limiting magnitudes of stars in those catalogs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in recent decade , a few of catalogs are available for stars with more fainter limiting magnitudes .",
    "@xcite presented the supercosmos catalog whose zero - point of the absolute proper motion system is fixed to the extragalactic reference frame .",
    "the mean error of the proper motions in this catalog changes from typically 10 mas yr@xmath2 for objects with @xmath26 mag to 50 mas yr@xmath2 for objects with @xmath27 mag .",
    "the zero - point error in the proper motions of the supercosmos catalog is less than 1 mas yr@xmath2 for objects with @xmath28 mag , and is not larger than 10 mas yr@xmath2 for objects with @xmath29 mag .",
    "the gscii catalog presents astrometry , photometry , and classification for about 946 million objects , but the proper motion data are not released to the scientific community due to the significant systematic errors in the derived proper motions for objects in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the usno - b catalog presents proper motions for about one billion objects based on data obtained from scans of 7435 schmidt plates @xcite .",
    "but the proper motions in this catalog are relative , not absolute , which limits their use in the kinematic studies of stars in the galaxy @xcite . combining the usno - b and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) catalogs , ( * ? ? ?",

    "the usno - b positions are recalibrated using the galaxies identified in the sdss catalog , and the proper motions are placed on an absolute reference frame and are recomputed using both the usno - b and sdss positions .",
    "the random proper - motion error is only @xmath30 mas yr@xmath2 for object with @xmath31 mag and @xmath32 mas yr@xmath2 for object with @xmath33 mag .",

    "@xcite presented the xpm-1.0 catalog which including absolute proper motions of about 280 millions stars covering the entire sky . the positions in the usno - a2.0 @xcite and 2mass catalogs were used to calibrate the proper motions of xpm-1.0 .",
    "the zero - point of the absolute proper motions in the xpm-1.0 catalog was linked to more than one million galaxies .",

    "the mean errors of the proper motions in ppmxl catalog change from 4 mas yr@xmath2 to more than 10 mas yr@xmath2 depending on the magnitudes .    as the largest available absolute proper motion catalog with very fainter limiting magnitude ,",
    "the ppmxl catalog is a very important resource in the kinematic studies of the galaxy . before using the proper motion data in the ppmxl catalog",
    ", it is very important to understand the systematic and random errors of the proper motions in this catalog . @xcite",
    "have corrected the plate - dependent distortions of the proper motions during the construction procedure of the ppmxl catalog .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the magnitude- and color - dependent systematic errors in the ppmxl catalog are difficult to be determined due to no independent reference on icrs at fainter magnitude . on the other hand , it is also difficult to distinguish between systematic errors and different kinematics for different populations in the galaxy .",
    "quasars are very distant extragalactic objects and their proper motions can be considered as zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the psfs of quasars in an image are close to those of the stars , the systematic deviation from zero within the proper motions of the quasars and their standard deviation represent the systematic and random errors in the proper motions of the stars . in this work ,",
    "a largest available quasars sample is used to analyze the systematic and random errors in the proper motions of the ppmxl catalog .",
    "we present the construction procedure of the ppmxl catalog in section 2 .",
    "the quasar sample identified in the ppmxl catalog is presented in section 3 . in section 4 , the systematic and random errors in the proper motions of the ppmxl catalog are derived using the quasar sample . for comparison , the systematic and random errors in the usno - sdss proper motions are derived in section 5 .",
    "our discussion and conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "first , the usno - b catalog was cross - identified with the ppmx catalog .",
    "the common stars in the ppmx catalog fainter than tycho-2 limits were used , for each field ( corresponding to a schmidt plate ) , to derive the mean deviations in right ascension @xmath38 and declination @xmath39 at the field epoch from the usno - b catalog .",
    "this step corrected the positions in the usno - b catalog to the icrs .",
    "then , the field - corrected usno - b catalog was cross - identified with the 2mass catalog . for each common star ,",
    "its positions at different epochs in the usno - b catalog and at the observational epoch of the 2mass catalog were recalculated with a least - squares method . in the least - squares adjustment procedure , individual weight for each star at different epoch is attributed .",
    "after the least - squares adjustment , a preliminary catalog with the new position and proper motion for each common star was constructed .    to link the proper motion system of the preliminary catalog to the icrs",
    ", stars in the preliminary catalog with @xmath40 between 12 and 13 mag were chosen to represent the preliminary system which called ps1 , and the ppmx catalog was chosen as the optical representation of the icrs . before linking to the ppmx catalog , the obvious plate - dependent distortions of the proper motions of the ps1 in the south of @xmath41 declination were corrected using the proper motions of the ucac3 catalog .",
    "the proper motions of the ps1 are left unchanged north of @xmath41 declination .",
    "the ucac3-corrected ps1 system is called ps2 . then , using the proper motions in the ppmx catalog , the ps2 was corrected to icrs , the resulting system is called ps3 .",
    "above - mentioned procedure only considered stars having 2mass observations . to link the proper motions of objects fainter than the 2mass limits on the icrs",
    ", the least - squares adjustment were recalculated giving weight zero to the 2mass observations . for stars in ps3 ,",
    "the differences in the proper motions with and without including 2mass observations were derived .",
    "then , these differences were used to corrected the proper motions of objects without including 2mass observations to the icrs represented by the ppmx catalog .",
    "so far , the proper motions of all objects in the ppmxl catalog are on the icrs represented by the ppmx catalog . at the final stage",
    ", ppmxl is merged with ppmx . for an object in the ppmx catalog , if there is no object matched in the ppmxl or the error of its proper motions in the ppmx is smaller than that in the ppmxl , the data in the ppmx will be added to the ppmxl or replace that in the ppmxl .",
    "the 13th edition of the catalog of quasars and active nuclei ( * ? ? ? * hereafter vv13 ) is used as the primary source for known quasars .",
    "this catalog contains 133336 quasars which includes all known quasars when this catalog was compiled .",
    "two parameters of quasars : magnitude and coordinate can be used to cross - identify the common object between the vv13 and the ppmxl catalogs . because the photometric data in these two catalogs are photographic magnitude with very large uncertainties , only the coordinates of quasars in these two catalogs were used . for a quasar listed in the vv13 catalog , if only one object is matched in the ppmxl catalog within a given search radius , then this object is considered as the same one in both two catalogs .",
    "if the search radius is too small , there is no any matched object between these two catalogs .",
    "when the search radius increases , more objects will be found within the given search radius , but no additional data can be used to distinguish the true matched one . using a similar method of @xcite used in their construction of the large quasar astrometric catalog ( lqac ) , different search radii",
    "were used to find the one and only matched quasars between the vv13 and the ppmxl catalogs .",
    "figure [ fg1 ] shows the number of matched quasars between the vv13 and the ppmxl catalogs within different search radii from 0.5 to 30 arcsec with a step of 0.5 arcsec .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fg1 ] that the number of matched quasars increases very quickly to its maximum from 0.5 arcsec to 2.5 arcsec , then this number decreases slowly along with the increased search radius . using the search radius of 2.5 arcsec ,",
    "117053 quasars are matched and are taken as the members of our quasar sample .",
    "for the matched quasars , their data in the ppmxl catalog were extracted using the catalog access tool vizier .",
    "figure [ fg2 ] shows the spatial distribution of the 117053 quasars in our sample .",
    "the distribution of quasars is very non - uniform , most of quasars are located at the limited regions and are spectroscopically confirmed with the observations of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite . with a search radius of 1 arcsec and using the catalog access tool vizier , the coordinates of quasars listed in the ppmxl catalog were used to cross - identified with the seventh data release ( dr7 ) of sdss @xcite , 97150 quasars in our sample were identified in the sdss dr7 catalog .",

    "figure [ fg3 ] indicates that our present quasar sample represents the objects with fainter magnitudes in the ppmxl catalog . in our quasar sample ,",
    "only 13520 quasars have the observation data from the 2mass catalog .",
    "thus , most of the proper motions of quasars in our sample were derived only from the photographic data .",
    "figure [ fg4 ] shows that most of quasars in our sample are within the range of @xmath44 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 and of sdss @xmath6 between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ fg4 ] also indicates that our present quasar sample only represents the objects in the ppmxl catalog within the limited color range .",
    "we have assumed that a quasar s distance is very far that its proper motion can not be detected by present astrometric observation in the optical band and can be considered as zero .",
    "thus , for a sample of quasars , any deviation from zero of the mean of the proper motions of the sample can be considered as the systematic error of the proper motions , and the dispersion of the proper motions from the mean can be considered as the random error of the proper motions of the sample .",
