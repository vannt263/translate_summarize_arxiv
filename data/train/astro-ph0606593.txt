    "the emergence of biomolecular homochirality in prebiotic earth is a crucial step in the early history of life @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that chiral selectivity plays a key role in the biochemistry of living systems : amino acids in proteins are left - handed while sugars are right - handed .",
    "however , laboratory syntheses produce racemic results .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , given that statistical fluctuations of reactants will invariably bias one enantiometer over the other @xcite : even though every synthesis is _ ab initio _ asymmetric @xcite , the enantiometric excess is nevertheless erased as the reactions unfold .",
    "an important exception is the reaction by soai and coworkers , where a small initial enantiometric excess is effectively amplified in the autocatalytic alkylation of pyrimidyl aldehydes with dialkylzincs @xcite .",
    "as stressed by blackmond @xcite , soai s reaction succeeds because it features the needed autocatalytic behavior proposed originally by frank @xcite with enantiometric cross - inhibition catalysed by dimers .",
    "it is unlikely that the specific chemistry of the soai reaction occurred in early - earth .",
    "however , it displays the relevant signatures of a realistic homochirality - inducing reaction network : autocatalysis , enantiometric cross - inhibition , and enzymatic enhancement performed by dimers or by larger chirally - pure chains . in the present work",
    ", we will investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of a reaction network recently proposed by sandars which shares these features @xcite .",
    "to it , we will add an explicit chiral bias , in order to investigate the efficacy of intrinsic and extrinsic biasing mechanisms proposed in the literature . a first step in this direction",
    "can be found in the work by brandenburg _",
    "et al . _ , who studied an extension of sandar s model including bias but no spatial dependence @xcite . by intrinsic we mean either biasing effects related to fundamental physics , such as parity - violating weak neutral currents ( wnc ) @xcite or  given that we know little of early - earth s prebiotic chemistry and even less of other possible life - bearing planetary platforms @xcite  to some as yet unknown chemical process . by extrinsic we mean possible environmental influences , such as circularly - polarized uv light ( cpl ) from , for example , active star - formation regions @xcite or direct seeding of chiral compounds by meteoritic bombardment @xcite .",
    "the spatiotemporal dynamics of the reaction network will be shown to be equivalent to a two - phase system undergoing a symmetry - breaking phase transition characterized by the formation of competing domains of opposite chirality .",
    "the evolution of the domain network is sensitive to earth s early environmental history and to the magnitude of the chiral bias . using the time - scale associated with the emergence of life on earth it is possible to obtain a lower bound on the bias .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that the very small bias from wnc is inefficient to generate homochiral conditions . for cpl",
    "the situation is less clear due to uncertainty in the nature and duration of sources , but still highly unlikely .",
    "the formalism is set up to be applicable to any planetary platform .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the biased polymerization model and its pertinent rate equations . in section 3",
    "we describe the reduced ( @xmath0 ) model and how the net chirality can be interpreted as a continuous order parameter satisfying an effective potential .",
    "this allows us to introduce explicitly spatial dependence in the study of biased polymerization . in section 4",
    "we describe the dynamics of homochirality using techniques from the theory of phase transitions with mean - field ginzburg - landau models in the limit of no bias . in section 5",
    "we generalize our results to include a small bias , describing in detail the wall dynamics in this case and the time - scales associated with the development of homochirality in early - earth .",
    "we also investigate if the onset of prebiotic homochirality on early - earth could have been the result of a nucleation event.we conclude in section 6 with a summary of our results and an outlook to future work .",
    "sandar s model describes how long chains of homochiral polymers may evolve from a gradual build up of chiral monomers @xcite . in order to reach homochirality two processes",
    "are needed : reactions must be autocatalytic so that longer , chirally - pure chains may be synthesized .",
    "in addition , a mechanism for chiral amplification is also needed .",
    "this amplification may be achieved in a number of ways @xcite .",
    "sandars included both enantiometric cross - inhibition and an enzymatic enhancement catalysed by the longest chain in the reactor pool .",
    "consider a polymer with @xmath1 left - handed monomers , @xmath2 .",
    "it may grow by aggregating a left - handed monomer @xmath3 or it may instead be inhibited by the addition of a right - handed monomer @xmath4 to either of its ends . writing the reaction rates as @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", the reaction network can be written as @xcite : @xmath7 supplemented by the four opposite reactions for right - handed polymers by interchanging @xmath8 .",
    "the network includes a substrate @xmath9 from where both left and right - handed monomers are generated .",
    "the rate at which monomers are generated may depend on several factors .",
    "it may be due to already existing polymers with an enzymatic enhancement denoted here by @xmath10 for left(right)-handed monomers .",
    "sandars wrote @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the largest polymer in the substrate . if @xmath14 , the case we investigate here , we can model the catalytic role of dimers @xcite .",
    "wattis and coveney @xcite proposed instead @xmath15 and @xmath16 , while brandenburg _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested a weighted sum , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "motivated by mathematical simplicity and by soai s reactions , we will follow sandars .",
    "another factor that may influence the production rate of monomers is an explicit bias towards a specific handedness .",
    "we assign a chiral - specific reaction rate @xmath19 such that the generation of left and right - handed monomers from the substrate @xmath9 is written as @xmath20 the reaction rates are related to the equilibrium population of each handedness as @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath24 is the temperature , and @xmath25 denotes the energy difference between the two enantiometers , here chosen arbitrarily to suppress the right - handed monomers . note that similar results would have been obtained by considering @xmath26 to be the activation energy for forming @xmath27 molecules , and @xmath25 the difference in activation energy between enantiometers .",

    "as has been thoroughly discussed in the literature @xcite , the dynamical system defined by the polymerization equations for a given value of @xmath13 shows a bifurcation behavior at a certain critical value of @xmath38 , @xmath44 .",

    "the factors of @xmath57 on the rhs reflect that monomers may attach to either end of the chain . for @xmath0 , however , one must discount this for the interaction of 2 single monomers .",
    "previous authors @xcite have explored the evolution of the reaction network for different values of @xmath13 . here , we are interested in investigating not only the temporal evolution of the various concentrations ( @xmath58,~[r_n]$ ] ) but also their spatial behavior in the presence of bias .",
    "we are motivated by interesting work by saito and huyga @xcite , who investigated spatial proliferation of left and right - handed polymers in the context of equilibrium monte - carlo methods and , in particular , by that of brandenburg and multamki @xcite ( henceforth bm ) , where the spatiotemporal evolution of left and right - handed reaction networks was investigated in the absence of chiral bias .      as remarked by gayathri and rao @xcite ,",
    "taking the concentrations to be functions of position implies that the number of molecules per unit volume is assumed to be large enough so that the concentrations vary smoothly with space and time . in other words ,",
    "the concentrations are defined in a coarse - grained volume which , of course , must be larger than the smallest relevant distance - scale ( @xmath59 ) , to be derived below .",
    "the chemical mixture is then defined in block - volumes which are multiples of @xmath60 .",
    "this is essentially the procedure adopted in studying mean - field models of phase transitions in the ising universality class as , for example , in ferromagnetic phase transitions , where the order parameter is the coarse - grained magnetization over a block of spins @xcite",
    ". indeed , in a recent work @xcite gleiser and thorarinson ( gt ) demonstrated that chiral symmetry breaking in the context of the continuous model of bm can be understood in terms of a second - order phase transition with a critical `` temperature '' determined by the strength of the coupling between the reaction network and the external environment .",
    "one can not speak consistently of symmetry breaking without including spatial dependence .    adding spatial dependence to the reaction network",
    "greatly complicates its study , as we must investigate coupled pdes as opposed to odes .",
    "fortunately , as remarked by bm , it is possible to truncate the system to @xmath14 and still capture its essential behavior , the dynamics leading ( or not ) to homochirality within a large volume @xmath61 . given the catalytic role of dimers in the soai reaction @xcite we will investigate the biased spatiotemporal dynamics of reaction networks with @xmath14 .",
    "the great practical advantage of the truncation is that it elegantly reduces the system to an effective scalar field theory , where the field ",
    "the order parameter  determines the net chirality in a given volume @xcite .",

    "domains of opposite chirality , separated by thin interfaces , compete for dominance .",
    "it was shown that the dynamics of the domain network is determined by the percolation properties of its initial distribution and subsequently by the two main forces acting on the interfaces , surface tension and chiral bias .",
    "small biases of @xmath221 were shown to be inefficient to drive reasonably - sized reactor pools toward homochirality within presently - accepted time - scales for the origin of life on earth . as a consequence , the present calculations indicate that wncs can not explain the observed homochirality of life s biomolecules .",
    "cpl remains a remote possibility , albeit current sources do not look promising either in magnitude and duration .",
    "also , it should be noted that unpolarized uv may destroy any early enantiometric excess .",
    "the results obtained assume that the polymerization dynamics can be captured by truncating the reaction network to @xmath258 and that the dynamics of dimers is enslaved by that of monomers ( the adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "these approximations imply that complete chiral separation can only occur with perfect fidelity @xmath89 . going beyond involves solving the complete network of spatiotemporal rate equations for larger values of @xmath1 and for varying fidelity , a computer - intensive , but not impossible , task .",
    "however , given that the formation rate of higher @xmath1 polymers will necessarily be slower , we believe that the results obtained here capture at least qualitatively the essentials of the more general case . it remains a challenging open question whether a simple transformation could be found to reduce the biased higher-@xmath1 system to an effective field theory as done here for @xmath0 .",
    "what other possible sources of bias could have driven earth s prebiotic chemistry toward homochirality ?",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that some unknown chemical bias satisfying the above bound might have been active .",
    "another , highly unnatractive , possibility is that an unlikely large statistical fluctuation towards one enantiometer did occur and established the correct initial conditions .",
    "possible bombardment from meteors contaminated with chiral compounds could also have jump - started the process , although one still needs to explain how the chiral excess formed in the meteors in the first place .",
    "it seems to us that the answer to this enigma will be found in the coupling of the reaction network to the environment .",
    "we note again that the results obtained here are within the diffusive , and hence `` gentle , '' evolution towards homochirality .",
    "early - earth , however , was a dramatic environment .",
    "given the nonlinear properties of the spatiotemporal equations describing the evolution towards homochirality , environmental disturbances , such as meteoritic impacts or volcanic eruptions , must have played a key role in early - earth s prebiotic chemistry .",
    "these disturbances , if violent enough , would certainly affect the evolution of the chiral domain network and possibly change the bounds obtained in the present work .",
    "gleiser and thorarinson proposed to model the coupling to an external disturbance stochastically @xcite . within their framework",
    ", results will depend on how the amplitude of the external `` noise '' compares with the critical value described in section 4.1 .",
    "preliminary results indicate that large enough noises ( modelling external influences ) may redirect the direction of homochirality entirely , erasing any previous evolution toward either handedness",
    ". further work along these lines is underway . in a different approach ,",
    "brandenburg and multamki suggested that hydrodynamic turbulence could have sped up the march toward homochirality @xcite . in either case , it is clear that the evolution toward homochirality , as that of life itself , can not be separated from earth s early environmental history ."
