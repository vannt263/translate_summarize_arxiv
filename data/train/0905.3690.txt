    "brain like any computational device ( landauer 1961 ; bennett , 1982 ) or biological organ ( rolfe and brown , 1997 ) dissipates energy ( siesjo , 1978 ; ames , 2000 ; clarke and sokoloff , 1994 ) .",
    "recent studies on cerebral metabolism indicate that brain is energy expensive ( aiello and wheeler , 1995 ; attwell and laughlin , 2001 ; lennie , 2003 ) , as it consumes relatively more energy than most other organs , and its total metabolic rate has larger scaling exponent than whole body metabolic rate ( karbowski , 2007 ) .",
    "potential thermal imbalance between heat produced and removed could lead to overheating and aberrant functioning , because neural properties are strongly temperature dependent ( koch , 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the problem of heat transfer could be a serious factor shaping brain evolution ( falk , 1990 ) , organization , and function ( baker , 1982 ; raichle , 2003 ; kiyatkin , 2007 ) .",
    "consequently , what is the relationship between brain temperature , its size , cerebral power generated and neural activity ? can we estimate changes in firing rates based on changes in temperature ?",
    "is there any thermodynamic limit on brain size ?",
    "if so , does 5 kg , which is the mass of the largest mammalian brain ( haug , 1987 ; purves , 1988 ) , approach that limit ?",
    "are neural sizes and fibers also constrained by thermodynamics , and if so to what extent ? how fast can neural computation be to maintain thermal balance and physiological range of intracellular ionic concentrations ?",
    "this article answers these questions by finding the power generated by sodium metabolic pumps and relating this power to the thermal and neuroanatomical properties of brain tissue . from this",
    ", we determine theoretical thermal bounds on fiber dimensions , and compare them with empirical data .",
    "these bounds enable us to estimate the upper theoretical limits on the density of brain wiring .",

    "it should be kept in mind , however , that sodium fluctuations around [ na]@xmath193 do grow with decrease in fiber diameter ( fig .",

    "enhanced intracellular sodium fluctuations can effectively reduce the concentration gradients across neuron s membrane to values close to zero , and this would have a devastating effect on neuron s functionality if high firing rates were maintained for a prolonged period of time .",

    "the fact that the deep brain temperature depends weakly on brain volume ( table 2 ) , implies that brain size is not a major determinant of thermal responses .",
    "this in turn implies that the thermodynamics of heat balance does not restrict the brain size in any significant way , suggesting that , in principle , brains could be heavier than 5 kg ( the largest known brain ) .",
    "the interesting result is that the power generated by the sodium pump depends biphasically on neural frequency of firing , and inversely on the effective fiber diameter ( fig .",

    "the standard explanation for the decrease of @xmath245 upon stimulation requires that cerebral blood flow must increase more than @xmath115 increases ( yablonskiy et al , 2000 ) .",
    "the biphasic relationship between temperature and frequency , obtained in this paper ( fig .",

    "these values can be translated to the corresponding thermal bounds on axon diameter @xmath88 , which are in the range @xmath289 @xmath100 m ( assuming that the dendrite diameter @xmath105 @xmath100 m and it does not change ) .",
    "the average value of cortical axon diameter is @xmath99 @xmath100 m , and thus it is 12 - 1500 times larger than these limits , therefore , on average , mammalian brains operate in the safe thermal zone .",
    "however , it should be also kept in mind that axon diameter displays some variability , and the thinnest axons can reach 0.1 @xmath100 m ( faisal et al , 2005 ) .",
    "this value is still about 4 times larger than the maximal value of the lower thermal limit on @xmath88 ( which is 0.026 @xmath100 m ) , suggesting that thermal limits are not an immediate constraint on fiber size .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the estimated maximal lower thermal bound on the diameter of brain axonal wiring ( @xmath290 @xmath100 m ) is smaller than corresponding bounds imposed by structural constraints and noise , which are respectively @xmath291 @xmath100 m and @xmath292 @xmath100 m ( faisal et al , 2005 ) .",
    "the theoretical bound on axon diameter implies a corresponding lower bound on the speed of signal propagation in the gray matter .",
    "let us estimate the upper limit on temporal delays",
    ". for unmyelinated fibers ( prevalent in gray matter ) velocity of signal propagation is proportional to the square root of the fiber diameter ( hodgkin , 1954 ) .",
    "experimentally , for axons with @xmath293 @xmath100 m the propagation velocity is 2.3 mm / msec ( koch , 1998 ) , which implies that for axons with the boundary thickness of @xmath290 @xmath100 m , we have velocities 0.37 mm / msec .",
    "this gives for the maximal known extent of axons in the gray matter of 9 - 10 mm ( for macaque monkey visual cortex ; amir et al , ( 1993 ) ) the upper limit on delays in the range 24 - 27 msec .",
    "thus , apparently , thermodynamics of heat balance in the gray matter does not tolerate temporal axonal delays longer than @xmath212 0.03 sec , which is a stringent constraint .",
    "the problem of finding bounds on fiber dimensions is similar in spirit to the approaches of `` wire minimization '' in the brain ( cherniak 1995 ; murre and sturdy 1995 ; karbowski 2001 , 2003 ; chklovskii et al , 2002 ) . it is hypothesized that this principle governs the organization of the mammalian nervous system at different scales ( murre and sturdy 1995 ; prothero , 1997 ; kaas 2000 ; karbowski 2001 , 2003 ) , because it offers energy savings associated with ionic membrane transport , as well as reduction in temporal delays in neural communication",
    "the heat balance limits on fiber diameter , found in this paper , suggest corresponding upper thermal bounds on the density of wire packing in the brain in the range @xmath294 fibers per @xmath100 m .",
    "these thermal bounds on wire density are a factor of 2 - 4 higher than the corresponding upper bounds coming from structural and noise considerations ( faisal , 2005 ) .",
    "the estimated firing rates in mammals are in the range from 1.7 hz for human to 6.2 hz for mouse , and they scale systematically with brain size , with the exponent @xmath213 ( fig .",
    "the estimate for rat ( 5 hz ) is very close to that assumed by attwell and laughlin ( 2001 ) , i.e. 4 hz , which was based on weighted average of values observed experimentally .",
    "also the estimate for cat ( 4.5 hz ) is reasonably close to that reported experimentally for visual cortex ( 2.5 - 4.0 hz ; see baddeley et al , 1997 ) .",
    "however , _ in vivo _ values of firing rates are stimulus dependent and in many species are largely unknown .",
    "the scaling result of firing rates is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data on avian brains , which show an allometric decay of firing rates in the peripheral nervous system with brain / body mass ( hempleman et al , 2005 ) .",
    "it is also consistent with a prediction coming from a recent analysis of empirical data on brain metabolic scaling in mammals ( karbowski , 2007 ) , where it was suggested that an average firing rate should decrease for bigger brains to account for a negative allometric exponent of specific metabolic rate , which was also @xmath213 .",
    "this conclusion is analogous to the general trend in mammals , in which physiological processes tend to slow down with an increase in body size ( schmidt - nielsen 1984 ) .",
    "the estimate of the heat generated in the gray matter may have some margins of error .",
    "first , the assumption of the equipotential neuron is only an approximation , because it does not include explicitly the spatio - temporal effects associated with action potential propagation and back - propagation .",
    "however , it is estimated in appendix a that the correction from this effect is rather small of the order of 16@xmath177 , i.e. , the actual na@xmath0 influx can be larger by this amount .",
    "second , because the efficiency of the pump is a little less than 100@xmath177 ( @xmath224 @xmath177 ; sec .",
    "3.5 ) , the actual heat dissipated in the gray matter may be larger than @xmath115 by @xmath295 @xmath177 .",
    "therefore the total error from these two effects on the cerebral heat can theoretically reach 43@xmath177 .",
    "we should also remember that some heat coming from the glucose to atp conversion was neglected ( i.e. , it is assumed that glycolysis is 100@xmath177 efficient ) . however , the comparison of the heat estimates for the human gray matter indicates that in fact the total heat error can not be larger that 30@xmath177 ( sec .",
    "there are also other sources of error that affect the temperature distribution in the brain , such as the neglect of cooling by scalp perspiration , and variability of environmental @xmath147 temperature , which can affect convection / conduction and radiation cooling rates . however , these contributions should not have any dramatic influence on the thermal properties of brain tissue .",
    "moreover , neither of these sources of error or their combination seem to affect the main conclusion of this paper , namely , that neural anatomy ( fiber diameter and its length ) does not approach its thermodynamic limits .",
    "to reach these limits the ratio of the maximal sodium pump current to the cerebral blood flow would have to be at least 10 - 100 times larger .",
    "the formulas ( eqs .",
    "17 - 21 ) in this paper for the cmr@xmath206 , power dissipated in the gray matter , and brain temperature , may have practical use .",
    "these formulas as well as their possible future extensions can be used for assessing neural activity ( firing rates ) based on changes in temperature , cmr@xmath206 , and cbf . moreover , because this study offers a direct relationship between neural activity and neuroanatomical parameters , it may be useful in quantitative studies of the interplay between brain development , evolution , and metabolism ( purves , 1988 ; striedter , 2005 ) .",
    "the duration of a typical action potential can be divided into two phases ( fig .",
    "2a ) . during the first phase na@xmath0 conductance @xmath7 rises almost instantenously to its maximal value @xmath23 and voltage @xmath2 increases to its peak value @xmath5 .",
    "the second phase is characterized by decline in values of @xmath7 ( to zero ) and @xmath2 ( to values @xmath296 ) .",
    "the total na@xmath0 influx during an action potential is @xmath168_{o}= \\delta[\\mbox{na}]_{o}^{(1 ) }   + \\delta[\\mbox{na}]_{o}^{(2)}$ ] , where superscripts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) refer to the first and second phase , respectively .    during the first phase , the intracellular potassium concentration practically does not change , because k@xmath0 channels are activated with a delay .",
    "thus , by straightforward integration of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we obtain the na@xmath0 influx during this phase as :        sodium influx during the second phase can be computed from the sodium dynamics of eq .",
    "most of the time during this phase , the term proportional to @xmath7 is much larger than the remaining two terms in eq .",
    "thus , we can write       + where @xmath161 is the duration of the second phase and @xmath162 msec ( from simulations ) . to simplify calculations , it is assumed that na@xmath0 conductance and voltage depend on time in the following way : @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "these forms assure that for @xmath299 , we have @xmath300 and @xmath301 , and for @xmath302 we have @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "the latter value comes from simulations . after performing integral in eq .",
    "( 25 ) we obtain :        it is also interesting to check the magnitude of correction coming from the fact that real neurons are not equipotential and action potentials propagate and back - propagate with a finite velocity .",
    "let @xmath306 be the spatial constant characterizing membrane potential homogeneity , and @xmath307 the velocity of action potential propagation ( along axon ) and back - propagation ( along dendrites ) .",
    "a simple way to account for the spatio - temporal dependence of na@xmath0 conductance and voltage in eq . ( 25 ) is to make the following rescalings :          where the factor @xmath310 denotes a traveling wave of excitation along axon or dendrite with the spatial spread @xmath306 , and the function @xmath311 is the standard heaviside function equal to 1 for @xmath312 and equal to 0 for @xmath313 .",
    "these rescalings assure that points along axon and dendrite separated by @xmath314 from the soma ( action potential initiation zone ) receive an excitation after the delay time @xmath315 . with these modifications ,",
    "after some algebra , the corrected result for the @xmath168_{o}^{(2)}$ ] is       + where @xmath316 is given by @xmath317 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath318 represents the first order correction and it is clear that the equipotential approximation corresponds to the case when @xmath319 or @xmath320 . for physiological values of parameters : @xmath321 mv , @xmath166 mv , @xmath322 mm / msec , @xmath323 mm ( koch , 1998 ) , with @xmath324 msec and @xmath305 , we obtain @xmath325 .",
    "this implies that the equipotential assumption slightly underestimates the sodium influx during the second phase of sodium activation .",
    "overall , this correction to the total na@xmath0 influx @xmath168_{o}$ ] is small , @xmath326 , for low firing rates for which @xmath327 , and it gets even smaller for high firing rates .",
    "a detailed numerical treatment of the influence of action potential velocity on metabolic rate of the squid giant axon is presented in ( crotty et al , 2006 ) .      in this appendix",
    "the relaxation process of voltage and sodium to their equilibrium values is analyzed following a single action potential for a neuron that prior to that has been at rest for a long time .",
    "computations below are performed in a very late phase of an action potential when the conductances @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the voltage @xmath2 returned essentially to their resting values ( or are close to them , i.e. @xmath328 ) . during this phase",
    "we can use a linear approximation on @xmath2 and [ na ] in eq .",
    "that is , we can expand @xmath2 and @xmath329 $ ] around their resting values @xmath75 and @xmath121_{o}$ ] as : @xmath330 , @xmath121\\approx [ \\mbox{na}]_{o } + \\delta[\\mbox{na}]$ ] , where @xmath168/[\\mbox{na}]_{o } \\ll 1 $ ] , and neglect higher order terms . in this approximation",
    "the pump current @xmath13 can be written as @xmath331 $ ] , where @xmath332^{k}_{o}/([\\mbox{na}]^{k}_{o } + \\theta^{k})$ ] , and @xmath333^{k-1}_{o}/(\\theta^{k}+[\\mbox{na}]^{k}_{o})^{2}$ ] .",

    "next , using the facts that @xmath336 and @xmath337 , we can solve eq .",
    "( 6 ) analytically .",

    "this implies that changes in @xmath5 and @xmath6 due to sodium influx for an isolated action potential are very small .",
    "this leads to a simple exponential decay of @xmath168 $ ] as @xmath168\\approx \\delta[\\mbox{na}]_{o } e^{-t/\\tau}$ ] with the time constant @xmath342 , where @xmath168_{o}$ ] is na@xmath0 influx during the action potential given by eq .",
