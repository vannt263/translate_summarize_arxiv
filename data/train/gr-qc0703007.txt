    "the general theory of relativity ( gr ) constitutes one of the major scientific achievements of the past hundred years .",
    "its theoretical framework establishes that the gravitational field and the geometry of the spacetime are the same physical entity and that the equations ruling the gravitational dynamics are field equations of the spacetime geometry .",
    "gr has so far passed extremely well all experimental tests@xcite , in opposition to other relativistic extensions as scalar - tensor theories .",
    "basically , gr establishes a system of ten nonlinear , coupled partial differential equations that governs the dynamics of the gravitational field represented by the symmetric second order metric tensor @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the nonlinear nature of the field equations is the main obstacle to obtain exact solutions of the field equations , unless we make appeal to symmetries in the solutions , or alternatively the use of perturbative approaches are adopted .",
    "therefore , in order to study the dynamics of the gravitational field in more general situations the use of numerical techniques seems to be the only possible strategy to circumvent the difficulty posed by the nonlinearities of the field equations . in this context numerical relativity",
    "has become a very fertile and at the same time challenging field of research as recently considered in several interesting reviews@xcite . there",
    "the improvement of specific numerical techniques adapted to relativistic problems , along with the increase of computational resources figure as promising factors for the advance of numerical relativity .",
    "nonetheless , despite all the progress made so far the complete understanding of important problems in relativistic astrophysics such as non - spherical collapse and nonlinear regimes of emission of gravitational waves is still not complete .    a promising approach to treat numerically nonlinear problems is provided by the so - called spectral methods@xcite .",
    "the spectral methods adopt a distinct strategy if compared with the finite difference scheme .",
    "for instance , considering a function @xmath2 satisfying a given one dimensional partial differential equation , it will be approximate as a series of the type @xmath3 , where the basis or trial functions @xmath4 are known analytical polynomials such as fourier , legendre , chebyshev , etc . in general , by increasing the truncation order @xmath5 , @xmath6 approaches of the exact solution of the problem in the mean .",
    "there are distinct types of spectral methods among which we list the galerkin method@xcite , the collocation method@xcite and the tau - method .",
    "these methods have an attractive feature which is to transform any partial differential equation into a finite set of coupled ordinary differential equations , or simply a dynamical system whose dimension is dictated by the truncation order @xmath5 .",
    "another important and robust feature is the high accuracy achieved with a small truncation order , what corresponds to use moderate or low computational resources .    in this paper",
    "our objective is to present a consistent low dimensional dynamical system approach provided by the galerkin method applied to the problem of non - spherical collapse with the emission of gravitational waves , in the realm of robinson - trautman geometries@xcite . in this way",
    ", the paper is divided as follows .",
    "the basic equations that govern the dynamics of robinson - trautman spacetimes are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss and implement efficiently the galerkin method . in section 4",
    "numerical experiments are performed in order to test the efficiency and convergence of the method .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the conclusions and final remarks .",
    "@xmath7    robinson - trautman ( rt ) spacetimes are the simplest axisymmetric spacetimes that can be viewed as the exterior geometry of an isolated source emitting gravitational waves@xcite or the exterior of a distorted black hole . in a suitable coordinate system the line element for rt geometries is expressed as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a constant related to the total mass of the system and dot means derivative with respect to @xmath10 . according to einstein field equations",
    "the function @xmath11 is related to @xmath12 by the constraint equation    @xmath13    where the subscript @xmath14 denotes derivative with respect to the angle @xmath14 .",
    "the remaining vacuum einstein equations impose that the function @xmath15 satisfies the evolution equation    @xmath16    which henceforth will be denoted as the robinson - trautman ( rt ) equation .",
    "this equation governs the evolution of the gravitational field , in other words , it allows to evolve the initial data @xmath17 prescribed on a given null surface @xmath18 ( except in the case @xmath19 ) . despite its relatively simple form no general exact non - stationary solution of rt equation is known .",
    "however by restricting to stationary configurations two important solutions are known .",
    "the first is the schwarzschild solution that represents the gravitational field a black hole characterized by @xmath20 , which implies @xmath21 with a corresponding schwarzschild mass @xmath22 .",
    "the second solution represents a boosted black hole@xcite along the axis of symmetry such that    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is a parameter associated with the velocity of the boost , @xmath25 . the constraint equation ( [ eq2 ] ) in this case yields @xmath26 .",
    "it will be useful to express @xmath27 as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a constant , and for convenience we have introduced the variable @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the first step to apply the galerkin method is to express @xmath32 as a power series with respect to a suitable set of basis functions chosen as the legendre polynomials due to the symmetry of the problem and the required regularity of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34 . in this way",
    "an approximated expression for @xmath32 is established and given by    @xmath35    where @xmath5 is the truncation order , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the modal coefficients and the legendre polynomials of kth order .",
    "this basis functions define an abstract projection space for which an internal product can be defined , in this case , as    @xmath38    the next step is to substitute the galerkin decomposition for @xmath32 into eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) to obtain an approximated expression for @xmath39 , or    @xmath40    the so called residual equation follows after introducing the approximated expressions for @xmath32 and @xmath39 given above into the rt equation ( [ eq3 ] ) . after some direct calculation",
    "we obtain schematically    @xmath41^{\\prime } , % \\ ] \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where prime stands for derivative with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "in fact the residual equation can be a good measure of the error of truncation and a valuable test@xcite for the convergence of the galerkin decomposition . according to the traditional galerkin method the projection of the residual equation into each basis function @xmath42 , @xmath43",
    "is assumed to be zero in order to minimizing the error of truncation , or @xmath44 , rendering the following dynamical system for the modal coefficients    @xmath45^{\\prime } p_n(x)\\,d x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath46 .    here",
    "some remarks are necessary . in order to express the rhs of the above equation in terms of the modal coefficients ,",
    "it is necessary to integrate a large expression involving an exponential of a series of legendre functions , the size of which depends on the truncation order @xmath5 .",
    "this integration must be necessarily done symbolically ( in maple or mathematica ) , but unless @xmath47 - a very low truncation order - such an integration can not be performed .",
    "thus , we can adopt two distinct strategies based on further approximation schemes :    * the first is to assume + @xmath48 + which renders a polynomial expression for the exponential . introducing this expression into eq ( [ eq9 ] )",
    "the integration can be done promptly without much cost of cpu time for reasonable choices of @xmath5 and @xmath49 . as a matter of fact",
    ", this additional approximation can be acceptable for not large values of @xmath50 as we are going to see later . *",
    "the second strategy consists , on the hand , in applying the collocation method@xcite to express @xmath51 as a series of another basis functions , or + @xmath52 + where @xmath53 are the chebyshev polynomials , and @xmath54 the new modal coefficients given as functions of the original coefficients @xmath55 .",
    "these relations are fixed by the fact that at the collocation points @xmath56 , @xmath57 the above decomposition agrees with the exact expression , or + @xmath58 + and together with the discrete orthogonality relation @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for @xmath62 . as a consequence",
    "each modal coefficient @xmath63 can be expressed in terms of @xmath64 . in both schemes a @xmath65 dimensional dynamical system for the modal coefficients",
    "is obtained after integrating the @xmath66 of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "our first numerical task will be to study the accuracy and convergence of the approximative schemes outlined at the end of the last section .",
    "to this end we consider the exact expressions for some initial data @xmath67 identified as an oblate spheroid and a black hole in motion given , respectively , by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 and @xmath24 are constants and @xmath70 is the eccentricity . as a further assumption the eccentricity can depend on @xmath34 as @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , @xmath73 being parameters , in order to encompass the usual oblate spheroid ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and a deformed oblate spheroid ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "it is worth of calling attention that no dynamics is present if the second data family is chosen , since it represents an exact stationary solution of the rt equation .",
    "according to the previous discussion we choose the truncation order @xmath5 from which the decomposition @xmath77 is established .",
    "the values of each modal coefficient @xmath78 will be determined using the standard galerkin projection procedure starting from @xmath79 that yields    @xmath80    henceforth , we set @xmath81 without loss of generality .",
    "once the modal coefficients are determined @xmath82 will be further approximated according to the schemes presented in the last section : the first is to expand the exponential as a power series of @xmath83 in the same way as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) ; the second is to expand the exponential using the collocation method . in order to provide a quantitative measure of the error between these approximations and the _ exact _ expressions for the corresponding initial data , the @xmath84 error defined by    @xmath85 ^ 2 dx } \\label{eq15}\\ ] ]",
    "will be evaluated in each case .",
    "let us consider the oblate spheroid with @xmath74 and @xmath86 .",
    "we then fix the truncation order to @xmath87 and evaluate the error @xmath84 between the exact and approximate expressions for the oblate spheroid taking into account both additional schemes as previously described . in the first we choose @xmath88 and 4 present in the expansion @xmath89 , whereas for the second scheme",
    "the expansion of @xmath90 is constructed with @xmath91 and 10 collocation points .",
    "the respective @xmath84 errors evaluated for successive values of the eccentricity @xmath70 are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "two important aspect are worth to be mentioned .",
    "as expected small eccentricities produce very small errors even for the quite modest choice @xmath92 , since these cases correspond to tiny departures from the spherically symmetric configuration described exactly by the galerkin decomposition as @xmath93 constant , @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "high eccentricities , otherwise , represent more severe deviations from the spherical configuration , producing as a consequence an increase of the error .",
    "the second aspect concerns to the fast convergence achieved using both approaches as suggested by the plots of figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "accordingly , in the first case the convergence is clear if @xmath96 , and it is necessary that the number of collocation points is greater than , or @xmath97 the most efficient decomposition is obtained if @xmath98 collocation points is selected . if @xmath99 there is not relevant improvement in the error as exemplified in fig .",
    "1(b ) . ] .",
    "despite the acceptable errors attained with a modest truncation order ( @xmath87 ) in both cases , the use of the second scheme appears to be superior because the less algebraic effort necessary to achieve the same results of the first case with @xmath100 .    in fig .",
    "2 we have evaluated the @xmath84 error for the ( deformed ) oblate spheroid with variable eccentricity @xmath101 , in which we have set @xmath102 and again @xmath103 . as it can be seem from the plots it is clear that the scheme using the collocation points is more efficient , in the sense of the need of smaller computational effort , and accurate than the first scheme . the initial data representing a black hole in motion is considered in fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath100 and @xmath104 collocation points which confirms once more the previous conclusion .    in the second group of numerical experiments",
    "we shall verify the evolution of the error associated to the constraint equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the procedure consists into rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) in the following way @xmath105^\\prime-1 = 0.\\ ] ]    here @xmath39 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , but @xmath33 will be expressed according to the schemes of approximation as outlined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "for instance , by assuming the expansion provided by the later expression we have    @xmath106    and , as a consequence , the constraint equation now reads    @xmath107^\\prime - 1 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a similar expression is obtained if the approximation expansion given by @xmath108 is assumed .",
    "in any case the resulting form of the constraint equation is evaluated at each instant after the integration of the dynamical equation for the modal coefficients . as a matter of fact , we are interested in the rms error of the constraint or    @xmath109    fig .",
    "4 shows the evolution of this error if the initial data is the oblate spheroid ( @xmath110 , @xmath74 ) for both schemes of approximation .",
    "the residual equation can provide another possible way of verifying the convergence and accuracy of the numerical method as the truncation order is increased .",
    "in fact , as demonstrated by ? ?",
    ", the rms error of residual equation is identified as the upper bound of the rms error between the approximate and exact solutions . then , in our last numerical experiment the evolution of the error    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the residual equation ( cf .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) ) considering only the second scheme of approximation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) ) based on the collocation method . in fig .",
    "5 the convergence is illustrated by graphs corresponding to several truncation orders , namely , @xmath113 , and respectively @xmath114 collocation points . as it can be seem the error decreases rapidly until reaching to the value considered zero up to our numerical precision , and the greater is the truncation order less time is necessary to attain this value .",
    "the low dynamical system approach provided by the galerkin method constitutes a valuable tool to deal with nonlinear problems as demonstrated not only here , but also in problem of turbulence of fluids@xcite .",
    "two aspects are worth of mentioning :    * the transformation of , say , a partial differential equation to a finite set of ordinary differential equations . in general",
    "the greater is the set of these equations more accurate is the approximate solution .",
    "* a reasonable accuracy can in fact be obtained with a relatively low dimensional dynamical system .    as a matter of fact we have applied the gakerkin method to a problem of gravitation , namely , the dynamics of the robinson - trautman spacetimes that represents the simplest axisymmetric geometries endowed with gravitational waves .",
    "as we have described one of the crucial steps to implement the method is to project the residual equation into each basis function , which is necessary to obtain the dynamical system .",
    "such projections are integrations in the spatial domain ( in our case angular domain ) , but due to the presence of an exponential term , @xmath115 , these integrations can not be performed as desirable .",
    "then , we have engendered two schemes to overcome this difficulty ( cf .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) ) , where the decomposition of the exponential with respect to a series of chebyshev functions using the collocation method appeared to be quite satisfactory as demonstrated by several numerical experiments . accordingly ,",
    "even for a small truncation order , say @xmath87 ( and @xmath65 collocation points ) to decompose @xmath115 , the error associated to the constraint and residual equation are acceptable .",
    "the increase of truncation error to @xmath116 - still a modest truncation order - provides a much better accuracy and fast convergence .",
