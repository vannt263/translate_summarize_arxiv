    "the three dimensional ( @xmath0 ) disordered potts model ( dpm ) is an important system , that could help in clarifying a number of open and crucial questions .",
    "the first issue that comes to the mind is the possibility of understanding the glass transition , since this is a very challenging problem . on more general grounds ,",
    "it is very interesting to try and qualify the behavior of the system when the number of states @xmath3 becomes large : here we should see the paradigm of a `` hard '' , first order like transition but , as we will discuss in the following , only sometimes this turns out to be clear ( see for example the set of large scale , very accurate numerical simulations of ref .  , dealing with a model slightly different from the one defined here ) .",
    "in such a difficult situation extensive numerical simulations are more than welcome , and the janus supercomputer  @xcite , optimized for studying spin glasses , reaches its peak performances when analyzing lattice regular systems based on variables that can take a finite , small number of values : disordered potts models fit very well these requirements . using the computational power of janus we have been able to consistently thermalize the dpm with @xmath1 and @xmath4 on @xmath0 ( simple cubic ) lattice systems with periodic boundary conditions and size up to @xmath5 .",
    "bringing these systems to thermal equilibrium becomes increasingly harder with increasing number of states : it has been impossible for us , even by using a large amount of time of janus ( that for these problems performs , as we discuss better in the following , as thousands of pc processors ) , to get a significant , unbiased number of samples thermalized , and reliable measurements of physical quantities , for @xmath6 on a @xmath7 lattice .",
    "our results lead us to the claim that the critical behavior of the dpm with a large number of states @xmath3 is very subtle , and if @xmath3 is larger than , say , @xmath8 , numerical simulations could easily give misleading hints . the numerical results that we will discuss in the following lead us to believe that the spin glass transition gets stronger with increasing number of states @xmath3 : a theoretical analysis of these results suggests that the transition could eventually become of first order for @xmath3 large enough .",
    "we do not observe , for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , any sign of the presence of a spontaneous magnetization .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the dpm on a simple cubic lattice of linear size @xmath9 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the dpm is @xmath10 where the sum is taken over all pairs of first neighboring sites . in the @xmath3-states model spins @xmath11 can take @xmath3 different values @xmath12 . in this work",
    "we analyze the @xmath1 and @xmath4 cases .",
    "the couplings @xmath13 are independent random variables taken from a bimodal probability distribution ( @xmath14 with probability @xmath15 ) . for",
    "a different definition of a disordered potts model see ref .  .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the variables of the potts model using the _ simplex _ representation , where the @xmath3 potts states are described as vectors pointing to the corners of a @xmath16 dimensional hyper - tetrahedron .",
    "the potts scalar spins @xmath11 are thus written as @xmath16-dimensional unit vectors @xmath17 satisfying the relations @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "we use this vector representation to define the observables required to investigate the critical behavior of the system . in the simplex representation",
    "we have that : @xmath22 the couplings in the simplex representation have the form @xmath23 the spin glass behavior is studied via a properly defined tensorial overlap between two _ replicas _ ( independent copies of the system characterized by the same quenched disorder variables @xmath13 ) . its fourier transform ( with wave vector @xmath24 )",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 component of the spin at site @xmath28 of the first replica in the simplex representation , @xmath29 the @xmath30 component of the spin at site @xmath28 in the second replica , and @xmath31 is the volume of the system .",
    "this spin glass order parameter is then used to define the spin glass susceptibility in fourier space . @xmath32 where @xmath33 indicates a thermal average and @xmath34 denotes the average over different realizations of the disorder ( _ samples _ in the following ) . with the above definition",
    ", @xmath35 is the usual spin glass susceptibility .",
    "we are interested in studying the value of the dimensionless correlation length @xmath36 , since at the transition temperature it does not depend on @xmath9 , and is therefore extremely helpful to estimate the critical temperature value @xmath37 : in fact one can usually simulate different lattice sizes , and look for the crossing point in the plot of the different @xmath36 values .",
    "one can derive  @xcite the value of the correlation length @xmath38 from the fourier transforms of the susceptibility with @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the minimum wave vector allowed in the lattice . with the periodic boundary conditions used in this work we have @xmath41 or any of the two vectors obtained permuting the indexes .",
    "we also study the ferromagnetic properties of the model by monitoring the usual magnetization @xmath42 and correspondingly the magnetic susceptibility @xmath43 these two observables are crucial to check the possible existence of a ferromagnetic phase , as predicted by the mean field approximation of this model  @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the dpm with @xmath8 and with @xmath4 states , on a number of lattice sizes ( @xmath44 , @xmath4 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) .",
    "all the numerical simulations have been run using a standard metropolis algorithm combined with the parallel tempering ( pt ) optimized algorithm , in order to improve performances and allow to reach thermalization despite the very large relaxation times typical of spin glass models .",
    "we define a monte carlo sweep ( mcs ) as a set of @xmath47 trial updates of lattice spins .",
    "each simulation consists on a thermalization phase , during which the system is brought to equilibrium , and a phase of equilibrium dynamics in which relevant physical observables are measured .",
    "as we require high quality random numbers , we use a 32-bit parisi - rapuano shift register  @xcite pseudo - random number generator .  , on janus , using 48 bits random numbers .",
    "we have reproduced in all cases , within statistical errors , the results obtained with the 32 bits generator . ]    in order to improve the simulation performance and to speed up thermalization we apply a step of the pt algorithm  @xcite every few mcs s of the metropolis algorithm . the pt algorithm is based on the parallel simulation of various copies of the system , that are governed by different values of temperature , and on the exchange of their temperatures according to the algorithm s rules . in practice we let the different configurations evolve independently for a few mcs , and then we attempt a temperature swap between all pairs of neighboring temperatures : the aim is to let each configuration wander in the allowed temperature range ( that goes from low @xmath48 values , smaller than @xmath37 , to high @xmath48 values , larger than @xmath37 ) , and to use the decorrelation due to the high @xmath48 part of the landscape to achieve a substantial speed up .    in order to check the time scales of the dynamical process , so as to assess the thermalization and the statistical significance of our statistical samples , we have computed a number of dynamical observables that characterize the pt dynamics .",
    "one of them is the temperature - temperature time correlation function , introduced in ref .",
    ", that we briefly recall .",
    "let @xmath49 be the inverse temperature of the system @xmath28 at time @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , where @xmath52 is the total number of systems evolving in parallel in the pt .",
    "s not uniformly distributed in order to have a pt acceptance of order 30 - 40% in the whole @xmath53-interval .",
    "in addition , we have include additional @xmath53 s in the critical region to have clearer crossing points of the correlation length .",
    "] we consider an arbitrary function of the system temperature , @xmath54 , changing sign at @xmath55 .",
    "we shall name @xmath56 . in equilibrium",
    ", system @xmath28 can be found at any of the @xmath52 with uniform probability , hence @xmath57 , for all @xmath28 and all @xmath50 .",
    "we must choose a function @xmath58 as simple as possible , such that @xmath59 .",
    "is slightly different from that of ref .  ;",
    "@xmath60 for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the ratio of the slopes @xmath64 is fixed by the condition @xmath65 .",
    "the overall normalization being irrelevant , we choose @xmath66 .",
    "] next , we can define the correlation functions @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the total simulation time . to gain statistics we consider the sum over all the systems @xmath70 notice that this correlation function measures correlations for a given copy of the system , that is characterized , during the dynamics , by different temperature values .",
    "we have characterized the correlation function @xmath71 through its integrated autocorrelation time  @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and we have used @xmath74 ( we have always used a total simulation time larger than @xmath75 or @xmath76 times @xmath77 ) .    we have studied the systems defined on the smaller lattices ( @xmath44 and @xmath4 ) on standard pcs , while for the larger lattice sizes we have used the janus computer  @xcite , an fpga - based machine specifically designed to handle simulations of spin glass models .",
    "the performance improvement offered by janus allowed us to thermalize lattices of size up to @xmath5 . while the thermalization of lattices with @xmath78 was relatively fast",
    ", the bigger lattice sizes proved to be rather difficult to equilibrate , even within janus , things getting worse as the number of potts states increases .",
    "tables  [ tab : sim_details_p5 ] and [ tab : sim_details_p6 ] summarize the details about the numerical simulations respectively for the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 case .",
    "we were able to thermalize a large number of samples for @xmath9 up to @xmath46 .",
    "the thermalization of @xmath7 is possible , but it requires a dramatically large investment in computer resources , since the time required by each sample is very large . because of that , and given the resources we could count upon , we have only been able to analyze a few samples : the results for the few samples that we have studied in this case are consistent with the ones obtained from the smaller sizes .",
    "in addition , for some samples with @xmath78 and @xmath5 , which were especially difficult to thermalize , we had to use larger numbers of mcs s : see section [ sub : thermalization ] .",
    ".details of the simulations for @xmath1 .",

    "in this note we have characterized the critical behavior of the @xmath0 dpm with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. with a reasonably large number of states .",
    "our numerical simulations have allowed us to reach some clear evidences , and to stress some difficult issues that will require further analysis .",
    "we first stress that in both cases the spin glass transition is very clear , and we have been able to obtain a reliable estimate of the critical temperature and of the critical exponents @xmath30 and @xmath87 .",
    "we have discussed what happens when @xmath3 increases ; we have found that @xmath88 increases like @xmath3 .",
    "a similar result was conjectured in ref .",
    "( for all values of @xmath3 ) analyzing high temperature series and found in mean field for @xmath89 ( although , of course , the slope is wrong ) .",
    "in addition , the behavior of @xmath30 and @xmath87 is compatible with going to the large @xmath3 limit value that characterizes a first order phase transition .",
    "in the low temperature regime we do not see any sign of a transition to a ferromagnetic regime , that would be in principle allowed by the structure of our model .",
    "we can not exclude that at very low @xmath48 values something would happen , but in all the range we can explore the system stays in the spin glass phase .",
    "a last piece of important evidence is that low temperature simulations of this model look difficult , and that they slow down severely for increasing @xmath3 . in our particular model , where the expectation of the coupling is zero , it would be impossible to study reliably a @xmath90 model with the computational resources available today .",
    "this last observations opens indeed a last point that it will be interesting to analyze in the future .",
    "when couplings have a negative expectation value the simulation of a @xmath91 model  @xcite is possibly easier than it would be in our case , and the results are very different : in that case one does not see any sign of a phase transition",
    ". analyzing how the dpm depends on the expectation value of the couplings is indeed at this point a crucial issue , since it could turn out that the reduction in frustration due to a negative net value of the couplings could completely change the critical behavior of the model .",
