    "far from the energizing regions of star formation in the milky way and other galaxies , the interstellar medium ( ism ) is still roiling with activity , and rife with structure . both the microphysical properties and turbulent activity have been increasingly well characterized by galactic and extragalactic radio observations . in particular , recent high - resolution galactic emission surveys in the 21 cm hydrogen line ( e.g. @xcite ) , combined with galactic absorption surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) , and mapping of face - on external galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , have begun to provide a wealth of thermal and kinematic information about the atomic ism component , which comprises the majority of the total ism mass in most spiral galaxies .",
    "analysis of this data promises to yield a detailed empirical description of the atomic gas , which is known to consist of both warm and cold components , and to be strongly turbulent ( e.g. @xcite ) .    as observations of the ism advance ,",
    "there is a need on the theoretical side for increasingly sophisticated ism modeling . with modern computational tools",
    ", it is possible to pursue time - dependent hydrodynamic models which incorporate many physical processes .",
    "this numerical modeling can extend established `` classical '' results for simplified systems into more realistic regimes , and test conceptual proposals for the behavior of complex systems in a rigorous fashion .",
    "the goal of detailed ism modeling , of course , is not sophistication for its own sake , but to gain understanding about how different `` elemental '' processes interact , to ascertain which among many contributing processes are most important , and to aid in interpreting and developing reliable physical diagnostics from observations .    broadly , the presence of structure in the atomic ism can be easily understood as a consequence of the bistable thermal equilibrium curve over a range of pressures , including those typical of the ism .",
    "since the temperatures of the two stable thermal equilibria differ by a factor of @xmath1 ( at fixed pressure ) , the `` classical '' expectation based on the principle of pressure equilibrium is a system of cold , dense clouds embedded in a much more diffuse warm intercloud medium @xcite . thermal instability ( ti )",
    "tends to move gas parcels at intermediate temperatures into one of the stable phases @xcite .",
    "clouds are initially expected to condense at preferred scales where conduction limits local thermal gradients .",
    "while these basic processes are certainly involved in establishing the ism s structure , the end result is a complex product of evolution and interactions with other physical processes , leaving many open questions .",
    "for example , how do the agglomerations and disruptions of cold clouds depend on the turbulence properties , and how does this affect the mass function of condensations that results ?",
    "many processes have been proposed that can produce turbulence in the ism ( see e.g. @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "traditionally , turbulence is thought to be driven primarily by supernovae @xcite ( and , to a lesser extent , expanding hii regions ) , because the total kinetic energy they are able to supply could be sufficient to offset the turbulent dissipation in the milky way s diffuse ism ( spitzer 1978 , ch .",
    "supernovae are certainly the primary source of turbulence near regions of high - mass star formation .",
    "however , it is not clear how effectively this energy can in fact be shared with the bulk of the ism , so other sources may be ( or combine to be ) of comparable importance .",
    "indeed , observations indicate that the levels of turbulence are not strongly correlated with spiral arms ( where star formation is enhanced ) , and are just as large in outer galaxies ( where overall star formation rates are low ) as in inner regions @xcite",
    ". moreover , recent 3d simulations @xcite in which turbulence is driven solely by supernovae find that velocity dispersions are significantly lower in cold gas than in warm gas , inconsistent with observations @xcite .",
    "an obvious non - stellar energy source for the ism is galactic rotation . wherever the angular velocity decreases outward and magnetic fields are present ,",
    "the powerful magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is expected to tap this rotation and drive large - amplitude ism turbulence @xcite .",
    "detailed development of mri has primarily been studied in adiabatic or isothermal gas , where turbulent velocities and alfvn speeds grow into rough equipartition at slightly subsonic levels ( e.g. @xcite hereafter hgb1 , hgb2 ) ) .",
    "adiabatic and isothermal models , however , are essentially single phase , with only small variations in density and temperature .",
    "how do turbulent saturation levels differ in a medium where there are huge variations in conditions , such that subsonic speeds with respect to the diffuse gas are highly supersonic with respect to the dense gas ?    in the real ism , dynamics must affect thermodynamics , and vice versa .",
    "the turbulent power input is significant , and both ( irreversible ) dissipative heating and ( reversible ) pdv heating and cooling can alter distributions of temperatures compared to the narrow spikes at warm and cold equilibria that would otherwise occur . in turn",
    ", thermodynamics potentially can affect loss rates of turbulence : supersonic compressions are dissipative while subsonic compressions are not , and dissipation of magnetic energy by reconnection depends on local conditions of density and temperature .",
    "cloudy structure also changes effective flow `` collision '' times , as well as field line geometry .",
    "indeed , recent observational evidence has shown that the fraction of unstable gas in the ism may be significant ; @xcite found that at high latitudes , about half the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) lies at thermally unstable temperatures between 500 - 5000 k. numerical models which include effects of star formation @xcite find both turbulence and significant fractions of unstable gas , although it is not clear how much the temperature distributions are affected by the direct heat inputs in the star formation feedback algorithms of these models .",
    "recent simulations have addressed nonlinear evolution , in 2d and 3d , of ti in the ism without `` stellar '' energy inputs @xcite , and there have also been many numerical studies , in 2d and 3d , of the mri in single - phase gas . in previous work",
    ", we performed 2d studies of ti and mri in combination ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "paper i showed that mri growth rates in a two - phase medium are comparable to those in a single - phase medium with the same @xmath9 and @xmath10 , provided that the cloud separation along field lines does not exceed half of the fastest - growing mri wavelength ( typically @xmath11 ) .",
    "although there have been suggestions that ti itself could be a significant source of turbulence , `` pure ti '' models we performed show that for pressures comparable to mean galactic values ( i.e. away from hii regions or recent supernovae ) , velocity dispersions are only a few tenths of a @xmath12 . in our 2d simulations ,",
    "the mri leads to large - amplitude velocities and magnetic fields , but as for single - phase 2d models , late time behavior is dominated by the `` channel flow ; '' quasi - steady turbulence is possible only for 3d flows .",
    "the present work constitutes the extension of paper i to 3d , in order to study the saturated state of mri in the presence of a two - phase medium .",
    "as we shall describe , we have performed a variety of simulations , with parameters covering a range of conditions characteristic of the atomic ism .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in  2 we briefly describe the numerical method , and the initializations for the various models we have performed . in ",
    "3 we present the results of our simulations in terms of the models physical structure , thermodynamic distributions , and turbulent states ( in velocities and magnetic fields ) , as well as exhibiting sample synthetic observations based on our simulated data .",
    "we summarize , discuss the astronomical implications of our results , and compare to previous work in  4 .",
    "the numerical methods utilized for the present study are essentially the same as those of paper i , but extended from 2d to 3d . for a complete description of the numerical method and tests , please see that work . here , we briefly summarize the salient points .",
    "we integrate the time - dependent equations of magnetohydrodynamics with a version of the zeus code @xcite .",
    "zeus uses a time - explicit , operator - split , finite difference method for solving the mhd equations on a staggered mesh , capturing shocks via an artificial viscosity .",
    "velocities and magnetic field vectors are face - centered , while energy and mass density are volume - centered .",
    "zeus employs the ct and moc algorithms @xcite to maintain @xmath13 and ensure accurate propagation of alfvn waves .",
    "we have implemented volumetric heating and cooling terms , and a thermal conduction term .",
    "the update due to net cooling is solved implicitly using newton - raphson iteration . for a given hydrodynamical time step ,",
    "the change in temperature in each zone is limited to be less than 25% .",
    "this is a somewhat larger fraction than the 10% limit used in paper i , which allows us to run with larger time steps needed to make 3d calculations practical .",
    "tests have shown that relaxing this constraint does not affect cloud structure ; @xmath14 t exceeds 10% only in a very small fraction of zones .",
    "the conduction term is solved explicitly using a seven point stencil for the second derivative of temperature .",
    "we also model the differential rotation of the background flow and the variation of the stellar / dark matter gravitational potential in the local limit with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the galactocentric radius of the center of our computational domain .",
    "the equations we solve are therefore :    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    all symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "the net cooling per unit mass is given by @xmath21 .",
    "we adopt the simple atomic ism heating and cooling prescriptions of @xcite , in which the cooling function , @xmath22 , is a piecewise power - law fit to the detailed models of @xcite .",
    "the heating rate , @xmath23 , is taken to be constant at 0.015 @xmath24 . in the tidal potential term of equation ( [ mom ] ) , @xmath25 is the local dimensionless shear parameter .",
    "we adopt @xmath26 equal to unity , to model a flat rotation curve in which the angular velocity @xmath27 .",
    "the present set of simulations is 3d , with the computational domain representing a cubic sector of the ism in the radial - azimuthal - vertical ( @xmath28 ) domain .",
    "we employ shearing - periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath29-direction @xcite , and periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath30- and @xmath31-directions , as originally implemented in zeus by @xcite .",
    "this framework allows us to incorporate realistic galactic shear , while avoiding numerical artifacts associated with simpler boundary conditions .",
    "we have previously used an isothermal version of the same code to study larger - scale galactic ism problems @xcite .",
    "we have parallelized the code with mpi to run on distributed - memory platforms .",
    "we perform a standard domain decomposition in @xmath29 , so that each processor works on a slab of the domain .",
    "decomposing in @xmath30 and @xmath31 as well would reduce message - passing time when running on more than eight processors , but for gigabit networks and faster the compute time exceeds the message - passing time for 128 or fewer processors in any case .",
    "thus , for our moderate problem sizes , the additional effort that would be required to parallelize the shearing - periodic boundary conditions is not merited .",
    "our standard resolution is @xmath32 zones . to confirm numerical convergence",
    ", we also performed one simulation at @xmath33 and found the results to be similar to the standard resolution run .",
    "our box is 200pc on each side , giving a resolution of about @xmath34 in our @xmath33 run , and about @xmath35 in our @xmath32 resolution runs .",
    "we set the conduction coefficient to @xmath36 .",
    "this level of conduction was chosen to allow us to resolve all modes of ti that are present ( see paper i ) . in our fiducial model ,",
    "the initial state of the gas is constant density , constant pressure with conditions comparable to mean values in the solar neighborhood ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding initial isothermal sound speed is @xmath39 .",
    "the initial magnetic field strength satisfies @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath41 g in the vertical ( @xmath31 ) direction .",
    "this is our `` standard '' run .",
    "additional simulations are performed with varying mean densities of @xmath42 and 4.0 @xmath43 , as well as one with lower magnetic field strength , @xmath44 .",
    "we also performed an isothermal simulation with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this value of @xmath47 was chosen so that the initial thermal pressure matches the mean late - time pressure in our cooling models .",
    "finally , we also performed a simulation with heating and cooling turned on that was initialized from the saturated - state , turbulent isothermal model . for all our models we adopt the galactic orbital period at the solar radius , @xmath48 , to normalize the shear rate .",
    "since increasing or decreasing the mean density by a large factor relative to @xmath49 would initialize the gas in a thermally @xmath50 state , some of our simulations are initialized with a medium already in a two - phase state , rather than with a uniform density . for these models ,",
    "spherical clouds of cold dense gas are inserted into a warm ambient medium at random locations .",
    "the number of clouds is adjusted so that the average density of the cloudy medium is at the desired level .",
    "a similar simulation was performed in paper i , which allowed us to study the growth rates of the mri in an initially quiescent cloudy medium . since the 2d simulations of paper i were axisymmetric there was no evolution of the model until mri modes began to grow .",
    "this allowed us to compare directly the mri growth rates of an adiabatic run with a two - phase run , illustrating the effect of cloud size and distribution on the growth rates .",
    "in the present 3d simulations , however , the evolution is rapid because the symmetry in the azimuthal direction is broken .",
    "individual clouds are sheared out relatively quickly , and also begin to merge with nearby clouds .",
    "nevertheless , because mri - driven turbulence eventually dominates both the initially - thermally - unstable and initially - two - phase models , at late times the two are indistinguishable .    on top of the initial conditions given above , we add pressure perturbations with a white noise spectrum at the 0.1% level to seed the ti and mri . in the next section ,",
    "we describe results from our standard run in detail , and comment on differences with the other runs as is appropriate .",
    "figures [ vol1 ] and [ vol2 ] are volume renderings of the 3d density data cube , from our run with fiducial parameters , and resolution @xmath33 , at @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbits .",
    "the early development of both ti and mri in the present set of 3d simulations is quite similar to the development previously described for 2d simulations in paper i. initially the gas is thermally unstable .",
    "the cooling time scale is much shorter than the orbital time scale , and the gas quickly separates into many small , cold clouds embedded in a warm ambient medium .",
    "this phase of the evolution lasts about 20 myr , which is comparable to the 2d simulations of paper i. the typical size scale of the clouds is about 5 pc , consistent with expectations for the fastest growing modes at the adopted level of conductivity .",
    "the size scale of the clouds is still fairly close to its initial distribution in figure [ vol1 ] at @xmath51 orbits .",
    "after the initial condensation phase of ti is complete , large scale galactic shear begins to drive the evolution . already at @xmath53 orbits ,",
    "the clouds have become elongated in the @xmath30 direction . during the first few orbits interactions take place between nearby clouds , which typically lead to mergers , increasing the typical size scale significantly . at about @xmath54 orbits ( @xmath55 )",
    "the modes of the mri have grown significantly and now begin to dominate the evolution of the model .",
    "the simulation becomes fully turbulent , drastically altering the dynamics compared to the axisymmetric model of paper i. shear from the mri with velocities in all directions , combined with galactic shear with velocities in the azimuthal direction , leads to repeated disruptive interactions and collisions between clouds .",
    "clouds merge into an interconnected network , with individual entities existing for only short periods of time .",
    "it is difficult to convey the dynamical nature of the simulations to the reader using only snapshots in time ; the animation associated with figures [ vol1]-[vol2 ] shows this much more clearly .",
    "while the structure remains highly dynamic , a quasi - equilibrium saturated state is established by @xmath56 orbits , and the statistical properties of the gas remain relatively constant throughout the latter half of the simulation ( up to t=10 orbits ) .",
    "the approach to a quasi - steady turbulent state in these models is generally similar to the results for isothermal or adiabatic single phase models ( e.g. hgb1 , hgb2 ) . in the remainder of  3",
    ", we discuss details of evolution and quasi - steady properties , similarities and differences from single - phase models , and dependencies on model parameters .      the density probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) from our standard run ( at @xmath32 )",
    "are shown in figure [ denpdf ] at @xmath57 and @xmath58 orbits .",
    "we show both mass - weighted and volume - weighted density pdfs in panels a - d , and compare the pdfs of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 runs in panel d. similar to our results in paper i , we find that by mass , most of the gas is in the cold phase , while the warm phase occupies most of the volume . after the initial development of ti has completed , at @xmath51 orbits , the mass fraction of gas in the warm ( f ) , unstable ( g ) , and cold ( h ) phases is 14% , 5% , and 80% , respectively . by volume ,",
    "83% , 9% , and 8% of the gas resides in the warm , unstable , and cold phases . from @xmath51 to @xmath59 orbits ( panels a and b of figure [ denpdf ] ) the evolution is driven mainly by galactic shear .",
    "the size distribution of the clouds shifts to larger masses through mergers , but the density pdfs over this interval vary little .",
    "the fraction of gas in each phase changes by only a few percent during this time period .",
    "in contrast , between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , panels b and c of figure [ denpdf ] , the evolution changes from being driven primarily by galactic shear , to being driven primarily by the mri .",
    "the model becomes fully turbulent , and this has a significant effect on the detailed shape of the density pdf .",
    "the fractions of gas in the warm , unstable , and cold phases at @xmath60 are now 10% , 7% , and 83% by mass , and 84% , 8% , and 7% by volume . near the end of the simulation , at @xmath61 , the gas fractions are 14% , 18% , and 67% percent by mass and 82% , 10% , and 6% percent by volume . from @xmath62 to @xmath61 , ( panel d of figure [ denpdf ] )",
    "the pdf remains very similar , indicating that the model has reached a quasi - steady state . at late times",
    ", gas is found at both lower and higher densities than was previously observed before the development of the mri .",
    "thus , the magnetized turbulence induces both strong compressions and significant rarefactions . compared to the maximum ( @xmath63 ) and minimum ( @xmath64 ) densities before the onset of turbulence , @xmath63 increases by an order of magnitude and @xmath64 decreases by a factor of about 3 .",
    "the fraction of gas in the intermediate density regime is a factor 2  3 larger after the full development of mri compared to early on .",
    "the proportion of thermally - unstable gas is never greater than 20% of the whole ( for this set of parameters ) , but exceeds the proportion of thermally - stable warm gas during the turbulent stages of evolution .    to investigate properties of individual condensations in our model",
    ", we use an algorithm similar to that of clumpfind @xcite .",
    "the algorithm was developed and applied by @xcite to identify clumps in simulations of turbulent molecular clouds .",
    "briefly , the algorithm first finds all local maximum values of density in the computational volume .",
    "all grid cells with a density higher than a chosen threshold density , @xmath65 , are assigned to the nearest local maximum .",
    "this set of continuous zones defines a clump .",
    "the only other parameter needed is a smoothing length , applied to the initial density data cube ( see gammie et al .",
    "2003 ) ; we set this to 1.5 grid zones . in figure [ mass_dn ]",
    "we show the clump mass spectrum for two different choices of threshold density , @xmath66 and 20 @xmath43 .",
    "this mass spectrum is computed at @xmath67 orbits .",
    "mass spectra from other late times are similar . with @xmath68 ,",
    "812 clumps were found , with a minimum clump mass of @xmath69 , and a maximum mass of @xmath70 . for reference ,",
    "the total mass in the simulation is @xmath71 .",
    "increasing the critical density to @xmath72 , we find 168 clumps , with a minimum mass of @xmath73 , and a maximum mass of @xmath74 .",
    "for both cases , the peak of the mass spectrum is in the range @xmath75 ; the peak increases slightly for larger @xmath65 .    to describe their shapes ,",
    "we compute diagonalized moment of inertia tensors for each clump , following @xcite .",
    "figure [ shape ] plots the ratios , for each clump , of the smallest ( c ) and intermediate ( b ) axes to the largest ( a ) axis .",
    "prolate - shaped clumps lie near the diagonal line , oblate clumps lie near the right side vertical axis , and triaxial clumps lie in the center . using two dotted lines to demarcate these groups",
    ", we find 38 % of the clumps are prolate , 49 % are triaxial , and 14% are oblate .",
    "although clumps are certainly not round , typical minimum to maximum axis ratios are about 2:1 .",
    "`` filaments '' , with c / a=0.1 are common , however , and these elongated structures are easy to pick out in figure [ vol2 ] .",
    "the pressure pdfs at @xmath76 and 9 orbits are presented in figure [ presspdf ] . at @xmath77 ,",
    "most of the gas falls within a narrow range of pressures , p / k=900 - 1300 @xmath78 .",
    "this is lower than p / k=2000 @xmath78 in the initial conditions , due to systematic cooling in the thermally unstable stage of evolution .",
    "the pressure pdf changes little from @xmath77 to @xmath79 orbits , shown in panels a and b of figure [ presspdf ] . with the development of mri ,",
    "however , gas is driven to both higher and lower pressures , as can be seen in panels c and d , at @xmath62 to @xmath61 orbits .",
    "the mean volume - weighted pressure at the end of the simulation is slightly lower than that after ti has developed , about p / k=1200 @xmath78 .",
    "the pressures in the cold and warm phases are approximately equal in the latter half of the simulation , while the pressure in the intermediate phase is slightly higher , about p / k=1300 @xmath78 .",
    "the dispersion in pressure early in the simulation is about @xmath80 , while late in the simulation this increases to as much as @xmath81 .    in figure [ coolcurve ]",
    "we show scatter plots of pressure against density overlayed on our model cooling curve at @xmath76 and 9 orbits .",
    "we also show contours of constant temperature to indicate the transitions between different phases of gas .",
    "only a fraction of the zones are included because of the large number of cells contained in our 3d simulations .",
    "early in the simulation ( panels a and b ) , the gas is close to pressure equilibrium , although high density gas lies closer to the thermal equilibrium curve .",
    "later in the simulation ( panels c and d ) , strong interactions between clouds can drive gas far from pressure equilibrium . at low densities where the cooling time scale is longer than the dynamical time",
    ", gas can be found at pressures as high as p / k=3200 @xmath78 and as low as 800 @xmath78 , a range of a factor four .",
    "much of the low - density gas is not in thermal equilibrium . in high density regions",
    "there is also a wide range of pressures observed ( p / k=800 - 4000 @xmath82 ) , but because the cooling time is very short ( @xmath83 yr ) this gas maintains thermal equilibrium . at early times , distributions of density and pressure",
    "are quite similar to the corresponding results from our 2d models ( paper i ) after the nonlinear development of ti . at late times , however , these 3d turbulent models show much broader pressure distributions than our 2d models .",
    "overall , the mean pressure averaged over orbits 6 - 10 is 1206 @xmath82 . by phase the mean",
    "pressure is @xmath84 1187 , 1324 , and 1195 @xmath78 in the warm , intermediate and cold phases .    also of interest",
    "are the temperature pdfs , shown in figure [ temppdf ] at the same times as in figure [ denpdf ] . in panels c and d ,",
    "the fraction of gas in the intermediate temperature phase has increased , and gas is also found at colder temperatures than are present earlier in the simulation .",
    "the minimum temperature is 80k , and respectively 60% and 68% of the gas mass is found between 80 - 120k at @xmath77 and @xmath85 orbits . at @xmath62 and 9",
    "orbits , on the other hand , respectively 30% and 18% of the gas is found at temperatures below 80k , while respectively another 32% and 31% of gas is at t=80 - 120 k. the range of temperatures in which the majority of cold gas is found increases by about a factor of two .",
    "the upper limit on temperature increases slightly throughout the run , but in addition , the dispersion of temperatures in the warm medium increases . at early times",
    ", @xmath8680% of the warm gas is in the range t=6600 - 8600k , whereas at late times , 80% is evenly distributed over twice as large a spread in temperatures .",
    "figure [ tempcomp ] compares the volume - weighted temperature pdfs of four runs of different mean density .",
    "these four runs have average densities of @xmath87 , and @xmath88 and , as we shall discuss in  [ kinetics ] , the mean velocity dispersion increases by an order of magnitude from the highest to lowest mean density models .",
    "the pdfs in figure [ tempcomp ] represent averages from 6.0 - 6.5 orbits . at intermediate and high temperatures , the pdfs for these runs",
    "are quite similar .",
    "most of the warm gas is at t=6000 - 8000 k , with @xmath89 10000 k. most of the cold phase is at temperatures near 100 k , possibly showing a slight trend towards higher mean temperature as @xmath90 is decreased .",
    "overall there is less gas at lower temperature when @xmath90 is reduced , because the total mass available for cold clouds is lower .",
    "in addition to having similar warm and cold gas temperatures , the models with various @xmath90 are similar in that the fractions of gas in the intermediate- and warm - temperature regimes are always quite close .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure [ massfrac ] , which plots the mass fractions in the various regimes as a function of @xmath90 ( also including the @xmath91 model ) .",
    "overplotted in figure [ massfrac ] are curves indicating the warm and cold gas mass fractions that a pure two - phase medium would have .",
    "the mass fraction of cold gas in a perfect two - phase medium in thermal and pressure equilibrium is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the cold density , @xmath94 is the warm density , and @xmath8 is the mean density .",
    "the mass fraction of warm gas is then @xmath95 .",
    "the density of warm gas in our simulations is typically @xmath96 , which we use to compute the theoretical curves in figure [ massfrac ] .",
    "the possibility exists that our choice of initial conditions in the standard run , a uniform medium at the average density , may have some effect on the amount of gas in the intermediate phase at late times .",
    "due to ti , initially most of the gas collects into small , dense cold clouds , and only a small proportion of the gas remains in the thermally unstable regime .",
    "later in the simulation , the mri drives a larger fraction of gas into the unstable phase .",
    "it is possible that if we had _ begun _ with a turbulent medium , this fraction would be even larger , from increased shock heating of moderate density clouds with larger collision cross sections . to investigate this , we initialized a simulation with the same mean density and magnetic field as our standard run , but evolved it with an isothermal equation of state .",
    "the sound speed was set so that the initial @xmath97 matches late time averages from our standard run .",
    "after the isothermal evolution has proceeded for 10 orbits and reached a saturated turbulent state , heating and cooling are enabled . after a quasi - steady state",
    "is reestablished , we measure the mass fractions in the warm , intermediate , and cold regimes .",
    "the result is respective proportions of about 11% , 14% , and 75% , which is similar to our results from standard run .",
    "thus , we conclude that the long - term thermal history does not strongly affect the present state of the gas .",
    "in figure [ mach ] we plot the mass - weighted mach number @xmath98 of the gas in each thermal phase ( warm , intermediate , cold ) as a function of time for the duration of the simulation .",
    "we also include , for comparison , the mass - weighted mach number of the cold medium for the high resolution run at @xmath33 .",
    "the isothermal sound speed @xmath99 is computed individually for all grid zones , and the galactic shear is subtracted from the azimuthal ( @xmath100 ) velocity before computing @xmath101 .",
    "initially , motions in all three phases of the gas are subsonic , @xmath102 , and remain so until the mri begins to develop at about 800 myr ( @xmath103 orbits ) .",
    "once the mri saturates ( at @xmath56 orbits ) , the typical mach numbers of the warm , intermediate and cold phases of the gas are 0.4 , 1.8 , and 2.9 .",
    "the peak value of @xmath104 for the cold phase is about 3.2 .",
    "the mean late time velocity dispersion for all three phases of the gas is similar , approximately @xmath105 . at late times , the individual velocity dispersions in the radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions are 1.9 , 1.7 , and 0.7  @xmath106 , respectively .    to explore the dependence of saturated state turbulence on system parameters , for our five simulations of varying mean density @xmath90 we have computed the average mach number over @xmath107 orbits .",

    "the mean energy density typically varies by 10% during the latter half of the simulation .",
    "if total energy were perfectly conserved , as noted above , the energy inputs from maxwell and reynolds stresses would be balanced by net cooling .",
    "the energy source for this radiative cooling would , in turn , be provided by compressive work and dissipation of turbulence .",
    "the present simulation , however , in fact captures only part of the turbulent dissipation  that in shock heating , as mediated by artificial viscosity .",

    "oppositely - directed magnetic fields and shear flows , when advected into a single zone , are averaged to zero .",
    "since zeus evolves a ( non - conservative ) internal energy equation rather than a total energy equation , the associated energy from those small - scale sheared @xmath142 and @xmath143 fields is lost . in principle , these dissipation terms could be captured if explicit resistivity and shear viscosity were included .      although the present simulations are highly idealized in many ways ( e.g. they are vertically periodic rather than stratified ) , it is interesting to explore model properties that bear a close relation to observables .",

    "velocity profile broadening and skewness statistically give evidence that more than one component is present , but we find no correlation between increased spatial coherence and increased velocity profile symmetry in any given direction .",
    "we do not observe any structure which shows two distinct lines .",
    "the absence of velocity profiles with two distinct peaks owes in part to the thermal broadening , which smears out smaller scale features .",
    "however , the primary reason that profiles are single - peaked is that velocity modes at a large range of wavenumbers are present in saturated state mri - driven turbulence .",
    "since there is no single dominant wavelength along the line - of - sight , the range of velocities is smoothly filled .",
    "the spatial resolution of the synthetic observations was doubled to determine if the structure of the velocity profiles would be affected .",

    "in this paper , we present results from a set of numerical mhd simulations that focus on the interrelationship between turbulence and thermal structure .",
    "the models we have performed are three dimensional , and include sheared galactic rotation and magnetic fields .",
    "turbulence therefore is generated by the magnetorotational instability .",
    "we also include a radiative cooling function that , in pressure equilibrium , would yield a two - phase medium .",
    "the two fundamental issues we have addressed are ( 1 ) how cloudy structure alters the saturated - state properties and scalings of mri - driven turbulence , compared to single - phase mri models , and ( 2 ) how turbulence that is _ not _ driven by direct ( stellar ) thermal energy inputs affects the thermal balance and phase structure in the warm / cold atomic medium .",
    "_ evolution and physical structure : _ a two - phase cloudy medium with many small clouds develops in the first 20 myr of our simulations . over time , due initially to galactic shear , and later ( @xmath151 orbits ) to mri - driven turbulence , these clouds undergo a continual series of mergers and disruptions , leading to a late - time state in which the mass function of condensations peaks at a few hundred @xmath152 .",
    "the dense condensations are triaxial , and typically have max : min axis ratios of 2:1 .",
    "they consist of cold gas lumps surrounded by envelopes of thermally - unstable gas ; filling all of the remaining volume is thermally - stable warm gas .",
    "_ density and temperature distributions : _ for the range of parameters we have explored , in late stages of evolution most of the gas mass is in the cold phase , while most of the volume is occupied by the warm phase . while the proportion of thermally - unstable intermediate - temperature gas in a given model increases after the advent of mri , at all stages the density and temperature pdfs show distinct warm and cold phases , with a varying amount of material in the `` non - equilibrium '' valley between these peaks .",
    "the peaks , near @xmath153 and @xmath154 , also broaden as the turbulence develops .",
    "the relative proportions in each phase depend on the mean density , varying from 95% cold gas when the mean density @xmath155 , to 50% cold gas when @xmath156 .",
    "the fractions of thermally - unstable gas and warm gas are always comparable to each other . increasing levels of turbulence yield increasing proportions of thermally - unstable gas .",
    "relative to the proportions predicted for a two - phase , quiescent medium in thermal and pressure equilibrium , increasing turbulence also tends to _ increase _ the fraction of cold gas , while decreasing the fraction of warm stable gas .",
    "_ pressure : _ we initialize our models at @xmath157 , but secular cooling in the stages before mri develops leaves the gas in approximate pressure equilibrium ( @xmath158 ) at a lower mean pressure of @xmath159 , near the minimum for which two stable gas phases can be present .",
    "after mri develops , pressures cover a much wider range of values ( @xmath160 ) , with a maximum at @xmath161 , but relatively unchanged mean value ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "_ turbulent velocities : _ after the mri saturates at @xmath163 orbits , the turbulent velocity dispersion reaches a quasi - steady plateau  albeit with fluctuations of @xmath164 in amplitude . for our fiducial model with @xmath165 , the mean late time ( 3d ) velocity dispersion is @xmath166 for all three components .",
    "this velocity corresponds to mean mach numbers of 0.4 , 1.8 and 2.9 in the warm , intermediate , and cold phases .",
    "we examined the effect of mean density on the velocity dispersion , and found that @xmath167 overall , with slightly shallower slope for the warm gas alone .",
    "our results show , additionally , that the reynolds stress , @xmath168 , varies with mean density @xmath169 .",
    "we find that the in - plane components of the velocity dispersion exceed the component perpendicular to the disk by about a factor of two .",
    "_ magnetic fields : _ for the present set of models , we have adopted initial conditions with a uniform vertical magnetic field of strength @xmath170 g .",
    "the mri enhances the field by an order of magnitude , so that @xmath171 is typically @xmath121 g late in the simulation .",
    "the field strength is similar ( within @xmath172 ) in all three phases of gas , and there is no significant trend of field strength with mean simulation density @xmath8 .",

    "synthetic line profiles : _ as a demonstration of the potential for employing simulations to interpret observational diagnostics , we have computed maps of synthetic line profiles from sample data cubes . we find that the line profiles are generally single - peaked ( although in some cases would require two or three components if a standard gaussian fitting scheme were performed ) . in no case did we identify two distinct velocity components , even though there are distinct cloud structures present along many lines of sight . because turbulence has a smooth power spectrum ,",
    "this kind of overlap in velocity space is inevitable .",
    "our results have several interesting implications for interpreting ism observations , and it is also interesting to compare with recent numerical and theoretical work on the ism and on mri dynamics .",
    "we conclude by discussing these connections .",
    "high levels of turbulence are observed both in the atomic gas of the milky way , and in that of external spiral galaxies , and it has been suggested that the mri could be an important contributor to this turbulence , especially in the outer parts of galaxies where there is little star formation .",
    "our models are the first ( to our knowledge ) to address this issue directly with an appropriate physical model ",
    "namely , one that admits two stable thermal phases , such that the mri must develop in a cloudy medium with density contrasts of 100 between clumps and diffuse gas . while the turbulent velocity that develops in our fiducial model with mean density @xmath165 is relatively modest , the scaling of the turbulent amplitude with @xmath175 is quite steep , such that @xmath176 is predicted when @xmath177 .",
    "the scaling of turbulent velocity dispersion with mean density indicates that mri may play a significant role in the outer regions of the galaxy . beyond the point in the milky way where the stellar surface density drops , the gas scale height rapidly increases , and the volume density correspondingly decreases ; this sort of disk flaring is also seen in external galaxies . in the @xcite milky way model , for example",
    ", @xmath8 falls below @xmath178 at @xmath179 .",
    "the outer - galaxy pressure in the @xcite model is nevertheless high enough for cold - phase gas to be present , so that if it were _ not _ turbulent , then a thin gravitationally unstable layer would develop . ( the threshold for instability ) for @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the gas surface density .",
    "@xcite show that cold gas is expected to be present at all radii out to 18 kpc . since @xmath181 is estimated to exceed @xmath182 inside this radius , even if only 20% of the gas is in the cold component , the layer would be gravitationally unstable . ]",
    "our results suggest that the mri could be maintaining high - amplitude turbulence , and hence suppressing star formation , in the far outer milky way and other spiral galaxies .",
    "we note that the increase in scale height is necessary for this to hold ; since the minimum mri wavelength @xmath183 , mri - driven turbulence can only be sustained in a sufficiently thick disk .    even in the inner disk ,",
    "our results suggest that mri may be a significant contributor to turbulence in the ism . at a mean inner - galaxy ( @xmath184 ) midplane density of @xmath185 @xcite",
    ", our results would predict @xmath186 . away from the midplane where the density drops",
    ", the turbulent amplitudes would increase .",
    "the mean inner - disk vertical magnetic field strength may also be somewhat larger than the fiducial value we have adopted ( @xcite obtained @xmath187 g from pulsar observations ) , which would tend to increase the amplitude of the turbulence .",
    "a more extensive parameter survey  allowing for disk stratification , varying scale height , and differing initial field strengths and distributions  is needed to quantify more fully the expected contribution from mri to turbulent amplitudes in the ism .",
    "another important question is whether mri development could be quantitatively altered by interaction with large - scale pertubations driven by supernovae or spiral shocks .",
    "we defer consideration of this interesting issue to future work",
    ".    direct comparisons between simulations and observations regarding levels of turbulence and magnetic field strength as a function of local parameters would be very useful .",
    "unfortunately , observations at this time do not permit such comparisons to be made .",
    "hi velocity dispersions in the milky way can only be measured within @xmath86 1 kpc of the sun ( e.g. @xcite ) . in external",
    "near - face - on galaxies , observed ( vertical ) velocity dispersions combine both turbulent and thermal contributions , and these values do not vary secularly with galactic radii ( although dispersions are significant ) even well beyond the optical disk ( see  1 ) . magnetic field strengths in the milky way beyond @xmath86 10 kpc",
    "have not been measured directly ( i.e. with faraday rotation ; see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for both the milky way and external galaxies , one may use synchrotron emission @xcite to obtain the product of the magnetic and cosmic ray energy densities as a function of galactic radius , but since the equipartition assumption need not be satisfied everywhere , this does not yield a b - field strength except locally , where electron cosmic - ray and gamma - ray observations can be made . milky way",
    "outer - galaxy field strengths of 2 - 3 @xmath125 g are consistent with synchrotron / cosmic ray models of @xcite .",
    "the scalings we find for mri amplitudes show interesting differences from those obtained with single - phase gaseous media , in previous adiabatic and isothermal simulations . in the shearing - box models of hgb1 , hgb2 , and @xcite , all of the measures of turbulence scale together  i.e. @xmath188 . for simulations with net vertical magnetic flux ,",
    "hgb1 further reported that these stresses and energy densities scale @xmath189 , where @xmath190 and @xmath47 are the initial alfvn speed and sound speed , respectively .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , identify a scaling of stresses @xmath191 in the mean alfvn speed , and also demonstrate that the pressure dependence of the saturated - state stresses are very weak .    while we have not surveyed cases with differing magnetic field strengths , our models at varying mean density have varying @xmath190 . at fixed mean @xmath192",
    ", the single - phase medium simulations cited above would predict scalings @xmath193 or @xmath194 for @xmath7 , @xmath195 , and the stresses . for our cloudy - medium simulations ,",
    "we in fact find that @xmath7 is nearly independent of @xmath175 , while other scalings in our models are either in the same range as the single - phase predictions ( i.e. @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) , or slightly steeper ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "interestingly , 3d mri simulations in radiation - dominated disks @xcite , which like our models contain strong density contrasts , also show a steep dependence of the stress @xmath199 .",
    "the reason for the difference between single - phase and cloudy - medium results for saturated - state @xmath7 scalings is not yet clear , but the lack of dependence on @xmath8 in our models suggests that local , rather than global , properties of the gas determine the field strength that develops .",
    "the densities in the diffuse phase and in the dense phase are similar for all our models ; only the filling factor of cold clouds differs appreciably .",
    "if the saturated - state field strength depends on the reconnection rate , and this depends on local gas densities and field geometry , then the fact that these properties are the same in all our two - phase models might explain the lack of dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 . our isothermal model , which has less - kinked magnetic field , and typical ( log ) densities midway between @xmath200 and @xmath201 , indeed has saturated - state values of the rms field strength 20 - 50% higher than the standard run ( @xmath202 g in the isothermal model , compared to 2.4 , 2.7 , and 2.9 @xmath125 g in the f , g , and h phases for the standard run ) .",
    "further study , with particular focus on the rate and spatial distribution of reconnection , is needed to clarify this issue .    while the saturated - state magnetic field strength depends on a balance between mri - driven amplification and ( numerical or true resistive ) dissipation , the saturated - state velocity dispersion depends on a balance between mri driving and losses in shocks , compressions , and ( numerical or true viscous ) shear dissipation . since turbulent velocities are similar in all the gas components , while the mass is concentrated in the cold clouds , in paper i we proposed that the cloud collision time may be a good proxy for the kinetic energy dissipation time .",
    "the kinetic energy dissipated per unit time per unit mass is then @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is a cloud size and @xmath205 is the gas density within clouds .",
    "the kinetic energy input rate per unit mass due to mri is an order - unity constant times @xmath206 .",
    "balancing inputs with dissipation , and using @xmath207 from our simulations , this predicts a scaling for the saturated - state velocity dispersion @xmath208 .",
    "this prediction indeed agrees well with the velocity dispersion scaling measured directly from our simulations , @xmath209 .",
    "of course , this scaling can not continue to arbitrarily low density , because the mri becomes stabilized if the wavelength @xmath210 exceeds the height of the disk .",
    "in previous analytic work on magnetized cloud - cloud collisions @xcite argued that effective cloud cross sections should vary @xmath211 .",
    "although we do not measure this effect directly , it would not be expected to change our results significantly . taking this into account for @xmath204 in the above analysis , the predicted power - law scaling exponent for @xmath5 with @xmath212 changes by only 0.02 .      as noted above",
    ", our results show only minor differences between typical magnetic field strengths in gas of different phases , with the cold medium having slightly higher @xmath130 .",
    "if flux were frozen to the gas , and cold clouds contracted isotropically out of the warm ism due to ti , then the field strengths would differ by a factor 20 between diffuse and dense phases . evidently , however , this is not the case : observationally , @xcite reports the @xmath130-fields in cold atomic clouds are no stronger than in the diffuse ism overall .",
    "our models are consistent with this result , in part because clouds in fact do not condense isotropically ( but instead preferentially gather material along field lines ) , and in part because field lines can diffuse relative to matter ( in our models , this is purely numerical , but turbulent diffusion is likely to play the same physical role ) .",
    "synthetic line profiles of the sort we have computed are potentially of great value in interpreting observations of the ism , and in particular , the emission and absorption profiles of the 21 cm hydrogen line .",
    "ensemble properties of the atomic ism , including the turbulent velocity dispersion for the cold gas separately , can be unambiguously obtained from observed position - velocity data cubes .",
    "our results illustrate the difficulty , however , in discerning detailed ( local ) structural properties of the ism directly from line profiles , due to overlapping in velocity space ( cf .",
    "ostriker , stone , & gammie 2001 ) .",
    "fortunately , recent work has demonstrated that analysis techniques calibrated using simulations can be used to extract fundamental statistical properties such as power spectra from co observations of turbulent molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , and it will be interesting to test whether the same holds true for hi gas .",
    "what do we conclude regarding the dynamics / thermodynamics connection in the turbulent atomic ism ? as alluded to in  1 , recent observations @xcite have suggested that at least 30% of the hi gas at high latitudes ( where blending due to galactic rotation is minimized ) is in the thermally - unstable regime ( @xmath213 k ) .",
    "another 30% of the hi mass at high latitudes is estimated to be warm , thermally - stable gas.k in the @xcite data , suggesting that midplane gas may be much more likely to be in thermal equilibrium . ]",
    "interestingly , we find that in our simulations , the warm and thermally - unstable gas mass fractions are also always very similar . in our models ,",
    "the warm+unstable mass fraction only approaches 50% for the lowest-@xmath175 case ; at @xmath214 , the warm+unstable gas comprises 30% of the total mass .",
    "however , except at the lowest @xmath175 , the turbulent amplitudes in our models are also somewhat lower than in the real ism , so in part the lower warm+unstable fractions we find may owe to lower rates of turbulent dissipation . in addition , as discussed in  3.6 , because our numerical method is non - conservative , a significant fraction of the input turbulent energy from the mri is lost without being thermalized .",
    "our method therefore underestimates the heating rate",
    ". this may be especially true in high density regions where the magnetic field curvature is large , so that the current density @xmath215 is large , and the resistive heating @xmath216 should also be large . we intend to explore this issue in future work incorporating explicit resistivity , also comparing with results using a conservative algorithm to update the energy equation .",
    "overall , our results are consistent with the recent work of @xcite , who performed high resolution 2d simulations of a converging flow in which turbulence develops , using a cooling function very similar to ours .",
    "the temperature and density pdfs from their models are qualitatively similar to ours , in particular showing evidence for the existence of a two - phase medium even in the most turbulent case .",
    "similar to our results , they found that the proportion of thermally - unstable gas increases with the amplitude of turbulence .",
    "for their least turbulent model , about 10% of the gas was thermally unstable , while this fraction increased to 30% in models with larger turbulent amplitudes .",
    "other recent work , based on simulations that include modeled effects of star formation via prescriptions for ob star heating ( e.g. @xcite ) and supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) , have found significant fractions of gas in the unstable phase , and many have advocated for a shift away from the classical two- or three - phase medium concept towards more of a `` phase continuum '' description",
    ". however , the former set of models have energy inputs from `` star formation '' in cold atomic gas ( rather than in self - gravitating molecular clouds ) , which likely leads to overestimating the amount of thermally - unstable gas .",
    "the latter models have not included low - temperature cooling , so no cold phase can form .",
    "thus , it is not yet clear whether realistic models incorporating turbulence driven by star formation would indeed produce an extended , featureless continuum of temperatures , or whether they would yield bimodal distributions similar to those we have found with solely mri - driven turbulence .",
    "we believe that , given the observed turbulent amplitudes ( @xmath217 ) and characteristic spatial scales ( the disk thickness @xmath218 pc ) for the atomic ism , quasi - two - phase distributions are inevitable .",
    "the heating time @xmath219 yr is a factor of a few longer than the cooling time in gas at densities @xmath220 ( see eq . [ 5 ] of paper i or eq .",
    "[ 4 ] of @xcite ) , so that moderate but not extreme departures from thermal equilibrium can be expected in diffuse gas . in dense gas ,",
    "cooling times are very short , so thermal equilibrium must hold , but typical order - unity variations in pressure from sonic - level turbulence can lead to moderate local density and temperature variations .",
    "future work will be able to determine whether , with realistic turbulent amplitudes and fully - captured energy dissipation , thermal distributions from models can indeed match those from hi observations , or whether additional heat sources are required .",

    "<S> this paper reports on three - dimensional numerical simulations of dynamics and thermodynamics in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) . </S>",
    "<S> our models are local , account for sheared galactic rotation , magnetic fields , and realistic cooling , and resolve scales @xmath0 pc . </S>",
    "<S> this combination permits the study of quasi - steady - state turbulence in a cloudy medium representing the warm / cold atomic ism . </S>",
    "<S> turbulence is driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ; our models are the first to study the saturated state of mri under strongly inhomogeneous conditions , with cloud / intercloud density and temperature contrasts @xmath1 . for volume - averaged densities @xmath2 , the mean saturated - state velocity dispersion ranges from @xmath3 , with a scaling @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the mri is therefore likely quite important in driving turbulence in low - density regions of the ism , both away from the midplane in the inner galaxy ( as observed at high latitudes ) , and throughout the far outer galaxy ( where the mean density drops and the disk flares ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mri may even be key to suppressing star formation at large radii in spiral galaxies , where the pressure can be high enough that without mri - driven turbulence , a gravitationally - unstable cold layer would form . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , we find that turbulence affects the thermal structure of the ism . in all our simulations , the fraction of thermally - unstable gas increases as the mri develops , and in the saturated state is largest in high-@xmath5 models . </S>",
    "<S> the mass fractions of warm - stable and unstable gas are typically comparable , in agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> while inclusion of resistive dissipation of magnetic fields could enhance the amount of thermally - unstable gas compared to current models , our present results indicate that even high levels of turbulence can not wipe out the signature of thermal instability , and that a shift to a `` phase continuum '' description is probably unwarranted . instead </S>",
    "<S> , we find that temperature and density pdfs are broadened ( and include extreme departures from equilibrium ) , but retain the bimodal character of the classical two - phase description . </S>",
    "<S> our presentation also includes results on the distribution of clump masses ( the mass spectrum peaks at @xmath6 ) , comparisons of saturated - state mri scalings with single - phase simulation results ( we find @xmath7 is independent of @xmath8 ) , and examples of synthetic hi line profile maps ( showing that physical clumps are not easily distinguished in velocity components , and vice versa ) . </S>"
