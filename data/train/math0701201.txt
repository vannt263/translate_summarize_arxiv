    "diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) , is a growth model introduced by witten and sander ( @xcite ) .",

    "when the particle first hits the outer boundary of the cluster , it sticks and the next step starts , forming a growing family of clusters .",

    "a precise definition is given in section [ scn : definition of cdla process ] .",
    "this paper contains three main results :    the first , theorem [ thm : e [ t_m ] leq o(nm ) ] , states that if @xmath1 has small enough mixing time , then the time it takes the cluster to reach the @xmath3-th layer of the cylinder is @xmath10 , were @xmath11 is the size of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , for a graph @xmath1 with mixing time at most @xmath12 ( for any constant @xmath13 ) , the time to reach the @xmath3-th layer is at most of order @xmath14 .",
    "this phenomenon is sometimes dubbed as `` the aggregate grows arms '' , i.e. grows faster than order @xmath11 particles per layer .",
    "the analogous phenomenon in the original dla model on @xmath8 is considered a notoriously difficult open problem . in @xcite , kesten provides upper bounds on the growth rate of the dla aggregate in @xmath8 .",
    "eberz - wagner @xcite proved the existence of infinitely many holes in the two - dimensional dla aggregate .",
    "the second result concerns the density of the limit cluster , the union of all clusters obtained at some finite time .",
    "theorem [ thm : e[d ] leq lim ( 1/mn ) e[t_m ] ] shows that the expected rate at which the cluster grows bounds this density .",

    "2 .   theorem [ thm : d(n ) leq 3/log log n for rm family of graphs ] shows that for @xmath1 with small enough mixing time , the density tends to @xmath16 as the size of @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "finally , theorem [ thm : lower bound on speed ] is a lower bound on the expected time the cluster reaches the @xmath3-th layer , complementing the upper bound in theorem [ thm : e [ t_m ] leq o(nm ) ] .",
    "this lower bound implies that the cluster can not grow too fast , and in fact for many natural graphs it can not grow faster than @xmath17 for some universal @xmath18 .",
    "the lower bound holds for a wider range of graphs at the base of the cylinder than the upper bound ( including @xmath15-dimensional tori for @xmath9 ) .",
