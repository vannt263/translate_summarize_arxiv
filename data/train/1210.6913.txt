    "recently there has been a resurgence of interest in f - theory as a non - perturbative formulation of type iib superstring theory which allows for the decoupling of gravity and for the formulation of gut theories ( first proposed in @xcite ) based on the gauge group @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although descending from a high energy @xmath0 group , most of the models in the literature @xcite focus on reproducing the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at low energies , making it difficult to obtain an experimental link to f - theory . in this paper",
    "we explore f - theory models in which the low energy supersymmetric theory contains the particle content of three 27 dimensional representations of the underlying @xmath0 gauge group .",
    "the resulting low energy models will resemble either the e6ssm @xcite or a generalised nmssm+ @xcite depending on whether an additional abelian gauge group does or does not survive .",
    "however there are novel features compared to both these models which , if observed , would provide circumstantial evidence for f - theory .",
    "the f - theory models considered in this paper all descend from a parent @xmath5 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "a crucial question for model construction is whether a gauged @xmath6 from the @xmath5 gauge theory can survive down to low energies , where the gauged @xmath6 may arise from one of the cartan generators of the non - abelian gauge group .",
    "a clear example of this is the case of hypercharge @xmath7 , arising from su(5 ) after flux breaking in many f - theory models @xcite .",
    "more generally , if we begin with the case of an @xmath0 gut group , we can break @xmath0 down to the standard model gauge group by turning on fluxes in @xmath6s in the following sequence of rank preserving breakings : e_6 & & so(10)u(1 ) _ [ so(10 ) ] + so(10 ) & & su(5)u(1 ) _ [ su(5)0 ] + su(5 ) & & su(3 ) su(2 ) u(1)_y [ sm0 ] .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 under which the right handed neutrinos have no charge is given in terms of these @xmath6s by , @xmath9 in terms of f - theory model building , the case of successive flux breaking starting with @xmath0 can be studied in the so called spectral cover formalism @xcite , where the model building choices relating to the particle content of the model amount to making choices about the flux breaking . in the f - theory models considered in this paper",
    ", there will either be a surviving gauged @xmath8 , or it will be broken by flux breaking at the gut scale .",
    "the f - theory models with a surviving abelian gauge group resembles the e6ssm @xcite which is a supersymmetric standard model in which precisely such an extra @xmath8 gauge symmetry survives down to the tev scale .",
    "however in the f - theory model the gauge coupling of the @xmath8 may differ from that on the e6ssm and may be much weaker for example .",
    "the matter spectrum is similar to that of the e6ssm , namely three 27s of e6 which ensures anomaly cancellation .",
    "this implies light exotics with the quantum numbers of higgs doublets and colour triplets of exotic quarks , arising from three @xmath10 representations of su(5 ) , plus three su(5 ) singlets which are charged under @xmath8 .",
    "the coupling one of these singlets to @xmath11 generates an effective @xmath12 term after the the singlet acquires a low scale vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the f - theory version of the e6ssm does not require any additional states in order to achieve unification , unlike the e6ssm which includes an additional pair of doublet states called @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it more closely resembles the minimal e6ssm ( me6ssm ) proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , in the f - theory model , the gauge couplings at the gut scale are split by flux effects , while in the me6ssm , unification is achieved via an intermediate pati - salam gauge group .",
    "proton decay represents another important difference between the two models . in the f - theory model proton decay",
    "is suppressed by the geometric coupling suppression of a singlet state , which effectively suppresses the coupling of the exotic charge @xmath1 colour triplet state @xmath2 to quarks and leptons , while in the me6ssm all proton decay couplings are allowed but with highly suppressed coefficients .",
    "this tends to give long lived @xmath2 decays in the me6ssm , but prompt @xmath2 decays in the f - theory model , with large couplings to left - handed quarks and leptons , providing characteristic and striking signatures at the lhc .",
    "if there is no surviving extra abelian gauge group then the f - theory model resembles the nmssm+ which also involves three compete 27 dimensional families @xcite .",
    "however , whereas in the nmssm+ the @xmath8 is broken by an additional sector close to the gut scale , in the f - theory model it is simply broken by flux breaking .",
    "another important difference is that the nmssm+ is a scale invariant theory , involving only trilinear couplings such as the trilinear singlet couplings , while in the case of f - theory there are in addition singlet mass terms arising from non - perturbative effects , giving rise to a generalised version of the nmssm+ .",
    "the phenomenological comments in the preceding paragraph concerning unification , proton decay and the @xmath3 couplings at the lhc all apply to this case as well where the @xmath8 is broken .",
    "the main advantage of the nmssm+ over the e6ssm is that the fine - tuning is lower due to the absence of @xmath8 d - terms which would introduce a term in the higgs potential proportional to the fourth power of the @xmath15 mass as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the nmssm+ , involving three compete 27 dimensional families , has lower fine - tuning than the nmssm , which in turn has lower fine - tuning than the mssm @xcite , making it the lowest fine - tuned model consistent with perturbative unification .",
    "@xmath0 based f - theory models have been discussed previously , for example , issues concerning the global resolution of @xmath0 guts in @xcite , and the models of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that here we use abelian fluxes , whereas @xcite uses non - abelian fluxes .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "since many readers will not be familiar with f - theory , in section 2 of the paper we give a basic review of the motivation and basics of f - theory , building up to analysing the flux breaking mechanism in this way . in section 3 ,",
    "the model building strategies are applied to the case of @xmath0 models .",
    "the d flatness conditions are considered in order to calculate the singlet vevs of the model .",
    "this allows us to calculate the scale at which the exotics decouple .",
    "quark , charged lepton and neutrino masses are also discussed . in section 4 , unification and proton decay",
    "are studied in the f - theory models . in section 5 ,",
    "the @xmath0 based f - theory models are compared to the known e6ssm and nmssm+ models .",
    "section 6 concludes the paper .",
    "a major motivation for string theory is that it provides a consistent formulation of quantum gravity , the effects of which are expected to become important at the planck scale . with this achievement",
    "though , comes the drawback that it is very hard to predict anything about low energy physics , due to the vast numbers of consistent solutions to the string theory equations of motion . if , however , we follow the arguments of @xcite and impose the conditions of unification and decoupling on the search for realistic models , the possibilities are severely restricted .",
    "unification refers to the existence of a gut structure whereby the strong , weak and electromagnetic forces are described by a single gauge group and a single coupling constant at some high energy scale .",
    "the fact that gravity is observed to be much weaker than the other forces is linked to the term `` decoupling '' , which refers to the existence of a theoretical limit where @xmath16 .",
    "a class of models which satisfy both the criteria of unification and decoupling are f - theory guts .",
    "f - theory is a 12 dimensional , strongly coupled formulation of type iib superstring theory . before considering this strongly coupled case , we can note the case of perturbative type iib string theory , which refers to a 10 dimensional theory where 6 of the dimensions are compactified , and the string coupling constant @xmath17 ( which governs how strongly the strings interact with one another ) is small , @xmath18 . in this perturbative regime ,",
    "the particles of the standard model ( sm ) are described by excitations of open strings , whereas the graviton and gravitino are related to closed strings .",
    "motivated by the weakness of gravity , one could try and formulate the sm by just using open strings , the ends of which are attached to d - branes @xcite . in the effective field theory of such d - brane constructions , sm or",
    "gut matter arises when strings are attached to pairs of d - brane stacks , and so these matter fields are localised along the intersections of branes called `` matter curves '' .",
    "a problem with this perturbative setup in su(5 ) guts , however , is that whilst we can generate a tree level yukawa coupling for the bottom quark , we can not for the top quark since both its chiral components live in the same gut representation ( the @xmath19 of su(5 ) ) and the yukawa interaction terms with a higgs @xmath20 , namely @xmath21 , do not match up an equal number of fundamental and anti - fundamental indices @xcite .",
    "guts based on so(10 ) or exceptional groups also have problems .",
    "the spinor 16 of so(10 ) can not be realised in open string perturbation theory , and e - type gauge groups are not possible .",
    "this all suggests the need for extra non - perturbative ingredients . with a non - perturbative string coupling constant @xmath22",
    ", exceptional gauge groups such as @xmath0 , @xmath23 and @xmath5 can be realised , meaning that now , in the language of an su(5 ) gut , both the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 couplings can be realised at tree level , due to the presence of these exceptional structures which were nt present in the case of perturbative strings .",
    "this , therefore , leads us to the case where @xmath22 and f - theory .",
    "formally , f - theory can be defined on a background @xmath26 where @xmath27 is 4 dimensional space time , and x is a calabi - yau ( cy ) complex fourfold .",
    "it is assumed that x is elliptically fibered with a section over a complex three - fold base , @xmath28 .",
    "what this means is that each point of the base @xmath28 is represented by a two - torus , these tori being called the fibres .",
    "the dimensions occupied by the base are the 6 compactified dimensions of type iib string theory , and the complex modulus of the torus fibre encodes the axion and dilaton at each point on the base @xcite :",
    "@xmath29    it is a fact that the presence of d7-branes ( filling 7 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension ) affects the profile of the axio - dilaton , @xmath30 @xcite . as such , the reason that f - theory can be viewed as a 12 dimensional theory is that two dimensions are geometric dimensions which allow us to keep track of the variation of @xmath30 over the other ten dimensions .    in f - theory , the gut group is realised on a 7-brane which wraps some 2 complex dimensional surface s. we can learn a lot by studying so called semi - local models , where the complications of global f - theory ( as discussed in @xcite)are avoided by just looking at regions close to the gut surface s.      the ideas of local f - theory focus on the submanifold s , where the gut symmetry is localised .",
    "we can consider intersections of the gauge brane with other 7-branes wrapping surfaces @xmath31 and supporting gauge groups @xmath32 .",
    "along these intersections matter will reside , and so they are known as matter curves , @xmath33 . along the matter curves ,",
    "the local symmetry group is enhanced to @xmath34 .",
    "we can go one step further than this and then study the intersections of matter curves at points in s. when we have an intersection of matter curves , we induce a yukawa coupling and there is a further enhancement of the local symmetry to @xmath35 . in order to study yukawa couplings in the local setup , we can gain information by just considering the local area around the point of intersection on the surface s @xcite .",
    "the semi - local approach to f - theory assumes that we have a parent @xmath5 gauge theory which is broken by a position dependent vev for an adjoint higgs field @xcite .",
    "all the interactions in the theory are assumed to come from a single @xmath5 point of enhancement . at this point ,",
    "all the matter curves of the theory meet , and the local symmetry group is enhanced all the way to @xmath5 .",
    "as an example , we can take the gut group on s to be su(5 ) .",
    "the breaking of @xmath5 to the gut group occurs as    @xmath36    where the commutant of the gut group inside @xmath5 is called the perpendicular group , and in this case is @xmath37 .",
    "the nature of the matter curves of the theory is found by decomposing the adjoint representation of @xmath5 as follows    @xmath38",
    "this equation shows us that we have twenty four singlet curves ( @xmath39 ) , five 10 curves , and ten @xmath40 curves .",
    "the equations of these curves can be written in terms of the weights @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , of the 5 representation of @xmath37 as follows    @xmath44    in general , there are non linear relations between the @xmath41 and the coefficients of the elliptic fibration , which have the effect of identifying some of the @xmath41 .",
    "the way in which the @xmath41 can be identified is determined by the monodromy group @xcite . as we are working in the semi - local picture , the full calabi - yau geometry has been decoupled , and so we must choose the monodromy group by hand . by requiring a tree level top quark yukawa coupling , we need at least a @xmath45 monodromy identifying two of the weights .",
    "this is because we need the @xmath25 coupling to be invarient under the perpendicular u(1 ) symmetries .",
    "as the top and anti - top come from the same 10 representation , they both have charge @xmath41 , and the up type higgs has charge @xmath46 , meaning that to cancel the charges we must have @xmath47 .",
    "this can only be the case for @xmath48 , and so we must have an identification of at least two of the weights . from now on this minimal @xmath45 case will be assumed at all times , and we will identify @xmath49 .    in the model building section of the paper , fields will be labelled by which representations of @xmath0 , so(10 ) and",
    "su(5 ) they transform under , and also their charge under the perpendicular u(1)s , given by the appropriate linear combination of weights , as above .",
    "we can take the gauge symmetry on s to be @xmath0 , @xmath50 or @xmath51 ( although f - theory models with no unification group have also been studied @xcite ) .",
    "starting from @xmath5 , there are three equivalent symmetry breaking chains that can end up with @xmath51 , namely :    @xmath52    as we can see from the above breaking chains , even if we break via @xmath0 or so(10 ) as the gut group , we always end up with an @xmath53 structure , which subsequently breaks down to the standard model .",
    "the only difference between the three pictures is which u(1)s originate from the gut group and which originate from the perpendicular group . throughout this paper",
    ", we will assume that the gut group is broken down to @xmath54 via flux breaking .",
    "there are two types of flux that can be turned on : there are fluxes in the u(1)s from the perpendicular group which preserve the chirality of complete gut representations , and there are fluxes that can be turned on in the worldvolume of the 7-brane which break the gut structure . whenever we utilise flux breaking we end up with splitting equations which tell us the net number of states in a particular representation , for example , breaking su(5 ) down to the standard model by turning on a flux in the hypercharge direction ( as discussed in @xcite ) gives the following equations for the 10 and 5 representations of su(5 )    10= \\ {    llrep.&@xmath55 + n_3,2 ^ 1-n_|3,2 ^ 1&:m_10 + n_|3,1 ^ 1-n_3,1 ^ 1 & : m_10-n + n_|1,1 ^ 1-n_1,1 ^ 1 & : m_10+n +    . & & 5= \\ {    llrep.&@xmath55 + n_3,1 ^ 1-n_|3,1 ^ 1&:m_5 + n_1,2 ^ 1-n_1,|2 ^ 1 & : m_5+n +    .",
    "we can see from these equations that the flux associated with the integer m respects the gut structure , and so is a flux in the perpendicular u(1)s .",
    "the flux associated with the integer n is the hypercharge flux and leads to incomplete su(5 ) multiplets . as this breaking",
    "is due to the hypercharge flux , the integer n is given by the flux dotted with the homology class of the matter curve in question .",
    "as such , we can obtain relations between these n integers ( and similar integers for different fluxes ) by calculating the homology classes of the matter curves . in order to do this ,",
    "the spectral cover formalism is used , and the results are summarised in @xcite .",
    "we start by looking at the model of @xcite ( model 1 ) , which was motivated by the fact that if we build a model based on complete 27s of @xmath0 with no matter coming from the adjoint ( 78 ) representation , we automatically take care of anomaly cancellation . table [ 1 ] shows the model building freedom we have in choosing the m and n integers specifying the flux breaking , and how these choices determine the standard model particle content of the model . here",
    "we make the same choices for the ms and ns as in @xcite and these choices are summarised in table [ 1 ] . in table [ 1 ] , arbitrary numbers of singlets are allowed in the spectrum for now , so that we can calculate the restrictions on these numbers later on .",
    "the final column of table [ 1 ] shows the low energy spectrum of the e6ssm that we want to arrive at by eliminating the required exotics from the previous column , which shows the sm particle content after flux breaking . by comparing the final two columns of table [ 1 ]",
    ", we can see that the exotics which we wish to remove are the vector pairs @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "large masses will be generated for these fields through their coupling to sm singlet fields which acquire large vevs .    from the @xmath0 point of view",
    ", the only @xmath0 allowed trilinear term in the superpotential is @xmath58 .",
    "the vectorlike pairs which we wish to remove from the low energy particle content are those which have components in both the @xmath59 and @xmath60 multiplets . as such ,",
    "they are removed by introducing @xmath61 , an @xmath0 singlet , with couplings : _",
    "3127_t_1= _ 31q+ _ 31(2u^c)(2)+ _ 31d^c+ _",
    "[ 31 ]    if @xmath61 gets a large vev these vector states get large masses as required .",
    "the difference between this case and model 1 @xcite is that in model 1 , @xmath62 also gets a large vev .",
    "this singlet has the following couplings    _ 345_1 = _",
    "34[3d+2h_u][3 + 3h_d]= _ 34[3(d)]+_34[2(h_uh_d ) ] .",
    "[ 34 ]    in the e6ssm , these exotics are light , and so instead of getting a large vev , this singlet now must acquire a tev scale vev .",
    "it needs to be checked that the f and d - flatness constraints are satisfied , and that rapid proton decay is forbidden for the realisation of the spectrum .",
    ".complete @xmath63s of @xmath0 and their @xmath50 and @xmath51 decompositions .",
    "the @xmath51 matter states decompose into sm states as @xmath64 and @xmath65 with right - handed neutrinos @xmath66 , while @xmath51 higgs states decompose as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are exotic colour triplets and antitriplets .",
    "we identify rh neutrinos as @xmath70 .",
    "arbitrary singlets are included for giving mass to neutrinos and exotics and to ensure f- and d- flatness . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the particle spectrum of the f - theory models is summarized in table  [ 1 ] .",
    "the models here may be compared to the f - theory model in @xcite in which the singlets @xmath62 acquired a string scale vev which gave large masses to the exotic states , yielding a low energy theory as in the mssm , which we can call an f - mssm .",
    "the new models here have a singlet spectrum where the new flatness conditions allow the singlets @xmath62 to have small vevs resulting in a light exotic mass spectrum .",
    "in addition the singlets @xmath71 are used to generate electroweak scale effective @xmath12 terms .",
    "five right handed neutrinos , as well as other restrictions on the numbers of certain singlets in the spectrum , are required to make the model consistent with f and d - flatness conditions . if the gauged @xmath8 is broken by flux at the gut scale then we have either the f - mssm as discussed previously or the f - nmssm+ as investigated here , where non - perturbative corrections break all global @xmath6 symmetries via @xmath71 mass terms",
    ". however if the gauged @xmath8 is unbroken then we are led to an f - e6ssm but with the phenomenological differences discussed above .",
    "for example , we emphasise that unification in the f - mssm @xcite may be achieved approximately at the field theory level , since the exotic states occur at high energy and have a small mass splitting , while in the f - e6ssm and f - nmssm+ models discussed here the gauge coupling splitting due to flux in f - theory plays a crucial role .",
    "the three different f - theory models are compared in table [ models table ] .    in order for proton decay to be controlled",
    ", the geometric suppression at the field theory level corresponds to the imposition of a discrete @xmath45 symmetry . to understand",
    "the origin of this geometric suppression would require knowledge of the gut singlet matter curves , which in turn requires a knowledge of the global geometry . from our limited understanding of the global aspects of f",
    "- theory this just corresponds to an assumption about the global completion of the model .",

    "<S> f - theory is a non - perturbative formulation of type iib superstring theory which allows for the decoupling of gravity and for the formulation of gut theories based on the gauge group @xmath0 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we explore f - theory models in which the low energy supersymmetric theory contains the particle content of three 27 dimensional representations of the underlying @xmath0 gauge group , plus two extra right - handed neutrinos predicted from f and d flatness . the resulting tev scale effective theory resembles either the e6ssm or the nmssm+ , depending on whether an additional abelian gauge group does or does not survive . </S>",
    "<S> however there are novel features compared to both these models as follows : ( i ) if the additional abelian gauge group is unbroken then it can have a weaker gauge coupling than in the e6ssm ; ( ii ) if the additional abelian gauge group is broken then non - perturbative effects can violate the scale invariance of the nmssm+ leading to a generalised model ; ( iii ) unification is achieved not at the field theory level but at the f - theory level since the gauge couplings are split by flux effects , negating the need for any additional doublet states which are usually required ; ( iv ) proton decay is suppressed by the geometric coupling suppression of a singlet state , a mechanism peculiar to f - theory , which effectively suppresses the coupling of the exotic charge @xmath1 colour triplet state @xmath2 to quarks and leptons ; ( v ) the @xmath3 decays as a chiral leptoquark with couplings to left - handed quarks and leptons , providing characteristic and striking signatures at the lhc .     * e6 models from f - theory * + james  c.  callaghan@xmath4 and stephen  f.  king@xmath4 , +    @xmath4 _ school of physics and astronomy , university of southampton , _    _ </S>",
