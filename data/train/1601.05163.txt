    "in fact , decoherence is one of the main obstacles for the preparation , observation , and implementation of multi - qubit entangled states .",
    "the intensive work on quantum information and computing in recent years has tremendously increased the interest in exploring and controlling decoherence effects @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of an open quantum system coupled to a bath can be either markovian or non - markovian @xcite .",
    "however in this paper we are concerned with the markovian dyanmics of the system infinite range heisenberg model ( irhm ) coupled to a bath of local optical phonons . in case of markovian processes ,",
    "the environment acts as a sink for the system information ; the system of interest loses information into the environment and this lost information plays no role in the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "although the theory of decoherence has undergone major advances @xcite , yet , there exist many definitions of decoherence @xcite .",

    "the two limiting cases for interaction are spin interactions that are independent of distance and spin chains with nearest - neighbor interactions only . in this work",
    "we consider the extreme case of distance independent interaction among the spins , i.e. , the irhm .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the analytically simpler frame of reference of hard - core - bosons ( hcbs ) rather than that of spins so that the single particle excitation spectrum can be easily obtained and exploited ; we show that the effective hamiltonian even in higher order ( i.e. , greater than second order ) perturbation theory retains the same eigenstates as the irhm when the spins are coupled to local phonons . furthermore , decoherence is studied using the quantum master equation approach @xcite .",
    "our analysis based on markovian quantum master equation shows that the off diagonal matrix elements of density matrix in eigen - basis of irhm do not decay .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the irhm hamiltonian and map the hamiltonian to a hcb model . also in the same section we transform irhm to a polaron frame using a canonical transformation . in section iii , we use second order perturbation theory and with the help of schrieffer - wolf ( sw ) transformation , we derive an effective hamiltonian that commutes with @xmath0 and thus have same set of eigenstates . in section iv",
    ", we use the master equation approach and show that the system does not decohere under markovian approximation .",
    "finally we conclude in section v and make some general remarks regarding the wider context of our results .",

    "we consider two distinct time scales associated with hopping processes between two sites : ( i ) @xmath186 corresponding to either full distortion at a site to form a small polaronic potential well ( of energy @xmath184 ) or full relaxation from the small polaronic distortion and ( ii ) @xmath187 related to negligible distortion / relaxation at a site .",
    "the coefficient @xmath181 corresponds to the typical dominant distortion processes shown schematically in figure [ schemat ] ( a ) with the pertinent typical hopping processes being depicted in figure [ fey1 ] ( a ) . in figure [ schemat ] ( a ) , after the hcb hops away from the initial site , the intermediate states have the same distortion as the initial state .",
    "next , when the hcb hops to its final site there is a distortion at this final site with a concomitant relaxation at the initial site .",
    "hence the contribution to the coefficient @xmath181 becomes @xmath188 .",
    "as regards coefficient @xmath182 , it can be deduced based on the typical dominant hopping - cum - distortion processes depicted in figure [ schemat ] ( b ) which typifies the hopping processes in figure [ fey2 ] ( a ) . in figure [ schemat ] ( b ) , when the particle hops to different sites and reaches finally the initial site , there is no change in distortion at any site .",
    "hence @xmath182 can be estimated to be @xmath189 .",
    "lastly , we obtain the coefficient @xmath183 by considering the typical dominant diagram in figure [ schemat ] ( c ) corresponding to the typical process in figure [ fey3 ] ( a ) . in figure [ schemat ] ( c ) , where the first intermediate state depicts the particle hopping but leaving the distortion unchanged , we get a contribution @xmath190 ; for the next intermediate state , where the hcb returns to the initial site , the initial site has to undergo a slight relaxation ( involving absorbing a phonon so as to yield a non - zero denominator in the perturbation theory ) leading to the contribution @xmath191 ; and lastly , when the hcb hops to the final site , there is a distortion at the final site with a simultaneous relaxation at the initial site thereby producing a contribution @xmath192 .",
    "thus we calculate @xmath183 to be @xmath193 .",
