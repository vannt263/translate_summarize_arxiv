    "combustion of solid fuel in porous medium when air ( or any other gaseous oxidizer ) is injected has multiple applications in nowadays technology such as in self - propagating high - temperature synthesis @xcite , smoldering combustion in normal and microgravity environments @xcite , etc .",
    "the latter papers emphasize on the characteristic properties of smoldering combustion , specifically in microgravity environments where fire safety is of paramount importance . in this paper , we study the case of a dry porous medium , fully saturated by the presence of an oxidizing gaseous mixture in its gas phase , and possibly allowing for both fast drifts and fast combustion ( fast gas - solid chemical reaction ) .",
    "the latter can be measured in the range of dominant peclt and damkhler numbers , which gives rise to dispersion in the proposed system .",
    "the importance of dispersion phenomena in porous media combustion and other engineering applications is well - known in the literature ; see , e.g. , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "thermal dispersion coefficients are calculated for an infinite porous medium by means of the volume averaging method ; see also in this context @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the homogenization method have been applied in the derivation of dispersion coefficients ; see , e.g. , @xcite . however , in the framework of filtration combustion , there is no detailed account of the dispersion effect on the transport parameters , which arises from the strong competition between mass and thermal transport in the presence of chemical reaction .",
    "the reaction - diffusion - flow scenario of interest here can be briefly described as follows : a gaseous oxidizer is brought in by molecular diffusion superposed to a given drift inside a porous medium made of periodic arrangements of pores ; building a skeleton that covers @xmath0 .",
    "the oxidizer reacts with the solid fuel exothermically giving rise to high temperatures that travel further through the porous medium by means of heat conduction .",
    "we target at the upscaling of this combustion scenario , paying particular attention to capturing the effect of the microscopic drift , in the presence of dominant damkhler numbers , on the governing macroscopic ( upscaled ) combustion equations , and specifically , on the structure of the effective thermal and mass dispersion tensors .",
    "the main mathematical difficulties arising in our context are fourfold :    * the non - linearity of the gas - solid chemical reaction ; * the treatment of a coupled system of pdes posed in high - contrasting microstructures ; * the fast drift ; * the coupled evolution system .    in @xmath1 ,",
    "the nonlinearity is the temperature - dependent arrhenius law , which poses a more mathematical difficulty , even in the simple form of a first order chemical kinetics .",
    "we will explore the full nonlinearity of the problem in our analysis by mainly relying on the structural properties of the nonlinearity . however , one possibility of avoiding the nonlinearity in the arrhenius law is to consider its linear approximation as suggested in @xcite ; nevertheless , the working hypothesis for such linear approximations is not so obvious .",
    "we borrow from our previous experience in handling situations like @xmath2 ( see for instance @xcite for the treatment of a related scenario from chemical attack on concrete structures ) and focus on the fast drift @xmath3 , which , at first sight , is an impediment to the classical theory of homogenization and on the new aspect @xmath4 .",
    "we adapt the working technique @xcite to our combustion setting , so that we can deal with the aspect @xmath3 in combination with @xmath4 ; see also @xcite .",
    "we foresee possible extensions to our approach , which is capable of handling locally periodic coverings of @xmath0 ; considerations on the bounded domain case being however out of reach for the moment . due to finite+size",
    "effects , localizations of both heat and concentration seem unavoidable , at least for naive scalings , see e.g. @xcite for evidence of localization in a scalar case .    the formal homogenization procedure of this combustion setting as well as extensive multiscale numerical simulations will be reported elsewhere . in a forthcoming publication",
    ", we will also look into the case when liquid islands are initially present in the porous medium , which typically occurs in coal gasification or in - situ combustion in oil recovery , see e.g. @xcite .    we describe the geometry of the porous medium in section [ filtration - model ] , while section [ scaling ] contains the essence of our scaling arguments .",
    "the model equations are listed in section [ micro - pb ] .",
    "the main result of this paper is a set of upscaled equations and effective coefficients ( for the heat capacity , transport and chemical reaction ) , summarized in theorem [ mr ] and reported in section [ main - result ] .",
    "the proof of this result is shown in section [ proofmr ] .",
    "basic modeling considerations in combustion can be looked up , for instance , in @xcite and references cited therein .",
    "the pore scale description of the studied filtration model , which we refer to in this framework , has been previously introduced in @xcite .",
    "we recall here only the main ingredients of the model formulation .",
    "we consider an infinite porous medium @xmath5 made up of a solid phase ( a simple material ) that occupies a region @xmath6 and a gas phase ( saturated with an incompressible fluid containing a gaseous mixture that occupies a gaseous region @xmath7 ) .",
    "the velocity of the fluid is assumed to be known and independent of the macroscopic space variable @xmath8 and time variable @xmath9 .",
    "the flow field satisfies a non penetrating condition on the gas - solid interphase @xmath10 .",
    "we also assume that the gaseous mixture does not penetrate the solid part of the medium consisting of distributed inclusions of a reactive solid fuel , but chemically reacts with the solid at the gas - solid interphase . here , in the simple model , we do not incorporate any kinetic model for the solid fuel , but we are however involved with a heterogeneous chemical reaction between the solid fuel and the gaseous oxidizer .",
    "the thermal conductivity and molecular diffusion tensors satisfy @xmath11 emphasizing , in this way , the contrast between the gas and solid phases . following the same line ,",
    "the velocity field and the volumetric heat capacities in the porous medium can be written as @xmath12 let the temperature in the whole domain @xmath13 be denoted by @xmath14 and the concentration of the gaseous oxidizer being transported by the fluid in the gas phase be denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , we decompose @xmath14 in the two subdomains as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represents the temperatures in the gas phase and solid phase , respectively . depending on the situation , it is sometimes convenient to work with the temperature @xmath14 , while at some other times the use of _ two temperatures _ is more convenient .",
    "denote by @xmath19 the final time of the combustion process .",
    "the balance of heat and mass transport in the porous medium is given by two convection - diffusion - like equations posed in @xmath7 and a heat conduction equation in @xmath6 , viz .",
    "@xmath20 the system is coupled at the gas - solid interphase according to the following flux balances : @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the heat release and @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 is a first - order arrhenius kinetics with a pre - exponential factor @xmath25 and an activation temperature @xmath26 .  the form of agrees with a constant solid fuel assumption .",
    "we assume the continuity of temperature across the interface .",
    "now , we describe the structure of the porous medium of interest .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 is an @xmath28-periodic unbounded open set of @xmath29 which is subdivided into a periodic distribution of cells @xmath30 , with each cell being equal and defined up to a scaled translation of a reference unit cell @xmath31 .",
    "the unit cell consists of two distinct parts - a gas - filled part and a solid part .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 , the solid part of @xmath31 having a smooth boundary denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the gas - filled part is a smooth connected open set defined by @xmath34 we denote the collection of the periodically distributed solid parts by @xmath35 and thus the periodically distributed boundaries is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the the ensemble of the periodically translated solid parts , the matrix of connected gas - filled parts and the ensemble of the solid boundaries can be written as @xmath37    for the @xmath28-periodic representation of the porous medium , we assume that all involved physical parameters and functions are rapidly oscillating .",
    "that is , for a given function @xmath38 , one may write @xmath39 , for all macroscopic variable @xmath40 with @xmath41 representing the microscopic variable . we also assume that the function @xmath42 and physical parameters can be extended by @xmath31-periodicity to the whole @xmath0 ( with a period length @xmath28 ) .",
    "thus , the triplet ( @xmath43 ) can be written as ( @xmath44 ) , pointing out this way the dependence of the solution vector on the @xmath28-changes in the domain .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a rigorous mathematical description of the geometry of the ( periodic ) porous media . without loss of generality",
    ", we will sometimes use throughout the paper @xmath45 for the functions and parameters defined as in , and .",
    "similar representations also hold for their counterparts defined in @xmath27 . in a slight abuse of notation , we will in particular refer to @xmath46 , instead of @xmath47 , as the extended velocity field when dealing with problems defined in the domain @xmath27 .",
    "we also use the notation , @xmath48_{\\gamma } = $ ] , to represent the jump of a function , that takes values in the gas - filled region and solid region of the domain , across the boundary @xmath33 and by @xmath49 , the restriction of the function @xmath38 on @xmath33 .      prior to performing the homogenization procedure ,",
    "we normalize the system of governing equations as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the procedure leads to a couple of important dimensionless parameters . to obtain them ,",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables as follows : @xmath50 where the subscript @xmath51 denotes some constant characteristic quantity and the asterisk @xmath52 denotes the corresponding dimensionless variable .",
    "we point out that similar characteristic quantities must be introduced for all physical quantities entering the equations , i.e. for any generic physical quantity @xmath38 , the normalization scheme is given as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is some characteristic value of interest .",
    "the dimensionless parameters are derived from these characteristic quantities and are estimated in terms of orders of magnitude in @xmath28 ;  see @xcite .",
    "various choices of the estimates usually lead to different forms of the limit problem after the asymptotic procedure as @xmath55 .",
    "the equations in their dimensionless forms can be written as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 the problem introduces the following global characteristic time scales : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the _",
    "characteristic global diffusion time scale _",
    ", @xmath60 is the _",
    "characteristic global advection time scale _",
    ", @xmath61 is the _",
    "characteristic global time of conductive transfer _",
    ", while @xmath62 is the _",
    "characteristic global chemical reaction time scale_.    we introduce additionally the following characteristic dimensionless numbers : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the _ thermal diffusivity_.  other dimensionless quantities introduced in eq .   include @xmath65 , the ratio of _ characteristic time of conductive transfer to the characteristic time scale of the observation _",
    ", @xmath66 is the _ ratio of heat capacities _ , @xmath67 is the ratio of _ heat conductivities_.  we take the time of conductive heat transfer in the subdomain , @xmath68 , as the characteristic time of the observation at the macroscopic scale , i.e. @xmath69  the characteristic temperature of the combustion product is given by @xmath70 so that @xmath71 is the dimensionless activation temperature . to simplify the setting when passing to the homogenization limit , we assume that the constituents have heat capacities of the same order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath72 since @xmath73",
    ", it follows that @xmath74 .",
    "the lewis number is considered in a regime in which the time of diffusion is comparable to the time of conductive heat transfer , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "we study a problem for which the constituent conductivities are of the same order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "the regimes of interest are as follows : @xmath77 note that , in principle , the asymptotic homogenization procedure can be performed ( at least formally ) for other combinations of scalings in terms of @xmath28 . however , when the pclet and damkhler numbers are not balanced , then the validity of our starting model ( [ dimless ] ) is restricted .",
    "for instance , high pclet numbers in combination with moderate damkhler numbers are prone to turbulence regimes ( compare @xcite ) , while high damkhler numbers with moderate pclet numbers most likely facilitate the occurrence of flames . in both such cases ,",
    "the microscopic model has to be changed essentially . in one case ,",
    "it becomes a system of stochastic partial differential equations , while in the other case the model stays at the deterministic level of description , but must include information about the _ a priori _ unknown position and velocity of the flames .      in this paper , we only study the fast regime , i.e. we focus on situations in which both the pclet and damkhler number are dominant . in other words ,",
    "we assume ( in line with @xcite ) that @xmath78 taking into account and considering all the other parameters of the order of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath28 , we rewrite , after dropping the ( @xmath80 ) and obtain the following microscopic problem : @xmath81 we refer to this system of equations as problem @xmath82 .",
    "interestingly , performing in the dimensional model ( [ dimless ] ) the change of variables @xmath83 and @xmath84 leads to the same scaling in @xmath28 as it is shown in ( [ eqmicro ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath85 the time interval of observation of the combustion process with @xmath86 , the final time .",
    "we take into account the following assumptions on the model parameters :    * @xmath87 ; * the velocity field @xmath88 is periodic , bounded and divergence free , i.e. @xmath89 is @xmath31-periodic , @xmath90 , @xmath91 in @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; * the initial data are non - negative , i.e. , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 . *",
    "the nonlinear function @xmath97 is monotonic and positive .",
    "a direct consequence of @xmath98 is the following exponentiation property : @xmath99 +   and its first derivative and exponentiation property given by . ]",
    "the assumptions @xmath100 and @xmath101 are physically motivated in the sense that heat capacities , heat conductivities and diffusion coefficients for isotropic materials are strictly positive real constants .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath102 is a mathematical restriction which strongly delimits the applicability of the method .",
    "for instance , note that if the velocity field @xmath46 would come from the background fluid satisfying the compressible navier - stokes equations , then it would automatically depend on both variables @xmath8 and @xmath103 and hence this approach would not be applicable anymore in a straightforward fashion ; see also remark 2 in @xcite .",
    "assumption @xmath98 is a generally accepted form of the non - linearity in the combustion engineering community .",
    "we introduce the function space @xmath104 to work with the equivalent concept of solution as stated in the next definition .",
    "[ x1 ] assuming @xmath98 , the couple ( @xmath105 ) is called a weak solution to @xmath82 if for all @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the following identities hold @xmath108 @xmath109 for all test functions @xmath110 .",
    "[ apriori ] let @xmath111 be a weak solution to and and assume @xmath100@xmath98 .",
