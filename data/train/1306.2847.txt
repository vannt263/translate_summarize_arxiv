    "in recent papers  @xcite a simultaneous description was proposed of charge radii and electric monopole transitions of nuclei in the rare - earth region .",
    "the purpose of the studies was to examine to what extent a purely collective interpretation of nuclear @xmath0 levels is capable of yielding a coherent and consistent picture of both properties .    in this contribution",
    "a further correlation is proposed between both of the above properties and summed m1 strength as observed in even - even nuclei .",
    "the framework used to establish this correlation is the interacting boson model ( ibm ) of arima and iachello  @xcite which describes nuclear collective excitations in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons with angular momenta @xmath3 and 2 , respectively .",

    "( [ e_r2 ] ) , @xmath11 , is the square of the charge radius of the core nucleus .",
    "the second term accounts for the ( locally linear ) increase in the charge radius due to the addition of two nucleons .",
    "the third term in eq .",
    "( [ e_r2 ] ) stands for the contribution to the charge radius due to deformation .",
    "it is identical to the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite but for the factor @xmath12 .",
    "this factor is included here because it is the _ fraction _",
    "@xmath13 which is a measure of the quadrupole deformation ( @xmath14 in the geometric collective model ) rather than the matrix element @xmath15 itself .",

    "to test the relation between charge radii and e0 transitions , a systematic study of even - even isotopes from ce ( @xmath32 ) to w ( @xmath33 ) was carried out in ref .",
    "the analysis required the knowledge of structural information concerning the ground and excited levels to which an hamiltonian is adjusted .",
    "a general one- and two - body hamiltonian is taken with six parameters which are constant for a given isotope series , except one which is allowed to vary with valence neutron and proton numbers .",

    "the largest peaks in the isotope shifts occur for @xmath38sm , @xmath39gd , and @xmath40dy , that is , for the difference in radii between @xmath41 and @xmath42 isotopes .",
    "the peak is smaller below @xmath43 for ce and nd , and fades away above @xmath44 for er , yb , hf , and w.",
    "it is known from the work of ginocchio  @xcite that the summed m1 strength from the ground state to the scissors mode ( for a review on the latter , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is related to the ground - state matrix element of the @xmath2-boson number operator @xmath7 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the number of neutron ( proton ) bosons and the sum is over all possible @xmath48 states characterized by the label @xmath49 .    to establish a connection between summed m1 strength and isotope shifts ,",
    "one rewrites the relation  ( [ e_bm1 ] ) as follows : @xmath50 the rewritten relation is such that all @xmath51-dependent quantities ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath6 and @xmath46 ) are shifted to the left - hand side of the equation , except for the factor @xmath12 which precisely coincides with the @xmath51 dependence as it appears in the definition of the isotope shifts  ( [ e_ips ] ) .",
    "the tilde in @xmath52 is used as a reminder that it is not the summed m1 strength but rather the summed m1 strength weighted by an @xmath51-dependent factor .",
    "one now defines the difference @xmath53 the quantity between brackets on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e_bm1d ] ) is precisely the one that occurs in the expression  ( [ e_ips ] ) for the isotope shift and hence the following relation is established : @xmath54    this relation is different from the one proposed by heyde _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which correlates summed m1 strength and charge radii themselves .",
    "this has two drawbacks : ( i ) the quantity @xmath11 , which appears in the operator  ( [ e_r2 ] ) , is ill determined and ( ii ) charge radii are not that well known as their differences ( isotope shifts ) .",
    "the relation  ( [ e_bm1ips ] ) is model dependent since it involves the coefficient @xmath8 which can not be neglected ( it represents an important part of the isotope shift ) and which varies from one isotope series to another .",
    "nevertheless , with the values for @xmath8 obtained from the isotope shifts ( see sect .",
    "[ s_dr2 ] ) , the relation  ( [ e_bm1ips ] ) can be tested in the rare - earth region .",
    "the slope in the correlation plot depends on the constants @xmath9 and @xmath55 .",
    "the former is known from the isotope shifts while the latter can be obtained by adjusting the expression  ( [ e_bm1 ] ) to the observed summed m1 strength in rare - earth nuclei  @xcite , leading to @xmath56  @xmath57 .    ) between differences of summed m1 strength in neighboring isotopes and isotope shifts .",
    "the summed m1 strength is taken from ref .",

    "the resulting correlation plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_bm1r2 ] .",
    "two compilations exist of the observed summed m1 strength , one by pietralla _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and a second by enders _ et al . _",
    "they give broadly consistent results and hence lead to similar correlation plots .",
    "the latter , more recent compilation is taken here .",
    "large error bars on both quantities preclude at the moment a conclusive test of the proposed correlation .",
    "in addition , there is an uncertainty ( not included in fig .",
    "[ f_bm1r2 ] ) associated with the coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "the large errors follow from poorly determined isotope shifts ( _ e.g. _ , in dysprosium ) but also because _ differences _ of summed m1 strength should be considered and not the summed m1 strength itself .",
    "an alternative strategy , to be explored in the future , is to use the relation  ( [ e_bm1ips ] ) to fix the coefficients @xmath8 from the experimental summed m1 strength and use the resulting values in the calculation of nuclear radii .",
    "the relation  ( [ e_bm1 ] ) has been generalized to summed m1 strength from an arbitrary state to the scissors mode built on top of that state  @xcite ,    @xmath58    where the initial state @xmath59 is excluded from the sum over @xmath49 .",
    "the difference @xmath60    contains the same combination of matrix elements of @xmath7 as the one that appears in the isomer shift  ( [ e_ims ] ) , and therefore the following relation is established : @xmath61 some isomer shifts are known in the rare - earth region ; the data are more than 30 years old and often discrepant .",
    "nothing is known about m1 strength built on excited states .",
    "the relation  ( [ e_bm1ims ] ) therefore remains untested .",
    "the e0 operator is directly proportional to @xmath7 , unlike the charge radius operator which involves additional terms which complicate the relation between the summed m1 strength and charge radii , as shown above . on the other hand ,",
    "the matrix element of @xmath7 appearing in the sum rule  ( [ e_bm1 ] ) is diagonal while a @xmath4 value involves a non - diagonal matrix element of @xmath7 .",
    "a relation between the two matrix elements can nevertheless be obtained in the symmetry limits of the . in particular , in the su(3 ) limit , appropriate for deformed nuclei , the following analytic expressions are found  @xcite : @xmath63^{1/2 } ,                \\nonumber                \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the second @xmath0 level as calculated in the .",
    "it should be pointed out that the beta - vibrational state @xmath64 , if it exists at all in nuclei , is not necessarily the observed @xmath65 level since non - collective excitations might occur at a lower energy . from the expressions  ( [ e_su3mes ] )",
    "the ratio of matrix elements can be derived , resulting in the following relation , valid in the large-@xmath6 limit : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the function @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the constant that appears in the radius parameterization @xmath70 . in the su(3 ) limit only one @xmath48 state is excited and only the @xmath71-vibrational state decays by e0 to the ground state , as is indicated in eq .",

    "( [ e_gfun ] ) .",
    "the summed m1 strength is taken from ref .",
    "the slope of the line is determined by @xmath9 , @xmath73 , and @xmath55 , coefficients that are obtained from a fit to radii , e0 and m1 strength . ]",
    "the relation  ( [ e_bm1rho ] ) is valid only in the su(3 ) limit which might jeopardize its use in transitional nuclei .",
    "one may nevertheless attempt to apply it to the entire rare - earth region .",
    "the ratio @xmath74 and the effective charges @xmath75 and @xmath76 are determined from a fit to radii  @xcite . the correlation  ( [ e_bm1rho ] ) can now be tested ( see fig .",
    "[ f_bm1rho ] ) for the eight nuclei in the rare - earth region where both e0 and m1 properties are known ( @xmath77sm , @xmath78gd , @xmath79er , and @xmath80yb ) . the @xmath80yb point is conspicuously off the line which calls for a search for e0 strength in this nucleus .",
    "the @xmath79er point follows from a recent experiment  @xcite where the _ fourth _ @xmath81 level at 1934  kev has been identified as the band head of the @xmath71-vibrational band with a sizable e0 matrix element to the ground state .",
    "this work identified the following three topics for further study .",
    "the analysis of the correlation between summed m1 strength and @xmath4 values should be extended to transitions between @xmath82 states .",
    "secondly , the relation  ( [ e_bm1rho ] ) should be generalized to transitional nuclei .",
    "finally , on the experimental front , there is crying need for precise data on isotope shifts through the shape transition in rare - earth nuclei .",
