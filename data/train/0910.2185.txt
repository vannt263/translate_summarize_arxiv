    "the simulation package namd  @xcite was used for the md simulations , while the graphics package vmd  @xcite was used for visualization and analysis of the simulation results .",
    "the model system representing the anode half - cell is composed of four graphite sheets ( anode ) containing @xmath22 carbon atoms each , two pf@xmath23 ions , and ten li@xmath0 ions , solvated in an electrolyte made of @xmath1 propylene carbonate and @xmath2 ethylene carbonate molecules ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mdsystem](a ) ) .",
    "the graphite sheets were fixed from one side by keeping the positions of the edge carbon atoms fixed .",
    "after energy minimization , the simulations were run at constant pressure using a langevin piston nos - hoover method  @xcite as implemented in the namd software package until the system has reached its equilibrium volume at a pressure of @xmath24 atm and 300  k in the @xmath3 ( constant particle number , pressure , and temperature ) ensemble .",
    "the system s behavior was then simulated for @xmath4  ns ( @xmath25 million steps ) in the @xmath5 ( constant particle number , volume , and temperature ) ensemble .",
    "two observations were made : first , the li@xmath0 ions stayed randomly distributed within the electrolyte , and second , none of the li@xmath0 ions had intercalated between the graphite sheets after @xmath4  ns ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mdsystem](b ) ) .",
    "while the lithium ions do not intercalate within the simulation time given above , it is expected that given enough time they will move towards the graphite sheets and get intercalated . to test whether intercalation is possible in such a model system , one of the lithium ions was positioned between the graphite sheets at the beginning of a simulation , and we observed whether it diffused out from between the sheets .",
    "the lithium ion stayed intercalated , even after @xmath26  ns .    in order for intercalation to occur",
    ", the lithium ion has first to diffuse within the electrolyte until it reaches the graphite electrode .",
    "consequently , faster diffusion would result in faster intercalation and shorter charging time . in order to increase the diffusion of lithium ions in the electrolyte",
    ", we explored a new charging method .",
    "in addition to the charging field due to the fixed charge on the graphite carbons , an external oscillating square - wave field ( amplitude 5  kcal / mol , frequency 25  ghz ) was applied in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the graphite sheets . not only does this additional field increase diffusion , but also some of the lithium ions intercalate into the graphite sheets within an average time of about 50  ns .",
    "figure  [ fig : rmsd ] shows a plot of the root - mean - square displacement of lithium ions as a function of time for a system with and without an applied external field .",
    "the increased diffusion and intercalation indicate that a charging protocol involving an oscillating field may decrease the charging time and possibly increase the battery s power density .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , even the simplest electrosorption systems are extremely complicated .",
    "this complexity means that a comprehensive theoretical description that enables predictions for phenomena on macroscopic scales of time and space is still generally impossible with present - day methods and technology .",
    "( note that md simulations , such as those presented in sec .",

    "therefore , it is necessary to use a variety of analytical and computational methods and to study various simplified models of the solid - liquid interface .",
