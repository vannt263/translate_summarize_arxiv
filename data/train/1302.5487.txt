    "phase retrieval is a topic that is currently extensively researched .",
    "part of the effort is directed towards applications in x - ray crystallography , where the fourier transform dictates the form of the measured quantities from which a signal is recovered @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the magnitudes of the fourier transform need to be complemented by additional information about the signal to make recovery feasible @xcite , for example the magnitudes of the fractional fourier transform @xcite .",
    "it is then a challenge whether the additional measurements can be realized experimentally .",
    "another main motivation for phase retrieval is quantum communication , where quantum states need to be estimated from the relative frequencies of outcomes occurring in quantum measurements @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the abstract question of finding a small number of linear measurements such that their magnitudes characterize a vector in a finite dimensional hilbert space , up to an overall unimodular constant .",
    "in addition , we wish to make the recovery procedure resilient against noise affecting the magnitude measurements .",
    "the central idea is that the redundancy inherent in the frame coefficients , resulting from the linear dependencies among the frame vectors , compensates the loss of information when passing from frame coefficients to their magnitudes .",
    "in fact , in frame theory the notion of redundancy is usually understood to be the number of frame vectors divided by the dimension of the hilbert space . in this paper , we choose the frame vectors in a specific way to recover the vectors , up to a unimodular constant .",
    "we address the following main questions : how small can we choose the size of a frame and still characterize each vector uniquely ? what conditions ensure that the vector can be recovered with a guaranteed accuracy if the measured magnitudes are affected by noise ?",
    "several strategies have been applied to the problem of phase retrieval , for example the reformulation of recovery in terms of the rank - one hermitian @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this was solved with techniques from compressed sensing by rank minimization in an underdetermined system @xcite , or even without rank minimization @xcite . however",
    ", this technique does not specify what redundancy , i.e.  the is sufficient for recovery .",
    "other recovery procedures embed in even higher dimensional spaces by taking more tensor powers of @xmath4 with itself @xcite .",
    "constructions based on expander graphs and the polarization identity give us randomized constructions with an explicit bound on the redundancy @xcite .",
    "however , this is still far from the necessary number of vectors derived from the theory of projective embeddings @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the recovery procedure outlined here assumes that the signal is realized as a complex polynomial of degree @xmath5 . in the absence of noise",
    ", the recovery proceeds in several steps :    1 .",
    "the measured quantities are @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 . using the dirichlet kernel and the polarization identity ,",
    "these are extrapolated to the values @xmath9 and @xmath10 for each @xmath11 in the unit circle .",
    "2 .   from the values of these two functions on the unit circle we determine moments of the roots of @xmath12 .",
    "the moments determine the polynomial up to an overall unimodular constant .",
    "we investigate how the presence of noise affects each of these steps , and show that under certain conditions , for all sufficiently small @xmath13 , perturbing the measured quantities up to @xmath13 still gives an approximate recovery with an error of order @xmath14 .",
    "this provable stability only extends up to a certain noise level .",
    "numerical experiments show that the domain in which the linear error bound holds extends far beyond this level .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after fixing the notation , we show in section  [ sec : inj ] that a vector , up to a unimodular constant , is determined by a specific choice of @xmath1 measurements . section  [ sec : stab ] establishes criteria for stability of the recovery procedure , complemented with the results of a numerical simulation .",
    "the space of complex polynomials of degree at most @xmath15 is denoted as @xmath16 .",
    "it is equipped with the inner product induced by the lebesgue measure on the unit circle , so @xmath17 have the inner product @xmath18 } p(e^{it } ) \\overline{q(e^{it } ) } dt\\ ] ] where the overbar denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the space of trigonometric polynomials of degree at most @xmath15 , henceforth called @xmath19 , is understood to consist of all linear combinations of complex polynomials and of their complex conjugates .",
    "thus , @xmath16 is the subspace of analytic functions in @xmath19 . on the other hand",
    ", the map @xmath20 takes @xmath21 to a trigonometric polynomial in @xmath19 .",
    "the first question we wish to resolve is at how many points @xmath22 needs to be evaluated in order to determine @xmath23 .",
    "the second problem is that of noisy recovery .",
    "if the measured quantities are perturbed , is it possible to estimate the set accurately ?",
    "the following theorem shows that to determine a polynomial of degree at most @xmath24 up to a unimodular constant , is enough to know its magnitude at @xmath25 points in the complex plane .",
    "an essential ingredient is a result of philippe jaming s @xcite , here the special case for polynomials .",
    "let @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 then it is determined up to a unimodular constant by the values of @xmath28 on two lines @xmath29 and @xmath30 that intersect in an angle @xmath31 .    without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then by the positivity of @xmath28 on @xmath34 , it extends to a polynomial whose roots come in pairs related by complex conjugation . on the other hand ,",
    "the same applies to the extension of @xmath28 from @xmath30 to the complex plane and reflections of its roots about @xmath30 .",
    "now we have a selection principle based on the pairings : we pick as the roots of @xmath35 the intersection of the sets of roots obtained from the two extensions .",
    "if @xmath35 were not determined by this , then it would need to have a root in the symmetric difference of the roots from the two extensions .",
    "however , the symmetric difference is invariant under reflecting first about @xmath29 and then about @xmath30 .",
    "this composition of the two reflections is an irrational rotation , and so if the symmetric difference is non - empty , it gives a dense set of roots in a circle , which means @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 , let @xmath38 be the unit circle as before and @xmath39 with @xmath31 and @xmath40 .",
    "then sampling @xmath41 on @xmath42 equidistantly spaced points @xmath43 of @xmath44 and @xmath45 determines @xmath12 uniquely , up to an overall unimodular factor .",
    "we proceed in several steps :    _ step 1 .",
    "_ given @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the normalized dirchlet kernel @xmath48 , then @xmath49 . by substitution , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52",
    "this means from the values at @xmath42 equidistant points on a circle we can interpolate any trigonometric polynomial of degree at most @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the magnitudes of @xmath9 on @xmath42 equidistant points on @xmath44 determine @xmath9 on the entire circle . because the circles @xmath38 and @xmath44 intersect in @xmath53 and @xmath54 , this also determines the magnitudes of @xmath12 at two of the sample points on @xmath38 .",
    "once the additional magnitudes @xmath45 are obtained , the dirichlet kernel determines the magnitude of @xmath55 on all points in @xmath56 .",
    "_ using the cayley map @xmath57 and the associated polynomial automorphism @xmath58 we map both @xmath38 and @xmath44 to lines @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath12 to a polynomial @xmath59 , and @xmath55 to a trigonometric polynomial @xmath60 . by conformality , the angle between the lines at @xmath61 is the same as the angle between the circles .",
    "however , the tangent vector @xmath62 has an irrational argument , whereas @xmath63 does not , so the two circles intersect with an angle that is an irrational multiple of @xmath64 . by the conformality of the map ,",
    "the same is true for the intersection of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "_ next , we use p. jaming s argument for @xmath59 to show that magnitudes on the two lines uniquely determines @xmath59 , up to a unimodular multiplicative constant @xcite . applying the inverse of the map",
    "@xmath65 , the same applies to @xmath12 .",
    "the recovery procedure we outline below heavily relies on the analyticity properties of the function space .",
    "although an absolute phase can not be measured , we have access to a relative phase such as @xmath66 for some @xmath67 .",
    "if these values were known on the entire unit circle @xmath68 then we could recover @xmath12 , up to an overall multiplicative constant from contour integrals and cauchy formulas as outliend further below .",
    "let @xmath12 be a complex polynomial with @xmath80 roots @xmath81 in the open unit disk .",
    "let @xmath82 define the monic factor of @xmath12 whose roots are precisely the roots of @xmath12 that are inside the unit disk .",
    "given the perturbed moments @xmath83 of the roots such that @xmath84 for some @xmath85 and @xmath86 for all @xmath87 then there exists @xmath88 which only depends on @xmath80 such that @xmath83 uniquely determine coefficients @xmath89 with @xmath90 for all @xmath91 .",
    "if we knew the values of @xmath92 we could recover the actual coefficients using newton s identities , which give the recurrence relation @xmath93 for all @xmath94 from @xmath95 to @xmath80 .",
    "instead we use our approximations @xmath96 to find approximated coefficients @xmath97 using the recurrence relation @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "we inductively show that @xmath100 is @xmath101 . for the base case , by assumption @xmath102 for the inductive step we note that @xmath103 , and if @xmath104 is the set of all combinations of @xmath94 roots of @xmath105 inside the unit disk , then @xmath106 thus , with the inductive assumption that for all @xmath107 , there exists a constant @xmath108 such that @xmath109 , we have @xmath110 thus @xmath111 suffices .",
    "let @xmath112 , with fixed positive constants @xmath113 and @xmath114 such that @xmath115 and @xmath116 for all @xmath11 on the unit circle @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 and @xmath119 with @xmath120 , @xmath71 and @xmath121 with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , then @xmath122 for @xmath91 observes @xmath123 and if @xmath124 then there exists @xmath88 which only depends on @xmath80 such that @xmath82 , the monic factor of @xmath12 whose roots are precisely the roots of @xmath12 that inside the unit disk , has approximate coefficients @xmath125 with @xmath126    note that @xmath127 so by the first lemma we have @xmath128 if we let @xmath80 be the number of roots of @xmath12 inside the unit circle , and we let @xmath86 , the @xmath94th moment of the inner roots of @xmath12 , then the residue theorem gives us that for any integer @xmath129 $ ] @xmath130 if we let @xmath131 then @xmath132 note that @xmath133 . because @xmath120 we have that @xmath134 so rounding @xmath135 gives us @xmath80 .",
    "thus by the second lemma , we can recover an approximation for @xmath136 with approximated coefficients @xmath97 such that @xmath137 .",
    "now re - expressing @xmath138 in terms of @xmath13 gives the desired result .",
    "if @xmath12 satisfies the hypotheses of the previous theorem , and in addition @xmath139 for @xmath77 , @xmath140 for @xmath141 and @xmath142 and if @xmath143 , then using the perturbation with @xmath144 and @xmath145 as above , we can recover an approximation for @xmath146 ( the monic factor of @xmath147 whose roots are precisely the roots of @xmath147 inside the unit disk ) with approximated coefficients @xmath97 such that @xmath100 is @xmath148 as @xmath149 .",
    "first , we note that @xmath150 on @xmath117 .",
    "thus , @xmath151 on @xmath117 .",
    "then because we have @xmath152 on @xmath117 , we also have @xmath153 on @xmath117 .",
    "we also know that @xmath154 , so that @xmath155 on @xmath117 .",

    "note that both of these perturbations are bounded by @xmath160 .",
    "thus , @xmath147 is a complex polynomial that satisfies the requirements of the theorem , with @xmath161 replaced by @xmath0 , @xmath114 replaced by @xmath162 , @xmath13 replaced by @xmath160 , and @xmath163 replaced by @xmath164 .",

    "thus , we just need an approximation for @xmath181 . in terms of the coefficients of @xmath165",
    ", we have @xmath182 note that if @xmath183 is the multiplicity of the @xmath53 root of @xmath165 , then for all @xmath94 from @xmath53 to @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "thus , the coefficients for the @xmath183 highest degree terms of @xmath186 are equal to @xmath53 , and @xmath186 has degree @xmath172 as it should .",
    "note that we can obtain @xmath186 simply by reversing the order of the coefficients of @xmath165 , so our approximated coefficients @xmath97 for @xmath186 are the same approximated coefficients that we obtained in the previous corollary , but in reverse order .",
