    "the uncertain role of hot ( @xmath5 k ) gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and galaxy halos motivates us to seek out highly - ionized tracers in different environments .",

    "two important scientific goals motivate the current observational searches for absorption in the galactic halo , local group , and igm .",
    "first , 6  may help to locate some of the predicted `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim ) thought to hold the 30  40% of baryons not yet accounted for at low redshift ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ; stocke , shull , & penton 2004b ) .",
    "theory predicts that a substantial fraction of the baryons at low @xmath8 are shock - heated to @xmath9 k by gravitational infall into galaxies , groups , and other large - scale structures ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "1999 ) . could reveal the existence and location of some of these `` missing baryons '' .",
    "second , the large _ fuse _ survey of 6  ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 ) suggests that hot gas forms an important component of the milky way halo and/or local group .",
    "searches for near other galaxies could generalize this result .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "1999 ) of large - scale structure predict that the low - redshift igm is approximately equally divided by mass into three distinct phases : gas that has condensed to form stars and galaxies , gas that remains quiescently photoionized in the diffuse igm ( @xmath10  k ) , and hotter gas ( @xmath11  k ) that has fallen into the denser regions of the igm where it is shock - heated and ionized .",
    "the cold , collapsed phase is well - understood from decades of studying galaxies . at low redshift ,",
    "the photoionized phase has been studied extensively by _ hst _ ( bahcall et al . 1993 ; penton , shull , & stocke 2000 ) and found to contain 29 @xmath12 4% of the baryons in the local universe ( penton , stocke , & shull 2004 , and references therein ) .",

    "this survey found 84 distinct high - velocity systems in 102 surveyed extragalactic sightlines .",
    "while some of these highly - ionized clouds trace previously known structures , most do not , and their column densities and ionization conditions are too diverse to have a common origin . instead , sembach et al .",

    "( 2004 ) proposed a combination of photoionized and collisionally ionized models to explain the .",
    "for the without 21 cm emission , they favor a model in which is collisionally ionized in interfaces between a hot ( @xmath14 k ) , extended ( @xmath15 kpc , the distance to the magellanic stream ) galactic halo and cooler infalling material ( fox et al . 2004 ) . in this model , the hvc is an indirect indicator of the hotter gas rather than a major halo component in its own right .",
    "this key result also indicates that regions within 100 kpc of galaxies are fruitful places to search for the signatures of hot baryons participating in the formation and interaction of galaxies .",
    "an alternative location for hot baryons is in the potential wells of galaxy groups , as proposed by mulchaey et al .",
    "intragroup gas in small , spiral - dominated groups is expected to have the right metallicity and temperature to show as a direct signature of hot baryons . although this prediction has yet to be confirmed , shull , tumlinson , & giroux ( 2003 ) found associated with a galaxy group on the sightline to pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "they suggested that this is collisionally ionized in the interface between infalling cool gas and the hot intragroup medium , such that serves as an indicator of the hotter whim gas , as it appears to in the galactic halo .",
    "although the expected signatures of hot , shock - heated igm gas have been identified in qso absorption lines , their connection to galaxies is still largely unknown .",
    "correlations between galaxies and ly@xmath16 clouds have been described in a statistical sense ( lanzetta et al .",

    "the locations of ly@xmath16 clouds ( the warm phase ) and the whim relative to galaxies can be examined at a phenomenological level with numerical simulations ( dav et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , observational evidence linking ly@xmath16 clouds and the whim to galaxies or large - scale structure is rare , owing to two technical barriers to large samples .",
    "first , obtaining high - resolution qso spectra that cover all interesting igm absorption lines is difficult .",
    "second , these studies often must observe only the uv - brightest targets , which are usually selected without regard to the foreground galaxy populations .",
    "this factor entails intensive galaxy field surveys to follow up the spectroscopic studies .",
    "both the high - quality spectra and complete galaxy redshift surveys are necessary to draw causal connections between igm absorbers and galaxies .",
    "once obtained , the data often yield inconclusive results on the origin of the absorbing material owing to line blending or insufficient column - density sensitivity .",
    "thus , even though some igm material shows evidence of influence from galaxies ( generally metal enrichment ) , it is difficult to relate absorbers to individual galaxies or the large - scale structure in any general way . while most low column density ly@xmath16 absorbers are plausibly related to large - scale structure ( penton et al .",
    "2002 ; rosenberg et al .",
    "2003 ) , a compelling case for individual cloud / galaxy associations can be made for only a few of the strongest ly@xmath16 absorbers ( for example , 3c  273 , stocke et al .",
    "2004a and pks 2155 - 304 , shull , tumlinson , & giroux 2003 ) .    in this study , we examine two strong , -bearing igm absorption - line systems toward pg  1211 + 143 and analyze their connections to galaxies . with @xmath17 m  at 15,300 km  s@xmath2  and @xmath18 m  at 19,300 km  s@xmath2 , these systems are among the strongest ly@xmath16 absorbers at low redshift ( penton , shull , & stocke 2004 ) .",

    "we compiled the available galaxy redshift data on the pg  1211 + 143 field to enable detailed comparisons between the igm absorption - line systems and nearby galaxies ( table  [ galtable ] ) .",
    "the galaxy redshifts are drawn from the approximately 600,000 galaxies in the revised center for astrophysics redshift survey ( huchra et  al .",
    "1992 ; march 2004 version ) and the several hundred galaxy redshifts near bright qso sightlines obtained by mclin ( 2002 ; see also stocke et  al .",

    "the combination of these galaxy catalogs provides a pencil - beam redshift survey that is complete to @xmath42 = 15.5 for arbitrarily large impact parameter and to @xmath42 = 19 for a 2.5@xmath43 impact parameter to pg  1211 + 143 . while the former magnitude limit , based on the cfa redshift survey , is a standard zwicky blue - band magnitude , the deeper survey utilized red magnitudes corrected to @xmath42 by assuming @xmath44 ( similar to an scd galaxy ) .",
    "this conservative color assumption ensures that the quoted magnitude limit is appropriate for even quite blue galaxies .",

    "an angular separation of @xmath46 corresponds to 1.2 @xmath3 kpc and our magnitude limit corresponds to a @xmath47 galaxy .",
    "therefore , we do not believe that we would have missed a galaxy at this limit or brighter because it was obscured by the qso itself . at an impact parameter of @xmath48 , a much higher @xmath23 ( ) absorber ( i.e. , a damped ly@xmath16 system )",
    "would be expected because the sightline would intercept the gaseous disk in this case ( see e.g. , bowen , tripp , & jenkins 2001 ) .",
    "the galaxy field is pictured in figure  [ pgmap ] , and the galaxies lying within @xmath49 km  s@xmath2  of the two absorber complexes are listed in table  [ galtable ] .",

    "we have extended the stocke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) search for associated faint galaxies to the east and south of pg  1211 + 143 but have not discovered any additional galaxies at 15,300 or 19,300 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , the associated galaxies appear to be confined to the northwest of pg  1211 + 143 . in   4 we consider the possible connections between these galaxies , the group , and the absorbers in the pg  1211 + 143 sightline .",
    "in this section , we construct models for the pg  1211 + 143 absorption - line systems using a combination of photoionization equilibrium ( pie ) and collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) models .",
    "we break down the observed absorption profiles into individual velocity components , which are fitted separately but simultaneously . in some cases",
    "we allow these fits to be guided by expectations from modeling .",
    "we then regroup these components according to their common characteristics ( e.g. , ionization stage , linewidth , etc . ) and analyze the groups as single systems .",
    "the grouped component systems are labeled in tables  [ 15table ] and [ 19table ] and include column - density limits on additional species when they constrain the models .",
    "the proper interpretation of these complex absorption - line systems proceeds here in a three - step process . in the first step , we use the measured column densities , limits , linewidths , and relative velocities to diagnose the physical conditions indicated by the observed absorption . for our study , this means distinguishing pie gas from cie gas , and determining the physical conditions for each .",
    "the second step is the phenomenological step , in which we place these underlying physical processes in their proper context .",
    "for example , hot -bearing gas can arise in shocks , turbulent mixing layers , or conductive interfaces  physically distinct origins that produce with the same underlying physical process ( ionization by thermal electron collisions ) .",
    "the third step in the interpretation is the selection of the phenomenological explanation that best fits the available information into a single physical picture . for example",
    ", we might argue that the arises in material ejected from the nearby galaxies and shocked against photoionized ly@xmath16 forest gas in the galaxy s extended gaseous halo .",
    "the first two steps are carried out in this section . in   4",
    ", we generalize the results derived here and discuss the possible causes of the systems , including galactic infall and outflow and hot - igm models .",
    "we model these absorbers with single - phase pie and cie models constructed using the cloudy code ( version 94.00 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) . for pie , we assume that the gas is optically thin to an extragalactic ionizing background with spectral shape from shull et al .",
    "we normalize this extragalactic ionizing background to a specific intensity @xmath56 erg  @xmath24  s@xmath2  hz@xmath2  sr@xmath2 at 1 ryd .",
    "the measured value of @xmath57 is thought to be of order unity at @xmath58 ( shull et al .",
    "1999 ; tumlinson et al .",
    "1999 ) . with a fixed radiation field , a variation in the photoionization parameter ( @xmath59 ) represents a variation in the density @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "thus , for a given range in @xmath62 , we state a corresponding range in density and line - of - sight extent for the gas , assuming @xmath63 , with the caveat that these quantities are directly and inversely proportional to the actual value of @xmath57 .",
    "we also vary the metallicity ( @xmath64 ) by scaling all heavy - element abundances relative to their solar values with a uniform scale factor .",
    "we then constrain the properties of the models to be compatible with all absorption - line measurements and limits associated with that velocity component .",
    "the quoted temperatures for model clouds are derived self - consistently within cloudy for each value of @xmath62 and @xmath64 . for cie , we use cloudy to calculate ion ratios as a function of temperature , ignoring radiation . we assume the updated solar abundances of carbon ( c / h = @xmath65 ; allende prieto et al .",
    "2001a ) and oxygen ( o / h @xmath66 ; allende prieto et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "the conclusions we draw about the physical origins of these absorbers contain the implicit assumption that the gas is in either pie or cie . because we consider only these mechanisms , the uncertainties in the physical state of the detected gas correspond only to the formal uncertainties in these models .",
    "there are other ionization mechanisms that may be able to produce the detected absorption , but which are much more difficult to constrain with the available information .",
    "one such mechanism is non - equilibrium collisional ionization ( shull & mckee 1979 ; shapiro & moore 1976 ) , in which the gas possesses either enhanced high- or low - ionization states for its temperature .",
    "such a model is difficult to constrain , and difficult to pursue for these absorbers .",
    "we can not know whether the non - equilibrium gas was shocked to higher ionization , with a transient excess of low ions , or has recombined from a higher ionization state , with a transient excess of high ions .",
    "with such ambiguity we would not be able to connect the physical state of the gas to explanations for its origins , as we do for pie and cie in   4 .",
    "also , the transient states associated with non - equilibrium collisional ionization are brief , so it is unlikely that all these absorbers would lie in such a state .",
    "we consider non - equilibrium ionization to be a possibility , but one which can not be suitably tested against the data .      the absorption - line system at 15,300 km  s@xmath2  shows a remarkably complex structure for a ly@xmath16 cloud . with profile",
    "fitting informed by reasonable inferences from photoionization models , we have identified eight distinct absorption components associated with the broad ly@xmath16 ( 1130 m  total equivalent width ; penton et al .",
    "2004 ) , six of which show metal - line absorption .",
    "these appear in table  [ 15table ] as a , b , b * , c , c * , and the component ( the asterisks denote that the component has the same velocity but higher ionization than its counterpart ) .",
    "blending is severe in components b , b@xmath67 , c , and c@xmath67 , so we often fit more than one of them as a single component .",

    "the column density limits on metal lines do not provide a meaningful metallicity limit for this system .",
    "the weak component e ( 15,570 km s@xmath2 ) appears only in ly@xmath16 and has @xmath23 ( ) too low for a meaningful metallicity limit to be determined .",

    "still higher lyman series lines are too weak to give useful information or are inaccessible due to blending , which is severe in the _ fuse _ sic2 channel below 1000  .",

    "if we include an additional component with @xmath81 ( ) = 14.5 and @xmath96 km  s@xmath2  in the fit to ly@xmath30 , we find that it has minimal impact , within the 1@xmath31 errors , on every component but the highly uncertain component a. the quoted error for component a has therefore been increased from 0.05 to 0.10 dex to compensate .",

    "a sightline that follows a chord through a roughly spherical object should show less dispersion than a more central sightline .",
    "the second uncertainty with an intragroup origin is that the 19,300 km  s@xmath2  system shows two similar components in the absence of a spiral - rich group .",
    "thus , even if the intragroup medium picture suggested by mulchaey et al .",

    "the factor of five discrepancy in pressure between the two components could be erased by uncertainty in any of the fiducial scaling parameters used in this calculation .",
    "however , the component a cloud size of 180  400 kpc would be difficult to accommodate within a hot intragroup medium of mpc scale . the large photoionized component could still be a chance superposition near but outside the group without negative implications for the group model .",

    "the only factor in our data that casts significant doubt on the intragroup medium model at 15,300 km  s@xmath2  is the presence of a similar multi - phase ly@xmath16/ absorber at 19,300 km  s@xmath2 , where there is no evidence of a spiral - dominated group .",
    "this qualitative discrepancy is difficult to reconcile with the intragroup medium model for the 15,300 km  s@xmath2  system .",
    "in fact , the similarity between the 15,300 km  s@xmath2  and 19,300 km  s@xmath2   absorbers makes it difficult to argue that the nearby group exerts any influence at all on the absorption complex at 15,300 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , we find the hot intragroup medium to be a viable model until additional evidence is available ( although it begs the question of the origin of the metals ) .",
    "a variant of the intragroup medium model was proposed by shull , tumlinson , & giroux ( 2003 ) for the absorber complex at @xmath324 17,000 km  s@xmath2  in the pks 2155 - 304 sightline .",
    "they proposed that the two components arise in warm photoionized gas shocked against the hot intragroup medium filling the group potential .",
    "this model is consistent with our findings for the physical conditions in the 15,300 km  s@xmath2  system , but it is not unique in light of the 19,300 km  s@xmath2  system .",
    "if it is accurate , it suggests that may serve as a signpost of the true whim , which could be verified by x - ray observations of , , and other species .",
    "we have identified high - metallicity , photoionized material that appears to have a recent connection to nearby galaxies .",
    "we also find components with velocity separations that suggest they trace the post - shock regions of a strong shock against the photoionized gas .",
    "however , connecting the to the galaxies may extend the chain of inference too far . as discussed in   4.4 and   4.6",
    "there is circumstantial evidence that these absorbers are at least associated with the same large - scale structure that formed the nearby galaxies , if not with the galaxies themselves . for a single sightline of @xmath325 , two pairings of igm absorbers with galaxies at @xmath326 kpc",
    "are extremely unlikely if they are random ( even more so in light of the pks  0405 - 1219 case , see   4.2 ) .",
    "these absorbers also have stronger ly@xmath16 than expected from the penton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) correlation of ly@xmath16 equivalent width with @xmath259 .",
    "unfortunately we lack the necessary information ( see   4.6 and stocke et al .",
    "2004a ) to establish firmer grounds for causal relationships .",
    "however , if these two systems and the pks  0405 - 1219 clouds reside in filaments or intragroup medium and are not associated with unseen satellites , their high level of metal enrichment is surprising .",
    "at least one component in each of the pg  1211 + 143 absorber complexes exhibits metallicity @xmath327 , and the highly - ionized has 2 - 6 % solar metallicity .",
    "here we estimate how much continuous star formation it takes to generate @xmath328% solar metallicity over the relevant range of physical scales .",
    "we present two versions of the estimate .",
    "first , we scale the estimate to the peak cosmic sfr density from all sources over 1 gyr .",
    "second , we scale to a milky way - like sfr ( @xmath329 yr@xmath2 ) over a 150 kpc region .",
    "both calculations assume a mass yield in metals of @xmath330 for every @xmath286 formed into stars , and a baryon density @xmath331 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "first , we estimate the total metal enrichment from all galaxies in time @xmath332 t@xmath333 , scaled to the peak cosmic sfr density , @xmath334",
    ". then the igm metallicity is given by : @xmath335 t_9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath336% solar metallicity can be achieved in the igm if star formation proceeds for 1 gyr at the peak rate of 0.1 @xmath286 yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath337 measured at @xmath338 ( steidel et al . 1999 ; giavalisco et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we can also estimate the metallicity within a volume of radius 150 kpc , such as that probed by the pg  1211 + 143 sightline in the halos of the two nearby galaxies . within a 150 kpc radius , with mean density @xmath339 @xmath61 and mean atomic weight @xmath340 , there is @xmath341 in gas .",
    "a burst of star formation will generate a total mass in metals :    @xmath342\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , the metallicity is : @xmath343 t_9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath217 1 gyr is required to achieve @xmath344% solar metallicity with steady star formation spread over large volumes .",
    "this result suggests that the lower metallicities of the photoionized components may be achieved simply by the gradual buildup of metals from quiescent star formation over 1 gyr .",
    "these absorbers are therefore not necessarily associated with any particular galaxy ; they may simply be embedded in large - scale filaments of galaxies , as has been suggested for ly@xmath16 clouds and weak metal - line absorbers ( morris et al .",
    "1993 ; tripp , lu & savage 1998 ; impey , petry & flint 1999 ; penton et al .",
    "such a model does not naturally explain either the multi - phase nature of these absorbers nor the small line - of - sight sizes for some of them .",
    "steady metal enrichment seems insufficient to explain the higher metallicities we see in component c ( 40% solar ) at 15,300 km  s@xmath2  and in a ( 40% solar ) and d ( 90% solar ) at 19,300 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "rigby et al . ( 2002 ) and charlton et al . (",
    "2002 ) have emphasized this high metallicity problem in the context of the `` weak- absorbers '' found in ground - based spectra at somewhat higher redshifts .",
    "these high - metallicity absorbers seem to require a single , metal - enriched unbound galaxy wind , metal - enriched gas tidally stripped from an unseen satellite ( see   4.4 ) , or perhaps , as proposed by rigby et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , they are directly associated with unseen stellar populations . thus the gas metallicities inferred for these multiphase absorption complexes suggest they are related to nearby galaxies .",
    "we have used _ hst_/stis and _ fuse _ to study two multi - component , multiphase igm absorption systems with substantial .",
    "these systems have the following important features , for which any viable physical model must account :    * _ they are multiphase : _ the observed column densities of in these systems are too high to be consistent with photoionization models based on the lower ions , except for a narrow range of parameter space that implies very large ( @xmath217 mpc ) pathlengths together with substantial non - thermal broadening . although pie models can not be excluded conclusively , we believe that most of the arises from collisional ionization in hot ( @xmath345 k ) gas . the detection of - and - together with in these absorbers appears to trace multiphase structures composed of hot collisionally - ionized gas and warm photoionized gas possibly located close together or interacting .",
    "dwarf galaxy outflows and , at 15,300 km  s@xmath2 , intragroup medium models are both viable production mechanisms for the hot ionized gas . *",
    "_ they are metal - enriched : _ we find that all the metal - line systems here are enriched to at least @xmath308% solar , and some have @xmath346% .",
    "the small metallicity may reflect `` pre - enrichment '' by early generations of stars , but the higher metallicities suggest recent enrichment by galaxies by way of outflows or tidal stripping .",
    "* _ they lie near galaxies and groups : _ the discovery of these two multiphase absorbers in close association with galaxies and their resemblance to high - velocity clouds near the milky way ( collins et al .",
    "2004 ; fox et al .",
    "2004 ) provides an important caution , or a critical clue , to the interpretation of absorption in the general igm . as pointed out by sembach et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the _ fuse _ survey of local , it is unwise to interpret the `` igm '' as a single class of absorbers in the absence of detailed galaxy information and/or constraints on lower ionization species . *",
    "_ there is no obvious `` unified model '' : _ the two strong absorption - line systems we study here are quite similar .",
    "both show metal - enriched , multiphase gas , broad , and both lie within @xmath347 kpc of @xmath348 galaxies",
    ". however , they also show significant differences .",
    "one absorber is associated with a spiral - dominated group , while the other exhibits _ two _ strong components .",
    "while we have uncovered two absorbers potentially related to nearby galaxies , there is no statistical evidence that this phenomenon is common .",
    "the number of well - studied systems is far too small to allow reliable conclusions about the general nature of -bearing hot gas near galaxies .",
    "intensive searches in the @xmath349 200@xmath3 kpc regions around galaxies and nearby qso absorbers should be undertaken to determine the extent to which our results and those of sembach et al .",
    "( 2003 ) can be generally applied to theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the dwarf - galaxy outflow model can be tested by deeper galaxy surveys in this field , but the intragroup medium model will require more high - quality data on qso sightlines passing through known galaxy groups .    as discussed by tripp et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for an absorber of similar strength in the sightline to h1821 + 643 , the x - ray lines of and might distinguish the true nature of the hot gas we detect here , if present or future x - ray spectrographs can achieve limiting column densities of @xmath81 ( ) @xmath21 14 .",
    "such a test could eliminate the remaining pie scenarios for the absorbers and better constrain their temperatures .",
