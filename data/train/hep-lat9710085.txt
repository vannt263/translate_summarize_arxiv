    "in @xcite the mass gap measurement in the @xmath2 matrix model was compared with the bethe - ansatz prediction and found to disagree by a factor of four although for the covering group model there was good agreement .",
    "it was concluded that the signal for scaling in the @xmath2 simulation was only apparent and that a true continuum limit had not been achieved .",
    "it was conjectured that the deception was due to vortices , present in @xmath2 but absent in the covering group . here",
    "we investigate whether vortices can cause a bogus signal for scaling in the 2d @xmath0 gauge model which allows an interpolation between the pure @xmath0 and the @xmath1 spin models and which also contains vortices .",
    "we find evidence for the @xmath1 fixed point and for a scaling flow which indicates the presence of a new renormalized trajectory ( rt ) .",
    "we suggest that this rt will cause an apparent scaling signal of the kind reported in @xcite and that it is responsible for an observed cross - over effect .",
    "it has also been conjectured @xcite that in 2d the continuum limit in pure @xmath0 is distinct from that in pure @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite and hasenbusch @xcite have suggested that this conjecture is incorrect and that the continuum limit in the @xmath0 model is controlled by the @xmath1 fixed point .",

    "the action used is s  =  -_,__+ _ ,  +   _ pp ( ) , [ action ] where @xmath3 is a unit length three - component vector at site @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a gauge field on the link @xmath6 taking values in @xmath7 $ ]  . the plaquette of gauge fields is denoted by @xmath8 and vortices reside on plaquettes where @xmath9 .",
    "the pure @xmath1 and @xmath0 spin models correspond to @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "a local update was used comprising a combination of heat - bath , microcanonical and demon schemes .",
    "lattice sizes ranged from @xmath12 to @xmath13 with typically @xmath14 configurations per run .",
    "the simulations were carried out on the hitachi sr2201 computers in the cambridge high performance computing facility and in the tokyo computing centre .",
    "to establish the topology of rg flows we study how the mean values of the spin - spin interaction , @xmath15 , and of the plaquette , @xmath16 , flow under blocking . for a given configuration",

    "we derive a blocked configuration @xmath21 on a lattice of side @xmath22  .",
    "the blocking transformation for the spins is @xmath23 where @xmath24 runs over nearest neighbour displacements from @xmath4 , and @xmath25 was chosen to be 0.0625  . to block the links",
    "the gauge field products were computed for the three shortest wilson paths @xmath26 joining the end points of the blocked link .",
    "the blocked gauge field was assigned the majority sign of the @xmath27  .    for given",
    "coupling constants @xmath28 and given lattice size @xmath29 each configuration was blocked by successive transformations until the blocked lattice was @xmath30 .",
    "the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 were then measured and averaged over all configurations .",
    "this was done for @xmath33 giving a flow segment in the @xmath34 plane with each point labelled by initial lattice size .",
    "the flow can be extended by tuning new couplings @xmath35 so that a_l^(^,^ )  & = &  a_l ( , )  , + p_l^(^,^ )  & = &  p_l ( , )  , [ tune ] for some @xmath20 and @xmath36 . the segment for fixed @xmath35 can then be computed .",
    "these flows result from a projection onto the @xmath28 plane of true trajectories in a higher - dimensional coupling constant space .",
    "the assumption is that only @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to relevant operators and that by blocking the effect of irrelevant variables is minimized .",
    "there is a line of first - order transitions , first reported in @xcite , for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we find that this line of transitions ends at the `` vorticity '' critical point . in figure [ f1 ]",
    "we plot @xmath39 and @xmath40 versus @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the order parameter is the vorticity . the linear combination @xmath43 with @xmath44 shows _ no _ discontinuity in this region .",
    "@xmath45 is closely related to the action , @xmath46 ( eqn . [ action ] ) , and it is reasonable to interpret @xmath45 as the free energy . also , @xmath45 is the correct operator to interpolate the vector state associated with the @xmath1 critical surface where the corresponding correlation length will diverge but which remains _ finite _ at the vorticity critical point .",
    "there is a set of neighbouring flows on which the observables scale .",
    "the example shown in figure [ f2 ] shows that there is a rt in the vicinity which must be associated with a new fixed point . to see that observables scale each flow segment of four points",
    "was successively overlaid using eqn .",
    "( [ tune ] ) with @xmath47 .",
    "for the scaling flows the points of the overlaid flow segments coincide very well within errors .",
    "the flow is consistent with an exponent @xmath48 with critical couplings @xmath49 .",
    "of course , the new fixed point will not lie in the @xmath28 plane and its relationship with the vorticity critical point is unclear .",
    "open questions are : can the continuum limit of the new rt be taken at the vorticity critical point and does there exist a continuum limit with a non - zero vorticity density ?",
    "it is intriguing that the position of the vorticity critical point and the critical couplings deduced from the fit for @xmath50 are very similar .",
    "the nature of the new fixed points needs more investigation .        scaling on the @xmath1 rt ( @xmath51 )",
    "was verified and agreement with the 3-loop perturbative @xmath52function was found after effects due to finite @xmath20 were accounted for using perturbation theory .",
    "the pure @xmath0 model ( @xmath11 ) does not intersect any critical surface except the one controlled by the @xmath1 fixed point at @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this confirms the conjectures of @xcite that @xmath0 and @xmath1 have the same continuum limit . in figure [ f3 ] flow segments for the @xmath0",
    "are shown for various @xmath55 in the range @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "there is a clear cross - over in the blocked vorticity , @xmath58 , as @xmath55 increases through this range .",
    "moreover , the flows to larger @xmath58 renormalize close to the scaling flow , shown in figure [ f3 ] as a dotted line .",
    "hence , for @xmath59 we should expect to see a good signal for scaling induced by the associated new rt .",
    "however , this scaling is not a signal for a continuum limit in @xmath0 but is due to the proximity of the cross - over region to the new fixed point to which it is due . as @xmath55 is increased through the cross - over region scaling will be violated and eventually reappear in association with the true continuum limit controlled by the @xmath1 fixed point .",
    "we believe that this is the origin of the bogus scaling observed in @xcite ."
