    "in 1947 harold wiener @xcite employed the sum of distances between vertices in a chemical graph representing a molecule to explain boiling points of alkanes . later the sum of distances between all vertices in a graph was called the wiener index , which became one of the earliest topological indices .",
    "since then extensive research was performed on revealing connection between different topological indices of molecules and physical , chemical , pharmacological , and biological properties of substances ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and the wiener index appeared to be among the most useful and powerful ones ( see @xcite ) .    for a simple connected undirected graph @xmath0 with the vertex set @xmath1 and the edge set @xmath2 and for any pair of vertices @xmath3 let @xmath4 denote the distance ( the length of the shortest path ) between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in @xmath0 .",
    "then the wiener index of the graph @xmath0 is defined as @xmath7    in 1997 klavar and gutman @xcite suggested a generalization of the wiener index to vertex - weighted graphs .",
    "they endowed each vertex @xmath8 in graph @xmath0 with some weight @xmath9 ( in contrast to integer weights , originally used in @xcite , below we allow for arbitrary non - negative weights ) and defined the _ vertex - weighted wiener index _ ( _ vwwi _ ) for such a graph as    @xmath10    when the weight of each vertex in a graph @xmath0 is equal to the degree of this vertex in @xmath0 , this index is referred to as the _ schultz index of the second kind _ @xcite or the _ gutman index _ @xcite .",
    "one of the typical problems in topological index study is estimation of index value bounds over the certain class of graphs ( molecules ) . in @xcite a tree , which minimizes the wiener index over the set of all trees with",
    "the given maximum vertex degree @xmath11 has been shown to be a balanced @xmath11-tree ( the , so - called , _ volkmann tree _ ) .",

    "have shown independently that the minimizer of the wiener index over the set of trees with the given vertex degrees sequence is the , so - called , _ greedy tree _",
    "it is built in top - down manner by adding vertices from the highest to the lowest degree to the seed ( a vertex of maximum degree ) to keep the tree as balanced as possible .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the results of @xcite to the vertex - weighted trees and show that some generalization of the famous huffman algorithm @xcite for the optimal prefix code builds an optimal tree , which coincides with the greedy tree in case of unit weights .",
