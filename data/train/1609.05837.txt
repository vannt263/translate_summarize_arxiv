    "the standard model ( sm ) , while otherwise phenomenologically successful , fails to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , i.e. the presence of more matter than antimatter .",
    "the necessary ingredients for producing the bau have been listed by sakharov @xcite , and even though they are all present in the sm , including @xmath7 violation , the amount of asymmetry calculated is off by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "therefore , new sources of @xmath7 violation are required to understand the bau , which is measured either with respect to photon density @xmath8 or with respect to the entropy density , @xmath9 see e.g. @xcite for reviews and @xcite for a recent determination of the error .",
    "one possible new source that is rather well motivated within the leptonic sector is leptogenesis @xcite . in simple extensions of the sm that explain the light neutrino masses by adding heavy right - handed ( rh ) majorana neutrinos @xcite , known as the ( type i ) seesaw mechanism , the decays of the heavy neutrinos can lead to a lepton asymmetry which can be converted into the bau by nonperturbative sm sphaleron interactions .",
    "leptogenesis is a generic feature of models with heavy rh neutrinos and seesaw .",
    "whether or not it can explain the bau is a _ quantitative _ problem .",
    "thermal leptogenesis , wherein the initial rh neutrino abundance is assumed zero ( produced instead in the thermal bath ) , is a particularly minimal incarnation of this mechanism .",
    "conventional wisdom when discussing leptogenesis in @xmath0 @xcite suggests that the lightest rh neutrino @xmath3 has a mass that is too low to produce the correct baryon asymmetry . it can be understood as follows : there is a very strong hierarchy in the up - type quark masses , with @xmath10 , while the hierarchy among neutrinos is comparatively mild .",
    "assuming a normal ordering @xmath11 , we have @xmath12 . if up - type quark and neutrino dirac couplings are assumed equal in naive @xmath13 , producing the correct hierarchy in the neutrino majorana masses after seesaw requires a large hierarchy in the rh neutrino masses @xmath14 , like @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath16 is too light for traditional leptogenesis , typically one proceeds by considering @xmath17 leptogenesis @xcite , which has been studied in detail for @xmath13-inspired models @xcite ( for further work on leptogenesis in @xmath13 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the situation can be different in @xmath0 flavour models @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show that @xmath3 leptogenesis is possible in a realistic flavoured @xmath0 susy gut model , involving a flavour symmetry to account for the mass hierarchies and neutrino mass and mixing pattern . as a concrete example",
    ", we estimate the bau arising from leptogenesis in a @xmath18 susy gut model @xcite , which was shown to successfully and accurately fit all quark and lepton mass and mixing parameters , while simultaneously resolving the doublet - triplet splitting problem and demonstrating that proton decay is naturally suppressed well within the current experimental constraints .",
    "it further predicts normal neutrino ordering , and a leptonic dirac phase @xmath19 , in good agreement with current experimental bounds .",
    "the model involves only `` named '' representations of @xmath13 , i.e. the singlet , fundamental , spinor and adjoint representations .",
    "a compelling feature of the model is that the mass matrices in each sector ( including the light neutrinos after the seesaw has been implemented ) have the same universal structure , and the phases and mixing angles in the leptonic sector are guided by the flavour symmetry .",
    "this leads also to a rather predictive scenario for leptogenesis , which ultimately allows to constrain some of the free parameters of the model ( and indirectly , the mass of the rh neutrinos ) in order to obtain the correct asymmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we briefly summarize the model in @xcite . in section [ seesaw ]",
    "we show how the seesaw mechanism is implemented in this model . in section",

    "the non - abelian discrete group @xmath24 is responsible for the flavour structure , was first used as a flavour group in @xcite and more recently in @xcite and references therein . ] while abelian discrete groups @xmath25 work as shaping symmetries and help to give correct flavour structure in the masses .",
    "furthermore , the model is @xmath7 symmetric and renormalisable at high energies ; all nonrenormalisable terms appear after integrating out heavy messenger fields .",

    "two different @xmath0 multiplets are needed to obtain a non - trivial cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "the superfield @xmath28 obtains a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) that breaks @xmath29 and gives majorana masses to rh neutrinos .",
    "@xmath30 breaks @xmath31 and its vev is aligned in such a way that it achieves doublet - triplet splitting through the dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism @xcite .",
    "it also provides the necessary clebsch - gordan coefficients to obtain correct quark masses .",
    "the field @xmath32 breaks @xmath33 completely and provides an explanation for the hierarchy between fermion masses  la froggatt - nielsen .",
    "finally , the @xmath34 superfields are flavons that break @xmath24 and provide the structure of the mass matrices in the so - called csd3 alignment where @xmath35 csd refers to constrained sequential dominance @xcite .",

    "<S> although @xmath0 supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unification theories ( guts ) are very attractive for neutrino mass and mixing , it is often quite difficult to achieve successful leptogenesis from the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath1 due to the strong relations between neutrino and up - type quark yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in a realistic model these constraints are relaxed , making @xmath1 leptogenesis viable . to illustrate this </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xmath2 from flavoured @xmath3 leptogenesis in a recently proposed @xmath4 susy gut . </S>",
    "<S> the flavoured boltzmann equations are solved numerically , and comparison with the observed @xmath2 places constraints on the allowed values of right - handed neutrino masses and neutrino yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the flavoured @xmath0 susy gut is not only fairly complete and predictive in the lepton sector , but can also explain the bau through leptogenesis with natural values in the lepton sector albeit with some tuning in the quark sector .    </S>",
