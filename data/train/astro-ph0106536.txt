    "observations of fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are now providing us with a direct view of the primordial inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations yields a wealth of information on the nature of the primordial perturbations , and the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "mapping the polarization of the cosmic microwave sky is an important next step , offering a great deal of complementary information , especially regarding the character of the primordial inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting questions to resolve is whether the primordial perturbations possessed a tensor ( gravitational wave ) component , as predicted by simple inflationary models . here ,",
    "polarization measurements offer a unique probe  @xcite .",
    "polarization of the cosmic microwave sky is produced by electron scattering , as photons decouple from the primordial plasma .",
    "linear polarization is produced when there is a quadrupole component to the flux of photons incident on a scattering electron .",
    "scalar ( density ) perturbations generate an ` electric ' ( gradient ) polarization pattern on the sky due to gradients in the velocity field on the surface of last scattering . for scalar perturbations",
    "the velocity field is curl - free , and this leads directly to the production of an entirely ` electric ' pattern of linear polarization .",
    "in contrast , tensor perturbations ( gravitational waves ) produce polarization by anisotropic redshifting of the energy of photons through decoupling . in this case",
    "the polarization has ` magnetic ' ( i.e.  curl ) and ` electric ' ( i.e.  gradient ) components at a comparable level .",
    "a magnetic signal can also be produced by weak lensing of the electric polarization generated by scalar modes .",
    "detection and analysis of the lensing signal would be interesting in itself , but a detection of an additional tensor component would provide strong evidence for the presence of primordial gravitational waves , a generic signature of simple inflationary models .    detecting or excluding a magnetic component is clearly of fundamental significance in cosmology .",
    "but there is a significant obstacle to be faced .",
    "the problem is that for the foreseeable future , the primordial sky polarization will only be observable over the region of the sky which is not contaminated by emission from our galaxy and other foreground sources of polarization .",
    "thus we shall only be able to measure the polarization over a fraction of the sky .",
    "but the electric / magnetic decomposition is inherently _ non - local _ , and _ non - unique _ in the presence of boundaries .    to understand this ,",
    "consider the analogous problem of representing a vector field @xmath0 ( in two dimensions ) as a gradient plus a curl : @xmath1 the electric and magnetic components respectively . from this equation",
    ", one has @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . for a manifold without a boundary , like the full sky",
    ", the laplacian may be inverted up to a constant zero mode , and the two contributions to @xmath0 are uniquely determined .",
    "but for a finite patch , one can always think of adding charged sources for the potentials @xmath4 and @xmath5 outside of the patch on which @xmath0 is measured , which alter @xmath4 and @xmath5 without changing @xmath0 .",
    "for example one can add to @xmath4 and @xmath5 pieces with equal but perpendicular gradients so there is no net contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "since full sky observations are unrealistic , so is the hope of a unique decomposition of the sky polarization into electric and magnetic components .",
    "however , this does not at all mean that the hypothesis of a magnetic signal can not be tested .",
    "one possibility is to construct a local measure of the magnetic signal by differentiating the measured polarization ( i.e. @xmath6 vanishes if @xmath0 is pure electric in the analogue example above ) , but this is problematic for noisy , sampled data .",
    "a more promising alternative , which avoids differentiating the data , is to construct line integrals of the polarization  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the vector analogy above , any line integral @xmath7 is guaranteed to vanish if @xmath0 is purely electric . however",
    ", the problem with these line integrals is that there are an infinite number of them , and they are not statistically independent .",
    "one would therefore prefer a set of ` magnetic ' variables to which the ` electric ' component does not contribute , but which are finite in number and statistically independent , for a rotationally symmetric statistical ensemble . since polarization from a primordial scale invariant spectrum of gravitational waves",
    "is predominantly generated on scales of a degree or so ( the angle subtended by the horizon at last scattering ) , we would expect to be able to characterize the cosmic magnetic signal by a set of statistically independent variables roughly equal in number to the size of the patch in square degrees",
    ". however the signal within a degree or so of the boundary can not be unambiguously characterized as magnetic , and hence one loses a number of variables proportional to the length of the boundary .",
    "the amount of information about the magnetic signal therefore increases as the patch area minus the area of this boundary layer . in this paper we shall find the set of observable ` magnetic ' variables explicitly for circular sky patches : the method may be generalized to non - circular patches if necessary .    as mentioned above , the electric component of the polarization ( due primarily to scalar perturbations ) is expected to be much larger than the magnetic signal . therefore to detect the latter it may be useful to construct observables which suffer no electric contamination . we show how to construct such variables , and use them to estimate what magnitude of magnetic signal the planned planck satellite might be able to detect .",
    "we also discuss the optimal survey size for future experiments aimed at detecting tensor modes via magnetic polarization , including the effects of ` magnetic noise ' due to weak lensing of the dominant electric polarization  @xcite . even for observations that do not expect to detect the magnetic signal the magnetic - only observables are likely to be very useful in checking consistency of any residual polarization with noise or indeed in identifying foreground contamination .",
    "they may also be useful for studying the small scale weak lensing signal  @xcite .    to construct variables that depend only on the electric or magnetic polarization",
    "we integrate the polarization field over the observed patch with carefully chosen spin - weight 2 window functions .",
    "we present a harmonic - based approach for constructing these window functions which is exact in the limit of azimuthally - symmetric patches .",
    "the method is expected still to perform well for arbitrary shaped patches of the sky , but the separation will no longer be exact in that case . constructing the window functions with our harmonic method",
    "automatically removes redundancy due to the finite size of the patch , keeps the information loss small ( except for very small patches ) , and ensures that for idealized noise in the polarization map ( isotropic and uncorrelated ) , the noise on the electric and magnetic variables preserves these properties . in this respect the construction is analogous to the orthogonalized harmonics approach used in the analysis of temperature anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "however in the polarized case there is no simple interpretation in terms of a set of orthogonalized harmonics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown how the lossless quadratic estimator technique can be applied to polarization . there , no attempt was made to separate the electric and magnetic contribution to the estimators , so the resulting window functions for the power displayed considerable leakage between the electric and magnetic modes .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed how the leakage could be reduced , but it is arguably still too large to allow robust estimation of the magnetic signal in the presence of an electric signal that is orders of magnitude larger .",
    "we are able to perform a much cleaner separation at the level of the harmonic components in the map , and as we shall see the information loss in our approach is quite small for full sky surveys with a galactic cut .",
    "the electric - magnetic decomposition of the polarization field is exactly analogous to the corresponding decomposition of projected galaxy ellipticities induced by weak lensing  @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows how to construct local real - space correlation functions for measuring the magnetic component .",
    "these are useful for distinguishing the purely electric signal due to gravitational lensing from intrinsic correlations in galaxy alignments , and the method has the advantage of working for arbitrarily shaped regions of sky .",
    "however the method assumed a flat sky approximation , and includes only the two - point information .",
    "for polarization observations the sky curvature will be important and we aim to extract a set of statistically independent observables that contain as much of the magnetic information as possible .",
    "this may also prove useful for weak lensing studies .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ebpol ] we present the spin - weight 2 window technique for separating electric and magnetic polarization on the sphere , generalizing results in refs .",
    "section  [ sec : sep ] describes our harmonic - based technique for constructing window functions with the properties required to ensure separation of the electric and magnetic modes while keeping information loss small .",
    "classical techniques for testing the hypothesis that there is no magnetic signal are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : hyp ] , and estimates of the detection limits with the planck satellite and future experiments are also given .",
    "lossless methods for estimation of the polarization power spectra are contrasted with methods using the separated variables in sec .",
    "[ lossless ] . in a series of appendices we outline our conventions for spin weight functions and their spherical harmonics .",
    "in addition we present a number of the standard integral theorems on 2-dimensional manifolds in convenient spin weight form , and present recursive methods for the fast computation of the spin weight spherical harmonics and their inner products over azimuthally symmetric patches of the sphere .",
    "a further appendix discusses the statistics of detecting weak signals from tensor modes .",
    "the observable polarization field is described in terms of the two stokes parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 with respect to a particular choice of axes about each direction on the sky . in this paper",
    "we take these axes to form a right - handed set with the incoming radiation direction ( following ref .",
    "the real stokes parameters are conveniently combined into a single complex field that represents the observed polarization @xmath10 the values of stokes parameters depend on the choice of axes ; since @xmath8 is the difference of the intensity in two orthogonal directions it changes sign under a rotation of @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath8 field is related to the @xmath9 field by a rotation of @xmath12 .",
    "more generally under a right - handed rotation of the axes by an angle @xmath13 about the incoming direction the complex polarization transforms as @xmath14 and is therefore described as having spin minus two ( see appendix  [ app : eth ] for our conventions for spin weight functions ) .",
    "the analysis of polarized data is therefore rather more complicated than for the temperature which does not depend on making a choice of axes in each direction on the sky .",
    "as described in appendix  [ app : eth ] , one can define spin raising and lowering operators that can be used to relate quantities of different spin  @xcite .",
    "the spin raising operator is denoted @xmath15 and the lowering operator @xmath16 .",
    "since the polarization has spin - weight -2 it can be written as the action of two spin lowering operators on a spin zero complex number @xmath17 the underlying real scalar ( spin - zero ) fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 describe electric and magnetic polarization respectively  @xcite .",
    "they are clearly non - local functions of the stokes parameters .",
    "one can define a spin zero quantity which is local in the polarization by acting with two spin raising operators .",
    "using some results from appendix  [ app : eth ] one obtains @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the covariant derivative on the sphere .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of this equation can therefore be used to determine the electric and magnetic parts of the polarization . performing a surface integral we define @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a complex window function defined over some patch @xmath24 of the observed portion of the sky .",
    "it follows that @xmath25 provide a measure of the electric and magnetic signals .",
    "note that @xmath26 with an equivalent result for @xmath27 . using the integral theorem   in appendix  [ app : eth ] we can write @xmath28 where @xmath29 is now a spin 2 window function",
    ", @xmath30 is a spin @xmath31 window function , and @xmath32 is the spin 1 element of length around the boundary @xmath33 of @xmath24 . clearly we do not wish to take derivatives of noisy observed data and hence it is usually useful to choose the window function to eliminate the derivative terms on the boundary .    for cmb polarimetry",
    "we are interested in the polarization defined on the spherical sky .",
    "the surface integrals vanish if we choose @xmath23 such that @xmath34 , which will be true if @xmath23 is a linear combination of the spherical harmonics with @xmath35 or 1 , since these possess no spin 2 component .",
    "if we then set @xmath36 on the boundary , so as to eliminate the derivatives of the polarization , we are forced to consider circular patches @xmath24 , in which case a combination of the two @xmath37 harmonics works .",
    "this implies that the electric and magnetic signals can be probed by performing line integrals around circles , as emphasized in refs .",
    "these line integrals can be performed around any circle that is enclosed in the observed region of the sky , and it is unclear how to obtain a complete set of statistically independent observables in order to extract all of the available information . also for current experiments , performing one - dimensional line integrals on pixelized maps is unlikely to be a good way to extract information robustly .    in this paper , we suggest choosing the window functions so that the line integrals around @xmath33 that appear in the construction of @xmath38 and @xmath27 contain no contribution from the magnetic and electric polarization respectively . in the absence of special symmetries ( see below for exceptions that arise in the case of circular patches ) this requires that @xmath23 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 all vanish on the boundary .",
    "these conditions are equivalent to demanding that the window function and its normal derivative vanish on @xmath33 . with such a choice of window",
    "we can measure the electric and magnetic signals using only the surface integrals @xmath41 since the window functions are scalar functions on the sphere we can expand them in spherical harmonics , @xmath42 ( the square root factor is included for later convenience . )",
    "we need not include @xmath35 and 1 spherical harmonics since they do not contribute to the spin - weight @xmath43 window functions , and the boundary integral terms automatically separate for these multipoles . in practice , we are only interested in probing scales to some particular @xmath44 ( e.g.  the magnetic signal from tensor modes has maximal power for @xmath45 and decreases rapidly with @xmath46 ) , so the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hwindow ] ) can be truncated at some finite @xmath44 .",
    "we shall focus on the case where the observed sky patch is azimuthally symmetric in which case the construction of exact window functions becomes particularly simple .",
    "the harmonic - based method we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : sep ] provides a practical solution to constructing a non - redundant set of window functions that separate the electric and magnetic modes exactly .",
    "in addition , for the special case of isotropic , uncorrelated noise on the observed polarization , these simple properties are preserved in the variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for observations over non - azimuthally symmetric patches our method can , of course , be used over the largest inscribed circular patch , but in this case there is inevitable information loss since we use only a subset of the observed data .",
    "however , we expect that the method presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : sep ] could also be applied directly to the full observed region to construct window functions that achieve approximate separation of electric and magnetic polarization .",
    "consider the case of an azimuthally - symmetric patch so the boundary @xmath49 consists of one or two small circles .",
    "for each azimuthal dependence on @xmath50 we can construct combinations @xmath51 that satisfy the necessary boundary conditions .",

    "it follows that for @xmath37 there are @xmath53 linearly independent window functions that satisfy the boundary conditions . for @xmath54",
    "it will be shown in the next section that there is only one independent linear constraint per boundary circle , so there are @xmath55 possible window functions ( @xmath56 for a boundary composed of two circles ) . for @xmath57",
    "there are two linear constraints per boundary circle which can be taken to be the vanishing of @xmath58 and its normal derivative . in this case",
    "there are @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) window functions for boundaries consisting of one ( two ) small circles .",
    "since we are only considering a fraction of the sky not all of the window functions counted above may return observables @xmath47 and @xmath48 containing independent information .",
    "this arises because for large @xmath44 , or small patches , there will generally arise non - zero window coefficients @xmath61 that produce spin 2 window functions that are poorly supported over the patch .",

    "comes to be observed we should have some prior information about the tensor amplitude from accurate measurement of the temperature power spectrum .",
    "however at this point we do not have very useful information about the prior distribution , and to consider the possible results of future experiments it is useful to assume no information . the maximum entropy prior ( the uniform prior ) is probably not appropriate in this case  do we really think that all values of @xmath210 ( below a certain bound ) are equally likely rather than , say , all values of @xmath401 being equally likely ?",
    "the uniform prior gives radically different answers depending on the choice of variable . the jeffreys prior @xmath402^{1/2},\\ ] ] is reparameterization invariant  @xcite , and therefore does not suffer from this problem .",
    "the jeffreys prior goes like @xmath403 if @xmath404 and in general is improper ( does not have a finite integral ) , though this is not a problem for evaluating test statistics since the integral of the product with the likelihood function will be finite .",
    "it is also not a true prior in the sense that it depends on what data is going to be collected , but this is really a good thing as it concentrates the prior probability in the region where we need it in order to obtain a detection . since the prior is not localized the posterior probability of the null - hypothesis will depend on where one cuts off the prior .",
    "however if one only ever compares the bayes factors @xmath398 the cut - off is not very important since the likelihood function will be localized . for this reason performing classical hypothesis tests using @xmath398",
    "is rather more independent of the prior information than considering the values of the posterior probability , though clearly it is the latter which is rigorous and contains all the available information .",
    "classical hypothesis tests are useful for assessing probability of getting a detection at a given significance , though it should be remembered that getting a detection at @xmath405 per cent confidence does _ not _ mean a the probability of @xmath406 per cent that the signal is pure noise .",

    "using classical hypothesis tests to compute the probability of getting a detection at a given significance for a given true @xmath210 is significantly simpler than computing and interpreting the corresponding distribution of the posterior probability distributions .    for full sky surveys",
    "there are a large number of statistically - independent magnetic variables , which can be thought of as the eigenvectors of @xmath407 .",

    "the likelihood ratio is then a monotonic function of the test statistic @xmath417 the quantity @xmath418 gives the number of standard deviations the maximum likelihood is from pure noise , which is an good intuitive measure of the number of ` sigmas ' at which the magnetic signal has been detected . if any eigenvalues become large enough then the small @xmath210 approximation will fail and one needs to compute the full likelihood ratio to obtain optimal results .",
    "the @xmath419 statistic is a function only of the vector @xmath420 and the matrix @xmath421 , so working in the frame in which the matrix is diagonal the statistic is simple to compute .",
    "note that @xmath422 and @xmath213 can be negative and correspond to a non - detection .",
    "the second order approximation can also be used to speed up computing the full likelihood function for integration against a prior . in the diagonal frame",
    "it is straightforward to identify any modes with high signal to noise  if there are some then the likelihood for these modes can be computed exactly .",
    "the likelihood for the remaining low signal to noise modes can be computed quickly using the approximation in which the likelihood is gaussian . multiplying these together",
    "allows the full likelihood function to be computed , and hence the the probability distribution of @xmath398 . whilst this is slower than using the @xmath419 statistic it is a useful check , and",
    "may be essential when there are very high signal to noise modes .    for good detections",
    "the prior is not very important as long as it is not small over the bulk of the likelihood .",

    "we found that detection probabilities computed using full likelihood results with the jeffreys prior tend to agree very closely with those computed using @xmath419 .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath419 rather than computing the full likelihood distribution is that it is computationally significantly simpler and faster , which is useful , though by no means essential , for performing accurate monte - carlo computations .",
    "there is no problem computing using the full likelihood distribution exactly from single samples of actual observed data .      in the limit that @xmath428",
    "the likelihood function can be approximated by the first two terms in its taylor series in @xmath210 .",

    "however in general @xmath419 performs significantly better when the eigenvalues are distributed less evenly , or when there are not that many eigenvalues . as the signal to noise increases @xmath419 also performs much less sub - optimally than the null - buster",
    ".    for the case of magnetic polarization observations",
    "the @xmath419 statistic outperforms the null - buster for a wide range of patch sizes in realistic reionization models .",
    "the large scale magnetic signal coming from low redshift ( @xmath435 ) reionization gives a small number of modes with relatively high signal to noise ( see fig .",
    "[ contribs ] ) , and the conditions under which the null - buster is a good statistic are therefore not satisfied .",
    "the qualitative reason that the null - buster performs poorly is that the position of the maximum and the curvature of the likelihood function are correlated , so dividing the actual maximum by the expected curvature does not give you an accurate measure of the number of ` sigmas ' from zero for a particular observation .",
    "this makes the null hypothesis distribution unnecessarily broad at large values , and therefore makes it harder to rule out the null hypothesis with good significance .",
    "the @xmath419 statistic has a much sharper distribution than the null - buster ( which has a distribution similar to chi - squared ) in the alternative hypothesis , and the value of @xmath419 corresponds much more closely to the significance ( measured in gaussian - like ` sigmas ' ) of the result .",
    "a few points can be made in the null - buster s defence .",
    "firstly it is slightly easier to compute than @xmath419 .",
    "secondly , since we motivated the @xmath419 by assuming a gaussian signal it is conceivable that the null - buster could perform better with certain non - gaussian signals .",
    "lastly , the null - buster is quadratic which makes it easy to calculate the mean and variance analytically .",
