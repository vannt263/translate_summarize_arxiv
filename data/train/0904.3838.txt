    "the role of geometry has continued drawing attention in statistical physics . a curved surface , for example ,",
    "has been a useful test ground to study ergodicity  @xcite , and curved nanoscale carbon structures have been expected to possess interesting elastic and magnetic properties  @xcite . recently",
    ", rapid development of soft material sciences also requires a precise understanding of physics on a curved surface in terms of geometric interactions  @xcite .",
    "one immediate question from the statistical - physical viewpoint is how phase transitions occur on such a curved surface since they in general depend on geometrical factors .",
    "in particular , a negative gaussian curvature yielding a saddle - like hyperbolic surface has been more commonly studied in critical phenomena than a positive one since a positive curvature tends to make a closed surface so that it is hard to extend the system size while keeping the magnitude of the curvature constant . in a negatively curved surface , the length scale grows only logarithmically with the surface area , and thus one could expect a mean - field - like critical behavior in many systems .",
    "whereas this expectation was proven true for the bulk of the ising spin system  @xcite , the @xmath2 spin model has no local order at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this lack of order in the @xmath2 model is attributed to the gapless spin - wave excitations that can arise from the boundary at any finite temperature @xmath3 .",
    "this argument is based on the fact that a negatively curved surface contains a huge amount of boundary points : that is , for a negatively curved surface , the ratio of surface area to perimeter ( which is the two - dimensional example of the so - called surface - volume ratio in general dimension ) remain nonvanishing even in the large - system limit .",
    "since it was pointed out that a system may have a novel behavior due to the presence of a nonvanishing boundary  @xcite , there have been ongoing studies to clarify this issue  @xcite . while the boundary effects can be sometimes excluded , for example , by using a periodic boundary condition  @xcite or by mathematical abstractions  @xcite , it is often crucial to understand how a boundary affects the physical properties since it may give the most important contribution to an observed behavior as will be explained in this work .",
    "the complete difference between the ising and the @xmath2 models with respect to the presence or absence of the ordered phase motivates us to study the @xmath0-state clock model on a negatively curved surface .",
    "the @xmath0-state clock model is equivalent to the ising model for @xmath4 and approaches to the @xmath2 model for @xmath5 .",
    "thereby one can obtain a better understanding on how the phase structure changes in between with varying @xmath0 . in this paper , we present the following findings : first , the critical temperature @xmath6 is indeed proportional to the energy gap to excite the spin fluctuations .",
    "second , we report an intermediate phase with a diverging susceptibility between the ordered and disordered phases .",
    "while it corresponds to the quasiliquid phase in the planar case , an interesting difference is that this intermediate region characterized by the vanishing order parameter and diverging susceptibility is observable at every @xmath1 on the curved structure .",
    "this point will be further discussed by studying the cayley tree analytically .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "each hyperbolic tessellation gives a resulting lattice structure , which will be generally called a hyperbolic lattice . in this work ,",
    "we construct one type of hyperbolic lattices , i.e. , a heptagonal lattice denoted as @xmath11 , in a concentric way as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyperb ] .",
    "we start with the zeroth layer , a point in the middle of the poincar disk  @xcite , and surround it by three heptagons .",
    "then the newly added 15 points constitute the first layer .",
    "likewise , attaching 12 heptagons all the way around the first layer adds 45 more points , which make the second layer , and so on .",
    "a heptagonal lattice of a level @xmath12 means that it is made up to the @xmath12th layer , and its system size is then given by @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "as @xmath14 increases exponentially with @xmath12 , the surface - volume ratio does not vanish even in the large - size limit .",
    "an important consequence of the non - vanishing surface - volume ratio is an enhancement of boundary effects that exceeds the bulk - spin contributions .",
    "sometimes only the bulk properties are studied by restricting ourselves to a distance less than @xmath15 from the zeroth layer with a constant @xmath16 .",
    "however , one should remember that the system would not be properly described by the bulk part since its fraction eventually vanishes : suppose that @xmath17 for some curvature - dependent constant @xmath18 .",
    "the bulk fraction is then @xmath19 , which exponentially decreases as @xmath12 grows .",
    "this is why the boundary - spin contribution plays a dominant role in determining the physical properties of the whole system .    by the @xmath0-state clock model , we mean a spin system described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath20 where each spin @xmath21 can have one of @xmath0 possible angles , @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a magnetic field along the direction for @xmath25 with a magnitude @xmath26 .",

    "in addition , the case of @xmath29 is equivalent to the three - state potts model  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath30 has the same universality class as the ising system since the partition function of the four - state clock model at temperature @xmath3 is formally isomorphic to that of two uncoupled ising systems at @xmath31  @xcite .    in the planar case",
    ", the @xmath0-state clock model for @xmath32 generally has three phases in the @xmath33 plane  @xcite .",
    "two among the three are ordered and disordered phases as in the ising model . from the existence of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt )",
    "phase in the @xmath2 limit  @xcite , one can argue that the third , quasiliquid phase emerges for @xmath34 in the intermediate temperature range  @xcite .",
    "the low transition point where the ordered phase vanishes is roughly described by @xmath35 , as explained in the villain approximation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the high transition point , where disordered phase begins , remains almost constant around @xmath36 for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant  @xcite .    with a constant negative curvature , as shown in the next section ,",
    "some of these behaviors still look qualitatively similar . specifically , the lower transition point is roughly proportional to @xmath39 whereas the higher one does not change much as @xmath0 increases .",
    "however , there also exist clear differences in that the intermediate phase between these two temperatures is created by a very different mechanism discussed later , and is present at every @xmath1 .",
    "phase transitions on a curved surface can be very different whether a boundary of the system is considered or not .",
    "as our numerical experiments include both of the curvature and boundary effects , we will first consider only the curvature effects in this part , in order to highlight the boundary effects more clearly .",
    "suppose the @xmath0-state clock model is in a continuum limit .",
    "phenomenologically one may write a dimensionless free energy @xmath40 of this system in the ordered phase  @xcite as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a position vector ( @xmath43 ) rescaled by a specific length scale , @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 . in eq .",

    "such an exponential decay in @xmath66 on the hyperbolic surface apparently suggests the absence of order - disorder phase transition in the current system .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "a noteworthy point is that the number of spins @xmath67 within a distance @xmath68 also increases exponentially in a hyperbolic surface , which results in divergence of the magnetic susceptibility defined by @xmath69 where the summation is over every possible pair @xmath70 of spins .",
    "even if @xmath71 shows an exponential decay , susceptibility @xmath72 is able to diverge at finite @xmath3 by satisfying @xmath73 , from which the critical temperature @xmath6 can be located  @xcite .",

    "if we only introduce the curvature effect but without the finite surface - volume ratio , the quasi - long - range order becomes a genuine order and the higher transition is of the mean - field type since fluctuation decays exponentially ( see sec  [ sub : hom ] )",
    ". however , the presence of a boundary can not be neglected , which breaks the mean - field picture , and the spin - wave excitation appears to be crucial in establishing the ordered phase . in the limit of @xmath5 , the excitation becomes gapless so that the transition temperature approaches zero .",
    "in addition , the susceptibility begins to diverge at a higher temperature , indicating a similar phenomenon to the kt transition with a diverging susceptibility . by analyzing the clock model on the cayley tree , we suggest that the hyperbolic nature of the underlying lattice structure makes the third phase observable for every @xmath1 .    s.k.b . and",
