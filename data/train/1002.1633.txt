    "for given class @xmath0 of countable partial orders we say that class @xmath0 contains an _ embedding - universal _ ( or simply _ universal _ ) structure @xmath1 if every partial order @xmath2 can be found as induced suborder of @xmath1 ( or in other words , there exists embedding from @xmath3 to @xmath1 ) .",
    "a partial order @xmath3 is _ ultrahomogeneous _ ( or simply _ homogeneous _ ) , if every isomorphism of finite suborders of @xmath3 can be extended to an automorphism of @xmath3 .",
    "a partial order @xmath3 is _ generic _ if it is both _",
    "ultrahomogeneous _ and _",
    "universal_.    the generic objects can be obtained from the limit @xcite .",
    "but it is important that often these generic objects ( despite their apparent complexity and universality ) admit a concise presentation .",
    "thus for example the rado graph ( i.e. countable universal and homogeneous undirected graph ) can be represented in various ways by elementary properties of sets or finite sequences , number theory or even probability .",
    "similar concise representations were found for some other generic objects such as all undirected ultrahomogeneous graphs @xcite or the urysohn space @xcite .",
    "the study of generic partial order also motivated this paper and we consider representation of the generic partial order in section 3 .",
    "the notion of finite presentation we interpret here broadly as a succinct representation of an infinite set , succint in the sense that elements are finite models with relations induced by `` compatible mappings '' ( such as homomorphisms ) between the corresponding models .",
    "this intuitive definition suffices as we are interested in the ( positive ) examples of such representations .",
    "a finite presentation of the generic partial order is given in @xcite however this construction is quite complicated .",
    "this paper gives a more streamlined construction and relates it to conway surreal numbers ( see section 3 ) .    in section 2 we present several simple constructions which yield ( countably ) universal partial orders .",
    "such objects are interesting on their own and were intensively studied in the context of universal algebra and categories .",
    "for example , it is a classical result of pultr and trnkov @xcite that finite graphs with the homomorphism order are countably universal quasiorder .",
    "extending and completing @xcite we give here several constructions which yields to universal partial orders .",
    "these constructions include :    1 .",
    "the order @xmath4 on sets of words in the alphabet @xmath5 .",
    "the dominance order on the binary tree @xmath6 .",
    "the inclusion order of finite sets of finite intervals @xmath7 .",
    "the inclusion order of convex hulls of finite sets of points in the plane @xmath8 .",
    "the order of piecewise linear functions on rationals @xmath9",
    "the inclusion order of periodic sets @xmath10",
    "the order of sets of truncated vectors ( generalization of orders of vectors of finite dimension ) @xmath11 . 8 .",
    "the orders implied by grammars on words @xmath12 .",
    ".   the homomorphism order of oriented paths @xmath13 .    note that with universal partial orders we have more freedom ( than with the generic pratial order ) and as a consequence we give a perhaps surprising variety of finite presentations .",
    "we start with a simple representation by means of finite sets of binary words .",
    "this representation seems to capture properties of such a universal partial order very well and it will serve as our `` master '' example . in most other cases",
    "we prove the universality of some particular partial order by finding a mapping from the words representation into the structure in question .",
    "this technique will be shown in several applications in the next sections . while some of these structures are known be universal , see e.g. @xcite , in several cases we can prove the universality in a new , we believe , much easier way .",
    "the embeddings of structures are presented as follows ( ones denoted by dotted lines are not presented in this paper , but references are given ) .              at this point",
    "we would like to mention that the ( countable ) universality is an essentially finite problem as it can be formulated as follows : by an _ on - line representation _ of a class @xmath0 of partial orders in a partial order @xmath3 , we mean that one can construct an embedding @xmath14 of any partial order @xmath15 in class @xmath0 under the restriction that the elements of @xmath16 are revealed one by one .",
    "the on - line representation of a class of partial orders can be considered as a game between two players @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( usually alice and bob ) .",
    "player @xmath18 chooses a partial order @xmath3 in the class @xmath0 , and reveals the elements of @xmath19 one by one to player @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is a bad guy ) .",
    "whenever an element of @xmath20 of @xmath19 is revealed to @xmath17 , the relations among @xmath20 and previously revealed elements are also revealed .",
    "player @xmath17 is required to assign a vertex @xmath21before the next element is revealed  such that @xmath22 is an embedding of the suborder induced by @xmath3 on the already revealed elements of @xmath15 .",
    "player @xmath17 wins the game if he succeeds in constructing an embedding @xmath22 .",
    "the class @xmath0 of partial orders is on - line representable in the partial order @xmath3 if player @xmath17 has a winning strategy .    on - line",
    "representation ( describing winning strategy of @xmath17 ) is a convenient way of showing the universality of given partial order . in particular",
    "it transforms problem of embedding countable structures into a finite problem of extending the existing partial embedding by next element .",
    "we say that a partial order @xmath3 has the _ extension property _ if the following holds : for any finite mutually disjoint subsets @xmath23 there exist a vertex @xmath24 such that @xmath25 for each @xmath26 , @xmath27 for each @xmath28 and neither @xmath29 nor @xmath30 for each @xmath31 .",
    "the extension property is a stronger form of on - line representability of any partial order . using a zig - zag argument",
    "it is easy to show that a partial order having the extension property is homogeneous ( and thus generic ) .    in section 3",
    "we describe a finite representation of the generic partial order related to conway s surreal numbers . somewhat surprisingly , this is the only known finite presentation of the generic partial order @xcite .",
    "the constructions of universal partial orders are easier , but they are often not generic . we discuss reasons why other structures fail to be ultrahomogeneous .",
    "in particular we will look for gaps in the partial order . recall that the _ gap _ in a partial order @xmath3 is a pair of elements @xmath32 such that @xmath33 . a partial order having no gaps",
    "is called _",
    "dense_. we will show examples of universal partial orders both with gaps and without gaps but still failing to be generic .",
    "to prove the universality of a given partially ordered set is often a difficult task @xcite .",
    "however , the individual proofs , even if developed independently , use similar tools .",
    "we demonstrate this by isolating a `` master '' construction ( in section [ wordsection ] ) .",
    "this construction is then embedded into partial orders defined by other structures ( as listed above ) .",
    "we shall see that the representation of this particular order is flexible enough to simplify further embeddings .",
    "the set of all words over the alphabet @xmath34 is denoted by @xmath35 . for words",
    "@xmath36 we write @xmath37 if and only if @xmath38 is an initial segment ( left factor ) of @xmath39 .",
    "thus we have , for example , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
