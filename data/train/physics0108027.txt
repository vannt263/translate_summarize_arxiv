    "to achieve the small emittance typically required for beam acceleration , a stored - muon - beam neutrino factory may require transverse ionization cooling of the muon beam  @xcite",
    ". such cooling can be accomplished by passing the beam through energy - absorbing material and accelerating structures , both embedded within a focusing magnetic lattice ; the rate of change @xmath0 of normalized transverse emittance with path length is then given approximately by  @xcite @xmath1 where muon energy @xmath2 is in gev , @xmath3 is the transverse amplitude function of the lattice evaluated at the location of the absorber , and @xmath4 is the radiation length of the absorber medium .",
    "simulations show that enough transverse cooling can be achieved to build a high - performance neutrino factory  @xcite .",
    "for example , neglecting coulomb scattering ( _ i.e. _ , ignoring the last term in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] ) , for typical parameter values ( _ e.g. _  @xmath5mm@xmath6rad and 200mev/@xmath7 muon momentum ) and a 1015% packing fraction of absorber within the cooling channel , the cooling rate of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] implies transverse emittance reduction by a factor @xmath8 in @xmath9 m , about 3% of the muon decay length . in practice , with @xmath10 cm , one does a factor @xmath11 worse than this because of scattering and other effects  @xcite .    to minimize the effects of coulomb scattering of the muons",
    "as they pass through the absorber , it has been proposed to use liquid hydrogen ( lh@xmath12 ) as the energy - absorbing medium  @xcite .",
    "key issues in absorber r&d include coping with the large heat deposition by the intense ( @xmath13s ) muon beam and minimizing scattering in the absorber - vessel windows . specifications of absorbers for some representative cases are given in table  [ tab : abs ] .",
    "our absorber - window r&d program is discussed in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we give an overview of absorber r&d and a summary of recent progress .",

    "divergence at max .",
    "size and vice versa .",
    "a new idea has started to receive serious consideration : use of high - pressure gaseous ( rather than liquid ) hydrogen as the energy - absorbing medium . if the gas is allowed to fill the entire cooling channel instead of being confined to roughly 10% of the channel length ( as in current designs )",
    ", matching the energy loss to the rf accelerating gradient requires a factor @xmath15 in density compared to that at stp .",
    "the pressure needed , especially if the hydrogen is cooled to liquid - nitrogen temperature , is then comparable to what has been used in the past for gaseous cherenkov counters : about 20 atm .    upon first consideration",
    "such an approach would appear to have significant drawbacks .",
    "these include the need for thick windows to withstand the pressure as well as the introduction of material inside the rf cavities , which could cause breakdown and ( from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] ) degrade the cooling rate ( via multiple scattering at high - beta points of the lattice ) .",
    "however , calculations  @xcite show that the cooling performance can in fact be _ enhanced _ by use of gaseous absorbers : the many thin windows used in the lh@xmath12 case are replaced by only two thick windows , which degrade the final emittance negligibly , and the dense gas inside the cavities in fact _ suppresses _ breakdown  @xcite .",
    "the recent development of cooling lattices with constant @xmath3  @xcite alleviates the last of the drawbacks .",
    "further potential advantages include a more adiabatic cooling process , in which the energy loss and acceleration occur continuously and muon momentum swings are reduced , a slightly shorter overall channel length , which reduces muon decay losses , and improvement of rf efficiency via the decrease of cavity resistivity at low temperature .",
    "a number of questions remain , including whether paschen s law ( for high - voltage breakdown ) is applicable in this regime of frequency , gas density , and radiation level , whether ln@xmath12-temperature operation of 201-mhz rf cavities is indeed more economical when refrigeration costs are factored in , whether rf couplers can be designed to withstand 20-atm differential pressure , and whether constant-@xmath3 cooling channels ( even with gaseous absorber ) are cost - effective compared to other proposed approaches . these will be subjects of r&d in the coming year .",
