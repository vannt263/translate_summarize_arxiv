    "the spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , which have been experimentally realized in optical potentials , exhibit a rich variety of magnetic effects . due to the internal degrees of freedom , they give rise to phenomena that are not present in the single component becs@xcite , such as magnetic crystallization , spin textures , and fractional vortices , ect . in a spinor condensate , there exists an interplay between superfluidity and magnetism associated to the spin - gauge symmetry in the hamiltonian .",
    "a direct consequence is that the ferromagnetic becs spontaneously induce a supercurrent as the spin is locally rotated@xcite .",
    "the mean - field motion of the dilute spinor condensates is governed by the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes)@xcite . there are many theoretical works that numerically solve gpes or the corresponding stationary equations@xcite .",
    "analytical solutions to the gpes are generally difficult because of the nonlinear density - density coupling between the atoms as well as the spin - spin coupling between the hyperfine states . many efforts have been contributed to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) soliton limits@xcite , mainly for the @xmath0 condensates .",
    "nevertheless , exact analytical solutions for the spinor becs , especially for the @xmath1 condensates , are absent in literature . in a previous work ,",
    "we have presented exact solutions to the @xmath0 gpes@xcite . in this paper",
