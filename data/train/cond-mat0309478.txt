    "the quantum - confined stark effect ( qcse ) has attracted a lot of attention since its discovery@xcite due to its diverse optoelectronics applications ( see for example ref . ) . in quantum",
    "well ( qw ) structures with a layer thickness less than the effective exciton bohr radius , an electron and a hole are forced to orbit closer to each other , and the binding energy of the electron - hole pair increases by a factor between two and three .",
    "this additional stability makes exciton resonances in qw s observable even at room temperatures .",
    "more important , these resonances are still observable in a uniform electric field perpendicular to the growth direction , which is as large as 50 times the classical ionization field for a three - dimensional exciton .",
    "the latter also produces a relatively large red shift in the absorption peak up to @xmath0 times the binding energy of the exciton , while the width of the exciton resonance grows only moderately .",
    "such a behavior is opposite to the properties of 3-d excitons or qw excitons in a field parallel to the plane of the qw.@xcite the origin of this phenomenon stems from the fact that the electric field induced decay time for qw excitons is determined not by its binding energy ( @xmath1 mev in gaas / algaas quantum wells ) , but rather by the quantum well barriers heights ( @xmath2 mev ) .    despite the fact that the qcse was discovered almost 20 years ago and qualitatively",
    "is well understood , there is no complete quantitative solution for the problem so far .",
    "usually , it is treated numerically with different degrees of approximation .",
    "the conventional approach consists in the separation of the problem into two consecutive steps .",
    "the first step in modelling qcse is to omit the coulomb interaction of an electron - hole pair and to find single particle resonance positions for an electron and a hole separately . in moderate fields ( up to @xmath3 v / cm ) and non - shallow quantum wells ( quantum wells with more than one discrete level inside )",
    "the lowest - lying resonances are so sharp that they are often approximately treated as bound states , neglecting the possibility of tunnelling .",
    "these simple methods include either an infinite well approximation,@xcite where the effect of penetration of the electron ( hole ) wave functions under the barrier is taken into account by introducing an effective qw width,@xcite or variational calculations for finite potential wells@xcite , which produce only the real part of the exciton quasi - energy . within a weak - field regime , the stark shift is a small second - order effect in the perturbation theory sense .",
    "the absolute value of a shift decreases with a decrease of the qw width .",
    "achieving large shifts requires strong fields , where the perturbation theory fails . in this regime",
    "a significant broadening of the states appears due to the field induced tunnelling .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to devise non - perturbative methods for the correct determination of the exciton resonance energies and tunnelling life - times in these systems in the presence of a strong field .",
    "there are several ways of approaching this problem mathematically .",
    "the single - particle quasi - bound states in qw s in the presence of a uniform electric field have been studied with the help of the time - independent schrdinger equation using airy functions with real and complex arguments@xcite , stabilization technique@xcite , finite difference method@xcite and complex coordinate method@xcite .",
    "another group of methods utilizes a dynamical approach@xcite where the time evolution of a tunnelling wave packet is simulated by numerical integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "it is worth pointing out that all of the above mentioned calculations of decaying quasi - bound states are made in the single - particle approximation without consideration of the coulomb attraction between the electron and the hole .",
    "excitonic effects are incorporated at the next step of the calculations , which usually take into account only a real part of the exciton binding energy shift , and are performed with the help of variational methods@xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we develop an alternative method of studying qcse that allows us to calculate both the position of the exciton resonances and their field - induced tunnelling life - times on equal footing . this method is a generalization of a self - consistent approach developed recently by the authors@xcite for the exciton in qw without the electric field .",
    "second , we introduce the model of qcse in shallow quantum wells ( sqw ) , which allows us to obtain analytical results for the resonance positions and tunnelling widths as well as for the modified exciton `` ground state '' wave function . in this model",
    "we approximate sqw by a delta - functional potential .",
    "calculations are significantly simplified in this model due to the fact that the single - particle one - dimensional problem for a particle in a delta - potential and in an applied uniform electric field can be solved exactly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we generalize the self - consistent approach of ref .",
    "for the presence of the electric field , and derive main self - consistent field equations for complex resonance energy positions for qcse , using the method of complex scaling . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we apply our approach to the model of sqw for calculations of the effective exciton potential .",
    "one of the results of these calculations is the phase diagram representing regions of exciton s stability in strong electric fields for different well s widths and/or barrier potential .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to develop a new method for calculating excitonic characteristics in qw in the presence of the electric field due to qcse . in order to present the method",
    "clearly we consider the simplest model of qw excitons .",
    "in particular , we assume that both conduction and valence bands are non - degenerate , and that they both have an isotropic parabolic dispersion characterized by the masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "thus , we neglect valence - band mixing@xcite , anisotropy of the system , and dielectric@xcite and effective mass mismatch between the well and barrier materials",
    ". all these effects , which are very important for realistic computations can be , however , easily incorporated into our approach . throughout the paper we use effective atomic units ( a.u . ) , which means that all distances are measured in the units of the effective bohr radius @xmath6 , energies in the units of @xmath7 , and masses in the units of reduced electron - hole mass @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is an average background dielectric constant of the well and barrier materials . in these notations",
    "@xmath11 , where @xmath12 are effective masses of an electron and a heavy hole .    within the approximations explained above , and after the standard procedure of excluding the center - of - mass of the perpendicular motion in the plane of the layers@xcite , the excitonic hamiltonian is given by @xmath13,\\nonumber\\\\ v_{reh}(r ) & = & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r^2+(z_e - z_h)^2}}\\equiv -\\frac{1}{r } \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a gap energy , @xmath15 is the growth direction , @xmath16 measures a relative electron - hole distance in the transverse direction @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the quantum well confining potential in @xmath15 direction for the electron and the hole , respectively , and @xmath19 measures the strength of the electric field .",
    "we also assume that the quasi - bound exciton state is independent of the angle in the @xmath20 plane , and exclude the corresponding term from the kinetic energy of the relative motion @xmath21 .    strictly speaking , because of the possibility of tunnelling",
    ", there are no bound states in a system with uniform electric field , and the energy spectrum of hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is continuous : @xmath22 .",
    "this means that the respective wave functions do not vanish at infinity and , therefore , are not normalizable in @xmath23 sense",
    ". then a proper approach to the problem is to consider a scattering problem .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath24 contains all the physical information about the system .",
    "for example , resonances correspond to the poles of the @xmath24-matrix in the lower half of the complex energy plane .",
    "it is well known that these complex energies can also be found by solving an eigenvalue problem for the time - independent schrdinger equation , when the wave functions are chosen to have only outgoing components , but do not have an incident wave ( so called siegert or gamow wave functions ) .",
    "formally , after matching the usual `` bound - state '' boundary conditions one can obtain the correct complex eigenvalues .",
    "however , the eigenfunctions corresponding to these complex eigenvalues exponentially diverge .",
    "this circumstance prohibits an application of a standard variational principle to calculations of approximate values of the quasi - bound states for qcse .",
    "the complex coordinate ( complex scaling ) approach ( see for review refs . ) is devised to circumvent this problem .",
    "the idea consists in applying the coordinate transformation @xmath25 to all coordinates in the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "such a transformation makes the new hamiltonian non - hermitian [ @xmath26 and changes its spectrum respectively .",
    "the continuous spectrum moves@xcite to @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , a discrete set of complex points lying below the real energy appears .",
    "these complex quasi - energies correspond to the tunnelling resonances under consideration .",
    "it is important that the eigenfunctions @xmath28 corresponding to these complex eigenvalues @xmath29 are square - integrable , and , therefore , can be calculated by means of the variational principle , which requires the stationarity of the functional @xmath30=\\int\\;\\psi_{\\gamma}\\hat{h}(\\gamma)\\psi_{\\gamma}\\,dv\\left/      \\int\\;\\psi_{\\gamma}\\psi_{\\gamma}\\,dv.\\right.\\ ] ] it should be noted , however , that the biorthogonality normalization ( without complex conjugation of the left eigenvector ) is used in the definition of the energy functional instead of the standard scalar product .",
    "the complex quasi - energies should also be stationary with respect to changes in rotation angle @xmath31 .",
    "the method of complex scaling and methods similar to it are widely and successfully used in studies of atomic and molecular auto - decaying states@xcite .    the new variational principle , eq .",
    "( [ funw ] ) , for the rotated non - hermitian hamiltonian can be used for extension of the self - consistent method , recently developed by the authors@xcite , to the problem of qcse . according to this method",
    ", we construct an approximate exciton wave function @xmath32 with the help of the unknown functions @xmath33 , where each function @xmath34 depends on a fewer number of variables than the total wave function . considering variations of these functions independently , from the variational principle , eq .",
    "( [ funw ] ) , we obtain coupled integro - differential equations for @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting coupled equations can be solved by successive approximations .",
    "the convergence of this procedure allows for estimating to what degree a given functional dependence of the trial function is close to the exact wave function . in the case of zero electric field and sufficiently strong localization ( the exciton `` @xmath15-size '' is smaller than its three - dimensional bohr radius ) , we found@xcite that representation of the trial function in the form of a product of functions of different coordinates gives an excellent approximation for exciton energies even after only one iteration .",
    "we expect , therefore , that a similar form will give accurate results for quasi - bound states in the presence of the electric field , at least , when it is not very large .",
    "thus , we choose the trial function for the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) in the form of the product : @xmath35 assuming normalization of every function in this product , we substitute function eq .",
    "( [ mftrialf ] ) in eq .",

    "the main advantage of the approach described above is that it allows one to calculate , in principle , not only field - induced single - particle widths @xmath47 but the _ exciton width _",
    "@xmath48 as well , which describes a renormalization of the electron - hole pair life - time by the effective interaction . for moderate fields",

    "( [ mfeq1])([mfeq3 ] ) obtained after the first iteration of the self - consistent method for the case of a shallow quantum well , where some analytical results can be derived .",
    "it should be stressed that the most important feature of the complex scaling method is the biorthogonality normalization .",
    "the other feature , the coordinate rotation itself @xmath50 , is necessary to guarantee the convergence of the integrals ( [ efpotr],[efpotz ] ) . although , this rotation is important to negate the asymptotic divergence of the _ exact _ eigenfunctions of the quasi - bound state , it was found@xcite that in the case of sharp resonances ( when the width @xmath51 is small in comparison with the real part of the energy ) the optimal angle of rotation @xmath31 is close to zero .",
    "moreover , the final answer for quasi - energy is not very sensitive to the change of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , for approximate calculations we will fix @xmath52 and choose the trial functions to be square integrable from the very beginning .",
    "however , we will permit variational parameters to be _",
    "complex_. the latter assumption allows us to extract the resonance width in the problem , while still keeping the problem tractable .",
    "we will follow this procedure in the subsequent sections .",
    "a zero approximation of a self - consistent field approach for the electron ( hole ) part of the wave function in the @xmath15 direction , eqs .",
    "( [ mfeq20 ] ) , is equivalent to the standard problem of a single - particle quasi - bound state in qw .",
    "therefore , its solution can be obtained with the help of any method described previously@xcite .",
    "let us first solve the problem exactly using airy functions with complex arguments .",
    "we define a shallow quantum well as a well in which only one bound state exists for both electrons and holes .",
    "it is well - known that , if a well s width , @xmath54 , tends to zero , a shallow quantum well can be successfully described by a @xmath53-functional well @xmath55 where @xmath56 is characterizes the @xmath53-potential strength and @xmath57 is the barrier height . for convenience , the first constant term @xmath57 on the left hand side of eq .",

    "indeed , the more discrete levels exist in the qw the better the eiqw model works for the ground state , but it fails when the well has only one discrete level . on the other hand , the @xmath53-functional qw is not applicable for quantum wells with more than one level . for typical parameters in al@xmath64ga@xmath65as / gaas structures the range of applicability of @xmath53-functional sqw extends up to a well width @xmath66 .    the advantages of the @xmath53-functional sqw model become especially obvious in the case when a uniform electric field is applied .",

    "the smallness of the correction to the real part of the effective potential suggests that we can try to express this effective complex potential at finite field through the zero - field potential , renormalizing some of its parameters .",

    "we developed a self - consistent complex scaling approach for calculations of field - induced complex energies of single particle states as well as of the exciton quasi - energy in qws .",
    "this technique is a generalization of the self - consistent approach recently developed by the authors@xcite for the exciton in a qw without the presence of the electric field . for the case of strong confinement",
    ", we represented the trial function in factorized form and obtained the corresponding coupled self - consistent equations ( [ mfeq1][mfeq3 ] ) , which include the effective potentials ( [ efpotr],[efpotz ] ) .",

    "we further applied our approach to the case of a shallow quantum well . to this goal we developed the model of qcse in a @xmath53-functional quantum well , which allows us to obtain analytical results for the resonance positions and widths and the behavior of the modified exciton `` ground state '' wave function .",
    "this occurs because the single - particle one - dimensional problem in delta - potential and applied uniform electric field can be solved exactly .",
    "we also compared the exact results for single - particle complex energies with the complex scaling variational method results for a trial function in a simple form of two decaying exponents with different coefficients of decay .",
