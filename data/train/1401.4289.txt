    "in mathematically modelling infectious diseases , often compartment models are used .",
    "compartment models divide the population under consideration into disjunct sets of individuals with the same biological characteristics .",
    "prominent examples in infectious disease modelling are the _",
    "si _ , _ sis _ and _ sirs _ models , see for example @xcite .",
    "the models have in common that they depend on one or more parameters .",
    "for instance , all these models need a parameter , mostly called _ transmission rate _ @xmath0 that describes how effective contacts between susceptible and infected persons are with respect to spreading the disease . biological , chemical and physical properties of infectious agents as well as the behaviour of hosts , susceptible or infected , lead to a variety of possible values of @xmath1 even within the same class of disease the transmission characteristics may vary considerably , which was shown for example in influenza @xcite .",
    "this may impose practical problems in estimating and predicting the parameters .    in this work we analyse the temporal dynamics of the prevalence of infectious diseases in a non - parametric way .",
    "the temporal change of the prevalence is expressed in terms of the incidence and the recovery rate .",
    "we start with a simple compartment model that divides the population into those who are not infected ( suceptible ) , and those who are diseased ( figure [ fig : compmodel ] ) . the numbers of persons in the states _ susceptible _ and _ diseased _ are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( cases ) .",
    "the transition rates between the states are the incidence rate @xmath4 and the recovery rate @xmath5 , which depend on the time variable @xmath6        the equations characterising the changes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the compartment model of figure [ fig : compmodel ] are :    [ e : balance ] @xmath7    by applying the quotient rule to the prevalence @xmath8 and inserting these equations we get the following scalar ordinary differential equation ( ode )    @xmath9    the linear ode shows that the temporal change @xmath10 of the prevalence is a convex combination of the incidence rate @xmath4 and the recovery rate @xmath5 . the solution of with the initial condition @xmath11 is    @xmath12    where @xmath13    [ [ remark-1 ] ] remark 1 : + + + + + + + + +    if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constant and the disease is in equilibrium , i.e. @xmath14 equation in case of @xmath15 reads as @xmath16 this is the well - known result that the prevalence odds @xmath17 equals the product of incidence and mean duration of the disease .",
    "[ [ remark-2 ] ] remark 2 : + + + + + + + + +    for later use we define the triangle function @xmath18 let @xmath19 and @xmath20 then set @xmath21 the function has a triangular shape with a peak of height @xmath22 at @xmath23 an example of a triangle function is the red curve in figure [ fig : triangle ] .",
    "in this section we illustrate equations and by some examples .",
    "the first example assumes a rectangular time course of the incidence ( figure [ fig : rectangle ] ) .",
    "the _ support _ of the incidence ( i.e. , the set @xmath24 ) is @xmath25 , the support of the recovery rate is @xmath26 . on these intervals the values of the incidence and recovery",

    "is the blue curve.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    the resulting prevalence ( calculated by numerically integrating equation ) is shown as blue curve in figure [ fig : rectangle ] .      as we shall see in the next section",
    ", the time course of the incidence in a wave of influenza does not have a rectangular shape .",
    "it is ( approximately ) symmetric and has a peak in the middle .",
    "compared to the previous example , a triangular shape of the incidence is more realistic .",
    "we assume a wave of influenza having the incidence as shown by the red curve of figure [ fig : triangle ] : @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( per week ) .",
    "the recovery rate @xmath5 is assumed to be a triangle function , too , with @xmath30 and peak height 1.7 ( per week ) .",
    "the time course of the associated prevalence ( blue line in figure [ fig : triangle ] ) has been calculated by equation .        from figure",
    "[ fig : triangle ] it is apparent that the prevalence starts to increase later than the incidence . at about week 7 , the prevalence has overtaken the incidence . in week 10 the incidence peaks at @xmath31 ( per week ) , whereas the prevalence peaks at about 0.3 weeks later at the value @xmath32 in summary , we can see that the prevalence is delayed compared to the incidence and overshoots the peak of the incidence .      to illustrate equation ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",

    "figure [ fig : stationary ] shows the course of the associated prevalence ( blue ) .      for use in the next section we solve the following problem : given the triangular incidence @xmath40 what has to be the minimal @xmath41 in a triangular recovery @xmath42 and @xmath43 such that @xmath44 for all @xmath45 ? with other words : what is the minimal peak height @xmath46 of a triangular recovery rate @xmath5 that follows after a triangular incidence @xmath4 with height @xmath47 such that the disease is eradicated at @xmath48    for @xmath45 it holds @xmath49 with @xmath50    it is easy to see that @xmath51 for all @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we may speak of the _ terminal prevalence_. as the terminal prevalence @xmath52 is the product of two positive factors , the prevalence is positive for all @xmath48 hence , the only aim we can achieve is to bring @xmath52 below a prescribed threshold .",

    "[ fig : influenza ] it becomes apparent that influenza usually appears in the first quarter of the year and vanishes ( nearly ) completely from the second to the fourth quarter .",
    "an exception is the epidemic in the last quarter of 2009 .",
    "then , the swine flu ( h1n1 influenza ) became pandemic .",
    "we also see that not all age groups are affected equally from one wave of influenza to the other .",
    "it seems that as calendar time progresses , the more older age groups get involved .        in figure",
    "[ fig : influenza ] a whitish line is visible in the lower third of the image .",

    ".,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    during follow - up , the birth cohort faces twelve waves of influenza with different intensities ( see figure [ fig : cohort ] ) .",
    "three of them are analysed in more detail : the wave with relatively low incidence at 3.5 years of age ( spring 2002 ) , the moderate wave at age 8.5 ( spring 2007 ) and the swine flu at age 11.3 ( autumn 2009 ) .",
    "the corresponding incidences are shown as black curves in figure [ fig : incidencethreewaves ] .",
    ": spring 2002 ( left ) , spring 2007 ( middle ) and autumn 2009 ( right ) .",
    "the black curves are the raw incidence rates as reported to the robert - koch - institute @xcite .",

    "( see above ) we assume triangle functions for the recovery rates @xmath70 the support of the recovery rate @xmath5 is assumed to be @xmath71 and @xmath72 this corresponds to a mean delay of 10 with range 3 - 17 ( days ) .",
    "the peak heights @xmath73 of the recovery rates @xmath74 are calculated as in example 4 by forcing the terminal prevalence to be less than one per mille of the peak incidence .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab : waves ] .",

    "the shapes are very similar but the peak values differ considerably .        during the waves in spring 2002 and 2007 the peak prevalence was @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "the maximum of the prevalence during the swine flu epidemic in autumn was @xmath88 roughly speaking , the three peak prevalences differ by about one magnitude .",
    "this is consistent with the incidence rates , which approximately differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "in this work we have described a disease model that links the temporal change of the prevalence to the incidence and the recovery rates .",
    "the model is non - parametric in the sense that it does not depend on biological , behavioural or disease - specific parameters .",
    "it is only based on the common epidemiological measures incidence and recovery rate . in that respect",
    "the model is very flexible and is not restricted to a specific class of infectious disease .    after the introduction of the disease model , the characterising equations and some examples ,",
    "the model has been applied to incidence of influenza in germany during 2001 - 2013 .",
    "the incidence data stem from the robert - koch - institute , which is the official authority each confirmed case of influenza in germany by law has to be reported to .",
    "since data about recovery rates are not published , assumptions had to be made . with these assumptions",
    "the prevalence of influenza during three waves has been calculated for a hypothetical birth cohort . during the three waves of influenza , the resulting prevalence portions in the birth cohort are low .",
    "there are mainly two reasons : the first is the short duration of symptoms of averagely 10 days ( range 3 - 17 days ) , which implies a high recovery rate with onset soon after the start of the wave of influenza .",
    "the second reason lies in the data itself . presumably , the cases reported to the robert - koch - institute are only the most severe cases .",
    "it is very likely that a lot of patients with the symptoms of influenza have not been examined by a medical doctor at all , or have not been examined in detail ( for example by pcr ) .",
    "those cases have not been _ confirmed influenza cases _ that statutorily have to be reported .",
    "thus , they are not covered by the incidence rates in this article .",
    "the fraction of unreported cases is difficult to access and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "although the equations are mathematically correct in the context they were developed for ( no mortality , no migration ) , due to this coverage issue the calculated prevalence portions have to be interpreted very carefully .",
    "another limitation of this article lies in the mathematical models for the incidence and recovery rates . here",
    ", we have used rectangle and triangle functions . in countries with seasonal waves of influenza , incidence and",
    "recovery rates vanish in certain periods .",
    "thus , in modelling single waves of influenza , functions with bounded support would be preferable . here ,",
    "we have chosen triangle and rectangle functions , but other functions may be possible as well , for example b - splines . in regions where influenza is present during the whole year , incidence and remission do not have bounded support .",
    "so far , the model in figure [ fig : compmodel ] does not include the impact of mortality .",
    "one may do so by changing the equations in : @xmath89 then , equation changes to @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xcite . note that equation becomes equation in case of @xmath92 . here",
    "an interesting point becomes obvious : equation is a consequence of equation .",
    "however , while equation implyies @xmath93 i.e. the population size remains constant , equation does not imply this .",
    "as it is a special case of equation , equation holds true in the presence of mortality with @xmath94"
