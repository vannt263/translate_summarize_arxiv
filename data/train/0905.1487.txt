    "such objects are often unusually bright in the mid infrared compared to other spectral regions . at high galactic latitudes , these surveys include the noao deep wide field survey ( ndwfs ) in botes @xcite , the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire , lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) , and the spitzer first look survey ( fls , fadda et al .",

    "it is known from targeted observations with @xmath5 that some stars have mid - infrared excesses at 24 @xmath3 m , usually attributed to circumstellar dust arising in debris disks @xcite . by using similar criteria for defining infrared excess as in these previous targeted studies , it is possible to use the wide area @xmath5 surveys to produce unbiased lists of stars with infrared excesses .",
    "the high latitude surveys are especially useful , because they minimize confusion with other galactic stars and are in regions chosen to have low zodiacal background .    in the present paper",
    ", we identify and discuss the characteristics of galactic stars in the botes and fls survey areas ( the first two surveys for which we had access to complete and reliable catalogs ) , giving in total a flux limited sample of galactic stars within an area of @xmath8 14 deg@xmath6 .",
    "we list all stellar sources ( 128 in bootes and 140 in the fls ) with @xmath9 @xmath10 17 mag . and f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) @xmath4 1 mjy .",
    "among these stars , we identify those which have excess f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) compared to that expected from a stellar photosphere .    for comparison to the f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) , we utilize available @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath7 photometry from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",

    "we restrict our analysis to sources in botes and the fls having f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) @xmath4 1 mjy to assure that the infrared detections are of high precision , with s / n @xmath4 15 .",
    "the 5 @xmath14 positional uncertainty for unresolved sources with these flux densities is 2.0 , based on comparisons of 24 @xmath3 m  sources with unambiguous optical identifications .",
    "the botes and fls surveys use much deeper mips observations than in the targeted studies of bright stars distributed over the sky such as in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "despite the fact that we are observing much fainter stars than the targeted studies , we are sensitive to a similar fraction of infrared excess above the expected photospheric emission .",

    "( one known quasar was rediscovered , and has been excluded from the list . ) the requirement that sources be optically unresolved is to assure that we are not selecting galaxies .    to identify bright stars , we first generated lists of @xmath5 24@xmath3 m  sources which are identified with optical sources in the survey catalogs , using as the criterion for identification that coordinates agree to within 2.0   in the merged infrared / optical catalogs .",
    "our initial criteria for identifying sources optically used @xmath16 mag . because these are the magnitudes given in the merged catalogs .",
    "the ndwfs and fls surveys are designed primarily for the identification of very faint optical sources , to @xmath16 @xmath8 26 mag . , and the positional identification criterion works well for faint , unresolved sources .",
    "brighter , resolved galaxies and stars brighter than @xmath16 @xmath8 16 may not be reliably identified in this way because of such problems as saturation of the source image or complex image structure .",
    "it is sometimes difficult , for example , to determine if saturated sources in the optical survey images are stars or galaxies .",
    "the best way to assure that all optically bright sources have been identified is to examine individually the location of each 24@xmath3 m  source which does not have an optical counterpart in the merged catalog in order to determine if the absence of a counterpart is because the optical source is too faint , or because it is too bright and too large on the images for an accurate position . to assure a complete list of bright stars , it is also necessary to examine individually all sources with listed counterpart magnitudes @xmath16 @xmath10 17 to verify if these sources are stars or galaxies .",
    "the magnitude cutoff of @xmath16 @xmath10 17 is chosen to assure that all bright galactic stars are included but to exclude extragalactic quasars and unresolved galaxies which appear in increasing numbers for @xmath16 @xmath4 17 .    even though @xmath16 magnitudes had to be used to define the initial search for sources , because these are the magnitudes tabulated in the catalogs , @xmath16 photometry in the botes and fls surveys is unreliable for many of the brighter stars ( @xmath16 @xmath1 15 ) because the images are saturated . in order to have consistent and reliable magnitudes over the full range of magnitudes",
    "selected , our final tabulation of sources uses sdss @xmath9 mag .",
    "inclusion of a source in our final list as a galactic star ( which we also call `` stellar '' objects below ) requires sdss @xmath9 @xmath10 17 , requires that the source be unresolved in optical images , and requires that the source not be included in any existing list of quasars .    in the botes survey area",
    ", there are 2853 sources with f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) @xmath4 1 mjy . of these ,",

    "the objective of our study is to identify excess infrared continuum emission which exceeds that expected from the stellar photosphere . determining the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and temperature distribution of the material producing the infrared excess requires detailed modeling of the stellar atmospheres and subsequent measures of the deviations from such a model at various wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the objective is only to identify stars with infrared excesses without determining in detail the spectrum of the excess , this identification can be done in a straightforward , empirical way with limited photometry .",

    "this method for determining 24@xmath3 m  excesses in stars compares colors @xmath11-@xmath7 with colors @xmath7-[24 ] ; magnitude at 24@xmath3 m  is defined as [ 24 ] with zero magnitude of the mips f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) corresponding to 7300 mjy @xcite . as pointed out by gorlova et al .",
    ", this method works because pure photospheric emission leads to @xmath7-[24 ] = 0 , virtually independent of spectral type through type k. this constant color arises because both the @xmath7 and [ 24 ] bands are on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the spectral energy distribution so that the @xmath7-[24 ] color for stars hotter than type m has little dependence on stellar temperature .",

    "the observations and stellar models in @xcite demonstrate , however , that m stars are sufficiently cool that they can show colors ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 from photospheric continuum alone . although we identify such m stars in the following analysis , we do not include them as sources with real 24 @xmath3 m  excesses .",
    "the validity of this simple criterion can be tested using the stars identified in @xcite and @xcite as having excesses at 24 @xmath3 m  arising from debris disks , as determined from comparison of f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) to the photospheric f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) expected from flux densities at other wavelengths .",

    "for all of the stars listed in @xcite and @xcite , we have taken the archival 2mass data and compared to the 24 @xmath3 m  data in these papers .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7-[24 ] colors for the stars with excesses given in meyer et al is shown in the lowest panel of figure 1 .",
    "it can be seen from this plot that ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 mag is a conservative definition of excess , because some of the stars with excesses have @xmath7-[24 ] as small as 0.15 .    for the results in @xcite ,",

    "127 of our 128 stars in botes and 139 of 140 in the fls have @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and k magnitudes from 2mass , so the ( @xmath11-@xmath7 ) , ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) color - color comparison is easily done . results for the botes stars and fls stars are also shown in figure 1 .",
    "because 3@xmath14 uncertainties in the botes and fls data are @xmath1 0.2 mjy , we identify those stars with ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 mag . as stars with possible excesses . using this definition of excess , there are 13 such stars in botes and also 13 in the fls . while in some cases , the observed excesses may arise because of sources being at extremes of the error , this definition of excess is justified by noting in figure 1 that there is more extended dispersion of the points with ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0 than for ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath10 0 .",
    "if the observed excesses arise simply from a distribution of errors , the positive and negative distributions should be similar .    the stars with infrared excesses defined by ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 mag .",
    "are identified in figure 1 according to their listing in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the most extreme is source 107 in botes , but this is a known variable star @xcite , so the observed excess may arise because the @xmath7 was different when [ 24 ] was measured than the @xmath7 at the 2mass observing epoch . in principle , variability could account for the apparent excess found in any star , but this is the only star with identified excess which is a known variable .",
    "if variability does explain apparent 24 @xmath3 m  excesses , we would expect a similar number of variable stars which show apparent 24 @xmath3 m  `` deficiencies '' ( i.e. @xmath7-[24 ] @xmath10 -0.2 mag . ) . of the total sample of 266 botes and fls stars in figure 1 ,",
    "only two show 24 @xmath3 m  deficiencies ; this implies statistically that most of the observed excesses are real and not caused by source variability .",
    "not counting the variable source 107 , there remain 12 stars in botes and 13 in the fls with 0.2 @xmath10 ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath10 0.7 .",
    "these are the stars which we identify as candidates for having real infrared excesses at 24 @xmath3 m  and discuss further below in section 3 .    except for the measurement uncertainty , there is only one other source of uncertainty regarding the reality of the measured excesses .",
    "this is the question of whether the observed 24@xmath3 m  excess might arise from a faint , background galaxy which produces some of the f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) but is not visible in optical or 2mass images because of the bright star .",
    "for the 26 stars with excesses , a comparison of the 24@xmath3 m  coordinates with the 2mass coordinates yields a median difference of 0.7   between coordinates .",
    "this means that any extragalactic source which confuses the f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) has to be located precisely at the stellar position and not simply somewhere within the @xmath8 5   beam size of the mips survey camera .",
    "the probability of such a coincidence by chance is extremely small .",
    "we estimate this using the principle that a random source producing the apparent excess should have a minimum f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) which is 20% of the photospheric f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) ( in order to produce an apparent @xmath7-[24 ] excess of 0.2 mag . ) .",
    "the faintest sources , f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) @xmath8 1 mjy , are most susceptible to such confusion , so we determine the probability that a faint source of f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) @xmath4 0.2 mjy is randomly located within @xmath8 1   of a given position . to f@xmath2(24 @xmath3",
    "m ) = 0.2 mjy , there are @xmath8 6x10@xmath18 sources deg@xmath19 @xcite , so the probability of having a random source within an area of 1   radius is 1.4x10@xmath20 . for a 5 mjy star , requiring coincidental excess of 1 mjy ,",
    "the probability of a 1 mjy random source is 8x10@xmath21 using our observed source density in botes of 350 sources deg@xmath19 to 1 mjy .",
    "previous targeted observations using @xmath5 have enabled extensive studies of circumstellar material associated with a wide variety of stars .",
    "objectives range from probing the formation and evolution of planetary systems ( feps , e.g. meyer et al .",
    "2006 ) to understanding dust formation in evolved stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a primary goal of the feps studies is to determine the frequency and nature of debris disks surrounding stars similar in luminosity and age to the sun in order to place our solar system in context of other similar stars .",
    "knowledge regarding the luminosity of such disks is also crucial in planning eventual efforts to image terrestrial planets because bright zodiacal emission associated with a planetary system is a fundamental limitation to such imaging @xcite .",
    "our observations were not designed to target any particular type of star but only to give an unbiased survey of 24 @xmath3 m  excesses .",
    "we are seeking primarily a statistical result that applies to a sample of field stars chosen without any prior knowledge of their stellar characteristics . explaining the individual origins of these infrared excesses requires more information for each star .",
    "it is especially crucial to know which stars are main sequence stars , because giants with excesses can be explained by dust having been produced and ejected in the extended stellar atmosphere .    for determining the spectral classification of sources in botes",
    ", we initially utilized the dfbs , a low resolution objective prism survey of the sky originally used primarily to discover markarian galaxies .",
    "( the fls field is not currently included within the dfbs . )",
    "these classifications provided the initial indication that the great majority of these stars are of f , g , and k spectral types .",
    "the dfbs can not provide luminosity classifications , and the stars in tables 1 and 2 are not sufficiently bright that other spectroscopic classifications have been made . at present , our only way to estimate which stars are main sequence is to use available data on proper motions to estimate luminosity limits .",
    "the proper motion data are from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite ( when available ) or us naval observatory - b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "our estimate uses 50 km / s as an upper limit for @xmath22 to calculate the maximum distances and upper limits for luminosity .",
    "for example , a star with proper motion of 100 mas / yr should be at a distance less than 100 pc ; for apparent @xmath23 = 15 , this requires absolute magnitude @xmath24 @xmath4 10.0 .",
    "any star with @xmath24 @xmath4 4 determined with this limit is assigned as main sequence ( luminosity class v in tables 1 and 2 . )",
    "this is a relaxed limit because @xmath22 may be smaller than the limit used , so many stars without an assignment to class v may also be main sequence stars .",
    "we also include in tables 1 and 2 the optical @xmath0 magnitudes from the tycho catalog or , as noted in the tables , from the hubble space telescope guide star catalog , v. 2.3.2 @xcite for the minority of stars not having tycho measurements .",
    "using the @xmath0 magnitudes allows a consistent spectral classification for both botes and fls fields , by assigning a spectral class using the @xmath0-@xmath7 colors of the stars compared to the relation between this color and spectral type .",
    "we have determined an empirical transformation between ( @xmath0-@xmath7 ) and spectral type using the stars in @xcite and @xcite together with the m stars in @xcite .",
    "this transformation is shown in figure 2 .",
    "spectral subclasses are not used after m0 because the relation is not well - calibrated ; stars redder than ( @xmath0-@xmath7 ) @xmath4 4.5 are listed in the tables only as m stars .",
    "as discussed in section 2.3 , we use the criterion ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 mag to select those stars with excess luminosity at 24 @xmath3 m  compared to the luminosity arising from the stellar photosphere .",
    "@xcite show , however , that this criterion does not work for m stars because such stars are sufficiently cool that a color ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 can arise just from the photosphere . from figure 1 in gautier et al . , a photospheric ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 arises for stars with ( @xmath0-@xmath7 ) @xmath15 4.0 ; these are the m stars shown our figure 2 .      in figure 3 for botes stars and in figure 4 for fls stars ,",
    "we show the distributions of ( @xmath0-@xmath7 ) for the stars in tables 1 and 2 and identify those 26 stars with excesses which are shown in figure 1 . from the colors shown in figures 3 and 4 , we reject any m star with ( @xmath0-@xmath7 ) @xmath4 4.0 as having a real excess of luminosity above the photospheric luminosity .",
    "this removes 4 stars from botes ( stars 39 , 76 , 119 , and 125 in table 1 ) and 4 stars from the fls ( stars 55 , 84 , 89 , and 136 in table 2 ) from the list of stars whose ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) color can be taken as evidence of a real 24 @xmath3 m  excess . the remaining 18 stars with excesses ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 are all f , g , or k stars .",
    "one of these 18 is a known variable star , source 107 in table 1 , so we do not include it as a candidate for a real excess .",
    "we discuss only the remaining 17 stars and refer to these as the fgk stars with excesses .",
    "the upper limits on luminosities estimated from proper motions yield a lower limit for the number of fgk main sequence stars in botes and the fls because other stars could also be main sequence stars without large proper motions .",

    "of the 17 fgk stars identified with 24 @xmath3 m  excesses , 8 of the 17 are main sequence based only on this limited criterion of proper motion , which gives a total fraction 8/92 ( 9% ) of main sequence fgk stars which have excesses .",
    "an independent estimate for which stars are main sequence stars derives by considering the magnitudes of the stars , as giants would be expected to appear systematically brighter .",
    "this comparison is shown in figures 3 and 4 for botes and the fls .",
    "both diagrams show that most stars identified as having ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 ( open circles ) are among the faintest stars of a given spectral type ( i.e. of a given @xmath0-@xmath7 color ) . in figures 3 and 4",
    "combined , only three stars with ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath4 0.2 are above this trend , and these three are all m stars based on having ( @xmath0-@xmath7 ) @xmath4 4.0 .",
    "all of the 17 fgk stars identified with 24 @xmath3 m  excesses in botes and the fls fall on the lower envelope of @xmath0 mag . in figures 3 and 4 , implying that all 17 are main sequence stars ; only 8 of these 17 are classified as main sequence stars in tables 1 and 2 as determined from proper motions .",
    "adding these additional 9 fgk main sequence stars to the total of 92 fgk main sequence stars determined from proper motions yields a lower limit to the total number of fgk main sequence stars in the combined samples of tables 1 and 2 of 101 , of which 17 have 24 @xmath3 m  excesses .",
    "the upper limit to the number of fgk main sequence stars is the entire sample of 141 fgk stars in tables 1 and 2 . these results for estimating the main sequence stars based only on apparent magnitudes , therefore , yield limits to the fraction of main sequence stars with 24 @xmath3 m  excesses as somewhere between 17/141 ( 12% ) and 17/101 ( 17% ) .",
    "combining these limits derived from apparent magnitudes with the fraction of 9% determined above using only proper motions , we can conclude that the fraction of main sequence fgk field stars with 24 @xmath3 m  excesses determined from comparison of 2mass near - infrared and @xmath5 mid - infrared continuum flux densities is between 9% and 17% .",
    "these results are similar to the 10% fraction of main sequence stars identified with excesses from debris disks by @xcite and the 15% fraction by @xcite , so it is reasonable to conclude that most of the excesses we have identified arise from debris disks in main sequence stars .",
    "surveys at high galactic latitude at 24@xmath3 m  with the @xmath5 mips instrument are used in a serendipitous study of bright galactic stars with detections at 24@xmath3 m .",
    "268 stars with @xmath0 @xmath1 13 mag . and f@xmath2(24 @xmath3 m ) @xmath4",
    "1mjy are identified within 14 deg@xmath6 of the combined ndwfs botes field and fls field . using a comparison with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath7 magnitudes from the 2mass survey",
    ", it is found that 17 fgk stars have excesses 0.2 @xmath10 ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) @xmath10 0.7 compared to the expected ( @xmath7-[24 ] ) = 0.0 for stellar photospheres ; i.e. the luminosity observed in the mid - infrared at 24 @xmath3 m  exceeds the photospheric luminosity by at least 20% .    for main sequence stars ,",
    "such excesses are attributed primarily to debris disks .",
    "at least 8 of the 17 fgk stars with excesses are identified as main sequence stars based on proper motions ; all 17 would be estimated as main sequence stars based only on distributions of apparent magnitude . depending on how many stars in the total sample",
    "really are main sequence stars , the fraction of main sequence field stars with excess luminosity at 24 @xmath3 m  in botes and the fls is between 9% and 17% .",
    "these results are comparable to the 7% fraction for 69 bright fgk main sequence field stars in @xcite with 24 @xmath3 m  excess , to the 9% fraction of 53 pleiades fgk stars with excesses in @xcite , to the 10% fraction of solar - like stars with excesses in @xcite , and the 15% fraction in @xcite .    within the uncertainties of the small number statistics , therefore , the botes and fls surveys of galactic stars find a similar fraction of main sequence stars with mid - infrared excesses as found among brighter , targeted field stars . at present",
    ", however , a more quantitative result for botes and fls stars requires additional observations .",
    "none of these stars have distance determinations through parallax measurements ; the existing spectral classifications do not give luminosity classifications or determinations of variability ; and we can not rule out binary companions on a scale smaller than the resolution of the available images .",
    "further observations of the individual stars are needed , therefore , to determine other possible sources of the identified excesses .",
    "our study primarily demonstrates the utility of combining @xmath5 surveys at 24@xmath3 m  with 2mass data for bright stars to accumulate a meaningful sample of galactic stars with apparent 24@xmath3 m  excesses .",
    "such unbiased , statistical samples of untargeted field stars should prove useful to eventual understanding of debris disks associated with solar - like stars and to discovering other explanations of mid - infrared excess luminosity .",
