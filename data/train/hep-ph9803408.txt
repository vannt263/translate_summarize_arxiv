    "it is now well established that the hbt correlations @xcite influence significantly the momentum distribution of particles created in high - energy collisions . the effect on multiplicity distributions and on particle ratios , however , although predicted theoretically @xcite @xcite , has not yet been found in accelerator experiments @xcite . in view of the increasing interest in measurements of multiplicity distributions in future collider experiments , we found it worthwhile to reexamine this problem once more .",
    "we begin by reviewing the basic ideas of the hbt effect , as applied to processes of particle production .",
    "this will permit to explain our assumptions and to introduce the notation .",
    "let @xmath0 be the probability amplitude for the production of n particles with momenta @xmath1 \\equiv q$ ] _ calculated ignoring the identity of particles_. here @xmath2 denotes a collection of all other quantum numbers which may be relevant to the process in question ( e.g. , the momenta of other particles which we do not wish to consider explicitly in a `` semi - inclusive '' measurement ) .",
    "the density matrix @xmath3 gives all the available information about the system in question .",
    "in particular , the momentum spectrum of particles is @xmath4 in the following we shall assume that @xmath5 is normalized to 1 : @xmath6 suppose now that the particles are identical .",
    "in this case the states with different permutation of particle momenta are non - distinguishable and the wave function is a sum over all permutations @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the set of momenta @xmath1 $ ] ordered according to the permutation @xmath9 of @xmath10 $ ] . using ( [ 1])-([3 ] )",
    "we obtain for the distribution of momenta of identical particles @xmath11 the factor @xmath12 takes care of the fact that the phase - space for @xmath13 identical particles is @xmath14 times smaller than the phase - space of the non - identical ones .    eq.([4",
    "] ) summarizes the effect of the identity of particles on the observed spectra .",
    "it is seen that to evaluate this effect it is not enough to know the spectrum @xmath5 .",
    "the full density matrix @xmath15 is necessary .",
    "inverting this statement we observe that the measurements of the spectra of identical particles provide information on the density matrix @xmath15 , inaccessible otherwise .",
    "this is , in fact , the reason why these measurements are are so attractive .",
    "there are three points worth observing in ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "\\(i ) when momenta of all particles are equal , we obtain the simple result @xmath16    \\(ii ) the normalization of @xmath17 is different from that of @xmath5 .",
    "generally we have @xmath18 since the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath5 depends on @xmath13 , the hbt effect affects not only the shape of momentum spectrum but also the multiplicity distribution .",
    "this aspect of the problem is the subject of the present investigation .",
    "\\(iii ) if particles are emitted in a pure state , i.e. , if @xmath19 and if @xmath20 is symmetric with respect to interchange of any pair of momenta , we have @xmath21 a really dramatic result . is the spectrum calculated with _",
    "identity of particles being ignored_. some authors @xcite , while discussing the hbt effect for pure states , include the identity of particles already in calculation of @xmath5 . in this case one",
    "obtains of course @xmath22 . ]",
    "consider now a system of @xmath13 particles emitted independently .",
    "if we ignore the identity of particles , independent emission implies that the density matrix factorizes @xmath23 introducing this into ( [ 4 ] ) we have @xmath24 here we are interested in the integral @xmath25 to calculate @xmath26 we observe that , for each permutation @xmath9 the integral on the right hand side of ( [ 9 ] ) factorizes into a product of contributions from all the cycles of p ( as is well - known , each permutation can be decomposed into cycles ) .",
    "let us denote the contribution from a cycle of length @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "we have @xmath29 it follows from ( [ 2a ] ) that @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath28 depends on the form of @xmath15 and can not be calculated without further assumptions .",
    "one can prove , however , that all @xmath28 are positive .",
    "indeed , one sees from ( [ 10 ] ) that @xmath32^k .",
    "\\label{10a}\\ ] ] since @xmath15 , being a density matrix , has only non - negative eigenvalues and trace one , @xmath33 .",
    "the rest of the calculation is just combinatorics .",
    "we observe first that any two permutations which have identical partitions into cycles give equal contributions . denoting by @xmath34 the number of occurences of a cycle of lenght @xmath27 in the set of permutations considered",
    ", the contribution from all of them can be written as @xmath35^{n_k}\\frac1{n_k ! } = n!\\prod_{k=1}^n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{c_k}{k}\\right)^{n_k}}{n_k!}.   \\label{11}\\ ] ] in the first equality the first factor is the integral , the second is the number of partitions of the @xmath13 particles among the cycles , the third is the number of ways a cycle can be constructed from @xmath27 particles and the last one corrects for the permutations of whole cycles .",
    "@xmath26 is obtained by summing @xmath36 only over permutations which have partitions into cycles different from each other .",
    "this still leaves a large number of terms but -for large @xmath13- this number is much smaller than the original @xmath14 .    until now we have considered a fixed multiplicity .",
    "if the multiplicity distribution calculated with identity of particles ignored is given by @xmath37 , the correct multiplicity distribution of identical particles is @xmath38 for independent emission @xmath37 is given by the poisson distribution @xmath39 and we obtain an elegant formula for the generating function of the multiplicity distribution : @xmath40",
    "in this section we discuss the general properties of the multiplicity distributions obtained from the eq.([14 ] ) .",
    "first , we observe that using well - known properties of the generating function we obtain from ( [ 14 ] ) for the average multiplicity @xmath41 and for the correlation coefficients ( cumulants ) @xmath42 all the cumulants are positive , because all the @xmath28 are .",
    "this means in particular that the distribution is always broader than the poisson one .",
    "specific properties of the distributions defined by ( [ 14 ] ) depend , of course , on the value of @xmath43 and of the cycle integrals @xmath28 .    the first important example we would like to consider is when particles are emitted in a pure state , i.e. @xmath44 it follows from ( [ 10 ] ) that @xmath45 for all @xmath27 and the generating function becomes @xmath46 corresponding to the geometric distribution @xmath47 which , at the critical point @xmath48 , exhibits the phenomenon of einstein condensation .",
    "one sees from this example that the resulting multiplicity distribution has little to do with the original poisson one , and the observed average multiplicity may dramatically differ from the initial @xmath43 .",
    "as we shall see , this is a general phenomenon .",
    "further discussion depends on the assumed shape of the single - particle density matrix .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath28 is greatly simplified if one works in the basis where the density matrix @xmath15 is diagonal .",
    "let us first discuss the case of a discrete eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "we have    @xmath49    and thus the generating function of the multiplicity distribution can be represented as a product @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the generating functions of the geometric distribution ( if the eigenvalue @xmath52 is degenerate , the corresponding factor in ( [ 19h ] ) appears @xmath53 times , where @xmath53 is the degeneration factor ) .    thus we obtain the average multiplicity @xmath54 and the cumulants @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath15 .",
    "one sees that @xmath57 is the critical point of the multiplicity distribution ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us now discuss the case when the eigenvalue spectrum is continuous . denoting by @xmath58 the eigenvalues of @xmath15 and by @xmath59 the spectral function we have @xmath60",
    "the normalization condition ( [ 2a ] ) implies that @xmath61    one sees that the problem reduces to a discussion of a single non - negative function @xmath59 defined in the interval @xmath62 $ ] and satisfying the condition ( [ 19b ] ) .",
    "we also note that the eigenvalues equal to zero do not contribute to @xmath28 .",
    "one can thus always add to @xmath59 a term of the form @xmath63 ( with an arbitrary positive constant @xmath64 ) without changing the results .    to be more specific , we consider the generic spectral function in the form @xmath65 for @xmath66 and zero otherwise .",
    "we obtain @xmath67 and the cumulants @xmath68 the hypergeometric function @xmath69 becomes singular at @xmath70 when @xmath71 exceeds @xmath72 .",
    "three special cases are of interest :    \\(i ) @xmath73 . in this case",
    "@xmath74 and we have @xmath75 . thus @xmath76 and we recognize the negative binomial distribution with the average @xmath77 .",
    "for @xmath78 we recover the poisson distribution ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , @xmath79 corresponds to the pure state @xmath45 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath80 .",
    "now we have @xmath81 and one finds the following formula for the cumulants of the distribution @xmath82 from the know properties of the hypergeometric function @xcite we deduce that at the critical point @xmath83 , @xmath84 diverges logarithmically , whereas all other cumulants diverge as negative powers of @xmath85 .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the average multiplicity approaches @xmath87 at the critical point @xmath83 .",
    "the divergences appear only in cumulants of order @xmath88 .",
    "such a distribution is characterized by a large probability of no particles at all , accompanied by a small probablity of production of very many particles .",
    "schematically @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the average of the distribution @xmath91 .",
    "to summarize , the distribution becomes always singular when @xmath92 ( i.e. the product of the initial average multiplicity and the maximal eigenvalue of the density matrix ) approaches @xmath93 .",
    "the character of the singularity at this critical point , however , depends crucially on the behaviour of the spectral function in the vicinity of @xmath56 .",
    "in this section we consider the single particle density matrix of the gaussian form , discussed already in several papers by pratt @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath94 with @xmath95 where @xmath96 analogous formulae define @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "as easily seen , @xmath99 is the average value of the square of the @xmath100-component of the particle momentum , and @xmath101 is the average value of the square of the @xmath100-coordinate of the particle emission point .",
    "the uncertainty principle implies that for @xmath102 , @xmath103    in order to determine the multiplicity distribution , we first find the eigenvalues of the density matrix ( [ 21 ] ) . to this end",
    "we observe that the eigenfunctions of ( [ 21 ] ) are of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the hermite polynomial of order @xmath106 . using ( [ 32a ] ) it is not difficult to find the eigenvalues : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and for @xmath109 @xmath110 note that ( [ 21 * ] ) implies that @xmath111 , as necessary .",
    "the generating function is given by ( [ 19h]),([19i ] ) and the cumulants by ( [ 19j ] ) with @xmath52 given by ( [ 32b ] ) .",
    "using ( [ 32b ] ) and following the arguments of the previous section we also obtain the elegant formula @xmath112[(1 - 1- \\lambda_y)^k][1-(1- \\lambda_z)^k]}. \\label{32c}\\ ] ] together with ( [ 16 ] ) , this gives for the cumulants @xmath113[1-(1- \\lambda_y)^k][(1-\\lambda_z)^k ] } , \\label{32d}\\ ] ] which diverges , as expected , at @xmath114 .",
    "it was first pointed out by pratt @xcite that studies of the charge ratios may be an effective way to uncover the effects of hbt correlations in multiparticle systems .",
    "this issue can be readily treated using the methods developped in sectons 3 and 4 .",
    "we would like to discuss independent production of positive , negative and neutral pions .",
    "the main difficulty in formulating the problem is how to implement the constraint of charge conservation , as this clearly depends on the dynamics of the production process ( a thorough discussion can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to two cases which , we believe , illustrate well the main point : the charge ratios obtained may drastically differ from those expected from the `` uncorrected '' distributions .    in the first case",
    "the constraint of charge conservation is ignored altogether .",
    "this may be justified if the system of particles we consider is a small part of a very large system . for the generating function of multiplicity distribution",
    "we thus obtain simply @xmath115 where @xmath116 is is the generating function of the multiplicity distribution of one of the species . introducing @xmath117",
    "we have @xmath118 from this equation one can obtain the full joint distribution of charged and neutral pions by the usual methods . for illustration",
    "we just quote the results for two extreme cases @xmath119 ( `` centauros '' ) and @xmath120 ( `` anticentauros '' ) : @xmath121 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{42b}\\ ] ] using now the results of the previous section we have @xmath122 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{42c}\\ ] ] one immediate consequence is that the production of `` centauros '' must be larger than that of `` anticentauros '' . for the gaussian density matrix",
    "we obtain , according to ( [ 32b ] ) , @xmath123 . \\label{43}\\ ] ]    the second case we consider is when the charged particles are produced in pairs , i.e. , the distribution is of the form @xmath124 ^ 2 p(n_0)}{\\sum_m[p(m)]^2}. \\label{44}\\ ] ] thus for production of `` centauros '' we obtain the same formula as before .",
    "the generating function reads @xmath125 where @xmath126 ^ 2z_c^{n_c } } { \\sum_m[p(m)]^2}. \\label{45}\\ ] ] the probabilty of creating an `` anticentuaro '' is @xmath127 ^ 2 } { \\sum_m[p(m)]^2 } >   [ \\phi(0)]^2 \\label{46}\\ ] ] and thus the production of `` anticentauros '' is enhanced as compared to the previous case .",
    "these results are illustrated in fig.1 , where the probability of the occurence of a `` centauro '' , @xmath128 , given by ( [ 43 ] ) , is plotted versus the average multiplicity of the system considered for different values of the parameter @xmath129 , which determines the maximal eigenvalue @xmath56 through the relation ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "one sees that for @xmath130 this probability remains substantial even for rather large values of the total multiplicity . with increasing @xmath129",
    ", however , it drops pretty fast even at moderate values of the average multiplicity .",
    "one sees from the results of the previous sections that the effects of quantum interference can modify substantially the multiplicity distributions expected naively from an uncorrelated emission of `` distinguishable '' particles .",
    "the modifications become spectacular when the system of particles approaches the critical point : the multiplicity distribution becomes very broad and does not resemble in any way the original poisson distribution characteristic of uncorrelated emission .",
    "this means in particular that one expects relatively large probabilities for unusual configurations such as `` centauro '' or `` anticentauro '' events .",
    "it is thus interesting to discuss the physical conditions for these phenomena to occur .",
    "considering the example of the gaussian density matrix , it is seen from fig.1 that the behaviour of the system is mainly determined by the parameter @xmath129 and that spectacular effects in charge ratios occur when @xmath129 is of order @xmath93 or smaller ( as already noted , c.f . (",
    "[ 21 * ] ) , @xmath131 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath132 implies , for large multiplicity , either a very large particle and energy density ( when @xmath133 is small and @xmath134 takes its `` canonical '' value of @xmath135 ) , or a `` canonical '' energy density of about @xmath136 gev/@xmath137 and a very small average momentum of the particles in the c.m . of the system . to be more specific",
    ", a system of 100 pions satisfying ( [ 47 ] ) at @xmath138 mev would correspond to the energy density of about @xmath139gev/4@xmath140gev/@xmath137 . on the other hand , for an energy density of about @xmath93 gev/@xmath137 ( and thus @xmath133 correspondingly larger )",
    ", @xmath134 should not exceed 100 mev .    clearly , the probability of creating a `` centauro '' is enhanced if both effects cooperate .",
    "we thus conclude that ( a ) the probabilty of creating a `` centauro '' is enhanced in an environment of high energy density and that the pions emerging from the `` centauros '' are likely to exibit abnormally small relative momenta .",
    "finally , let us stress the crucial role played in this analysis by the `` original '' poisson multiplicity distribution @xmath37 and by the reference density matrix @xmath15 for the distinguishable particles .",
    "this distribution is easily identified when working with feynman diagrams , but it is undefined experimentally . in order to extract the hbt effect from experiment , one would like to compare the data with a reference distribution where the hbt effect has been switched off .",
    "the problem , how to define operationally this reference distribution has been discussed for many years without a generally accepted conclusion @xcite , for a review c.f .",
    "@xcite . consequently",
    ", it is not possible to check separately the assumptions about @xmath15 , @xmath37 and the analysis of the hbt effect . in the present paper we have chosen simple , but rather general , assumptions about @xmath141 , @xmath142 and concentrated on the hbt effect .",
    "no doubt , however , more work remains to be done in order to find a realistic `` distribution of distinguishable particles '' @xmath143 .",
