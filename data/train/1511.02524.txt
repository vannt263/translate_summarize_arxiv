    "a plethora of astrophysical and cosmological observations have firmly established that non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) must exist in our universe , and contribute to the overall cosmological energy density about five times more than ordinary matter . however , none of the particles of the standard model ( sm ) can account for the dm , which therefore constitutes a clear hint of new physics .",
    "colorless , electrically neutral and weakly interacting massive particles with mass in the gev - tev range are ubiquitous in new physics models , and appear to be well suited to reproduce quantitatively the measured dm energy density if their stability on cosmological time scales can be ensured .",
    "+ from the model - building point of view , dm stability is most commonly enforced by assuming some suitable symmetry that forbids its decay into lighter sm particles .",
    "for example , in supersymmetric models this role is played by r - parity that stabilizes the lightest supersymmetric state , in universal extra dimensional models conservation of kaluza - klein parity ensures that the lightest kaluza - klein state remains stable  @xcite , @xmath8-parity stabilizes the lightest @xmath8-odd particle in the littlest higgs model  @xcite , suitable @xmath9 parities play the same role e.g. in the scotogenic model @xcite , in the inert doublet model  @xcite , and in several other cases .",
    "often these stabilizing symmetries are just imposed by hand on the low energy lagrangian , and it is certainly more satisfactory when their origin can be traced back to some high energy completion of the model in question . a plausible way to generate unbroken discrete @xmath10 symmetries relies on assuming extra gauged @xmath11 abelian factors which are only broken by order parameters carrying @xmath12 units of the @xmath11 charge  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "such a mechanism renders grand unified theories ( guts ) based on gauge groups of rank larger than four particularly interesting , since they contain extra cartan generators besides the @xmath13 of the @xmath14 sm gauge group that , when broken by vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of scalars in appropriate representations , yield discrete @xmath10 symmetries which inherit all the good properties of the parent local gauge symmetry . in particular , this type of symmetries remain protected from gravity induced symmetry breaking effects  @xcite which , although suppressed by the planck scale , could jeopardize dm stability  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting gut groups that allows to preserve at low energies an unbroken discrete gauge parity is the rank five group @xmath0 .",
    "as is well known , @xmath0 has many theoretically appealing properties : it unifies all sm fermions in a single @xmath15 dimensional irreducible representation including one right handed ( rh ) neutrino , it can explain the suppression of neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism  @xcite , it allows for gauge coupling unification at a sufficiently high scale to account for proton stability , and is automatically free from gauge anomalies . in this paper we focus on a @xmath0 gut model in which the breaking to the sm gauge group is driven by vevs of scalars in the @xmath16 representation .",
    "it has been recently shown that this model is compatible with unification  @xcite , and that it can fit all charged fermion masses and mixings as well as the low energy neutrino data  @xcite , while simultaneously explaining the cosmological baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see if this framework can also accommodate automatically stable dm candidates in the fundamental @xmath1 dimensional representation of the group .",
    "@xmath0 is a rank five group and thus with respect to the sm model it contains one additional cartan generator that , upon breaking of the unified group , can give rise to a new @xmath11 gauge group factor .",
    "the @xmath11 charges of the component fields are conventionally normalized by setting the smallest charge equal to one .",
    "then , if @xmath11 is further broken by vevs of scalars carrying @xmath17 units of charge with @xmath18 as their greatest common divisor , a discrete center @xmath19 remains unbroken  @xcite .",
    "with vevs in tensor representations can result in an unbroken @xmath9 parity was already pointed out in  @xcite , in relation to the possible appearance of extended topological structures of cosmological relevance .",
    "we thank q. shafi for bringing this reference to our attention . ] in our setup @xmath0 is broken to @xmath20 by vevs of scalars in @xmath21 , which are all @xmath0 tensor representations .",
    "with respect to the non - sm @xmath11 factor singled out in the maximal subgroup @xmath22 , which is the one whose breaking gives rise to the gauge discrete symmetry , all @xmath0 tensor representations branch to @xmath22 fragments which have even values of the @xmath11 charge .",
    "the lowest charge value for the fragments acquiring vevs is 2 [ e.g. : @xmath23 and therefore a @xmath24 parity survives , which can guarantee the stability of the lightest particles belonging to appropriately chosen representations .",
    "restricting to dimensions @xmath25 we have that , depending if they are fermions or bosons , stable particles appear in the following representations  @xcite : @xmath26 for example , fermions in the vector @xmath27 can not decay into sm fermions in the @xmath15 since this is a spinorial representation for which all fragments under @xmath22 carry odd @xmath11 charges and upon @xmath11 breaking then acquire odd @xmath24 parity .",
    "various proposals for @xmath0 dm candidates that are stabilized by the @xmath9 parity of gauge origin have been put forth in the recent literature : a dedicated analysis of scalar dm in the @xmath28 was carried out in  @xcite , while the possibility of fermionic dm in the @xmath29 was addressed in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite where the @xmath29 is allowed to mix with a @xmath1 ) .",
    "other more general studies regarding possible embeddings of dm in @xmath0 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , so far a special attention has been devoted to dm in the scalar @xmath28 and in the fermionic @xmath29 , and a possible reason for this might be the fact that both these representations contain sm singlets .",
    "needless to say , identifying dm candidates with sm singlets can naturally explain why all experimental direct detection ( dd ) searches have been eluded so far . in contrast ,",
    "the @xmath1 dimensional vector representation of @xmath0 has not attracted much attention , although this could well be considered as the minimal choice .",
    "perhaps this is due to the fact that the @xmath1 does not contain sm singlets , and in particular all its states carry hypercharge , and thus couple to the @xmath30 boson , which might led to the conclusion that this possibility is excluded by dd limits .",
    "+ in this letter we argue that fermionic dm in the @xmath1 of @xmath0 is instead a viable possibility .",
    "our main observation is that in a scenario in which fermions in a vectorlike @xmath31 acquire tree level masses via a yukawa coupling with the ( antisymmetric ) @xmath32 , loop diagrams involving an insertion of @xmath33-@xmath34 mixing produce a mass splitting between the two lightest mass eigenstates , which ( in our minimal realization ) are two neutral dirac fermions .",
    "we show that the neutral @xmath6 gauge bosons couple non - diagonally the light eigenstate to the heavier one and , as a result , at the leading order only inelastic neutral current scatterings of dm off target nuclei is allowed .",
    "if the mass splitting between the light and heavy mass eigenstates is larger than the typical dm kinetic energy @xmath35 , then the scattering is kinematically forbidden and dd bounds are automatically evaded .",
    "since the loop - induced splitting is suppressed by the rh gauge boson mass , the previous requirement can be translated into an upper - bound on @xmath36 which , combined with the lower bounds from flavour and cp violating processes in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 meson systems  @xcite and from direct searches at the lhc  @xcite , results in @xmath39 . the fact that the null result of dd dm searches constrains @xmath40 to lie at a relatively low scale , can reinforce the hope that a rich phenomenology could be within the reach of the lhc .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is broken at the unification scale to the intermediate group @xmath41 by the vev of a @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath42 is then broken at an intermediate scale @xmath43 to the sm gauge group @xmath44 by the vev of @xmath45 , and finally @xmath46 is broken by electroweak doublet vevs in a ( complexified ) @xmath47 down to @xmath48 : so(10 ) & & 3_c 2_l 2_r",

    "( [ bc ] ) we have introduced for the gauge groups the short - hand notation e.g. @xmath49 , and together with the unbroken continuous gauge symmetries we have also written down the discrete @xmath9 factor which survives down to the last breaking step . although the gut symmetry breaking triggered by an adjoint @xmath32 together with a @xmath45 develops instabilities at the tree level , it has been recently shown that the inclusion of quantum corrections can solve this problem and make the model viable  @xcite . the first symmetry breaking is achieved via the @xmath50 singlet contained in the @xmath51 .",
    "the second step is driven by a @xmath52 vev in the sm singlet direction which also provides majorana masses for the rh neutrinos , and the last step is driven by the vevs of electroweak doublets contained in the @xmath47 . note that while a real @xmath47 is sufficient to drive the @xmath53 symmetry breaking , a @xmath47 containing complex fields is needed to reproduce realistic fermion masses  @xcite and in particular to accommodate the @xmath54 mass ratio . moreover , to reproduce the complete charged fermion mass spectrum accounting also for yukawa non - unification of the lepton and down - type quarks of the first two generations , a contribution from the vevs of the electroweak doublets appearing in the @xmath45 is also necessary  @xcite .",
    "these vevs are unavoidably induced when @xmath55 is broken by the @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "all in all , the masses of the sm fermions are generated from the following yukawa terms : - l_= @xmath57_i ( h_ij @xmath58_h + g_ij @xmath58^*_h + f_ij @xmath59_h ) @xmath57_j , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are @xmath63 symmetric matrices in flavour space and @xmath64 are family indices .",
    "the fermion couplings to @xmath65 can be forbidden by assigning to the fields a global @xmath11 peccei - quinn charge  @xcite . in practice",
    "this sets @xmath66 , simplifying the yukawa structure of the model , and providing a dm candidate for non - supersymmetric @xmath0 models in the form of axions . in the spirit of avoiding the introduction of additional symmetries , and given that we are interested in a weakly interacting dm candidate , we will not follow this route , and we allow for @xmath67 .",
    "possible fcnc arising from coupling quarks of the same type to two different higgs doublets , as it would happen in this situation , can be kept under control in various ways e.g. by assuming a hierarchy @xmath68 .",
    "+      let us now add to the @xmath0 model outlined above a pair of fundamentals @xmath31 containing new fermions . and @xmath69 chiralities with calligraphic subscripts ( @xmath70 ) , while normal subscripts ( @xmath71 ) label the @xmath72 gauge group factors . ]",
    "the tensor product of two vectors of @xmath0 is : @xmath58 @xmath58= ^s @xmath73^a ^s , where the superscripts denote @xmath74ymmetric and @xmath75ntisymmetric representations .",
    "although our model does not contain a @xmath76 of fundamental scalars , loop corrections can generate mass contributions that mimic the coupling to ( effective ) representations , as long as these couplings are allowed by the symmetries of the model . to keep as general as possible",
    "it is then convenient to write down all the allowed gauge invariant yukawa couplings , which are : - l _ & = & _ a= , @xmath58_a ( m_a+ _ a _",
    "h ) @xmath58_a + & + & , where , in order not to over - clutter the expressions , we have left understood the usual spinor notations .",
    "it is instructive to analyze these couplings in terms of representations of the @xmath77 .",
    "the branching rule for the @xmath0 vector is @xmath78 so that in the first line the invariant mass term @xmath79 multiplies the @xmath80 singlet from the product of the same @xmath81 .",
    "the second term involves the symmetric @xmath82 and , besides containing a @xmath83 coupling involving the @xmath84 adjoint , it also includes couplings of the symmetric @xmath85 to a pair of fundamentals : @xmath86 .",
    "let us note at this point that if the colorless @xmath72 triplet contained in the @xmath87 ( @xmath85 ) acquires a small vev , these terms would generate a majorana mass for the neutral components of the fermion doublets in the @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "however , the same is not true for the analogous term in the second line since it contains only terms that couple two different @xmath1 s .",
    "finally , since the @xmath90 is antisymmetric , it must couple different representations , and thus it appears only in the second line .",
    "the model we will now study is specified by the following ingredients : ( i ) the @xmath91 is absent ; ( ii ) the adjoint vev @xmath51 which can be written as : = ( a , a , a , b , b ) (    0&1 1&0    ) , acquires a dimopoulos - wilczek structure  @xcite with @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( since @xmath94 breaks @xmath95 we require @xmath96 in order to respect the symmetry breaking pattern  eq .",

    "the velocity - averaged cross - section for @xmath220 can be estimated as @xmath221 with @xmath222 the @xmath72 fine structure constant .",
    "a more accurate estimate , including non - relativistic sommerfeld corrections , gives for the same mass range an enhancement up to one order of magnitude  @xcite . in spite of this",
    "the signal remains well below the present limits @xmath223 for the mass range @xmath224  @xcite .    as regards collider limits , at the lhc the most sensitive searches in our scenario , in which @xmath225 are quasi - degenerate , are monojet signatures from processes like @xmath226 , where the pair of @xmath227 s are produced via the @xmath74-channel exchange of a sm gauge boson",
    "however , this signal is accompanied by large backgrounds from @xmath228+jets , which render the experimental search particularly difficult",
    ". a dedicated analysis of signatures of quasi - degenerate higgsino like dm , which closely resembles our scenario , indicates a surprisingly low reach @xmath229gev even for lhc-13  @xcite .",
    "we have no reason to expect that this limit could be largely exceeded in our case , so that we can conclude that even the non - resonant ( lowest mass ) dm solution with @xmath230tev remains unconstrained by collider searches . + before concluding this section ,",
    "one additional remark is in order .",
    "our dirac dm candidates carry hypercharge @xmath231 , which can be used to distinguish particles ( e.g. @xmath232 ) from antiparticles ( respectively @xmath233 ) . during their thermal history ,",
    "the @xmath227 s will unavoidably enter in chemical equilibrium with the thermal bath , inheriting an asymmetry similar to that of all sm hypercharged states .",
    "for example , in the temperature range @xmath234 ( @xmath235 denote the temperatures at which @xmath236 get broken ) that is the relevant range in which dm annihilates efficiently when the dm mass is above a few tev , processes like @xmath237 which occur as long as @xmath238 , or @xmath239 scatterings mediated by @xmath240 effective operators like @xmath241 which occur when @xmath242 , will enforce chemical equilibrium between the @xmath227 system and the sm thermal bath , and thus an asymmetry will develop in the dm sector as well .",
    "the issue whether such an asymmetry could play any relevant role in determining the final dm relic density by quenching the annihilations when the dm density becomes of the order of the density asymmetry was recently studied in  @xcite for the general case of stable relics belonging to scalar and fermion hypercharged multiplets of dimension @xmath243 .",
    "it was found that for fermion doublets , as for most of the other cases , the effects of the dm asymmetry on the surviving relic density are generally negligible . however , the results of the analysis in  @xcite rely on certain assumptions , among which : ( i ) there are no new hypercharged particles besides the multiplet in question ; ( ii ) the same operator responsible for the transfer of the asymmetry is also responsible for the mass splitting between the neutral hypercharged states .    in the present case however ,",
    "these two conditions are not satisfied : ( i ) besides the new fermions in the bi - doublets , also the charged gauge bosons @xmath5 carry hypercharge @xmath231 ; ( ii ) the loop operator that induces the mass splitting ( figure  [ fig:2 ] ) is generated only after @xmath4 breaking , while the asymmetry transfer is mediated by tree level interactions with real or virtual @xmath5 bosons , and is most efficient well above @xmath244 . moreover ,",
    "resonantly enhanced annihilation and co - annihilation , that were not present in the scenario analyzed in  @xcite , here play a very important role , and many of the solutions for the correct dm relic density are found in dm mass regions close to the gauge boson resonances .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of all these differences , given that co - annihilation via @xmath5 exchange , that is one of the dominant annihilation processes , does not suffer from any asymmetry - related quenching , it is reasonable to expect that in most of the parameter space the dm asymmetry will be largely uninfluential in determining the final value of @xmath196 .",
    "resonance could be an exception . ]",
    "breaking the @xmath0 gut group to the sm via the intermediate group @xmath245 by means of vacuum expectation values in @xmath246 preserves an exact discrete gauge symmetry @xmath9 , which ensures the stability of the lightest among new fermions belonging to @xmath1-dimensional vector representations .",
    "we have added to the @xmath0 model two fermionic @xmath1 s , and we have argued that the lightest stable states belonging to these representations correspond to the four _ neutral _ members of the @xmath247 bi - doublets contained in the two @xmath1 s .",
    "thus , a first requirement for viable dm candidates , namely electric charge neutrality , is satisfied .",
    "after @xmath161 breaking the four neutral states arrange into two dirac spinors describing two types of fermions that are degenerate in mass , and after @xmath4 breaking loop corrections involving the @xmath5 gauge bosons mix these states in such a way that : ( i ) the mass eigenstates get splitted by an amount @xmath248 ; ( ii ) both the @xmath6 neutral gauge bosons couple non - diagonally the lighter neutral fermion to the heavier one . requiring",
    "that @xmath248 is large enough to forbid neutral current inelastic scatterings of dm into the heavier fermions allows to evade all the limits from dd dm searches , in spite of the fact that dm is constituted by weakly interacting dirac fermions .",
    "we have shown that the quantitative requirement @xmath249 can be satisfied only if the scale of @xmath161 breaking is not too large , and we have derived an _ upper _",
    "limit on the rh gauge bosons mass @xmath250tev .",
    "this upper bound strengthen the possibility that the lhc might detect signatures of a low scale lr symmetry , and this is particularly exciting in view of the anomalies recently reported by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite which can all be explained with a rh gauge boson with mass @xmath251 .",
    "+ before concluding , we should also point out some issues that within our minimal scenario are left open , and that might deserve further studies . in section  [ neutrinos ]",
    "we have pointed out that , as in all @xmath0 derived low scale lr models , there is not enough suppression for the light neutrino masses from the seesaw mechanism , and to accommodate the neutrino mass scale we had to invoke some amount of tuning in the yukawa sector .",
    "a related issue is the fact that the scale of the rh neutrino masses is too low to allow for an explanation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry via the standard leptogenesis scenario  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this is because the rh neutrinos are too light to provide sufficiently large cp violating asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have verified that with the minimal particle content that we have assumed , gauge coupling unification does not occur ; however , we expect that it can be recovered by adding new particles in suitable incomplete @xmath0 representations ( see for example  @xcite for different ways to recover gauge coupling unification in low scale lr models ) .",
