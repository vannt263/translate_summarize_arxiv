    "our methodology is instructive in finding the distribution of the domination number of similar pcds in @xmath44 or higher dimensions .",
    "in addition to the mathematical tractability and applicability to testing spatial patterns and classification , this new family of pcds is more flexible as it allows choosing an optimal parameter for best performance in hypothesis testing or pattern classification .",

    "for example , the cccd of @xcite can be viewed as an example of pcds and is briefly discussed in the next section .",

    "we consider the closed ball , @xmath75 for @xmath76 in this article .",

    "this interval partitioning can be viewed as the delaunay tessellation of @xmath43 based on @xmath38 .",

    "this drawback has motivated us to define new types of proximity maps . @xcite",
