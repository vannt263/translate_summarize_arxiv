    "quantum information processing , quantum simulation , and quantum communication require the individual manipulation and the coupling of quantum bits ( qubits ) .",
    "early candidates for qubits were two - dimensional physical systems , like the polarization of a photon or the spin of an electron , in which the state of the system directly represents the state of the qubit .",
    "later , higher dimensional systems like atoms have been considered . there , a qubit is encoded in two energy levels while the remaining dimensions are ignored @xcite .",
    "infinite dimensional systems have been studied too .",
    "for instance , the encoding of a single qubit ( actually qudit , a version of a qubit ) in continuous variables and harmonic oscillators has been described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "importantly , a common feature of all these encodings is the use of a single degree of freedom to encode a _",
    "single _ qubit .",
    "an interesting alternative is to use a single degree of freedom to encode _ many _ qubits .",
    "let us consider an infinite dimensional system which can be decomposed into a qubit subsystem and a system isomorphic to the original system itself , a feature only possible for infinite dimensional systems .",
    "then the same decomposition can be repeated over and over again to obtain as many qubits as desired .",
    "this is the core idea of this article .",
    "we show how to encode @xmath0 qubits ( qudits ) in a rotor , that is , a single continuous and periodic degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath0 qubits can be individually manipulated and coupled .",
    "remarkably , the advantage of this approach is that a single unitary transformation acting on the rotor can simultaneously rotate and entangle many qubits .",
    "limitations will , however , inevitably appear with the physical implementation .",
    "furthermore , an encoding is practicable only if it can tolerate small errors affecting the physical system .",
    "therefore , we use the stabilizer formalism @xcite to construct qubits that are robust against small errors in angular position and momentum .",
    "we then investigate practical approximations of our scheme and finally suggest a few implementations .    in sec .",
    "[ rotor ] we briefly describe a quantum mechanical rotor and a qubit .",
    "we present in sec .",
    "[ encoding ] a simple encoding to embed many qubits in a single rotor .",
    "we also give the corresponding universal set of quantum gates . in sec .",
    "[ protection ] we provide a more general quantum error - correcting code to protect many qubits against small errors in angular position and momentum .",
    "it turns out that the protected qubits require an unlimited amount of energy .",
    "thus we consider realistic approximations of the unphysical encoded qubits in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in quantum mechanics the angular momentum @xmath1 for rotation around a fixed axis is a self - adjoint operator with a discrete and infinite spectrum .",
    "as we will see , this discreteness represents a very natural basis to encode qubits .",
    "we label the eigenstates of the operator @xmath1 with an integer @xmath2 as @xmath3 in this angular momentum basis @xmath4 , the orthogonality and completeness relations take the simple form @xmath5 we further define the fourier transform basis @xmath6 of @xmath4 as @xmath7 so that the two observables are complementary , that is , @xmath8 the angular position basis @xmath6 is continuous and , @xmath9 . accordingly , we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the delta function defined as @xmath12 and the integration is over any @xmath13 interval .",
    "let us now consider the operator @xmath14 , with real @xmath15 .",
    "its action on a ket @xmath16 reads @xmath17 the operator @xmath14 is therefore called the shift operator in angular position .",
    "it follows from the fact that @xmath18 is an integer that @xmath19 .",
    "we proceed to introduce @xmath20 , the shift operator in angular momentum .",
    "it is defined through its action on @xmath4 as @xmath21 note for completeness that @xmath22 it is not too difficult to verify that these two shift operators satisfy the commutation relation @xmath23 these two properties together with @xmath19 define the so - called weyl pair or schwinger operators of a rotor . the notion of a weyl pair",
    "is closely related to the heisenberg - weyl and generalized pauli groups @xcite .",
    "a quantum mechanical system is entirely characterized by its weyl pair .",
    "first , each weyl pair fully defines the hilbert space of the system .",
    "second , the weyl pair is algebraically complete , that is , any operator acting on the system can be expressed in terms of these two operators only .",
    "this makes the weyl pair extremely useful for discussing the properties of a quantum mechanical system @xcite .    as for the rotor we can introduce the weyl pair @xmath24 of a qubit",
    "the operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 are both unitary and hermitian and such that @xmath27 by construction , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are fourier transforms of each other and each one corresponds to the shift operator on the eigenbasis of the other .",
    "let us clarify here an important issue related to qubit encoding . for practical reasons , the involution property of the qubit weyl pair",
    "might be withdrawn leading to the definition of a pseudo qubit .",
    "for example , one could only require @xmath28 and @xmath29 to equal the projection operator onto the qubit subspace as seen in @xcite .",
    "in this article , we focus our attention on genuine qubits for which the hilbert space is the tensor product of the qubit space times the space for all other degrees of freedom .",
    "for the sake of clarity we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we show how to encode a single qubit on the basis of the angular momentum .",
    "this encoding can be schematically summarized as @xmath30 .",
    "our mapping corresponds to a splitting of the angular momentum space into two isomorphic subspaces .",
    "one subspace corresponds to even angular momenta while the second subspace is associated with odd angular momenta .",
    "such a decomposition is formally explained below but can be intuitively understood in terms of splitting the fourier series of a function into even and odd parts .",
    "the splitting effectively provides a qubit while each partial fourier series lead to a complete fourier series , that is , a new rotor .",
    "second , we use the same procedure and this remarkable tensor product structure to further split the remaining rotor . we can repeatedly factorize the remaining rotor degree of freedom and so create more and more qubit degrees of freedom",
    ". we shall now begin with a single qubit .",
    "we want to encode a qubit subsystem in a rotor .",
    "mathematically , we use the weyl pair @xmath31 of the rotor to define the weyl pair @xmath24 of a qubit . specifically , we choose the two unitary and hermitian operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite as @xmath32 they obey the relation of  ( [ weylpair ] ) and hence they form the weyl pair of a qubit . note , furthermore , that the trace of @xmath25 and the trace of @xmath26 vanish , as in the @xmath33-dimensional case .",
    "the action of the operator @xmath25 is simple to understand as illustrated in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "it only considers the parity of the eigenstate @xmath34 .",
    "the total hilbert space is split into two eigenspaces , one with eigenvalue @xmath35 corresponding to even angular momenta and one with eigenvalue @xmath36 for the odd angular momenta .",
    "since the operator @xmath25 is infinitely degenerate , at least another operator is necessary to obtain a complete set of commuting operators ( csco ) of the original rotor .",
    "since two adjacent angular momenta are already discriminated by @xmath25 , the second operator of the csco can view them as identical .",
    "this can be done with the operator @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the floor function , that is , the largest integer that does not exceed @xmath39 .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    ".a qubit and a residual rotor . in this simplest case",
    ", the encoding corresponds to the parity of the angular momentum eigenstate @xmath34 .",
    "the residual rotor is obtained by concatenating two adjacent angular momentum eigenstates . [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for an easier reading of this table , the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 are labeled by the powers @xmath42 and @xmath43 instead of the eigenvalues themselves .",
    "for instance the eigenvalues of @xmath41 for two qubits and @xmath44 are @xmath45 but we chose to label them as @xmath46 .",
    "one must not fail to note that @xmath47 constitutes the weyl pair of a rotor so that the last degree of freedom corresponds to a residual rotor .",
    "moreover @xmath48 commute with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with the other qubits weyl pairs as well as with @xmath41 , so that we can finally write @xmath51 as a result we can still encode more qubits from the residual rotor and the situation is similar to that of sec .",
    "[ encoding ] . in principle",
    "we could also look at the weyl pair associated with @xmath41 and name the corresponding degree of freedom however this is irrelevant to the present study .",
    "the encoding of eq .",
    "( [ firstencodingbis ] ) allows error correction in angular momentum up to @xmath52 .",
    "thus we can choose to define @xmath53 from the maximal number of correctable errors , that is , @xmath54 .",
    "an even @xmath53 is also conceivable however the resulting encoding would be less compact and will therefore require to access greater angular momenta .",
    "the simple encoding provided in sec .  [ encoding ] is just a special case where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and would correspond to the stabilizer element @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",

    "we drop the eigenvalues of the stabilizer to lighten the notation .",
    "let us illustrate what we have learned with three examples .",
    "first we can consider a single qubit with no protection against shift in the angular momentum , that is , @xmath60 , @xmath55 , @xmath61 .",
    "the computational basis is then given by @xmath62 equivalently , these states can be written in the angular position basis as : @xmath63 for a single qubit with protection against a unit shift in angular momentum ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , we obtain the two protected states @xmath66 a more interesting instance is concerned with two qubits .",
    "if we ask for protection against unit shifts in angular momentum ( @xmath64 and @xmath67 ) , we end up with @xmath68    as already mentioned earlier , these ideal code words are unphysical .",
    "this can be seen for example in eq .",
    "( [ protectedqubit1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ protectedqubit2 ] ) .",
    "these states take the form of an infinite sum of equally weighted angular momenta and are perfectly localized in angular position . in the following section we will investigate physical approximations of the ideal protected qubits .",
    "the code words , and in particular the protected qubits , are infinitely squeezed states in angular position . with implementation in mind",
    "we should investigate the behavior of realistic approximations of the protected qubits .",
    "these are the physical approximations .",
    "clearly , finite squeezing will inevitably lead to additional errors .",
    "sometimes these errors are within the range of correctable errors , sometimes they are not .",
    "we calculate the probability of noncorrectable errors for physical approximations of the protected qubits .",
    "we consider four physical approximations .",
    "two approximations pattern a finite squeezing in position .",
    "the first one relies on a truncated gaussian wave function @xcite while the second is a power of cosine wave function .",
    "the remaining two approximations are better envisioned in the angular momentum basis .",
    "one approximation resorts on a gaussian envelop for the infinite sum of angular momenta whereas the last instance focuses on a finite sum which we name grating .",

    "we want to define the probability of noncorrectable errors . for simplicity we first restrict ourselves to a single qubit only protected against drifts in angular position ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "but the generality of the arguments remains and the formulas derived below are immediately generalized to larger @xmath0 and @xmath71 . in view of eq .",
    "( [ protectedqubit2 ] ) , the errors are specified on the two basis states @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "however , we can not apply the above definition to more general mixtures ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 different from one half ) where the off - diagonal terms @xmath91 and @xmath92 do not vanish .",

    "[ approximation ] , have to be taken into account . any operation on the encoded qubits can then be realized with holograms , lenses , and linear optical elements and the measurements are carried out with well - established interferometric technologies .",

    "furthermore we have considered physical approximations of the ideal scheme and their consecutive error probabilities .",
    "we have then turned to implementations and proposed several directions .    theoretically , the advantage of encoding many qubits in a single degree of freedom is to allow their individual manipulation with a single unitary transformation .",

    "good care has been taken to encode genuine qubits subsystems in a rotor .",
    "a benefit is the freedom to use the remaining rotor to extract new qubits .",
    "another advantage , inherent to the tensor product structure , is the possibility to correct errors .",

    "nonetheless one might wonder whether genuine qubits and pseudo qubits exhibit a difference not only in terms of error model but also in operational terms .",
    "in other words , is there any task that can be performed with genuine qubits but that can not be preformed equally well , or not at all , with pseudo qubits ?",
    "the challenges finally lie in the implementation .",
    "the scalability of the proposed scheme is directly related to the accuracy the rotor can be manipulated with . therefore , with today s technology , it seems reasonable to reach a dozen of encoded qubits .",
    "this would already allow the simulation of small quantum systems .",
    "let us conclude with a few comments on the orbital angular momentum of light .",
    "unlike earlier proposals , the full continuous variable character of this degree of freedom is used , resulting in many genuine qubit subsystems .",

    "<S> we propose a scheme for encoding many qubits in a single rotor , that is , a continuous and periodic degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> a key feature of this scheme is its ability to manipulate and entangle the encoded qubits with a single operation on the system . </S>",
    "<S> we also show , using quantum error - correcting codes , how to protect the qubits against small errors in angular position and momentum which may affect the rotor . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss the feasibility of this scheme and suggest several candidates for its implementation . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme is immediately generalizable to qudits of any finite dimension . </S>"
