    "obscured carbon stars provide us with fascinating environments to study the spectacular mass loss stage in the evolution of a typical star . in the standard model , stellar pulsation coupled with circumstellar wind ejects mass from the stellar surface into the interstellar medium .",
    "the primary consequence of stellar mass loss is the formation of a circumstellar envelope and during this process the ejected material undergoes several stages of chemical and physical processing @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar material is made up of molecular gas and ` dusty ' grains that can provide surfaces for additional processing and grain growth .",
    "as the circumstellar shell expands , photochemical processes also become important in the breakdown and formation of further molecules @xcite .",
    "it is well established that the carbon to oxygen ( c / o ) ratio dictates the molecular species in circumstellar shells due to the high stability of the co molecule @xcite .",
    "this allows a broad variety of molecular species to form from the remaining oxygen - rich or carbon - rich material in circumstellar shells of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite .",
    "irc + 10216 ( crl 1381 ) is carbon - rich and is the best studied example of a circumstellar shell @xcite with more than 80 molecules detected so far , typically from pure rotational spectra @xcite .",
    "approximately 80% of these molecules are carbon containing species @xcite , although an interesting oxygen chemistry has also been shown to exist @xcite , thus making circumstellar shells a challenging environment for physical and chemical models @xcite .",
    "the smallest pure carbon chains ( c@xmath6 and c@xmath1 ) are ubiquitous throughout the interstellar medium @xcite and have been detected in diffuse interstellar clouds @xcite , comets @xcite and star forming cores @xcite .",
    "pure carbon chains do not possess a permanent dipole moment and therefore have no allowed pure rotational transitions .",
    "a thick ` dusty ' circumstellar shroud means there is little flux in the visible region and absorptions from electronic transitions can not be observed due to scattering .",
    "however , this makes circumstellar envelopes ideal for observing vibration - rotation bands or low - lying electronic transitions in the infrared .",
    "the c@xmath6 @xcite , c@xmath1 @xcite and c@xmath4 @xcite pure carbon chains have been detected in irc + 10216 .",
    "longer pure carbon chains have yet to be identified but their derivatives , such as hc@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , h@xmath6c@xmath7 ( @xmath9 ) and hc@xmath10n ( @xmath11 , ) are prominent species in circumstellar shells and interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "small carbon chains ( c@xmath7 ) are therefore believed to be the fundamental building blocks of larger carbon containing species , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , cyanopolyynes and fullerenes @xcite .",
    "indeed , the pure carbon molecules , c@xmath12 and c@xmath13 , have been observed in planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "small carbon chains are also important in flame chemistry @xcite and soot formation @xcite .",
    "understanding circumstellar chemistry relies heavily on the archetypical object irc + 10216 due to its proximity and large mass loss @xcite .",
    "spectral surveys have been preformed on circumstellar shells around other carbon stars , such cit 6 @xcite and crl 3068 @xcite , which both show a similar chemical composition to irc + 10216",
    ". however , as a carbon - rich agb star evolves , the chemical composition changes primarily due to photochemical processes @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar winds transport molecules and dust into the envelope where chemical pathways are thought to lead to the formation of carbon chains and aromatic rings @xcite .",
    "these molecules are then broken down as a part of the agb shell evolution towards planetary nebulae .",
    "determining the abundance of small chains in circumstellar shells allow chemical models to be refined , whilst comparing carbon chain abundances between carbon - rich circumstellar shells determines the appropriateness of irc + 10216 as the prototypical example .",
    "vibration - rotation transitions of pure carbon chains allow the detection of these molecules in circumstellar envelopes when high - resolution experimental data is available .",
    "the @xmath0 antisymmetric stretch of c@xmath1 has been the focus of a number of experimental and theoretical studies @xcite , and has a band center at 2040.019 @xmath2 ( vacuum wavelength 4.901915 @xmath3 m ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , has been measured in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the close proximity of these fundamental frequencies ( within 0.3 @xmath3 m ) allow all three molecules to be studied in circumstellar shells using the same high - resolution instrument .",
    "high - resolution infrared spectra were obtained of target carbon stars with known circumstellar shells using the 8.1 m gemini south telescope and the noao phoenix spectrometer @xcite .",

    "the latest models have reduced the column densities of c@xmath1 and c@xmath4 , however there is still a disagreement between observation and calculation .",
    "most notably , c@xmath1 is underestimated whereas c@xmath4 is overestimated .",
    "the calculated values from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , shown in figure  [ comparison ] , predict the column densities of c@xmath1 and c@xmath4 to be almost equal .",
    "our work suggests that c@xmath1 is almost 2 orders of magnitude greater than c@xmath4 ( see table  [ tab - columndensities ] ) , which indicates a similar trend to that seen in @xcite where the abundance of c@xmath1 was @xmath3210 times greater than c@xmath4 .",
    "the empirical column densities for small carbon chains ( particularly c@xmath6 , c@xmath1 and c@xmath4 ) indicate that the reaction rates for small carbon chains in current models are incorrect ; the models are missing important reactions ; or the choice of initial circumstellar conditions is not suitable .",
    "carbon containing molecules are ubiquitous throughout the interstellar medium and are not confined to circumstellar envelopes @xcite .",
    "linear carbon chain growth is thought to eventually lead to larger species like pahs , cyanopolyynes , fullerenes and even amino acids .",
    "benzene ( c@xmath106h@xmath106 ) has been detected in proto - planetary nebula @xcite , cyanopolyyne species containing a chain of as many as 11 carbon atoms ( hc@xmath107n ) have been observed in dark interstellar clouds @xcite and large fullerenes , such as c@xmath12 and c@xmath13 , have been observed in planetary nebula @xcite .",
    "@xcite consider a revised chemical model for dark interstellar clouds that includes a number of reactions that break down larger linear carbon chains into smaller chains via reaction pathways such as    c @xmath39 c@xmath7 @xmath98 c@xmath1 @xmath39 c@xmath108 ,    where @xmath109 .",
    "they note that the consequence for linear carbon chains is to limit the abundance of longer chains ( c@xmath110 ) due to faster reaction rates , resulting in an accumulation of c@xmath1 , which has an estimated low reactivity .",
    "this would have the consequence of increasing the c@xmath1 column density at the expense of c@xmath4 ( and longer chains ) , which would appear to improve current model calculations ( figure  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "the c@xmath1 column densities can be used to determine an average column density of @xmath111 @xmath37 for the circumstellar envelopes of carbon - rich agb stars .",
    "however , not all carbon stars have equivalent c / o ratios or mass loss rates , which are essential in understanding the circumstellar chemistry .",
    "the c / o ratio for irc + 10216 is given as 1.4 and the mass loss rate has been calculated as @xmath112@xmath113 year@xmath84 @xcite , but these parameters are unavailable for the remaining objects so no correlations can be investigated .",
    "since c@xmath1 was observed in all objects , we believe irc + 10216 remains a prototypical example .    @xcite identified a correlation between c@xmath6 column densities and circumstellar expansion velocity .",
    "our results show no correlation between c@xmath1 or c@xmath4 column densities with the shell velocity ; however if the more recent stellar velocity of -26.0 km s@xmath84 @xcite is used for irc + 10216 , a slight increase in column density is seen for decreasing shell velocity .",
    "our velocities are consistent and indicate a typical circumstellar shell velocity to be approximately 17.5 km s@xmath84 .",
    "the small carbon chain c@xmath1 has been detected in the circumstellar envelopes of crl 865 , irc + 10216 , crl 1922 and crl 2023 by the identification of a number of vibration - rotation lines from the @xmath0 antisymmetric stretch of c@xmath1 near 2040 @xmath2 .",
    "the calculated column densities are @xmath38 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath43 @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we used synthetic spectra to remove telluric features from our observations , highlighting how a line - by - line radiative transfer model can be used to remove telluric features if reference star spectra are of poor quality or unavailable .",
    "c@xmath4 was observed in irc + 10216 with a column density of @xmath77 @xmath37 , and upper limits have been provided for 5 for other sources .",
    "an upper limit for the column density of c@xmath5 in irc + 10216 was estimated to be @xmath87 @xmath37 .",
    "our measurements suggest a revision to circumstellar shell models may be needed to account for small carbon chain abundances .",
