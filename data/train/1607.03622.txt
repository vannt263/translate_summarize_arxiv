    "spectral bands due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emissions are dominant features in the near- and mid - infrared ( ir ) .",
    "since pahs are excited by far - uv photons ( 613.6  ev ) , the pah features are characteristic emissions of photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "the pah emission features are observed at wavelengths of 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 12.0 , 12.7 , 13.5 , 14.2 , and 17  @xmath4 , which are attributed to vibrations of c - h or c - c bonds in hydrocarbons .",
    "those features , especially main features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and 12.7  @xmath4 , are theoretically and observationally studied well ( e.g. , @xcite ) . through the difference in the origins of the emission features",
    ", past studies showed that the pah interband ratios are useful probes to investigate the properties of pahs . among them",
    ", ionization degrees may be most intensively discussed ones based on the pah 6.2  @xmath4/pah 11.3  @xmath4 or pah 7.7  @xmath4/pah 11.3  @xmath4 ratio ; the pah 6.2  @xmath4 and 7.7  @xmath4 features due to c - c bonds are efficiently emitted by ionized pahs , while the pah 11.3  @xmath4 feature due to c - h bonds is efficiently emitted by both ionized and neutral pahs ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is expected that the ionization degrees of pahs are relatively high near exciting sources while those are low in molecular clouds , which also depend on the electron density .",
    "another important property is the internal structure of pahs , which is probed by using the interband ratios of the pah features at 11.3 , 12.0 , 12.7 , 13.5 , and 14.2  @xmath4 ; likely origins of these features are all c - h in - plane bending , but the numbers of adjacent c - h bonds in a benzene ring are different ( pah  11.3  @xmath4 : mono ; pah  12.0  @xmath4 : duo ; pah  12.7  @xmath4 : triple ; pah  13.5  @xmath4 and pah  14.2  @xmath4 : quartet ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , edgy pahs are expected to show the strong pah  12.0 , 12.7 , 13.5 , and 14.2  @xmath4 features relative to the pah  11.3  @xmath4 feature .",
    "the structures of pahs may change from region to region depending on the surrounding radiation field . therefore examining the pah ionization together with the internal pah structure",
    "may be helpful to discuss variations of the pah properties .",
    "recently , variations in the pah properties have been intensively studied for a variety of targets mainly with @xmath0 and @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of such studies , however , discussed pahs in individual areas , and did not intensively examine spatial variations of pahs .",
    "in order to examine the effects of the surrounding interstellar environment on the pah properties , spatially - resolved observations are essential .",
    "one of the most intensive spatially - resolved studies in pahs was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed @xmath0/irs spectral maps of the reflection nebula ngc  7023 and decomposed the observed spectra to the emission features from ionized and neutral pahs .",
    "as a result , they found clear spatial variations in the pah ionization degree along the direction from the exciting b - type star to pdr and molecular - cloud regions .",
    "@xcite also examined the pah interband ratios of seven galactic hii regions and three reflection nebulae with @xmath0/irs spectral maps , although they did not discuss spatial variations of the ratios in target regions .",
    "@xcite examined the ionization degrees of pahs in the orion nebula based on their ground - based near - ir narrow - band observations .",
    "the number of such spatially - resolved studies of pahs is , however , still limited .    in this paper",
    ", we present @xmath0/irs spectral maps of the mid - ir pah features in the galactic star - forming region m17 as well as br@xmath1 and @xmath2co(@xmath3=10 ) maps covering the spectral maps .",
    "m17 is young ( @xmath61  myr ; @xcite ) and one of the most active galactic star - forming regions , which contains more than 100 ob stars in the central cluster , ngc  6618 ( @xcite ) . among them ,",
    "the most active ionizing source is cen1 , a binary of o4+o4 stars ( @xcite ) . assuming the distance of 2  kpc ( @xcite ) , the area of the spectral maps in the present study is @xmath7  pc@xmath8 which is 80 times larger than that in the previous study for ngc  7023 ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on the wide - area spectral maps , we examine the effects of the intense star - forming activity on the properties of pahs in detail .",
    "we analyzed archival @xmath0/irs spectral mapping data ( aorkey : 17976320 , 17976576 , 17977344 , and 17977600 ) , which were retrieved from the @xmath0 heritage archives . the observed area is shown in fig .  [ jiang_area ] .",
    "the observing mode is short - wavelength - low - resolution ( sl ) covering a wavelength range of 5.214.5  @xmath4 with a spectral resolution of @xmath9=64128 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used cube builder for irs spectra maps ver .",
    "1.8 ( cubism ; @xcite ) to reduce the data , and obtained three fits cubes for the sl1 ( 7.414.5  @xmath4 ) , sl2 ( 5.27.7  @xmath4 ) , and sl3 ( 7.38.6  @xmath4 ) modules , separately . in the data reduction ,",
    "background spectra were not considered .",
    "the major background in the mid - ir is the zodiacal light , the spectra of which have smooth continua without prominent spectral features ( @xcite ) .",
    "the intensity of the zodiacal light is @xmath660  mjy / str at a wavelength of 18  @xmath4 around m17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of the zodiacal light in m17 spectra is negligible near the center , while that is not in outer regions .",
    "we , therefore , do not discuss the continuum emission in the present study .",
    "after unifying the pixel scale from the original size to 3.@xmath106 for the three fits cubes to correct differences in the spatial resolution at each wavelength range , the intensity levels for sl1 and sl2 were adjusted to coincide with sl3 in the overlapped wavelength ranges .",
    "finally , we obtained 990 independent mid - ir spectra .",
    "we performed narrow - band imaging of m17 with the sirius camera on the irsf 1.4  m telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "sirius has a field of view of 7.@xmath117 @xmath12 7.@xmath117 with a pixel scale of 0.@xmath1045 .",
    "we observed m17 using the two narrow - band filters tuned for the pa@xmath13 1.28  @xmath4 and br@xmath1 2.16  @xmath4 lines , simultaneously .",
    "the effective band widths of the filters are 0.029  @xmath4 for pa@xmath13 and 0.038  @xmath4 for br@xmath1 .",
    "the observation was carried out on 2013 june 10 with an integration time of 75 seconds and 20 dithering . the observed area is also shown in fig .  [ jiang_area ] .",
    "in the present study , we analyzed only the br@xmath1 image which is less affected by the interstellar extinction than the pa@xmath13 image .",
    "we reduced the image data based on the standard data reduction procedure including dark subtraction , flat - fielding , sky subtraction and dithered - image - combining .",
    "since we did not subtract a continuum image , free - free continuum emission may be contaminated in the br@xmath1 image .",
    "photometric calibration was performed by comparing point - source fluxes in the image with those in the 2mass point source catalog ( @xcite ) , where we assumed that the magnitude of each point source is the same between the @xmath14-band and the narrow - band images .",
    "we used sufficiently isolated 11 point sources with the @xmath14-band flux in a range of 9.011.0  mag and the flux errors smaller than 0.05 mag . as a result ,",
    "the uncertainty of the photometric calibration coefficient is @xmath65  % .",
    "the final 1@xmath15 noise level is @xmath16 .",
    "we analyzed co mapping data of m17 , which were taken in the framework of the fugin ( forest ultra - wide galactic plane survey in nobeyama ; umemoto et al . in prep ) legacy survey covering the wide area of the galactic plane ( @xmath17=1050@xmath18 , 198236@xmath18 , @xmath19 ) with a high spatial resolution of 15@xmath10 and 1@xmath15 noise level of 0.4  k in the @xmath20 scale at 1 km / s velocity resolution .",

    "pointing errors were corrected every 1.5 hours by observing sio maser sources . as a result ,",
    "the pointing accuracy of the telescope is kept to be @xmath23 .",

    "the @xmath2co map has spatial resolution of 18@xmath10 and 1@xmath15 noise level of @xmath60.8  k in the @xmath20 scale at 1  km / s velocity resolution as an intermediate product of the survey project .",
    "the detail of the survey observations and data reductions will be described in umemoto et al . in prep .",
    "figure  [ pahfit_result_matome ] shows examples of the spectra extracted from positions i , ii , and iii which are labeled in fig .  [ jiang_area ] .",
    "the spectra show a variety of emission features due to pahs at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 12.0 , 12.7 , 13.5 , and 14.2  @xmath4 , and fine - structure lines ( [ neii ] , [ ariii ] , and [ siv ] ) .",
    "the fine - structure lines are dominant in position i which is nearest to the m17 center , while the pah features are dominant in positions ii and iii . in order to examine variations of the pah intensities and interband ratios , we decomposed the spectra using the pahfit tool ( @xcite ) , which is designed to fit various spectral features in @xmath0/irs sl spectra including silicate dust absorption around 9.7  @xmath4 .",
    "we used pahfit assuming the screen dust extinction , and reconstructed the spectral maps of the mid - ir features . in the mid - ir spectra ,",
    "the pah  7.7  @xmath4 , 11.3  @xmath4 , and 12.7  @xmath4 features are treated as pah complexes which have multiple components . as treated in @xcite , we calculated a sum of the three components centered at 7.42  @xmath4 , 7.60  @xmath4 , and 7.85  @xmath4 for the intensity of the pah  7.7  @xmath4 complex , the two components centered at 11.23  @xmath4 and 11.33  @xmath4 for the intensity of the pah  11.3  @xmath4 complex , and the two components centered at 12.62  @xmath4 and 12.69  @xmath4 for the intensity of the pah  12.7  @xmath4 complex . in the fitting procedure , we considered the systematic error of 2  % ( @xcite ) in addition to random errors . figure  [ pahfit_result_matome ] also shows the results of pahfit calculations , where pahfit reproduces the example spectra fairly well .",
    "figure  [ specmap ] shows the resultant spectral maps obtained for the mid - ir features ( pah features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 12.0 , 12.7 , 13.5 , and 14.2  @xmath4 , [ neii ] , [ ariii ] , [ siv ] , and optical depth of silicate dust absorption at 9.7  @xmath4 ) , where the interstellar extinction is corrected . in the maps",
    ", there is a large - scale gradient from the north - east to the south - west . in the pah maps ,",
    "there are also local structures especially on the east side , suggesting that pahs are not only globally but also locally affected by the surrounding interstellar environments .",
    "it is notable that the maps of the pah 12.7  @xmath4 and 12.0  @xmath4 features are similar to each other .",
    "they are both probably attributed to c - h out - of - plane bending modes , and the former is blended with the strong [ neii ] line , while the latter is not .",
    "therefore , this similarity suggests that pahfit has successfully decomposed emissions from the pah 12.7  @xmath4 feature and the [ neii ] line . in the fine - structure line maps ,",
    "a spatial extent in the [ neii ] map is large , while that in [ siv ] is small , which presumably corresponds to the difference in the ionization potential ; the energies required to ionize ne@xmath24 , ar@xmath25 , and s@xmath26 are 21.6  ev , 27.6  ev , and 34.8  ev , respectively . in the optical depth map , there is a ridge structure in the north - south direction .",

    ", we estimate the ionization degree from the pah 7.7  @xmath4/pah 11.3  @xmath4 ratio using the following equation in @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 indicate the intensities of the pah 7.7  @xmath4 and pah 11.3  @xmath4 features , and the number density of pahs , respectively .",

    "therefore , the ionization degree of pahs varies in a wide range from region to region , and typical pahs are moderately ionized in m17sw .",
    "such a situation is similar to the cases of the previous studies ; the ionization degree of pahs is 1070  % and typically 50  % in ngc  7023 ( @xcite ) , while that is 20100  % and typically 50  % in orion bar ( @xcite ) .",

    "the maximum ionization degree of 80% in m17sw is lower than that of orion bar and comparable to that in ngc  7023 .",
    "this difference is presumably due to the difference in the observed positions ; the exciting stars are covered in the observational area of orion bar , while those are not covered in those of m17 and ngc  7023 .",

    "[ ionization_degree ] is that the pah ionization degree is high near the peak of the @xmath2co emission .",
    "as expressed in the definition of the ionization parameter , the balance between the ionization and recombination is important in the pah ionization degree .",

    "[ ionization_parameter ] , we find that the @xmath40 map exhibits a local maximum near the peak of the pah ionization degree , whereas the [ cii ] map in @xcite does not have a local minimum there .",
    "these results support the high pah ionization degree inside the molecular cloud , which may be caused by high @xmath40 rather than low @xmath42 .",
    "although m17sw is one of the most intensively studied regions in our galaxy , the spatial structure in a line of sight is still unclear ; @xcite and @xcite proposed clumpy and bowl - shaped structures in m17sw , respectively .",

    "[ specmap](k ) . hence pahs with irregular structures are likely to be abundant due to the uv radiation near the m17 center .    the plots in figs .",
    "[ othermap2](e)-[othermap2](h ) show overall good correlations between the interband ratios . comparing them in detail , however , we find that there are small differences in the relation ; the pah 12.0  @xmath4/pah 11.3  @xmath4 and pah 13.5  @xmath4/pah 11.3  @xmath4 ratios increase nearly in proportion to the pah 12.7  @xmath4/pah 11.3  @xmath4 and pah 14.2  @xmath4/pah 11.3  @xmath4 ratios , respectively ( figs .",

    "hence , the pah 12.0  @xmath4 and 12.7  @xmath4 intensities start to increase first and then increases in the pah 13.5  @xmath4 and 14.2  @xmath4 intensities follow , relative to the pah 11.3  @xmath4 intensity . the relative delay in the growth of the pah 13.5",
    "@xmath4 and 14.2  @xmath4 intensities suggests that structural changes of pahs may gradually take place with increasing uv intensity ( and/or hardness ) .",
    "the proportionality of the pah 13.5  @xmath4 intensity to the pah 14.2  @xmath4 intensity ( fig .",
    "[ othermap2](h ) ) supports that they are of the same origin , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "based on @xmath0/irs spectral mapping observations , we have examined spatial variations of the pah properties around the m17sw region .",
    "we analyzed independent 990 spectra , which show prominent pah features at wavelengths of 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 12.0 , 12.7 , 13.5 , and 14.2  @xmath4 as well as fine - structure lines .",
    "we decomposed all the spectral features using the pahfit tool . as a result ,",
    "the derived pah emissions are bright in regions between hii regions traced by br@xmath1 and molecular cloud regions traced by @xmath2co .",
    "additionally , the pah intensity maps show a large - scale gradient from the north - east to south - west , indicating that pahs are irradiated by uv from the ob stars in the m17 center . by contrast",
    ", pah interband ratio maps show no clear large - scale gradient but they are locally changed .",
    "these results suggest that the pah ionization is mainly controlled by local conditions rather than the large - scale uv environment determined by the ob stars in the m17 center . the pah ionization degree estimated from the pah 7.7  @xmath4/pah 11.3  @xmath4 ratios ranges from 15 to 80  % with its typical value of @xmath645  % , which is comparable to that in the previous studies for ngc  7023 and orion bar .",
    "we also find that the pah ionization degree is high inside the molecular cloud .",
    "we discuss the ionization balance using the @xmath40 and [ cii ] maps to find that @xmath40/[cii ] ratios show a local maximum inside the molecular cloud .",
    "we conclude that buried b - type or later stars may be important to determine the ionization degrees of pahs in local conditions .",
    "additionally , the pah internal structures are examined by ratios of the pah  12.0 , 12.7 , 13.5 , and 14.2  @xmath4 features to the pah  11.3  @xmath4 feature , which suggests that the pah structure is changed especially near the m17 center .",
    "it is possible that edgy irregular pahs may be dominant near the m17 center due to the hard uv radiation .",
