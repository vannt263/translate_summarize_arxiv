    "luminous extragalactic radio sources are associated with either quasars or radio galaxies , the latter class of object lacking the bright non - stellar continuum and prominent broad emission lines that characterize the former . for many years",
    "astronomers have speculated that at least some radio galaxies harbour an active nucleus which , although obscured from view along the line of sight , would be observed as a quasar if seen from certain other , favourable directions ( e.g. , scheuer 1987 ) .",
    "there is now overwhelming observational evidence that this is the case .",
    "most notably , spectropolarimetry has revealed the presence of quasar - like broad emission lines in the polarized flux spectra of a number of radio galaxies ( e.g. , tran et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) . in such cases",
    "the broad lines are hidden from direct view but are scattered into our line of sight by a screen of either dust or electrons . however , the more general proposition that _ all _ radio galaxies harbour obscured quasar nuclei has not yet been confirmed .",
    "it is generally believed that the unobscured lines of sight lie close to the axis of the twin radio jets , and that quasars are therefore seen more nearly ` pole - on ' than their radio galaxy counterparts ( e.g. , barthel 1989 ) .",
    "this is supported by the presence of bright radio cores and one - sided jets in quasars that are weak or absent in radio galaxies ( e.g. , owen & puschell 1984 ) , a result which is most naturally explained by doppler boosting of emission from relativistic jets moving close to the line of sight .",
    "even more compelling evidence comes from optical polarization studies that have revealed many radio galaxies in which the rest - frame ultraviolet light is strongly polarized with its electric vector lying perpendicular to the radio axis ( e.g. , tadhunter et al .",
    "these observations suggest that quasar light can emerge relatively unhindered along the radio axis , and reach the observer after scattering , whilst direct transmitted radiation from the quasar nucleus is effectively blocked .",
    "such processes are also at least partly responsible for the so - called ` alignment effect ' ( chambers , miley & van breugel 1987 ; mccarthy et al .  1987 )",
    " the tendency for the elongation of optical and radio structures along a common axis .    in an orientation - based unification scheme such as this",
    ", the obscuring material lies preferentially in the plane perpendicular to the radio jets , and a central parameter is the angle between the radio axis and the line of sight which grazes the edge of the obscuring material ( generally referred to as the ` torus ' ) .",
    "a simple model which is often considered relates this critical angle @xmath13 to the inner radius of the torus , @xmath14 , and its half - height , @xmath15 , via @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , simpson 1998 ) . in this model",
    "there are physical reasons why @xmath14 , and hence @xmath13 , might be expected to correlate with quasar luminosity : if the value of @xmath14 is determined by the radius at which dust sublimates in the radiation field of the quasar then it should increase with the photoionizing luminosity of the quasar as @xmath17 ( lawrence 1991 ) .",
    "this picture where the torus opens up as the luminosity of the quasar increases in known as the ` receding torus ' model .",
    "strong links between the intrinsic uv / optical luminosity of the quasar nuclei of radio sources and extended radio luminosity are now firmly established ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ; falcke , malkan & biermann 1995 ; serjeant et al .",
    "1998 ; willott et al .",
    "1998c ) in the sense that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the 178-mhz ( extended ) radio luminosity .",
    "it therefore seems highly plausible that @xmath14 and hence @xmath13 will rise , albeit slowly , with radio luminosity ( @xmath20 ) ,    the brightest ( 3c ) radio sources at @xmath0 are about 100 times more radio luminous than 3c sources at @xmath21 , so assuming @xmath15 to be independent of @xmath19 and @xmath12 , we expect @xmath14 and hence @xmath22 to be a factor @xmath23 greater for these objects .",
    "the quasar fraction should therefore be correspondingly larger , and , since lines of sight grazing the torus will subtend a much lower solid angle , the fraction of lightly - reddened quasars should be much reduced ( see hill et al .",
    "1996 ) . based on their detection of a high fraction of lightly - reddened quasar nuclei from near - infrared spectroscopy of pa@xmath24 in low - redshift ( @xmath25 ) 3c radio sources , hill , goodrich & depoy ( 1996 ) found @xmath26 , and used the receding torus model to make quantitative predictions about the distribution of nuclear extinctions in higher - redshift , more radio luminous , sources .",
    "their predictions were in rough agreement with economou et al.s ( 1995 ) discovery of only one broad h@xmath24 line in a preliminary analysis of a sample of ten radio galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "however , as rawlings et al .",
    "( 1995 ) discuss , spectroscopic methods of detecting hidden quasar nuclei lack the sensitivity to provide a good general method of characterizing the angular distribution of reddening towards quasar nuclei in radio galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "this is because of the large optical depth expected towards rest - frame optical lines like h@xmath24 , and the poor sensitivity to weak rest - frame near - infrared lines like pa@xmath24 , particularly once they become redshifted beyond the @xmath8-band ( at @xmath27 in the case of pa@xmath24 ) .",
    "a definitive test of the receding torus model for high - redshift objects has therefore yet to be performed .",
    "the distribution of reddenings to the quasar nuclei may also have important cosmological implications , since the near - infrared hubble diagram for radio galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kz ] )  and the common assumption that the near - infrared emission of radio galaxies is dominated by starlight  has been used to infer constraints on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , lilly 1989 ; eales et al .",
    "the discovery that the @xmath8-band magnitudes of 6c radio galaxies , i.e. , those selected at a @xmath28 times lower radio flux limit than 3c , are @xmath29 magnitudes fainter than those of 3c radio galaxies at the same redshift ( eales et al .",
    "1997 ) suggests that there is some close link between radio luminosity and near - infrared luminosity . either , stellar luminosity  and by inference stellar mass",
    " correlates with radio luminosity , or there is some important component of the near - infrared luminosity which can be ascribed to a hidden quasar nucleus .",
    "recent discussions of these possibilities can be found in eales et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , best , longair & rttgering ( 1998 ) and roche , eales & rawlings ( 1998 ) .",
    "although there is direct observational evidence from near - infrared polarimetry ( leyshon & eales 1998 ) that scattered light makes only a small ( few per cent ) contribution to the near - infrared luminosity of radio galaxies even when it makes a very significant contribution in the ultraviolet and optical , it has not yet been conclusively shown that reddened quasar light is also a negligible component . as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : kz ] , such quasar nuclei would need to be subject to only a fairly limited amount of reddening ( @xmath307 ) in order not to possess obvious quasar features in their optical spectra whilst still contributing to the @xmath8-band luminosity at the level of radio galaxies lying close to the mean @xmath8@xmath12 relation for radio galaxies .",
    "the existence of a substantial population of moderately - reddened quasars has been suggested by webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , although both the reality and importance of this population have been questioned ( serjeant & rawlings 1996 ; benn et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "in this paper we report on the results from a project designed with two principal aims .",
    "the first aim was to determine the contribution of transmitted quasar light to the @xmath8@xmath12 relation for @xmath0 radio galaxies , and hence determined whether reddened quasar nuclei can explain the difference in near - infrared luminosities between 3c and 6c radio galaxies .",
    "the second aim was to constrain the range of @xmath31 towards the quasar nuclei of luminous radio sources at @xmath0 , and to compare this range with the predictions of the receding torus model .",
    "the project was based around thermal - infrared imaging since , as discussed by rawlings et al .",
    "( 1995 ) this is for these purposes a much more powerful technique than spectroscopy .",
    "its utility rests on the dramatic divergence of the rest - frame spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of starlight and quasar light redward of 1@xmath32 m ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "although there is considerable variation in the quantitative spectral energy distributions of quasars , the inflexion at 1@xmath32 m appears to be a universal feature ( neugebauer et al .",
    "1987 ; sanders et al .  1989 ;",
    "elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , except for blazar - type sources where synchrotron emission dominates even at optical  infrared wavelengths .",
    "the rise to longer wavelengths is believed to be due to dust at or near its sublimation temperature ( @xmath33k ) .",
    "kobayashi et al .  (",
    "1993 ) have successfully modelled the near - infrared continua of low - redshift quasars in this manner , and barvainis ( 1987 ) has shown that the entire infrared spectrum from 1100@xmath32 m can be attributed to dust at a range of temperatures , with the hottest dust contributing most strongly at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "if the dust is heated by , and in thermal equilibrium with , the radiation field of the quasar , then the hottest dust must originate close to the central engine .",
    "thus even though emission from the hot dust may be optically thin and hence isotropic , it could easily be occluded by the larger - scale obscuring material so that the emergent flux becomes a strong function of viewing angle .",
    "the attenuation suffered at angles greater than @xmath13 should , however , be much less severe than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the apparent constancy of the near - infrared continuum slope in quasars ( neugebauer et al .",
    "1987 ) , and the possibility that the emitting regions are optically thin makes it an ideal region of the spectrum from which to determine the reddening .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe our selection of targets for thermal - infrared imaging . in section  3",
    "we describe our new imaging observations with the 3.9-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . in section  4",
    "we present the results of these observations and our analysis of the data . in section  5",
    "we widen our analysis to include archival data from the hubble space telescope ( ) , as well as a new near - infrared spectrum obtained at ukirt . in section  6",
    "we discuss the implications of our results , including both a discussion of the effects of hidden quasar nuclei on the @xmath8@xmath12 relation and a test of the receding torus model . in section  7",
    "we review the prospects for future observations of the type discussed in this paper .    throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed @xmath34kms@xmath35mpc@xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the convention for spectral index , @xmath24 , is that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the flux density at frequency @xmath40 . we have adopted a canonical rest - frame spectrum for a quasar of the following form : the composite quasar spectrum from francis et al.(1991 ) for wavelengths from 0.10.6@xmath32 m , a power law with @xmath41 from 0.61@xmath32 m , and a power law with @xmath42 from 13@xmath32 m .",
    "the motivation for the broken power - law form at near - ir wavelengths is provided by the data of neugebauer et al .",
    "we adopt the empirical extinction curve for the milky way given by pei ( 1992 ) as our assumed dust extinction curve .",
    "our primary goal in this project was to study a complete subsample of radio galaxies from the 3crr sample  which we hereafter refer to as the lrl sample ( after laing , riley & longair 1983 ) in order to more easily differentiate it from the 3cr sample  in the redshift range @xmath43 .",
    "these objects have 178-mhz radio luminosities @xmath44whz@xmath35sr@xmath35 , and they lie at redshifts where 3.8@xmath32 m imaging probes rest - frame wavelengths in the region of primary interest ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : seds ] ) .",
    "however , a combination of scheduling , technical problems , and poor weather meant that we were often either unable to observe all the sources within a given patch of sky , or conversely were short of targets . in the former case , we chose the targets to observe based solely on position in the sky so as to make our observing programme as efficient as possible , while in the latter case , we supplemented our list from the 3cr catalogue of bennett ( 1962a , b ) , on which lrl is based .",
    "the declination limit of ukirt forced us to exclude targets with @xmath45 .",
    "over the course of the three observing runs assigned to this project , plus some additional spare time on three other nights , we were able to observe all twelve radio galaxies from 3cr and lrl satisfying @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "our coverage in the ra range @xmath48 is less complete .",
    "we observed a randomly - selected subsample of five 3c radio galaxies from the eight with @xmath49 ; the excluded sources were 3c  237 ( in 3cr only ) and 3c  263.1 and 3c  280 ( also in lrl ) .",
    "we provide relevant data for our 3cr ( but non - lrl ) targets in table  [ tab : nonlrl ] ; a useful recent reference for data on the lrl sample is blundell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . a full list of our targets is included in table  [ tab : log ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath506584 only .",
    "while economou et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have also used cgs4 to detect broad wings on the h@xmath24 line in 3c  41 , their spectrum of 3c  265 does not reveal a broad line .",
    "this non - detection is in agreement with the much larger extinction we derive to the quasar in this object .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : lz ] we plot the @xmath1 magnitudes and limits of our ukirt targets against redshift , and compare these data with reddened quasar spectra .",
    "we also plot the estimated @xmath1 magnitudes of the lrl quasars in the same redshift range , extrapolated from optical ( usually @xmath51-band ) magnitudes , assuming zero reddening .",
    "because the differential reddening between ( observed - frame ) @xmath51 and @xmath1 is large ( approximately 2mag for @xmath52 ) , even modest amounts of extinction will move the quasars up the diagram significantly . indeed , the two apparently faint quasars at high redshift are 3c  212 and 3c  190 , which are both intrinsically red ( smith & spinrad 1980 ) and will therefore be much brighter at @xmath1 than we have estimated .    bearing this in mind ,",
    "it is clear that our @xmath1 limits are much fainter than the loci of unreddened quasars with luminosities typical of powerful radio sources at these redshifts .",
    "we have also been able to detect the weakest quasars associated with such objects , like 3c  65 , although at poorer limiting values of @xmath53 . however , the distribution of narrow emission line luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ) suggests that there are very few , if any , other objects as weak as 3c  65 in the lrl sample at these redshifts .",
    "assuming then that the quasars within the many radio galaxies for which we only have limits at @xmath1 have luminosities typical of those within other powerful radio sources , fig .",
    "[ fig : lz ] makes it clear that the extinction must be large in those sources we failed to detect at @xmath1 .",
    "our data can be used to quantify the size of the dust - reddened quasar population . since",
    "all our sources are steep - spectrum objects , red objects in our sample are unlikely to be due to beamed synchrotron radiation , as has been suggested for the red flat - spectrum quasar population ( serjeant & rawlings 1996 ; benn et al .",
    "1998 ) . among the 18 sources classified as quasars in fig .",
    "[ fig : lz ] , there are two ( 3c  190 and 3c  212 ; smith & spinrad 1980 ) that fall into this category . scaling this to our complete sample of 12.5 ` virtual ' quasars , and adding in 3c  22 , 3c  41 , and 3c  65 , we find that @xmath6% of quasars are dust - reddened ( 90% confidence limits ) .",
    "our first goal for this project was to investigate whether the presence of reddened quasar light accounts for a significant fraction of the total @xmath8-band flux in 3c radio galaxies .",
    "this could provide an explanation for the brighter @xmath8 magnitudes displayed by 3c radio galaxies compared to those from the fainter 6c and b2 samples ( eales et al .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a similar analysis to that of eales et al . , which involves fitting the least - squares regression line to the 3c @xmath8-band data , and then examining the residuals about this line for both the 3c and 6c samples ( we do not supplement the fainter sample with galaxies from the b2 survey ) .",
    "we use the same 63.9kpc metric aperture as eales et al .  and use the same prescription for correcting measurements made in apertures of other sizes .",
    "we first confirm the representative nature of our sample by fitting a regression line to the @xmath8-band magnitudes of our 18 galaxies .",
    "all 13 galaxies from the 6c survey in the same redshift range ( @xmath54 ) lie above this line ( i.e. , they are fainter ) , with the mean difference being 0.72mag .",
    "this is in good agreement with the 0.59mag discrepancy found by eales et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and we can use a kolmogorov - smirnov test to rule out the hypothesis that both samples are drawn from the same distribution at better than 95% confidence .",
    "we then correct the photometry for the presence of reddened nuclear light , using the fractional contamination determined in section  [ sec : hst ] and repeat the process .",
    "this time the 6c galaxies are on average only 0.56mag ( 40 per cent ) fainter , although the samples are still different at greater than 90% confidence .",
    "our confidence levels are lower than those of eales et al .",
    "( 1997 ) solely because our samples each contain only half the number of objects as theirs .",
    "coupled with the conclusion of leyshon & eales ( 1998 ) that scattered light is not a major contributor to the total @xmath8-band flux of most 3c radio galaxies , our analysis is able to rule out quasar light as the cause of the correlation between radio luminosity and near - infrared magnitude at @xmath0 .",
    "emission lines can also be ruled out since they would need to have a total flux of @xmath55wm@xmath56 to provide one - third of the total @xmath8-band light  this is several times greater than the flux of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath574959,5007 doublet yet the strongest lines which fall into the @xmath8-band over our redshift range are intrinsically much fainter ( see also rawlings et al",
    ".  1998a ) .",
    "finally , the nebular emission which has been suggested provides a significant fraction of the optical light and might explain the alignment effect ( dickson et al .",
    "1995 ) is a negligible contributor at near - infrared wavelengths . assuming [ o  ii]/h@xmath58 ( mccarthy 1993 )",
    ", it can contribute no more than about one per cent of the total @xmath8-band flux .",
    "the ` extra ' component in 3c radio galaxies , compared to 6c radio galaxies , is therefore not directly related to the more luminous central quasar , and must be additional stellar luminosity , and presumably stellar mass , in the host galaxy .",
    "this fits together with the smaller linear sizes of 6c radio galaxy hosts measured by roche et al .",
    "plausible reasons why a correlation between host galaxy mass and radio luminosity is seen at @xmath0 , but not at lower redshifts , are given by best et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the r.m.s .",
    "deviation of the 3c galaxies about the regression line is reduced from 0.59 to 0.43magnitudes when the correction for non - stellar contamination is made .",
    "this reduced scatter is the same as that observed around eales et al.s ( 1997 ) least - squares regression line for @xmath59 .      in order to be able to compare the receding torus model to our observational data",
    ", we have to associate lower limits to the nuclear extinction with the radio galaxies which we failed to detect at @xmath1 . estimating these extinctions is a very uncertain affair , since we do not know their intrinsic luminosities .",
    "table  [ tab : intrinsic ] indicates that a ` typical ' source might have @xmath60 ( @xmath61 for our canonical spectrum at all redshifts @xmath62 ) , yet the quasar within 3c  65 appears to be nearly ten times fainter , and the @xmath63 quasar 3c  175 is a magnitude brighter ( simpson , unpublished ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath64 so that the undetected sources must have @xmath65 , or @xmath7 ( at @xmath66 ; at lower redshifts , the rest - frame visual extinction will be higher for the same observed - frame @xmath67 ) and use this limit for all 15 of our non - detections .",
    "[ fig : lz ] clearly shows the conservative nature of this assumption .",
    "the mean radio luminosity of the radio sources with @xmath54 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] is about 70 times greater than that of hill et al.s ( 1996 ) @xmath25 sample .",
    "hill et al.infer an opening angle of @xmath68 for their sample and , applying the relationship @xmath20 , we expect @xmath69 , in very good agreement with the value derived directly from the quasar fraction in lrl . using the same value for the density of the torus , @xmath70 , as hill et al . , the receding torus model predicts the distribution of extinctions shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus ] .",
    "although the model does predict fewer lightly - reddened sources than at low redshift ( @xmath71% with @xmath72mag , as opposed to @xmath73% ) , it still overpredicts the number . by increasing the density of the torus by about an order of magnitude above that derived for hill et al.s sample",
    ", we can fit the data of figure  [ fig : torus ] with the dashed line .",
    "since this model is required to reproduce both the numbers of naked and lightly - reddened quasars , there is very little additional information in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus ] with which to compare its predictions",
    ". we can not therefore claim any quantitative agreement between the model and our observations .",
    "there are several points to be made about the receding torus model .",
    "first , one nust be careful when considering objects with low extinction , since there may be additional obscuration which should not be attributed to the torus .",
    "the line of sight to the quasar nucleus could easily suffer a few magnitudes of visual extinction in its passage through the host galaxy , or through foreground companion objects such as those seen in our images of 3c  22 .",
    "the one - sided radio jet displayed by 3c  22 suggests a smaller angle between the radio ( and torus ) axis and the line of sight than in 3c  41 and 3c  65 , which have similar nuclear extinctions , so it is quite possible that the torus provides only a fraction ( if any ) of the obscuration .",
    "in fact , of the four quasar nuclei we detect at @xmath1 , it is only 3c  265 that we can say with reasonable certainty is seen through the heavy obscuration of the torus .",
    "the fact that we have needed to increase one of the parameters of the receding torus model , namely the torus density @xmath70 , to allow the model to fit our data , suggests that some refinements are needed .",
    "the torus density could increase as a function of redshift , or quasar luminosity ( either directly or through the mass of the central black hole or host galaxy ) , or both .",
    "obviously this question can only be answered by examining the distribution of extinctions in a sample selected at a fainter radio flux limit , such as the 7c sample ( selected at a flux level 25 times fainter than lrl ; willott et al.1998a ) although such a study is clearly beyond the capabilities of ukirt .",
    "we can , however , glean something just from the quasar fraction in the 7c sample in the same redshift range , which is consistent with the model s prediction of 11% ( willott et al .",
    "the relatively small number statistics prevent this from being a definitive test , although the agreement is certainly encouraging and suggests that the torus height might be the same in all sources , irrespective of their redshifts and luminosities .",
    "the sensitivity of thermal imaging observations to point sources is essentially limited by two factors .",
    "first , the size of the detection aperture controls the detection threshold , and so the better the image quality achievable , the greater the sensitivity .",
    "secondly , there is effectively a maximum integration time set by the stability of the background from the telescope , and so the rate at which source photons are detected is also important . obviously then , the diffraction - limited images that the new class of 8-m telescopes should be able to obtain at @xmath1 ( @xmath74 ) will enable much deeper observations than we have been able to undertake .    the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; tokunaga et al .",
    "1998 ) to be installed on the 8.3-m subaru telescope in 1999 will be able to achieve a @xmath75 detection of a point source with @xmath76 in 1hour of integration , by using a 05 detection aperture .",
    "for an intrinsic magnitude of @xmath60 , this would allow the detection of the quasar nucleus through as much as @xmath77mag of obscuration .",
    "in reality , the sensitivity will be slightly worse than this due to the presence of the host galaxy which is expected to have @xmath7818 within a 05 aperture ( assuming @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "however , the excellent image quality should enable the nuclear point source , if present , to be separated from the underlying galaxy with relative ease and so much of the increased sensitivity will be retained .    the ability to measure obscuring columns to this depth would provide a much more rigorous test of the receding torus model than could be presented here . the model shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus ] predicts only six sources should be detected with @xmath81 , while the remaining nine will have even larger obscurations . as was discussed in section  [ sec : rtorus ] , it is important not to put too much weight on those sources with low extinction ( @xmath53 ) since some or even all of this material may come from a source other than the torus .",
    "given the apparent evidence that no property of the torus is constant , the predictive power of the receding torus model rests in its ability to infer the obscuration towards the nuclei which are too heavily obscured to be detected directly .",
    "improved sensitivity of the thermal - infrared imaging method will also allow studies at much higher redshifts .",
    "this is an important extension because there are obvious difficulties with forming enough dust for an @xmath82 torus in an arbitrarily short time , so there is likely to be some critical redshift beyond which all radio sources have low @xmath83",
    ".    thermal - infrared imaging may also play an important rle in understanding the intrinsic orientation dependence of quasar emissions .",
    "if the thermal - infrared flux arises from optically - thin material and is isotropic , then statistical studies of , for example , the @xmath84 colours of @xmath0 quasar nuclei could be used to test whether the ( rest - frame ) uv continuum is also isotropic .",
    "low - frequency selected samples , such as those from the 3c and 7c samples , should contain quasars randomly distributed in orientation with @xmath85 , and would provide a suitable basis for such a study .",
    "one possibility would be to look for a correlation between @xmath86 colour ( corrected for reddening ) and radio core dominance .",
    "various studies ( e.g. , netzer 1987 ) have suggested that the uv continua , and the low - ionisation broad emission lines arise in optically - thick disks and thus emit anisotropically .",
    "we have presented the results of a near- and thermal - infrared imaging survey of a representative sample of 19 @xmath0 radio galaxies from the 3cr and 3crr ( lrl ) samples .",
    "four objects were detected at @xmath1 , with red @xmath87 colours which we attributed to partially - obscured quasar light .",
    "we have used our infrared data to infer the nuclear extinctions and contributions from non - stellar light at @xmath8 for these four sources , and find the results to be in excellent agreement with a more detailed analysis incorporating  data .",
    "we deduce that the fraction of dust - reddened quasars at @xmath0 is @xmath6% ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "we find that the non - stellar light provides as much as 80 per cent of the small - aperture @xmath8-band flux in two objects classified as ` radio galaxies ' , although it is unable to account for the brighter @xmath8-magnitudes of 3c radio galaxies compared to 6c radio galaxies at the same redshift , which must therefore be due to a correlation between radio and host galaxy luminosities .",
    "we have also investigated the observed distribution of nuclear extinctions in our sample in the context of the receding torus model .",

    "<S> we present the results of a programme of thermal - infrared imaging of nineteen @xmath0 radio galaxies from the 3cr and 3crr ( lrl ) samples . we detect emission at @xmath1 ( @xmath2 m ) from four objects ; </S>",
    "<S> in each case the emission is unresolved at 1-arcsec resolution . </S>",
    "<S> fifteen radio galaxies remain undetected to sensitive limits of @xmath3 . using these data in tandem with archived  data and near - infrared spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> we show that three of the detected ` radio galaxies ' ( 3c  22 , 3c  41 , and 3c  65 ) harbour quasars reddened by @xmath4 . correcting for this reddening 3c  22 and 3c  41 are very similar to coeval 3c quasars , whilst 3c  65 seems unusually underluminous . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth radio galaxy detection ( 3c  265 ) is a more highly obscured ( @xmath5 ) but otherwise typical quasar which previously has been evident only in scattered light . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the fraction of dust - reddened quasars at @xmath0 to be @xmath6% at 90% confidence . on the assumption that the undetected radio galaxies harbour quasars similar to those in 3c  22 , 3c  41 and 3c  265 ( as seems reasonable given their similar narrow emission line luminosities ) we deduce extinctions of @xmath7 towards their nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of reddened quasar nuclei to the total @xmath8-band light ranges from @xmath9 per cent for the non - detections , through @xmath10 per cent for 3c  265 to @xmath11 per cent for 3c  22 and 3c  41 . correcting for these effects does not remove the previously reported differences between the @xmath8 magnitudes of 3c and 6c radio galaxies , so contamination by reddened quasar nuclei is not a serious problem for drawing cosmological conclusions from the @xmath8@xmath12 relation for radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these results in the context of the ` receding torus ' model which predicts a small fraction of lightly - reddened quasars in samples of high radio luminosity sources . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the likely future importance of thermal - infrared imaging in the study of distant powerful radio sources .    # </S>",
