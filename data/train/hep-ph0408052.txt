    "<S> it is already known that the initial growth of plasma instabilities in qcd closely parallels that in qed . however , once the unstable modes of the gauge - fields grow large enough for non - abelian interactions between them to become important , one might guess that the dynamics of qcd plasma instabilities and qed plasma instabilities become very different . in this paper , we give suggestive arguments that non - abelian self - interactions between the unstable modes are ineffective at stopping instability growth , and that the growing non - abelian gauge fields become approximately abelian after a certain stage in their growth . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn suggests that understanding the development of qcd plasma instabilities in the non - linear regime may have close parallels to similar processes in traditional plasma physics . </S>",
