    "bass 2000 is the archive and database of several ground - based solar instruments such as the nrh ( nanay radio - heliograph ) , the _ observatoire de paris - meudon _ spectroheliograph , the _",
    "pic du midi _ coronograph ( haco , now climso ) and the french - italian telescope thmis installed in tenerife .",
    "bass 2000 is located at two different sites .",
    "its main centre is hosted by the _",
    "observatoire midi - pyrnes _ , and it is situated on the campus of tarbes about 150 km south - west of the main town of toulouse . it is the main database and archive of thmis .",
    "the later archive represents now about 11 to of mostly raw data collected since 1999 .    concerning thmis data",
    ", it is quite important to recall its data policy here . indeed , after a pi - ship of one year , _ all data become public_. on - line query forms are available to users in order to select data of interest for them . afterwards",
    "we take care of supplying to any user the requested data over the network or using standard media , depending on the requested volume , as quickly as possible .",
    "the bass 2000 centre at _ observatoire de paris - meudon _ is mainly in charge of systematic data from other observatories than thmis",
    ". daily images of the meudon spectroheliograph , of the nanay decametric array and radio - heliograph , and of the _ pic du midi _ coronograph are indeed available here .",
    "this centre also provides additional services and tools such as solar ephemeris and reference spectra on - line .    finally , a service aka .",
    "fromage in charge of computing , upon request , extrapolations of photospheric vector magnetic field maps to the corona is now in operations .    since 2006 , vector magnetic field maps are available on - line , when pointing at the tarbes archive s web - page ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for the sake of traceability",
    ", users will be gently asked to be identified before accessing to the data .",
    "inversion of data are made using either a pca - based code @xcite or a levenberg - marquardt code @xcite .        in 2007 ,",
    "automatic reduction and data transfer procedures have been succesfully tested between thmis and bass 2000 .",
    "this has been done during a 3-week campagn together with hinode , last fall .",
    "the experience of the relation between thmis , as a data producer , and bass 2000 , its main archive and associated data base is unique in the solar physics community .    on a short / medium - term basis ,",
    "bass 2000 will aim at providing the best scientific return from thmis data .",
    "we shall therefore carry - on _ upon request _ the backward reduction of mtr @xcite data taken before 2007 , using the standard reduction package @xmath0 provided by the thmis group @xcite .    beyond the production of vector magnetic field maps",
    ", plans are now for allowing data mining in the large set of second solar spectrum for atomic and molecular lines data , for instance .",
    "this is also planned for new solar prominences data taken simultaneously in the visible and near - infrared spectral ranges ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the bass 2000 group is involved in the _",
    "european solar telescope _ design study which will be funded by the european union s fp7 .",
    "our main contribution into the data flow system workpackage will be the survey of the development of virtual observatory standards and tools .",
    "finally , we should open early in 2008 a database for espadons and narval stellar spectropolarimetric data . the first release should deal with @xmath1 1000 spectra taken since 2005 both at the cfht and tbl telescopes mainly on f , g and k - type stars .",
    "our warmest thanks go to nadge meunier , head of bass 2000 during the last 6 years .",
    "we are indebted to the french _ programme national soleil - terre _ and to the _ universit paul sabatier , toulouse 3 _ for their substantial financial support .",
