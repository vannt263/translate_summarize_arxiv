    "in multivariate extensions of garch models , modelers are faced with the problem of correlations ( between asset returns , in most applications ) .",
    "the simplest idea is to assume that these correlations are constant in time , and constitute only an additional matrix of parameters .",
    "this has provided the class of constant conditional correlations models ( ccc ) , first introduced by bollerslev ( 1990 ) . since",
    "ccc models can be seen as the components of first - order markov processes , once such models are rewritten in an extended vector space , it is relatively easy to prove the existence of strictly stationary and explicit solutions , even if the latter are analytically complex : see classical textbooks , for instance francq and zakoan ( 2010 ) .",
    "it rapidly became apparent that the assumption of constant correlations is too strong .",
    "it does not correspond to economic intuition or many empirical features : see the recent paper by otranto and bauwens ( 2013 ) and the numerous references therein , for instance .",
    "therefore , engle ( 2002 ) proposed extending ccc specifications by adding particular dynamics on the ( conditional ) correlation matrices of returns , denoted here by @xmath0 . to ensure",
    "modelers are dealing with true correlation matrices , he introduced a non - linear transform : there exists a sequence of variance - covariance matrices @xmath1 such that @xmath2 , and @xmath1-dynamics are specified instead of @xmath0-dynamics directly , contrary to other authors ( tse and tsui , 2002 or pelletier , 2006 , for instance ) .",
    "this non - linear transform ensures that @xmath3 is always a correlation matrix , i.e. positive semidefinite with ones on its main diagonal .",
    "nonetheless , it considerably complicates the work of stating dcc model stationarity conditions . indeed ,",
    "analytically tractable solutions to such processes no longer exist .",
    "this explains why the existence and uniqueness of dcc model stationarity solutions have not yet been established in the literature , nor have the finiteness of their moments .",
    "particularly , this implies that theoretically sound statistical inference procedures do not yet exist , as noted in caporin and mcaleer ( 2013 ) .    despite their theoretical shortcomings ,",
    "dcc models have been used intensively among academics and practitioners .",
    "besides numerous applied works , several extensions of the baseline dcc representation have been proposed in the literature : inclusion of asymmetries ( cappiello , engle , and sheppard , 2006 ) , volatility thresholds ( kasch and caporin , 2013 ) , macro - variables ( otranto and bauwens , 2013 ) , univariate switching regime probabilities ( pelletier , 2006 , billio and caporin , 2005 , fermanian and malongo , 2013 ) , among others .",
    "other authors have revisited the dcc parameterization itself : billio , caporin , and gobbo ( 2006 ) , franses and hafner ( 2009 ) , etc .",
    "therefore , there is an urgent need for new theoretical results concerning the seminal dcc model itself .    usually in econometrics , proving the existence of stationary solutions",
    "is the first step towards developing a full asymptotic theory ( consistency / asymptotic normality of qml estimates typically , as in comte and lieberman ( 2003 ) in the case of multivariate garch models ) , because laws of large numbers and some clts are easily obtained in this case . in the garch literature",
    ", this essential task has been fulfilled by bougerol and picard ( 1992 ) for univariate garch models , by ling and mcaleer ( 2003 ) for multivariate arma - garch models , and by boussama et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for bekk models . in the case of dcc models , a keystone is missing : a theory for inference has been proposed by engle and sheppard ( 2001 ) , but their two stage estimation procedure is contingent on the underlying dcc process being strictly stationary and ergodic ( see their assumption a.2 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to fill this gap .    after introducing some notations ,",
    "we define dcc models at the beginning of section  [ dccrewriten ] . they will be rewritten as `` almost linear '' markov chains in subsection  [ dccmarkov ] .",
    "the existence of strong and weak stationary solutions is stated in subsection  [ mainres ] .",
    "subsection  [ unicity ] exhibits sufficient conditions to get their uniqueness .",

    "obviously , when such a sequence @xmath93 is initialized with @xmath94 non negative definite ( possibly null ) matrices , every @xmath95 , @xmath96 , will be definite positive . in theorem  [ thmoments ] , we prove that a `` doubly infinite '' stationary sequence @xmath97 of definite positive matrices exists and which satisfies  ( [ qtdef ] ) .    we will set @xmath98_{1\\leq p , q \\leq m}$ ] , @xmath99 , and @xmath100_{1\\leq p , q \\leq m}$ ] , @xmath101 . in practice , the positive matrix @xmath92 ( or the constant vector @xmath102 in @xmath103 equivalently ) is a parameter that has to be estimated , most often during the first stage .",
    "aielli ( 2013 ) noticed that the estimation of the unknown matrix @xmath92 is not straightforward , because it can not be deduced trivially from the unconditional correlation between the standardized residuals @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , he introduced a new variety of dcc - garch models ( called cdcc ) , where  ( [ qtdef ] ) is replaced by @xmath105 under this new assumption , cdcc can be seen as a particular bekk model ( engle and kroner , 1995 ) .",

    "dcc models can no longer be rewritten as bekk models and other techniques have to be found . in this paper , we obtain similar results to aielli ( 2013 ) , but by keeping the original specification of dcc models and without relying on another surrounding family of processes .",
