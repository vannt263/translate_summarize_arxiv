    "considerable interest in the structure of the states at intermediate excitation energy in atomic nuclei has arisen recently @xcite .",
    "the states are excited via different nuclear reactions and the deexcitation populates the low - lying excited states that have a simple structure @xcite .",
    "the study of the electromagnetic transitions coupling low - lying states with those having intermediate energy reveals a delicate interplay between the main excitation modes in atomic nuclei - single - particle and the collective ones @xcite .",
    "isomers have been known for more than 50 years and during this period very precise spectroscopic information about their properties has been obtained ( see , e.g. a review article @xcite ) .",
    "they have relatively low excitation energy and total angular momentum , @xmath9 , which is very different from the angular momentum of the ground state , @xmath10 . due to these specific properties ,",
    "their electromagnetic decay into the ground state is strongly hindered and they are characterized by a half - life from ms to years depending on the value of @xmath11 . the nuclear isomer population is studied by means of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , ( @xmath4 , @xmath14 reactions and @xmath15-decay .",
    "the different nuclear reactions show the contribution of the single - particle and the more complex components in the structure of their wave function .",
    "recently , essential progress in isomer photoexcitation has been achieved by using bremsstrahlung radiation at low values of an end - point energy @xcite .",
    "the isomer yield in spherical nuclei as a function of the end - point energy was found to have a linear dependence in the energy interval of about one mev , the line then breaks , and another linear dependence for one mev takes place .",
    "this effect received its theoretical interpretation as follows : a level or a group of closely lying levels with very specific properties are located at the line break .",
    "the wave function of these excited states includes configurations which allow their intensive excitation from the ground state while some other configurations are responsible for a cascade decay from these levels at intermediate energies which lead to the isomeric state @xcite .",
    "usually the maximum value of the end - point energy in these bremsstrahlung experiments is 44.5 mev .",
    "an alternative way to populate the isomeric states is offered by the @xmath16 reaction , applying the end - point energy of the bremsstrahlung radiation from 10 to 25 mev . in this reaction the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) is initially excited .",
    "the main mechanism of its decay in the heavy nuclei is related to the neutron emission .",
    "the nucleus rests with the excitation energy of 57 mev and decays by @xmath5 transitions into the isomeric and ground states .",
    "since the excitation energy of intermediate states reached in this reaction is relatively high , the statistical approach is usually used for a theoretical interpretation of the @xmath5 decay process @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we present the experimental results for the population of @xmath17 isomers in n=81 isotones in the @xmath16 reaction .",
    "it will be reported that at e@xmath18 = 25 mev the isomeric ratio ( ir ) equals 0.12 , 0.14 , 0.06 and 0.046 in @xmath0ba , @xmath1ce , @xmath2nd and @xmath3sm , respectively .",
    "all these nuclei have identical spins and parities in their isomeric and ground states .",
    "therefore , the ir should not be affected by such factors as the difference between the spin of the isomeric ( @xmath19 ) and ground states ( @xmath20 ) . moreover , the isomeric levels for the isotopes @xmath1ce , @xmath2nd and @xmath3sm have an energy on the order of 755 kev and 661 kev in @xmath0ba .",
    "it is clear that it is not possible to explain the difference between two lighter and two heavier nuclei by statistical properties of intermediate states without additional assumptions .",
    "it means that the structure of the excited states is important even at these excitation energies , and it should be accounted for . for this reason , a microscopic calculation should be applied to explain the a - dependence of the isomer yield which is experimentally observed .",
    "for that purpose , we employ the quasiparticle phonon model ( qpm ) which has already been successfully applied to the interpretation of the isomer population from the intermediate states at lower energies @xcite .    the structure of the states at intermediate excitation energy is rather complex .",
    "the interplay of the simple collective and the more complex modes leads to the fragmentation of the simple excitations .",
    "the experimental data as well as theoretical calculations reveal the spreading of the simple modes in a wide energy region , where large fluctuations in strength are obtained . a convenient approach to describe the fragmentation",
    "is based on the doorway picture@xcite . this approach incorporated in",
    "the qpm permits the description of different processes , where excited states with intermediate energy are included : @xmath5-decay @xcite , nucleon emission @xcite , ect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii some details of the @xmath21 experiment are discussed and the experimental results are presented .",
    "a theoretical treatment of the @xmath21 reaction is given in section iii . in subsection",
    "iii.a we discuss the mechanism of the reaction while details of the nuclear structure calculations in odd mass nuclei within the qpm are given in subsection iii.b .",
    "the results of numeric calculations are discussed in section iv in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the measurements of the ir were performed on the electron accelerator microtron mt-25 of flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions , jinr .",
    "the description of this microtron and its main parameters were published earlier @xcite .",
    "the essential advantage of this accelerator is the small energy spread of the accelerated electrons ( 30 - 40 kev ) at the high beam intensity ( up to an average power 600 w ) .",
    "this allows measurement of the cross sections of the studied nuclides production at the strictly definite end - point energy .",
    "the electron beam extracted from the accelerator chamber was focused by using the quadrupole lenses and directing it on the stopping target , which consists of a 2 mm thick tungsten disk cooled by water .",
    "the electron spot on the target was about 5 mm .",
    "the mean current on the target , 20 @xmath22a , was measured continuously during the experiment .",
    "the energy of the electron beam ( and the upper boundary of the bremsstrahlung ) was changed by two methods : the choice of the proper electron orbit and the tuning of the magnetic field .",
    "the oxides of the studied elements  bao , ce@xmath23o@xmath24 , nd@xmath23o@xmath24 and sm@xmath23o@xmath24 were irradiated by the bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "they have a weight of @xmath25  100 mg , a surface area @xmath25  1  @xmath26 and were enriched by the studied isotope up to 93% .",
    "the irradiation time was 10 min for each target .",
    "the irradiation flux was monitored by cu activation foils that were irradiated simultaneously with the samples .",
    "about one min after the end of irradiation , the residual activity from the isotones samples and cu monitor , were measured separately by a calibrated 60  @xmath27 ge(li ) detector with an energy resolution of @xmath28 2.5 kev for e@xmath18 = 1332 kev of @xmath29co .",
    "the detector was operated in a lead shielding chamber lined with a 10 cm thick wall .",
    "measurements have been repeated to determine experimentally the half - life of the radioactive nuclides under study .",
    "the spectra were processed according to the activ code , which permits separating @xmath5-lines with close energies in the complicated spectrum .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows one of the measured @xmath5-spectrum obtained upon irradiating an enriched @xmath30sm isotope by bremsstrahlung with an endpoint energy of 25 mev .",
    "the @xmath5-lines corresponding to @xmath31 decay of unstable @xmath3sm in the ground and the isomeric states into @xmath3pm are clearly seen in the spectrum .",
    "the ir is determined by the ratio of the measured nuclei yields in the isomeric and the ground state : @xmath32 where the index @xmath33 and @xmath34 is attributed to the isomeric and ground states , respectively ; @xmath35 is the yield of isomeric or ground state , and e@xmath36 is the maximum endpoint energy . the ratio of the yield is connected with the areas under the @xmath5 peaks corresponding to the isomeric and ground states ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ) by the equation @xmath39^{-1}~ ,   \\label{gan2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a conversion coefficient of @xmath5-radiation , @xmath41 is the probability of the @xmath5-ray emission , @xmath42 is the efficiency of the ge(li ) detector for the corresponding @xmath5-line , @xmath43 is the decay constant , @xmath44 is the probability of the transition from an isomeric to a ground state , and the time factor @xmath45 that takes into account the accumulation and decay of the nuclei is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are the times of irradiation , decay , and measurement . because the isomeric and ground states were obtained in the same exposure run , and because the required quantities ( yields or cross sections ) were measured for them under identical conditions , the errors associated with the intensities of the bremsstrahlung flux and the geometry of exposures and measurements were eliminated in the determining irs .",
    "the produced in @xmath50 reactions nuclei are radioactive both in the ground and isomeric states ( except @xmath0ba ) .",
    "therefore it was possible to determine the yields of studied nuclei in the ground and isomeric states simultaneously by measuring the intensity of the emitted @xmath5-radiation using eq .",
    "( [ gan2 ] ) . for @xmath0ba",
    "the ir determination by direct method becomes impossible for the lack of the appropriate @xmath5-lines in the ground state .",
    "thus , the possibilities of isomer production of @xmath51ba isomer via @xmath50 reactions were investigated at energies @xmath52 = 10 - 25 mev .",
    "the yield of @xmath51ba was compared with the yield of monitoring reaction .",
    "the cross section for the reaction @xmath53cu@xmath54,n)@xmath55cu measured in a beam of quasimonochromatic photons was taken for the reference @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of reaction cross section , employing an iterative procedure , was depicted in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the cross section for @xmath50 reactions with production of the @xmath51ba isomeric state . in order to determine ir ,",
    "the @xmath51ba cross section was subtracted from the total @xmath56ba cross section @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath0ba , the ir was defined as a cross section ratio .",
    "the values of these ir are in accordance with the previous results @xcite . the ir dependence on the endpoint energy is also given in fig .",
    "three main regions of ir behavior are recognized .",
    "the first region is from the neutron threshold to a maximum in the photoabsorption cross section where the ir increases sharply . in the second region ( from 16 to 21  mev ) of the high - energy tail of the gdr ,",
    "the ir changes slightly . above 21  mev where the gdr tail becomes very weak , the ir turns out to be practically constant . since the spin and parity of a compound nucleus does not change ( it is always @xmath57 after dipole absorption ) , the observed increase in the ir is due to the enlargement of the interval of excitation energies of a residual nucleus in which photons that result in the population of the isomeric state occur .",
    "the ir at e@xmath36 = 25 mev are presented in the table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the values of these ir are in accordance with the previous results @xcite , but they are more precise . we have also added the ir for @xmath2nd and @xmath3sm from the @xmath58-decay of @xmath2pm and @xmath3eu , respectively .",
    "they are obtained from the analysis of the decay schemes of @xmath2pm and @xmath3eu @xcite .",
    "the process of the isomer population in @xmath21 reactions is rather complex and may be split into a few stages . in the first stage ,",
    "the gdr is excited by bremsstrahlung radiation . in the second",
    ", it quickly decays into the compound nucleus .",
    "next , the compound nucleus decays by emitting of neutrons , leaving the ( a-1 ) nucleus with an excitation energy of a few mev . in the last stage , the nucleus deexcites by direct or cascade @xmath5-transitions into the isomeric or ground state .",
    "since the width of @xmath5-decay strongly decreases with an increase of the multipolarity , the decays are mainly due to @xmath6- , @xmath8- or @xmath7-transitions .",
    "the excited states of the nucleus at intermediate energies , via which the isomers are populated , are called activated states ( as ) . the specific properties of the as are the following : first , due to their total angular momentum and some components of their wave function , they tend to decay into the isomer than into the ground state . secondly , the as should be excited themselves . the last depends on the nuclear reaction considered .",
    "for example , in bremsstrahlung experiments with the end - point energy of a few mev , the as state must have a total angular momentum not very different from those of the ground state in order to make their electromagnetic excitation with low multipolarity from the ground state possible .",
    "if @xmath21 reaction is applied , the as should have the total spin close to 1 since emitted neutrons in the gdr decay tend to take away a small angular momentum .",
    "thus , in principle , different as may be involved in the population of isomers in the different nuclear reactions .    to some extent , the observed variations in the ir values can be associated with the distinctions between the excitation energy and the angular momentum distributions of the final nucleus prior to the photon direct or cascade decay populating the isomeric and ground state . in @xmath21 reactions , the excitation energy and the angular momentum distributions",
    "are determined by neutron emission from an excited nucleus produced as the result of photon absorption .",
    "the angular momentum distribution for the reaction @xmath50 on ba , ce , nd , and sm isotopes are similar . in this process",
    ", the neutron it emits from the state of an initial nucleus with spin and parity @xmath57 ( dipole absorption ) is followed by the population of the residual nucleus state with a spin @xmath60 ( ground state ) or @xmath61 ( isomeric state ) .",
    "when the isomer population is such that all the nuclei under study are characterized by equal spins at each steps of the reaction , the ir is determined by the excitation energy with which the nuclei rest after neutron decay . in the latter case ,",
    "the energy distribution was comparatively broad due to the bremsstrahlung spectrum of the @xmath5 radiation .",
    "the width of this distribution is mainly defined by the photoabsorption lorentzian curve which is very similar to the studied isotones .",
    "the mean value of the excitation energy distribution , e@xmath62 , equals @xmath63 where e@xmath64 is the effective excitation energy , @xmath65 is the neutron binding energy , and @xmath66 is the kinetic energy of the neutron escaping from the compound nucleus .",
    "a peculiarity of the photonuclear reaction with a bremsstrahlung radiation is related to the fact that the whole bremsstrahlung spectrum is involved in the process of photoexcitation .",
    "the energy centroid is determined by the ratio @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a threshold energy , @xmath69 is the cross section for the absorption of a photon with energy e@xmath18 by a nucleus , and @xmath70 is the number of photons with energy @xmath71 in the bremsstrahlung spectrum .",

    "it follows from the presented figures that the ir defined in eq .",
    "( [ ir ] ) depends strongly on the maximum excitation energy of the final nucleus .",
    "the number of excited states at intermediate energies involved in the process varies when the excitation energy is changed and the number of large @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 transitions populating isomeric and ground state is also changed .",
    "the available experimental information obtained in @xmath16 reaction on the ir for n=81 nuclei is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is completed by the ir in two heaviest isotones known from @xmath58 decay data @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath2nd and @xmath3sm , two values of the ir are known corresponding to different maximum excitation energies , e@xmath179",
    ". the calculated values of the ir of eq .",
    "( [ ir ] ) are given in table  [ tab1 ] for comparison .",
    "the truncation of the as included in the calculation by maximum excitation energy is made in accordance with experimental conditions .",
    "the calculated values agree very well with the measured ones .",
    "the energy dependence of the ir in the case of @xmath2nd and @xmath3sm is reproduced . in the case of @xmath3sm up to excitation energy 3.5 mev",
    "there are two states - @xmath147 at 3.48 mev and @xmath153 at 3.46 mev .",
    "these states are connected with the isomer by e1 and e2 transitions .",
    "the increase of the excitation energy up to 4.72 mev does not influence the value of @xmath180 while the value of @xmath159 is changed due to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 transitions connected the @xmath181 and @xmath170 states with the ground state .",
    "the situation is similar in @xmath2nd .",
    "the ir in n = 81 and z = 56  62 nuclei obtained in ( @xmath5,n ) reaction on the beam of bremsstrahlung were measured . the large difference of the ir for the studied nuclei was observed in spite of the similar properties of the isomeric states .",
    "the measured values are completed by available experimental information obtained from @xmath182 decay .",
    "the new set of data reveals a dependence of the ir on a maximum excitation energy of residual nuclei reached in ( @xmath5,n ) reaction and @xmath182 decay .    the calculation of the ir in the framework of qpm is done .",
    "it is shown that the value of the ir depends on the contribution of the corresponding single - particle component in the structure of the wave function of the excited state .",
    "the ir as a function of the excitation energy of a residual nucleus is determined by the fluctuation in the distribution of the single - particle components .",
    "the maximum energy of the intermediate states populated in ( @xmath5,n ) reaction is responsible for the truncation of the states involved in the forthcoming decay to the ground and isomeric states .",
    "that is why the ir in @xmath0ba and @xmath1ce with somewhat higher values of the maximum excitation energy is different from the ones in @xmath2nd and @xmath3sm .",
    "our calculation reproduces rather well the ir dependence on a as well as the absolute values of the ir in all isotones under consideration .    the present work is partly supported by the bulgarian science foundation ( contract ph . 626 ) and plovdiv university ( contract pu f23 ) .",
