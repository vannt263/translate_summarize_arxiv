    "in response to the astounding discovery of the late - time acceleration of the expansion rate of the universe @xcite , a number of large - scale supernova ( ) surveys were launched .",
    "these experiments included programs to observe low redshift  such as the nearby supernova factory @xcite , the carnegie supernova project @xcite , and the center for astrophysics  program @xcite . at higher redshift ,",

    "observations by @xcite . at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "the sloan digital sky survey (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) bridged the gap between the local and distant  searches by providing repeat observations of a 300  deg@xmath1 stripe of sky at the equator ( known as stripe 82 ) and discovered thousands of type ia  ( a ) over the redshift range @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this paper presents all data collected over the last decade as part of the  survey .",
    "this search was a dedicated multi - band , magnitude - limited survey , which provided accurate multi - color photometry for tens of thousands of transient objects , all with a well - determined detection efficiency .",
    "the data have lead to precise measurements of the  rate as a function of redshift , environment , and  type @xcite , and have lead to important new constraints on cosmology with detailed studies of systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the large survey volume and high cadence have enabled early discoveries of rare events @xcite , as well as detailed statistical studies of normal events @xcite .",
    "the extensive , well - calibrated  galaxy catalog has also helped revolutionize the study of a  and the dependence on their host - galaxy properties .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite showed a clear correlation between  hubble residuals and the stellar mass of the host .",
    "the origin of this correlation remains unclear , but @xcite found evidence for the correlation being due to the age of the stellar population ( cf .",
    "* ) , while @xcite found the correlation was likely related to the gas - phase metallicity using a sub - sample of star - forming  host galaxies . @xcite",
    "have used the fundamental metallicity relation @xcite to further reduce the hubble residuals , suggesting again that metallicity is the underlying physical parameter responsible for the correlation .",
    "@xcite , however , did not detect an obvious correlation between hubble residuals and distance to the  from the center of the host galaxy , as might be expected due to metallicity gradients , but the are not as sensitive as the more direct metallicity measurements presentend in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that extinction and a  color decrease with increasing distance from the center of the host , and that the average  light curve shape differs significantly in elliptical and spiral galaxies as seen in many previous studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a  properties in rich galaxy clusters are , on average , different from those in passive field galaxies , possibly due to differences in age of the stellar populations .",
    "finally , @xcite studied the effects of weak gravitational lensing on the  a  distance measurements .",
    "the  spectra presented in this data release are a collection of data from 11 different telescopes and includes some spectra taken to determine galaxy properties long after the  had faded .",
    "we did not attempt a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the full sample beyond transient classification and redshift measurement , but subsets of the data were previously published @xcite and analyzed to quantitatively measure spectral features @xcite .    since spectra were not obtained for all discovered transients ( as is true for all  surveys )",
    ", @xcite analyzed the light curves of the full sample of variable objects and identified @xmath7 purely photometric a  candidates with quantitative estimates for the classification efficiency and sample purity . in the absence of a  spectrum ,",
    "the identification and placement of a  on a hubble diagram is greatly aided by a knowledge of the host - galaxy redshift .",
    "many host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts were measured by the  and  surveys , but the  @xcite baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (;",
    "@xcite ) ancillary program @xcite provided redshifts for most of the observable  host galaxies . @xcite and @xcite presented hubble diagrams using photometric  classification and host redshifts , and demonstrated that statistically competitive cosmological constraints can be obtained with limited spectroscopic follow up of active  candidates .",
    "the  work on photometric identification represents an important example analysis for ongoing and future large surveys , such as pan - starrs  @xcite , des  @xcite and lsst  @xcite , where full spectroscopic follow up of all active  candidates will be impractical .",

    "the  data were obtained during three - month campaigns in the fall of 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 as part of the extension of the original .",
    "a small amount of engineering data were collected in 2004 @xcite , but are not included in this paper , since the cadence and survey duration were not adequate for detailed light curve studies .",
    "the  telescope @xcite and imaging camera @xcite produce photometric measurements in each of the @xmath0  filters @xcite spanning the wavelength range of 350 to 1000  nm .",
    "the most useful filters for observing  , however , are _ g _ , _ r _ , and _ i _ because the  are difficult to detect in _ u _ and _ z _ except at low redshifts ( @xmath8 for a ) due to the relatively poor throughput of those filters .",
    "the  survey is a `` rolling search '' , where a portion of the sky is repeatedly scanned to discover new  and to measure the light curves of the ones previously discovered .",
    "the survey observed stripe 82 , which is 2.5  wide in declination between right ascension of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the camera is operated in drift scan mode with all filters being observed nearly simultaneously with a fixed exposure time of 55 seconds each . full coverage of stripe82 was obtained in two nights ( with offset camera positions ) , but the average cadence was approximately four nights because of inclement weather and interference from moonlight . the coverage and cadence of the survey is shown in figure  [ fig : run_coverage ] .",
    "the repeated scans were used by @xcite to produce and analyze deep coadded images .",
    "the survey is sensitive to a  beyond a redshift of 0.4 , but beyond a redshift of 0.2 the completeness , and the ability to obtain high - quality photometry , deteriorates .",
    "the  camera images were processed by the  imaging software @xcite and  were identified via a frame subtraction technique @xcite .",
    "objects detected after frame subtraction in two or more filters were placed in a database of detections .",
    "these detected objects were scanned visually and were designated candidates if they were not obvious artifacts .",
    "spectroscopic measurements were made for promising candidates depending on the availability and capabilities of telescopes .",
    "the candidate selection and spectroscopic identification have been described by @xcite . in three observing seasons , the  survey discovered 10,258  _ new _ variable objects and spectroscopically identified 500  a  and 81  core - collapse  ( ) .",

    "the full catalog is made available online ; a small portion is reproduced as an example in table  [ tbl : cand ] .",
    "general photometric properties include the j2000 coordinates of the  candidate , the number of epochs detected by the search pipeline ( ` nsearchepoch ` ) and final photometry pipeline above  @xmath11 ( ` nepochsnr5 ` ) , and @xmath12-band magnitude ( ` peakrmag ` ) and  ( ` mjdatpeakrmag ` ) of the brightest measurement .",
    "we show the distribution of ` nepochsnr5 ` for all candidates in figure  [ fig : nepoch ] as an indication of the general quality of the light curves .",
    "we provide the heliocentric redshift ( ` zspechelio ` ) and uncertainty ( ` zspecerrhelio ` ) when spectroscopic measurements are available .",

    "the galaxy spectra include cases where the galaxy spectrum is obtained from the  spectroscopic observation but with an aperture chosen to enhance the galaxy light and cases where a spectrum was taken when the  was no longer visible for the purpose of measuring the galaxy redshift and possibly other galaxy properties .",
    "galaxy spectra that were taken with the  spectrograph @xcite are not included in these totals , but ` objidhost ` gives  8 object index so that the galaxy properties may be easily extracted from the  database .",
    "spectra as part of the  program are also not included in these totals .",
    "they are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , but their redshifts are listed under ` zspechelio ` .",
    "finally , we provide the cmb - frame redshifts and uncertainties in ` zcmb ` and ` zerrcmb ` , respectively .    some sources ( most of the spectroscopically identified )",
    "were assigned a standard name by the iau ; the name is listed for those sources that have been assigned one . the peak @xmath12-band magnitude observed is plotted versus redshift in figure [ fig : magvsz ] .    the candidates are classified according to their light curves and spectra ( when available ) , and the results of the classification are shown in table  [ tbl : cand ] .",
    "visual scanning removed most of the artifacts , so almost all of the objects in the catalog are variable astronomical sources , some of which are only visible for a limited period of time ( for example , supernovae ) .",
    "the multi - night requirement eliminates rapidly moving objects , which are primarily main - belt asteroids .",
    "a summary of the number of objects in each classification is shown in table  [ tbl : typetotal ] .",
    "the classification `` unknown '' means that the light curve was too sparse and/or noisy to make a useful classification , `` variable '' means that the source was observed in more than one observing season , and `` agn '' means that an optical spectrum was identified as having features associated with an active galaxy , primarily broad hydrogen emission lines .",
    "the other categories separate the source light curves into 3  types : type ii , type ibc ( either ib or ic ) , and type ia .",
    "a prefix `` p '' indicates a purely - photometric type where the redshift is unknown and that the identification has been made with the photometric data only .",
    "a prefix `` z '' indicates that a redshift is measured from its candidate host galaxy and the classification uses that redshift as a prior .",
    "the  classifications without a prefix are made based on a spectrum ( including a few non-  spectra ) .",
    "the type ib and ic spectra identifications are shown separately .",
    "the `` a ? '' classification is based on a spectrum that suggests a a  but is inconclusive .",
    "the details and estimated accuracy of the classification scheme are given in the next section .",
    "some of the  candidates in the catalog have associated notes .",
    "notes indicate  where the typing spectrum was obtained by other groups ( and is not included in the  data release ) and indicate  candidates that may have peculiar features .",
    "the bulk of the spectroscopically identified a  are consistent with normal a  features , but a few were identified as having some combination of peculiar spectral and light curve features .",
    "we did not search for these peculiar features in a systematic way , but we have noted the likely peculiar features that were found .",
    "some a  have poor fits to the a  light curve model or unlikely parameters for normal a , but we have not noted these , preferring to just present the fit parameters .",
    "table [ tbl : notes ] describes the codes that may appear in the notes column ( item 136 ) of table  [ tab : fullcatalog ] .",
    "this section describes our method for photometric classification of the  candidates .",
    "first , we reject likely non-  events as those showing variability over two or more seasons .",
    "the exact nature of these sources is not known , but the majority are most likely variable stars and active galactic nuclei . a total of 3225  are identified as `` variable '' in table  [ tbl : cand ] .",
    "all remaining candidates showed variability during only a single season and are therefore viable  candidates .",
    "their light curves were then analyzed with the photometric  identification ( ) software @xcite , first developed for spectroscopic targeting and subsequently extended to identify and analyze photometric a  samples . in short , the software compares the observed photometry against a grid of a  light curve models and core - collapse  ( ) templates , and computes the bayesian probabilities of whether the candidate belongs to a type ia , ib / c , or ii .",
    "the technique is similar to that developed by @xcite , except that we subclassify the  into type  ib / c and ii .",
    "extensive tests and tuning were performed using the large ( but still limited ) sample of spectroscopic confirmations from  and simulations as described in @xcite .",
    "the light curve templates used in the analysis presented here are the same as those from @xcite .  and the templates are now part of the  package @xcite .",
    "the bayesian probabilities are useful because they represent the _ relative _ likelihood of  types , whereas the best - fit minimum reduced @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , or more precisely the fit probability @xmath15 , provides an _ absolute _ measure of the likelihood .",
    "the combination of the bayesian probability ( @xmath16 ) and the goodness - of - fit ( @xmath15 ) provides reliable classification of a  candidates .",
    "the expected level of contamination and efficiency can be estimated from either large datasets or simulations .",
    "@xcite used this method to identify a  candidates from .",
    "the a  classification purity and efficiency were estimated to be 91% and 94% , respectively .",
    "the one major drawback of this techinique , however , was the general unreliability of classifying .",
    "to make further improvements , we developed an extension to  that uses the bayesian classification described above as an _ initial _ filter , but subsequently refines the classification using a kd - tree nearest - neighbor ( nn ) technique .",
    "we call this method , and it is based on the fact that different  types populate a distinct region in extinction , light - curve shape , and redshift parameter space when fit to an a  model .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : zdm_zav ] .",
    "b / c  are generally redder ( large @xmath17 ) and they fade more rapidly ( large @xmath18 ) compared to a. , on the other hand , have broad , flat light curves ( small @xmath18 ) . as described below , this method makes substantial improvements to both a  and  classification .    in this method ,",
    "every  in the data sample is compared against a training set and the most likely type is determined from the statistics of its neighbors in a multi - dimensional parameter space . ideally , the training set is a large , uniform , and unbiased sample of spectroscopically confirmed , but such training sets do not exist at the low - flux limit of the  sample .",
    "our current implementation , therefore , uses simulated  from .",
    "the simulation is based on well - measured  template light curves , which are used to simulate events of different magnitudes and redshifts . however , the underlying library is small ( only 42  template light curves ) , and adequacy of this sample size has yet to be rigorously verified .",
    "we simulated 10 seasons worth of  candidates using a mix of a , b / c , and  identical to that used in the  classification challenge @xcite .",
    "for each  candidate in the data sample , we calculate cartesian distances in 3-dimensional parameter space ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) to each simulated  ( labeled @xmath20 ) using the following formula : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are coefficients determined and optimized using simulations for both the data and training sets .",
    "the classification probabilities are determined by counting the numbers of a , b / c , and  in the training set that are within a certain distance @xmath25 . since",
    "this distance is degenerate with the overall normalization of the other three coefficients , we set @xmath26 .",
    "the optimized set of coefficients are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 assuming @xmath30 . for each  candidate in the data sample",
    "we count the number of simulated  from each type @xmath31 within @xmath32 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor probabilities @xmath33 are then determined using , @xmath34    the final classification is performed using the bayesian , nearest - neighbor , and fit probabilities . for a candidate to be a photometric a  candidate , we require ,    * @xmath16  @xmath35 @xmath36  and @xmath16  @xmath35 @xmath37 * @xmath38  @xmath35 @xmath39  and @xmath38  @xmath35 @xmath40 * @xmath15@xmath41 for a  model * detections at @xmath42 @xmath43@xmath44  days and @xmath45 @xmath43@xmath46  days .    for the photometric b / c  candidates , we require ,    * ( @xmath36  @xmath35 @xmath16  and @xmath36  @xmath35 @xmath37 ) or ( @xmath16  @xmath35 @xmath36  and @xmath16  @xmath35 @xmath37 ) * @xmath39  @xmath35 @xmath38  and @xmath39  @xmath35 @xmath40 .",

    "the classification is performed using a spectroscopic redshift prior if a spectrum of either the  candidate or its host galaxy is available . in these cases ,",
    "the candidates are classified as za , zbc , or z  in table  [ tbl : cand ] .",
    "otherwise , we use a flat redshift prior and the candidates are denoted pa , pbc , or p.    all candidates that do not meet any of the criteria above are declared `` unknown '' .",
    "the statistics of the  candidate classification are shown in table  [ tbl : typetotal ] .",
    "simulation results are shown in figure  [ fig : type_compare ] where we compare classification performance between the bayesian - only method and with the nearest - neighbor probabilities .",
    "for the bayesian - only method , the a  classification figure - of - merit ( defined as the product of the efficiency and purity ) has a very broad maximum when we require @xmath16  @xmath35 0.5 , where the efficiency and purity are 98% and 90% , respectively . for the bayesian with the nearest - neighbor probabilities , the figure - of - merit also peaks for @xmath16  @xmath35 0.5 , where the efficiency and purity are both 96% .",
    "note the substantial improvement in the purity at the expense of some reduction in efficiency .",
    "this level of purity is not attainable even with the most stringent cut ( e.g. , @xmath16",
    "@xmath47 ) with the bayesian - only method .",

    ".  assumes that the pixel data can be described by the sum of a point source that is fixed in space but varying in magnitude with time , a galaxy background that is constant in time but has an arbitrary spatial distribution , and a sky background that is constant over a wider area but varies in brightness at each observation .",
    "the galaxy background is parameterized as an arbitrary amplitude on a @xmath48 grid of pixels of size @xmath49 .",
    "the fitting process accounts for the variations in point spread function ( ) to model the distribution of light for each night of observation . the  magnitudes and  reference stars on the same image",
    "are measured simultaneously using the same  so the  magnitudes are measured relative to a calibrated  star catalog .",
    "a complete set of light curve photometric data for all 10,258  candidates is given on the  data release web page @xcite .",
    "the format of the data is described on the web page and is the same as the previously released first - year data sample @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes quoted in these data files , and elsewhere in this paper , are the  standard inverse hyperbolic sine magnitudes defined by @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are given in the  native system and differ from the  system by an additive constant given in ",
    "[ aboffset ] .",
    "the fluxes in those files , however , have been -corrected and are expressed in @xmath50j . the magnitudes and fluxes are reported in a way that is consistent with the first - year data sample except that the calibration of  native magnitudes to @xmath50j has changed as described below in  [ aboffset ] .",
    "quality flags defined by @xcite are provied for each photometric measurement .",
    "special attention should be given to the non - zero flags as they are indicators of subtle problems in  fitting procedure .",
    "a substantial effort has been made to ensure accurate estimates of the uncertainties in the  light curve flux measurements .",
    "an important feature of  is that it works on the original images ( _ i.e. _ , without resampling pixels ) so that a simple propagation of pixel - by - pixel uncertainties from photo - electron statistics offers a robust estimate of the photometric uncertainty .",
    "the galaxy model is remapped for each image , but the galaxy is well measured in the reference images and the error is almost always subdominant .",
    "in addition to the pixel statistical uncertainty ,  computes a `` frame error '' that accounts for zero point uncertainty , galaxy model uncertainty , and systematic sky background uncertainty .",
    "the error model was tested by @xcite using pre - explosion epochs ( known zero flux ) , artificial supernovae ( computer generated ) , and real stars .",
    "the conclusion was that the error model provides a good description of the observed photometric errors .",
    "after running the  code , we re - examined the photometric errors by examining the light curve residuals relative to the  @xcite model .",
    "we also investigated the distribution of residuals using pre - explosion epochs , where the residuals do not depend on the a  model .",
    "for these data the largest errors arise from statistical uncertainties and possible errors in modeling the galaxy background light .",
    "we also examined the distribution of residuals relative to the  light curve model when there was a significant signal ( more than 2@xmath5 above the sky background ) . in this latter case ,",
    "uncertainties in the light curve model and zeropoints contribute to the width of the distribution of residuals .",
    "for these tests we used spectroscopically confirmed a  excluding peculiar types and further limited the sample to those  whose  fit parameters indicated normal stretch @xmath51 and low extinction @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53-band distributions of the normalized residuals ( residual divided by the uncertainty ) are shown in left - hand panels of figure [ fig : errorfudge ] . a normal gaussian distribution ( not a fit )",
    "is shown for comparison .",
    "while both distributions are quite close to the expected normal gaussian , the pre - explosion epoch distribution ( upper left ) is slightly wider than the curve and the distribution with significant signal ( @xmath54 ) is narrower . the normalized residual distribution for the pre - explosion epochs could be larger if the photometry underestimates the error in modeling the galaxy background .",
    "when there is significant signal , the distribution of normalized residuals could be smaller because of an overestimate of the zero - pointing error or the light curve model uncertainty , which is included in the estimated errors .",
    "since the zero - point errors are at least partially correlated between epochs , the fit parameters ( especially the  color parameter ) can absorb part of the zero - point error , and therefore decrease the width of the distribution of residuals . while the measurement errors are considerably larger in @xmath55 and @xmath19 bands , the distribution of the normalized residuals are similar for the other  filters , indicating that the error estimates are approximately correct .",
    "based on these distributions , we adjusted the errors according to the prescription @xmath56 the constant @xmath57 was adjusted to result in an rms of unity for the pre - explosion epoch distributions .",
    "these small adjustments are within the errors quoted by @xcite .",
    "the values used for the error adjustments for all five filters are shown in table  [ tab : sigmafudge ] .",
    "the resulting @xmath53-band distributions of normalized residuals are shown on the right - hand side of figure [ fig : errorfudge ] .",
    "our choice of the form in equation ( [ eqn : sigmafudge ] ) also slightly reduces the width of the distribution of residuals with @xmath54 .",
    "we did not attempt additional modifications to the errors to bring the @xmath54 distribution closer to a normal gaussian because of the additional uncertainties in interpretation . as a consequence ,",
    "our error adjustment has the effect of deweighting low flux measurements relative to measurements with significant flux .",
    "the adjustment has the most effect on @xmath55-band , where it is common to have many points measured with large errors . the overall  lightcurve fit mean confidence level ( derived from the @xmath13/dof )",
    "is increased from 0.28 to 0.57 as a result of this change .",
    "we also observe a small , but statistically significant offset in the mean residual of the pre - explosion epochs .",
    "the largest offset was found for @xmath12-band where the offset was @xmath58 , where @xmath5 is the width of the normalized distribution .",
    "we did not correct this offset because we were uncertain whether subtracting a constant flux from all epochs would be an appropriate correction .",
    "we did determine , however , that adding a constant flux offset to our data had a negligible effect on the  light curve fit probability .",
    "the star catalog calibration is discussed in detail by @xcite , where the  stellar photometry calibration is described in detail and the  photometry is compared with the supernova legacy survey ( ) photometry .",
    "the starting point for the  calibration is a preliminary version of the @xcite star catalog that was used for  photometry in @xcite .",
    "this catalog uses the stellar locus to calibrate the stellar colors but relies on photometry from the  photometric telescope ( ) to establish the relative zeropoint for @xmath12-band . as explained in detail by @xcite",
    ", there is a significant flat - fielding error in the  photometry , leading to a photometry that was biased as a function of declination .",
    "we determined corrections to the @xcite star catalog using  data release  8 @xcite , whose calibration is based on the method of @xcite .",
    "this method , the so - called `` ubercal '' method , re - determines the nightly zeropoints based only on the internal consistency of the 2.5 m telescope observations .",
    "our adjustments to the stellar photometry were typically within a range of 2% , but corrections of up to 5% were made in the @xmath55-band .",
    "the corrections improved the agreement with the  photometry .",
    "instead of recomputing the  magnitudes relative to the new star catalog , we simply applied the corrections to the  magnitudes found using the @xcite catalog .",
    "neither the star catalog of @xcite ( based on the stellar locus ) nor  data release 8 attempts to improve the absolute calibration of  photometry .",
    "the photometry is tied to an absolute scale by bd+174708 using the magnitudes determined by @xcite .",
    "we have followed @xcite and re - determined the absolute scale using the  filter response curves @xcite and the _ _  standard spectra @xcite given in the",
    "_ _  calspec database @xcite .",
    "when the synthetic photometry of these standards is compared to the  photometry , we obtain an absolute calibration , which is expressed as ``  offsets '' from the nominal  calibration ( see @xcite for a description of the  magnitude system ) .",
    "the differences between our current results and those of @xcite are that we have : 1 ) used the recently published  filter response curves , 2 ) used more recent _ _  spectra , and 3 ) re - derived the  to 2.5 m telescope photometric transformation , including corrections for the recently discovered non - uniformity of the  flat field .",
    "details of  system calibration may be found in @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : aboff ] lists the  offsets to be applied to the  data .",
    "we use the average of three solar analogs ( p041c , p177d , and p330e ) because these stars are similar in color to the stars used to determine the ( assumed ) linear color transformation between the  and 2.5 m telescope .",
    "the uncertainty is calculated from the dispersion of the results for the solar analogs .",
    "the value determined for bd+174708 is given as a consistency check .",
    "the most significant numerical difference between the  offsets presented here and table 1 of @xcite is the @xmath55-band offset with @xmath59  @xmath60 , which differs primarily because of the different filter response curve for @xmath55-band , as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the  light curve photometry is given in the  natural system  the same system that is used for all the  data releases .",
    "the  offsets must be added to the  light curve magnitudes in order to place them on a calibrated  system",
    ".      there has been some concern in the literature about the accuracy of the @xmath55-band photometry .",

    "first we examined the images of several hundred of the lowest redshift candidates , since there are relatively few of them and they can exhibit some of the issues with host matching listed in the previous paragraph .",

    "however , we did not assign a host based on visual inspection if there was no corresponding object in the 8 catalog .",
    "we found 36 cases where the host selected by choosing the smallest @xmath102  disagreed with the visual scanning result .",
    "most of these were caused by improperly deblended galaxies or regions where there were multiple candidates and visual pattern recognition proved superior ; poor estimate of the galaxy size parameters was likely a factor in these corrections .",

    "we can derive several such properties by fitting host galaxy photometry to galaxy spectral energy distribution ( ) models .",
