    "<S> such nuclear motion can be generated , e.g. , in ionic crystals illuminated by a strong driving optical laser field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that deflection of the incident @xmath0 beam into the bragg angle can be switched on and off by nuclear vibrations on a superradiant time scale determined by the collective nuclear frequency @xmath1 , which is of the order of terahertz . </S>",
    "<S> namely , if the incident @xmath0 wave is detuned from the nuclear transition by frequency @xmath2 it passes through the static nuclear array . however , if the nuclei vibrate with frequency @xmath3 then parametric resonance can yield energy transfer into the bragg deflected beam on the superradiant time scale , which can be used for fast control of @xmath4 rays . </S>"
