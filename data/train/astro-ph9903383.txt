    "absolute flux density calibration is an important issue for all astronomical observations .",
    "most absolute calibration efforts have occurred at lower frequencies ( @xmath2 ghz ) since it is easier to measure the far - field properties of antennas in this regime , or to use feed systems of calculable gain .",
    "see , for example , conway et al .",
    "( 1963 ) , kellermann ( 1964 ) , kellermann et al . ( 1969 ) , baars ( 1977 ) and references therein .",
    "most of these flux density scales are based upon measurements of the supernova remnant cassiopeia a ( cas a ) with horn - type or dipole antennas . at higher frequencies",
    "this endeavor is substantially more difficult , and investigators have often used flux densities extrapolated from low frequencies or computed from theoretical models of celestial sources .",
    "one exception is the work of wrixon  ( 1972 ) , who measured the brightness temperature of jupiter at frequencies between 20.5 and 33.5 ghz with a 20 foot antenna at the hat creek observatory ; this telescope was calibrated with a far - field transmission / reception measurement .",
    "this measurement was the basis of the calibration used for the sze measurements of myers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but given the relatively large ( @xmath3 ) uncertainty in wrixon s @xmath4 it is desirable to improve upon this .",
    "this paper presents an _ absolute _ measurement with an accuracy of @xmath5 of the flux density of cas a at 32 ghz , a calibrator commonly used at all frequencies and the second brightest extrasolar source in the sky in our observing band .",
    "while absolute calibration is an important consideration for many different types of experiments , our calibration efforts were undertaken with the particular intent of supporting the intrinsic cmb and sunyaev - zeldovich programs at the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) and other similar observations .",
    "absolute calibration is an especial concern for sunyaev - zeldovich studies since the error in the quantity of interest ( @xmath6 ) is proportional to twice the calibration error .",
    "it is of great importance that the calibrations of intrinsic cmb anisotropy experiments be as accurate as possible in order to place more stringent limits on the parameters of cosmology .",
    "several published cmb experiments use cas a as their primary calibrator , such as the saskatoon experiment ( netterfield et al . , 1996 ) and cat ( scott et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "these experiments typically have calibration uncertainties @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to reduce these uncertainties as much as possible and to use a single flux density scale at or near 32 ghz .",
    "this affects a number of experiments including the ring5 m ( leitch et al . , 1999 ) , mat ( torbet et al .",
    "1999 ; miller et al . 1999 ) , qmap ( devlin et al . , 1998 ) , cbi ( readhead et al . , 1998 ) , dasi ( white et al . , 1998 ) and the vsa ( jones and scott , 1998 ) .",
    "the 1.5-m telescope used in the present observations was originally designed and constructed by jpl as part of the deep space network ( dsn ) program .",
    "the telescope has a parabolic primary reflector with an off - axis secondary and a dual feed horn , and a dicke - switching receiver at the cassegrain focus . to establish absolute gain standards for dsn , the national institute of standards and technology ( nist )",
    "was employed to measure the aperture efficiency of the 1.5-m antenna ; these measurements are discussed in   [ sec : nist ] .",
    "ovro obtained the instrument in 1993 , and our current calibration program commenced in 1996 , with efforts focused on characterizing the receiver and reworking the telescope control code .",
    "most of the useful astronomical observations were taken during the spring of 1998 ( from early march through the end of may ) .",
    "we selected cassiopeia a ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , j2000 ) as our primary calibration source because of its brightness and accessibility from the latitude of the observatory .",
    "observations of other calibrator sources relative to cas a were carried out in the fall of 1998 , as well as during epochs previous to our absolute measurements , allowing the determination of absolute flux densities for these sources as well .    in the following ,",
    "we first present a brief description of the nist calibration measurements (   [ sec : nist ] ) and our own characterization of the instrument (   [ sec : rxcal ] ) ; following this is a summary of observations taken at ovro in the spring of 1998 (   [ sec : obs ] ) , and a detailed discussion of our error budget (   [ sec : syserr ] ) .",
    "next we describe observations of 3c48 , 3c147 , 3c286 , jupiter , mars , saturn and other sources on the ovro 5.5-meter telescope relative to cas a , employing our absolute value for @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "finally we summarize our findings and compare them to the results of other flux density scales (   [ sec : concl ] ) .",
    "flux density , @xmath12 , is related to the spectral power , @xmath13 , by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the _ effective area _ of the telescope .",
    "@xmath16 is always less than the geometrical area of the telescope for a well - designed system due to diffraction at the edge of the dish , surface irregularities , scattering off of the secondary support structure ( not a problem for unblocked apertures such as this one ) , slight impedance mismatches , and so forth .",
    "the most difficult aspect of most absolute flux density measurements at high frequency is the accurate assessment of @xmath16 .",
    "it can be shown from elementary thermodynamic considerations ( e.g. , rohlfs and wilson , 1996 ; krauss , 1986 ) that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the wavelength of the incident radiation and @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the response function of the antenna normalized to one at the maximum . if we define the _ gain",
    "_ , @xmath21 , of a telescope in a given direction as the ratio of @xmath22 in that direction to the mean value of @xmath22 on the sphere , then it can be shown that @xmath23 since @xmath24 is a ratio , it is often expressed in decibels ( dbi , or decibels above the isotropic level implied by the spherical average ) .",
    "it is convenient to express spectral power in terms of the _ antenna temperature _ @xmath25 , defined as the temperature a beam - filling blackbody would need to have ( in the rayleigh - jeans limit ) in order to produce the observed spectral power .",
    "the antenna system may then be characterized by the kelvin per jansky _ sensitivity _ , @xmath26 : @xmath27 numerically , this is @xmath28 in the far - field of a given antenna , these properties ( @xmath26 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) are independent of distance .",
    "the far - field is conventionally defined to be the distance at which the phase variation ( across the aperture of the antenna ) of an electric field originating at a point at distance @xmath31 is less than 22.5@xmath32 ; this criterion yields a beam pattern which is , to a good approximation , independent of the distance of the illuminating source from the antenna . for a flat aperture the given phase constraint results in @xmath33 .",
    "since for many telescopes the far - field is inconveniently far away , the direct measurement of far - field antenna characteristics often requires measurements to be made over long distances outside of a controlled laboratory setting . in this context , boresighting , ground reflections and atmospheric attenuation are all difficult issues to deal with .",
    "extensive work has consequently been done at nist and elsewhere to develop near - field techniques to measure the far - field power pattern and gain of antennas ; this work and the theory behind it is summarized in baird et al .",
    "( 1988 ) lo and lee ( 1993 ) newell et al .",
    "( 1988 ) rahmat - samii ( 1993 ) .",
    "the technique employs a measurement of the near - field electric field of the antenna ; the resulting field distribution ( after correcting for the probe antenna characteristics ) is related to the far - field electric field by a fourier transform .",
    "ranged measurements are used to fit out mutual coupling terms due to imperfect impedance matching between the target and probe antennas ( lo and lee , 1993 ; francis , 1990 ) ; the probe gains themselves are determined using a three - antenna technique ( lo and lee , 1993 ) . in may of 1990 ,",
    "our telescope was characterized at nist s near field test range in boulder , colorado ( nist , 1990 ) .",
    "the compactness of the antenna permitted this procedure to be carried out without disassembling the instrument for shipping , greatly reducing uncertainties which may otherwise arise due to the relative displacement of the various optical components of the system ; for more discussion of this point , see ",
    "[ sec : syserr ] .",
    "nist assigns a @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) systematic error to this measurement in the calibration report ; this uncertainty is dominated by the determination of the probe antenna gain and normalization amplitude . as discussed in   [ sec : rxcal ] , the 1.5-meter is outfitted with a dicke - switching receiver with two horns .",
    "the gains of these horns were separately measured ; we designate them the ant and ref horns .",
    "the nist gains , however , are referred to the _ back _ of the feed horns .",
    "this implies that the stated gains include the effects of ohmic losses in the feeds , whereas our calibration procedure effectively removes these losses .",
    "we will account for this in our final systematic error budet .",
    "l l l l l r @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) & g ( @xmath38 ) & g ( @xmath39 ) & @xmath16 ( @xmath40 ) & @xmath41 & g ( mk / jy ) + 31.8 ( ant ) & @xmath42 & 1.795 & 1.270 & 71.9% & @xmath43 + 32.0 ( ant ) & @xmath44 & 2.014 & 1.407 & 79.6% & @xmath45 + 32.0 ( ref ) & @xmath46 & 1.977 & 1.381 & 78.1% & @xmath47 + 32.3 ( ant ) & @xmath48 & 2.148 & 1.472 & 83.3% & @xmath49 +    the ant beam gain was measured at 31.8 , 32.0 and 32.3 ghz ; the ref beam gain was only measured at 32.0 ghz .",
    "these measurements are summarized in table  [ tbl : nistgain ] .",
    "note that the measured gains at the band edges differ by @xmath50 ; while the nominal receiver bandpass is 3 ghz , it is clear that the extrapolation of the observed gains to 30.5 and 33.5 ghz will introduce a very large uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , the ref beam was only characterized at the band center . for these reasons",
    "an additional filter was introduced into the signal path , reducing our system bandpass to 500 mhz centered on 32.0 ghz ( see   [ sec : rxcal ] ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the mean of the ant and ref beam gains at 32.0 ghz , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 dbi ) , corresponding to @xmath53  sr , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . assuming a geometrical area of @xmath56 , this yields an aperture efficiency of @xmath57 .",
    "the average of the ant and ref gains is the appropriate quantity to use in the context of our double - differenced flux procedure ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "nist also measured the beam patterns of both ant and ref beams ; the beams were found to be well - described by gaussians of @xmath58 fwhm , corresponding to @xmath59 . integrating a gaussian of this width out to the radius of the first measured nulls in the beam pattern ( at @xmath60 ) , we compute @xmath61  sr and a beam efficiency of @xmath62 the beam throw was measured to be @xmath63 , with a @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) elevation offset .",
    "the relatively high beam and aperture efficiencies demonstrate the efficacy of the clear - aperture design and small , stiff primary dish .",
    "it is likely that the 1.8% difference between the ant and the ref gains is due to a slight impedance mismatch on the ref side of the signal chain ; nist measured the return loss on the ref horn to be several db lower than that on the ant horn .",
    "this could be due to differential isolation in the dicke switch .",
    "the receiver is a standard dicke - switching two - horn receiver .",
    "celestial signals enter the receiver via these two scalar feeds ( uncooled ) and pass into the 15 k dewar where right circular polarization is selected .",
    "a cross - guide coupler before the dicke - switch permits the injection of a calibration ( cal ) signal .",
    "the dicke - switch itself operated at 1 khz during observations , providing alternating 0.5 msec `` integrations '' against each feed .",
    "the switched signal is amplified by a hemt ( + 28 db of gain ) , the last component in the 15 k dewar .",
    "the 15 k cryogenic stage displayed remarkable stability from fall 1996 through spring 1998 .",
    "the 15 k dewar is enclosed in a dewar which is maintained at @xmath66 k. on entering this stage , the rf passes first through an avantek amplifier ( second stage , + 22 db ) and then through a double - sideband mixer , which converts the signal down to a 0 to 1.5 ghz if . before leaving the dewar , the if is amplified and passed through a 1.5 ghz low - pass filter .",
    "this signal is piped via coaxial cable to a climate - controlled trailer where the detection and post - detection signal processing is carried out . for the reasons detailed in   [ sec : nist ] , detection of the full band power is undesirable , so this signal was passed through a 250 mhz low - pass filter , giving a system bandpass of 500 mhz on the sky ; the resulting signal is split , half going to a diode detector , which feeds a lock - in - amplifier ( lia ) for the detection of switched power , and half going to an hp 437b power meter for detection of total power . in order to boost the if signal well above the lowest levels that the lia was capable of detecting , another if amplifier ( + 17 db of gain ) was inserted in the signal chain after the coaxial cable and before the final low - pass filter .",
    "the linearities of the power meter power head and diode detector were assessed by measuring the cal signal increment with an ambient - temperature microwave absorber placed in front of the feed - horns and varying the attenuation prior to the powerhead and detector .",
    "the diode detector s departures from linearity over the dynamic range encountered in calibration observations is less than @xmath67 ; the power head s deviation is less than @xmath68 .",
    "these elements are thus not significant sources of nonlinearity .",
    "the receiver on the other hand is somewhat nonlinear , which is discussed below .",
    "the dicke switch isolation was measured by locking the switch onto the ant feed while repeatedly firing the cal signal into the ref feed . in 112 pairs of on / off averages of the system power , a mean fractional increase in the system temperature of @xmath69 was observed .",
    "these tests were conducted against an external cold load for stability ; assuming @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see below ) , this implies a leakage of @xmath72 of the cal signal .",
    "this is equivalent to an isolation of @xmath73 db .",
    "any effects such as losses or a finite duty cycle in the dicke switch do not affect our results as they will affect celestial observations and observations of our calibration loads in the same fashion ( see below ) .",
    "although the receiver design incorporates several mechanical waveguide switches which permit some degree of control over the magnitude of the cal diode signal , these switches were not exercised _ at any point _ during or between our calibration measurements and observations .",
    "this precaution was deemed necessary due to the possibility that the switches might not toggle between two precisely defined impedance states , which would cause the apparent cal signal brightness to change .",
    "the receiver does not have any variable attenuators , which would have to be calibrated at a number of settings .    although the nist calibration allows the accurate computation of flux densities given @xmath25 ,",
    "the task of determining @xmath25 from observed quantities ( millivolts ) is not trivial .",
    "this issue is more important in the context of an absolute measurement , since for experiments which use an external flux density reference the sensitivity ( k / jy ) and the receiver gain ( mv / k ) are not determined independently : the overall gain ( mv / jy , or some equivalent quantity ) is obtained directly .",
    "consequently , great care was taken in designing a power ( @xmath25 ) calibration scheme .",
    "this task is made somewhat easier by the fact that we measure the antenna temperature in units of the cal signal , whose derived magnitude is not highly sensitive to slight errors in our brightness temperature references ( two microwave absorbers at known thermodynamic temperatures see   [ sec : syserr ] , and below ) .    to measure the receiver temperature @xmath74 of our system and the effective brightness temperature @xmath75 of our cal signal , we use the standard hot - cold load scheme .",
    "our hot load is an ambient temperature microwave absorber and our cold load is an absorber immersed in liquid nitrogen .",
    "the increment in total power is measured against each of these loads providing a measurement of @xmath75 , @xmath74 and the receiver nonlinearity .",
    "the loads themselves are our ultimate temperature references . in terms of the temperatures of the hot and cold loads , the receiver temperature @xmath74 is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the observed ratio of total power against the hot load to total power against the cold load .",
    "once @xmath74 is known , the effective brightness temperature of the cal diode may be determined by observing the total power against either of the hot or cold loads with the cal diode on and off . for observations against the cold load ,",
    "we find @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the ratio of the total power observed with the cal diode on to total power observed with the cal diode off .",
    "if @xmath75 is derived from observations against the hot load , we find @xmath80 since observations at lower power levels are less affected by increased system noise and nonlinearity ( see below ) , we derive @xmath75 from observations against the cold load .",
    "the microwave absorber employed for each load was a 3-inch thick sheet of eccosorb cv .",
    "tests at liquid nitrogen temperature indicate that the absorber had an optical depth @xmath81 . at ambient temperatures ,",
    "the optical depth is expected to be higher ( hemmati , 1985 ) , but this measurement is more difficult due to the increased system noise .",
    "the cold load was assumed to have a thermodynamic temperature equal to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen ( 76.3 k at atmospheric pressures characteristic of the owens valley ) .",
    "the front - face temperature of the hot load was measured with a hand - held infrared thermometer ; this thermometer was calibrated ( using eccosorb - cv ) against a platinum resistance thermometer with a specified accuracy at room temperature of @xmath82 . while in principle this calibration may have been necessary to relate the thermodynamic temperature to the effective infrared brightness temperature over the ir thermometer s bandpass ( i.e. , to correct for the unknown and presumably finite ir emissivity of eccosorb - cv ) we found that both thermometers measured the same temperatures to @xmath83 . assuming that @xmath84 for our absorber , the thermodynamic and brightness temperatures for both loads are identical to better than @xmath85",
    "given our measured optical depth , temperature gradients across the hot load do not significantly affect our measurements provided we measure the temperature of the front face of the absorber .",
    "the manufacturer s specifications indicate that reflections from the absorber at 32 ghz are suppressed by 50 db .",
    "the cold load cooler is constructed of a cross - linked polyethylene foam , which possesses good thermal properties and has a very low optical depth at microwave frequencies ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "laboratory measurements of the cooler show that it evinces a brightness temperature @xmath87 k higher than a cone of absorber dipped in liquid nitrogen .",
    "this measured brightness temperature excess is also consistent with the expected brightness temperature of a 300 k emitter with an optical depth of @xmath88 .",
    "we correct the cold load brightness temperature for this emission . in spite of the simplicity of the cone - load arrangement , these loads were not used for daily @xmath74 and @xmath75 measurements due to their lack of long - term emission stability .",
    "one potential concern which arises in the usage of a liquid - nitrogen - filled cooler is the impedance mismatch at the box - nitrogen interface ; if there is significant power being emitted out of the horns ( presumably of order @xmath74 ) , then some fraction of this power would be reflected back into the system , artificially increasing the measured receiver temperature .",
    "to the end of calibrating the first ovro sze experiment , herbig et al .",
    "( 1994 ) constructed a cold load box of the same cross - linked polyethelyene foam with an impedance - matching network on one side .",
    "this network consisted of a hexagonal pattern of ( liquid - nitrogen - filled ) holes on the inside of the cooler wall which provides a refractive index intermediate to that between free space and liquid nitrogen .",
    "no significant difference in power was observed between the matched and unmatched sides of the cold load .",
    "this together with the good agreement between the measured and theoretically computed box emission , show that neither internal reflections nor other excess emission mechanisms contribute significantly to our cold load measurement . for a more detailed discussion on the effects of excess emission on our @xmath89 calibration , see ",
    "[ sec : syserr ] .    in the taking of @xmath74 measurements ,",
    "a @xmath90 receiver nonlinearity is seen ( a compression of the cal signal at the hot load total power levels relative to what is seen at cold load power levels ) .",
    "most likely this is due to a slight compression of the second or third stage amplifiers .",
    "we correct our measurements for nonlinearity by assuming that our system response @xmath91 to an input power @xmath92 is described by @xmath93 where @xmath24 is the receiver gain and @xmath94 characterizes the nonlinearity in the system . for small excursions from perfect linearity",
    "as observed this should be a good description .",
    "this is the same description employed by leitch et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with good results on the ovro 5.5-m ka - band system , as well as the 40-m ku - band system .",
    "we measure @xmath94 on an observation - by - observation basis by equating the cal signal increments observed against the hot and cold loads and solving for @xmath94 .",
    "it is not significant to quote a mean value for @xmath94 since this depends on @xmath24 at the time of the observation which is significantly time variable .",
    "application of this correction to each data point reduced the mean @xmath75 by @xmath95 , and @xmath74 by @xmath96 .    to measure the effectiveness of a nonlinearity correction based on eq .",
    "[ eq : tpnl ] , it is convenient to compare the cal diode increments observed against hot and cold loads to the increment observed against the sky at zenith . for all the data taken in the 14 @xmath97measurements , prior to the application of the nonlinearity correction the ratios of the raw cal increment observed against the hot load to the raw cal increment observed at zenith , and",
    "the equivalent quantity for the cold load , are @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "after the application of a nonlinearity correction derived separately for each observation , this ratio ( for both loads ) is @xmath100 . since no information about the cal signal increment at zenith was employed in the derivation of @xmath94 , this is an independent indication that our simple model is a good description of the system non - linearity over the whole range of powers relevant to our observations .    using this arrangement we measured @xmath74 and @xmath75 on 14 separate occasions during the period 10 may 1998 through 15 may 1998 ;",
    "after correcting for receiver nonlinearity and the dicke - switch isolation , as well as applying a slight correction for deviations from the rayleigh - jeans law , we find @xmath101 k and @xmath102 k ( measurement error only ) .",
    "the radiometry procedures used in observations on the 1.5-m telescope are the same as those used on the other single - dish radio telescopes at ovro .",
    "the two fundamental procedures are flux and cal measurements .",
    "a flux measurement is a double switched measurement in which the source is alternately placed in the ref and ant beams ; two integrations of switched power are executed in each position .",
    "this cancels out constant and linear power backgrounds in the measurement , such as those caused by the atmosphere , receiver noise and ground pickup .",
    "a cal procedure consists of two integrations of switched power with the cal diode signal being injected into one of the receiver arms , bracketed by two integrations of switched power with the cal signal off . for more detail on these procedures",
    "refer to readhead et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , myers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and leitch et al .",
    "it is additionally possible to record ( singly ) switched power ; this procedure is known as an average . by doing a set of averages around the nominal pointing center of some source , it is possible to derive the pointing offsets ; this is known as a point procedure .",
    "generally four averages were done spaced at @xmath103 in azimuth and elevation around the source .    in march 1998",
    "two days of pointing data were taken on bright celestial sources ( cas a , the crab and venus ) .",
    "these observations consisted of a cycle of point , flux , and cal procedures executed repeatedly against the source in long tracks . from these data a pointing model was derived which reduced the rms pointing offset from 15.4 to 2.2 ( 0.85 on cas a ) in addition to removing overall systematic pointing offsets .",
    "this is the pointing model which was used in subsequent observations . due to the weather conditions in may reliable pointing tests",
    "were not possible , but for a small stiff dish such as this that presents no problem , as all of the pointing errors are likely to be constant offsets .    on 22 april 1998 , observations of cas",
    "a consisting of alternate pointings on the ant and ref beam positions were taken in order to confirm the nist - measured beamthrow .",
    "we found , relative to these fixed offsets , an azimuth separation of @xmath104 , and a zenith angle separation of @xmath105 .",
    "we take this to be consistent with the nominal @xmath106 offsets .",
    "given our 25.8 fwhm main beam , the neglect of the 0.7 ant / ref zenith angle offset amounts to a potential @xmath107 systematic error in our flux measurements .    during the period 10 may 1998  16 may 1998 , observations of cas a were conducted when the weather permitted .",
    "these observations consisted of fluxes ( 10 second integrations in each segment , with 15 second idle times to allow the telescope to acquire the position ) interleaved at 10 minute intervals with cal s ( 10 second integrations , 5 second idles ) . the pointing model described above was employed .",
    "full tracks on the source were used in order to average out variations in atmospheric opacity or residual ground spillover over the course of a track .",
    "the data were calibrated by scaling the observed fluxes by the ratio of observed cal s to the measured cal diode temperature ( @xmath108 ) . since the cal and flux measurements were taken at the the same power level no nonlinearity correction is necessary . if the standard deviation of any individual cal or flux procedure is more than four times the average standard deviation observed in the entire data set , that datum is rejected .",
    "similar @xmath109 edits were performed on the cal and flux means .",
    "these edits remove a negligible fraction of the data but eliminate grossly discrepant data points caused by atmospheric interference or rare instrumental glitches .",
    "since the atmosphere has a significant opacity to microwave radiation , it is necessary to apply a correction for atmospheric attenuation .",
    "the observed flux density of a source as a function of zenith angle is @xmath110 at 32 ghz , the optical depth @xmath111 is typically less than @xmath112 when observations are conducted .",
    "opacity corrections were determined by a straight - line fit of the natural logarithm source flux densities to sec(za ) , and the data multiplied by @xmath113 .",
    "data at @xmath114 were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the 10 may 1998 - 16 may 1998 data set as a whole has a mean optical depth @xmath115 .",
    "figure  [ fig : castau ] shows the raw flux data uncalibrated for atmospheric attenuation .",
    "the straight - line fit in this figure corresponds to @xmath115 .",
    "the weighted mean of the calibrated data yields @xmath116 jy ( measurement error only ) .",
    "the fully calibrated data are plotted versus za in figure  [ fig : casflux ] .",
    "the solid line shows the mean for all of the fluxes , and the dashed lines show our @xmath117 error bars ( see   [ sec : syserr ] ) . for clarity",
    ", the data have been binned into 100 equal bins in za .",
    "these data show evidence for some contamination at the @xmath118 jy level ; this is likely due to ground spillover which was not entirely eliminated by our double - differencing .",
    "an effect of similar magnitude is seen in the data plotted against parallactic angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : caspaflux ] ) .",
    "exclusion of the data at @xmath119 ( data of notably lower quality ) leaves the mean unaffected to @xmath120 .",
    "the overall gradient in the fluxes as a function of parallactic angle is well - correlated with ambient temperature and we therefore suspect that it is due to imperfect temperature control of the cal diode ; this was confirmed in calibration observations taken in october and december of 1998 .",
    "since the @xmath75 measurements themselves were taken at a wide range of ambient temperatures , this is not likely to bias our result .",
    "the fact that the the fluxes as a function of za are roughly consistent with a constant value ( @xmath121 for 89 degrees of freedom ) is an indication that the parallactic angle variations average out over the course of a track . in any case",
    "both of these effects are well within our calculated @xmath117 systematic error limits , which we describe in the next section .",
    "in this section we present our estimate of the contributions of various systematic effects to our measurement .",
    "we consider these effects in order of their importance .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty for our measurement is the nist gain measurement error ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "short of recalibrating the telescope , there is little that can be done to reduce this . due to the differing reference planes of the nist gain measurement and our hot / cold load calibration",
    "( see   [ sec : nist ] ) , there is an additional uncertainty which we estimate to be about 1% due to ohmic losses in the feeds .",
    "this would have the effect of making the nist gain artificially low , hence affects our inferred flux density only in the negative direction .",
    "based on the rms of the fluxes derived from individual days observations we estimate that @xmath111 contributes no more than a @xmath123 potential error to our measurement .    since the observed ground spillover and @xmath75 effects noted in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] will average out to some extent over a track ( and as @xmath75 measurements are taken at different ambient temperatures ) , we take these to contribute independent systematic errors at the level of half the observed maximum departure from the mean . since the observed fluctuations are @xmath118 jy in each case , this results in two contributions of @xmath124 to our systematic error budget .    since cas a is located very close to the galactic plane ( @xmath125 )",
    ", there is the possibility that our measurements are contaminated by foreground sources , such as bright hii regions associated with young stellar systems , as well as by flat spectrum background radio galaxies present at all galactic latitudes .",
    "unfortunately cas a is the second brightest extrasolar source in the sky at our observing frequency , with the consequence that radio surveys of this region of the sky tend to be heavily contaminated due to the telescope sidelobes ; on the other hand , the high overall flux density of cas a reduces the fractional significance of interloping sources .",
    "the primary concern for observations with our dual - feed system is that a contaminating point source may pass through the scan pattern of one of the reference beams .",
    "since the reference beams move on the sky relative to the nominal pointing center ( cas a ) , such an event introduces a characteristic hour angle dependence into our data .",
    "based on the data that we have collected , we place an upper limit of 16 jy on the magnitude of possible point source contamination in the reference beams",
    ". we should indicate that while some of the individual features in figure  [ fig : caspaflux ] are consistent with the signature of a single point source , all of them _ jointly _ are not .",
    "in particular , the feature centered at @xmath126 is consistent with a contaminating point source of about 16 jy , but the double feature ( including the feature centered at @xmath127 ) is _ not _ well represented by two point sources .",
    "we conclude therefore that most of the signal observed is residual ground spillover . using a model which realistically accounts for the motion of the reference beams during a scan",
    ", a 16 jy source placed at the _ center _ of one of our reference beams would bias the average flux density we infer for cas a by @xmath128 jy ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "we adopt this as a @xmath35 upper limit on possible point source confusion . since there are only a handful of sources in the whole sky at 32 ghz with flux densities greater than a few jy",
    ", this is likely to overestimate the level of point source contamination .",
    "the accuracy of our pointing algorithm was determined using a monte - carlo simulation with realistic signal - to - noise statistics .",
    "the pointing error is dominated by the model residuals , which could be improved by more pointing in good weather .",
    "the overall pointing error is estimated to contribute a @xmath130 systematic error to our result , of which @xmath131 comes from the pointing model residuals .    while determining the cal diode brightness temperature , @xmath75 , is one of the most crucial aspects of our experiment ,",
    "we have been able to do so very precisely , so this error is one of the least significant contributors to our error budget .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that @xmath75 is relatively insensitive to errors in the load temperatures . using equation  [ eq : tcalcold ] , which takes into account the implicit load - temperature dependence of our system temperature determination",
    ", we find that the error in @xmath75 induced by an error in the expected cold load temperature @xmath132 is @xmath133 and the corresponding error due to the hot load is @xmath134 with the observed vales of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , this yields about @xmath137 of error in @xmath75 per degree k of error in either of the hot or cold loads .",
    "adopting @xmath138 and @xmath139 and adding these errors in quadrature , we obtain a @xmath131 error in @xmath75 .",
    "even though there is a fairly significant nonlinearity in our receiver system , it affects our @xmath89 calibration at only the @xmath95 level and so even relatively larger errors in the characterization of the nonlinearity affect us at @xmath140 level .",
    "systematic errors in @xmath141 or @xmath132 do not significantly affect this characterization since the nonlinearity measurements depend only on the observed cal signal _ increment _ against each of these loads .    in general the gain and source spectrum may vary across the band , and this may be a significant source of error for observations with a wide bandpass . for a source with a flux density",
    "@xmath142 observed on a system with a frequency - dependent effective area @xmath143 , the band - averaged spectral power is @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the band center and @xmath146 the total bandpass .",
    "if both @xmath143 and @xmath142 can be reasonably approximated as power laws over this interval , then the band - averaged spectral power can be shown to be @xmath147 variations in these quantities thus induce errors proportional to the fractional bandpass @xmath148 squared in the flux densities and brightness temperatures one infers under the assumption that one is measuring @xmath149 instead of the band averaged flux density . for our narrow ( @xmath150 )",
    "bandpass , this introduces errors at less than the @xmath151 level and may be safely neglected .",
    "another potential concern for very accurate measurements made with dual - feed systems is that the sidelobes of one beam will be present at a significant level in the other beam , reducing the average gain of a doubly - switched measurement .",
    "since the secondary is illuminated asymmetrically , the sidelobes of one beam in the direction of the other tend to be highly suppressed .",
    "the nist measurements indicate that the sidelobes of one beam are suppressed by @xmath152 db near the maximum of the other beam ( nist , 1990 ) ; in contrast , the nearest sidelobes on the other side are at @xmath153 db . this is therefore not a concern for our system .",

    "we compute effective spectral indices over the 5.5-meter bandpass from the spectral fitting formulae given by ( kellermann et al .",

    "the spectra of these structures are generally well described by power laws with @xmath183 , up to and including the 83 @xmath37data . since a single dish radio telescope is likely to measure slightly different spectral indices due to the dependence of the spectral indices on spatial scale , we take this as merely suggestive , and adopt the value of @xmath184 computed above to interpolate our 5.5-meter measurements onto 32.0 ghz flux densities for all of our sources .",
