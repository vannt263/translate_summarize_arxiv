    "the observation of many star - forming regions has shown that stars form in molecular cloud cores .",
    "a star is born after a long journey through the gravitational collapse of a cloud core .",
    "the gas begins to collapse in a dense part of the cloud ( i.e. , the cloud core ) and increases its density and temperature as the cloud core collapses further .",
    "when the collapsing gas reaches a sufficiently high density ( @xmath1 ) , the collapse stops and a protostar having almost a jovian mass is born @xcite .",
    "then , the protostar increases its mass through mass accretion and finally evolves into a main - sequence star ( or main - sequence phase ) .",
    "the star formation process can be divided into two phases : the early protostellar collapse phase and later accretion phase of the star formation .",
    "the early phase , also called the gas collapsing phase , is defined as the period before protostar formation after gas collapse is initiated in the cloud core .",
    "thus , during this phase , the gas continues to collapse . on the other hand ,",
    "the later phase is defined as the period before the main - sequence phase after the gas collapse stops and a protostar appears in the collapsing cloud core . in particular , during the later phase , the period when the protostar significantly increases its mass by mass accretion is called `` the main accretion phase . ''",
    "since the star acquires almost all its mass in this main accretion phase , the final stellar mass is determined in this phase .",
    "protostars during the main accretion phase are observed ( or defined ) as class 0 or i objects by spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the observation of star - forming regions also has shown that almost all class 0 or i objects drive a protostellar outflow . because a certain fraction of mass and angular momentum are ejected by the protostellar outflows , they are closely related to the rate of mass accretion onto the protostar and final stellar mass . moreover , the infalling gas with an angular momentum forms the circumstellar disk during the main accretion phase .",
    "the evolution of the circumstellar disk is related to the mass accretion and outflow rates .",
    "in addition , the circumstellar disk is the site of planet formation . therefore , understanding the evolution of the circumstellar disk during the main accretion phase is essential to understanding both the star and planet formation processes .    since the protostar and circumstellar disk during the main accretion phase are veiled by the infalling envelope , it is difficult to observe them .",
    "recently , however , the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( sst ) has been unveiling this phase .",
    "@xcite discovered a massive circumstellar disk of @xmath2 comparable to a central protostar around a class 0 object , indicating that ( i ) the disk already exists in the main accretion phase , and ( ii ) the disk mass is significantly larger than the theoretical prediction .",
    "@xcite observed several star forming regions and identified several class 0 objects using the sst .",
    "they showed that the bolometric luminosity of the objects is considerably dimmer than classical theoretical predictions , and has a dispersion over 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "they pointed out that recent observations aggravate the `` luminosity problem '' ( the problem that the accretion luminosity of protostars is lower than theoretical predictions , see @xcite ) , and concluded that non - steady accretion is inevitably required to explain the observational results .",
    "the non - steady accretion may be attainable when the circumstellar disk is sufficiently massive and causes the gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "another recent development in observation of star and planet formation is direct images of exo - planets @xcite , in which planets are located at @xmath3au from the central star .",
    "however , in the framework of the core accretion scenario @xcite , there is less likehood of planets forming in a region that is so remote from the central star .",
    "alternatively , the gravitational instability scenario @xcite may explain the formation of such planets . in summary ,",
    "recent observations seem to indicate that the protostars have a considerably massive disk unlike what was previously believed .",
    "although it seems that recent observational progress is unveiling problems for the early evolution stage of star formation , we can not directly observe the circumstellar disk and protostar in the main accretion phase because they are embedded in the dense infalling envelope .",
    "thus , theoretical study is necessary to understand the properties of the circumstellar disk and protostar . in particular , multi - dimensional simulations are necessary to investigate the evolution of the circumstellar disk , protostellar outflow , and so on .",
    "the evolution of the collapsing gas cloud core from the protostellar core stage ( i.e. , the gas collapsing phase ) until protostar formation has been well investigated using multi - dimensional simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , only a few studies have focused on the main accretion phase immediately following the prestellar core stage , because it is difficult to calculate long - term evolution in the main accretion phase with sufficient spatial resolution . in unmagnetized cloud cores , the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk in the main accretion phase through the gas collapsing phase were investigated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they found that the circumstellar disk is considerably massive to induce fragmentation or the gravitational instability that is related to a non - steady accretion flow onto the protostar .    in reality , however , since molecular clouds are strongly magnetized @xcite , the magnetic field may play an important role in the evolution of the circumstellar disk during the main accretion phase .",
    "@xcite investigated the evolution in two dimensions of the circumstellar disk in a magnetized cloud core and showed the non - steady accretion onto the central protostar . in three dimensions ,",
    "the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk from prestellar core stage were investigated only by @xcite , in which they showed fragmentation and possible planet formation in the magnetically inactive region of the circumstellar disk during the main accretion phase .",
    "they also indicated non - steady mass accretion onto the protostar owing to the gravitational instability of the circumstellar disk .",
    "however , this study only calculated the evolution of the circumstellar disk about @xmath4yr after protostar formation .    in this study , in a setting similar to @xcite , we investigate the evolution of the circumstellar disk for @xmath5yr , which is @xmath6 times longer than the previous study .",
    "in addition to the model adopted by @xcite , we newly calculate the evolution of the circumstellar disk formed in a relatively stable initial cloud core . in both models , we compare the mass accretion rate , properties of protostellar outflow , and the fragmentation condition . the structure of the paper is as follows .",

    "note that although the protostellar outflow driven by the circumstellar disk propagates into the region of @xmath24 and disturbs the interstellar medium over time , we can safely calculate the mass accretion process onto the circumstellar disk because the outflow propagating into the interstellar medium does not affect the inner cloud core region ( @xmath30 ) . in this study",

    "the calculation is first performed with five grid levels ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "we calculated the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk in magnetized collapsing cloud cores .",
    "first , we simply outline the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk . before protostar formation ,",
    "the first ( adiabatic ) core forms in the collapsing cloud core with a scale of @xmath6au @xcite . at its formation",
    ", the first core has a thick disk - like structure and is mainly supported by the thermal pressure gradient force .",
    "after protostar formation , the first core becomes thin because the centrifugal force dominates the thermal pressure gradient force @xcite . during the main accretion phase ,",
    "the first core grows and extends to a large extent ( @xmath97au ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that the circumstellar disk originates from the first core , and is formed before protostar formation ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the formation of the first core ( or the circumstellar disk ) before protostar formation has been investigated in many past studies ( see review by * ? ? ?",

    "thus , in the collapsing cloud core , the protostar for model a03 forms for a shorter duration than that for model a05 .",
    "this is because the initial cloud core for model a03 is more unstable than that for model a05 and begins to collapse according to the self - similar solution @xcite in a shorter time after the calculation begins @xcite . in both models , we calculated the evolution of the circumstellar disk for @xmath100yr after protostar formation .",

    ", the outflow driven by the circumstellar disk extends up to @xmath107516au by the end of the calculation .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:2 ] , the outflow is driven only by the outer disk region , while the outflow is not driven by the inner region of the circumstellar disk where fragmentation occurs and planets appear .",
    "this is because the inner disk region has a density of @xmath112 and the magnetic field is dissipated by ohmic dissipation . as shown in @xcite and @xcite , when the number density exceeds @xmath113 , ohmic dissipation becomes effective owing to the extremely low ionization degree .",
    "note that the ambipolar diffusion can be effective in the range of @xmath114 ( see ,  [ sec : ambipolar ] ) .",
    "fragmentation is suppressed by the magnetic field because magnetic effects such as magnetic braking and outflows effectively transfer the angular momentum that promotes fragmentation @xcite .",
    "thus , a weaker field promotes fragmentation in the circumstellar disk . as a result",
    ", the inner disk region has a considerable weak magnetic field and fragmentation occurs without outflow , while the outer disk region has a strong field and no fragmentation occurs with outflow .    in figure  [ fig:2 ] ,",
    "yellow lines are magnetic field lines . in the figure , only magnetic field lines that threaded planets are plotted to stress the planet s spin or orbital motion .",
    "the magnetic field lines just above each planet are strongly twisted by the spin motion of the planet . in the midair ( or on a large scale ) , the magnetic field lines originating from each planet are twisted together , reflecting the orbital motion of the planets .",
    "although we only plotted magnetic field lines near the planet to understand the planet s motion , the magnetic field ( or lorentz force ) in this region ( or inner disk region ) is extremely weak ( @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the plasma beta and different from initial ratio of the rotational to the gravitational energy , @xmath53 ) because ohmic dissipation is effective .",
    "thus , near the planets , the magnetic field lines are passively moved , and they hardly affect the dynamical evolution of both the planet and circumstellar disk .",

    "is significantly dissipated by the ohmic dissipation in the inner disk region ( @xmath142au ) , because the density in such a region exceeds @xmath104 .",
    "thus , in the inner disk region , the angular momentum transfer by the magnetic field is not effective , and the excess angular momentum and accumulated mass cause the gravitational instability to induce the non - axisymmetric structure @xcite .",
    "however , since the increase rate of the disk mass for model a03 is considerably smaller than that for model a05 ( see ,  [ sec : mass1 ] ) , the circumstellar disk for model a05 is not sufficiently massive to induce fragmentation ( see ,  [ sec : property ] ) . for model a05 , fragmentation and formation of substellar - mass object do not occur until the end of the calculation . as a result ,",

    "the difference in protostellar mass is caused by the difference in the rate of mass accretion onto the protostar .",
    "the different mass accretion rates are owing to different efficiencies of the angular momentum transfer in the circumstellar disk .",
    "the higher rate of mass accretion onto the protostar is realized in a more massive circumstellar disk , because a massive disk tends to show gravitational instability that effectively transfers the angular momentum outward , and increases the rate of mass accretion onto the protostar .",

    ". when planets or substellar - mass objects appear in the circumstellar disk , they can affect the rate of accretion onto the protostar . as described in  [ sec : mdot ] , we may verify their existence by observing the time - variability of the rate of accretion onto the central protostar .",

    "the figure indicates that the orbital motion of planets or substellar - mass objects clearly synchronizes with the mass accretion rate .",
    "the orbiting objects disturb the circumstellar disk and promote mass accretion onto the protostar . since the circumstellar disk has a higher density and shorter timescale in the proximity of the protostar , a high mass accretion rate is realized when the planets or substellar - mass objects approach the protostar . as a result , the mass accretion rate is closely related to the orbital motion of planets and substellar - mass objects .",
    "we may estimate and verify the orbital motion of planets in the circumstellar disk by observing the time - variable mass accretion .",
    "note that we ignored the effect of the infalling envelope when the accretion luminosity is estimated in figure  [ fig:13 ] .",
    "note also that , to quantitatively estimate the accretion luminosity , we have to consider the infalling envelope that weakens the luminosity from the protostar .      in this study",

    "the magnetic field suppresses fragmentation while the rotation promotes it .",

    "moreover , even in a cloud core with a very weak magnetic field , fragmentation in the circumstellar disk may be suppressed by the global spiral structure that effectively transports the angular momentum and lowers the surface density ( i.e. , increases the toomre @xmath175-parameter ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the circumstellar disk is strongly magnetized , the angular momentum is transferred by magnetic effects and the spiral structure hardly develops .",
    "then , the mass accumulates in the inner disk region where ohmic dissipation significantly weakens the magnetic field , and fragmentation can occur because no global spiral structure develops .",
    "thus , magnetic field and rotation contribute to both promotion and suppression of fragmentation through a complicated process . in this study",
    ", we showed the possibility of fragmentation in the main accretion phase .",

    "the barotropic approximation makes it possible to calculate very long - term evolution of the circumstellar disk and to investigate the evolution of the circumstellar disk by the end of the main accretion phase from the prestellar core stage , while radiation hydrodynamic calculations are necessary to qualitatively estimate the fragment mass .",
    "in addition , after fragmentation occurs in the circumstellar disk , we need a higher spatial resolution to investigate the acquisition process of the fragments mass .",
    "recent works about a gas giant planet formation showed that the hill radius of the protoplanet should be resolved with sufficient spatial resolution for accurate estimate the rate of mass accretion onto the protoplanet @xcite .",
    "note that in these calculations , the protoplanet mass was fixed , and the evolution of the circumstellar disk was calculated with a high spatial resolution for a shorter duration after a gas - giant formed .",
    "the hill radius is expressed as @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the orbital radius of the planet .",
    "when the protoplanet orbiting the solar - mass protostar has a mass of @xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) and is located at @xmath257au ( 10au ) , the hill radius is @xmath258au ( @xmath259au ) .",
    "when the hill radius is resolved with @xmath260 cells , we need a minimum spatial resolution ( i.e. , the size of each cell ) of @xmath261au ( @xmath262au ) .",
    "however , calculation with such high resolution needs much computing power , and thus we only calculated the evolution of the circumstellar disk for a very short duration . in reality , the evolution of the circumstellar disk was calculated for only @xmath4yr at best in previous studies , while we calculated the evolution of the circumstellar disk from prestellar core stage until @xmath100yr after protostar formation .",
    "the final mass of fragments is important to determine whether they are planets or binary companions . to understand both formation and evolution of ( gas - giant ) planets , we need to calculate the evolution of the circumstellar disk for a longer duration with higher spatial resolution",
    "however , such calculations are impossible even using present supercomputers because a longer temporal calculation conflicts with higher spatial resolution .",
    "thus , in this study , we covered the whole prestellar cloud core and investigated the evolution of the circumstellar disk with moderately coarser spatial resolution @xmath263au , and showed that fragmentation occurs in the circumstellar disk and a planet or substellar - mass object forms .",
    "however , since we need a higher spatial resolution to determine the final mass of the fragment , we did not investigate this point in greater depth . in this study",

    "as described in  [ sec : property ] , the recurrent planet formation and intermittent outflow shown in this paper are closely related to the effect of magnetic field and its dissipation in the circumstellar disk .",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] shows that the magnetic field is well - coupled with the neutral gas in the outer disk region ( @xmath264au ) where a relatively high ionization rate is realized owing to a relatively low gas density .",
    "thus , the angular momentum in such region is effectively transferred by the magnetic braking and protostellar outflow , and the gas can flow into the inner disk region . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic field is not well - coupled with the neutral gas in the inner disk region ( @xmath265au ) where the gas density is high and a considerably low ionization rate is realized .",
    "thus , the angular momentum transfer due to the magnetic effects is not so effective , and the gas flowing from the outer disk region accumulates in the inner disk region around the boundary between the magnetically active and inactive region at @xmath266au ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] ) . in that region",
    ", the surface density continues to increase and fragmentation tends to occur . in summary ,",
    "magnetic dissipation is essential in inducing recurrent fragmentation ( or planet formation ) in the circumstellar disk .    in this study , we have considered only ohmic dissipation as the dissipation mechanism of the magnetic field .",
    "this is because ohmic dissipation is expected to be the most effective mechanism for magnetic field dissipation in high density region where most of the magnetic flux leakage occurs .",
    "however , ambipolar diffusion may also contribute to the magnetic flux leakage in some intermediate density region .",
    "recent studies have shown that the ohmic dissipation is more effective than the ambipolar diffusion in the range of @xmath267 , while the ambipolar diffusion dominates in the range of @xmath268 @xcite . in the range of @xmath144",
    "the magnetic field is well - coupled with the neutral gas in a magnetically super critical cloud @xcite .",
    "thus , it might be important to study how the inclusion of ambipolar diffusion would change the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk , through the possible contribution in the limited range of density . with strong coupling approximation ,",
    "the induction equation including the ambipolar diffusion can be written as @xmath269 \\right ] , \\label{eq : ambipolar}\\ ] ] where @xmath270 , @xmath271 and @xmath272 are the density of neutral gas and charged particles and a drag coefficient between charged particles and neutrals , respectively ( for details , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the third term of equation  ( [ eq : ambipolar ] ) can be regarded as a non - linear diffusion term by the ambipolar diffusion .",
    "when we adopt an approximate relation between neutral and charged particle density , @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is a constant , the effective diffusion coefficient of the ambipolar diffusion ( @xmath275 ) can be roughly estimated as @xmath276 in a realistic setting , @xcite showed that diffusion coefficient of the ambipolar diffusion ( @xmath275 ) is 10 - 100 times larger than that of the ohmic dissipation ( @xmath12 ) in the range of @xmath277 . strictly speaking , to include the effect of the ambipolar diffusion , we should solve equation  ( [ eq : ambipolar ] ) together with the equations determining charged particle density .",
    "note that the realistic evolution of charged particle density sensitively depends on total surface area of dust grains , since the recombination of charged particles on the grain surface is very efficient .",
    "however , there is a considerable uncertainty in the evolution of dust grain properties , such as the size distribution , in the protostellar collapse process .",
    "thus , our limited knowledge of grain properties make our accurate treatment of magnetic field dissipation impracticable .",
    "this is also the reason why we adopted parametric description of the ohmic diffusion coefficient in our study of magnetic field dissipation @xcite . in this paper",

    ", we constructed a non - rotating bonner - ebert sphere with a central density of @xmath281 immersed in the uniform magnetic field of @xmath282 g .",
    "then , we calculated the collapse of this cloud with different @xmath283 .",
    "figure  [ fig:15 ] shows the evolution of the magnetic field as a function of the central number density .",
    "the magnetic field in each model tracks the same path in the range of @xmath284 , while the magnetic field for model with @xmath285 begins to depart from that for ideal mhd model ( @xmath286 ) at @xmath287 .",
    "the figure indicates that non - ideal mhd effect becomes important at the lower density with the larger @xmath283 .",
    "when the central number density reaches @xmath288 , the magnetic field strengths for model with @xmath286 and @xmath289 are @xmath290 g and @xmath291 g , respectively .",
    "thus , the ideal mhd model has about 100 times stronger magnetic field than model with @xmath292 at this epoch . at the same epoch ,",

    "thus , the difference of the magnetic field strength between @xmath293 and @xmath289 ( 10 ) is only factor of 6 ( 2 ) .",
    "next , we calculated the evolution of the circumstellar disk with the initial condition same as model a03 but different resistivities @xmath286 , 10 and 100 .",

    ", the circumstellar disk also shows fragmentation and subsequent planet formation . note that we have terminated the calculation with larger resistivity earlier , since it takes formidable time to follow the evolution with larger resistivity with our time - explicit integration scheme for diffusion term @xcite .",
    "thus , we can not directly compare the results among models with different resistivities .",
    "however , figure  [ fig:16 ] indicates that fragmentation occurs even when the magnetic field dissipates in a relatively low - density region .",
    "therefore we expect that recurrent planet formation and intermittent outflow can occur even with more realistic treatment of the ambipolar diffusion",
    ".      only a few studies focused on the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk from the prestellar core stage .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated the circumstellar disk in unmagnetized clouds , and found that massive circumstellar disk formed at the early main accretion phase tends to show fragmentation . @xcite and @xcite pointed out that the disk forms before the protostar formation , and the circumstellar disk is inevitably massive than the protostar in the early accretion phase . this is because the circumstellar disk is originated from the first adiabatic core formed in the gas - collapsing phase before the protostar formation @xcite",
    "such massive circumstellar disk is prone to show fragmentation .",
    "these studies indicate the possibility of the formation of substellar- or planet - mass object in the unmagnetized circumstellar disk by the gravitational instability .    in the magnetized cloud core , only @xcite investigated the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk using two - dimensional simulation .",
    "although , they adopted the magnetic evolution in an approximate way instead of solving the induction equation , they presented several interesting results .",
    "they pointed out that fragmentation and planet formation is possible even in the magnetized circumstellar disk .",
    "they also showed that the gravitational instability or fragments temporarily amplifies the mass accretion rate onto the protostar that may account for the fu orionis outbursts .",
    "there are slight quantitative differences between @xcite and ours , because we calculated the circumstellar disk with a realistic process of the magnetic dissipation in three dimensions . however , our results are qualitatively the same as their results .",
    "this is because the circumstellar disk always experiences gravitationally unstable phase after the protostar formation .",
    "@xcite showed that , even in the magnetized cloud core , the circumstellar disk is massive than the protostar and becomes gravitationally unstable .",
    "such disk tends to show fragmentation in the early accretion phase .",
    "even when fragmentation does not occur in the early accretion phase , such massive disk is expected to show fragmentation in the later accretion or subsequent phase .",
    "thus , we expect that the planet formation due to the gravitational instability is common in the star formation process .",
    "to investigate the properties of the circumstellar disk during the main accretion phase , we calculated the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk and protostellar outflow in a magnetized collapsing cloud core from the prestellar core stage using three - dimensional nested - grid simulation that covers both the whole region of a nascent molecular cloud core and sub - au structure .",
    "we constructed two models with a parameter for the initial stability of cloud core ( the ratio of thermal energy to gravitational energy ) or total mass of the cloud core , in which the rotation rate and magnetic field strength were fixed , and calculated the evolution of the circumstellar disk about @xmath0yr after protostar formation .",
    "the different initial stabilities affect the rate of mass accretion onto the circumstellar disk ; that is , a relatively massive disk appears with a high mass accretion rate in a relatively thermally unstable cloud core .",
    "we obtained the following results from these calculations :    * _ * recurrent planet formation in the circumstellar disk * _ + the circumstellar disk formed in a relatively unstable cloud core is considerably massive because of the high rate of mass accretion onto the disk and is in a highly gravitationally unstable state .",
    "thus , fragmentation occurs and substellar - mass objects appear in the circumstellar disk .",
    "the substellar - mass objects lose their orbital angular momenta by gravitational interaction with the massive circumstellar disk and finally fall onto the protostar for @xmath4yr after their formation .",
    "after those objects fall , the circumstellar disk increases its mass by the mass accretion from the nascent cloud core and again shows fragmentation and subsequent falling of fragments onto the protostar .",
    "+ fragmentation and falling are repeated in the main accretion phase .",
    "the mass of fragments never reaches the hydrogen - burning limit of @xmath297 because the circumstellar disk self - regulates its mass during this recurrent planet formation process , that is , the circumstellar disk induces fragmentation and loses its mass when fragments fall onto the protostar before it becomes vary massive .",
    "thus , fragments formed in the main accretion phase hardly exceed the planet or brown - dwarf mass .",
    "it is expected that this recurrent planet formation process continues as long as the disk accretes mass at the high rate . however , mass accretion onto the disk decreases with time .",
    "thus , the final generation of fragments formed in the outer disk region just before the mass accretion stops ( or significantly decreases ) may survive to become long - lived planets or brown - dwarfs with long orbital periods , as recently observed @xcite . * _ * highly time - variable mass accretion * _ + in the main accretion phase , both models ( relatively stable and unstable models ) show non - steady mass accretion onto the central protostar . in a relatively stable cloud core that shows no fragmentation",
    ", the rate of mass accretion onto the protostar fluctuates in the range of @xmath298 to @xmath299 with a period of @xmath233yr .",
    "thus , highly time - variable mass accretion is seen in this model .",
    "the magnitude of the mass accretion rate almost corresponds to the theoretical prediction .",
    "the cycle of variation of the mass accretion rate ( or the accretion luminosity ) corresponds to the orbital period of the location of clear spiral arms that effectively transfer the angular momentum outward and promote protostellar mass accretion .",
    "the spiral arms only appear in the inner disk region where a considerably weak field is realized owing to the effective ohmic dissipation , and the angular momentum is not effectively transferred by the magnetic effect . as a result",
    ", the excess angular momentum causes the mass to accumulate in the inner disk region and increases the non - axisymmetric perturbation that promotes the mass accretion onto the protostar .",
    "+ instead , in the outer disk region where the magnetic field is well - coupled with neutrals , the non - asymmetric perturbation hardly grows because the angular momentum is effectively transferred by the magnetic effect . in summary , because the spiral structure induces the time - variable protostellar accretion , the typical period of the variation of the accretion luminosity corresponds to the orbital extent of the magnetically inactive zone where the spiral patterns appear .",
    "thus , the time variation or the cycle of the accretion luminosity is related to the magnetic dissipation process that is connected to the magnetic flux problem .",
    "although we adopted a very realistic value of the magnetic resistivity and ionization degree , we may also deduce them by observations of the luminosity variation of class 0 and i objects .",
    "in addition , the time variation of the accretion luminosity caused by spiral patterns may explain the luminosity dispersion of class 0 and i objects over 2 - 3 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "* _ * episodic mass accretion * _ + episodic mass accretion is seen in a relatively unstable cloud core .",
    "fragmentation occurs and substellar - mass objects repeatedly appear in the circumstellar disk formed in an unstable cloud core .",
    "the substellar - mass objects disturb the circumstellar disk and induce a strong episodic brightening of the protostar .",
    "the mass accretion rate is considerably low @xmath300   when the substellar - mass objects orbit in a region sufficiently far ( @xmath301au ) from the protostar , while the rate increases to @xmath302 as the substellar - mass objects approach ( @xmath303au ) the protostar .",
    "thus , during the main accretion phase , the protostar shows two distinct phases of mass accretion : quiescent and active mass accretion phases , as seen in @xcite .",
    "the protostar increases its luminosity ( @xmath304 ) by a significant mass accretion in the active phase that lasts only for @xmath233yr , while it dims ( @xmath305 ) in the quiescent phase that lasts for @xmath306yr .",
    "recent observations support episodic mass accretion to solve the luminosity problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , fuori - type outbursts also may be related to the episodic accretion caused by orbital motion and falling of the substellar - mass objects .",
    "however , we need further spatial resolution to associate them with actual observations . * _ * intermittent protostellar outflows * _ + both models show the outflow driven by the circumstellar disk .",
    "the steady outflow that lasts for @xmath307yr appears in a relatively stable cloud core , while the non - steady outflow appears in a relatively unstable cloud core . in a relatively stable cloud core ,",
    "spiral arms that promote mass accretion onto the protostar appear in the inner disk region where magnetic dissipation is effective and no outflow appears , while the outflow is driven by the outer disk region where an almost axisymmetric structure remains . as a result",
    ", time - variable mass accretion is caused by the inner disk region , while outflow is steadily driven by the stable outer disk region .",
    "+ on the other hand , in a relatively unstable cloud core , the outflow driven by the circumstellar disk shows a strong time variability because substellar - mass objects disturb magnetic field lines in the whole circumstellar disk . as a result",
    ", the episodic ( or intermittent ) outflow appears with episodic mass accretion .",
    "thus , intermittent outflow may be proof of the existence of planets or substellar - mass objects in the circumstellar disk .",
    "in addition , variable periods of the outflow well synchronize with the orbital period of substellar - mass objects .",
    "thus , we may be able to predict the existence of a planet and its orbital period with detailed observation of the trail of the protostellar outflow",
