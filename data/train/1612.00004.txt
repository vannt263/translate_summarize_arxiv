    "i.e. _ the interface remains flat and smooth , but an instability develops when the difference in the velocities reaches a critical value .",
    "originally the two flows were assumed inviscid , but ever since the incorporation of viscous effects has proven problematic .",

    "another intriguing suggestion is to use the kh instability for modelling a hydrodynamic analogue of the event horizon of a gravitational black - hole singularity , since the instability involves flows at different velocities : the velocities of the mass shear flows along the interface and the velocity of the surface wave excited on the interface @xcite .",
    "the superfluid kh instability has also emerged as one of the possible mechanisms by which a sudden equilibrium could be reached in one  glitch \" between the angular momentum reservoirs of the superfluid and normal fractions of a spinning neutron star @xcite . the sudden discontinuous glitch - like  spin - up event \" in the neutron star s rotation velocity was found to match in magnitude the angular velocity jump which one might expect in a typical kh instability event when the outward directed motion of quantized vortices across an interface between two different neutron condensates is calculated .",

    "<S> the kelvin - helmholtz instability is well - known in classical hydrodynamics , where it explains the sudden emergence of interfacial surface waves as a function of the velocity of flow parallel to the interface . </S>",
    "<S> it can be carried over to the inviscid two - fluid dynamics of superfluids , to study different types of interfaces and phase boundaries in quantum fluids . </S>",
    "<S> we report measurements on the stability of the phase boundary separating the two bulk phases of superfluid @xmath0he in rotating flow , while the boundary is localized with the gradient of the magnetic field to a position perpendicular to the rotation axis . </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate that the classic stability condition , when modified for the superfluid environment , is obeyed down to @xmath1 , if a large fraction of the magnetic polarization of the b - phase is attributed to a parabolic reduction of the interfacial surface tension with increasing magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> key words : superfluid @xmath0he , hydrodynamic instability , phase boundary , quantized vortex , vortex dynamics , interfacial surface tension </S>"
