    "quantum teleportation has an indispensable role in the manipulation of quantum states and processing of quantum information @xcite .",
    "usually , the two - mode squeezed vacuum is often used as the entanglement resource with continuous - variable ( cv ) . however , due to the limit of experiment , it is hard to achieve high degree of squeezing which leads to a low effect of teleportation fidelity .    in order to increase the entanglement and fidelity of teleportation , a number of stratigies",
    "have been proposed @xcite . among them ,",
    "non - gaussian operations including the photon subtraction @xmath0 or addition @xmath1 or the superposition of both can be used to realize this purpose for given vaidman - brauntein - kimble ( vbk ) scheme .",
    "for example , the superposition  operator @xmath2 is proposed for quantum state engineering to transform a classical state to a nonclassical one @xcite , and then is performed on two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) for enhancing quantum entanglement as well as the fidelity of teleportation @xcite .",
    "it is found that the fidelity teleporting coherent state can be further improved by optimizing the superposition operation compared with the other non - gaussian states , such as photon - subtraction tmsv . as another example",
    ", a remarkable improvement of the teleportation fidelity with cv can be obtained by introducing another optimal non - gaussian resources when given the usual and ( non-)ideal vbk scheme @xcite by considering imperfect bell measurements and damping . in ref . [",
    "17 ] , the shot - fidelity  and single - gain factor are used to discuss the performance of teleportation .",
    "in fact , these protocols above are employed to enhance the fidelity of teleportation by changing quantum entangled resources .",
    "then an inverse question is that given a certain class of entangled resources with some given properties , how we can modify the vbk scheme to improve the fidelity of teleportation .",
    "it is interesting to notice that there is an alternative method to improve the fidelity of teleportation by using calssical information .",
    "for instance , the teleportation fidelity of cv can be enhanced by tuning the gain in the measurement dependent modulation on the output field @xcite in heisenberg picture and epr resources without loss , which has been realized experimentally by furusawa et al @xcite .",
    "however , these two important theoretical works are concerned with the study of the ideal protocol implementation using gaussian resources @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are some other strategies of gain tuning and of optimal gain @xcite , using the heisenberg picture and the wigner function , but they can not be directly applied to more general cases . in addition , in refs .",
    "@xcite the gain factor is used to maximize the teleportation fidelity for the case of gaussian resources , but the gain - optimized fidelity of teleportation is strongly suppressed when considered the dissipation . recently ,",
    "a hybrid entanglement swapping protocol is proposed experimentally to transfer discrete - variable ( dv ) entanglement by using continuous - variable ( cv ) gaussian entangled resources and by tuning a gain factor of the teleporter @xcite , which shows that dv entanglement remains present after teleportation for any squeezing by optimal gain tuning . for more information about advances in quantum teleportation",
    ", we refer to a recent review paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "the fidelity of teleportation , as mentioned above , can be improved by using tunable entangled resources or classical parameters @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a three - parameter optimal stratigy is introduced to improve the quality of teleporttaion , including unbalanced beam splitter ( bs ) and two non - unity gains .",
    "however , they only considered an ideal case .",
    "actually , the interaction between quantum system and environment can not be avoided and bell measurements are usually imperfect .",
    "thus , it would be interesting that whether it is still effective to enhance the fidelity by using these tunable parameters in realistic case . in this paper , using the characteristics function ( cf ) formalism , we shall extend the analysis of the parameter optimization strategy for realistic input states and non - ideal entangled resources and investigate the nonideal quantum teleportation by deriving an analytical expression of the teleportation fidelity .",

    "and then we present a qualitative description about fidelity and average fidelity . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the analytical expression of the fidelity of teleportation when the tmsv and coherent states are used as entangled channel and teleported states , respectively . in sec .",
    "iv we study the performance of amplitude - independent optimal fidelity using the condition found in sec .",
    "it is found that the optimal condition is just that the two - gain factors and @xmath3 are equal to unit and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "v is devoted to discussing the optimal fidelity over these three tunable parameters and three different probability distributions for the input coherent states by deriving the analytical expression of the optimal fidelity .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "here , we consider a more realistic case of teleportation scheme shown in fig . 1(a ) . in this scheme ,",
    "there are three tunable parameters , unbanlanced bs and two non - unity gains ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the input state ( mode 1 ) and the entangled resources ( shared by modes 2 and 3 ) are not limited to be pure states .",
    "considering that the mode 2 can be prepared close to the sender alice while the mode 3 usually has to propagate over much longer distance , we can assume that the mode 2 is not affected by losses but the mode 3 is .",
    "in addition , two symmetrical lossy bosonic channel have been considered before making bell measurements , which are simulated through an extra vacuum mode and a beam splitter with transmission coefficient @xmath7 .",
