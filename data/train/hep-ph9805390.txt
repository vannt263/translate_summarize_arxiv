    "for instance , it has been shown that the alternative expressions @xmath9 lead to a breit - wigner resonance with an @xmath3-dependent width and , in the @xmath10-boson case , can be identified with the mass and width measured at lep @xcite",

    "( [ eq : os ] ) . on the other hand , in the case of gauge theories , the pole definitions have an important advantage :",
    "general arguments imply that the pole position @xmath11 and , therefore , also @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are gauge invariant . by contrast",
    ", it has been shown that the on - shell definitions of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and unstable - quark masses become gauge dependent in @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that the on - shell definition of width is inadequate if @xmath2 is not analytic in the neighborhood of @xmath18 .",
    "this occurs , for example , when the mass of the decaying particle lies very close to a threshold @xcite or , in the resonance region , when the unstable particle is coupled to massless quanta , such as in the case of the @xmath19 boson and unstable quarks @xcite .    the aim of this letter is to discuss , in leading order , the difference between the on - shell mass and width and their pole counterparts for a very important case , namely the higgs boson .",

    "fig : one](a ) that , aside from the neighborhoods of the abysses , @xmath65 and @xmath66 remain numerically very close to @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the intermediate case ( @xmath67  gev ) ,",
    "the relative differences reach 0.6% in the mass and 3.3% in the width .",
    "however , for a heavy higgs boson ( @xmath68  gev ) , the differences become very large , reaching 11% in the mass and 44% in the width .",
    "the largest differences occur for @xmath69 , i.e. , when the unphysical excitations decouple , a range that includes the unitary gauge .",
    "we recall that the latter retains only the physical degrees of freedom and , in this sense , it may be regarded as the most physical of all gauges .",

    "( [ eq : bos ] ) . if @xmath70 , the second term in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : bos ] ) does not contribute , so that @xmath71 . for a heavy higgs boson , this implies large values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for @xmath72 ,",
    "the gauge - dependent terms contribute and cancel the leading @xmath73 dependence of @xmath74 , so that the magnitudes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 drop sharply and the differences become much smaller .",
    "of course , the 44% effect in the width for @xmath69 may cast doubts on the convergence of the expansions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) . we interpret this finding as an indication of large corrections rather than a precise evaluation of @xmath58 .",
    "our results go beyond those reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the reason is easy to understand : in ref .",
    "@xcite , the limits @xmath75 and @xmath76 are simultaneously considered keeping the higgs self - coupling @xmath77 fixed . if the gauge parameter @xmath59 is also kept fixed , the gauge dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bos ] ) is lost , and one obtains an @xmath3-independent result for @xmath74 , which does not contribute to the right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) .",
    "thus , the above approximation , although interesting and useful , does not exhibit the gauge dependence and the large effects discussed here .    from the horizontal lines across figs .",
    "[ fig : one](a)(c ) , we see that the pt mass and width remain very close to @xmath6 and @xmath7 for all values of @xmath6 , the maximum departures being 0.7% for @xmath49 and @xmath78 for @xmath50 at @xmath68  gev .",
    "the differences vary somewhat if @xmath65 and @xmath66 are compared with @xmath12 and @xmath13 . through @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    "are obtained from @xmath57 and @xmath58 by subtracting the gauge - invariant term @xmath82 . for @xmath68",
    "gev , @xmath80 and @xmath81 amount to 5.6% and 38% in the unitary gauge ( rather than 11% and 44% ) and to @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the t  hooft - feynman gauge ( rather than 0.9% and @xmath85 ) .",
    "for the same value of @xmath6 , the differences @xmath86 and @xmath87 are @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( rather than 0.7% and @xmath78 ) .    in summary , we have shown that , in leading order , the differences between the on - shell mass and width of a heavy higgs boson and their pole counterparts are sensitive functions of the gauge parameter , and reach large numerical values in a class of gauges that includes the unitary gauge .",
    "for other frequently employed gauges , such as @xmath90 ( t  hooft - feynman gauge ) and @xmath91 ( landau gauge ) , the differences are very small with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but are not negligible relative to @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for intermediate ( light ) higgs bosons ,",
    "the differences are reasonably ( very ) small for all values of @xmath59 , except in the abysses described above .",
    "the pt on - shell mass and width remain close to @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the range 200  gev@xmath92  gev .",
    "these results give further support to the proposition that a consistent definition of two of the most important concepts in particle physics , namely those of mass and width of an unstable particle , must ultimately be based on the pole position rather than the on - shell approach @xcite .",
    "for many purposes , the well - known and convenient machinery of the latter can be employed , but physicists should become aware of its limitations and potential pitfalls .",
