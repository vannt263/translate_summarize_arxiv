    "collisionless self - gravitating systems ( sgs ) eventually settle down to a quasi - equilibrium state through the phase mixing and the violent relaxation processes under the potential oscillation@xcite .",
    "this quasi - equilibrium state is a prototype of the astronomical objects such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies",
    ". these objects often show universal profiles in various aspects",
    ".    it would be true that the energy distribution function and the mass density distribution function are quite appropriate to characterize sgs , and actually many studies have been done from this viewpoint .",
    "for example , the density profile is found to be @xmath4 in spherical and cold collapses , _",
    "i.e. , _ collapses with small initial virial ratio @xcite and @xmath5 in the cluster - pair merging processes@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity distribution function has not fully been examined so far despite its importance ; anisotropy of velocity dispersion or lower moments of velocity distributions with respect to the deviations from gaussian distributions have been mainly examined ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". however , the full velocity distribution function plays an important role in identifying the quasi - equilibrium state , which should be properly characterized by the whole phase - space probability functions .",
    "et al . _ numerically showed that the velocity distributions in the central regions of the bound particles become gaussian , when the bound particles are well relaxed @xcite .",
    "however , since sgs are manifestly non - additive systems @xcite , the ordinary gaussian distribution would not be expected for the whole bound particles . moreover , such non - gaussian velocity distributions would be firmly connected with the density profile characteristic to sgs @xcite .",
    "recently , we have simulated self - gravitating n - body systems by utilizing the leap - frog symplectic integrator on grape-5 , a special - purpose computer designed to accelerate n - body simulations@xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed mainly in the case with cold collapse initial conditions .",
    "it is certain that the processes may be too simplified to deduce the ultimate nature of actual sgss , in which merging or tidal effects take place .",
    "however , one of our main goals is to establish the universal properties of sgs through the violent relaxation process , i.e. the relaxation through the oscillation of gravitational potential .",
    "this process is rather common in actual sgss such as galaxies and dark matters . in this context ,",
    "the cold collapse is considered to be a typical case which causes the violent relaxation .",
    "hence it is meaningful to examine the cold collapse as a first step .",
    "when the system experiences violent gravitational processes such as a cold collapse and a cluster - pair collision , we obtained a universal velocity distribution profile expressed as the democratic ( = equally weighted ) superposition of gaussian distributions of various temperatures(dt distribution hereafter ) in which the local temperature @xmath6 is defined using the local velocity variance @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the particle mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have found that the locally defined temperature linearly falls down in the intermediate cluster region outside the central part , provided it is described against the cumulative mass @xmath10 , _",
    "@xmath11 this fact is consistent with the appearance of dt distributions .",
    "furthermore to the linear tm relation , we have also obtained another peculiar fact that the lv relation between the locally defined potential energy and kinetic energy holds except for the weak fluctuations .",
    "more precisely , the local temperature @xmath6 is proportional to the local potential @xmath12 , with constant proportionality @xmath13 for a wide class of cold collapse simulations .",
    "it was originally pointed out by eddington that plummer s model satisfies this condition exactly @xcite .",
    "moreover it was also pointed out that plummer s model can be extended to the anisotropic model of a stellar system satisfing the lv relation @xcite .",
    "we found that the bound region , _",
    "i.e. , _ the region composed of the bound particles keeps this relation quite well at least during the time interval much longer than the initial crossing time .",
    "this is a prominent correlation in the phase space distribution function , and also constructs another backbone character of sgs after a cold collapse .    in sec.[sec :",
    "level2 ] and [ sec : level3 ] , we will show that the above two hypotheses for sgs are supported by the results of a variety of cold collapse simulations . then in sec.[sec : level4 ] , combining the two hypotheses , _",
    "i.e. , _ the linear tm relation and the lv relation , we obtain a unique density profile @xmath14 which asymptotically behaves as @xmath15 . justification of this density profile will also be discussed .",
    "in sec.[sec : relaxation ] , we will ascertain that the above two hypotheses can arise even in the collisionless quasi - equilibrium state , where the region inside a half - mass radius is not yet under the effect of two - body relaxation . in sec.[sec : models ] the above two hypotheses will be explored in two typical collisionless static models with spherical configuration and isotropic velocity dispersions ; polytropes and king models .",
    "sec.[sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the summaries and conclusions of this paper .",
    "let us now further consider the linear tm relation . in our recent work @xcite ,",
    "we have examined the velocity distribution function of collisionless sgs after a cold collapse in numerical n - body calculations . according to this work , immediately after a cold collapse , well - relaxed and almost spherical - symmetric bound state is formed . in order to examine the local property",
    ", we use the cumulative mass @xmath16 within the radius @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath18 as a measure of the radial distance from the cluster center , which is defined as the position of the potential minimum . in our numerical simulation",
    ", we divide the whole system into several concentric shells with equal width in the coordinate @xmath16 and consider the averaged quantities within each shell as local variables .    in our simulation , particles in the outermost region , which includes @xmath19 of the total mass ,",
    "escape almost freely just after the cold collapse and are irrelevant to the quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "therefore we concentrate on the local temperature within the inner region initially including @xmath20 of the total mass .",
    "more precisely , we define the bound particles as the particles inside the @xmath21 , at which the local temperature @xmath22 takes the minimum value . hereafter , we pay our attention to the bound region composed of these bound particles . in the central part of this region ,",
    "the two - body relaxation proceeds and the particles evaporate toward outside .",
    "moreover , in this central region , the effect of cutoff @xmath23 proposed in numerical simulations can not be ignored completely . discarding this part from the bound region",
    ", we found , that the local velocity variance , _",
    "i.e. , _ the local temperature linearly decreases to zero in the coordinate @xmath16 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a positive constant and @xmath26 is the total mass of the bound particles at @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath26 is initially equal to @xmath20 of the total mass but is gradually diminished , as several particles evaporate from the bound state .",
    "here we examined the deviation of tm relation from the linear relation ( [ tmrel ] ) for a variety of simulations of cold collapse . for the estimate of the deviation , we first take the time - average for the velocity dispersion at each shell to derive the time - averaged @xmath28-mass relation .",
    "then we linearly fit it as ( [ tmrel ] ) to derive @xmath29 and subtract it from @xmath28 . in fig.[tm ] , the deviation normalized by @xmath28 at the half mass radius are depicted for several simulations with total particle s number @xmath30 .",
    "the deviations are very small and are less than 10 percent at each @xmath21 for all of the simulations we examined .",
    "hence , this result is quite robust against initial conditions with @xmath30 provided the collapse is cold . even for the case of cluster - pair collision , this linear relation is widely obtained .",
    "we also examined the @xmath31 dependence of the linear tm relation for the case with initially homogeneous spherical sphere ( fig.[tm - diffn ] ) .",
    "as @xmath31 increases , the particles collapse more and more coherently , which causes a shock region moving slowly outward after a collapse .",

    "besides the linear tm relation , there is another characteristic for sgs as we now argue .",
    "it is well known that the gravitationally bound system approaches a virialized state satisfying the condition @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are , respectively , the averaged potential energy and kinetic energy of the whole bound system .",
    "this is a global relation that holds for the entire system , after the initial coherent motion fades out .",
    "here we define the locally averaged potential energy and kinetic energy inside the radius @xmath17 , respectively as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 means the local object @xmath57 evaluated at @xmath58",

    "hence , we define the lv ratio @xmath63 and examine the value of @xmath64 for each shell . for a wide class of collapses including cluster - pair collision examined in @xcite , the value @xmath64 takes almost unity :",
    "it deviates from unity less than 10 percent upward in the intermediate region and a little more downward in the inner and outer region for all of the simulations with @xmath30(fig.[lv ] ) .",

    "we also examined the n - dependence of the lv relation for the cases in fig.[lv - diffn ] .",
    "we got the result that the lv relation is affected by the shock as well as the linear tm relation in the case with @xmath65,where the lv ratio @xmath60 takes the peak at the shock region .",
    "the value @xmath60 becomes smaller than unity around the shock region in order to compensate for the enhance at the shock region .",
    "however , @xmath60 oscillates around unity even in such cases , which supports the lv relation in the zeroth order . hence",
    ", this lv relation should be an another characteristic of sgs , and this is our second hypothesis .",
    "we have explored the two hypotheses of sgs so far , _ i.e. , _ the linear tm relation eq.([tmrel ] ) and the lv relation eq.([localvir2 ] ) for the bound cluster .",
    "combining these two relations , we now derive a mass density profile .",
    "we simply substitute eq.([localvir2 ] ) into eq.([tmrel ] ) to obtain @xmath66 . differentiating this with @xmath17 and using poisson s equation",

    "the velocity dispersion of a bound system becomes radially anisotropic especially in the outer regions @xcite . in the preceding section , however , we showed that the two hypotheses are achieved quite well even in the inner isotropic and collisionless region for a mild collapsing case .",

    "the strong deviation for @xmath169 is obvious , since the central temperature becomes much higher than those in the outer side for this parameter range .    in summary",

    "in this paper , we have proposed ( a ) the linear tm relation and ( b ) the lv relation as the hypotheses of self - gravitating structures after a cold collapse .",
    "based on these two hypothetical proposals , we have uniquely determined the mass density profile ( [ sotakai ] ) in the quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "our density profile behaves as @xmath190 in the outer region and fits well both to the data of cold collapse simulations .",
    "although this density profile is unphysical in the inner region , where it decreases with the decreasing radius , we showed that such an unphysical region is just a few percent around the central region of the bound state .",
    "hence , we can safely neglect this region at least for the resolution of our numerical results .    in the central region",
    ", we also have to notice the relaxation process in such a central region .",
    "in fact , we examined how two - body relaxation is developed in a bound state after a cold collapse .",
    "we estimated the time scale of the two - body relaxation with @xmath83 , which is defined as the time when the region within a half - mass radius achieves a two - body relaxation on average .",
    "both the linear tm relation and the lv relation appear even when the two - body relaxation is not attained .",
    "hence , we can say that our two hypotheses are not affected through the two - body relaxation but are characteristic even in collisionless system in our estimation with @xmath83 . from a viewpoint of these two hypotheses",
    ", we compared our results with two isotropic static models , i.e . ,",
    "polytropes and king models .",
    "the polytrope with @xmath123 is special among those models , since it exactly satisfies the lv relation .",
    "plummer s model , the polytrope with @xmath191 with a flat boundary condition at the center also satisfies the constant tm relation quite well in the intermediate region @xmath192 .",
    "moreover , its density fits well to the numerical data quite well in this intermediate region . on the other hand , both its tm relation and density profile in the outer region are slightly shifted from those in cold collapse simulations : the temperature falls off more steeply and the density behaves as @xmath193 in the outer region . as for king models , in contrast , there is no parameter range in which both the tm relation and density profile fit well to the numerical data even in the intermediate region .",
    "we also examined the deviations from the two hypotheses quantitatively for these two models .",
    "only the polytropes with @xmath131 are acceptable in that their deviations from both of the hypotheses are compatible with the numerical results of cold collapse .",
    "the lv relation imposes a strong constraint for these models . especially for king models ,",
    "the deviation from lv relation takes the maximum value around the parameter @xmath194 , in which the surface brightness fits well to @xmath166 law .",
    "this suggests that considering only the asymptotic behavior of the bound state is not enough to describe the collisionless static models to express observational or numerical results .    combining the results for the above two models",
    ", we can speculate that plummer s model follows both of the hypotheses we proposed ( a ) lv relation and ( b ) linear tm relation . however , this model is lack of the following properties of the bound states in the actual simulations of cold collapse : ( i ) deviation from a hydrostatic equilibrium state and ( ii ) anisotropy of velocity dispersion in the outer region .",
    "as for ( i ) , the hydrostatic equilibrium condition is not attained especially when the violent degree of the initial collapse is strong , since the bound state slowly expands outward and is not balanced with a gravitational force after a cold collapse .",
    "hence , to express these conditions we may have to consider not the static solution but the stationary solution admitting the coherent motion of matters .    as for ( ii )",
    ", we derived that for a mild collapsing case , the lv relation fluctuates more largely in the outer region and the slope of the tm relation at this region becomes a little steeper at least in the collisionless stage .",
    "we suspect that these results are related to the anisotropy of this system .",
    "hence for more precise description of the system possessing two hypotheses , it seems necessary to treat the model with the anisotropy of the velocity dispersion .",
    "so far several collisionless static models with the anisotropic velocity dispersions or with the non - spherical symmetry have been proposed @xcite .",
    "incompleteness of the violent relaxation or the existence of conservative quantities during the phase mixing seem to be a candidate as the model to induce such anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the hypotheses we proposed are expected to be used as a guideline to build up the models following the characters of the bound states after a cold collapse by combining with these anisotropic models .",
    "it also seems important how widely our two hypotheses are applicable in more general mixing processes including a merging process which yields a cuspy density profile in the central region @xcite .",
    "if we want to know the detail of such a tiny central region , such as the existence of the cuspy density profile , we have to treat such a central region more carefully .",
    "we speculate that in such a region , at least one of the two hypotheses we proposed will be broken .",
    "these points are now under investigation .",

    "all numerical simulations were carried out on grape system at adac ( the astronomical data analysis center ) of the national astronomical observatory , japan .",
    "the analytical solution ( [ sotakai ] ) has an inner unphysical region at @xmath195 .",
    "since the density goes to zero toward the center in this region , the cumulative mass in this region becomes very small .",
    "here we will check how much the value is modified when we put the constant mass density in this region and connect it to the analytical solution at @xmath196 . from the continuity at @xmath196 ,",
    "the density becomes = \\",

    "hence the mass fraction of the inner region becomes = = 0.0243 .",
