    "there has recently been considerable interest in constraining the parameter space of type ii two higgs doublet models .",
    "the main reason for this interest , of course , is that the higgs sectors of minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model are generically of this type  @xcite .",
    "the charged higgs sectors of two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm s ) may be characterized by the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath14 , and the mass of the charged higgs , @xmath15 . in this work",
    "we will investigate how the exclusive decay channel @xmath16 may be used to place tight constraints on the ratio @xmath4 .",
    "this channel is expected to have a branching ratio on the order of half a percent  @xcite , so that one would expect on the order of @xmath17 such decays at the @xmath1 factories which are currently under construction .",
    "there already exist several constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the most direct lower bound on the charged higgs mass comes from the non - observation of charged higgs pairs in @xmath18 decays and gives @xmath19 gev  @xcite .",
    "another limit comes from top decays , which yield the bound @xmath20 gev for large @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "finally , for pure type ii 2hdm s one finds @xmath21 gev , coming from the virtual higgs contributions to @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "this latter limit disappears in the context of supersymmetry since the higgs contributions to @xmath23 can be cancelled by other contributions  @xcite .",
    "there are no experimental upper bounds on the mass of the charged higgs , but one generally expects to have @xmath24 tev in order that perturbation theory remain valid  @xcite .",
    "a lower limit may be placed on @xmath14 by considering the branching ratio for @xmath25 . the resulting bound of @xmath26 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , coincides with the range generally favoured by theorists in order that renormalization group evolution drive electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . for large @xmath14 the most stringent constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath15 are actually on their ratio , @xmath4",
    "the current limits come from the measured branching ratio for the inclusive decay @xmath27 , giving @xmath28 gev@xmath7  @xcite , and from the upper limit on the branching ratio for @xmath29 , giving @xmath30 gev@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "while both of these limits are quoted as being at the @xmath31 confidence level , the latter may be somewhat less constraining due to the uncertainties in @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to investigate the sensitivity of the exclusive decay @xmath16 to the ratio @xmath4 .",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath0 distribution for this decay and discuss how the theoretical uncertainties in this distribution may be minimized .",
    "we also apply the optimized weighting procedure  @xcite to this distribution in order to derive quantitative estimates for the sensitivities of experiments with given numbers of events .",
    "this procedure can be shown to give the smallest statistical uncertainty when analyzing the data in a given experiment .",
    "the present work complements the previous theoretical studies of the inclusive  @xcite and exclusive  @xcite semi - tauonic @xmath1 decays , as well as those of the purely leptonic decays @xmath34  @xcite and @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "these decays are attractive because the higgs contribution occurs at tree - level and can not be cancelled by , for example , supersymmetric loop effects .",
    "thus , the results of our analysis should be applicable to any type ii 2hdm  @xcite this situation may be contrasted with that in @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "a feature which is common to all of the tauonic and semi - tauonic @xmath1 decays is that the higgs contribution to the amplitude interferes destructively with that due to the standard model ( sm ) . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding integrated partial widths , plotted as functions of @xmath4 , tend to have minima around @xmath36 ",
    "@xmath37 gev@xmath7 .",
    "most studies to date have concentrated on the region to the right of the minimum , where the higgs contribution to the width begins to dominate over the sm contribution .",
    "indeed , the present experimental limits  derived using _ integrated _ partial widths  correspond to this region . in order to use semi - tauonic",
    "decays to probe values of @xmath4 near and/or below the minimum , it will be extremely useful to have detailed theoretical predictions for quantities beyond simply the integrated partial widths .",
    "this is because the plots of the widths as functions of @xmath4 are generically relatively flat up to @xmath38 gev@xmath7 .",
    "several authors have suggested using the energy distribution or longitudinal polarization of the @xmath39 in this regard , but this may be difficult experimentally since two neutrinos are always lost . an alternative approach , which we will study in detail , is to use the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "a possible drawback of this approach is that the @xmath0 distribution is very sensitive to theoretical uncertainties in the shapes of the hadronic form factors .",
    "as we shall see , however , the situation in the exclusive channel @xmath16 appears to be quite encouraging .",
    "the reason for this is that once the distribution for @xmath40 has been measured , that for @xmath16 can be predicted with relatively small theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the resulting distribution is quite sensitive to @xmath4 , even for relatively small values of this ratio .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 distribution has a qualitatively different shape for values of @xmath4 above and below the `` critical value '' , @xmath41 gev@xmath7 .",
    "we have chosen to focus on the decay channel @xmath16 instead of on @xmath42 , even though the latter channel will likely have a somewhat larger branching ratio and may also be more accessible experimentally ( in analogy with the decays to the lighter leptons  @xcite ) than the former . our main motivation for considering @xmath16 rather than @xmath42 is simply that the higgs contribution has a much larger effect in the former case . this feature has already been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite and is in part due to an enhancement by a factor @xmath43 in the effective interaction . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this enhancement effect means that the exclusive @xmath44 channel is also more sensitive than the _ inclusive _ channel , since the less - sensitive @xmath45 mode tends to dilute the inclusive measurement .",
    "the plan of the remainder of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] by deriving the @xmath0 distribution for @xmath16 in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath46 . in sec .",

    "this feature illustrates a trend which we have already mentioned above : since the @xmath42 channel is not very sensitive to the higgs and since it has a relatively large branching ratio , it tends to `` dilute '' the inclusive mode , making it less sensitive to the higgs contribution .",
    "[ fig : rhoav ] also illustrates why it is useful to have additional information besides the integrated width .",

    "for the three cases shown in the plot , this corresponds to /m_h -12.5pt1.6pt\\ {    ll 0.039 ^-1 , & n=10 ^ 4 + 0.052 ^-1 , & n=310 ^ 3 + 0.069 ^ -1 , & n=10 ^ 3 ,    . [ eq : tanbmh3 ] in reasonable agreement with the exact results indicated in the plot . the upper bounds determined in this way would represent significant improvements on the current limits , which are @xmath160 gev@xmath7 and @xmath161 gev@xmath7 ( coming from the inclusive semi - tauonic and tauonic @xmath1 decays , respectively ) .",
    "recall , furthermore , that the current theoretical uncertainties in the form factors would limit the reach of even an ideal experiment ( with infinite statistics ) to about @xmath6 gev@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ) .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tanbmh3 ] ) that already with about @xmath158 events one will have reached this limit .",
    "this approach is also extremely sensitive to non - zero input values of @xmath4 . as an example , we have calculated @xmath147 for a 2hdm with @xmath13 gev@xmath7 . the resulting plot , given as a function of @xmath4 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] .",
    "the solid , dashed and short - dashed curves correspond again to @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath9 events , respectively .",
    "the intercepts of the three curves at @xmath156 determine how well one can differentiate between this 2hdm and the sm in each case .",
    "thus , for example , with about @xmath9 events one can differentiate between this model and the sm at approximately the @xmath12 level .",
    "in this paper we have examined the sensitivity of the exclusive decay @xmath16 to the tree - level charged higgs contribution which is generic to type ii two higgs doublet models .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution in this decay is extremely sensitive to the ratio @xmath4 and may be used to appreciably improve the existing upper bounds on this quantity or , as the case may be , to measure a non - zero value .",
    "we have shown that while the existing theoretical uncertainties on this distribution are rather large , they will be reduced significantly once the analogous distribution for @xmath162 is measured more precisely .",
    "we estimate that , barring any further theoretical reductions in the uncertainty , this would eventually ( i.e. , assuming an infinite number of experimental events ) allow one to rule out a 2hdm with @xmath163 gev@xmath7 .",
    "we have also applied the optimized weighting technique to the @xmath0 distribution in order to calculate the minimum statistical uncertainty which could be attained for an experiment with a given number of events .",
    "the results of this analysis are very encouraging , showing , for example , that with just @xmath9 events one could rule out a 2hdm with @xmath164 gev@xmath7 . with the same number of events one could differentiate between a 2hdm with @xmath165 gev@xmath7 and the sm at the @xmath12 level .    in the present work we have not made any use of the spin of the final state @xmath39 . in principle , this extra observable",
    "could be used to improve the sensitivity of a given experiment . in practice",
    ", one has to allow the @xmath39 to decay and study the distribution of its decay products .",
    "we have , in fact , used the optimized weighting procedure to study these distributions in the hadronic decay channels @xmath166 and @xmath167 . the differential distributions in these cases",
    "may be written as functions of @xmath0 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath168 and @xmath170 are the energy and angle ( with respect to the momentum of the @xmath44 ) of the meson @xmath171 in the @xmath39@xmath172@xmath173 rest - frame .",
    "( recall that we wish to avoid observables which depend explicitly on the momentum of the @xmath39 . )",
    "the upshot of this analysis is that for a fixed number of events , the upper limit on @xmath4 is improved by at most about @xmath174 . in general , however , one can also expect a reduction in the number of events since one is now considering a very specific decay mode of the @xmath39 .",
    "thus one is likely not to gain anything at all .",
    "it is thus our opinion that the @xmath0 distribution represents perhaps the best tool which may be used in order to search for a charged higgs signal in @xmath16 .",
