    "in the past few years , substantial studies of chemical abundances in planetary nebulae ( pne ) in the discs of local spirals have begun to appear .",
    "so far , the galaxies observed include only m31 , m33 , ngc 300 , and m81 .",
    "these observations lagged behind their counterparts in the bulge of m31 , cen a , and dwarf galaxies due to the challenge of separating them from the numerous compact h ii regions and the diffuse ionized gas that pervades spiral discs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a list of the data ) . given the area of spiral discs , multi - object spectrographs , employing both slits and fibres , have had to be used to obtain the required data .",
    "the reader should keep in mind that the pne observed thus far are all among the brightest pne in their galaxies , and it is not yet clear that these necessarily sample the entire population of pne or the entire population of stars that give rise to pne . for a complementary view of the bright pne in dwarf galaxies , see gonalves ( this volume ) or ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* dopita et al .",

    "this may mostly reflect that the chemical evolution of the discs of spirals is slow .",
    "the bulge of m31 shows a greater range of oxygen abundances than the spiral discs .    in the top panel of fig .",

    "* peimbert et al .",
    "2007 , izotov et al . 2014 ) ) as well as a value 50% larger are shown , between which most of the measurements lie .",
    "since most of the progenitor stars of these bright pne were formed with a helium abundance above the primordial value , the enrichment of the helium abundance in the envelope during the evolution of these stars must have been less than 50% .",

    "[ fig1 ] presents the @xmath4 abundance ratio as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the top right part of this diagram defines the region in which type i pne within the milky way are found ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* perinotto et al . 2004 ) ) .",
    "clearly , the progenitor stars of all bright pne in local spirals formed from gas that had suffered some level of secondary enrichment , because the lower envelope to the data exceeds the expectation for primary production of nitrogen by type ii supernovae as judged from observations in metal - poor star - forming galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* izotov et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "with respect to the secondary enrichment level , the stellar progenitors of these pne further enriched their envelopes during their evolution , typically by less than a factor of 10 ( 1.0dex ) , but even so a challenge for models .    finally , the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the excellent correlation between oxygen and neon abundances .",
    "the solid line is the relation between oxygen and neon abundances observed in star - forming galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* izotov et al . 2006 ) ) , the result of the yields from type ii supernovae . evidently , if the progenitors of bright pne in local spirals follow the same relation , either they modify neither abundance or modify both so as to maintain the proportion seen in the interstellar medium of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we compare these observations with the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* karakas ( 2010 ; henceforth k10 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cristallo et al . ( 2011 ; c11 ) ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pignatari et al . ( 2013 ; p13 ) ) . while these models may not span the entire parameter space available , they are indicative of the results from models with conservative implementations of semi - convection . at the risk of over - generalizing ,",
    "their helium production is similar and modest .",
    "k10 produces somewhat more nitrogen than the other models , especially for masses below 3 - 4m@xmath5 , but less neon and much less oxygen ( some k10 models even consume oxygen ) .",
    "p13 produce substantially more oxygen than k10 or c11 .",
    "all of these models are able to produce type i pne only for @xmath6m@xmath5 and k10 can exceed the enrichment observed .",
    "we recall that the relevant metallicity range for the observations presented here is @xmath7 .",
    "the observation that is most decisive concerning the mass of the progenitor stars is the tight correlation of oxygen and neon abundances .",
    "the mass above which the @xmath8 ratio departs from the observed value is approximately @xmath9m@xmath5 ( @xmath10 ) and 2.0m@xmath5 ( @xmath11 ) , for k10 and c11 , respectively .",
    "the p13 models at @xmath12 are marginally compatible with the observed relation , but none of their models are compatible at lower metallicities ( due to oxygen production ) .",
    "the rarity of type i pne imply that high mass stellar progenitors produce very few bright pne .",
    "therefore , these model results indicate that the stellar progenitors of bright pne in local spirals typically have masses of about 2.0m@xmath5 or less .    interpreting nitrogen abundances",
    "is complicated ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* richer & mccall 2008 ) ) .",
    "no models can increase @xmath4 by an order of magnitude and maintain the tight correlation of the oxygen and neon abundances .",
    "when comparing the oxygen abundances from pne and h ii regions in a given galaxy , it is common to find a greater dispersion among the oxygen abundances from the pne . if this dispersion were only to lower values for the pne , it would be less worrisome , since pne arise from progenitors that were formed in the past , when metallicities were lower . however , it is also common to find many high values , above the mean observed for the local h ii regions .",
    "the oxygen abundances from fibre spectroscopy in m33 are the most extreme example , with pne having oxygen abundances in excess of the largest observed in its h ii regions , even when uncertainties are considered ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stasiska et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that the progenitors of bright pne synthesize oxygen .",
    "if so , they must also synthesize neon proportionately (  2 ) . as (",
    "* karakas & lattanzio ( 2003 ) ) point out , there is no reason that the progenitors of pne should synthesize oxygen and neon in the ratio observed in the interstellar medium in star - forming galaxies , which is set by the nucleosynthesis of type ii supernovae .",
    "while the progenitors of pne can synthesize oxygen and neon , the nucleosynthetic processes are different and , in the case of neon , a different isotope is produced .",
    "it is also possible that the analysis is incomplete and that the real uncertainties are underestimated . in the case of fibre spectroscopy of m33 ,",

    "finds weaker [ o ii ] @xmath133727 and stronger [ o iii ] @xmath135007 line intensities than fibre spectroscopy .",
    "this might be due to the difficulty of subtracting the diffuse ionized gas that pervades the discs of spirals from the fibre spectroscopy , since this ionized gas has strong [ o ii ] @xmath133727 and weak [ o iii ] @xmath135007 as compared with a typical pn spectrum .",
    "this needs further study so that the difference may be understood .",
    "a third concern is the uncertainty associated with chemical abundances . in the top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , most of the data points that nominally fall below the primordial helium abundance are compatible with this abundance , but some are not .",
    "presumably , this implies problems with the scheme to compute the total elemental abundance , likely the ionization correction factor employed to convert the observed ionic abundances into a total elemental abundance",
    ". it would be helpful to investigate what uncertainty the correction for unseen ionization stages introduces , for all elements .",
    "* delgado - inglada et al .",
    "( 2015 ) ) provide a very helpful introduction to this problem .",

    "* balick et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corradi et al . ( 2015 ) ) argue , it appears that a substantial fraction of the pne observed in the outer disc of m31 were not formed there , but that their progenitors were scattered to their current locations as a result of gravitational interactions between m31 and m33 . in m31",
    ", data exist for the resolved stellar content that leaves open this possibility . in most other galaxies , such data",
    "do not exist .",
    "if the progenitor stars of bright pne have masses of 2m@xmath5 , they live long enough that they may feel the evolution of their host galaxy , so it is important to keep this possibility in mind when interpreting results , e.g. , gradients in chemical abundances .",
    "the chemical abundances in bright pne in local spirals turn out to be somewhat less varied than their counterparts in dwarf galaxies .",
    "helium abundances are enriched by a modest amount , usually less than 50% with respect to the primordial value .",
    "nitrogen abundances span a wider range of enrichments than models are able to accomodate while preserving other abundance ratios , but type i pne are rare .",
    "oxygen and neon abundances are very strongly correlated and closely follow the relation observed between these elements in the interstellar medium in star - forming galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* izotov et al . 2006 ) ) . using models to interpret these results",
    ", we deduce that the progenitors of these bright pne have masses of about 2m@xmath5 or less , with the relation between oxygen and neon abundances providing the strongest constraint .",
    "if so , the progenitor stars of bright pne in local spirals live long enough that they _ will _ reflect the history of their host galaxies , including gravitational interactions with their neighbours .",
    "indeed , ensembles of bright pne in local spirals should be good probes of both the evolution of their progenitor stars and the recent history ( 1 - 2gyr ) of their galactic hosts ."
