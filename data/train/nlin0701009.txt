    "it is well - known that , when @xmath4 , the solutions of eq . with @xmath5 norm @xmath6",
    "such that @xmath7 is larger than a critical value @xmath8 may undergo collapse ( i.e. catastrophic formation of very sharp gradients and concentration phenomena for @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , when @xmath10 there can not be collapse @xcite .    in the context of the analysis of the propagation of kerr beams in layered optical media",
    "it was first explored the possibility that making the nonlinear coefficient @xmath11 to oscillate with the independent variable between values corresponding to the collapsing and expansion regimes could lead to collapse supresion @xcite .",
    "this idea was later explored @xcite in the same context and exported to the field of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "the stabilized structure was identified as a pulsating townes soliton after some rearrangement of initial data @xcite that is able to propagate without essential distortions for very large distances .",

    "the idea of stabilized solitons and nonlinearity management has also inspired some related mathematical research , with a focus on the averaged and collapse - preventing properties @xcite .",

    "@xmath17 is the ground state , also called the townes soliton , which plays an important role in the theory since @xmath8 sets a critical value for the norm below which collapse can not exist . due to the scaling symmetry of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ,",

    "the first two higher order stationary solutions with radial symmetry , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 calculated by using a standard shooting method , are depicted in fig . [ higher_order_solutions ] .",
    "all of our radially symmetric solutions to be presented in this paper have been computed by this method and then interpolated onto a two - dimensional rectangular grid .",
    "after this injection , we have used a newton relaxation method in order to increase the accuracy of the computed stationary solutions .",

    "however , as we are interested to extend these results to the full nonlinear equations , we must construct @xmath11 with an alternating sign because analytical results @xcite and computer simulations @xcite have revealed that this is a requirement to get stabilized solitons .",
    "using results from the quantum mechanical theory of fast perturbations @xcite we have chosen a set of parameters , @xmath51 , @xmath64 and @xmath28 for which the oscillating behavior of @xmath11 should maintain the profile of the excited solution in @xmath43 . moreover",
    ", this set of parameters leads to an stabilized townes soliton in component @xmath44 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ one - component_time_evolution ] we can see that although the maximum value of the amplitude exhibits oscillations related to the periodic modulation of @xmath11 , the norm remains constant which indicates that no radiation is emitted while the potential @xmath65 is switched from attractive to repulsive .",

    "( [ towlin ] ) .",
    "this situation is described by the case of @xmath67 , which means that the energy injected into the medium by the second component @xmath43 is much smaller in comparison with that of the first component @xmath44 @xcite .",

    "[ townes_equation ] , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , the potential experienced by @xmath43 includes this oscillation pattern .",
    "as the low frequency oscillations do not fulfill the requirements @xcite derived from the theory of fast perturbations , they lead to energy emission from the second component @xmath43 . the radiation emission is linked to the decreasing value of the @xmath43 norm : as the outgoing radiation hits the boundary of the computational domain it is removed by an absorbing potential .",
    "nevertheless , the first component evolves unperturbed as a stabilized townes soliton @xcite .",
    "+    the spatial intensity profile of the propagating beam @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "[ two - component1_time_evolution2 ] , has similar shape to the initial one ( see fig . [ higher_order_solutions ] ) .",
    "however , the maximum of the intensity distribution in fig .",
    "[ two - component1_time_evolution](b ) is about three times smaller than the corresponding value of the initial one due to the energy loss during the propagation .",
    "finally we turn on the nonlinear coupling in system ( [ nonlinear_system_2 ] ) by setting @xmath69 .",

    "@xmath43 reshape their transverse spatial profile by emitting energy . after a short propagation distance , @xmath70 , the excited solution losses its spatial shape , acquiring a profile which resembles to the townes soliton and which will be propagate along with the townes soliton .",
    "we may say that both initial profiles decay or readjust ( with energy loss ) their shape , eventually leading to the formation of nodeless stabilized vector solitons @xcite . nevertheless , for smaller values of @xmath39 , e.g. @xmath71",
    ", we recover the behaviour described in the previous subsection , with shape preservation accompanied by energy emission .",
    "we think that the mechanism described at the end of section [ one - component ] is responsable for the decay of component @xmath43 when the nonlinear coupling is large enough .",
    "the changes taking place in the component @xmath43 are then coupled back to component @xmath44 , which leads to energy emission , as seen by the decreasing norm of @xmath44 in figure [ two - component2_time_evolution ] .",
    "equation ( [ estacionaria ] ) has more solutions beyond those having radial symmetry .",
    "for instance , alfimov and coworkers @xcite , using branching - off techniques from the theory of dynamical systems constructed solutions having nontrivial discrete rotational symmetries .",
    "two examples of those solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ solutions_alfimov ] . in all of them",
    "we observe that a large central peak is surrounded by smaller ones having the prescribed discrete symmetry plus an outer ring .",
    "since these solutions are also unstable , their free propagation leads to collapse as shown in figs . [ nu3_free_evolution ] and [ nu4_free_evolution ] . since their norms are much above the critical one both solutions suffer a fast instability to collapse , the constant behavior of the norm indicating the fact that outgoing radiation waves have no time to escape from this system before the instability develops .",
    "the sensitivity of those configurations to collapse manifests itself in the fact that the instability distances are two orders of magnitude smaller than those of simpler solutions such as the townes , vortex or first radially excited solitons .",
    "we have tried to use the modulation of the nonlinear coefficient to stabilize the stationary solutions presented in fig .",
    "[ solutions_alfimov ] .",
    "however , the time evolution of the beam parameters does not change appreciably and in particular , the emergence of collapse can not be delayed .",
    "we have tried unsucessfully different sets of parameters to achieve stabilization .",
    "intuitively , it seems difficult to be able to stabilize those complicated structures because of the coexistence of different types of substructures ( peaks , rings , etc ) and the fact that their norm ar many times the critical one ( see the caption of fig . [ solutions_alfimov ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have complemented previous knowledge on stabilized solitons of the nonlinear schrdinger equation by studying numerically the possibility of stabilizing excited stationary solutions with radial symmetry in both ( i ) scalar and ( ii ) vectorial layered media .",
    "the scalar system is unable to stabilize radially excited states due to the internal dynamics , i.e. energy flow , of this state which leads to shorter stable propagation distances of the beam and collapse when compared with the propagation of the same beam through homogeneous media . in the case of vector layered media",
    "we have shown how weakly coupled beams when one of the components is chosen to be the townes soliton and the other an unstable radially excited solution can be stabilized .",
    "in this situation it is found that the radially excited state radiates continuously energy while preserving an intensity shape similar to the initial profile .    in both scalar and vectorial layered media ,",
    "the stabilization of solutions bearing nontrivial structure is difficult to achieve .",
    "this fact is due to the ireversibility of the internal energy flows between the wave substructures , e.g. rings , peaks , during propagation .",
    "additional stabilizing mechanisms , like spatially inhomogeneous nonlinearities depending on the transverse variables , might help in stabilizing states with nontrivial structures as it happens in the case of non - oscillating structures @xcite .    finally , we have tried unsuccesfully to stabilize complex asymmetric solutions of eq .",
