    "two - dimensional self - avoiding walks with additional generic short - range attraction are believed to experience a collapse transition as the temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature phase is in the universality class of ordinary self - avoiding walks ( saws ) , also known as _ dilute polymers _",
    ", with well - known exponents .",
    "the low - temperature phase is in the universality class of so - called _ dense polymers _ , also with well - known exponents @xcite . in between",
    "sits the so - called _ theta point _",
    ", where the polymers are somewhat more compact than in the dilute phase , but still have a fractal dimension strictly smaller than two .",
    "the theta point is well identified in the language of the o(@xmath0 ) field theory ( in the polymer limit @xmath3 ) as a tricritical point @xcite , while the ordinary saws correspond to the usual critical point .",
    "non - generic attraction between monomers would lead to higher criticality for the transition point , leading to what is sometimes called a _",
    "theta prime _",
    "point @xcite .",
    "it is unfortunately difficult to identify ` the ' theta point based on its expected tricritical nature . when dealing with geometrical problems , the counting of physical observables",
    " many of which are , in a sense , non - local is ambiguous .",
    "moreover , in two dimensions , the landau - ginzburg picture is hardly able to organise the zoo of known universality classes , which is rendered even more complicated by the lack of unitarity inherent to geometrical problems .",
    "finally , producing reliable numerical results turns out unexpectedly hard .",
    "this means the identification of the theta point critical exponents has led to a long - standing controversy .    in 1987 ,",
    "duplantier and saleur @xcite were able to solve exactly a model ( first proposed by coniglio et al .",
    "@xcite ) of saws on the honeycomb lattice with a particular type of attractive interaction .",
    "they conjectured that this interaction was generic enough to put the model in the theta universality class , and obtained the exponents @xmath4 later , the same authors @xcite carried out extensive numerical simulations to explore the stability of their conjectured theta point against additional attractions , and concluded that indeed , the exponents they had obtained described the generic ( tricritical ) theta point .",
    "these exponents were also found in agreement with numerical simulations of interacting self - avoiding walks on other lattices @xcite , but it is fair to say that the proximity of the dense phase with very strong corrections to scaling rendered these results a little less definite than one would have liked . for the square lattice and presumably generic nearest - neighbour attractions ,",
    "the best recent numerical results are @xcite @xmath5 meanwhile , in a beautiful series of papers @xcite , nienhuis and collaborators managed to find an exactly solvable o(@xmath0 ) model on the square lattice with a rich set of phase transitions .",
    "one of these has , for @xmath6 , all the required characteristics of the theta point , but leads , disturbingly , to critical exponents which are different from those of @xcite : @xmath7 it was suggested at the time in @xcite that this solvable point might be in fact ` the ' generic theta point , implying that the point obtained by duplantier and saleur @xcite was , in fact , a higher multicritical point - although it is hard to see how the exponent @xmath8 in ( [ expods ] ) for a higher multicritical point could be larger than the one ( [ exponien ] ) for the generic theta point .    to complicate the matters further , the exponents obtained in @xcite , despite the impeccable derivation obtained via the bethe ansatz , have never quite been observed in numerical simulations .",
    "frustratingly , for the very model discussed in @xcite , and using the most state - of - the - art numerical techniques available today , the exponents obtained in direct simulations @xcite read @xmath9 and are , bizarrely , close to the ones ( [ expods ] ) obtained by duplantier saleur !",
    "similar conclusions were drawn in @xcite in the context of the measure of surface critical exponents , both from transfer matrix and dmrg calculations .",
    "the discrepancy with respect to the analytical results ( [ exponien ] ) is essentially unheard of in the field of exactly solvable models and conformal field theory in two dimensions , where , usually , theory and numerical experiments match almost perfectly . for hamiltonian walks on the square lattice",
    "was found numerically to be @xcite @xmath10 , in perfect agreement with the subsequent analytical solution @xcite @xmath11 .",
    "] of course , one important point is that in @xcite , the quantities which are studied involve a grand canonical ensemble of walks where the length fluctuates , while in the simulations of @xcite polymers have a fixed length , and the ensemble is canonical .",
    "however , this point is usually easily taken care of by considerations of legendre transform , and has never , in all the other cases studied so far , led to any particular difficulty .    while evidence gathered over the last many years ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent contributions )",
    "has confirmed that the exponents obtained in @xcite indeed are those of the generic theta point , the meaning of the exactly solved model in @xcite has remained totally unclear : what is its universality class in the o(@xmath0 ) field theory language",
    "? why are the exponents so hard to observe numerically ?",
    "the detailed answer to this question is the object of this paper and turns out to be a rather long story .",
    "it can however be summarised rather succinctly : the universality class of the model in @xcite is profoundly different from the one of ordinary saws . while for the latter",
    ", the spectrum of critical exponents is _",
    "discrete_as is the case for most familiar models of statistical mechanics  for the former , the critical exponents form in fact a _ continuum _ , of which the values ( [ exponien ] ) obtained in @xcite are simply the lower bounds .",
    "while , as we shall see below , this explains the numerical difficulties encountered so far , it also shows that the continuum field theoretic description is profoundly different from the o(@xmath6 ) model @xmath12 theory expected for the theta point .",
    "the field theoretic description instead involves a non - compact target , and is related with the _ black hole sigma model _",
    "conformal field theory that has been discussed intensively in the string theory literature @xcite .",
    "the model considered in @xcite is one of a single polymer on the square lattice , where edges can be visited at most once .",
    "the polymer is not allowed to cross itself , but collisions where two pieces of the polymer barely avoid each other are allowed at all sites : an energy @xmath13 is associated to this in order to take into account the presence of medium - range attractions in the physics of the theta point ( see figure [ fig : visawconfig ] ) .",
    "additionally , it is convenient to also allow for some stiffness , and thus associate with two parallel consecutive monomers an energy @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting object is called a semi - flexible visaw ( vertex - interacting self - avoiding walk ) , in the notations of @xcite that we follow here .",
    "the partition function of a polymer made of @xmath15 monomers is thus given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . while monte carlo simulations focus on polymers of fixed large length @xmath15 , the integrable model deals instead with a grand canonical ensemble where the monomers have a fugacity @xmath19 , so the partition function is @xmath20    in 0,1,2,3,4,5,5 ( , 0 ) ",

    "this is indeed the value expected for the theta point .",
    "it is now interesting to consider what happens near @xmath289 .",
    "first , the leading eigenvalue of the transfer matrix takes the form @xmath291 where @xmath292 is _ independent of @xmath287 _ , and there are no corrections of order @xmath293 because we use periodic boundary conditions . when @xmath294 , loops that wind around the axis of the cylinder are allowed , with fugacity @xmath295 .",

    "comparing , we find the result @xmath306 the left hand side combination can be considered as a sort of second virial coefficient @xcite .",
    "such terms are not particularly inspiring in general .",
    "what is remarkable here is that this difference is _",
    "positive_. this is related to the positive curvature of the second line of ( [ centchform ] ) for the central charge as a function of @xmath287 . in models of polymers ,",
    "such a term is usually negative , like in the first line of ( [ centchform ] ) , leading to the opposite sign for the combination of partition functions ( [ partcomb ] ) .",
    "it is easy to understand why such a term is negative for instance for ordinary self avoiding walks : the point is that every term in @xmath305 occurs also in @xmath307 , while there are plenty of terms in @xmath307 that are not in @xmath305all the terms where two non - contractible loop from each of the @xmath304 have a non - zero overlap .",
    "when the model involves bending and attraction , it is not so easy to establish the sign of this term before hand .",
    "for instance , there are terms in @xmath305 where two non - contractible loops are close to each other , contributing a mutual attraction energy which is not present in the corresponding ( geometrically identical ) term subtracted in @xmath307 .",
    "nonetheless , in all models known to us  in particular the theta point @xmath2the combination remains negative .",
    "the fact that it is positive in our case indicates the attraction between monomers at the @xmath1 point is unusually strong , a significant fact confirming the belief that @xmath1 is a higher order critical point .",
    "to proceed , we make the simple but crucial observation that the radius of the compact boson for a given value of @xmath79that is , for a given value of the fugacity of contractible loops  in regime iii is the _ same _ as the radius for the compact boson describing the corresponding dense phase of the vertex or o(@xmath0 ) model .",
    "the dense phase of the vertex model is obtained by increasing the fugacity @xmath19 of the monomers in the loop version of the problem , and is in the same universality class as the `` completely packed '' model , which is nothing but the ordinary six - vertex model .",
    "the corresponding dense phase of the o(@xmath0 ) model is obtained in the same way , the only difference being that non - contractible loops get fugacity @xmath0 , instead of two for the vertex model .",
    "this observation can be illustrated by considering the polymer case ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the @xmath154-leg ( watermelon ) exponents are found to be @xcite @xmath308 while they are @xmath309 in the case of dense polymers .",
    "these two formulas are quite close , since @xmath310 the identical @xmath311 term arises from the fact that both theories involve the same compact boson .",
    "the shift of @xmath312 occurs because of the non - compact boson .",
    "more precisely , the scaling of the associated eigenvalue in the dense polymer case @xmath313 involves @xmath314 with @xmath315 for dense polymers , while we have for our critical point @xmath316 here , @xmath317 denotes the central charge of one boson , while @xmath318 is the central charge of a system of one compact and one non - compact boson  or the effective central charge of the black hole theory .",
    "we see therefore that if we took the leading eigenvalue in the @xmath154-leg sector and made the non - compact boson massive , the scaling would simply evolve from our model to the dense polymer case : @xmath319 meanwhile , we also notice that the central charge ( that is , the scaling for the ground state energy ) is given in our model by a discrete state , which involves the non - compact boson .",
    "recall indeed the general formula ( [ centchform ] ) in our case for a twist @xmath287 .",
    "we must take @xmath289 to make the weight of non - contractible loops equal to zero , which leads to @xmath197 , while @xmath320 .",

    "we see that , if we made the non - compact boson massive while leaving the compact one untouched , the discrete level would disappear , and the value of the central charge would become @xmath323 as required for dense polymers .",

    "these observations strongly suggest that _ the non - compact degree of freedom is associated with fluctuations of monomer density _ , since these fluctuations become non - critical precisely when the non - compact degree of freedom disappears .",
    "this is , after all , not so surprising .",
    "the emergence of a compact boson in the continuum limit of the six - vertex model follows from the reformulation in terms of a model of heights defined on the dual lattice , with heights on neighbouring sites defined recursively by the orientation of the arrows separating them .",
    "study of the rg flow shows that the dynamics of these heights is described by a free bosonic theory .",
    "this theory is compactified because , on a torus , the periodicity of the heights can not be guaranteed , and the boson much be identified with its shifts by @xmath339 @xcite . in _",

    "the ik model ) also admits edges that do not carry an arrow . in the regime",
    "i of the ik model , these edges do not have much implication on the continuum limit , as they simply lead to a renormalisation of the effective coupling constant ( radius ) of the free boson ; the physics is essentially the same as the one of the dense model .",
    "it is however perfectly possible to imagine a scenario where the continuum limit of the theory is more complicated , and , while the arrow - carrying edges still correspond to height jumps in a height model with a dynamics described by a free boson at large scales , the arrow - free edges correspond to some additional non - trivial degrees of freedom in the continuum limit .",
    "this is in fact exactly what happens in regime ii , where these edges are related with the emergence of an ising degree of freedom in the continuum limit .",
    "what we propose now is that the edges that do not carry an arrow  and which correspond , in the loop model , to edges not carrying a monomer  have a dynamics described in the continuum limit by a non - compact boson .",
    "note that , since the total number of edges on the lattice is of course a constant , the number of empty edges and number of monomer - carrying edges are related .",
    "this means that , in a certain sense , the dynamics of the density at the critical point of regime iii should be related with the non - compact degree of freedom .",
    "it is now time to recall a few facts about the black hole sigma model which , according to our earlier work @xcite , describes the critical @xmath63 model in regime iii .",
    "as discussed in the foregoing sections , the question of the _ twist _ plays an important role .",

    "the action reads ( for simplicity we do not write the dilaton term ) @xmath341 and describes a sigma model on a target with the shape of a cigar .",

    "there are some crucial subtleties here having to do with normalisability , and the best way to understand them is to discuss briefly the mini - superspace approximation @xcite .",
    "physically , this is obtained by considering the model on a cylinder of very tiny radius , so that fluctuations in one direction can be neglected , and the model becomes effectively a zero - dimensional quantum mechanics problem .",

    "we conclude with the natural result that , to lowest order in the density , we have indeed that the monomer density is proportional to @xmath411 .",
    "the analysis of the perturbations from the black hole cft at @xmath1 into the dense and massive phases can , at first sight , be extended to the perturbation along the multicritical line ( the violet line in the phase diagram of figure [ fig : phasediagram ] ) .",
    "but while it is very natural to expect that this perturbation is relevant ( and thus that there is a flow away from @xmath1 in all directions of the phase diagram in figure [ fig : phasediagram ] ) , the numerical evidence for this scenario is disappointing .    of course , investigating the critical behaviour along the multicritical line is a very complicated task .",
    "the precise location of the multicritical points away from @xmath1 and @xmath2 is unknown , and numerical estimations of critical exponents are plagued by the flow towards the dense or massive phases , as well as the proximity with the ising or dilute critical surfaces . at this stage , we feel that an exploration of the phase diagram with conclusive numerical results is beyond the scope of this work . here , we will content ourselves by investigating a much simpler question , namely what happens to the non - compact boson precisely at @xmath2 .",
    "this can be done by following continuously the levels @xmath160 from @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we restrict for simplicity to the twisted case , where non - contractible loops have weight @xmath0 .    before doing so , it is useful to recall a few results about the physics at the point @xmath2 .",
    "the latter belongs to a more general integrable line labeled ` branch 0 ' in @xcite , and which was solved exactly by bethe ansatz in @xcite .",
    "most of the results can actually be derived from the observation ( reviewed above in section  [ sec:2 ] ) that the configurations of the model with weights @xmath412 can be mapped onto the configurations of completely packed loops with weights @xmath413 , or equivalently , onto a @xmath414 state potts model .",
    "the latter model is critical for @xmath415 , and well understood from a coulomb gas construction @xcite : the continuum limit is described by a compact boson , and parametrizing @xmath416 the central charge reads @xmath417 where @xmath418 is related to the weight @xmath419 of non - contractible completely packed loops by @xmath420 . in particular , for the ` pure loop ' case where contractible and non - contractible loops have the same weight , @xmath421 so that @xmath422 the point @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath27 , that is @xmath423 , and so @xmath197 . turning to the critical exponents , they read @xmath424 that is , at @xmath2 , @xmath425    we now come back to the levels @xmath160 .",
    "contrarily to what was observed in the case of @xmath19 perturbations , these appear to remain critical at @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we have studied in detail the first few levels @xmath336 in the sector of zero magnetisation .",
    "the following observations hold :    * @xmath426 is still the ground state at @xmath2 ( there is no level crossing ) ; * @xmath427 has at @xmath2 the conformal weight @xmath428 ; * @xmath429 has at @xmath2 the conformal weight @xmath430 .    from these observations",
    "it is quite natural to conjecture that the levels @xmath336 become degenerate with the magnetic excitations of the compact boson at @xmath2 , namely @xmath431    it is easy to imagine scenarios where the non - compact boson becomes massive , and the compact boson keeps its radius ( as in the flow to the dense phase ) , or acquires a new value of the radius .",
    "it is also possible to imagine scenarios involving the emergence of ising degrees of freedom , as observed on the blue surface in figure [ fig : phasediagram]this would simply correspond , in the complex field picture , to the introduction of an additional gauge field @xcite .",
    "but we can not , for now , imagine a simple scenario connecting highly degenerate conformal weights at the @xmath2 point to the continuum of weights at the @xmath1 point .",
    "this will have to wait for further studies .",
    "incidentally , this will require , in particular , furthering our understanding of the physics in the @xmath24 plane @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have partly unraveled the mystery of the theta point in two dimensions . we have established that the bn point found in @xcite is very peculiar from the point of view of critical systems : its correlation functions do not decay as discrete sums of power laws at large distance , but involve instead a _ continuum of critical exponents_. this is expected to lead to extremely strong corrections to scaling , and explains why the results of numerical simulations have always been ` off ' compared to the well - established theoretical values .",
    "we have also seen that the bn point is _ extremely unstable _ , and represents , in a certain sense , an infinite order of criticality .",
    "we note that these features are somewhat similar to the ones of the theta point for interacting trails . as discussed in @xcite , this point",
    "is described also by a non - compact cft , albeit of a rather trivial type ( a goldstone phase sigma model , free at low energy @xcite ) , with trivial critical exponents .",
    "one question that we have unfortunately not been able to fully answer is the role of the @xmath1 point in the phase diagram of polymers .",
    "we still believe that the point @xmath2 is the tricritical point for generic lattices and short distance interactions",
    ". it may be that it is _ also _ the generic tricritical point for the model we discuss in this paper , where loops osculate at the vertices ( with weight @xmath22 , see figure  [ fig : visawconfig ] ) .",
    "this is what conventional thinking would suggest , since the critical theory at the @xmath1 point involves an infinity of relevant operators .",
    "moreover , it is certainly difficult to imagine a flow from @xmath2essentially described by a single boson  to @xmath1 , which involves so many more degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not seen convincing numerical evidence for this flow . on top of this",
    ", it turns out that , for the model in figure [ fig : visawconfig ] , the solvable point with universality class of @xmath2 enjoys an additional symmetry , which is broken as soon as ` straight segments ' are allowed : the number of monomers on the even sub lattice minus the number of monomers on the odd sub lattice is indeed conserved by the interactions .",
    "this means , in fact , that the model enjoys an underlying @xmath432 symmetry , larger than the @xmath63 symmetry present in the rest of the phase diagram @xcite . from this point of view , it is tempting to expect that there is an rg flow towards @xmath1 , which was suggested in the original paper @xcite .",
    "but we have not seen clear numerical evidence for this either .",
    "it could be that there is a  yet unidentified  intermediate fixed point making these observations compatible .",
    "we hope to be able to report on this soon .",
