    "there are several reasons for studying qcd in curved spacetimes .",
    "one is the possibility of the existence of dense quark matter at the core of a neutron star@xcite .",
    "although perturbative qcd works well at very high densities ( large quark chemical potential @xmath0 ) where the quark matter is predicted to be in color - flavor - locked phase(cfl)@xcite , we do nt have the same confidence in the regime intermediate between the hadronic phase and the cfl phase ( called non - cfl phase ) .",
    "in this regime , we expect a strongly coupled qcd .",
    "further , due to the extreme density involved , the effects of spacetime curvature can not be neglected .",
    "hence , a proper treatment of this regime needs the full treatment of non - perturbative qcd method in curved spacetime .",
    "this is the major motivation of this work .",
    "we want a lattice qcd that is valid for curved spacetimes .",
    "this paper also partially addresses the question of the possibility of qcd deconfinement in a curved spacetime .",
    "there are several reasons for considering this question",
    ". 1 . ) in curved spacetime formulation of qft , the metric enters non - trivially in the action : contraction of vector indices , christoffel and spin connections and in covariant derivatives of vector bosons . because of this , one might ask : will the linear - in - separation potential between two colors in flat spacetime get modified in curved spacetime ?",
    "is it possible to find a metric @xmath1 that will significantly modify this potential so that it will lead to deconfinement ? 2 . ) as pointed - out by @xcite , in flat spacetime , qcd undergoes a confining - deconfining phase transition at high temperatures",
    ". however spacetime curvature can play the role of temperature@xcite . in blackholes , for example",
    ", the temperature is inversely proportional to the surface gravity @xcite .",
    "in fact , using the quark condensate as the order parameter in nambu - jona - lasinio model , it was shown that there can be deconfinement just outside the blackhole horizon.@xcite 3 . )",
    "spacetime curvature can lead to particle creation . for large curvatures ,",
    "the quark - gluon plasma created might screen the color flux leading to deconfinement .    from these considerations ,",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the effects of gravity on qcd confinement .    due to the complexity of the problem",
    ", investigations usually proceed by using a simpler model .",
    "for example , @xcite uses the schwinger model in mock schwarzschild metric in 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "however , this model did not resolve the problem . as the author himself pointed out",
    ", the model has many shortcomings : 1 . ) the schwinger model in flat spacetime is confining even at high temperatures 2 . )",
    "it uses an abelian gauge field and 3 . )",
    "it is superrenormalizable .",
    "some papers@xcite use a phenomenological model wherein a dilaton is coupled to gluodynamics to investigate the problem and they were able to derive the cornell potential@xcite between the quark - antiquark pair",
    ". however , these papers restricted their treatment to the weak coupling limit . also , the coupling to dilaton means that their approach focused on the effect of quantum gravity instead of the classical curved spacetime background to confinement , which is the concern of the current paper .",
    "vasihoun et .",
    "al . investigated the effects of gravity and topology on non - linear gauge field theory.@xcite they have shown that there can be charge hidingin a wormhole throat . when coupled to a dilaton",
    ", they found confinement - deconfinement effect as a functions of dilaton vev .",
    "we must also mention that in the literature , there are other motivations for studying qcd in curved spacetime .",
    "for example , it can be used as a mathematical trick to track the symmetries by introducing a new field@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the gluons are coupled to the dilaton , and the following duality was obtained : classical gluodynamics in curved conformal spacetime backgrounds @xmath2 gluodynamics in flat spaetime coupled to scalar glueballs .",
    "sasagawa and tanaka are concerned with the direct effect of gravity on qcd@xcite .",
    "they investigated the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions in curved spacetimes with @xmath3 and @xmath4 topology .",
    "this has been done by using the nambu - jona - lasinio model with the dressed polyakov loop as the order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "their paper is concerned with the effect of gravity on the difference between chiral and deconfinement transition temperatures .    in",
    "flat spacetime , lattice gauge theory(lgt ) has successfully dealt with color confinement which is a non - perturbative strong - coupling phenomenon .",
    "one obstacle to extending lgt to curved - spacetime qcd problems is the need to derive the correct generally covariant form of the action when the continuum limit is taken . in this paper",
    ", we will show that a simple generalization of the link and plaquette variables will produce the correct action in the continuum limit . for the quark field , this is done by discretizing the generally - covariant dirac equation and solving the resulting propagator .",
    "just as in the flat spacetime case , we will perform a wick rotation in the time coordinate @xmath5 so that the metric will be euclidean . + the link variable can be defined in curved spacetime by inserting the metric in appropriate places @xmath6 where the @xmath7 labels the direction of transport , @xmath8 is the coupling , @xmath1 is the metric , @xmath9 is the matrix gauge field and @xmath10 is an infinitesimal displacement .",
    "+ for color transport at finite distance @xmath11 to @xmath12 , the link variable is the path - ordered product of eq.(2.1 ) @xmath13\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some specified path @xmath14 .",
    "+ it can be seen that taking the adjoint produces the reversed - path color transport .    under the gauge transformation of the gauge field",
    "@xmath15 the link variable changes as @xmath16 to show this , we used the expansion @xmath17 and the fact that @xmath18 is infinitesimal so that @xmath19 can be ignored .",
    "+ with this definition of link variables , the plaquette operator can now be defined in an analogous manner with the flat spacetime case    @xmath20    the main differences are the presence of the metric and the covariant derivatives when the exponents of the link variables are expanded .",
    "for example , one leg of the plaquette has an associated link variable @xmath21 where in the last line the metric and the gauge field are functions only of @xmath11 .",
    "eq.(2.7 ) was obtained from eq.(2.6 ) by expanding @xmath22 and @xmath23 in powers of @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath24 carries a contravariant vector index so that in curved spacetime , one must take the full covariant derivative @xmath25 instead of just a simple partial derivative as is done in minkowski spacetime .",
    "we also used the fact that the covariant derivative of the metric vanishes .    using the gauge transformation of the link variable eq.(2.4 ) and",
    "the cyclic property of the trace it can be seen that the trace of the plaquette operator is gauge - invariant @xmath26 we can combine the exponentials in eq.(2.5 ) by using the identity @xmath27+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot}$ ] repeatedly and obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the generally - covariant field - strength tensor @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "+ the wilson action can now be formed from the plaquette operators just as in the flat spacetime case . + for simplicity , consider first the plaquette form by four vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "consider now the expression @xmath33=-a^4\\mbox{tr}[f^{12}f_{12 } ] + \\mbox{constant}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the _ physical _ distance @xmath35 which we take to be constant along any side of a plaquette ( @xmath18 and @xmath36 are _ coordinate _ distance ) .",
    "+ note that the right - hand side of the equation above has a similar form with that of the kinetic term of the gauge field @xmath37 . to get this full kinetic term , sum eq.(2.10 ) over all possible plaquettes @xmath38 where we split the sum over all plaquettes into two parts : for each lattice site , sum over all directions , then sum over all lattice sites .",
    "the former produces the summation of the indices of the field - strength tensor @xmath37 . in the limit @xmath39",
    ", the summation over the lattice sites yields @xmath40 where @xmath41det@xmath42 .",
    "hence in this limit we have @xmath43=-\\lambda^2\\int\\mbox{d}^4x\\sqrt{g}f^{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right - hand side of the above equation is the covariant form of the kinetic term of the gauge field appropriate for curved spacetimes . hence we can take the left - hand side expression as the appropriate wilson action for curved spacetime . +",
    "since @xmath44 simply reverses the direction the plaquette is traversed , we can write the wilson action as @xmath45 where the sum includes both orientations of the plaquettes . + eq.(2.14 ) can be useful for numerical simulations of lattice qcd in a curved spacetime .",
    "however , even without doing such numerical calculation , it is possible to extract an interesting result from the wilson action above : it can be shown that for _ any _ metric , a pair of gluons are always color - confined .",
    "this will be shown in the next section .      from the definition of the link variable eq.(2.1 ) or ( 2.2 ) , it is not difficult to show that the relevant integral formulas @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 etc .",
    "remain true even in this curved spacetime formalism .",
    "+ since the usual integral formulas hold , we can the argue the following : for a wilson loop @xmath49 of dimension @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the wick - rotated time ) , the non - vanishing contribution to the path integral @xmath52 expanded in the strong - coupling limit in powers of @xmath53 , is the configuration where the wilson loop s interior is filled with plaquettes . + since each plaquette contributes a factor @xmath53 and there are @xmath54 plaquettes inside the loop , we have @xmath55 this result shows a potential that is linear with separation @xmath56 and hence implies a color - confined glue - ball . note",
    "that this result is true for a general metric including blackholes",
    ". + also , the result ( 3.2 ) is consistent with the cornell potential @xcite except for the absence of the yukawa potential which describes the color - coulomb interaction of quarks .",
    "this is because we ignored the fermionic quarks in our calculation . +",
    "this result is also consistent with the t hooft relation with @xmath57 as the coefficient of the dielectric term@xcite .",
    "the presence of the scale @xmath34 means that the confinement phenomenon breaks scale invariance just as in the flat case@xcite .",
    "in section 2 , we have written down the appropriate wilson action for gluons in a curved spacetime . to complete the theoretical foundation of lattice gauge theory in a curved background ,",
    "one also needs to write an appropriate lattice action for the quarks ( wilson fermions ) .    in curved spacetime",
    ", the dirac equation is written as@xcite @xmath58 from here on , the first few greek letters ( @xmath59 ... ) denote vector indices in a local inertial frame while the middle letters ( @xmath60 ... ) denote vector indices in a general coordinate frame .",
    "this means that @xmath61 and @xmath62 will be raised and lowered by the minkowski metric @xmath63 while @xmath0 and @xmath64 by the general metric @xmath42 .",
    "the matrices @xmath65 in eq.(4.1 ) are therefore the usual dirac matrices in flat spacetime .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath66 acting on the dirac spinor @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where the spin connection is given by @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the vierbien and @xmath71 $ ] are the generators of lorentz transformations in spinor representation .    as is usual",
    ", we will perform a wick rotation before discretization : @xmath5 and @xmath72 .",
    "this changes the dirac equation into @xmath73 the generators change to @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 $ ] while the vierbiens are unchanged .",
    "the discretization proceeds as usual : replace the derivatives by finite differences .",
    "the dirac equation in matrix form becomes @xmath76+m_q\\delta_{m , n}\\bigg\\}\\psi_m=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in this notation @xmath77 and same goes for the spin connection and the vierbien .",
    "if we include the coupling of the quarks with the gluons , eq.(4.3 ) yields the propagator @xmath78\\nonumber\\\\ & { } & { } + \\big(g^{\\mu\\nu}_n\\gamma_{\\alpha}v^{\\alpha}_{\\mu n}\\gamma_{\\nu n}+g^{\\mu\\nu}_n\\gamma_{\\alpha}v^{\\alpha}_{\\mu n}iga_{\\nu n}+m_q\\big)\\delta_{m , n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the quark - gluon coupling terms are modified by the insertion of the factor @xmath79 while the mass term is modified into an effective massterm @xmath80 , each has a non - trivial dependence on @xmath81 .",
    "the path - integral for the wilson fermion is then given by @xmath82 the fermion fields is usually integrated to yield the effective action @xmath83=s_0[a]-\\mbox{tr}\\mbox{ln } g^{-1}(u , a)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 $ ] is the action for gluons . +",
    "this equation can be used as a starting point for numerical simulations .",
    "the computation of the last term might be slow but there are methods to handle this.@xcite      it is well - known that lattice gauge theories typically suffer from the fermion - doubling problem .",
    "this happens when the propagator has an extra pole that falls within the brillouin zone .",
    "for the propagator in eq.(3.4 ) , whether this pole exist depends in general on the geometry of the background spacetime @xmath42 .",
    "in this section , we consider the special case of friedman - robertson - walker(frw ) metric to investigate the fermion - doubling problem for lattice qcd in curved spacetime .",
    "+ for this case , it is more convenient to use the convention @xmath85 for the spacetime signature so that the propertime element is given by d@xmath86d@xmath87(d@xmath88d@xmath89d@xmath90 ) .",
    "since the time variable @xmath91 appears in the function @xmath92 , it is more convenient to apply wick rotation on the spatial part @xmath93 .",
    "the propertime now has a euclidean signature d@xmath86d@xmath94(d@xmath88d@xmath89d@xmath90 ) .",
    "accordingly , we must also rotate the gamma matrix @xmath95 where a hat in the index zero means that it is a local frame index . the dirac equation in curved spacetime",
    "then becomes @xmath96 following the discretization done in section 3.1 , the propagator becomes @xmath97-m\\delta_{n , m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fourier transform of the above is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the volume of our ( finite ) lattice .",
    "note that getting the continuum limit @xmath39 , eq.(3.9 ) gives an alternative approach to obtain the momentum - space propagator for fermions in curved spacetime @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "let us consider the specific orthonormal basis whose coordinate components are given by @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the vierbein is then diag@xmath107 .",
    "it can be shown that in this metric , all the spin connection components vanish @xmath108 .",
    "let us now investigate the zeros of @xmath109 which we write as @xmath110 where @xmath111 to get eq.(3.12 ) we multiplied eq.(3.11 ) by @xmath112 and used the identity @xmath113 .    for the purpose of illustrating fermion - doubling ,",
    "let us consider the massless case @xmath114 .",
    "eq.(3.12 ) then simplifies to @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 . for a vacuum dominated universe at large times @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the hubble constant , and we have @xmath121 eq.(3.14 ) then reduces to @xmath122 which has a solution @xmath123 at the boundary of the 4-dimensional brilluoin zone",
    "note that if we interpret @xmath124 as energy , then this solution looks like a flat band inside the 3-dimensional @xmath125-space brilluoin zone .",
    "this specific example shows that the fermion - doubling problem can occur in the lattice gauge theory in curved spacetime . due to the non - trivial appearance of the factors like @xmath42 , @xmath70 and @xmath126",
    "however , the doubling of the fermions depends on the specific spacetime geometry under consideration .",
    "in this paper , it was shown that a lattice gauge theory can be consistently formulated in curved spacetime background .",

    "this result does not use any effective low - energy model and is valid for any bakcground geometry including blakchole spacetime .",
    "primordial blackholes therefore , do not radiate free gluons .",
