    "the experimental and theoretical study of carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) has recently been active because these low dimensional materials display interesting properties both from a fundamental physics and applications view point .",
    "the mechanical strength of cnt combined with their rich electronic properties have led to demonstrations of their application as stm tips @xcite , field emission sources @xcite and nanoscale devices @xcite .",
    "cnt can presently be cut to lengths varying from tens of a nanometer to a many microns , and experiments have shown promise as molecular wires @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "studies of the conductance of cnt with single defects and a junction between tubes have generated interest @xcite , as has the low energy excitation spectrum in the presence of electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "a metallic cnt has two propagating subbands at the fermi energy .",
    "this can yield a maximum low bias conductance of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the prospect of realizing conductances close to @xmath1 will significantly depend on ( i ) the role of disorder / defects in reducing the conductance of this low dimensional material and ( ii ) ability to realize near perfect contacts with macroscopic sized voltage pads . using numerical simulation",
    ", we study the effect of two types of disorder .",
    "the first type of disorder is a relatively weak uniform disorder that is distributed throughout the sample .",
    "this model has been considered previously in different contexts @xcite .",
    "the second type of disorder is isolated strong scatterers .",
    "these scatterers physically correspond to lattice sites onto which an electron can not hop easily .",
    "we find that the two types of disorder affect the conductance in very different manners .",
    "we present the results of our conductance calculations in nanotubes of different lengths and diameters .",
    "we also make suggestions to observe some of these results experimentally .",
    "the second contribution of our paper is a procedure that can be used for the numerical computation of the transport properties of cnt with defects , t , y and other junctions @xcite and cnt - heterostructures .",
    "our procedure includes the effect of semi infinite leads in an efficient manner . the green s function based transport formulation of refs .",
    "@xcite is employed and is applicable to devices with arbitrary disordered regions and junctions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the model and the green s function method in section ii .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the numerical results in section iii .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "the electronic properties of cnt have been calculated in the context of various approximations .",
    "we use the simplest model which assumes the nanotube to be an @xmath3 bonded network .",
    "the corresponding single particle hamiltonian is @xcite , @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the on - site potential and @xmath6 is the hopping parameter between lattice sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath7 . in the absence of defects ,",
    "the on - site potential @xmath5 is zero and the hopping parameter is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we calculate the conductance of a structure that consists of two semi - infinite perfect cnt leads separated by a region with defects ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in the presence of defects , both the on - site potential and the hopping parameter change . here",
    ", we only consider the variation in the on - site potential , @xmath11 in the case of a uniformly distributed weak disorder , @xmath12 is randomly chosen from the interval @xmath13 corresponds to increasing the amount of disorder . in the case of substitutional defects",
    ", @xmath14 is set to a large number at some random lattice sites . in a real sample",
    ", @xmath15 would be expected to have a finite spatial extent . in this paper , the finite spatial extent is neglected and the random component is treated as a delta function potential .",
    "the transmission coefficient between the left and right leads is calculated using the expression @xcite , @xmath16 the coupling of the device to the left and right leads , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the green s function matrix of the @xmath22th semi infinite lead , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the retarded and advanced green s function matrices of the device ( including the coupling to the semi infinite leads ) , and @xmath25 is the matrix that couples the @xmath22th lead to device ( disordered ) region .",
    "the trace is over the device nodes . to obtain the green s functions , we solve the following equation , @xmath26 where",
    ", @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) represents the self energy due to the semi infinite leads and @xmath29 is the identity matrix of dimension equal to the number of device lattice sites . in general for a structure with @xmath30 atoms , solving for all elements of the green s function involves inverting a @xmath31 matrix .",
    "computational resources limit the size of the system that can be considered .",
    "however , by careful ordering of lattice sites the matrix corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gr ] ) is block tridiagonal [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat ] ) ] : @xmath32 for this purpose we divide the structure into smaller units , each unit typically representing one / few rings of atoms along the circumference of the tube .",
    "the diagonal submatrix @xmath33 ( dimension of @xmath34 ) represents @xmath35 of the @xmath7th unit and the off diagonal submatrix @xmath36 ( dimension of @xmath37 ) represents the coupling between units @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the number of sites in units @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath40 are empty matrices . in the near neighbor",
    "tight binding scheme , @xmath36 is non zero only when @xmath41 .",
    "hence , a block tridiagonal structure for eq .",
    "( [ eq : gr ] ) . calculating",
    "the phase coherent transmission coefficient involves only the off diagonal component of the green s function connecting the left and right ends of the device ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this further reduces the labor to compute the transmission coefficient .",
    "we solve for @xmath42 by using an efficient block tridiagonal elimination procedure . using this procedure , we are able to calculate the transmission coefficient through long disordered regions .",
    "the green s function @xmath43 is calculated via an iterative procedure @xcite .",
    "the matrix equation corresponding to the semi infinite leads is the same as eq .",

    "note that in the present work , we calculate only the phase coherent transmission coefficient ( the effect of electron - phonon interaction is neglected ) and that temperature dependence is only via the fermi factors of electrons .",
    "two important considerations in a calculation of current are the equilibrium location of the fermi level with respect to the band bottom of the device when connected to the contacts @xcite and the self - consistent potential profile of the device in the presence of an applied bias .",
    "we assume the case of reflectionless contacts @xcite and consider the scenario where the fermi energy can be varied with respect to the band bottom of the cnt .",
    "the ability to vary the fermi energy in a cnt has been demonstrated experimentally in refs . @xcite .",
    "the potential in the device is not calculated self - consistently and we simply assume a linear drop in the applied potential , while calculating the current versus voltage characteristics .",
    "in a conventional one dimensional chain , electrons traverse only a single effective path across the leads and as a result transmission is significantly altered by small amounts of disorder @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "electrons in a cnt can travel around defects because of the larger number of atoms in a cross section ( the number of modes is only two at the band center ) .",
    "an important issue is how disorder affects the conductance of cnt wires .",
    "we calculate transmission ( by this we mean the sum of the transmission coefficient over the incident modes , @xmath55 ) as a function of both the length of the disordered region and the magnitude of disorder using the procedure described in section [ sect : model ] .",
    "transmission versus energy and conductance versus gate voltage for one configuration of disorder is shown in fig .",
    "2 . transmission in a cnt has the following features that are in common with a single moded one dimensional chain : rapidly varying peaks that signify local resonances created by disorder and decrease in the average value with increasing disorder as the mismatch in the energies of the resonances increases with increase in disorder @xcite .",
    "we now discuss features that are typical of carbon nanotubes .",
    "2 shows a significant reduction in the transmission coefficient at energies close to the beginning of the second subband , even for weak disorder strengths .",
    "this leads to a dip in conductance when the fermi level is close to the beginning of the second subband ( fig .",
    "the origin of this dip is due to low velocity electrons in the second subband and can be understood as follows . in a perfect lattice , the velocity ( @xmath56 ) of electrons with the quantum number of the second subband and with an energy close to the beginning of the second subband is nearly zero .",
    "these low velocity electrons are easily reflected by the smallest of disorders .",
    "disorder causes mixing of the first and second subbands . as a result ,",
    "electrons incident in either subband at these energies develop a large reflection coefficient ( in comparison to energies close to the band center ) . increasing the disorder strength results in further reduction of the conductance and",
    "also results in the broadening of the dip .",
    "subsequent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) , we mentioned that the finite spatial extent of @xmath14 is neglected in our study . a model that includes",
    "the finite spatial extent of @xmath14 would require larger lengths of disordered regions to see dips whose magnitude is comparable to those in figs . 2 and 3 . the results in fig . 2 are for one random configuration of disorder distributed over a length of 1000 @xmath57 .",
    "we have carried out simulations over different length scales and disorder configurations and our results for the average transmission at the band center , averaged over more than a thousand disorder configurations are summarized in fig .",
    "the important point here is that for the smaller disorder strengths , the average transmission of a micron long ( 10,10 ) tube is not significantly affected by disorder , thus demonstrating the relative robustness of transport at the band center . for disordered regions larger than some localization length ( @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the conductance of quasi one dimensional samples has been predicted to decrease exponentially with length , @xmath59 , in the phase coherent limit @xcite . for lengths shorter than the localization length ,",
    "the decrease in conductance is not given by this equation .",
    "we observe this to be the case in our simulations ( inset of fig .",
    "4 ) . the value of @xmath58 corresponding to disorder strengths of 1ev and 1.75ev are 3353 @xmath57 and 1383 @xmath57 respectively .    we also compute transmission for nanotubes of different diameters .",
    "this study illustrates the effect of the number of atoms in a cross section of the wire .",
    "we compare transmission of the ( 10,10 ) tube with that of a ( 5,5 ) and ( 12,0 ) zig zag tubes .",
    "the diameters of these tubes are 13.4 @xmath57 , 9.4 @xmath57 and 6.7 @xmath57 respectively .",
    "for the ( 10,10 ) and ( 5,5 ) tubes , the band structure at energies close to the fermi energy are similar @xcite .",
    "but the number of atoms in a unit cell of a ( 5,5 ) tube is only half of that in a ( 10,10 ) tube ( they have 20 and 40 atoms respectively ) .",
    "5 shows the average transmission versus wire length .",
    "the important point here is that in spite of the identical transmission of a disorder free ( 10,10 ) and ( 5,5 ) tube at energies around the band center , transmission is smaller for the ( 5,5 ) tube in the presence of disorder .",
    "this is because the ( 5,5 ) tube has a smaller number of atoms around the circumference , thus reducing the number of paths by which electrons can travel around defects and across the device . to support this view point , we compare these results to conductance of a 1000 @xmath57 long ( 12,0 ) zig zag tube .",
    "we find that transmission is in between that of the ( 10,10 ) and ( 5,5 ) tubes ( fig .",
    "this is because the ( 12,0 ) tube has a diameter that is in between that of the ( 10,10 ) and ( 5,5 ) tube , and as a result the number of effective paths is larger than that available to a ( 5,5 ) tube but smaller than that of a ( 10,10 ) tube .",
    "can any of these effects be observed experimentally ?",
    "recently , arm chair , zig zag and tubes with chiralities in between have been experimentally characterized by stm imaging @xcite .",
    "transport measurements of single wall cnt at low temperatures has so far been limited by coulomb blockade due to large barriers at the contact - cnt interface @xcite .",
    "disorder of some degree is bound to exist in cnt samples and we believe that the variation in the linear response conductance with the gate potential@xcite and the dip in the conductance at energies close to the crossing of the first and second subbands can be observed in situations where the contact resistance is not the dominant factor .",
    "the length dependence of the conductance can also be studied by varying the length of the tube between the electrodes .",
    "one caveat is that phonon scattering will cause an increase in the low bias conductance in the presence of strong disorder with an increase in temperature .",
    "our calculations are relevant at low temperatures where phonon scattering is not significant .",
    "an electron can not hop on to such a defect site either due to a large mismatch in the on site potential or weak bonds with its neighbors ( section ii ) .",
    "scattering from a single defect causes a maximum reduction in the transmission at the band center e=0 .",
    "for example , the transmission of a ( 10,10 ) tube reduces from 2 to approximately 0.94 due to a single defect @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the effect of a few such defects scattered randomly along the length of the tube . reflection from more than a single defect causes the creation of quasi bound states along the tube , the exact locations of which are sensitive to the position of the defects .",
    "we find that a significant feature that is independent of the exact location of these defects is the opening of a _ transmission gap _ at the center of the band as defects are added .",
    "the second feature that we see in the simulations is that the width of the transmission gap increases with increase in the defect density .",
    "the transmission has sharp decreases at energies corresponding to the opening of the second subband , but this effect is relatively weak compared to the previous case of disorder . the simulation results illustrating these features are shown in fig . 6 for a wire of length 1000 @xmath57 with ten defects scattered along the length randomly . as a result of the transmission gap , the low bias conductance is greatly reduced from the defect free case , at zero gate voltage .",
    "conductance further depends significantly on temperature ( inset of fig .",
    "7a ) . in summary , while the conductance is not significantly affected by relatively weak uniform disorder ( figs . 3 and 4 ) , we find that the conductance here is much smaller than @xmath60 at zero gate voltage .",
    "conductance increases with gate voltage , with features of resonances due to the quasi bound states superimposed .",
    "these features get averaged out with increase in temperature .",
    "we also calculate current as a function of applied voltage by assuming a linear drop in the applied voltage .",
    "transmission at each applied voltage is computed and then we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) to calculate the current .",
    "the main feature in the i - v characteristic is the small increase in current with applied voltage close to the zero of applied voltage ( fig .",
    "the experimental work in ref . @xcite measured the i - v characteristics of a cnt rope .",
    "one of their main findings was that the differential conductance is very small at zero bias and that it increases with an increase in applied bias .",
    "the qualitative features of fig .",
    "8 are similar but an important difference is that the experiments were performed on a rope of single walled tubes , in which case it has recently been predicted that a band gap could open due to tube - tube interactions @xcite .",
    "we present a method to calculate the phase coherent transmission through nanotubes using a green s function formalism that can include the effect of semi infinite leads and can handle many defects and junctions with relative ease .",
    "we use this formalism to study the importance of scattering due to disorder .",
    "two simple models of disorder are considered and their effect on the conductance discussed . in the presence of weak uniform disorder , we find that the conductance is not significantly affected by disorder and that the wires behave as reasonably good quantum wires .",
    "for example a micron long ( 10,10 ) cnt with a disorder strength of 1ev ( section ii ) has a conductance comparable to @xmath61 .",
    "we predict that an experiment involving measurement of conductance versus gate voltage will show a dip in conductance when the fermi energy is close to the opening of the second subband ( fig .",
    "we compare the conductance of wires with varying diameters and find that the transmission ( conductance ) increases with the diameter of the tube for a given disorder strength ( fig . 5 ; note that in the absence of disorder the conductance is independent of the tube diameter at zero gate voltage ) .",
    "we attribute this to a decrease in the number of effective paths by which an electron can traverse across the device with decrease in the diameter .",
    "the second type of defect considered is strong isolated scatterers .",
    "in contrast to the previous type of disorder , this disorder creates a gap in the transmission at the band center and a corresponding large reduction in the low bias conductance . such disorder would destroy the good conductance properties of the wire at the band center .",
    "the work presented is based on numerical simulations . of interest",
    "could be further conductance experiments to look for features described in this paper .",
    "carbon nanotubes provide an unprecedented natural scenario for wires with a few modes and a relatively small cross sectional area .",
    "an analytical study of the effect of disorder in these systems and the dependence of the conductance as a function of diameter and chirality would be useful . also , of interest for future work would be a study that includes the effect of phonon scattering .",
    "we would like to thank jie han ( nasa ames research center ) for sharing his expertise on many aspects of carbon nanotubes and for lively discussions .",
    "we would like to thank manoj samanta and supriyo datta of purdue university for communicating the result of ( eq . [ eq : g ] ) before publication @xcite .",
