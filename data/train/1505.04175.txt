    "max dehn s decision problems have long been among the most fundamental problems in combinatorial and geometric group theory . especially with the development of geometric techniques ,",
    "we have seen a surge in progress in our understanding of the word and conjugacy problems over recent years .",
    "we develop a geometric approach to solving the conjugacy problem that runs in a similar vein to that of the conjugacy length function , but has the potential to provide a computationally faster algorithm than the nave algorithm associated to the conjugacy length function .",
    "it also has applications to computing the conjugacy growth rate and deciding the regularity of conjugacy languages .",
    "we let @xmath2 be group with finite generating set @xmath3 .",
    "we begin by defining the conjugacy length function for @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 are words on @xmath3 which represent conjugate elements of @xmath2 .",
    "an element @xmath5 of @xmath2 is a _ conjugator _ for @xmath4 if @xmath6 .",
    "define the _ conjugacy length function _ of @xmath2 to be the function @xmath7 which takes @xmath8 to the following value : @xmath9    the conjugacy length function is discussed in certain classes of groups in @xcite .",
    "see the introduction of these papers for further references .",
    "we remark that the conjugacy length function is stable when changing the generating set , up to the usual asymptotic equivalence of functions as set out in definition [ def : asymequiv ] below .",
    "we may therefore omit the generating set from the notation and just write @xmath10 for the conjugacy length function of @xmath2 .",
    "[ def : asymequiv]we consider functions up to the following equivalence : we say @xmath11 if there exists a constant @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for all @xmath14 , and we say @xmath15 if both @xmath11 and @xmath16 .",
    "we now move on to define a variation on @xmath10 , which we call the permutation conjugacy length function ( pcl ) of @xmath2 . a key difference between this and the conjugacy length function",
    "is that pcl is defined on words , whereas the conjugacy length function may be defined using elements .",
    "whenever we consider a word @xmath5 on @xmath3 , we will use the notation @xmath5 to denote both the word and the element in @xmath2 it represents . in case",
    "we need to emphasize that two words are equal , we use @xmath17 to denote letter - by - letter equality .    given a word @xmath18 on @xmath3 , a _",
    "cyclic permutation _ of @xmath0 is a word of the form @xmath19 , for any @xmath20 .",
    "suppose @xmath0 and @xmath1 are words on @xmath3 which represent conjugate elements of @xmath2 .",
    "an element @xmath5 is a _ permutation conjugacy conjugator _ , or more briefly a _ pc  conjugator _ , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 if there exist cyclic permutations @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively such that @xmath23 .",
    "[ def : pcl ] let @xmath4 be words on @xmath3 representing conjugate elements of @xmath2 .",
    "define @xmath24 to be the length of the shortest conjugator between all cyclic permutations of the words @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "that is : @xmath25 the _ permutation conjugacy length function _ of @xmath2 is the function @xmath26    we discuss below , in section [ sec : change gen set ] , its behaviour when changing generating set .    the permutation conjugacy length function is closely related to the standard conjugacy length function .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath27 the first inequality is clear from the definitions , while the latter is realised as follows : if @xmath4 have a pc  conjugator @xmath5 such that @xmath23 , then we obtain a conjugator @xmath28 for @xmath4 which acts first by cyclically permuting @xmath0 to @xmath21 , then conjugating by @xmath5 to get @xmath22 , then cyclically permuting to @xmath1 .",
    "a consequence of these inequalities is that if we know the conjugacy length function to be super - linear , then the same will also apply to the permutation conjugacy length function .",
    "therefore , studying the permutation conjugacy length function is only of interest when the group in question has ( sub)linear conjugacy length function .",
    "the simplest example of a group @xmath2 satisfying @xmath29 is a non - abelian free group .",
    "proposition [ propspecial : pcl hyp ] shows this can be extended to the family of hyperbolic groups .    in certain situations , studying the permutation conjugacy length function may give a better understanding of conjugacy in a group than one gets from the conjugacy length function .",
    "for example , it may lead to a faster algorithm solving the conjugacy problem than one may achieve by navely using @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , notions similar to the pcl are used in recent algorithms giving fast solutions in hyporbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups @xcite .",
    "these methods stemmed from a lemma of bridson and haefliger ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iii.@xmath30 lemma 2.11 ) which asserts that , for hyperbolic groups , pcl is bounded by a constant when restricting to words @xmath4 , all of whose cyclic permutations are local geodesics .",
    "we remove this restriction by studying pcl for all ( quasi-)geodesic words .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following .",
    "[ thmspecial : pcl ] let @xmath2 be a finitely generated group , hyperbolic relative to subgroups @xmath31 .",

    "we remark that the lower bound @xmath36 follows from the definitions and the fact that the parabolic subgroups @xmath37 are almost malnormal in @xmath2 and isometrically embedded .",
    "we note that @xmath10 is a constant function if and only if the group is finite - by - abelian ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the class of groups with constant @xmath38 is significantly bigger , including groups hyperbolic relative to finite - by - abelian subgroups , as theorem [ thmspecial : pcl ] shows .",
    "we remark that there is a virtually abelian group , proposed by holt , which we can show has linear @xmath38 .    an important family of groups that are relatively hyperbolic groups are limit groups , where the parabolic subgroups @xmath37 are abelian ( see @xcite ) . theorem [ thmspecial : pcl ] therefore gives a constant upper bound for the pcl of these groups .",
    "the complexity of the conjugacy problem in relatively hyperbolic groups has already been well - studied , including work of bumagin @xcite and oconner @xcite .",
    "the conjugacy length function , when it is polynomial in the subgroups @xmath37 , is investigated by ji , ogle and ramsey @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of theorem [ thmspecial : pcl ] , together with observation above , is a generalisation of the result of ji , ogle and ramsey @xcite concerning the conjugacy length function in relatively hyperbolic groups .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finitely generated group , hyperbolic relative to subgroups @xmath31 .",
    "then , either @xmath39 is sublinear or @xmath40    in the preceding result , we remark that @xmath10 may be sublinear only in certain cases when the relative hyperbolic structure is degenerate .",
    "the geometric techniques we use to determine a bound on the permutation conjugacy length function for relatively hyperbolic groups give the following :    [ propspecial : pcl hyp ] let @xmath2 be a hyperbolic group . then for every finite generating set @xmath3 there exists a constant @xmath41 such that @xmath42    we note also that proposition [ propspecial : pcl hyp ] is a generalisation of the aforementioned lemma of bridson and haefliger @xcite , extending the constant bound to all geodesic words .",
    "when restricting to cyclic geodesics , this property is also known as the `` bounded conjugacy diagram '' property ( bcd ) in @xcite , where it was studied for relatively hyperbolic groups .",
    "proposition [ propspecial : pcl hyp ] may of course be viewed as a corollary of theorem [ thmspecial : pcl ] , however this would be a rather convoluted way to prove it .",
    "indeed , in section [ sec : hyp cayley graphs ] below , we give a short proof of this fact , en route to proving the result for relatively hyperbolic groups .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : pcl ]",
    "we discuss some applications of the permutation conjugacy length function , namely complexity , conjugacy growth , and regular languages .",
    "we also investigate its behaviour under a change of generating set .    in section [ sec : hyp cayley graphs ] we set - up what may be viewed as a general strategy for dealing with pcl in groups with a hyperbolic cayley graph .",
    "section [ sec : rel hyp ] is devoted to defining relatively hyperbolic groups and collecting useful results from the literature .",
    "finally , section [ sec : proof ] gives the proof of theorem [ thmspecial : pcl ] .",
    "as mentioned before , @xmath38 is defined on words .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that throughout this paper , we assume that generating sets generate groups as monoids .",
    "in particular , we do nt require generating sets to be closed under inversion .    the authors wish to thank m. bestvina , l.  ciobanu , t.  riley , and r. wade for various discussions during the writing of this paper , and to the latter also for comments on a draft version of this paper .",
    "if @xmath10 is bounded above by a computable function and @xmath2 has solvable word problem , then one can solve the conjugacy problem in @xmath2 . indeed , given elements @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath43 , one just needs to check if an element in @xmath44 , the ball of radius @xmath39 , conjugates @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "note that , even in the case when @xmath39 is bounded by a linear function , this nave algorithm is far from being efficient and will run in exponential time , with respect to @xmath45 , for groups of exponential growth .",
    "a potentially important application of the permutation conjugacy length function is that it can make the previous algorithm more efficient .",
