    "many models of new physics beyond the standard model can lead to phenomena which produce similar signatures at future colliders .",
    "it will thus be necessary to have tools available with which to distinguish these models and to identify the specific new physics source . in this report",
    "we consider the set of diagnostic tools for model identification of spin-2 resonances and demonstrate that the excitation line shape can be a useful model discriminator .",
    "one class of possible of new physics scenarios is that of extra spatial dimensions at the tev scale which have been discussed in various contexts for some time@xcite . amongst this class of theories",
    "is the interesting and phenomenologically rich model of randall and sundrum(rs)@xcite which predicts the existence of graviton resonances that can be produced at high energy colliders@xcite .",
    "such resonances are easily distinguishable from other new states , such as a @xmath0@xcite , by measurements of the angular distribution of their decay products by which one can determine the spin of the initially decaying particle .",
    "the question we would like to address below is whether rs gravitons can be distinguished from other spin-2 states which can arise in extra dimensional scenarios .",
    "here we are interested in the particular case where only the lightest of the rs resonances is accessible to detailed accelerator study , , when the other more massive graviton excitations are beyond the collider center of mass energy .",
    "( having a visible series of resonance states would obviously make the situation easier .",
    "for example , a determination that the mass spectrum of a series of spin-2 resonances follows the pattern of the roots of the bessel function @xmath1 would strongly favor the rs interpretation . ) for some scenarios the model differentiation is quite straightforward , , in the case of regge - like , spin-2 excitations of the photon and @xmath2@xcite . here",
    "one finds that the branching fractions for these spin-2 states do not match those for gravitons so that these two models are easily separable given sufficient statistics and the visibility of the relevant final states at a given collider .",
    "in other cases , however , the situation may be more difficult , particularly so if the resonance appears more graviton - like . a good example of this is provided by the work of carena ( cdlpqw)@xcite that is based on the model by dvali and co - workers@xcite which predicts the existence of a single graviton - like resonance .",
    "in this class of models the propagator of the graviton obtains a rather complicated structure that arises due to novel brane interactions , including a dimensional - dependent , as well as energy - dependent , imaginary part and a real part which vanishes at a fixed value of @xmath3 .",
    "hence one produces an effective resonance which is is some sense a  collective \" mode .",
    "since this mode is constructed out of a superposition of the kk states in the graviton tower it has the same branching fractions as does an rs graviton and thus the two models can not be distinguished using such measurements .",
    "the dvali  model has three parameters : @xmath4 , the number of extra dimensions , @xmath5 , the effective resonance mass and @xmath6 , the @xmath7dimensional planck scale , which is on the order of a few tev .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath8 we recover the model of arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali(add)@xcite within this framework .",
    "for some values of the parameters the effective resonance shape looks very much like that of a relativistic breit - wigner(bw ) rs graviton ; this can easily be seen in fig .",
    "[ p3 - 25_fig1 ] .",
    "here is shown the cross section for @xmath9 in both the rs and dvali  models with a common value chosen for the resonance masses(500 gev ) and for various values of the other model parameters .",
    "we note that the @xmath10 excitation curve in the dvali  model is quite similar to that for the rs model with the only remaining free parameter @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , we note that for @xmath12 and @xmath13 fixed , increasing @xmath6 leads to a narrowing of the width and an increase in the peak height for this effective graviton which also makes the resonance appear more bw - like .",
    "this can be seen by examining the curves in fig .",
    "[ p3 - 25_fig2 ] . can the more conventional shape for the rs graviton be distinguished from that of the non - bw  effective \" resonance distribution in the dvali  model at a linear collider ?     in the dvali ( left ) and rs(right ) models . for the dvali  case",
    "we assume @xmath14 tev with @xmath15(red dots ) and @xmath16 and 6(solid red , green , blue and magenta curves ) .",
    "the cyan curve is the add model prediction with constructive interference . for the rs model the sample curves are for the parameter @xmath17 in the range 0.01 - 0.1.,title=\"fig:\",width=204 ]   in the dvali ( left ) and rs(right ) models . for the dvali  case",
    "we assume @xmath14 tev with @xmath15(red dots ) and @xmath16 and 6(solid red , green , blue and magenta curves ) .",
    "the cyan curve is the add model prediction with constructive interference . for the rs model the sample curves are for the parameter @xmath17 in the range 0.01 - 0.1.,title=\"fig:\",width=196 ]     assuming @xmath10 , @xmath18 gev and @xmath19 tev in steps of 1 tev corresponding to the red , green , blue , magenta and cyan curves , respectively.,width=264 ]    to this end we undertook a preliminary study of the two line shapes which we imagine taking place after an unfolding of the initial state radiation and beamstahlung spectra ; in particular we try to fit the non - bw dvali   effective \" resonance under the assumption that it is instead a bw rs graviton and perform a fit for the rs model parameter @xmath17 .",
    "a poor quality fit would thus indicate that the two scenarios are distinguishable . in this sample study",
    "we imagine the production of a graviton - like resonance ( , spin-2 and with the proper branching fractions ) with a mass of 1 tev .",
    "we next generate the excitation curves for a set of different resonances in @xmath9 assuming an integrated luminosity of 500 @xmath20 .",
    "since the dvali  resonance shape is non - bw we do not follow the usual approach for fitting a bw but instead we fit a larger @xmath21 region surrounding the resonance peak . given the rather similar shapes of the two resonances we fit the cross section over the region @xmath22 tev in steps of 40 gev . since this is merely a first pass analysis",
    "we make no attempt to optimize the luminosity and assume that the 500 @xmath20 is shared equally amongst the generated data points ; an overall @xmath23 luminosity uncertainty is included in this analysis . to test this approach we first try to fit two true rs model resonances with the input values @xmath24 .",
    "this comparison is done by employing a series of ` templates ' which are obtained by generating the relevant cross section data for the rs model for values of @xmath17 in the range 0.010 - 0.210 in 200 steps of 0.001 .",
    "we then perform our fits by using a large order polynomial to interpolate the values of the cross sections at other intermediate values of @xmath25 for each of the relevant values of @xmath21 .",
    "the fine granularity in the templates insures that the polynomial interpolation gives an extremely accurate estimate for the value of the true cross section .",
    "these rs model fits yield @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , with very good @xmath28 s as shown in fig .",
    "[ p3 - 25_fig3 ] .",
    "next , we attempt to fit the dvali  model ; for low values of @xmath6 the fits are very poor but improve as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "[ p3 - 25_fig3 ] shows the results of these fits when @xmath29 tev . for cases where the value of @xmath6 are below 5 tev , the resulting @xmath28 s are very large and are not shown . note that the value of both the minimum @xmath28 and the fitted value for @xmath25 decrease as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "clearly from this figure we see that for values of @xmath6 below @xmath30 tev the fit is sufficiently poor to claim that the rs hypothesis fails and the rs and dvali  models are easily distinguished . in particular , for @xmath31 tev we obtain a minimum @xmath32 of 52.9/13(27.4/13 ) which corresponds to a confidence level of @xmath33",
    ". however , as we raise @xmath6 much beyond @xmath30 tev we obtain an acceptable @xmath28 and the two models are no longer distinguishable .",
    "we would expect to do somewhat better in this separation with an optimised distribution of luminosity ; this is currently under investigation .     assuming the validity of the rs model .",
    "the resonance mass is taken to be 1 tev and a total integrated luminosity of 500@xmath20 is assumed as described in the text .",
    "the red(green ) curves are for rs gravitons with @xmath24 are used as tests of our fitting method .",
    "the blue(magenta , cyan ) curves are the corresponding fits for the dvali  model with @xmath34 tev.,width=264 ]",
    "the above simplified analysis has shown that in some case the line shapes of spin-2 resonances can be a useful tool for model identification of spin-2 resonances at linear colliders .",
    "in particular , we have shown in a toy analysis that the line shape can be used to distinguish the graviton resonances of the rs model from the  collective \" resonance present in the dvali  model over a reasonable range of model parameters even without an optimization of the luminosity distribution in the resonance region . a detector simulation along the lines of the present analysis including such an optimization would prove useful .    # 1 # 2 # 3 mod .",
