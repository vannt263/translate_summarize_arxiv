    "low energy effective models are a valuable tool for the study of the low - energy thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter .",
    "their importance is even greater in the case for finite chemical potential where the sign problem afflicts the more fundamental approach of using lqcd .",
    "two of the main features of the non - perturbative regime of qcd are the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and confinement . for both",
    "a transition is expected to occur at finite temperature and/or chemical potential : partial restoration of chiral symmetry and deconfinement ( with the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0 centre symmetry ) .",
    "the njl model @xcite incorporates by construction a mechanism for the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and shares with qcd its global symmetries .",
    "the unwanted axial symmetry can be removed by the inclusion of a t hooft determinantal @xcite term but this however introduces a vacuum stability problem when considering the light quark sector ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks ) .",
    "this issue can be solved by further extending the model to include eight - quark interaction terms @xcite .",
    "a partial inclusion of the gluonic degrees of freedom can be done through the consideration of a static background homogeneous temporal gauge gluonic field coupled to the quark fields through the covariant derivative @xcite .",
    "the polyakov loop can then be used as an approximate order parameter for deconfinement ( it vanishes for the confined phase ) .",
    "an additional temperature - dependent pure `` gluonic '' term , the polyakov potential , @xmath4 , for which several forms have been proposed , must also be introduced to drive the transition . due to space constraints here",
    "we will only present results referring to the polynomial form as proposed in @xcite ( furthermore the results are qualitatively similar with the other forms tested ) .    the specification of an non - renormalizable effective model is not complete without the choice of a regularization procedure . in the present study we will use a pauli - villars regulator with two subtractions in the integrand @xcite . in @xcite we have shown that using this we can obtain the expected high - temperature asymptotic behaviour for the pnjl model while consistently using the same regularization procedure for both the vacuum and medium contributions for the relevant integrals .",
    "the thermodynamic potential is given by ( for more details see @xcite ) : @xmath5 here @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 refer to the coupling strengths of the 4q ( njl term ) , 6q ( t hooft determinant ) and ozi - violating and non - violating 8q interactions respectively . @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) refer to the dynamical masses and the condensates which must satisfy the conditions ( @xmath13 refers to current masses ) : @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( a mass independent , but @xmath17 dependent , term which must be added to ensure thermodynamic consistency @xcite ) are given by : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the energy and @xmath20/@xmath21 refer to the occupation numbers ( the subscript @xmath22 refers to the occupation number for massless particles ) .",
    "the extension to include the polyakov loop in the @xmath15 integrals can be done straightforwardly by noticing that its phase enters the action as an imaginary chemical potential and modifying the occupation numbers accordingly .",
    "the regulator was chosen to be @xmath23 .",
    "several quantities are expected to undergo a rapid change during the transitions acting therefore as a signal for the determination of the pseudo critical temperatures ( note that with physical quark current masses both the chiral and the @xmath0 centre symmetries are only approximate ; they are only exact in the chiral and quenched limit respectively ) . besides a rapid change in the condensates and polyakov loop one also expects a distinct signal coming from the chiral , quark number and polyakov loop susceptibilities : @xmath24",
    "the use of the dual chiral condensates has been suggested as a possible additional indicator for deconfinement @xcite .",
    "these correspond to the fourier transform with respect to an angle which is introduced through the consideration of twisted temporal boundary conditions : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 , ( with @xmath29 ) .",
    "results for the temperature dependence of the dressed polyakov loop ( which corresponds to setting @xmath30 in the above ) will also be presented here .",
    "as we reported in @xcite it is possible to obtain the same low energy scalar and pseudoscalar mesonic spectra throughout a large range of values for the ozi - violating 8q coupling strength by simultaneously lowering g when increasing @xmath8 ( except for the @xmath31 meson mass which decreases for higher @xmath8 ) . here",
    "we will focus therefore in the impact of this choice in the transitions behaviour .",
    "another parameter , @xmath32 , coming from the polynomial form of @xmath4 has also to be taken into account ( it sets the temperature scale for the temperature dependence of @xmath4 ) .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 the chiral condensates , the polyakov loop and the dual chiral condensates undergo a rapid change in a narrow temperature range signaling the transitions .",
    "the change is more rapid and occurs at a lower temperature for stronger 8q interactions .",
    "the behavior of the dressed polyakov loop closely follows that of the chiral condensate and the zeros of the second derivative with respect to the temperature are in fact very close to each other ( a few @xmath33 apart at most ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the susceptibilities is also strongly influenced by the value of @xmath8 as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 : the peaks get sharper and higher with increasing @xmath8    .    a comparison with lqcd results ( see fig .",
    "3 a ) and b ) ) for several quantities such as the interaction measure and the subtracted chiral condensate gives a reasonable result .",
    "the deviation from the lqcd result in what refers to the subtracted chiral condensate is probably related to the slow chiral restoration of the strange quark ( fig .",
    "the position of the critical endpoint of qcd in the phase diagram is also very affected by the value of @xmath8 as can be seen in fig .",
    "the @xmath32 parameter from @xmath4 on the other hand only seems to affect the temperature at which it occurs and not the chemical potential .",
