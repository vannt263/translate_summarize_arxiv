    "in the last years we have witnessed a spectacular acceleration in the experimental manipulation of neutral atoms in optical lattices @xcite that has opened the way to the simulation of quantum complex systems of condensed matter physics , such as high-@xmath0 superconductors , hall systems , and superfluid @xmath1 , thanks to the extreme flexibility and controllability of such atom - optical systems @xcite .",
    "optical lattices are stable periodic arrays of microscopic potentials created by the interference patterns of intersecting laser beams @xcite .",
    "atoms can then be confined in different lattice sites , and by varying the strength of the periodic potential it is possible to tune the interatomic interactions with great precision and to enhance them well into the regime of strong correlations , even in the dilute limit .",
    "the transition to a strong coupling regime can be realized by increasing the depth of the lattice potential wells , a quantity that is directly proportional to the intensity of the laser light which , in turn , is an experimental parameter that can be controlled with great accuracy .",
    "for this reason , besides the fundamental interest for the investigation of quantum phase transitions @xcite and other collective quantum phenomena @xcite , optical lattices have become an important tool in applications ranging from laser cooling @xcite to quantum control and information processing @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the theory of neutral bosonic atoms in optical lattices has been originally developed , in its simplest framework , by assuming that the atoms are confined to the lowest bloch band of the periodic optical potential @xcite .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that in this approximation the system is very well described by the standard , on site bose hubbard model . in such a model",
    "a superfluid - mott insulator ( sf - mi ) transition is predicted to occur when the energy gap between the local ground state and the first excited levels becomes comparable to the hopping energy between adjacent lattice sites @xcite .",
    "moreover , no major qualitative changes appear when higher excited energy levels of the external trapping potentials are considered @xcite .",
    "this prototypical quantum phase transition can be realized experimentally , for instance by manipulating the strength of the lattice potential , which results in a controlled change of the kinetic ( hopping ) energy term @xcite .",
    "following this kind of approach , the superfluid - mott insulator quantum phase transition has been realized in a series of beautiful experiments , by loading an ultracold atomic bose - einstein condensate in a three - dimensional optical lattice @xcite . at finite temperature and in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "the quantum phase transition is smeared in a classical transition from a completely disordered regime to an ordered , superfluid phase ( sf ) @xcite . finally ,",
    "if more complicated geometrical settings such as optical superlattices , networks , and graphs , are considered , interesting unconventional interplays between the different quantum phases may appear @xcite .    in the on site bose hubbard ( bh ) model all the terms deriving from two - body interactions between the bosonic atoms",
    "are neglected except the local ones taking place on a same site of the optical lattice .",
    "this is often an excellent approximation .",
    "however , microscopic interactions are in general of finite range , and it may be interesting to address the problem of the physical picture that emerges if one takes into account two - body interactions between sites at non - vanishing distance and/or hopping amplitudes beyond nearest - neighbor sites . this problem has been extensively studied in the case of charged fermions , which are endowed with very long range coulomb interactions , usually by introducing extended fermi hubbard models with nearest - neighbor interaction terms @xcite . extended fermi hubbard models are prototypical in theoretical condensed matter physics , because they are believed to be more realistic approximations to the true inter - electronic interactions and moreover exhibit richer phase diagrams when compared to the standard hubbard model , especially in low spatial dimensions @xcite",
    "in the present paper , we extend this kind of analysis to the bosonic case , and we introduce and study a type of extended bose hubbard model for the description of interacting bosons in regular lattices .",
    "our study , although general , will be mainly concerned with the analysis of realistic physical systems such as dilute ensembles of interacting spin - zero bosonic neutral atoms subject to an optical lattice potential and spatially confined by a slowly varying harmonic trapping . confining our attention to the lowest band of the optical lattice potential , we construct an effective extended bose hubbard hamiltonian , that emerges when we take into account the terms deriving from the boson - boson interactions both on the same lattice site and on pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "our aim is then to analyze the phase transitions that may occur in such systems both at zero and at finite temperature , and determine the general features of the associated phase diagrams .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we set the general notations , the needed tools , and derive the model hamiltonian from the underlying microscopic dynamics in second quantization .",
    "we identify an exponential lattice scale factor , the _ lattice attenuation factor _ that gives rise to a natural expansion parameter for the hamiltonian of the system . in this way we are able to determine all the dominant terms that need to be retained in a power series expansion of the different energy contributions , that add to the terms of the standard bose hubbard ( bh ) model hamiltonian .",
    "these additional terms can be easily identified and ordered in increasing powers of the lattice attenuation factor and include nearest - neighbor interactions , nearest - neighbor hoppings of single atoms conditioned by the on site occupation number , and nearest - neighbor hoppings of atomic pairs ( bosonic pairs ) .",
    "the ensuing hamiltonian defines a type of extended bose hubbard ( ebh ) model of interacting bosons in the lowest bloch band .",
    "other types of ebh models can be obtained by considering interactions with far neighbors , and can be related to the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "other different types of hubbard - like models can also be obtained , at least for one - dimensional fermionic systems , by implementing appropriate mode expansions of the second - quantized fermionic field operators , as recently shown by massel and penna @xcite .",
    "the quantum phase diagrams of different types of ebh models have been extensively investigated by means of quantum monte carlo techniques . in these studies",
    "the possible existence of density wave and supersolid phases in @xmath2 and in @xmath3 spatial dimensions has been carefully discussed @xcite . in the present work we set up a formalism that allows to study in detail the explicit dependence of ebh models on the physical parameters of realistic systems of ultracold neutral atoms in optical lattice potentials and external confining harmonic potentials . equipped with these tools",
    ", we can then establish the range of values of the hamiltonian parameters that should be reached experimentally for the possible observation of the new quantum phases predicted by ebh models , such as the density wave mott insulating regime .",
    "our treatment does not involve issues of metastability and lifetime for states defined on excited energy bands ; it allows the study of the phase diagram both at zero and at finite temperature ; and , finally , is based on a systematic expansion that connects any ebh model to the underlying microscopic many - body dynamics in second quantization .",
    "moreover , it can be in principle extended to more general situations , including multi - species bosonic systems and fermi - bose mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms .",
    "other generalizations of the on site hubbard model are of course possible by including bloch bands of higher order in the description .",
    "two such possible ebh models with inter - band hoppings and interactions have been recently investigated in connection with proposed schemes to generate metastable excited states of cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .    in sec.iii",
    ", we analyze the phase diagram of the extended bose hubbard model ( ebh ) in the standard grand canonical formalism .",
    "we first consider the structure of the quantum phases at zero temperature , when all the kinetic terms vanish ( strong coupling regime ) .",
    "remarkably , in this case the model is mapped into a quantum antiferromagnetic ising model in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "as it is well known , this model undergoes a quantum transition between a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic phase @xcite . as a consequence , in a small range of parameters ( very strong coupling regime ) for a system of bosons in an optical lattice",
    ", there exists a new insulator phase in which the atomic density is not constant on each lattice site .",
    "this new quantum phase can be seen as a density wave mott insulator ( dwmi ) , and is of course absent in the on site bh model that can sustain only a pure mott insulator ( pmi ) phase at constant density . in the dwmi phase",
    ", there appear two alternating domains ( sublattices ) of different mean on site occupation numbers , that are the atomic counterparts of the domains of different staggered magnetization in the antiferromagnetic phase of the quantum ising model .",
    "next , we reintroduce the kinetic terms in the ebh hamiltonian by resorting to bogoliubov - like and mean field approximations . in this framework three",
    "real - valued order parameters emerge : the conventional single boson ( single atom ) superfluid order parameter , a new bosonic pair superfluid order parameter , and finally the mean number of bosons ( atoms ) per site .",
    "this parameters are not all independent from each other , due to the existence of physical constraints on thermodynamic stability and on the pmi - dwmi phase separation .    in sec.iv , we present qualitative and analytical studies of the different possible phases in the presence of non vanishing kinetic energy terms . in this case ,",
    "minimization of the free energy with respect to the different order parameters yields that the only superfluid transition which can occur is the one ruled by the single atom sf order parameter .",
    "we analyze the behavior or the sf - pmi and the sf - dwmi quantum phase transitions at zero temperature , and the behavior of the sf single boson order parameter at finite temperature .",
    "we study the critical temperature of the disordered - sf phase transition as a function of the filling factor and of the lattice depth .",
    "then , starting from finite temperatures , we analyze the possibility to recover the sf - pmi and the sf - dwmi quantum phase transitions by determining the behavior of the critical energy gap in the limit of vanishing temperature , as a function of the lattice depth and for different values of the trapping frequencies . by comparing the phase diagrams obtained for different values of the hamiltonian parameters ,",
    "we discuss the possibility of observing experimentally the zero - temperature transition to the sf - dwmi phase in systems of neutral atoms loaded in optical lattice potentials .",
    "finally , in sec.v we give some concluding comments on the obtained results and discuss some possible directions for future research .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian for an ensemble of bosonic atoms that are confined by a slowly varying external harmonic trapping potential and subject to an additional optical lattice can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the kinetic energy term that reads @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the bosonic annihilation field operator at point @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand @xmath9 represents the contribution of the external potential to the energy : @xmath10 in concrete situations , spatial confinement of the atoms is provided by the quadrupolar anisotropic trapping magnetic field that leads to an harmonic trapping potential of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the frequency associated to the harmonic trap in the @xmath13 direction and @xmath14 is the anisotropic coefficient , i.e. the ratio between the frequency in the @xmath15 plane and the frequency in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the most common experimental settings are realized in the so - called configuration @xmath16 .",
    "correspondingly , the second contribution to the potential energy is a periodic potential needed to realize the optical lattice along the axis of the `` cigar '' : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the maximum amplitude of the light shift associated to the intensity of the laser beam and @xmath19 is the lattice spacing related to the wave vector @xmath20 of the standing laser light by @xmath21 .",
    "finally , the third contribution is the local , contact two - body interaction @xmath22 in which the interaction coupling @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the atomic mass and @xmath25 is the atom - atom ( boson - boson ) @xmath26-wave scattering length . in the following",
    ", we will always assume boson - boson repulsion , i.e. @xmath27 .    in the presence of a strong optical lattice and a sufficiently shallow external confinement in the @xmath13 direction",
    ", so that at any lattice site its value can be considered constant , the bosonic field operators can be expanded in the basis of the single - particle wannier wave - functions localized at each lattice site @xmath28 .",
    "since the typical interaction energies involved are normally not strong enough in order to excite higher vibrational states , we can retain only the the lowest vibrational state in each lattice potential well ( single - band approximation ) . in the case of stronger external confinements , or interactions",
    ", one should include higher bloch bands as well in the expansion of field operators , a case we do not consider in the present context .",
    "moreover , as far as the harmonic trapping potential is concerned , we have shown in a previous work @xcite that the introduction of higher energy levels of the harmonic oscillator does not modify the basic phenomenology of the system . under these conditions , we can avoid working directly with the exact wannier wave functions and replace them , with an excellent degree of fidelity , with their harmonic - oscillator approximations at each optical lattice well .",
    "then , the wannier wave functions @xmath29 factorize in the product of harmonic oscillator states in each direction : @xmath30 where @xmath28 is the center of the @xmath31-th lattice well and @xmath32 is the bosonic annihilation operator acting at the lattice site . in each lattice potential",
    "well , the wannier local ground states are gaussians in the harmonic approximation : @xmath33 \\nonumber \\ ; , \\\\   w(y)&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{l_{\\perp } \\sqrt{\\pi } } }   \\exp\\left[\\frac{-y^{2}}{2l^{2}_{\\perp}}\\right ] \\ ; , \\\\",
    "w(z)&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{l_{\\perp } \\sqrt{\\pi } } }   \\exp\\left[\\frac{-z^{2}}{2l^{2}_{\\perp}}\\right ] \\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ harmonic oscillator eigenstate ] ) we have introduced the harmonic oscillator lengths of the ground state in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions @xmath36 , and the oscillator length in the harmonic approximations of the periodic potential @xmath37 that reads , as a function of the lattice parameters , , where @xmath38 is the lattice recoil energy . in this paper we will consider the physical situation of very shallow trapping potentials , such that @xmath39 , with @xmath40 denoting the total number of lattice sites . as a consequence , the local density approximation ( lda ) can be applied .",
    "therefore , when exploiting the expansion eq .",
    "( [ wannierexpansion ] ) to map the full microscopic hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ fullhamiltonian ] ) into its lattice version , we will discard all terms that are of order @xmath41 or higher .",
    "qualitatively , this means neglecting those nonlocal effects that are induced by the presence of the trapping potentials , such as site - dependent hopping terms . the latter can become important in regions of the lattice very far out of the central core of the harmonic trap .",
    "however , the typical experimental situations involve only that part of the lattice that lies well inside the central core of the slowly varying confining potential @xcite .",
    "we can then write down the translationally invariant lattice version of hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ fullhamiltonian ] ) in the form @xmath42 in eq .",

    "( [ wannierexpansion ] ) and of the lattice wave functions eq .",

    "it is worth noticing that @xmath49 can be re - expressed in the form @xmath50 , i.e. in terms of an experimentally measurable and tunable quantity , the depth @xmath26 of the lattice wells : @xmath51 .    on the other hand , in eq .",
    "( [ latticeh1 ] ) , @xmath52 is the strength of the contributions of the kinetic and the external potential terms to the energy .",
    "for @xmath53 it gives rise to a constant zero point energy term that can be discarded by redefining the zero of the energy ; if @xmath54 it represents the probability amplitude for an atom to tunnel from the lattice site to the along the @xmath13 direction . obviously , also this probability amplitude is a function of the distance between the involved sites , but it is impossible to write for it a closed analytical formula like eq .",
    "( [ u function d ] ) .",
    "however , from the form of eq .",
    "( [ harmonic oscillator eigenstate ] ) it is easy to show that @xmath55 is still proportional to some positive power of the lattice attenuation factor @xmath49 , with the exponent depending only on the distance between the sites .",
    "hence , in general one can write @xmath56 where @xmath57 decreases as a polynomial function of the modulus of the distance between the sites . taking into account the form of the kinetic energy eq .",

    "( [ j function d ] ) remarks the fact that the one - body contributions to the energy are function of the lattice attenuation factor @xmath49 as well . in typical experimental situations , the lattice spacing @xmath19 is usually much larger than the local ground state length @xmath37 at each lattice site .",
    "hence @xmath60 , and this fact allows to exploit the lattice attenuation factor as a meaningful dimensionless expansion parameter .",
    "the first two nontrivial contributions to the one - body part of the energy are proportional to @xmath49 , corresponding to @xmath58 and @xmath61 , corresponding to @xmath62 .",

    "when dealing with systems of interacting bosons , it is convenient to work in the framework of the grand canonical ensemble @xcite .",

    "we first briefly recall how to determine the energy spectrum of the local part of the hamiltonian in the standard bh model , i.e. when we neglect the term proportional to @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ localgrancanonicalterm ] ) . in this case",
    ", it is well known that each term in the sum of on site interaction energies reaches its minimum for with @xmath83 this trivial observation naturally leads to introduce the complete orthonormal fock basis @xmath84 and determines an obvious but important classification .",
    "if @xmath85 is close to an integer value , say @xmath86 , we have that the energy gap @xmath87 between the ground state @xmath88 and the first excited state is of the order of the coupling constant @xmath89 .",
    "this , incidentally , justifies neglecting , in first approximation , any correction proportional to any power @xmath90 of @xmath49 .",
    "in this situation , at zero temperature , the system is in a mott - insulator phase with exactly @xmath86 atoms per site .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath85 is closer to a half - integer value , then the energy gap @xmath87 can be comparable with other contributions to the interaction energy , and one can write @xmath91 where @xmath86 is integer , @xmath92 and the two number states nearly degenerate in energy are @xmath88 and @xmath93 .",

    "<S> , we determine the free energy of the system and study the phase diagram both at zero and at finite temperature . at variance with the standard on site bose hubbard model , the zero temperature phase diagram of the ebh model possesses a dual structure in the mott insulating regime . </S>",
    "<S> namely , for specific ranges of the lattice parameters , a density wave phase characterizes the system at integer fillings , with domains of alternating mean occupation numbers that are the atomic counterparts of the domains of staggered magnetizations in an antiferromagnetic phase . </S>",
