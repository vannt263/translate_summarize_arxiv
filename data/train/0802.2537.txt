    "the notion of `` element of reality '' was introduced in the famous einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) paper  @xcite , as an attribute of a physical quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty without disturbing the system . criticizing the epr conclusion that quantum mechanics is incomplete , bohr  @xcite argued that the phrase `` without in any way disturbing a system '' is ambiguous and emphasized the necessity of taking into account the experimental arrangement with which a physical quantity is measured . to avoid the ambiguity , redhead  @xcite gave the following sufficient condition for the existence of an element of reality , hereafter called er1 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if we can predict with certainty , or at any rate with probability one , the result of measuring a physical quantity at time @xmath1 , then at the time @xmath1 there exists an element of reality corresponding to the physical quantity and having a value equal to the predicted measurement result .",

    "these were originally developed as nonrelativistic theories , and it has been notoriously difficult to reconcile them with the special theory of relativity . eventually , the question was raised whether lorentz - invariant elements of reality are inconsistent with quantum mechanics  @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to revisit that question , and bring a number of additional considerations to it .",
    "i will first analyze in detail hardy s argument , which was meant to show that lorentz - invariant elements of reality are indeed inconsistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "i will argue that this and related arguments use er1 not only as a sufficient condition for the existence of an element of reality , but also , it seems , as a necessary condition .",
    "a contradiction then immediately follows , quite independently from details of quantum mechanics .",
    "my argument will make use of constraints , derived in the appendix , on elements of reality associated with a maximal set of commuting hermitian operators .",
    "i will then investigate to what extent the light cone associated with an event can be used to define lorentz - invariant elements of reality .",
    "it turns out to be possible , but these elements of reality wo nt satisfy the so - called product rule , i.e. an element of reality associated with a product of two commuting operators will not always be equal to the product of elements of reality associated with each operator  @xcite .",
    "building on this i will discuss a number of analyses of hardy s and related arguments published in the literature .",
    "hardy s gedanken experiment  @xcite is illustrated in fig .",
    "two mach - zehnder - type interferometers are set up , one for electrons ( mz@xmath2 , lower right ) and one for positrons ( mz@xmath3 , upper left ) .",
    "electrons ( positrons ) are emitted with initial wave function @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "two beam splitters bs1@xmath6 act in such a way that @xmath7 the overlap of the two interferometers allows paths @xmath8 and @xmath9 to meet at point @xmath10 . in that case",
    "the electron and positron annihilate , i.e. @xmath11    let the initial state of the system be @xmath12 . using ( [ bs1 ] ) and  ( [ gamma ] )",
    ", we find that beyond beam splitters bs1@xmath6 and beyond point @xmath10 , the state of the system has been transformed into @xmath13 in each interferometer , the two paths are reflected by mirrors arranged so that the paths eventually meet again .",
    "at the meeting points are two additional beam splitters bs2@xmath2 and bs2@xmath3 that act on the incoming beams so that and bs2@xmath3 are removable , but we do nt need this flexibility here . ]",
    "@xmath14 let @xmath15 be the rest frame of the two interferometers .",
    "we assume that in @xmath15 , the electron and positron in each run of the experiment reach bs2@xmath2 and bs2@xmath3 simultaneously . just before this",
    "then , the state of the system is given by  ( [ pointp ] ) .",
    "we now consider two additional lorentz frames @xmath16 and @xmath17 , moving with respect to @xmath15 with opposite velocities .",
    "these velocities are chosen so that in @xmath16 , the electron arrives at bs2@xmath2 much before the positron arrives at bs2@xmath3 , whereas in @xmath17 , the positron arrives much before the electron .",
    "consider a time in @xmath16 when the electron has gone through bs2@xmath2 , but the positron has not yet reached bs2@xmath3 . using ( [ pointp ] ) and  ( [ bs2 ] ) , we find that the state of the system is then given by @xmath18 similarly , at a time in @xmath17 when the positron has gone through bs2@xmath3 but the electron has not yet reached bs2@xmath2 , the state of the system is given by @xmath19 finally , we note that when both the electron and positron have gone through the second beam splitters , the state of the system is given by @xmath20    to argue against relativistic elements of reality , hardy proposes a sufficient condition for their existence and a necessary condition for their lorentz invariance .",
    "the sufficient condition for the existence of an element of reality essentially coincides with redhead s er1 . the necessary condition for lorentz invariance of elements of reality , hereafter called li1 , simply reads as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the value of an element of reality corresponding to a lorentz - invariant observable is itself lorentz invariant .",

    "hardy introduces two observables @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 he then points out that    1 .   in state @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; 2 .   in state",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 ; 3 .   in state @xmath29 , @xmath30 ;",
    "4 .   in any state",
    "@xmath31 orthogonal to @xmath29 , @xmath32 .    from er1",
    "he concludes that @xmath33 we can now state hardy s argument against lorentz - invariant elements of reality .",
    "consider a situation where , in frame @xmath17 , a positron is detected in @xmath34 before the electron reaches bs2@xmath2 .",
    "then the system s state ( [ fplus ] ) is projected onto its last term , and the electron s state becomes @xmath27 . in this case @xmath28 in @xmath17 and , by li1 and since @xmath35 is lorentz invariant , @xmath28 in all lorentz frames .",
    "similarly , consider a situation where , in frame @xmath16 , an electron is detected in @xmath36 before the positron reaches bs2@xmath3 .",
    "then the system s state ( [ fminus ] ) is projected onto its last term , the positron s state becomes @xmath25 and @xmath26 in all lorentz frames . according to ( [ after ] ) , both these situations will occur together , on average , in one of every sixteen runs .",
    "whenever they occur together , in all frames before detection we have @xmath28 and @xmath26 , whence by ( [ fuu ] ) , @xmath30 . but according to ( [ pointp ] ) the state in @xmath15 , the rest frame of the two interferometers , is orthogonal to @xmath29 .",
    "hence @xmath32 , which establishes the contradiction and shows that lorentz - invariant elements of reality are incompatible with quantum mechanics .",
    "in formulating his argument , hardy made explicit use of the projection postulate .",
    "one can see , however , that this amounts to little more than a verbal simplification , and that the use of the postulate is in no way necessary to reach the intended conclusion .",
    "indeed consider the steps leading to the conclusion that @xmath28 in @xmath17 . from ( [ fplus ] ) , one easily sees that the probability of obtaining the result  1 upon measuring @xmath35 , conditional on obtaining the result  1 upon measuring @xmath34 , is given by @xmath37 this means that if we obtain  1 upon measuring @xmath34 , we can predict with certainty that we will obtain  1 upon measuring @xmath35 .",
    "by er1 then , and without any appeal to the projection postulate , @xmath28 .",
    "let us now focus on condition er1 .",
    "just like redhead , hardy intends it as a sufficient condition for the existence of an element of reality .",
    "i will now argue that it is actually used in a much stronger way . to see this ,",
    "consider the following steps of a possible proof of  ( [ fuu ] ) :    1 .",
    "assume that @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath39 is either 1 or  0 , we must have both @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   since there is an element of reality corresponding to @xmath40 having value  1 , we can predict with certainty that measuring @xmath40 will yield value  1 .",
    "therefore the system s state @xmath41 is an eigenstate of @xmath40 with eigenvalue  1 .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 is an eigenstate of @xmath35 with eigenvalue  1 .",
    "3 .   since @xmath41 is an eigenstate of @xmath40 and @xmath35 with eigenvalue  1 in each case , it is also an eigenstate of @xmath42 with eigenvalue  1 .",
    "since @xmath41 is an eigenstate of @xmath42 with eigenvalue  1 , we can predict with certainty that measuring @xmath42 will yield value  1 . hence",
    "@xmath30 .",
    "looking closely at step  2 , one can see that it assumes that er1 is not only a sufficient , but also a necessary condition .",
    "admittedly , steps  14 represent one possible reconstruction of the proof of  ( [ fuu ] ) , and we can not rule out other reconstructions that would use weaker conditions . but no proof of  ( [ fuu ] ) is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming er1 as a sufficient condition only .    that er1 is in fact used as a necessary condition gains additional support from the assumption that the elements of reality obey the so - called product rule , i.e. @xmath43 i show in the appendix that any real - valued function @xmath44 which ( i ) is defined on a maximal set of commuting hermitian operators , ( ii ) satisfies",
    "the product rule , and ( iii ) is 1 on some but not all unit projectors in the set , singles out a one - dimensional subspace of the state space , i.e.  there is only one projector in the set on which @xmath45 . if the element of reality that this function assigns is identified with an eigenvalue of a quantum observable , then a unique state vector is singled out by the specification that @xmath45 .",
    "hence it leads to the most definite predictions that quantum mechanics allows .",
    "one should note that the same analysis applies to the proofs given in ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "an inference similar to  ( [ fuu ] ) is used at the bottom of the second column of p.  181 . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors consider separately the cases where qm is or is not complete . in the former ( p.  124 )",
    ", elements of reality are taken to be eigenvalues , which necessarily satisfy the product rule . in the latter ( p.  125 ) , the product rule is explicitly assumed .    on reading hardy s and related arguments ,",
    "one may be tempted to question the appropriateness of conjoining a manifestly non - lorentz - invariant sufficient condition for the existence of elements of reality ( er1 ) with a requirement of lorentz invariance of some elements of reality ( li1 ) . assuming that er1 is used not only as a sufficient but also as a necessary condition",
    ", the contradiction follows in a strikingly simple way : ( a ) for the experiment under consideration , the premise of er1 , as this condition is formulated , is true in some frames and not in others .",
    "( b ) li1 says that if the consequent of er1 holds in one frame , then ( for lorentz - invariant observables ) it holds in all frames .",
    "( c ) but er1 is also a necessary condition ; therefore its premise must hold in all frames .",
    "we see that ( c ) plainly contradicts ( a ) .",
    "condition er1 involves the word `` predict '' in an essential way . in the technical context in which it is used here , just like in its normal usage , `` predict '' refers to the future .",
    "the premise of er1 assumes that we know the ( relevant ) world configuration shortly before @xmath1 in one lorentz frame , and can infer from this the result of measuring the physical quantity @xmath21 at time  @xmath1 .    because er1 refers to a specific lorentz frame , it is clearly not a relativistically invariant criterion . indeed in the hardy setup , a prediction in frame @xmath17 can become a retrodiction in @xmath16 , and vice versa .",
    "so how can we get an invariant criterion ?",
    "the answer is that , instead of specifying a hypersurface in a noninvariant way ( i.e. at constant time ) , we should use an invariant specification .",
    "the way to do this is to make use of the light cone whose apex coincides with the measurement event .",
    "the light cone , however , can be used in a number of different ways , which will have to be investigated more closely .",
    "suppose we use the backward light cone of the measurement event",
    ". a sufficient criterion for the existence of an element of reality could then be the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if from the ( relevant ) information on or inside the backward light cone of a possible measurement event @xmath46 , we can infer with certainty , or at any rate with probability one , the result of measuring a physical quantity at @xmath46 , then at that event there exists an element of reality corresponding to the physical quantity and having a value equal to the predicted measurement result .

    ". for li2 suggests that we will have elements of reality corresponding to lorentz - invariant physical quantities that will exist in some lorentz frames and not in others .",
    "another criticism of the argument , made in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , is that elements of reality are defined without sufficiently taking context into account .",
    "it is well known that in theories involving hidden variables , their values depend on context , for instance on what specific observable is being measured far away . in hardy s setup",
    ", one can measure different observables related to the positron and the electron , by removing the mirrors bs2@xmath3 and bs2@xmath2 .",
    "however , cohen and hiley  @xcite pointed out that to carry out the argument , hardy only uses a single experimental context , the one where both mirrors are in place and both detectors @xmath34 and @xmath36 fire .",
    "thus context dependence construed as above is not relevant to the analysis . on the other hand , the criterion er3 for the existence of elements of reality , and its generalization to nonlocal observables through the region @xmath49 introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , do in a quite specific sense involve context .",
    "indeed the `` relevant information '' is not the same for the local observable @xmath40 as it is for the nonlocal observable @xmath42 .",
    "the expression `` context dependence '' may therefore remain more appropriate than the expression `` observer specific '' suggested in  @xcite .",
    "cohen and hiley have also argued that the use of the projection postulate is the crux of the problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , however , we showed that although hardy formulated his argument in the language of the projection postulate , it does nt really depend on it . by using a functional - based formalism for the description of the state of a quantum - mechanical system , cohen and hiley can provide a relativistically - covariant description of whatever",
    "collapses occur in the hardy experiment . that formalism , however , does nt seem to allow for elements of reality to be introduced even when measurement results can be predicted with certainty .    vaidman  @xcite has argued that insistence on the validity of the product rule  ( [ product ] ) , on which hardy s and other arguments are based , is what prevents defining lorentz - invariant elements of reality . to show this , vaidman applied the aharonov - bergmann - lebowitz ( abl ) rule to the setup . in its original formulation  @xcite , the rule gives the probability @xmath52 that , if a system is prepared in a state @xmath53 and found in a final stage to be in a state @xmath54 , an intermediate measurement associated with a projector @xmath55 will find the result  1 : @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 project on states @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the sum in the denominator runs on a set of orthogonal projectors summing to the identity .",
    "must be evolved forwards to the time of the intermediate measurement and @xmath54 must similarly be evolved backwards . ]",
    "vaidman then shows that if @xmath53 is the state given in  ( [ pointp ] ) and @xmath59 ( i.e. the state obtained upon detection by @xmath34 and @xmath36 ) , then there is unit probability for the following three intermediate results : ( i ) @xmath40 yields 1 ; ( ii ) @xmath35 yields 1 ; and ( iii ) @xmath42 yields 0 .",
    "these probabilities are unobjectionable if the intermediate measurements are carried out .",
    "but in hardy s experiment , they are not . however , vaidman extrapolates the abl rule to counterfactual situations .",
    "he proposes to attribute elements of reality to physical quantities whose values can be deduced with certainty , on the basis of a counterfactual use of the abl rule . from the results given above ,",
    "it is clear that these elements of reality do not satisfy the product rule .",
    "can functions defined on commuting hermitian operators and not satisfying the product rule still be called elements of _ reality _ ? this is a semantical question that i shall not address , but there is no doubt that , if anything , they make for a peculiar kind of reality .",
    "cohen and hiley  @xcite have argued that the violation of the product rule entails a meaning of _ true _ which `` differs from its meaning in standard predictive quantum mechanics and in all other branches of physics . '' but the difference may not be so drastic .",
    "a proposition @xmath60 and its negation may both be true if they refer to different times , i.e.  to different contexts .",
    "as we have seen above , elements of reality are in some sense context dependent .",
    "note that an operational , albeit indirect , meaning to the violation of the product rule can in the present situation be provided by weak measurements  @xcite .",
    "cohen and hiley also objected to vaidman s counterfactual use of the abl rule , on the grounds that the observables involved do not form the basis of a consistent family of histories .",
    "it would seem , however , that this lack of a consistent family only prevents assigning to elements of reality values that can be revealed in and would be unaffected by an eventual measurement .",
    "much of the debate on the counterfactual use of the abl rule comes from the failure to realize that a number of different assertions can be made about counterfactual measurement results that are all consistent with the formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "i have argued elsewhere  @xcite that the counterfactual use of the abl rule , in situations where it is allowed , is not a consequence of the formalism of quantum mechanics , but is part of its interpretation .",
    "i should point out that vaidman s analysis corresponds to the choice indicated in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , where the value of the element of reality corresponding to the nonlocal observable @xmath42 could be deduced from information in the union @xmath48 of the regions outside the two forward light cones of the events . as he claims , it thus provides lorentz - invariant elements of reality .    in closing this section",
    ", i would like to argue for the consistency of the hellwig - kraus relativistic theory of the projection postulate , against the criticism made to it by aharonov and albert  @xcite .",
    "briefly , aharonov and albert correctly pointed out that some nonlocal observables can be measured by means of local measurements only . to illustrate this , they considered two spin 1/2 particles prepared in the singlet state and then separated at an arbitrarily large distance .",
    "next they introduced two measurement apparatus , correlated in such a way that the difference of their ( three - dimensional ) positions and the sum of their momenta are well defined .",
    "they then showed that these apparatus can be used , say at @xmath61 in some frame , to assert that each component of the two particles total spin vanishes , in a non - demolition way .",
    "now suppose that at time @xmath1 in that frame , the @xmath62-component of the spin of the left particle is measured .",
    "according to the hellwig - kraus theory , that particle s state then collapses onto @xmath63 or @xmath64 along the backward light cone of the particle .",
    "this , aharonov and albert maintain , contradicts the fact that the two - particle state is @xmath65 just before the measurement ( at @xmath61 ) .",
    "according to the hellwig - kraus theory , however , the local non - demolition measurements at @xmath61 will not collapse the nonlocal state on this equal - time hypersurface ( that would not be relativistically invariant ) , but on the union of the two particles backward light cones .",
    "hence the two - particle state @xmath65 will be valid in the region bounded by these light cones and the one coming from the measurement event of the @xmath62-spin of the left particle .",
    "hardy s and other proofs of the nonexistence of lorentz - invariant elements of reality rely in one way or another on the assumption that the element of reality associated with a product of commuting hermitian operators is the product of the elements of reality associated with each individual operator .",
    "this assumption , as shown in the appendix , constrains values of elements of reality defined on a maximal set of commuting hermitian operators .",
    "once it is removed , lorentz - invariant elements of reality can be defined using various combinations of the light cones associated with measurement events .",
    "this construction , although not necessarily involving state vector collapse , is reminiscent of the hellwig - kraus theory .",
    "the kind of context dependence involved allows for the failure of the product rule and clarifies the sense in which these elements of reality differ from what this concept usually covers .",
    "i am grateful to the natural science and engineering research council of canada for financial support .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank simon lvesque for discussions on a related topic which stimulated some of the thoughts presented here .",
    "my thanks also go to andrew laidlaw for comments , and to two anonymous referees for insightful remarks .",
    "in this section i address the question of finding real - valued functions , on a maximal set of commuting hermitian operators , that satisfy the product rule .",
    "let @xmath66 be a complex vector space of finite dimension @xmath67 , and let @xmath68 be an orthonormal basis in @xmath66 .",
    "then the set of all operators of the form @xmath69 with the @xmath70 real , is a maximal set of commuting hermitian operators .",
    "we look for real functions @xmath71 such that the product rule is satisfied , i.e. @xmath72 for any @xmath73 and @xmath74 having the form ( [ hermitian ] ) .    for any projector @xmath10 , ( [ product2 ] )",
    "implies that @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 or  1 .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the one - dimensional projector @xmath77 .",
    "all possible cases then fall into the following three disjoint collections :          let @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 . then @xmath83 and @xmath84 whence @xmath85 for all @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "for any nontrivial @xmath88 as given in  ( [ hermitian ] ) , there is a @xmath89 such that @xmath90 .",
    "but then @xmath91 note that since @xmath92 we also have @xmath93 , hence @xmath94 for all @xmath88 .",
    "now let @xmath88 be as in  ( [ hermitian ] ) .",
    "then @xmath99 moreover @xmath100 restricted to positive values of @xmath70 , ( [ flambda ] ) means that @xmath44 is a one - dimensional representation of the lie group of products of real numbers . in the exponential parametrization @xmath101 , hence representations have the form @xmath102 , where @xmath103 must be real for @xmath44 to be . to extend @xmath44 to negative values of @xmath70",
    "we can either put @xmath104 for all @xmath70 or @xmath105 for all @xmath70 .",
    "finally , for @xmath44 to remain finite as @xmath106 , the exponent @xmath103 must be nonnegative .",
    "this also follows from  ( [ f0 ] ) if @xmath44 is required to be continuous .",
    "it then follows from  ( [ fh ] ) that for all @xmath88 @xmath107 or @xmath108      we see at once that @xmath109 .",
    "it may be that there is a two - dimensional projector @xmath110 such that @xmath111 .",
    "then for any projector which is a sum of one or several @xmath112 orthogonal to @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 = f(p_i ) = 0 .\\ ] ] likewise we easily see that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "if we let @xmath118 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we find at once that ( [ product2 ] ) is satisfied for all @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it can also be satisfied with various choices similar to ( [ twodim ] ) .    if there is no two - dimensional projector @xmath113 such that @xmath111 ( and therefore @xmath121 for all @xmath122 and @xmath86 ) , it may be that there is a three - dimensional projector @xmath123 such that @xmath124 . letting latexmath:[$f(h )",

    "the same argument goes on in higher dimensions .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that this exhausts all possibilities , but i do not have a proof of this general statement .",
