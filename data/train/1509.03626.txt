    "in studies of theoretical physics , seemingly unrelated subjects of researches have been often found closely connected . in reference",
    "@xcite , it has been suggested that classifications of the following three subjects are closely related :    * gapped boundaries and domain walls in topological phases of matter . * bosonic symmetry - protected topological phases . * fault - tolerant logical gates that can be implemented by finite - depth quantum circuits in topological quantum codes .",
    "this paper is an attempt to further establish the connection among them .",
    "below , we illustrate the key ideas and summarize the main results of this paper .",
    "relations between the bulk and the boundary have been important for the understanding of quantum many - body systems .",
    "it is known that gapped boundaries in two - dimensional topological phases can be classified by sets of anyons that may condense into gapped boundaries  @xcite . by ``",
    "an anyon condenses into a gapped boundary '' , we mean that an anyonic excitation can be created and absorbed at the gapped boundary without involving any other excitations .",
    "the guiding principle for finding such sets of condensing anyons is to look for the so - called lagrangian subgroup of anyons which possess ( a ) mutually - trivial braiding statistics , ( b ) trivial self - statistics and ( c ) anyons outside the set have non - trivial mutual statistics with at least one anyon in the set  @xcite .",
    "while there have been significant progresses toward classification of gapped boundaries supported in two - dimensional topological phases , gapped boundaries in three and higher dimensions are poorly understood except for a certain special family of models  @xcite .",
    "based on the success in two dimensions , one might naively conclude that gapped boundaries in higher dimensions can be also classified by the lagrangian subgroup .",
    "it is , however , known that the boundary properties are much richer in higher dimensions ; namely , there exist gapped boundaries where excitations may condense only when superpositions of anyonic excitations are involved .",
    "the simplest realization of this exotic phenomenon is a certain gapped boundary in a three - dimensional @xmath6 topological order ( _ i.e. _ three decoupled copies of the toric code , which is also known as the topological color code in quantum information community  @xcite ) where only the composites of loop - like magnetic fluxes and loop - like superpositions of electric charges may condense  @xcite .",
    "currently a generic theoretical framework to classify gapped boundaries in higher - dimensional topological phases of matter is missing , and the necessary step would be to explore more examples .",
    "we will begin by presenting construction of gapped boundaries for the @xmath0-dimensional quantum double model with arbitrary finite group @xmath7 by using @xmath0-cocycle functions .",
    "this generalizes construction of gapped boundaries for the two - dimensional quantum double model by beigi _",
    "et al _ to higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "our construction borrows ideas from recent developments on studies of bosonic symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) phases  @xcite .",
    "formally , the system with spt order has certain global on - site symmetry @xmath7 and its non - degenerate ground state does not break any of the symmetries .",
    "a particularly interesting property is the duality between bosonic spt phases ( in the absence of time - reversal symmetry ) and intrinsic topological phases via gauging , a process of minimally coupling a system with global symmetry @xmath7 to gauge fields with gauge symmetry @xmath7  @xcite . under this duality map , a @xmath0-dimensional bosonic spt wavefunction , characterized by a @xmath8-cocycle function @xmath9 ,",
    "is mapped to a ground state of the twisted quantum double model whose braiding statistics is modified from the untwisted one according to the cocycle function @xmath10 . in this paper , we will give a precise definition of gauging by formulating it as a bijective and isometric map ( _ i.e. _ a duality map ) between wavefunctions with global symmetry and wavefunctions with gauge symmetry . our construction of gapped boundaries becomes clear by using the gauging map and the duality between intrinsic topological order and spt order .",
    "having constructed gapped boundaries in the quantum double model , we will proceed to characterization of excitations and condensations . for this problem",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath7 is an abelian group for simplicity of discussion .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0-dimensional quantum double model supports point - like electric charges and codimension-@xmath4 magnetic fluxes .",
    "what may be less familiar is that the @xmath0-dimensional quantum double model supports @xmath2-dimensional fluctuating charges ( @xmath11 ) that are superpositions of electric charges forming @xmath2-dimensional objects  @xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate that @xmath2-dimensional fluctuating charges can be characterized by @xmath2-dimensional bosonic spt wavefunctions based on @xmath12-cocycle functions .",
    "such an @xmath2-dimensional fluctuating charge , living on a boundary @xmath13 of an @xmath12-dimensional region @xmath14 , can be created by a local quantum circuit acting on @xmath14 while it can not be created by any local quantum circuit acting exclusively on @xmath13 . in this sense , these are genuine @xmath2-dimensional objects and are locally unbreakable .",
    "we shall see that the special cases for @xmath15 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath16-dimensional spt phases ) correspond to ordinary point - like electric charges .",
    "the remaining task is to find the sets of excitations that may condense into a gapped boundary . for this purpose",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the notion of slant products .",
    "formally , a slant product @xmath17 for @xmath18 is a certain map from an @xmath2-cocycle function @xmath19 to an @xmath20-cocycle function @xmath21 .",
    "note that the output of the slant product @xmath17 depends on @xmath18 .",
    "we will see that composites of a @xmath22-type magnetic flux and a codimension-@xmath4 fluctuating electric charge associated with @xmath23 may condense into a @xmath24-type gapped boundary in the @xmath0-dimensional quantum double model .",
    "we then ask what is the guiding principle for classifying sets of condensing excitations in higher - dimensional topological phases of matter .",
    "recently wang and levin have suggested that , in order to fully characterize three - dimensional topological phases of matter , three - loop braiding processes , as well as ordinary loop - loop and loop - particle braiding processes , need to be examined  @xcite .",
    "inspired by this proposal , we study the three - loop braiding processes among a loop - like fluctuating charge and a pair of loop - like magnetic fluxes in the three - dimensional quantum double model . when a loop - like @xmath25-charge and a @xmath26-type magnetic flux are braided in the presence of a @xmath27-type magnetic flux ,",
    "the resulting statistical angle is given by @xmath28 where slant products are taken sequentially .",
    "we then demonstrate that condensing excitations exhibit trivial three - loop braiding statistics .",
    "these findings seem to suggest that sets of condensing excitations in three - dimensional topological phases of matter can be classified by a subgroup of excitations ( which include both ordinary anyonic excitations and fluctuating charges ) that exhibit trivial braiding statistics , including three - loop braiding processes .",
    "our characterization also extends to the quantum double model with @xmath29 where braiding processes involve @xmath0 different types of codimension-@xmath4 excitations .",
    "finally , we shall apply the aforementioned results to classification of fault - tolerantly implementable logical gates ( which is the author s original motivation behind this paper ) .",
    "given topological quantum error - correcting codes , a long - standing open problem is to find all the logical gates that may be implemented by local quantum circuits , such as transversal implementations of unitary gates  @xcite .",
    "the hope of developing a systematic approach has been elusive so far , and solutions are known only for a few specific examples .",
    "recently bravyi and knig have found that fault - tolerantly implementable logical gates in @xmath0-dimensional topological stabilizer codes must belong to the @xmath0th level of the clifford hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "characterization of fluctuating charges and multi - excitation braiding statistics through the framework of group cohomology has interesting applications in constructing fault - tolerantly implementable logical gates .",
    "consider a @xmath5-dimensional fluctuating charge and sweep it over the entire @xmath0-dimensional quantum double model .",
    "since this process changes types of excitations , it implements some non - trivial action on the ground state space of the quantum double model , and thus is a fault - tolerant logical operation . recall that the notion of the clifford hierarchy has natural generalization for any abelian finite group @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "we find that a logical unitary , corresponding to a @xmath24-charge , is a non - trivial @xmath0th level logical gate if there exist @xmath30 such that the sequential slant product @xmath31 is non - trivial .",
    "this surprising connection between group cohomology and the clifford hierarchy can be understood from the following intuition .",
    "multi - excitation braiding processes can be expressed as sequential group commutators among codimension-@xmath32 world - sheet operators that characterize propagations of codimension-@xmath4 excitations . at the same time , sequential group commutators naturally appear in a definition of the clifford hierarchy  @xcite",
    ". our finding will allow one to find a large number of non - trivial logical gates , belonging to the higher - level of the generalized clifford hierarchy in a systematic manner , shedding a new light on theories of fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "we believe that our technique is also applicable to the twisted quantum double model with non - abelian @xmath7 .    in summary",
    ", we shall present a systematic framework of constructing gapped boundaries and fault - tolerantly implementable logical gates in the quantum double model by borrowing the idea of the gauging map utilized in studies of bosonic spt phases .",
    "along the way , we will find new types of gapped boundaries that do not fit into conventional classification scheme of gapped boundaries of topological phases .",
    "we will also see various examples of non - trivial multi - excitation braiding processes , such as three - loop braiding .",
    "the rest of the paper is dedicated to detailed descriptions of these ideas and findings .",
    "in this section , we present constructions of gapped boundaries for the @xmath0-dimensional quantum double model by using @xmath0-cocycle functions .",
