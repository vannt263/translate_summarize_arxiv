    "a central aim of nanoscale science is to controllably modify material properties on a nanometre scale .",
    "one of its greatest achievements has been manipulation of surface atomic structure with the scanning tunnelling microscope ( stm ) @xcite , and some of the most striking demonstrations of this capability the construction of complex arrays of adatoms by the maneuvering and positioning of individual adatoms @xcite . synthesized nanoscale structures such as these , as well as other surface nanostructures including islands @xcite and step arrays @xcite act as resonators for mobile surface electrons , with characteristics that may be controlled by the adjustment of geometrical parameters .    here",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the electronic structure of a particular class of resonator , surface nanocavities constructed from mn atoms on ag(111 ) . of particular interest",
    "is the extent to which a simple scattering model , which takes into account the atomic structure of the resonator , can successfully describe its spatial and spectral electron distributions .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that the specific characteristics of individual resonators impact upon the electronic structure of adsorbates positioned within them , and may open up the possibility of atomic scale control of magnetic or chemical properties .",
    "in addition , we consider the use of these artificial nanoscale structures for probing quasiparticle lifetimes close to the fermi energy . the lifetimes of excitations enter the description of many important surface phenomena such as the dynamics of charge and energy transfer , and for excitations in surface bands reflect a complex combination of decay processes via both surface - localised and extended states , with the additional influence of screening that varies rapidly as the electron density decreases outside the surface .",
    "successful prediction of lifetimes remains an on - going theoretical problem @xcite , whilst measurements must overcome considerable challenges ( reviewed in ref.@xcite ) so that only recently @xcite has a consistent account of the lifetime of a prototype quasiparticle , a hole in a surface band , been constructed , based upon tunnelling spectroscopy at the surface state band edge on noble metal ( 111 ) faces @xcite .",
    "the spatial decay of electron interference patterns observed in stm images provides an alternative approach first indicated by avouris  @xcite , and has been used to measure lifetimes well removed from the fermi energy @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , lifetime measurements for states close in energy to @xmath2 are still lacking but are of particular interest because the relative contributions of phononic and electronic decay channels are expected to change significantly in this range .",
    "we indicate how electron resonators may be used for this purpose .",
    "we study nanocavities constructed using mn adatoms on the ag ( 111 ) surface in a custom - built ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) stm , operating at a temperature of @xmath3  k @xcite .",
    "the mn atoms were evaporated onto a cold ag substrate that had been prepared by standard procedures in uhv .",
    "electrochemically etched w tips were prepared in uhv by sputtering and annealing .",
    "differential conductivity ( @xmath0 ) spectra were recorded under open feedback loop conditions using a lock - in amplifier with a sinusoidal modulation added to the sample bias .",
    "moreover , maps of @xmath0 were recorded simultaneously with constant current imaging without opening the feedback .",

    "we observe abrupt current changes at @xmath18  v and @xmath19  g@xmath7 , figure  [ atom_stability]b , indicating the onset of induced atomic mobility .",
    "to achieve acceptable signal - to - noise ratios in tunnelling spectroscopy elevated modulation amplitudes were required ( @xmath20  mv@xmath21 ) .",
    "we construct artificial structures via controlled relocation of individual mn atoms , using a sliding process pioneered by eigler @xcite .",
    "a mn adatom is moved by placing the tip over the atom at large tip - sample separation ( typically @xmath14  g@xmath7 ) , reducing this separation ( @xmath22  v , @xmath23  m@xmath7 ) and then moving the tip slowly across the surface ( a rate of @xmath24 one lattice constant per second ) to the desired location .",
    "the adatom follows the tip motion , and is left in position by retracting the tip .      to model the experiments it is important to take into account the constant - current mode of operation that is used in obtaining the @xmath0 maps .",
    "the tunnelling current is calculated as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the local density of states ( ldos ) of the sample at the position @xmath27 of the tip and where the transmission probability @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 \\label{transmissionfactor}\\ ] ] with tip - sample distance @xmath30 and workfunctions @xmath31  ev and @xmath32  ev of tip and sample respectively @xcite .",
    "simulating the feedback loop , @xmath30 was adjusted for each lateral position ( @xmath33 ) to ensure constant current @xmath34 , which in turn was numerically differentiated to obtain @xmath0 . in using ( [ tunnelcurrent ] ) we assume an electronically featureless tip , which is supported by the absence of any tip dependence to be seen during the experiments .",
    "for @xmath35 we consider an array of @xmath36 two - dimensional @xmath1-wave scatterers with coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "this is the model introduced by heller _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath35 from the green function @xmath39 which is given by multiple - scattering theory in terms of the free - electron green function @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 and the @xmath42-matrices that characterise the point scatterers : @xmath43        a number of parameters enter the calculations .",
    "we use @xmath42-matrices corresponding to perfectly absorbing scatterers , as identified by heller _",
    "et al_. @xcite and used by them to describe the @xmath0 spectrum of a 60 fe atom corral on cu(111 ) .",
    "this boundary condition reflects the strong coupling to bulk states @xcite that occurs at the adatoms .",
    "the effective mass @xmath44  @xmath45 and surface state band edge @xmath46  mev have been determined previously  @xcite .",
    "the positions of the atoms and the lateral position of the tip are crucial in determining the exact shape of @xmath0 spectra .",
    "for example , only the highest symmetry eigenstates contribute at the centre of a circular structure , but slightly off centre or if the shape is not exactly regular a mixing of state occurs , giving additional structure .",
    "uncertainty enters these coordinates through the piezo calibration and possible anisotropy of the piezo sensitivity in the fast ( @xmath47 ) and slow ( @xmath48 ) scanning directions .",
    "therefore an optimisation scheme was used based upon a @xmath49 fit using the levenberg - marquardt method in which the relative coordinates were fixed but independently scaled in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions .",
    "after the initial determination , the piezo calibration parameters were held fixed in all subsequent calculations . in a second stage ,",
    "the calculations have been extended further to include an energy dependent lifetime of the electronic states ( sect .",
    "[ qwertz ] ) .",
    "this was accomplished via a parameterised imaginary self energy @xmath50 added to the energy @xmath51 in computing @xmath52 from equations ( [ freeg])-([t ] ) .",
    "the importance of the self energy in determining the peak amplitudes and widths in the ldos has been noted previously @xcite .",
    "here we exploit this dependence to extract @xmath53 from experimental data .",
    "figure  [ box_pics ] displays data from an array of @xmath54 mn adatoms .",
    "images a  h are constant current topographs covering a range of different voltages , recorded at values indicated in the figure .",
    "the adatoms , which appear as bright protrusions in every case , have been arranged into a rectangular geometry with approximate dimensions of @xmath55  @xmath4 . inside this structure",
    "a weak corrugation is found , originating from the confinement of the surface state electrons .",
    "a nonlinear height scale has been used for display , in order to render this weak corrugation easily discernible ; this has the side effect that the adatoms appear rather blunt . at negative voltages ( i.e. when tunnelling from occupied levels in the sample ) the constant current topographs exhibit a rectangular pattern of four maxima within the confining array of mn atoms , which is still discernible at voltages well below the bottom of the surface state band at @xmath56  mev .",
    "this pattern persists owing to the preferential tunnelling from occupied states at the fermi level . at positive voltages ,",
    "imaging unoccupied states , the pattern becomes more complex and varies with @xmath57 , the most significant tunnelling now occuring at energies corresponding to the varying bias voltage .",
    "images i  p show @xmath0 maps that were recorded simultaneously with the topographic scans .",
    "below @xmath58 , the adatoms cause clear features , whereas no corrugation is discernible inside the array .",
    "in contrast , above @xmath58 a clear wave pattern arises within the structure , while the adatoms are only weak features which conveniently serve to indicate the rectangular boundary .",
    "the evolution with energy of the internal pattern is as expected , representing a progression through the nodal structures of the lowest lying `` particle - in - a - box '' eigenstates of the rectangular cavity , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the linear dimensions of the structure . at low energy , fig.[box_pics]j , a single",
    "maximum occurs ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "next , two maxima appear along the longer axis of the rectangle ( fig .",
    "[ box_pics]k ) , corresponding to the @xmath63 level .",
    "the @xmath64  mv map ( fig.[box_pics]l ) showing four maxima , two along each axis of the rectangle , reflects contributions from both the second ( @xmath63 ) and third ( @xmath65 ) levels .",
    "the states are in reality resonances that in general overlap in energy , so that @xmath0 maps can contain contributions from several . at higher energies ,",
    "the pattern becomes increasingly complex .",
    "calculated results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ box_theo ] where panels a  g are topographs , h",
    " n are @xmath0 maps and o - u are ldos maps .",
    "close inspection and comparison with figs.[box_pics]b - h , and [ box_pics]j - p reveals that the experimental features are reproduced well by the model calculations .",
    "as pointed out previously  @xcite , experimental @xmath0 data recorded by the methods used here are affected by the variations in tip - sample separation which give rise to the corrugation in the topographs . consequently @xmath0 maps are not directly comparable to ldos maps , a fact clearly visible by comparing figs .",
    "[ box_theo]l and s , or [ box_theo]m and t , although the similarity between the two tends to increase with increasing bias voltages .",
    "indeed , around zero bias it is topographs and not @xmath0 that are are expected to resemble the ldos , and this is clearly the case in fig .",

    "right : @xmath0 spectrum and theoretical ldos of a @xmath66    diameter ring of 35 mn adatoms . ]",
    "a more detailed comparison between experiment and theory is possible in the case of @xmath0 spectra .",
    "an example measured near the centre of the rectangular resonator is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ box_spex ] . tunneling from a @xmath1-state tip directly at the centre of an ideal rectangular structure",
    "can only take place into surface state levels with odd quantum numbers @xmath67 .",
    "this is the origin of the large peaks at @xmath68 mev and between @xmath69 and @xmath70  mev .",
    "irregularities in the structure and deviations in position of the tip from the the exact centre introduce additional weak tunneling channels , e.g. near @xmath71 mev , whilst the intrinsic width of the confined levels further modifies the spectrum . comparing the measured spectrum with",
    "the ldos calculated using the two - dimensional scattering model that includes the structural irregularities and correct tip position , displayed in the same panel in fig .",
    "[ box_spex ] , we see the latter faithfully reproduces the differential conductivity spectrum .",
    "note that the characteristic temperature associated with kondo behaviour in mn / ag alloys is @xmath72  mk  @xcite and thus does not affect the line shape @xcite under the present experimental conditions .",
    "we have also performed similar experiments and calculations on other geometries , such as adatom rings .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ box_spex ] contains a comparison between the differential conductivity spectrum , measured approximately @xmath20    off centre in a @xmath66    diameter ring formed from 35 mn adatoms , and the corresponding ldos obtained using the @xmath1-wave scattering model .",
    "the spectrum contains a large number of peaks , the off - centre position enabling low symmetry eigenstates to provide channels for tunnelling , but these are reproduced in the theoretical ldos spectrum calculated using the precise atomic positions of the mn ring .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath1-wave scattering model provides an adequate basis for modelling the spatial and spectral electron distributions in electron resonators .",

    "having characterised the properties of electron resonators we have next investigated the interaction with an additional atom introduced into the nanocavity region .",
    "these structures were formed by maneuvering one of the boundary mn atoms into the central region , and then moving a mn atom elsewhere on the surface into the vacant position in the boundary , restoring the integrity of the resonator .    in figure [ full_empty ]",
    "we show @xmath0 maps of a rectangular structure made from 28 mn atoms and measured at three different voltages , contrasting the images obtained with and without a mn atom inside the structure . at first glance the presence of the central atom appears to barely affect the wave pattern inside the rectangle , apart from in the immediate vicinity of the centre atom .",
    "there , the difference is striking . at voltages of @xmath73  mv and @xmath74  mv where @xmath0 is at a minimum in the empty structure ( figs .",
    "[ full_empty]g and i ) , @xmath0 exhibits a peak in the centre upon insertion of the atom ( figs .",

    "the vertical dashed lines mark the energies of the main spectral features present at the centre of the empty structure . ]",
    "this `` contrast reversal '' has been previously reported and explained as a consequence of the strong hybridisation between states on the mn atom and substrate surface electron levels  @xcite , and has been reproduced in calculations of the local density of states directly on mn atoms in resonators of various geometries using full three - dimensional multiple scattering calculations . here",
    "we consider how this interaction extends away from the central mn atom and the degree to which the two - dimensional scattering model describes the behaviour .",
    "[ abstands_kurve80 ] shows a series of @xmath0 spectra measured at various distances from the centre of an empty adatom ring , and when a mn atom has been introduced .",
    "also shown are the ldos calculations for identical geometries . comparing @xmath0 spectra in figs .",
    "[ abstands_kurve80]a and b at central positions closest to the location of the new adatom , it is clear that spectral peaks in the empty resonator coincide with troughs of the occupied structure ( vertical dashed lines ) .",
    "this is evidence for strong hybridisation @xcite . moving laterally away from this central position the characteristic peak structure of the empty resonator returns , with the exception of the lowest peak near @xmath77  mv which remains absent even at large displacements .",
    "this prominent feature is associated with a nodeless resonator eigenstate that has its maximum at the centre of the ring , and so is particularly sensitive to the introduction of a mn atom into the central region .",
    "the two right - most panels in fig .",
    "[ abstands_kurve80 ] show the ldos calculated for this system using the two - dimensional scattering model , at lateral positions at which @xmath0 spectra were recorded .",
    "the prominent features in the experimental spectra are reproduced well in the theoretical curves , again showing that the simple scattering model , using the exact atomic locations of the mn atoms making up the structure , gives an accurate and valid account of the electronic structure of resonators .",
    "the calculations also confirm that the dominant state in the empty resonator is absent in the spectrum of states of the occupied resonator , so that the insensitivity of @xmath0 maps to the presence of the central atom away from its immediate vicinity that was suggested by fig .",
    "[ full_empty ] clearly does not extend to all sample voltages .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ abstands_kurve80]d we have omitted theoretical spectra within @xmath78     of the central mn atom . within this radius ( which is much greater than the topographic radius of the mn atoms )",
    "the differential conductivity also has large contributions from channels involving bulk states scattered by the adatom @xcite , and these are not included in the model .",
    "also omitted in the model is any spatial information about the adatom orbitals that would also be required to model @xmath0 spectra ( and maps ) in its immediate vicinity .",
    "the basic idea of our approach to lifetime measurements is straightforward @xcite .",
    "exploiting the properties of the electron resonators identified in the previous sections we construct nanocavities with electronic features in the vicinity of @xmath2 .",
    "the lineshape of the spectral features are affected by lifetime - limiting processes so that through analysis the lifetime @xmath79 can be determined . by changing the geometry of nanoscale structures it is possible to tune the eigenstate energies of the structures , and thus generate states at various energies in order to obtain the energy dependence of the lifetime .",
    "the two - dimensional scattering model validated above enables the design of suitable structures .",
    "we note that a fully quantitative analysis will also require information on the energy dependence of the tip density of states , which is not expected to be constant over a wide energy range , and likewise the bulk density of states of the crystal which causes a background signal in @xmath0 spectra . here",

    "the high symmetry gives the `` cleanest '' spectrum , avoiding difficulties that exist at off - centre positions where resonances can overlap .",
    "with increasing @xmath53 there is a reduction of the peak heights and a concomitant broadening , especially apparent for the lowest of the states which have the sharpest intrinsic profile .",
    "these trends are quantified by fitting a series of lorentzians to the data , and figure  [ ei_theory]b and c display the widths and height extracted through this analysis . as @xmath53 increases , the peak heights decrease monotonically , the lowest ( in energy ) peaks most rapidly , whilst there is an essentially linear dependence of the peak width on @xmath53 .",
