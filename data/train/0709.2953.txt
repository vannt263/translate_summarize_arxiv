    "quantum information theory@xcite studies transmission and manipulation of information in systems that must be treated quantum mechanically , and it is markedly different from classical information theory@xcite in which the capacity of a classical discrete memoryless channel is uniquely given by a single numerical value representing the amount of information that can be transmitted asymptotically without error per channel use .",
    "moreover , this value is unaffected by the use of classical feedback . however , for quantum discrete memoryless channels , capacities are affected by side classical communication and shared entanglements@xcite .",
    "in addition , we can use a quantum channel to transmit either classical or quantum information and therefore we can define , for every quantum discrete memoryless channel , various capacities : @xmath4 , unassisted classical capacity ; @xmath5 , classical capacity assisted by classical feedback ; @xmath6 , classical capacity assisted by independent classical information ; @xmath7 , entanglement - assisted classical capacity ; @xmath8 , unassisted quantum capacity ; @xmath2 , quantum capacity assisted by classical feedback ; @xmath1 , quantum capacity assisted by independent classical information ; and finally @xmath9 , entanglement - assisted quantum capacity .",
    "so far , some progress has been made to compute the capacities for specific channels@xcite .",
    "however , search for a general formula only succeeded in a few cases@xcite , and progress in this direction has been hindered by the additivity conjecture@xcite .",
    "while we are far from obtaining a formula for all these capacities , a natural question to ask is whether we can relate these capacities .",
    "some relations such as @xmath10 are trivial but others can be hard .",
    "some capacities are even incomparable , i.e. depending on the channel , either one may be greater than the other . for the comparable capacities , we also want to show whether the inequalities are strict or saturable",
    ". our present knowledge of these relations is summarized in @xcite .",
    "one of the conjectural relations is @xmath3 , that there exist quantum channels whose quantum capacity assisted by two - way classical communication exceeds their quantum capacity assisted by classical feedback .",
    "while we can not prove the conjecture , the aim of this work is to define , for any quantum discrete memoryless channel , a quantity called quantum entanglement capacity with classical feedback ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we show that this capacity lies between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and it has two different well - defined operational meanings . for the quantum depolarizing channel ,",
    "we demonstrate a general scheme to convert quantum error - correcting codes ( qecc ) into @xmath0 protocols , and these in turn imply new lower bounds on the quantum capacity with classical feedback ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this work is also closely related to entanglement purification protocols ( epp)@xcite , procedures by which two parties can extract pure - state entanglement out of some shared mixed entangled states . for example ,    @xmath11    are the so - called bell basis and each of these states is considered equivalent to an ebit , a basic unit of entanglement in quantum information theory . at the beginning of these entanglement purification protocols ,",
    "two persons alice and bob share a large number of the generalized werner states@xcite    @xmath12    say @xmath13 , and they are allowed to communicate classically , apply unitary transformations and perform projective measurements . in the end the quantum states @xmath14 shared by alice and bob are to be a close approximation of the maximally entangled states @xmath15 , or more precisely we require the fidelity between @xmath14 and @xmath15 approaches one as @xmath16 goes to infinity .",
    "we then define the yield of such protocols to be @xmath17 .",
    "entanglement purification protocols ( epp ) are further divided into 1-epp and 2-epp according to whether the sender and receiver are allowed to communicate uni- or bi - directionally .",
    "one of the main reasons why this is considered general is the equivalence between an entanglement purification protocol on the werner state @xmath18 and a protocol to faithfully transmit quantum states through the @xmath19-depolarizing channel established in @xcite .",
    "a @xmath20-depolarizing channel is a simple qubit channel such that a qubit passes through the channel undisturbed with probability @xmath20 and outputs as a completely random qubit with probability @xmath21 .",
    "specifically , the yield of a 1-epp on the werner state @xmath18 is equal to the unassisted quantum capacity of a @xmath19-depolarizing channel ( @xmath8 ) ; and the yield of a 2-epp on the werner state @xmath18 is equal to the quantum capacity assisted by two - way classical communication of a @xmath19-depolarizing channel ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the equivalence was proved by noting that the epr pair @xmath22 becomes the werner state @xmath18 if alice passes the second half through the @xmath19-depolarizing channel .",
    "the present study of the amount of entanglements alice and bob can share by using the depolarizing channel and classical feedback is clearly related , and we will exploit the similarities and differences to obtain new results and ask new questions .      in section [ sec : previous ] , we review some previous entanglement purification protocols that will be used in this paper . in section [ sec",
    ": e_b - between ] , we define a new quantity called quantum entanglement capacity with classical feedback ( @xmath0 ) and this quantity is shown to lie between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will then give an alternate operational meaning of @xmath0 .",
    "in section [ sec : aqecc ] , we describe how one can turn a qecc into an @xmath0 protocol and illustrate the idea with cat ( repetition ) code and shor code .",
    "we then connect the present notion to the modified recurrence method and leung - shor method . in section [ sec : new - q_b ]",
    ", we compute new lower bounds on @xmath2 implied by these @xmath0 protocols .",
    "finally , we conclude with a characteristic of the threshold of cat code and other further research directions .",
    "universal hashing , introduced in @xcite , requires only one - way classical communication and hence is a 1-epp .",
    "the hashing method works by having alice and bob each perform some local unitary operations on the corresponding members of the shared bipartite quantum states .",
    "they then locally measure some of the pairs to gain classical information about the identities of the the remaining unmeasured pairs .",
    "it was shown that each measurement can be made to reveal almost 1 bit of information about the unmeasured bell states pairs .",
    "since the information associated with a quantum state @xmath18 is given by its von neumann entropy @xmath23 , we know from typical subspace argument that , with probability approaching 1 and by measuring @xmath24 pairs , alice and bob can figure out the identities of all pairs including the unmeasured ones . once the identities of the bell states are known , alice and bob can convert them into the standard states @xmath25 easily .",
    "therefore this protocol distills a yield of @xmath26 .",
    "the recurrence method.,width=226 ]    the recurrence method@xcite is illustrated in figure [ fig : 1-recurrence ] .",
    "alice and bob put the quantum states @xmath13 into groups of two and apply xor operations to the corresponding members of the quantum states @xmath27 , one as the source and one as the target .",
    "they then take projective measurements on the target states along the z - axis , and compare their measurement results with the side classical communication channel .",
    "if they get identical results , the source pair  passed \" ; otherwise the source pair",
    " failed \" .",
    "alice and bob then collect all the  passed \" pairs , and iterate this process until it becomes more beneficial to pass on to the universal hashing . if we denote the quantum states by @xmath28 , then this protocol has the following recurrence relation :     @xmath29    and     @xmath30    this is known as the recurrence method .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , c. macchiavello has found that if we apply a unilateral @xmath31 rotation @xmath32 followed by a bilateral @xmath33 rotation @xmath34 , faster convergence is achieved and this is known as the modified recurrence method .",
    "computationally , one has to switch the @xmath35 and @xmath36 components after each recurrence .",
    "the leung - shor method.,width=226 ]    the leung - shor method@xcite is illustrated in figure [ fig : 2-ls ] .",
    "alice and bob share the quantum states @xmath13 and put them into groups of four .",
    "they then apply the quantum circuit shown in figure [ fig : 2-ls ] and take measurements on the third and fourth pairs along the x- and z - axis respectively . using the side classical communication channel",
    ", they can compare their results with each other .",
    "if they get identical results on both measurements , they keep the first and second pairs and apply universal hashing@xcite . if either of the two results disagrees , they throw away all four pairs .",
    "the four pairs can be described by an 8-bit binary string as in ( [ eqn : bell states ] ) , and since these are mixed states they are in fact probability distribution over all @xmath37 possible 8-bit binary strings .",
    "the quantum circuit consists only of xor gates and therefore maps the 8-bit binary strings , along with their underlying probability distribution , bijectively to themselves .",
    "if we let the probability distributions before and after the quantum gates to be @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , then the yield of this method is :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the  pass \" probability , @xmath42 is the post - measurement probability distribution and @xmath43 is the shannon entropy function .",
    "in this section , we define , for any quantum discrete memoryless channel , a quantity called quantum entanglement capacity with classical feedback @xmath0 . we will show that this quantity is less than the quantum capacity with two - way classical communication @xmath1 and is greater than the quantum capacity with classical feedback @xmath2 .",
    "quantum entanglement capacity with classical feedback of a qdmc can be loosely described as the maximal asymptotic rate at which the sender alice can share the entangled state @xmath44 with the receiver bob with the assistance of a classical feedback channel .",
    "precisely , let the qdmc be described by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is a set of linear operators which map the input hilbert space @xmath48 to the output hilbert space @xmath49 .",
    "then in the first round of any @xmath0 protocols , alice prepares a quantum state @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the hilbert space representing the ancilla system in her laboratory and she sends the first part of the quantum state to bob via the quantum channel @xmath52 :    @xmath53    after sending @xmath54 , alice s quantum system is described by @xmath55 . on the other hand , bob is now in possession of the quantum state @xmath56 he just received from alice as well as the ancilla system in his laboratory , and therefore his quantum system can be described by @xmath57 .",
    "next bob performs local quantum operation on his quantum system :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 . bob then uses the feedback channel to send classical information to alice .",
    "note that if bob s operation comprised quantum measurements , this classical information could include the measurement results@xmath60 .",
    "upon learning the classical information sent by bob , alice s quantum system transforms from @xmath61 to @xmath62 and she performs operation on her quantum system :    @xmath63    note that both the quantum system @xmath62 and alice s operation @xmath64 are dependent on the classical information(i ) she received from bob .",
    "this is the end of the first round of any general @xmath0 protocols and can be summarized as :    @xmath65    the second round of the protocols starts with alice holding @xmath66 and bob holding @xmath67 .",
    "after @xmath16 rounds of protocols as seen in figure [ fig : q_b - protocol ] , we require the fidelity between the quantum state shared between alice and bob , @xmath68 , and the quantum state , @xmath69 , to approach 1 as @xmath16 goes to infinity",
    ". then we define @xmath70 to be the supremum of any attainable @xmath71 - or simply @xmath17 if @xmath72 .",
    "note that in this work , when we discuss an @xmath0 protocol , for brevity , we often say to compute the @xmath0 associated with the protocol rather than to compute the lower bounds on @xmath70 impled by the protocol .",
    "an @xmath0 protocols for channel @xmath52(see the text for details).,height=831 ]      to show @xmath73 , we simply convert any @xmath0 protocol to a @xmath1 protocol with the same rate .",
    "suppose we have a protocol on @xmath52 and this @xmath70 protocol achieves @xmath71 , then at the end of this protocol alice and bob share the quantum state @xmath74 .",
    "alice now uses the forward classical communication channel to teleport any quantum state @xmath75 and therefore this new @xmath76 protocol achieves @xmath71 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath2 protocols are more restricted than @xmath0 protocols because in defining quantum capacities@xcite the sender is required to not only transmit the quantum state @xmath78 but also preserve its entanglement with the environment to which neither the sender nor the receiver has access . in @xmath0 protocols ,",
    "the sender is required to transmit half of the maximally entangled states @xmath79 and is in possession of the other half which she can manipulate in her laboratory .",
    "concisely , one can convert any @xmath2 protocol to an @xmath0 protocol as follows : alice prepares @xmath80 in her laboratory and performs the @xmath2 protocol on @xmath81 . at the end of the protocol ,",
    "alice and bob share the bipartite quantum state @xmath82 and hence @xmath83 .      in section [ sec : e_b - definition ]",
    ", @xmath0 was defined as the maximal asymptotic rate at which alice shares the singlet state @xmath84 with bob with the assistance of a classical feedback channel .",
    "alternatively , we can associate @xmath0 with a different operational meaning , namely the asymptotic rate at which bob can send quantum states to alice .",
    "this is because after any @xmath0 protocols alice and bob share the quantum states @xmath85 and there is a classical channel from bob to alice .",
    "therefore , bob can teleport any quantum states @xmath86 to alice and this achieves the same yield @xmath71 if we normalize by the dimension of the output hilbert space or if we assume the input hilbert space and the output hilbert space are of the same size .",
    "trivially , if bob can send quantum states to alice , bob can choose to send half of the epr pair @xmath84",
    ". therefore these two notions are equivalent to one another .",
    "in quantum error - correcting codes@xcite , quantum states are encoded into the subspace of some larger hilbert space .",
    "although it has been discovered that quantum states can more generally be encoded into a subsystem rather than a subspace@xcite , we focus only on subspace encoding .",
    "our aim is to convert any quantum error - correcting codes ( qecc ) to new adaptive @xmath0 protocols on the quantum depolarizing channel @xmath87 . in section [ sec : stabilizer ] , we briefly review the stabilizer formalism ; and in section [ sec : e_b - protocol ] we introduce the idea of aqecc . in the rest of the section , we will illustrate with and compute the @xmath88 for two qecc , namely the cat code and shor code .",
    "we then consider how the recurrence methods - a 2-epp - in [ sec : recurrence - method-1 ] can be turned into an @xmath0 protocol .",
    "finally we explain that the leung - shor method@xcite in [ sec : ls ] is in fact an @xmath0 protocol",
    ".      we will briefly review stabilizer formalism and introduce some notations .",
    "a clear and detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xmath89 denotes the pauli group on @xmath90 qubits , and therefore consists of the n - fold tensor products of pauli matrices .",
    "for example ,    @xmath91    where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we use subscripts to denote the qubit that a pauli matrix acts on .",
    "for example , @xmath95 means @xmath96 .",
    "generators of a subgroup @xmath97 are independent if for any @xmath98 ,    @xmath99    we say a vector space @xmath100 is stabilized by a subgroup @xmath97 if for any @xmath101 and for any @xmath102 ,    @xmath103    the following lemma can be shown easily :    let @xmath104 be generated by @xmath105 independent and commuting elements from @xmath89 , and @xmath106 . then @xmath107 is a @xmath108-dimensional vector space .    therefore to specify a @xmath108-dimensional subspace for error - correcting codes , we only need to specify @xmath105 independent generators @xmath109",
    ". however we still need to specify the logical basis vectors @xmath110 within @xmath107 . in this work",
    ", we only deal with codes where @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to specify the logical @xmath112 and logical @xmath113 such that @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "note that in doing so , we indirectly specify @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "recall the aim of any @xmath0 protocols is for alice to share the bipartite state @xmath120 with bob .",
    "we will explain our idea of turning a qecc to an @xmath0 protocol in two steps .",
    "the first step is to simply encode half of the epr pair @xmath84 in an @xmath121 $ ] stabilizer code , one that encodes a qubit in an @xmath122-dimensional hilbert space @xmath123 .",
    "alice performs the encoding     @xmath124    and then sends the @xmath90 qubits through the @xmath20-depolarizing channel     @xmath125    since the error elements of the @xmath20-depolarizing channel are pauli matrices , alice can choose the logical basis states ( or alternatively the logical operators @xmath126 as we explained in the previous section ) in such a way that after the error - correction operation @xmath127 , the encoded qubit has either an @xmath128 error , a @xmath129 error , a @xmath130 error or no error . since @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133",
    ", the bipartite state between alice and bob will be a probabilistic mixture of the four bell states .",
    "therefore bob can use the classical feedback channel to perform universal hashing and distill perfect epr pairs @xmath134 .",
    "this first step is illustrated in figure [ fig : qecc - protocol-1 ] .",
    "encoding half of the epr pair @xmath84 with a qecc .,width=566 ]    the second step is to modify what has just been described so as to achieve a higher rate .",
    "recall an @xmath121 $ ] stabilizer code is described by the generators of a subgroup @xmath135 .",
    "the error - correcting operation @xmath127 performed by bob involves measuring the observables @xmath136 since they are all tenser products of pauli matrices acting on n qubits .",
    "note that , however , many of the @xmath137 s have identity action on all but a few qubits . for example , in 9-bit shor code , @xmath138(@xmath139 ) . also , whenever a measurement result ` -1 ' is obtained , it means some errors have occurred . in the case of shor code , if bob takes a measurement on the first two qubits immediately after he receives them from alice and the measurement result is ` -1 ' , it is better for bob to use the classical feedback channel to inform alice that some errors have occurred in the first 2 qubits and they should give up this block of transmission and start all over .",
    "it is because the quantum state @xmath140 alice and bob obtained after n channel uses and decoding will be more mixed - or in other words of higher entropy - if some errors have occurred .",
    "it is thus more economical to not continue with this particular block of codes and give up the few qubits that have already been transmitted .",
    "it is thus important to arrange the order of the measurements @xmath141 such that it only involves as few more qubits as possible when one goes down the list . so that when an error is detected early on , alice and bob can stop the block and start all over so as to save more channel uses .",
    "for example , the generators of shor code can be arranged as follows :     @xmath142    it is conceivable that after a large portion of the qubits in a block have been transmitted , it is better to continue even if an error is detected",
    ". it is indeed the case for shor code when the probability parameter @xmath20 of the channel @xmath87 is large . in the next two sections",
    ", we will apply this aqecc idea to cat code and shor code , and compute the lower bounds on @xmath88 implied by these codes .",
    "the n - bit cat ( repetition ) code is an @xmath121 $ ] stabilizer code with the following generators     @xmath143    and we choose the following logical operators     @xmath144    this in turn determines the logical computational basis    @xmath145    therefore , the singlet state @xmath146 is encoded as @xmath147 in alice s laboratory .",
    "alice will send the last n qubits to bob via the channel @xmath87 . in accordance with the aqecc idea in the previous section",
    ", alice sends the first two qubits first and bob takes the measurement @xmath148 .",
    "if the measurement result is ` -1 ' , bob will inform alice of the result via the classical feedback channel and alice will discard the n-1 qubits remaining in her laboratory and start all over by encoding another epr pair and sending the quantum states . if the measurement result is ` + 1 ' , bob will inform alice of the result and alice will continue to send the third qubit .",
    "bob will then measure @xmath149 .",
    "this continues until all n qubits are passed to bob and bob gets ` + 1 ' in all n-1 measurements @xmath150 .",
    "alice and bob will then process a bipartite quantum state @xmath151 that is bell diagonal .",
    "if alice and bob repeat the process until they share n copies of @xmath140 , i.e. @xmath152 , they can perform universal hashing on these states and they will have @xmath153 epr pairs @xmath22 .",
    "however we are interested in the yield per channel use .",
    "let @xmath154 .",
    "then the average number of channel uses needed before we successfully pass a block of n - qubit cat code through the depolarizing channel is given by     @xmath155    from this , the number of epr pairs per channel use is     @xmath156    4-bit cat code in the language of entanglement purification protocols .",
    "note that in our protocols if bob s measurement results do not agree with alice s , then not all qubits will be sent through @xmath87 .",
    "alice s measurement results are assumed to be all ` + 1 ' so alice need not send bob any classical information even though bob ` compares ' his results against alices(see the text for details).,height=226 ]    we now present how to calculate the probabilities @xmath157 and the quantum state @xmath158 .",
    "the computation can be given by a simple recurrence relation @xcite which can be understood more easily in the language of entanglement purification protocols .",
    "owing to the formal equivalence between measuring half of a bell state and preparing a qubit , the encoding and decoding of the cat code can be viewed as a 1-epp as shown in figure [ fig : cat - protocol ] for @xmath159 .",
    "note that in order for the purification protocols to work , it appears alice has to send her measurement results to bob via a side forward communication channel as in 2-epp .",
    "this is in fact not the case because even though the measurement results are non - deterministic , alice can perform the measurements before she sends the 4 qubits ( or generally n qubits ) .",
    "one can pretend alice takes measurements for as many times as needed until she gets all ` + 1 ' before she sends the other halves of the quantum states via @xmath87 .",
    "therefore alice need not tell bob the results because bob already knew the results were all ` + 1 ' .",
    "( of course , in reality , alice can apply unitary operation in her laboratory to transform the states to what she needs even if some measurement results are ` -1 ' . )    lower bounds on @xmath88 via n - bit cat code and modified cat code .",

    "we are only interested in its quantum state if the measuring result is ` + 1 ' , since we otherwise discard the states and start all over .",

    "modified cat code differs from cat code in the same way that the modified recurrence method differs from the recurrence method .",
    "namely , bob switches the @xmath167 and @xmath168 components in the probabilistic mixture of bell states after each measurement .",

    "the logical operators and logical computational basis states are as follows :     @xmath169     @xmath170    as aforementioned , for 9-bit shor code , the optimal aqecc protocols are slightly different for different levels of noise .",
    "we can divide the protocols into 3 regions : +   +    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + in the first region ( p less than 0.75 ) , one only has to enumerate all @xmath171 error possibilities in the 9 channel uses and adds up all probabilities associated with having an @xmath128 error , a @xmath129 error , a @xmath130 error or no error on the encoded qubit .",

    "we will illustrate with the third region , and the computation for the second region is similar . since alice and bob will start all over if any of the first 4 measurement results is ` -1 ' , there are only @xmath174 possible measurement results given that the whole block of 9 qubits were sent through the channel .",
