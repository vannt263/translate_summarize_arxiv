    "heterogeneous epitaxy is a widely exploited technique to fabricate artificial materials , since it allows to introduce a controlled degree of distortion of the interatomic bond length and orientation , which finally allows one to tune the electronic properties of nanostructured devices . in the case of semiconductors ,",
    "the strain of a film growing on a heterogeneous substrate can be retained up to a thickness of several hundreds of nanometers ( coherent growth ) . beyond this critical thickness",
    ", the strain is released through the formation of a pattern of misfit dislocations , which propagate from the interface to the surface and drive the gradual relaxation ( decoherence ) of the growing film to its bulk structure .",
    "thanks to the high degree of long range order , the mechanism for semiconductor decoherence can be followed and described in much detail.@xcite while a reduced misfit is required for coherent semiconductor growth , thin artificial phases with a lattice structure much different from the bulk one can be stabilized for metal film growth . in the case of oxide substrates , the decoherence of metal films through and ordered network of misfit dislocations is usually observed when the misfit does not exceed @xmath0  10  % .@xcite on the other hand , the metal bonding allows the strain to be released on a much smaller thickness scale , thus reducing the average domain size of the growing film , i.e. the probability of detecting any long range order behaviour .",
    "things are getting more complicated when metal on metal heteroepitaxy is considered , since intermixing phenomena have also to be taken into account , which can either favour the stabilization of pseudomorphic films via surfactant effect ( like for the fe / au(100 ) system@xcite ) or inhibit the coherent growth via substrate roughening and alloying ( like for the co / cu(111 ) system@xcite ) .    in the past ten years",
    ", metal heteroepitaxy has been widely applied to study magnetic systems , since the magnetic behavior of metals ( both spin orientation and magnetic moment)@xcite and their chemical reactivity can be modified by appropriate distortion of their lattice structure .",
    "these metastable artificial phases are decomposed into their ground structural phase when the films exceed a critical thickness of a few layers .",
    "these transformations are usually observed to be rather sharp and occur through a rather abrupt non - diffusive distortion mechanism , which is accompanied by a strong morphological reorganization , like for the much studied fe / cu(100 ) system,@xcite thus smearing the mechanisms of domain growth .    in fact ,",
    "most of the studies have been performed by means of leed , ion scattering and stm , i.e. surface sensitive techniques .",
    "the behavior of the interface and of the layers beneath the surface is poorly known and is usually obtained by photoelectron diffraction ( xpd ) experiments at a synchrotron facility , where the photoelectron kinetic energy can be effectively tuned to change the penetration depth . on the other hand ,",
    "xpd data require a rather complex analysis , whose reliability is hampered when the number of scatterers ( penetration depth ) is increased.@xcite grazing incidence x - ray diffraction ( gixrd ) is certainly the best suited technique to study the structure of a buried interface and the layered structure of thin films.@xcite recently , a combination of xpd and gixrd techniques has been applied to study the structural dependence on thickness of fe films on cu@xmath1au(100 ) from a pseudomorphic phase to the bcc one.@xcite the structural transformation has been shown to be characterized by phase coexistence over a thickness range of a few monolayers .",
    "hereafter , we have applied gixrd to study the structure of thin ni films grown on pd(100 ) .",
    "the epitaxial growth of ultrathin ni films on the pd(100 ) surface has been recently studied by means of leed , xps and xpd with a laboratory x - ray source.@xcite this study has shown that in the early stages of the deposition there is the formation of a tetragonally strained face centered ( fct ) ni phase with the same lateral lattice spacing of the substrate ( i.e. 3.89   ) and a vertical compression of 0.24   .",
    "when the film thickness exceeds a critical value of approximately 9 - 12 layers , the film transforms into its bulk - like ni fcc structure ( lattice parameter of 3.52   ) .",
    "the measured strain of the fct phase is found to be in full agreement with the elasticity theory , but some open questions still remain . in particular , although capable to measure very nicely the tetragonal strain adopted by the ni film , the xpd data did not yield any clear information on how the phase transition develops as the critical thickness is approached nor it was straightforward to extract information on the film / substrate interface .",
    "for all these reasons we decided to perform a more detailed study on this system taking advantage of the unique possibilities to acquire both xps , xpd and gixrd data offered by the aloisa beamline at elettra synchrotron ( trieste italy ) .    an effective critical thickness for the pseudomorphic growth has been found .",
    "the transformation into the ni bulk - like structure is shown to involve the interface as well , where the intermixing increases .",
    "in addition , the number of layers in the residual pseudomorphic fct phase does not change during the transformation , but simply its domains shrink .",
    "the transformation thus proceeds via lateral growth of the bulk - like ni phase .",
    "the increase of the intermixing beyond the critical thickness is attributed to the lateral propagation of the defects , which drive the transformation of the pseudomorphic phase .",
    "both electron spectroscopy and x - ray surface diffraction measurements have been performed in situ at the aloisa beamline , where a wide photon energy range ( 130 - 8000  ev ) , coupled to a multiple detection system , is available.@xcite the uhv experimental chamber ( base pressure in the 10@xmath2  mbar range ) hosts hemispherical electron analyzers and x - ray detectors .",
    "the emission direction from the sample surface can be freely selected for any orientation of the surface .",
    "the sample is mounted on a 6degrees  of  freedom manipulator , specially designed to select with great accuracy ( 0.01@xmath3 ) the orientation of the surface with respect to the incoming photon beam .",
    "the temperature of the sample , measured by thermocouples , can be varied by resistive heating and liquid nitrogen cooling .",
    "the pd(100 ) substrate was prepared by ar@xmath4 sputtering at 1  kev and annealing to 970  k. the substrate order was checked by rheed , while xps surveys at grazing incidence ( of the order of the critical angle ) were used to check for residual contamination .",
    "nickel was evaporated from a carefully outgassed electron bombardment cell ( omicron ) provided with a water cooled shield .",
    "a quartz microbalance allowed us to tune the deposition flux at a constant rate of @xmath0  0.6   / min   ( 10  % accuracy ) before deposition .",
    "the absolute calibration of the growth rate was determined a posteriori by measuring the x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) at fixed scattering angle while scanning the photon energy between 3 and 8  kev .",
    "the interference between the x - ray scattering from the substrate - film and film - vacuum interfaces gives rise to maxima and minima as a function of the perpendicular momentum transfer .",
    "fitting to the xrr curves with a simple model of regularly bulk spaced layers , thus yields the film effective thickness ( from the position of maxima and minima ) and the width of the interfaces ( from the amplitude of the oscillation ) , as shown in fig .",

    "this elastically strained structure builds up to a critical thickness of 12 - 16   , corresponding to a maximum of 10 layers ( including at least 2 intermixed layers at the substrate - film interface ) , not all of them equally occupied . beyond this thickness",

    ", a compressed vertical spacing is established , in agreement with the value predicted by the elastic theory for the given in - plane expansion , dictated by the substrate lattice .    the sequence of rod scans in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] clearly shows that there exists a maximum number of ni layers that can be stabilized into a pseudomorphic structure ( 10 layers , included the intermixed ones ) , thus defining an effective critical thickness for the structural phase transition .",
    "this configuration is established at a bulk equivalent thickness of 12   .",
    "the fact that the maximum number of layers with pseudomorphic fct structure does not change throughout the transition , but simply the fct domains decrease their homogeneity and size , indicates that the transition takes place through the lateral growth of the ni bulk - like domains at the expense of the pseudomorphic fct phase .",
    "thus the ni bulk - like domains are not floating on top of the pseudomorphic fct phase nor the transition simply proceeds from top to the bottom , rather , when formed , the ni bulk - like domains involve locally all the film layers , down to the ni / pd interface . a possible model for the ni bulk - like domains could be that of wedges , with the apex at the substrate - film interface , which expand at the expense of the pseudomorphic phase . since the phase transition involves three - dimensional domains , it must be of the first order type .",
    "no time evolution of the diffracted peaks has been observed at room temperature on the time scale of the experiments ( a few hours for the rod scans ) , which indicates that the transition is kinetically slowed down by the film defects .    at the critical thickness",
    ", the intermixing at the ni / pd interface ( almost constant up to the critical thickness ) increases strongly ( as indicated by xps analysis in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it is very tempting to associate the increase of the intermixing with the propagation of a defect from the ni / pd interface ( whose early formation might be witnessed by the incomplete layer filling of the buried ni layers at the critical thickness ) , which drives the transformation of the pseudomorphic fct phase .",
    "the ni / pd lattice mismatch of @xmath0  10  % , although not so small , might still allow the formation of an ordered pattern of misfit dislocations originated by the stacking faults at the interface , which would yield characteristic satellites of the bragg s peaks in the radial scans.@xcite while we have not checked by in - plane xrd for these feature on non - equivalent diffraction peaks other than the ( @xmath7  0  0 ) one , leed pictures taken at the critical thickness were reported to display a moir pattern with @xmath29 periodicity.@xcite these patterns clearly show one order of extra spots decorating the integer peaks along the @xmath22 substrate symmetry directions , i.e. the direction of close - compact atom rows on the fcc(100 ) surface . from comparison with the present data ( in particular with the intermixing behaviour )",
    ", we can say that the strain release indicated by the extra spots is not limited to the ni film surface , rather the moir pattern is originated by defects extending down to the substrate .",
    "the ni / pd(100 ) system , where the ni film undergoes a structural transition between two phases with the same face centered ( 100 ) surface symmetry , resembles the behavior of the fe / cu(100 ) system , where a more dramatic structural change , from an fcc(100 ) to a bcc(110 ) phase , takes place . in the latter case",
    ", the transition of the fe film was described through the formation of shear planes ( from the film surface down to the substrate ) along close - compact atom rows , which separate domains of different structural phase , like for a martensitic phase transition.@xcite    concerning the growth of the newly formed bulk - like ni domains , a mechanism like that driving the decoherence in semiconductor heteroepitaxy can be envisaged .",
    "the domain walls , either shear planes or misfit dislocations , propagate laterally on the pd substrate , leaving behind a strongly intermixed region .",
    "this picture is fully consistent with the increase of the ni / pd intermixing , which is observed to continue beyond the critical thickness ( as indicated both by xps analysis and by the ni / pd interface width obtained by the xrr analysis , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] )    finally the newly formed bulk - like ni film is still strained at small thickness ( see radial scan at 22     in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) and the relaxation to its bulk fcc structure proceeds gradually with increasing thickness . this gradual relaxation , witnessed by the radial scans of the in - plane lattice parameters , is also seen in the perpendicular layered structure of the film .",
    "in fact the simple bulk structural models used to simulate the xrr energy scans yields a fitting quality which clearly improves from the 22 to 30     film ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "such a behavior is not surprising , since it has been observed for other metal films . as an example , the bulk structure of fe deposited on cu@xmath1au(100 ) ( where the 7% lattice mismatch is even smaller than the present one ) is not fully recovered even for film thickness of the order of hundred of monolayers.@xcite",
    "we studied the growth of ni on pd(100 ) by xps ( both core levels and vb ) , xpd , xrr and xrd ( both in- and out - of - plane ) techniques .",
    "in particular , we followed the structural evolution of the ni films as a function of the thickness .",
    "after the formation of a couple of intermixed layers , ( which preserve a perpendicular spacing close to the substrate one ) a laterally pseudomorphic phase , with a perpendicular strain in agreement with the elastic theory , takes place .",
    "this pseudomorphic fct structure is stable up to 10 layers .",
    "further ni deposition leads to a gradual structural transformation of the whole film into a ni bulk - like fcc phase .",
    "this phase transition , accompanied by a strong increase of intermixing at the ni / pd interface , proceeds through the lateral growth of the ni bulk - like domains at the expense of the pseudomorphic fct phase .",

    "<S> we have measured the transformation of pseudomorphic ni films on pd(100 ) into their bulk fcc phase as a function of the film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> we made use of x - ray diffraction and x - ray induced photoemission to study the evolution of the ni film and its interface with the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of a pseudomorphic film with tetragonally strained face centered symmetry ( fct ) has been observed by out - of - plane x - ray diffraction up to a maximum thickness of 10 ni layers ( two of them intermixed with the substrate ) , where a new fcc bulk - like phase is formed . </S>",
    "<S> after the formation of the bulk - like ni domains , we observed the pseudomorphic fct domains to disappear preserving the number of layers and their spacing . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition thus proceeds via lateral growth of the bulk - like phase within the pseudomorphic one , i.e. the bulk - like fcc domains penetrate down to the substrate when formed . </S>",
    "<S> this large depth of the walls separating the domains of different phases is also indicated by the strong increase of the intermixing at the substrate - film interface , which starts at the onset of the transition and continues at even larger thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk - like fcc phase is also slightly strained ; its relaxation towards the orthomorphic lattice structure proceeds slowly with the film thickness , being not yet completed at the maximum thickness presently studied of 30     ( @xmath0  17 layers ) . </S>"
