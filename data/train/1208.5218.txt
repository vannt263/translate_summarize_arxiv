    "in quantum information processing ( qip ) , dynamical decoupling ( dd )  @xcite is a useful tool for suppressing the decoherence resulting from multiple couplings among qubits and their environments .",
    "potential applications of dynamical decoupling to quantum memory  @xcite , quantum computation ( qc )  @xcite , and fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite have been proposed recently .",
    "trains of successive pulses such as concatenated dd , uhrig dd  ( udd ) , and quadratic dd  ( qdd )  @xcite have been proposed and demonstrated successfully to eliminate unwanted couplings  @xcite without knowledge of surrounding environment , e.g. , its coupling strengths or structures .",
    "these methods are useful for experiments in which system details are largely unavailable . in practical experiments , however , theoretical approximations such as the delta pulse approximation result in the _ finite pulse width _ problem  @xcite , and the requirement of an infinite frequency bandwidth for a rectangular pulse causes deformation at the leading and trailing edges of the pulse  @xcite .",
    "both these practical resource limitations cause serious bottlenecks when using pulse dd sequences .",
    "in contrast , numerically optimized pulse sequences  @xcite make use of the complete qubit- and environment - related information .",
    "however , these methods are attractive  @xcite only when one can obtain details of a qubit - bath system , although spectroscopy and generation of pulse sequences become difficult as the system size increases . hence ,",
    "when using partial system information , we can expect better performance from dd sequences .",
    "previous studies that have used this approach include refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the spectra of the surrounding environment were reflected on their energy - constrained decoupling waveforms .    in this paper , we propose a method to numerically synthesize dd sequences under realistic resource limitations such that they can be tailored to a system based on available knowledge about qubits , environments , and instruments . in the two examples given in this paper , we generate bandwidth- and energy - constrained dd waveforms that are free from the finite pulse width problem and are robust to waveform deformation arising from instruments  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] , we describe the basic concept of our dd design . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dephase ] , we present a pragmatic example in which a single qubit is coupled to many two - level systems , and where the control field has imperfections due to instruments . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mrev ] , we apply our method to a multiqubit system where the qubits couple to each other . in sec .",
    "[ sec : resource ] , we discuss the performance of dd sequences generated under resource restrictions in terms of energy and bandwidth .",
    "the appendices describe how the average hamiltonians are calculated using floquet hamiltonian theory in the examples .",
    "let @xmath0 be the hamiltonian of a system under consideration , and @xmath1 be a time - dependent external perturbation , represented in an appropriate rotating frame .",

    "( [ eq : ave0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ave1 ] ) . given that the external perturbation @xmath1 does not always guarantee the @xmath20-periodicity of @xmath19 , the system - modulation matrix @xmath17 should be constrained such that @xmath17 are continuous at @xmath25 .    for numerical minimization",
    ", @xmath1 should be parameterized with pulse timings , flip angles , phases , and so on .",

    "the synthesis of dd sequences is then reduced to a nonlinear minimization problem : @xmath32 which can be numerically performed on a modern digital computer .",
    "this method is basically the same as that given by eq .",

    "furthermore , cost functions in lie algebra alleviate the growth of computational complexity as a system becomes larger .",
    "given that most operators in lie algebra , which stand for many - body interactions , barely appear , there is a dramatic decrease in computational costs associated with numerical optimization for a system hamiltonian that is simple and highly symmetric , i.e. , it is described with a small number of operators in lie algebra .",
    "we give a paradigmatic explanation in which a hamiltonian @xmath37 dictates a system , where @xmath38 is a @xmath39th qubit s pauli @xmath40-operator , @xmath41 are inhomogeneously broadened energy shifts , and @xmath42 is the number of qubits . in optimal control type , to obtain a dd sequence ( time - suspension sequence ) , we have to compute @xmath43 matrices , which are intractable for large @xmath42 . however , a well - known method that flips the sign of @xmath44 in the frame of @xmath1 by applying consecutive @xmath45 pulses to the qubits , such as cpmg  @xcite , refocuses the inhomogeneity .",
    "our method automates such a flipping procedure for a given system .",
