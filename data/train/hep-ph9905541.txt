    "our title clearly alludes to the story of columbus landing in what he called the  west indies \" , which later on turned out to be part of the  new world \" .",
    "i have substituted antarctica in place of the  new world \" , following a quip from frank paige after he realized that i was talking all the time about _ penguins_. at the end of the millennium , we are indeed on another discovery voyage .",
    "we are at the dawn of observing cp violation in the b system .",
    "the stage is the emerging penguins .",
    "well , had columbus seen penguins in _ his _  west indies \" , he probably would have known he was onto something really new .",
    "the em penguin ( emp ) @xmath0 ( and later , @xmath1 ) was first observed by cleo in 1993 .",
    "alas , it looked and walked pretty much according to the standard model ( sm ) , and the agreement between theory and experiment on rates are quite good .",
    "perhaps the study of cp asymmetries ( @xmath2 ) could reveal whether sm holds fully .",
    "the strong penguins ( p ) burst on the scene in 1997 , and by now the cleo collaboration has observed of order 10 exclusive modes @xcite , as well as the surprisingly large inclusive @xmath3 mode .",
    "the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 modes are rather robust , but the @xmath7 and @xmath8 rates shifted when cleo ii data were recalibrated in 1998 and part of cleo ii.v data were included .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes are still being reanalyzed .",
    "the nonobservation , so far , of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 modes are also rather stringent .",
    "the observation of the @xmath14 mode was announced in january this year , while the observation of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes were announced in march .",
    "cleo ii.v data taking ended in february . with 10 million or so each of charged and neutral b s , new results are expected by summer and certainly by winter .",
    "perhaps the first observation of direct cp violation could be reported soon .",
    "with belle and babar turning on in may , together with the cleo iii detector upgrade  all with @xmath17 separation ( pid ) capability ! ",
    "we have a three way race for detecting and eventually disentangling _ direct _ cp violation in charmless b decays .",
    "we expect that , during 19992002 , the number of observed modes may increase to a few dozen , while the events per mode may increase from 1070 to @xmath18@xmath19 events for some modes , and sensitivity for direct cp asymmetries would go from the present level of order 30% down to 10% or so .",
    "it should be realized that _",
    "the modes that are already observed _ ( @xmath20 ) _ should be the most sensitive probes . _    our first theme is therefore : _ is large @xmath2 possible in @xmath20 processes ? _ and , _",
    "if so , whither new physics ?",
    "_ however , as an antidote against the rush into the brave new world , we point out that the three observed @xmath21 modes may indicate that the ",
    "west indies \" interpretation is still correct so far .",
    "our second subject would hence be _ whither ewp ? now ! ?",
    "_ that is , we will argue for the intriguing possibility that perhaps we already have some indication for the electroweak penguin ( ewp ) .",
    "it is clear that 1999 would be an exciting landmark year in b physics .",
    "so , work hard and come party at the end of the year / century / millennium celebration called  third international conference on b physics and cp violation \" , held december 3 - 7 in taipei @xcite .",
    "we shall motivate the physics and give some results that have not been presented before , but refer to more detailed discussions that can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our interests were stirred by a _ rumor _ in 1997 that cleo had a very large @xmath2 in the @xmath6 mode .",
    "the question was : _ how to get large @xmath2 ? _ with short distance ( bander - silverman - soni @xcite ) rescattering phase from penguin , the cp asymmetry could reach its maximum of order 10% around the presently preferred @xmath22 .",
    "final state @xmath23 rescattering phases could bring this up to 30% or so , and would hence mask new physics . but",
    "a 50% asymmetry seems difficult .",
    "new physics asymmetries in the @xmath1 process @xcite and @xmath24 process @xcite are typically of order 10% , whereas asymmetries for penguin dominant @xmath20 transitions are expected to be no more than 1% .",
    "the answer to the above challenge is to _ hit sm at its weakest ! _",
    "* _ weak spot of penguin _ : dipole transition + -0.3 cm 0.8 cm 1.3 cm + note that these two terms are at same order in @xmath25 and @xmath26 expansion .",
    "the effective  charge \" is @xmath27 which vanishes when the @xmath28 or @xmath29 goes on - shell , hence , only the @xmath30 dipole enters @xmath1 and @xmath31 transitions .",
    "it is an sm quirk due to the gim mechanism that @xmath32 ( the former becoming @xmath33 coefficients in usual operator formalism for gluonic penguin ) .",
    "hence one usually does not pay attention to the subdominant @xmath34 which goes into the variously called @xmath35 , @xmath36 , or @xmath37 coefficients . in particular , @xmath31 rate in sm is only of order 0.2% .",
    "but if new physics is present , having @xmath38 is natural , hence the gluonic dipole could get greatly enhanced . while subject to @xmath1 constraint",
    ", this could have great impact on @xmath39 process . *",
    "_ blind spot of detector ! _ + because @xmath31 leads to _ jetty , high multiplicity _",
    "@xmath20 transitions + -0.3 cm 0.8 cm 0.9 cm + at present , 510% could still easily be allowed .",
    "the semileptonic branching ratio and charm counting deficits , and the strength of @xmath40 rate provide circumstantial _ hints _ that @xmath31 could be more than a few percent . * _ unconstrained new cp phase _ via @xmath41 +",
    "if enhanced by new physics , @xmath34 is likely to carry a new phase + -0.27 cm 0.8",
    "cm 0.9 cm + however , one faces a severe constraint from @xmath1 .",
    "for example it rules out the possibility of @xmath42 as source of enhancement . but",
    "as alex kagan @xcite taught me at last dpf meeting in minnesota , the constraint can be evaded if one has sources for radiating @xmath29 but not @xmath28 . *",
    "uncharted territory of nonuniversal squark masses + susy provides a natural possibility via gluino loops : + -0.35 cm 0.9 cm 1.3 cm + the simplest being a @xmath43@xmath44 mixing model @xcite .",
    "since the first generation down squark is not involved , one evades all low energy constraints .",
    "this is a new physics cp model tailor - made for @xmath20 transitions .    with the aim of generating huge cp asymmetries",
    ", we can now take @xmath45 and study @xmath46 transitions at both inclusive and exclusive level @xcite . in both",
    "we have used operator language .",
    "one needs to consider the tree diagram , which carries the cp phase @xmath47 ; the standard penguin diagrams , which contain short distance rescattering phases ; the enhanced @xmath48 dipole ( susy loop induced ) diagram ; finally , diagrams containing @xmath49 loop insertions to the gluon self - energy which are needed to maintain unitarity and consistency to order @xmath50 in rate differences @xcite .    at the inclusive level ,",
    "one finds a  @xmath31 pole \" at low @xmath51 which reflects the jetty @xmath31 process that is experimentally hard to identify .",
    "destructive interference is in general needed to allow the @xmath46 rate to be comparable to sm . but this precisely facilitates the generation of large @xmath2s !",
    "more details such as figures can be found in @xcite .",
    "dominant rate asymmetry comes from large @xmath51 of the virtual gluon . to illustrate this",
    ", table i gives inclusive br ( arbitrarily cutoff at @xmath52 gev@xmath53 ) and @xmath2 for sm and for various new cp phase @xmath54 valus , assuming @xmath31 rate of order 10% .",
    "one obtains sm - like branching ratios for @xmath55 , and @xmath2 also seem to peak . this becomes clearer in table ii where we give the results for @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( perturbative ) rescattering is fully open .",
    "we see that 2030% asymmetries are achieveable .",
    "this provides support for findings in exclusive processes .",
    "exclusive two body modes are much more problematic .",
    "starting from the operator formalism as in inclusive , we set @xmath58 , take @xmath59 and try to _ fit observed brs _ with @xmath60 .",
    "we then find the @xmath2 preferred by present rate data .",
    "one finds that , analogous to the inclusive case , destructive interference is needed and in fact provides a mechanism to suppress the pure penguin @xmath61 mode to satisfy cleo bound . for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 modes which are p - dominated",
    ", one utilizes the fact that the matrix element @xmath62 could be enhanced by low @xmath63 values ( of order 100120 mev ) to raise @xmath64 , which at same time leads to near degeneracy of @xmath6 and @xmath7 rates .",
    "the upshot is that one finds rather large cp asymmetries , i.e. @xmath65 35% , 45% and 55% for @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath13 modes , respectively , and all of the same sign .",
    "such pattern can not be generated by sm , with or without rescattering .",
    "we expect such pattern to hold true for many @xmath20 modes .",
    ".inclusive br ( in @xmath66)/@xmath2 ( in % ) for sm and for @xmath67 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have left out the prominent @xmath68 modes from our discussion largely because the anomaly contribution    -0.35 cm 0.9 cm 1.3 cm    to compute such diagrams , one needs to know the @xmath69 fock component of the @xmath70 meson !",
    "this may be at the root of the rather large size of @xmath68 mode .",
    "before we get carried away by the possibility of large cp asymmetries from new physics , there is one flaw ( or two ? ) that emerged after summer 1998 .",
    "because of p - dominance which is certainly true in case of enhanced @xmath31 , @xmath8 is only half of @xmath71 .",
    "the factor of 1/2 comes from @xmath72 , which is just an isospin clebsch factor that originates from the @xmath73 wave function .",
    "although this seemed quite reasonable from 1997 data where @xmath8 mode was not reported , a crisis emerged in summer 1998 when cleo updated their results for the three @xmath21 modes .",
    "they found @xcite @xmath74 instead !",
    "curiously , @xmath75 also , which can not change the situation . in any case the expectation that @xmath76 can not make a factor of 2 change by interference . miraculously , however , this could be the first indication of the last type of penguin , the ewp .",
    "the yet to be observed ewp ( electroweak penguin ) , namely @xmath77 , occurs by @xmath78 followed by @xmath79 .",
    "the strong penguin oftentimes obscure the @xmath46 case ( or so it is thought ) , and to cleanly identify the ewp one has to search for  pure \" ewp modes such as @xmath80 , @xmath81 which are clearly rather far away .",
    "one usually expects the @xmath82 mode to be the first ewp to be observed , which is still a year or two away , while clean and purely weak penguin @xmath83 is rather far away .    with the hint from @xmath74 , however , and",
    "putting back on our sm hat , we wish to establish the possibility that ewp may be operating behind the scene already @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that , unlike the gluon , the @xmath84 coupling depends on isospin , and can in principle break the isospin factor of 1/2 mentioned earlier .",
    "3.2 truein   3.2 truein    -.2",
    "cm    we first show that simple @xmath23 rescattering can not change drastically the factor of two . from fig .",
    "1(a ) , where we have adopted @xmath85 from current  best fit \" to ckm matrix @xcite , one clearly sees the factor of 2 between @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "we also not that rescattering , as parametrized by the phase difference @xmath86 between i = 1/2 and 3/2 amplitudes , is only between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "when we put in the ewp contribution , at first sight it seems that the effect is drastic . on closer inspection at @xmath89 ,",
    "it is clear that the ewp contribution to @xmath90 and @xmath6 modes are small , but is quite visible for @xmath8 and @xmath91 modes .",
    "this is because the @xmath8 and @xmath91 modes suffer from @xmath92 suppression in amplitude because of @xmath73 wave function .",
    "however , it is precisely these modes which pick up a sizable @xmath93 penguin contribution via the @xmath73 ( the strength of @xmath94 is roughly a quarter of @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "as one dials @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 rescattering redistributes this ewp impact and leads to the rather visible change in fig . 1(b ) .",
    "we notice the remarkable result that the ewp reduces @xmath6 rate slightly but raises the @xmath8 rate considerably , such that the two modes become rather close .",
    "we have to admit , however , to something that we have sneaked in .",
    "to enhance the relative importance of ewp , we had to suppress the strong penguin effect .",
    "we have therefore employed a much heavier @xmath97 mev as compared to 100120 mev employed previously in new physics case .",
    "otherwise we can not bring @xmath6 and @xmath8 rates close to each other .",
    "3.2 truein   3.2 truein",
    "-.2 cm    having brought @xmath6 and @xmath8 modes closer , the problem now is that @xmath7 lies above them , and the situation becomes worse for large rescattering . to remedy this , we play with the phase angle @xmath28 which tunes the weak phase of the tree contribution t. setting now @xmath89 , again we start without ewp in fig .",
    "the factor of two between @xmath6 and @xmath8 is again apparent .",
    "dialing @xmath28 clearly changes t - p interference . for @xmath28 in first quadrant one has destructive interference , which becomes constructive in second quadrant .",
    "this allows the @xmath6 mode to become larger than the pure penguin @xmath7 mode , which is insensitive to @xmath28 . however ,",
    "nowhere do we find a solution where @xmath74 is approximately true .",
    "there is always one mode that is split away from the other two .",
    "putting in ewp , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the impact is again quite visible .",
    "as anticipated , the @xmath6 and @xmath8 modes come close to each other .",
    "since their @xmath28 dependence is quite similar , one finds that for @xmath98@xmath99 , the three observed @xmath21 modes come together as close as one can get , and are basically consistent with errors allowed by data .",
    "note that @xmath8 is never larger than @xmath6 .",
    "we emphasize that a large rescattering phase @xmath86 would destroy this achieved approximate equality , as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 , where we illustrate @xmath86 dependence for @xmath100 .",
    "it seems that @xmath86 can not be larger than @xmath101 or so .",
    "3.2 truein    -.2 cm    3.2 truein   3.2 truein    -.2 cm    as a further check of effect of the ewp , we show the results for @xmath89 in fig .",
    "4 . in absence of rescattering ,",
    "the change in rate ( enhancement ) for @xmath8 mode from adding ewp is reflected in a dilution of the asymmetry , which could serve as a further test .",
    "this , however , depends rather crucially on absence of rescattering .",
    "once rescattering is included , it would be hard to distinguish the impact of ewp from cp asymmetries .",
    "however , even with rescattering phase , the @xmath28 dependence of cp asymmetries can easily distinguish between the two solutions of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "5 , where ewp effect is included . from our observation that a large @xmath86 phase would destroy the near equality of the three observed @xmath21 modes that we had obtained , we find that @xmath104 even with presence of rescattering phase @xmath86 .",
    "3.2 truein   3.2 truein    -.2",
    "cm    it should be emphasized that the @xmath28 value we find necessary to have @xmath71 is in a different quadrant than the present best ",
    "fit \" result of @xmath105@xmath106 .",
    "in particular , the sign of @xmath107 is preferred to be negative rather than positive .",
    "an extended analysis @xcite to @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 modes confirm this assertion .",
    "intriguingly , the size of @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite was anticipated via this @xmath28 value .",
    "perhaps hadronic rare b decays can provide information on @xmath28 , and present results seem to be at odds with ckm fits @xcite to @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 mixing , and in particular the @xmath114 mixing bound , which rules out @xmath115 .",

    "note that this is just an illustration .",

    "we then made an about - face and went back to sm , and pointed out that the ewp may have already shone through the special  slit \" of @xmath74 , where we inferred that @xmath98@xmath99 is preferred , which implies that @xmath115 , contrary to current ckm  fit \" preference .",
