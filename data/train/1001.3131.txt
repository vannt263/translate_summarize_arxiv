    "in the past few decades , there has been tremendous interests in the study of subluminal and superluminal light propagation @xcite .",
    "the group velocity of light pulse can be reduced in bose - einstein condensate of sodium atom gas @xcite , and in hot gases @xcite , and even halted in vapor of rb atoms @xcite .",
    "also , it can exceed the vacuum light speed , c , and can even become negative @xcite .",
    "these experiments are based on the fact that electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and electro magnetically induced absorption ( eia ) @xcite lead to a dispersion profile with a sharp positive or negative derivative @xcite .",
    "anomalous dispersion was first studied in mechanical oscillators @xcite and was later applied by sommerfeld and brillouin @xcite to light propagation in absorptive opaque materials .",
    "they showed theoretically that inside an absorption line , the dispersion can be anomalous , resulting in a group velocity faster than c , the vacuum speed of light .",
    "such an anomalous velocity appears due to the wave nature of light @xcite .",
    "talukder et al .",
    "have shown femtosecond laser pulse propagation has switched from superluminal to subluminal velocities in an absorbing dye by changing the dye concentration @xcite .",
    "shimizu et al . were able to control the light pulse speed with only a few cold atoms in a high - finesse microcavity by detuning the laser frequency from a cavity resonance frequency - locked to the atomic transition @xcite . in a series of papers @xcite , chiao and",
    "coworkers showed theoretically that anomalous dispersion can occur inside a transparent material .",
    "it was predicted that by using a gain doublet @xcite , it is possible to obtain a transparent anomalous dispersion region where the group velocity of light pulse exceeds c with almost no pulse distortion .",
    "wang et al . used gain - assisted linear anomalous dispersion in atomic cesium gas , and the group velocity of a laser pulse in their experiment exceeded c and could even become negative , while the shape of the pulse was preserved @xcite .",
    "the incoherent pumping fields can also play an important role in the controlling of the group velocity of light in dispersive media @xcite .",
    "the double-@xmath0 setup is another scheme which provides a very rich spectrum of phenomena based on atomic coherence @xcite .",
    "recently , the dispersion and the absorption properties of a weak probe field in simple multi - level quantum systems have been considered @xcite .",
    "they showed that , by using a coherent and an indirect incoherent pump field the group velocity of light can be controlled .",
    "there have been only few experimental and theoretical studies in which both free absorption superluminal and subluminal light propagation in a single system have been realized . in this article , the dispersion and the absorption properties of a weak probe field in a three - level v - type atomic system is investigated . by application of indirect incoherent pump fields",
    "the effect of populating upper levels on optical properties of the atomic medium in presence of a strong coherent pump field is investigated .",
