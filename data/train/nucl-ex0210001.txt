    "identified charged hadrons in 11 different centrality selections @xcite and the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) dependence of hbt radii in 9 @xmath7 bins @xcite are measured in au - au collisions at 200 gev by the phenix experiment @xcite . in both the 200 gev and",
    "previously measured 130 gev data @xcite , the @xmath9 of all particles increases from the most peripheral to the most central events and with heavier particle mass ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath9 on @xmath10 suggests a radial expansion , and its dependence on the number of participant nucleons ( @xmath11 ) may be due to an increasing radial expansion from peripheral to central events .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of the hbt radii was also observed and interpreted as a radial expansion .",
    "both the spectra and the @xmath7 dependence of the hbt radii are fit using parameterizations based on a simple model for the source , where fluid elements are each in local thermal equilibrium and move in space - time with a hydrodynamic expansion @xcite .",
    "the assumptions are : @xmath12 no temperature gradients , @xmath13 longitudinal boost invariance along the collision axis z , @xmath14 infinite extent in space - time rapidity @xmath15 , and @xmath16 cylindrical symmetry with radius r. the particles are emitted along a hyperbola of constant proper time @xmath17 and short emission duration , @xmath18 1 fm / c .",
    "the @xmath19 dependence of the yield @xmath20 is calculated after integrating the source over space - time ( azimuthal and rapidity coordinates ) @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that all particles decouple kinematically on the freeze - out hypersurface at the same freeze - out temperature @xmath5 , and that the particles collectively expand with a velocity profile @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the geometric radius , @xmath23 is the transverse coordinate , and @xmath24 is the surface velocity .",
    "( for a box profile , the average velocity is @xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite ) .",
    "the particle density distribution is assumed to be independent of the radial position in the fits to the single particle spectra . in the previous 130 gev analysis @xcite , a gaussian density profile increases",
    "@xmath24 by @xmath27 2% with a negligible difference in @xmath5 , while a parabolic velocity profile increases @xmath24 by 13% and @xmath5 by 5% .",
    "we use analytic expressions to calculate the hbt radii @xcite . a linear flow rapidity profile in the transverse plane",
    "is assumed and a gaussian distribution is used for the particle density dependence on r. the parameters are the geometric radius r , the freeze - out temperature t , the flow rapidity at the surface @xmath28 ( @xmath24 @xmath29 ) and the freeze - out proper time @xmath30 .",
    "in order to minimize contributions from hard processes , all @xmath19 dependent particle yields are fit in the range @xmath1 gev . as resonance decays are known to produce pions at low @xmath0 @xcite , we place a lower @xmath0 threshold of 500 mev / c on @xmath31 in the fit .",
    "a similar approach was followed by na44 , e814 , and other experiments at lower energies . in fig .",

    "the uncertainty is @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 mev respectively .",
    "added in quadrature , the total systematic uncertainty in the inverse slope is @xmath38 mev .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in @xmath24 is dominated by the uncertainty in the @xmath4 spectral shape at low @xmath0 and is determined by measuring the change in @xmath24 after fitting for @xmath39 gev / c .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in @xmath24 is @xmath40 .    for the 5% most central events , particles",
    "are coupled to an expanding system with a surface velocity of @xmath41 and decouple at a common temperature of @xmath42 mev with negligible statistical errors . for the most peripheral events , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "a simultaneous fit to the hbt data could not be found over a broad range of parameter space . as an example",
    ", if the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath5 are set to the values from the spectra analysis , then the fit to the hbt results constrains r and @xmath53 from the @xmath50 and @xmath52 data respectively , yet the model overpredicts @xmath54 by more than 3@xmath55 for all but the first @xmath19 data point ( fig .

    "the @xmath8 contour levels of the expansion parameters @xmath58 ( vertical ) and @xmath59 ( horizontal ) are shown for simultaneous fits to the spectra and separate fits to each hbt radius in fig .",
    "we note that no @xmath8 minima are found , hence the contours are not closed . for the spectra ,",
    "the contours are closed and show an anticorrelation , however there is no overlap with the hbt contours .",
    "the hbt radius @xmath50 prefers large flow rapidity @xmath60 and low temperatures @xmath61 mev .",
    "the parameterization has the most difficulty reproducing @xmath51 .",
    "the single particle spectra are qualitatively described by a hydrodynamic parameterization that assumes boost invariance and a linear transverse flow profile .",
    "the transverse expansion in 11 different centrality classes is extracted from the single particle spectra . within the systematic uncertainties , the expansion parameters @xmath58 and @xmath62 , respectively decrease and increase with the number of participants , saturating at mid - centrality .",
    "expressions for the hbt radii based on similar hydrodynamic assumptions and gaussian density profiles do not describe the identical @xmath31 pair data .",
