    "it has long been known that the properties of galaxies depend on the environment in which they are located .",
    "elliptical , non - star - forming galaxies occupy more dense regions of space than star - forming , disc - dominated galaxies , giving rise to the so - called morphology - density relation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the physical origin of this relation is still subject to debate , with disagreement mainly centering on whether the relation arises due to internal or external processes ( nature vs nurture ) .    most recent low redshift studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) utilise the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) or the two - degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) to conduct statistical investigations of galaxy environments .",
    "@xcite constrained the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) using the 4000  break and found that the ssfr ( and nuclear activity ) depend most strongly on local density , from star - forming galaxies at low densities to predominantly inactive systems at high densities .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite found that structure , colour and morphology are mainly dependent on galaxy mass but that at fixed mass , colour and , to a lesser extent , morphology are sensitive to environment .",
    "studies of h@xmath7 @xcite found that it s strength does not depend on environment but that the fraction of galaxies with equivalent width , @xmath84  is environmentally dependant , decreasing with increasing density .",
    "they also noted that emission line fraction appears to depend on both the local environment ( @xmath0 1mpc ) and on the large scale structure ( @xmath0 5mpc ) .",
    "studies at higher redshifts ( z @xmath0 1 ) have used surveys such as deep2 @xcite and vvds @xcite .",
    "deep2 investigations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) used the projected third nearest neighbour statistic , studying galaxy properties and the colour - density relation respectively .",
    "they concluded that there is a strong dependence on rest frame @xmath2 colour , with blue galaxies occupying lower density regions but showing a strong increase in mean local density with luminosity at @xmath9 .",
    "this they conclude is consistent with the rapid quenching of star formation by agn or supernova feedback , as ram pressure stripping , harassment and tidal interactions , which occur preferentially in clusters , would be insufficient to explain these findings .",
    "@xcite also observed that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence increases with local density , as in the local universe , but this weakens with redshift and disappears by @xmath10 .",
    "the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds ) investigated the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxy colour - density relation up to z@xmath01.5 @xcite . in agreement with @xcite",
    "they found that the local colour - density relation progressively weakens and possibly reverses in the highest redshift bin ( 1.2@xmath11z@xmath111.5 ) .",
    "this may imply that quenching of star formation was more efficient in high density regions .",
    "the vvds team also observed that the colour - density relations depend on luminosity and found that at fixed luminosity there is a decrease in the number of red objects as a function of redshift in high density regions .",
    "this implied that star formation ends at earlier cosmic epochs for more luminous / massive galaxies , which is consistent with downsizing @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the vvds survey is based on optical @xmath12-band selection , and as such will be strongly biased against red , passive galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "conclusions from deep k - selected samples suggest that the galaxy colour bimodality is present to at least z@xmath01.5 ( e.g. @xcite ) and may be still be present at z@xmath02 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . furthermore",
    "red galaxies have been seen to strongly cluster at z@xmath131.5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) which suggests that a colour - density relation may also exist at these higher redshifts .",
    "a number of physical processes may be responsible for the observed environmental trends .",
    "mergers or tidal interactions can tear galactic discs apart and are likely to play an important role in forming the most massive galaxies observed today ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other processes such as gas stripping can severely reduce the star formation rate by removing the cold gas from galaxies falling into massive dark - matter halos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "feedback is also thought to play a major role , either from agn or supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these processes may heat or eject the gas within galaxies and thus effectively terminate any further star formation , which can rapidly lead to the build - up of the galaxy red sequence .",
    "finally infalling cold gas in low mass dark matter halos may fall directly onto the galaxy , whereas in high mass halos the gas is thought to be heated by shocks and therefore remains supported ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a key goal of observational extragalactic astronomy is to disentangle which of these processes are responsible for establishing the bimodal galaxy populations observed in the local universe .    with the recent advent of deep , wide - field infrared imaging in the ukidss uds we can now extend studies of galaxy environments to z@xmath131 .",
    "selection in the infrared avoids the major biases against dusty and/or evolved stellar populations , allowing us to investigate whether correlations observed at low redshift also occur at high redshift and how these change over time .",
    "the large contiguous area of this survey also allows us to probe a wide range of environments using large samples of galaxies .",
    "the paper is structured as follows :  2 outlines the data and selection criteria used in this work . ",
    "3 discusses the method used to estimate galaxy environments .",
    "the results are then presented in  4 and  5 , with  6 summarising our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15=0.3 , @xmath16=0.7 and @xmath17=71 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "this work has been performed using the third data release ( dr3 ) of the ukirt ( united kingdom infra - red telescope ) infrared deep sky survey , ultra - deep survey ( ukidss , uds ; @xcite ; almaini et al in prep ) .",
    "the ukidss project consists of 5 sub - surveys of which the uds is the deepest , with a target depth of k=25 ( ab ) over a single 4-pointing mosaic of the wide - field camera ( wfcam , @xcite ) , giving the uds an area of 0.88 x 0.88 degrees . the 5@xmath19 , ab depths within 2@xmath20 apertures for the j , h and k - bands are 23.7 , 23.5 and 23.7 respectively for the dr3 , making it the deepest near infrared survey over such a large area at the time of release .",

    "( in prep . ) and @xcite .",
    "the field is also covered by deep optical data in the b , v , r , i@xmath21 and z@xmath21 -bands with depths of @xmath22=28.4 , @xmath23=27.8 , @xmath24=27.7 , @xmath25=27.7 and @xmath26=26.7 from the subaru - xmm deep survey ( sxds ) ( * ? ? ?",

    "( 2010 ) . ]    the galaxy sample used here is primarily based on selection in the k - band image , upon which we impose a cut at @xmath33=23 to minimise photometric errors and spurious sources and also to ensure a high level of completeness ( @xmath34100 per cent ) and reliable photometric redshifts ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bright stars are trivially removed from the combined catalogue by excluding objects on a stellar locus defined by 2-arcsec and 3-arcsec apertures , which is effective to @xmath35 .",
    "the fainter stars are removed using a @xmath36 diagram @xcite and the criterion @xmath37 .",
    "these cuts and careful masking of bright saturated stars and surrounding contaminated regions leave 33,765 galaxies in our sample .",
    "the magnitudes from the dr3 catalogue were used to determine photometric redshifts and stellar ages by @xmath38 minimisation using a large set of templates .",
    "this was performed with a code based largely on the hyperz package @xcite using both average local galaxy seds and templates from the k20 survey .",
    "six seds of observed starbursts from @xcite were also used to improve the characterisation of young blue galaxies . this yeilded photometric redshifts with a @xmath39z/(1+z)=0.008 with a standard deviation of @xmath19=0.034 after the exclusion of outliers ( for more detail see @xcite ; @xcite and references within ) .",
    "this also provided rest frame magnitudes and colours , of which the rest frame @xmath2 and @xmath40-band absolute magnitude are utilised here .",
    "sources with an unacceptable fit ( @xmath41 ) are removed from our sample as these are likely to be unreliable .",
    "this removes 4@xmath42 of the galaxy sample , the majority of these are either qsos ( 36% ) , cross - talk ( 26% ) or the minor members of pairs or mergers ( 23% ) , with the remainder consisting largely of objects with very low surface brightness .",
    "the fraction of otherwise useful objects rejected is therefore @xmath110.6@xmath42 .      to define a passive galaxy subset with minimal contamination from dusty star forming objects we use a subset of galaxies outlined in @xcite .",
    "templates were used to fit either an instantaneous burst parameterised by an age , or an exponentially decaying star - formation rate parameterised by an age and @xmath43 , the e - folding time in the exponentially declining star - formation rate , such that , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the star - formation rate at the time of observation and @xmath46 was the initial value .",
    "we define a conservative passive sample as galaxies that are simultaneously old ( age@xmath131gyr ) and have ongoing star formation with @xmath47 of @xmath48 , and a star forming sample with @xmath49 of @xmath48 , with 3947 and 22,158 galaxies in each sample respectively .",
    "to define the red sequence we performed a @xmath38 minimisation to fit an equation of the form @xmath50   to the old , burst galaxies , defining the red sample to be all galaxies within 3@xmath19 of this fit ( see @xcite for a more detailed description ) . in this work , to separate red and blue galaxies , we use the red - sequence slope from @xcite but choose the division between the two populations to fit the minimum in the overall colour bimodality ( as shown in the histogram in figure [ ubmk ] ) .",
    "this leads to a dividing line in the colour - magnitude diagram as follows : @xmath51 this boundary was found to separate the red and blue populations effectively to z@xmath01.75 . at higher redshift the bimodality in galaxy colours",
    "is less clear , which may in part be due to photometric errors .",
    "a full examination of this issue and the evolution of the red sequence will be presented in cirasuolo et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "previous studies have found evidence for an evolution in the location of the red sequence with redshift ( e.g @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    "we choose not to model the red sequence in such detail and instead use the fixed colour selection boundary given above .",
    "we note , however , that using an evolving boundary made no significant difference to any of the conclusions presented in this work .",
    "table [ ngal ] shows the resulting number of red and blue galaxies assigned to each photometric redshift bin , including the conservative subsamples of passive and actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "we used two methods to calculate galaxy environment : counts in an aperture and @xmath52th nearest neighbour . in both methods all the galaxies within a photometric redshift bin",
    "are collapsed down onto a 2d plane and the redshift information within the bin is not utilised any further . in the aperture method apertures of 1mpc , 500kpc and",
    "250kpc diameter ( physical ) are placed on each galaxy and the number of galaxies within that aperture are counted ( n@xmath53 ) . a sample of @xmath0100,000 random galaxies",
    "are then put down in the unmasked regions and the number of randoms within the aperture are counted ( n@xmath54 ) .",
    "the number of galaxies within the aperture is then normalised to give the final density measurement , @xmath55 : @xmath56 where n@xmath57 and n@xmath58 are then total number of random points and galaxies respectively , so that @xmath55=1 corresponds to a density consistent with that of a random distribution of galaxies .",
    "this method was chosen to be the basis of this work as it is conceptually simple , and as concluded by @xcite , this technique has a distinct advantage in fields masked by a large number of holes .",
    "the nearest neighbour method would require the exclusion of a large fraction of data close to holes and field edges .",
    "the @xmath52th nearest neighbour method was first employed by @xcite , this calculates the distance to the @xmath52th nearest galaxy , @xmath59 in mpc and is expressed here as a surface density , @xmath60 the surface density , @xmath61 is then renormalised such that , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the median density of galaxies within the field . to reduce the effect of the edges , the distance to the nearest edge",
    "was calculated and if this was less than the distance to the third nearest neighbour then the object was removed from the sample .",
    "this method was only used in this work to test the primary findings of the aperture method .",
    "the results are presented in the appendix .",
    "below we explore the relationship between galaxy colours and environment as a function of redshift .",
    "relatively broad redshift bins are used to minimise the contamination due to photometric redshift errors .",
    "these sources of uncertainty are explored further in section 5 .",
    "values are obtained by performing a ks test , representing the significance in rejecting the null - hypothesis that the samples are drawn from the same underlying population . ]        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      figure [ rbhist ] shows histograms of galaxy environments within two apertures of 1mpc and 500kpc diameter .",
    "these are divided into four redshift bins between @xmath64 and @xmath65 and into red and blue populations .",
    "a ks - test was performed on the samples to assess the difference between the red and blue populations , with all but the final redshift bin showing highly significant differences between the two populations . in the first three redshift bins we can exclude the null hypothesis that the red and blue galaxies are drawn from the same underlying population with a significance in excess of 5@xmath19 significance , falling to @xmath112@xmath19 and @xmath111@xmath19 significance at @xmath66 .",
    "figure [ rbpass ] is a plot of the mean density of red , blue , passive ( black ) and star forming ( cyan ) galaxies in bins of absolute k - band magnitude .",
    "error bars are derived from the error on the mean density of galaxies within a given bin .",
    "sources of error are explored further in section 5 .",
    "the passive and star forming galaxies are defined in section 2 . as before they are plotted in four redshift bins but with an additional 250kpc aperture .",
    "this plot illustrates that red and/or passive galaxies reside in significantly denser environments than blue and/or star - forming galaxies from the present day to @xmath67 , and this difference is apparent at all luminosities .",
    "this is comparable to what has been found in the local universe by other studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    figure [ rbpass ] also shows that passive galaxies ( shown in black ) follow a similar density profile to red galaxies but are on average in slightly denser environments .",
    "this supports the conclusion that passive galaxies within the red population are responsible for the enhanced environments compared to blue star - forming objects .",
    "the environments of galaxies that were red but not in the strict ` passive ' sample were also investigated and these were found to lie in - between the red and blue galaxy environments , as would be expected ( these are not shown for clarity ) .",
    "the actively star - forming galaxies exhibit the same environmental dependence as the blue galaxies , following the same luminosity - density profile .",
    "in addition to the clear separation of red and blue galaxies , we also find a general trend of increasing galaxy density with luminosity , particularly for blue galaxies and on smaller scales .",
    "inspecting the two intermediate redshift bins in figure [ rbpass ] , on scales below @xmath68kpc we find that the most luminous blue galaxies appear to inhabit environments approaching those of red / passive galaxies .",
    "these results are consistent with the findings of @xcite , who observed a strong increase in local density with luminosity for blue galaxies at @xmath9 .",
    "our results appear to extend these findings to higher redshift , suggesting that the epoch @xmath69 represents a key period of transformation of massive galaxies from the blue cloud onto the passive red sequence .      in figure [ colour ]",
    "we display average density as a function of @xmath2 rest - frame colour , with faint ( -22.5@xmath70 - 21.5 ) and luminous ( -24@xmath70 - 22.5 ) objects shown in green and black respectively .",
    "this shows a clear trend for galaxies below z@xmath02 , with redder galaxies occupying denser average environments . in the lowest redshift bin",
    "this change occurs very abruptly at the boundary in the colour bimodality at @xmath710.7 ( see figure [ ubmk ] ) .",
    "there is also a general trend for more luminous galaxies to occupy denser environments .",
    "z@xmath111.75 is shown in the bottom right with the error bars calculated from the error on the mean of the four quadrants , to give an estimate of the cosmic variance . ]    in summary , we have found strong evidence that red galaxies are on average found in denser local environments than blue galaxies , extending the comparison to a higher redshift than any previous study .",
    "@xcite probed up to @xmath10 , finding that red and blue galaxies at this redshift occupy indistinguishable environments .",
    "in contrast we find that there is a significant difference between red and blue galaxies between @xmath72 ( see figures [ rbhist ] and [ rbpass ] ) .",
    "this difference is likely to be due to our method of selecting galaxies from deep infrared imaging .",
    "very red , passive galaxies will have been missed from the r - band selected candidates used in the deep2 study .",
    "this selection effect can be quantified using our uds sample .",
    "considering only the most luminous galaxies ( m@xmath73@xmath74 - 22.5 ) in the redshift range 1@xmath11z@xmath111.3 , if we impose the selection criteria of deep2 ( r@xmath75@xmath7424.1 ) we find that 75% of red galaxies would be missed compared to only 20% of the blue sample . at fainter luminosities virtually no red / passive galaxies are selected .",
    "in this section we conduct a number of tests to investigate various source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "we attempt to quantify the cosmic variance in our data by dividing the survey into four quadrants .",
    "a volume limited study of the brighter galaxies is also performed , to allow a clearer comparison between different redshift bins .",
    "finally we investigate the effects of photometric redshift errors using monte carlo simulations .      to attempt to quantify the effects of cosmic variance on our results we divide the uds field into four quadrants .",
    "the median values of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 positions of the galaxies were used to divide the field , to ensure that the number of galaxies in each quadrant was comparable .",
    "the results for the galaxies in the redshift range 1.25@xmath11z@xmath111.75 are shown in figure [ cosvarz3 ] .",
    "the average density versus k - band absolute magnitude is shown for the four quadrants , with the bottom left panel showing the projected distribution in the field .",
    "the lower right panel shows the original result from figure 3 ( red and blue only ) but with the error bars calculated from the error on the mean of the densities in the four quadrants in each magnitude bin .",
    "it can be seen that the distinction between red and blue galaxy environments remains , although there are clearly significant variations across the field .",
    "we conclude that while field variance is clearly present in these data the primary findings remain robust .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn from other redshift bins and on other scales , which are not shown in the interests of brevity .    as a cautionary remark , however , we note that strictly speaking we have only tested the _ internal _ field variance , since despite the relatively wide field of the uds ( @xmath78 comoving mpc at @xmath9 ) we may nevertheless be prone to large - scale cosmic variance due to unusual superstructures ( somerville et al . 2004 ) . testing against such effects will require further wide - area infrared surveys , such as the forthcoming video and ultra - vista surveys .",
    "our measurement of environmental density is based on a flux limited survey , so by definition we are using fainter galaxies to define environments at low redshift . to investigate the influence of this systematic effect we reduced the sample to only the brightest galaxies with @xmath79 - 22 ( ab ) and repeated the environmental analysis using this volume - limited sample .",
    "this allows the galaxies to be used as tracers in the measure of environment over the same range in luminosity at all redshifts , to allow a fairer comparison between epochs .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ rb24 ] , where the average density versus k - band luminosity is shown for comparison with the flux - limited study in figure [ rbpass ] . as expected , the volume - limited study is much noisier ( particularly at low redshift ) but the results are consistent with the primary findings of section 4 .",

    "such errors would generally dilute differences in galaxy environments , but could potentially introduce fake overdensities if a large fraction of low - redshift structure is incorrectly assigned to a higher redshift bin .",
    "we note , of course , that the effects of photo - z errors are already present in the data , so these simulations can only provide an indication of the magnitude of the shifts due to these effects .",
    "the distribution of spectroscopic versus photometric redshifts used in this field are shown in figure [ zvsz ] , with spectroscopic redshifts derived from a variety of sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; akiyama et al .",

    "we use the distribution in each redshift bin ( higher redshift bins indicated in figure [ zvsz ] ) to estimate the fraction of galaxies incorrectly reassigned from one redshift bin to another . for simplicity",
    "two categories were adopted : ` catastrophic ' errors were defined as those with @xmath80 , while others are classified as ` normal ' . in the absence of catastrophic errors",

    "these simulations were motivated by the worry that incorrect redshifts may inevitably lead to errors in the resulting restframe @xmath2 colours .",
    "we adopt an extreme approach by simulating 100% misclassification , using the contaminating fractions outlined above but moving only blue galaxies into the red sample and vice versa .",

    "<S> we find that galaxy colour is strongly correlated with galaxy overdensity on small scales ( @xmath3  mpc diameter ) , with red / passive galaxies residing in significantly denser environments than blue / star - forming galaxies to @xmath4 . on smaller scales ( @xmath5  mpc diameter ) </S>",
    "<S> we also find a relationship between galaxy luminosity and environment , with the most luminous blue galaxies at @xmath6 inhabiting environments comparable to red , passive systems at the same redshift . </S>",
