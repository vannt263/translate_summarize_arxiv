    "the origin of the solar system and the formation of solar type stars are we d through contemporary studies of primitive solar nebula from a wide range of perspectives including observational and theoretical astrophysics , nucleosynthesis , planetary dynamics , accretion physics and meteoritics @xcite .",
    "the general scenario @xcite includes a sequence of stages : ( a ) the initial collapse of interstellar gas nucleating the central protostar ( @xmath5 0.1 myr ) ( b ) slow mass accretion onto the star and primary planetesimal formation around the evolving accretion disk ( @xmath5 myr ) followed by ( c ) a phase ( @xmath5 myr ) during which the accretion rate drops significantly allowing the photoevaporative wind to `` sever '' the disk into two portions at a radius that depends on the ratio of the stellar accretion rate to the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation , and finally ( d ) a rapid _ clearing phase _ ( @xmath5 0.1 myr )",
    "during which the inner disk is accreted onto the central star and the lightest elements of outer disk are removed by direct exposure to photoevaporative uv flux .",
    "radiometric dating reveals that ca - al - rich inclusions ( cais ) within carbonaceous chondrite meteorites are about 4.57 gy old , thereby constituting the first planetary materials ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several my later , well after protoplanetesimals had already been processed , chondrules within chondrites were still forming @xcite .",
    "whereas very small particles move ostensibly as does the slightly sub - keplerian nebular gas , planet sized objects couple very weakly to the gas .",
    "therefore , the build up of protoplanets reaches an impasse at the meter scale due to the exchange of angular momentum with the gas ; this relative motion is responsible for a drag that causes them to drift inward and they are lost to the central star on time scales much less than the cai to chondrule interval @xcite .",
    "the competition between gravitational settling and turbulence can lead to a disk midplane enhanced by solid matter and thus the same basic impasse is operative due to solid - solid angular momentum exchange which dominates the net drag effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "therefore , an outstanding problem in cosmogony is to understand how , when objects can agglomerate to the critical @xmath5 meter scale by known _",
    "low _ collisional velocity accretion processes @xcite , they are not then rapidly lost into the central star ?",
    "hence , it is sought to reveal the basic mechanisms through which matter can accrete sufficiently rapidly to slow their radial motion and thwart their demise .",
    "two general approaches are advanced ; one focuses on building planetesimals from grain - grain accretion and the other proposes gravitational collapse of the disk  treated as either a one or two - component ( solid and gas ) `` fluid''on length scales much larger than grain scale processes .",
    "the latter , safronov - goldreich - ward @xcite and related @xcite theories , overcome the bottleneck without the need to treat the microphysics of particle agglomeration , by studying the gravitational collapse of the one ( solid or gas ) or two - component ( solid and gas ) disk .",
    "the idea is that when the solids dominate , as matter settles to the midplane the density exceeds a critical value and self gravity induces an instability with a characteristic length scale that produces planetesimals either sufficiently large to settle into stable keplerian orbits or of sufficient abundance to drive further gravitational accretion eventually leading to the same large planetesimal state .",
    "when gases dominate , collapse is predicted to form giant gaseous protoplanetesimal cores that drive further accretion of gas @xcite .",
    "gravitational collapse by the settling of solids to the midplane is criticized @xcite on the basis that it ignores the effects of gas pressure that drive turbulent shear and maintain the disk density below the critical value . however , the nature of disk turbulence is invoked both to assist and suppress various types of aggregation . for example",
    "@xcite argue that the turbulence driven `` streaming instability '' , associated with the relative motion between solids and gas , can localize solids in the midplane and facilitate agglomeration whereas @xcite argue that in `` stokes trapping '' turbulence suppresses the aggregation of solids .",
    "agglomeration through surface effects , studied in many experiments and simulations @xcite , posits that above a certain threshold collisional velocity , @xmath1 0.1 - 10 cm s@xmath2 , particle agglomeration is not possible ; elastic rebound overcomes attractive intermolecular forces . additionally , the experimental agglomerates are generally of high porosity and their fragility is often cited as a central difficulty with such an approach to planetary accretion @xcite . while , for example , van der waals interactions can accrete highly porous bodies @xcite , both the long nebular time scales and temperature variations will facilitate densification , and thus increased strength , through the _ sintering _ and _ annealing _ of polycrystalline matter  well known processes in condensed matter physics that has power law scaling in time @xcite . annealing and sintering are apparently not commonly discussed in regards to the issue of porosity in laboratory experiments of accretion . therefore , a basic understanding of surface and interfacial physics and the processes of cohesion and inelasticity is required to assess accretion scenarios and the range of validity of perfect sticking @xcite .      outside the framework of the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmn ) , it is a challenging exercise to calculate the relevant phase fronts in an evolving accretion disk @xcite . for example , depending on , _",
    "inter alia _ , turbulent mixing , the gas density , the nebular optical depth and the epoch of evolution",
    ", the snowline can vary many au with a temperature @xmath5 170 @xmath7 20 @xmath8 , moving inward as the disk evolves .",
    "thus , separate from the feasibility of computing it , knowledge of the entire thermodynamic history of a particle undergoing a two - body collision is highly model dependent .",
    "however , it is important to put the situation discussed here in thermodynamic context for particle collisions . for a given material the basic kinetics of growth at a fixed temperature in a nebula can strongly influence its bulk and surface properties and hence collisional physics . based solely on equilibrium considerations , ice alone",
    "exercises an enormous area of its phase diagram in a disk .",
    "regardless of the material , it is well known that a host of basic equilibrium and disequilibrium phenomena will influence the bulk and interfacial properties @xcite .",
    "therefore , depending on the detailed history of a particle it may , over the long times associated with disk evolution , have annealed to obtain normal compact laboratory properties @xcite , or it may have a highly porous structure @xcite . these issues are discussed in section [ sec : liquidity ] , but we note that , in the absence of fracture , the mechanism described here provides a wide range of high sticking probability collisions for a very broad range of particle densities and thermodynamic conditions .",
    "hence , this new mechanism acts in concert with other mechanisms of particle destruction and sticking @xcite .      in this paper a new thermodynamic mechanism of mass agglomeration , termed _ collisional fusion _",
    "is described .",
    "the mechanism involves the confluence of collisional energetics , intermolecular interactions and structural surface and bulk phase transitions .",
    "while the stresses in solid / solid collisions have been embodied in a range of planetesimal studies through examination of , among other things , the restitution coefficient @xcite , their influence on the bulk and _ interfacial phase behavior _ has heretofore received little attention . due to a combination of accessibility and the dual role of relevance to both the formation of the gas giants and the dynamics of saturn s rings ,",
    "there have been a number of experiments on the collisions of ice particles under various conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but none at the very high pressures and low temperatures where this new mechanism is operative . depending on the temperature and pressure , many materials can take on multiple equilibrium crystal structures ( _ polymorphs _ ) and moreover , under other conditions the crystalline order of one of the polymorphs can be lost and the system becomes _ amorphous _ such as is the case with glass .",
    "water substance exhibits a rich polymorphism and amorphism in its phase behavior . here",
    ", classical collision physics is modified by an extension of the idea of _ damage assisted interfacial melting _",
    "@xcite to the very high pressures that drive the fusion of matter by momentary liquifaction / amorph - polymorphization and freezing / annealing .",
    "the theory is quantitatively borne out in solid ice ( ih and ic ) down to @xmath9 150 @xmath8 , low density amorphous ice ( lda ) and high density amorphous ice ( hda ) at lower temperatures .",
    "moreover , the process occurs in silicon , which melts at @xmath5 1690 @xmath8 , and where the range of collisional fusion speeds is @xmath3 100 - 1000 m s@xmath2 , as seen in the recent molecular dynamics simulations of @xcite .",
    "finally , bodies of inhomogenous composition can fuse in this manner .",
    "for example , a body with an icy mantle of sufficient thickness can fuse with another or other multicomponent materials , such as olivine , with similar melting temperatures can act in the same manner so long as one has access to the relevant phase diagrams .",
    "hence the approach provides a framework for collisions from the inner to the outer nebula . for clarity and brevity",
    "the focus here is on the latter , where it is found that perfect sticking is extended to a range of collisional speeds @xmath3 1 - 100 m s@xmath2 which encompass both typical turbulent rms speeds and the velocity differences between boulder sized and small grains @xmath5 1 - 50 m s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the development of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : summ ]",
    "the basic physical processes at play and an outline of the logic structure of the mechanism of collisional fusion is summarized .",
    "the detailed treatment of the thermodynamic state theory of collisional fusion is described in [ sec : thermo ] after which , in [ sec : drift ] the ideas are used to address the bottleneck problem by calculating the fate of drifters beginning from several places in nebulae experiencing a wide range of turbulent enhancement / suppression of midplane solids .",
    "a guide to the variables and symbols used is provided in table [ table : variables ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "aggregation of snow on the ground or dustballs on a floor is facilitated by weak interparticle collisional speeds and attractive intermolecular forces such as van der waals interactions .",
    "if the temperature does not rise above freezing snow crystals will fuse together ( _ sinter _ ) and then densify through annealing / coarsening driven by the tendency to reduce surface energy .",
    "such processes are driven by either surface or volume diffusion or the transport of mobile surface films @xcite and they underlie the fact snow drifts soon form a crust on their surfaces or that one can form a solid metal object beginning with a powder @xcite . hence , the agglomeration and densification of matter is facilitated by time and very low collisional speeds where weak attractive interactions dominate . however , when we toss an ice cube against the wall it will bounce , falling to the floor and often shattering . throwing it at a higher velocity results in shattering upon collision with the wall .",
    "the theory developed quantitatively here considers the situation in which the wall is made of ice , and an ice ball is thrown at it some 10 s of ms@xmath2 . upon contact , the interfacial pressure rises dramatically and some of the collisional energy momentary liquifies or disorders a thin region shared by the two surfaces . in a nebula",
    "the ambient temperatures are sufficiently low relative to the melting points of materials under consideration that any liquid ( or disordered material ) will rapidly freeze ( or anneal ) thereby fusing the particles so long as their stored elasticity is not so rebound occurs first .",
    "thus , there is a low speed fusion and annealing of molecules and small particles , a higher speed bouncing and then an even higher speed  reentrant  fusion .",
    "this basic process is not specific to ice , but ice is particularly relevant to nebulae and holds common terrestrial experience .",
    "the process of high speed collisional fusion simply depends on the phase diagram of the material and the place ( and hence thermodynamic conditions ) in a nebula where a collision occurs .",
    "it can operate , _ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", in the inner or outer nebular regions and in all manner of materials .",
    "the bottleneck problem is addressed by analyzing a meter sized midplane object rapidly spiraling into the central star and colliding with a range of smaller particles down to a fraction of a centimeter .",
    "the growth rate of the inspiraling object is calculated using the theory of collisional fusion and a disk model that includes a parameterization of turbulence to estimate the midplane particle density .",
    "it is found that the inspiraling object grows sufficiently rapidly by this mechanism to settle into a stable keplerian orbit .",
    "this basic mechanism is not specific to ice , but to make concrete predictions the theory is demonstrated with calculations that focus on ice in two nebular regions beyond the snowline .",
    "the logic sequence is as follows .",
    "( i ) upon collision the interfacial pressure rises dramatically .",
    "the associated shift in the melting transition , or structural phase transition to an amorph / polymorph is determined from the phase diagram of @xcite shown in figure [ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "( ii ) the fraction of the collisional energy / area inducing damage and hence the associated interfacial liquidity / disorder is determined from equation [ eq : film ] and shown in figure [ fig : d(v ) ] .",
    "( iii ) the laboratory experiments of @xcite are used to constrain the degree of interfacial damage , @xmath10 , as shown in figure [ fig : v(crit ) ] below .",
    "these are extended to the astrophysical regime by harnessing the low temperature high pressure phase behavior determined from the laboratory experiments of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( iv ) if the time to refreeze ( anneal ) the liquid ( amorph / polymorph ) so produced is of order or less than the collision time then the particles fuse together .",
    "there is a critical velocity beyond which the collision time is too rapid and fusion fails .",
    "thus , agglomeration is reentrant with collision speed @xmath0 .",
    "fusion occurs when @xmath11 @xmath12 and for ice a new high speed window of perfect sticking is found ; @xmath13 1 - 100 m s@xmath2 .",
    "this range is extended to larger @xmath0 for higher melting temperature materials .",
    "therefore , the degree of damage induced disorder , and the temperature and particle size dependent collision versus freezing times , combine to determine the new collisional fusion window @xmath14 shown in figure [ fig : v(range ) ] .",
    "the ubiquity of gravitational and intermolecular forces is responsible for their different , but omnipresent , influence on all macroscopic bodies .",
    "they are both power law forces and they both influence the structure and properties of materials",
    ". however , due to their vastly different strengths and ranges of interaction they influence matter on disparate length scales . while we have a more visceral intuition for the fact that the gravitational field layers the structure of planetary and stellar atmospheres and interiors , there is a much wider range of phenomena wherein intermolecular forces between media influence their behavior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , liquids less polarizable than the substrates upon which they stand will `` wet '' the surface by spreading into a thin film .    when studying the phases of matter one appeals to bulk phase diagrams .",
    "however , the presence of external fields ( e.g. , electric , magnetic , gravitational , intermolecular ) can shift the region of phase stability substantially such as exists in the interior of a star due to gravitationally enhanced pressure .",
    "so it is that the presence of intermolecular force fields across a surface shift the equilibrium states of matter from bulk coexistence and can stabilize the liquid phase in the solid region of the bulk phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this so - called _ interfacial premelting _ occurs in all classes of materials ; metals , rare gases , semiconductors , quantum solids and molecular solids , including ice wherein there are a host of astrophysical and geophysical consequences @xcite . for the present development",
    ", while i will often refer to liquid , it should be viewed as a _ synonym _ for _ the available high density phase _ which can be amorphous or another polymorph of the solid as discussed in section [ sec : liquidity ] .    the concept of damage assisted interfacial melting was developed by @xcite to describe mass and charge transfer in the ice / ice collision experiments of @xcite .",
    "this work is reviewed in @xcite and the basic mechanism has recently been adopted in a study of lightning in protoplanetary disks by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite theory focused on atmospheric ice rather than the very high pressures and very low temperatures that are encountered under nebular conditions , which substantially complicate the situation due to the detailed phase behavior of ice .",
    "consider the surface between a solid ( @xmath15 ) such as ice and the gas phase at a given temperature @xmath16 and pressure @xmath17 .",
    "when one considers the field energy / molecule due to intermolecular attractions ( polarization forces ) across such a surface , there is a shift of bulk phase coexistence @xmath18 describing the formation of a stable interfacial disordered or liquid film of thickness @xmath19 whose presence lowers the chemical potential of the wetted or disordered surface @xmath20 .",
    "hence , this disordered equilibrium layer has a chemical potential @xmath21 that is _ lower _ than the _ bulk _ liquid @xmath22 ; @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , a variety of forms of disorder lower @xmath21 ; surface roughness , polycrystallinity , excess strain produced intrinsic or surface induced dislocations or frank - read sources , impurities or kinetic effects @xcite .",
    "such effects can be responsible for the persistence of disorder in at least a few molecular layers to ultra high vacuum temperatures .",
    "importantly , all such forms of disorder can be present on the surface or within the bulk of nebular solids be they ice particles , growing from water vapor near the snow line , or warmer silicates in the inner nebula .",
    "although it is presently unfeasible to understand the detailed thermodynamic evolution of individual particles , the sign of the effect of disorder is the same for all .",
    "moreover , during interparticle collisions with speed @xmath0 the increased stress increases the density of disorder thereby further decreasing @xmath21 relative to the bulk liquid .",
    "all of these effects are embodied as damage induced disorder , @xmath24 , and hence the combined influence of intermolecular forces , preexisting and damage induced disorder is to reduce the chemical potential of the interfacial liquid as @xmath25 .    expanding @xmath26 about a point at coexistence , @xmath27 yields @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the latent heat of fusion , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the density of the solid phase ( liquid or high density phase ) , and for the usual form of nonretarded polarization forces @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the hamaker constant divided by @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath33 describes the strength of the polarization forces and is negative when the film is present @xcite .",
    "whence , a general thermodynamic relationship between the film thickness , the strength of the intermolecular forces and the damage induced energy density @xmath35 is found as @xmath36^{1/3}.   \\label{eq : fullfilm}\\ ] ] consider for example that two particles of ice at fixed temperature @xmath16 collide .",
    "the bulk sound speed in ice is @xmath37 cm s@xmath2 and the thermal diffusivity is @xmath38 @xmath39 s@xmath2 and thus only the interfacial region between the particles will relax thermally and mechanically and their remaining volume will dissipate the collision energy adiabatically . the rapid pressure build up during the collision @xmath40 drives the interfacial region towards equilibrium pressure at solid - liquid coexistence ; @xmath41 .",
    "whence , both @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "simultaneously a fraction @xmath10 of the collisional energy is converted into disorder enhanced interfacial damage @xmath44 ( some is lost through other channels such as e.g. , surface waves and stored in other degrees of freedom ) which lowers the chemical potential of the liquid phase .",
    "thus , the damage energy intervenes to further shift the onset of interfacial liquidity to values away from bulk coexistence . due to the rapid relaxation of the phonon modes in the interfacial region",
    ", thermodynamic state theory argues that , on the time scale of the collision , the damage associated with the collisional energy density is deposited uniformly over the maximum collisional area @xmath45 to a depth @xmath19 as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the kinetic energy of the collision with @xmath48 the effective two - body mass .",
    "analysis of equation ( [ eq : fullfilm ] ) for the range of astrophysically relevant particle sizes and collision energies shown in figures [ fig : v(crit ) ] and [ fig : v(range ) ] reveals that it is near the divergent limit , where the denominator vanishes , and hence @xmath49}.    \\label{eq : film}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : film ] ) shows that the detailed nature of the interactions responsible for the film become unimportant , but the form of the result depends on their existence in the first place .",
    "thus , for example , for other power law interactions driving interfacial melting the exponent in equation ( [ eq : fullfilm ] ) changes and for exponentially decaying forces , such as are present due to screening in metals from conduction electrons or intrinsic or impurity produced ions in ice , the relation can be logarithmic @xcite .",
    "however , regardless of the nature of the intermolecular interactions , the film thickness diverges by the same competition of effects in the numerator of equation ( [ eq : fullfilm ] ) and hence equation ( [ eq : film ] ) is the same for all . therefore , while small changes in the nature of the attractive interactions between small particles , be they polarization forces or of some other form @xcite , may influence the rate of growth of small agglomerations @xcite below the @xcite limit ( see figure [ fig : v(crit ) ] )",

    "equation [ eq : film ] shows that when the collisional energy is sufficiently high that the pressure and temperature reach their coexistence values @xmath84 and @xmath85 then @xmath19 diverges .",
    "firstly , it should be noted that over some ranges of collision speeds in liquid / liquid interactions of like material ( e.g. , water ) collisions are still described quantitatively by hertzian elasticity @xcite , using the laplace pressure as the `` young s modulus '' viz .",
    ", @xmath86 with @xmath87 the liquid / vapor surface tension .",
    "whereas , when a liquid droplet collides with a superhydrophobic substrate the collision time is shown to be insensitive to @xmath0 which differs from hertzian collisions @xcite wherein the collisional energy is stored in the interfacial region . secondly , the liquidity here is indeed localized over an interfacial region of volume @xmath88 that only diverges at a very large critical velocity ; for a given @xmath16 and @xmath71 there is an immeasurably narrow region of @xmath0 over which the young s modulus of the small particle drops significantly below the large solid value .",
    "nonetheless , when including this effect here it is found only to be operative at values of @xmath89 and thus irrelevant . even were this not the case",
    ", the effect would be to _ increase _ @xmath70 and allow the thermal inertia of the larger particle more time to refreeze the smaller particle .",
    "thirdly , the heterogeneity and crystallinity of most materials is likely to lead to fracture at such high collisional energies .",
    "hence , the rationale here is to simply increase the hertzian value of @xmath70 by the loss factor @xmath10 due to the fact that in the collisional range of relevance the elastic interactions are principally borne by the solid .      as described in section [ sec : nebular ] any calculation of the precise thermodynamic evolution of a given particle , and hence that of any particular two - body collision , is highly model dependent . here",
    ", the relevant phase behavior is described and the implications for other materials of particular relevance for the inner nebula are developed .    at temperatures as low as 150 @xmath8 and high collisional pressures ,",
    "ices ih and ic transform to supercooled water ( likely rapidly through metastable ices ii , iii or ix ) @xcite whereas at lower temperatures lda undergoes amorphization to hda in the same modality as has recently been studied at high temperatures in h - passivated si spheres @xcite .",
    "rapidly deposited vapor may form as porous lda but it will have ample time to anneal both thermally and due to cosmic irradiation @xcite and , unless continuous rapid growth continues ( which will allows the disorder to persist ) , such a particle will be either ice ih or ic upon collision . under the gpa pressures induced by typical high speed collisions these ices will , rapidly pass through the stable region of ice ix to transform into supercooled water @xcite .",
    "one can envision growth histories and outward drift trajectories to regions substantially lower than 150 @xmath8 , @xcite and thus collisions between lda ice , that can undergo an amorphization transition to hda ice , or annealed crystalline ice , can collisionally melt by a phonon softening mechanism @xcite represented by the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "regardless , the essential process discussed here is the same whether ice persists as lda and then undergoes collisionally induced high pressure polyamorphization to hda or anneals to ih or ic and collisions induce the formation of supercooled liquid @xcite .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations of @xcite provide an excellent example of damage induced polyamorphism and fusion in si which experimentally melts at @xmath5 1690 @xmath8 .",
    "they find that in high speed and hence high pressure collisions the @xmath90-tin phase forms in an interfacial region followed by picosecond annealing to the @xmath91-si phase .",
    "while their particles are sufficiently small that were they in the inner nebula they would be strongly coupled to the gas phase , the basic effect of low speed rebound ( @xmath92 900 m s@xmath2 ) and high speed ( @xmath92 1640 m s@xmath2 ) damage induced fusion is demonstrated . clearly too , perhaps using simulations such as those on silicon @xcite , it is important to microscopically examine the role of the depth of disorder / liquidity necessary to fuse particles . while here material with laboratory determined properties is used , it is understood that agglomeration of micron scale particles can create highly porous `` pre - planetesimals '' in experiments and simulations @xcite .",
    "however , one must appreciate that over nebular time scales annealing can densify , and rapid growth kinetically roughen , all classes of crystalline material @xcite .",
    "note too that while porous materials may be more fragile , the higher roughness and porosity of non - annealed particles can be treated in this framework and the results may be qualitatively the same , but the preexisting disorder enhances the interfacial effects leading to fusion .",
    "thus , when wholesale fracture or spalling does not intervene , the mechanism described here provides a conservative range of collisional fusion .",
    "a particle of radius @xmath93 in the disk exchanges angular momentum with other solids and with the pressure supported sub - keplerian nebular gas .",
    "whether the principal exchange of angular momentum is with the gas or the solids , one can derive equations of motion to predict the radial position of a particle in the disk @xmath94 as a function of time .",
    "when gas dominates then one needs a description of the gas density @xmath95 in the nebula , and when solids dominate their density @xmath96 determines the exchange process and hence the trajectory . while both density profiles are model dependent , a striking and robust result for the gas dominated exchange process , as first predicted by @xcite and @xcite , is that meter scale objects whose size does not change , rapidly spiral into the central star ; for @xmath97 = 1 au it would take approximately 100 years for @xmath98 = 0 .    in his study of the dynamics of planetary rings",
    "@xcite showed how the addition of mass , and hence angular momentum , from meteoroids controls the specific angular momentum of the system .",
    "thus , as the material adjusts to conserve its total angular momentum there is a net inward drift .",
    "@xcite studied these ideas in the context planetesimal growth using large scale numerical simulations in which they applied reynolds decomposition to a two - fluid model ( gas and solids ) of a nebula .",
    "they demonstrated that midplane conditions are such that the mass density of solids can substantially exceed that of the gas and yet turbulence still maintains conditions that do not allow the safronov - goldreich - ward instability to drive gravitational collapse .",
    "therefore , while in general angular momentum exchange with both the gas and the solids can drive a net inward drift , when @xmath99 solids dominate the angular momentum exchange and hence the drift rate . assuming perfect",
    "solid / solid sticking and assessing the angular momentum budget of drifters @xcite showed that their lifetime is dominated by the accretion of disk particles . here",
    ", the assumption of perfect sticking is abandoned and a simple analytical test of how the process of collisional fusion described here can influence the time evolution of accretion and hence the fate of a drifter is constructed as follows .    when a drifting pre - planetesimal of radius @xmath93 and mass @xmath100 receives additional mass by accretion of disk particles with average density @xmath96 , it receives a net addition of angular momentum  a net torque  that is balanced by its inward motion .",
