    "yvonne choquet - bruhat s epic work of over 50 years ago shows that if a set of smooth initial data which satisfies the einstein constraint equations is given , then we can always find a spacetime solution of the einstein equations which contains an embedded hypersurface whose metric and second fundamental form agree with the chosen data . in the years since then",
    ", arguably the most important method for constructing and studying solutions of einstein s equations has been the initial value ( or cauchy ) formulation of the theory , which is based on yvonne s result . especially now , with intense efforts underway to model astrophysical events which produce detectable gravitational radiation , the cauchy formulation and numerical efforts to implement it are of major interest to gravitational physicists .    to understand the cauchy formulation of einstein s theory of gravitation , we need to understand the constraint equations .",
    "not only do the constraints restrict the allowable choices of initial data for solutions ; they also effectively determine the function space of maximally globally hyperbolic solutions of the theory , and they play a role in generating the evolution of the initial data via their appearance in the hamiltonian for einstein s theory .",
    "the goal of this review paper is to provide some measure of understanding of the einstein constraints .",
    "we start in section 2 by explaining the geometric origin of the constraint equations . to do this , we discuss @xmath0 foliations of spacetimes , the gauss - codazzi decompositions of the curvature , and the consequent @xmath0 projection of the spacetime einstein equations .",
    "next , in section 3 , we discuss the relationship between the constraints and evolution . here , after first reviewing the proof of well - posedness , we discuss the adm hamiltonian formulation of einstein s theory , noting the relationship between the hamiltonian functional and the constraints .",
    "we also examine the evolution equations for the constraints , noting that if a set of data satisfies the constraints initially , it will continue to satisfy them for as long as the evolution continues .",
    "we discuss methods for constructing solutions of the einstein constraint equations in section 4 .",
    "we focus first on the most useful approach to date : the conformal method . after describing how the conformal method works ,",
    "we discuss its success in parameterizing the set of all constant mean curvature ( cmc ) solutions of the constraints , the difficulties which arise when constructing solutions with non - constant mean curvature , and the issue of finding physically relevant sets of data which satisfy the constraints .",
    "closely related to the conformal method is the conformal thin sandwich approach .",
    "we describe how it relates to the standard conformal method , and its major advantages and disadvantages .    instead of exploiting conformal variations to enforce the constraints ,",
    "the original thin sandwich formulation @xcite varies the lapse ( via an algebraic relation ) and the shift vector . under certain conditions",
    "this procedure leads to an elliptic system for the shift @xcite , and an implicit function theorem then shows that the system is solvable for all nearby data .",
    "this constructs an open set of solutions of the constraint equations , from unconstrained data .",
    "however , the restrictions arising from the surprising ellipticity condition , that @xmath1 be positive or negative definite , mean that the original thin sandwich approach is viable only for a limited range of geometries , and at this stage it must be considered more of a curiosity than a practical solution technique .",
    "it is also possible to construct solutions of the hamiltonian constraint by solving a semi - linear parabolic equation .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that the essential feature of the original `` quasi - spherical '' construction @xcite can be generalized beyond the quasi - spherical foliation condition to give a flexible technique for constructing exterior metrics of prescribed scalar curvature , satisfying geometric inner boundary conditions . whilst the resulting parabolic method is restricted by the requirement that the background must be quasi - convex , it is able to handle several questions involving the constraints which can not be addressed using the conformal method",
    ".    we finish our review of constraint construction techniques by discussing the idea of gluing , and how this idea has been implemented to date .",
    "two approaches to gluing have been developed and applied to solutions of the constraint equations .",
    "connected sum or imp gluing @xcite builds new solutions by adding a cylindrical bridge ( or wormhole ) connecting a pair of points either on a single given solution or on a pair of given solutions . the corvino - schoen technique @xcite gives a local projection from approximate solutions to exact solutions of the constraints .",
    "this may then be applied to smoothly attach a finite region in a given asymptotically euclidean solution to an exterior schwarzschild or kerr solution , with a transition region connecting the two regions .",
    "both approaches have been very useful in answering a number of longstanding questions regarding solutions of the constraints .",
    "we conclude this paper with a number of comments on important issues concerning the constraints which need to be addressed .",
    "the cauchy formulation is used primarily to construct new solutions of the einstein gravitational field equations from specified initial data . the best way to understand the origins of the constraint equations",
    "is to assume that we have a spacetime solution and to consider the induced data on spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "we do this here , showing that the constraint equations necessarily must be satisfied by initial data @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a manifold , @xmath4 is a riemannian metric on @xmath3 and @xmath5 is a symmetric tensor on @xmath3 , if this data is to be induced by a spacelike hypersurface in a spacetime solution of einstein s equations .",

    "a calculation similar to those used to derive the gauss and codazzi equations does not lead to an expression solely in terms of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and their spatial derivatives .",
    "if we introduce the lie derivative @xmath54 along with the lapse and its spatial derivatives , then we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the hessian or second covariant derivative of the lapse function @xmath28 .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the _ mainardi equation _ , and has the index form @xmath58 the index expressions for the gauss , codazzi and mainardi equations given above are useful for calculating the @xmath0 expressions for contractions of the riemann tensor , such as the ricci curvature tensor , the scalar curvature , and the einstein tensor .",
    "for example , the einstein tensor @xmath59 satisfies @xmath60 we note that these expressions for @xmath61 and @xmath62 involve just @xmath63 , and their spatial derivatives .",

    "the lapse and shift are determined from @xmath124 by solving the reduced einstein equations .",
    "alternatively , we may ask whether it is possible to _ prescribe _ the lapse and shift as given functions of @xmath125 and @xmath25 ( for example , @xmath126 and @xmath127 for all @xmath13 and @xmath128 ) . as shown recently by choquet - bruhat @xcite ,",
    "this is possible although in a weaker sense than the einstein system in the wave map gauge described above . specifically , the einstein system for general lapse and shift is `` non - strictly hyperbolic '' ; as a consequence , the system is well - posed in gevrey spaces , and so has local existence .",
    "we note as well that a number of researchers @xcite have formulated extended first order versions of einstein s vacuum equations and have verified symmetric hyperbolicity and therefore well - posedness in more standard spaces for these versions .    because the initial lapse - shift variables @xmath129 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : gadm ] ) ) are freely specifiable in the above construction , there remains the question of the uniqueness of the spacetime development of a given set of initial data .",
    "it turns out that solutions constructed using different choices of the lapse and the shift but the same geometric data @xmath70 are in fact equal in some neighbourhood of the initial surface , after suitable coordinate changes @xcite .",
    "this property is established by constructing a wave map @xmath130 from one solution to the other , and using the identification of the initial data to ensure the wave map initially at least is a spacetime isometry .",
    "the two metrics can then be compared directly ( via @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) , and uniqueness for the reduced einstein equations leads to geometric uniqueness .",
    "this shows that the geometric data @xmath70 determine the resulting spacetime uniquely , at least locally .",
    "if we fix a choice of the lapse and shift for which the system of einstein s equations is well - posed ( see the discussion above ) , then einstein s equations can be viewed formally as a dynamical system .",
    "more specifically , fixing a three dimensional manifold @xmath11 and letting @xmath133 denote the tangent space to the space @xmath134 of smooth riemannian metrics on @xmath11 , we find that ( with a fixed choice of lapse @xmath28 and shift @xmath20 ) the einstein evolution equations @xmath135 specify a flow on @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath136 evolution equation follows from the mainardi equation , cf .",
    "( [ mainardi ] ) and ( [ kevolution ] ) . for the vacuum einstein case @xmath137 ; in the nonvacuum case , @xmath138 depends on the matter fields through the stress - energy tensor @xmath66 .",
    "there is an important sense in which the constraints generate the flow , which we see by recasting einstein s theory in the canonical hamiltonian form .",
    "originally motivated by attempts to obtain a theory of gravity consistent with quantum theory , and often labeled the `` adm '' hamiltonian formulation because of the early work on these ideas by arnowitt , deser and misner @xcite , this is based on the analysis of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath139 .    one way to approach",
    "this analysis is via the second variation formula for spacelike hypersurfaces @xcite ; for more traditional treatments see @xcite .",

    "in @xcite it is shown that this condition is equivalent to the vanishing of the taub quantity , constructed from a solution of the linearized einstein equations about a spacetime admitting a killing vector .",
    "the situation for asymptotically flat spacetimes differs significantly from the case of compact @xmath11 . using weighted sobolev spaces ( with local regularity @xmath212 , @xmath213 ) it is possible to show that the @xmath198 is everywhere a hilbert submanifold @xcite ; although killing vectors such as rotations are possible , they do not satisfy the asymptotic conditions needed to prevent surjectivity of @xmath203 and thus the quadratic conditions on constrained variations do not arise .",
    "this work @xcite also shows that the asymptotically flat phase space @xmath214 provides a natural setting in which the adm hamiltonian and energy - momentum functionals become smooth functions , for example .",
    "there are three reasons for seeking to construct and study solutions of the einstein constraint equations .",
    "first , we would like to obtain initial data sets which model the initial states of physical systems .",
    "evolving such data , we can model the gravitational physics of those physical systems .",
    "second , we would like to understand the space of all globally hyperbolic solutions of einstein s gravitational field equations .",
    "since , as noted earlier , einstein s equations are well - posed , the space of solutions of the constraints parametrizes the space of solutions of the spacetime field equations .",
    "third , we would like to know enough about the nature of the space of solutions of the constraints and the hamiltonian dynamics of the classical einstein equations on this space to be able to consider descriptions of gravitational physics which are consistent with the quantum principle ( i.e. , to `` quantize gravity '' ) .    the easiest way to find a set of initial data @xmath2 which satisfies the einstein constraint equations is to first find an explicit solution @xmath215 of the spacetime einstein equations ( e.g. , the schwarzschild or kerr solutions ) , and then to choose a cauchy surface @xmath216 in that spacetime solution : the induced riemannian metric @xmath4 and second fundamental form @xmath5 on @xmath3 together solve the constraints . since the set of known spacetime solutions is very limited , this procedure is not especially useful for making progress towards the goals discussed above ( although we shall see below that solutions of the constraints obtained from slices of known spacetime solutions can be very handy as building blocks for `` gluing constructions '' of solutions of the constraints , which are in turn potentially very useful for modeling physical systems ) .",
    "our focus here is on more comprehensive methods for finding and studying solutions of the constraints .",
    "we first discuss the conformal method .",
    "this is by far the most widely used approach , both for physical modeling and for mathematical analyses , and so it receives the bulk of our attention here .",
    "we next consider the thin sandwich and conformal thin sandwich ideas .",
    "the latter is closely related to the conformal method ; we compare and contrast the two here .",
    "the fourth approach we consider is the quasi - spherical ansatz . although not as comprehensive as the conformal method , the quasi - spherical ansatz is potentially useful for certain key applications , which we discuss below .",
    "we conclude by describing the recently developed procedures for gluing together known solutions of the constraints , thereby producing new ones .    for convenience , we work primarily in this paper with the vacuum constraint equations .",
    "we note , however , that most of what we discuss here generalizes to the einstein - maxwell , einstein - yang - mills , einstein - fluid , and other such nonvacuum field theories .      the vacuum einstein constraint equations ( [ hcon ] ) , ( [ pcon ] ) with @xmath217 and @xmath218 constitute an underdetermined system of four equations to be solved for twelve unknowns @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the idea of the conformal method is to divide the initial data on @xmath3 into two sets  the `` free ( conformal ) data '' , and the `` determined data''in such a way that , given a choice of the free data , the constraint equations become a _ determined _ elliptic pde system to be solved for the determined data .",
    "there are at least two ways to do this ( see @xcite for others ) .",
    "the sets of free data and determined data are the same for both procedures ; we have    free ( `` conformal '' ) data : : :       +    [ cols=\">,^ , < \" , ]    |=======================================================================    |@xmath219 | |a riemannian metric , specified up to    conformal factor ;      |@xmath220 | |a    divergence - free(@xmath221 ) , trace - free    ( @xmath222 )      | | |symmetric tensor ;      |@xmath223 | |a scalar field ,    |======================================================================= determined data : : :       +    [ cols=\">,^ , < \" , ]    |========================================================    |@xmath91 | |a positive definite scalar field ,    |@xmath224 | |a vector field .    |========================================================    the difference between the two procedures has to do with the form of the equations to be solved for the determined data , and the way in which the two sets of data are combined to obtain @xmath4 and @xmath5 satisfying the constraints . in one of the procedures , which we label the `` semi - decoupling split '' ( historically called `` method a '' )",

    "if one chooses the mean curvature @xmath223 to be constant , then the @xmath91 dependence drops from ( [ confmoma ] ) , and the the focus of the analysis is on ( [ lichneroa ] ) , the lichnerowicz equation .",
    "this is not true for the conformally covariant split ; however in this latter case , one finds that a solution exists for free data @xmath234 if and only if a solution exists for @xmath235 .",
    "far more is known mathematically about the semi - decoupling split , and this approach has been used much more in applications , so we focus on the semi - decoupling split in the rest of this paper .",
    "we do note , however , that numerical relativists have very recently begun to apply the conformally covariant split for certain studies @xcite .",
    "is it true that , for every choice of the free data @xmath236 , one can always solve equations ( [ confmoma ] ) and ( [ lichneroa ] ) for the determined data @xmath237 and thereby obtain a solution of the constraint equations ?",
    "it is easy to see that this is not the case : let us choose the manifold @xmath3 to be the three sphere , and on @xmath3 we choose a metric @xmath238 with non - negative scalar curvature , we choose @xmath239 to be zero everywhere , and we choose @xmath223 to be unity everywhere .",
    "one readily verifies that every solution to the equation @xmath240 has @xmath241 .",
    "the lichnerowicz equation then becomes @xmath242 .",

    "the main question is really the following : for which choices of the manifold @xmath3 and the free data can one solve ( [ confmoma ] ) and ( [ lichneroa ] ) ?",
    "it turns out that we know quite a bit about the answer to this question , yet still have quite a bit to learn as well . to describe what we know and do not know ,",
    "it is useful to categorize the question using the following criteria :    manifold and asymptotic conditions : :    * closed    * asymptotically euclidean    * asymptotically hyperbolic    * compact with boundary conditions    * asymptotically euclidean with interior boundary conditions regularity : :    * analytic    * smooth    * sobolev and holder classes    * weak    * asymptotic fall off conditions at infinity metric conformal classes : :    * yamabe positive    * yamabe zero    * yamabe negative mean curvature : :    * constant ( `` cmc '' )    * near constant ( small    @xmath244 )    * non constant @xmath245 classes : :    * @xmath239 is zero everywhere on @xmath3    * @xmath239 not zero everywhere on @xmath3    the mean curvature of the data turns out to be the most important factor in separating those sets of free data for which we know whether or not a solution exists from those sets for which we do not . in fact , if the mean curvature is either constant or near constant , we can almost completely determine whether or not a solution exists ( at least in those cases with no boundaries present ) . on the other hand , if the mean curvature is neither constant nor near constant , we know very little . for sufficiently smooth free data , we may summarize the known results as follows :    constant mean curvature : :    * _ closed _ : completely determined . for all but certain special cases    ( see example discussed above ) , solutions exist .",

    "this summary is the compilation of results from a large number of works ( note references listed above ) , including some not yet written up .",
    "the summary is fairly sketchy , since there is inadequate space here to include many of the details .",
    "we do , however , wish to give a flavor of what these results say more precisely , and how they are proven . to do this we shall discuss a few representative sub - cases .",
    "we first consider the case in which the manifold is presumed closed , and in which we choose free data with constant @xmath223 .",
    "as noted above , as a consequence of the cmc condition , the equation ( [ confmoma ] ) for @xmath78 is readily solved , and we have @xmath246 . what remains is the lichnerowicz equation , which takes the form @xmath247    there are three key pde analysis theorems which allow us to determine , for any set of free data consistent with these conditions , whether or not a solution to the lichnerowicz equation exists .",
    "we state each of these theorems in a form most suited for this purpose ( see @xcite for much more detail ) :    1 .   _",
    "the maximum principle : _ if we choose free data such that for any @xmath248 the right hand side of the lichnerowicz equation ( [ lichnero ] ) is either positive definite or negative definite , then ( with @xmath3 presumed closed ) for that free data there can be no solution .",
    "the yamabe theorem : _ for any given riemannian metric @xmath238 on a closed three manifold , there is a conformally related metric @xmath249 which has constant scalar curvature .",
    "for fixed @xmath238 , all such conformally - related constant scalar curvature metrics have the same sign for the scalar curvature .",
    "this allows one to partition the set of all riemannian metrics on @xmath3 into three classes , depending on this sign .",
    "we label these _ yamabe classes _ as follows : @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and @xmath252 .",
    "if there exist a pair of positive functions @xmath253 such that @xmath254 and @xmath255 then there exists a solution @xmath91 of the lichnerowicz equation ( [ lichnero ] ) , with @xmath256    the yamabe theorem is very useful because the lichnerowicz equation in the form ( [ lichnero ] ) ( with @xmath246 ) is conformally covariant in the sense that it has a solution for a set of free data @xmath257 if and only if some function @xmath258 it has a solution for the free data @xmath259 .",
    "hence , to check solubility for a given set of free data , we can always first perform a preliminary conformal transformation on the data and therefore work with data for which the scalar curvature is constant .",
    "it is now straightforward to use the maximum principle ( together with the yamabe theorem ) to show that there is a collection of classes of cmc free data for which no solution exists .",
    "this holds for all of the following classes of free data : @xmath260 note that here,``@xmath261 '' means that the tensor @xmath239 is not identically zero on @xmath3 .",
    "it is true , though not so simple to show , that for all other classes of cmc free data on a closed manifold , a solution does exist .",
    "we show this using the sub and super solution theorem .",
    "for free data of the type @xmath262 , it is relatively easy to show that there are constant sub and super solutions .",
    "we merely need to find a constant @xmath263 sufficiently large so that @xmath264 is everywhere positive , and a constant @xmath265 sufficiently small ( yet positive ) so that @xmath266 is everywhere negative .",
    "constant sub and super solutions are also readily found for free data of the type @xmath267 , or @xmath268 .",
    "for the remaining types of free data , we need to find either a nonconstant sub solution or a nonconstant super solution .",
    "this takes a bit of work ; we show how to do it in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the proof of the sub and super solution theorem ( see @xcite ) is a constructive one : starting with the super solution @xmath263 , one solves a sequence of linear equations , and one then shows that the monotonic sequence of solutions @xmath269 converges to a solution of the lichnerowicz equation .",
    "this constructibility can be useful for numerical relativity , as has been shown in @xcite .",
    "we next consider the case in which the free data is chosen to be asymptotically euclidean ( see , for example , @xcite for a definition of this property ) , with @xmath270 .",
    "for asymptotically euclidean metrics , a yamabe type theorem again plays a key role . proven by brill and cantor @xcite , with a correction by maxwell @xcite",
    ", this result says that if @xmath238 is asymptotically euclidean , and if for every nonvanishing , compactly supported , smooth function @xmath271 we have @xmath272 then for some conformal factor @xmath273 , the scalar curvature of @xmath249 is zero .",
    "moreover , if an asymptotically euclidean metric fails to satisfy this condition , then there is no such transformation .",
    "metrics which do satisfy this condition have been labeled ( somewhat misleadingly ) as `` positive yamabe metrics '' .",
    "the positive yamabe property just defined is exactly the condition which determines if , for a set of asymptotically euclidean free data , the lichnerowicz equation admits a solution .",
    "that is , as proven in @xcite , ( [ lichnero ] ) admits a solution @xmath91 with suitable asymptotic properties if and only if the ( asymptotically euclidean ) free data @xmath274 has positive yamabe metric @xmath238 .",
    "this is true regardless of whether @xmath239 vanishes or not . this result is not proven directly using a sub and super solution theorem , but the proof does involve a converging sequence of solutions of linear equations , and is therefore again constructive .",
    "the last case we consider here is that of near constant mean curvature free data on closed manifolds .",
    "this case is more complicated than the cmc case , since now we must work with the coupled system ( [ confmoma])-([lichneroa ] ) .",
    "however , with sufficient control over the gradient of @xmath223 , we can handle the coupled system , and determine whether or not solutions exist for almost all sets of near cmc free data .",
    "the key extra tool we use to carry out this analysis is the elliptic estimate for the `` vector laplacian '' operator @xmath275 appearing on the left side of ( [ confmoma ] ) .",
    "such a result holds for any linear , elliptic , invertible operator @xcite such as this one .",
    "is invertible only if @xmath238 has no conformal killing field .",

    ", we obtain a _ pointwise _",
    "estimate of the form @xmath283 where @xmath284 is also a constant depending only on the geometry @xmath282 .",
    "this pointwise inequality ( [ lwestimate ] ) is the crucial estimate which allows us to handle the coupled system , for sufficiently small @xmath285 .    to see how to prove that a solution exists in one of these near cmc cases ,",
    "let us consider free data with @xmath286 , and with @xmath287 sufficiently small .",

    "the existence of a solution @xmath291 follows from the invertibility of the vector laplacian . for ( [ lichneroa - n ] )",
    ", existence follows from the sub and super solution theorem , since we readily find a sequence of constant sub and super solutions for this choice of free data .",
    "we next show that there are ( positive ) uniform upper and lower bounds for the sequence @xmath292 .",
    "this is where we first need to use the estimate ( [ lwestimate ] ) for @xmath293 : specifically , after arguing that there is a uniform ( constant ) upper bound for the @xmath294 s if we can find a positive constant @xmath295 such that @xmath296 we use the @xmath293 estimates to show that it is sufficient to find a positive constant @xmath295 satisfying @xmath297 we immediately see that if , for fixed @xmath238 and @xmath239 , we choose @xmath298 sufficiently small , then such a @xmath295 exists . the existence of the uniform upper bound for @xmath294 follows .",
    "establishing these uniform bounds is the crucial step in our proof that solutions exist for free data of the type we are discussing here , as well as for other classes of near cmc free data .",
    "once we have these bounds , we can carry through a contraction mapping argument to show that the sequence @xmath290 converges ( a bit more squeezing of @xmath285 is needed to carry this out ) .",
    "we can then go on to use continuity arguments to show that the limit is a weak solution , and finally use bootstrap arguments to show that in fact the weak solution is a strong solution , of the desired smoothness .",
    "the details of this proof are presented in @xcite .",
    "a very similar argument can be used to prove that equations ( [ confmoma])-([lichneroa ] ) admit solutions for a number of classes of near cmc free data , including the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath299 , and @xmath300 sufficiently small ; 2 .",
    "@xmath301 , @xmath239 not identically zero , and @xmath302 sufficiently small ; 3 .",
    "@xmath303 , @xmath223 nowhere zero , @xmath239 not identically zero , and @xmath304 sufficiently small .    what about the other near cmc cases on closed @xmath3 ?",
    "just recently , with niall omurchadha , we have found for the first time a class of near cmc free data for which a solution _ does not _ exist .",
    "the data is of the following type : @xmath305 the proof that no solution exists for free data of this type is a relatively simple application of the pointwise estimate ( [ lwestimate ] ) for @xmath276 discussed above , and the maximum principle .",
    "the details are presented in @xcite . as for near cmc data on a closed manifold which is not one of the types discussed here ,",
    "nothing is yet known .",
    "note that , in a rough sense , these remaining unresolved cases are not generic .",
    "as noted in the summary above , there are a number of other classes of free data for which we know whether or not solutions to ( [ confmoma])-([lichneroa ] ) exist .",
    "methods similar to those discussed here resolve the existence question for most cmc or near cmc free data which are asymptotically euclidean or asymptotically hyperbolic , as well for such data on closed manifolds .",
    "the situation for free data specified on compact manifolds with boundary is much less understood ; however this is most likely a result of neglect rather than difficulty . since numerical relativity has motivated a recent interest in this question , and since the methods discussed here are believed to work for data on manifolds with boundary , it is likely that in the next few years , the solvability of ( [ confmoma])-([lichneroa ] ) for such data is likely to be relatively well understood .",
    "indeed , this motivation has led to the very recent results of maxwell @xcite and dain @xcite , who give sufficient conditions on asymptotically euclidean free data with interior `` apparent horizon '' boundary conditions for solutions to exist    the situation is very different for non - constant mean curvature data with no controls on @xmath285 .",
    "almost nothing is known , and there are no promising techniques known at this point .",
    "new ideas are needed .",
    "it is worth noting that the underlying approach of specifying the mean extrinsic curvature @xmath223 is geometrically natural , since the converse problem , of finding a hypersurface of prescribed mean curvature in a given spacetime , leads to a quasi - linear elliptic equation bearing some similarities with the euclidean minimal surface equation .",
    "it is known that solutions of the lorentz mean curvature equation are strictly spacelike and smooth , at least to the extent permitted by the regularity of the ambient spacetime and boundary conditions , so such prescribed mean curvature hypersurfaces provide natural spacelike slices of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "although there are examples of spacetimes not admitting maximal ( @xmath306 , @xcite ) or cmc ( @xmath307 , @xcite , @xcite ) hypersurfaces , such non - existence behaviour is driven by global causal topology , which allows area - maximising sequences of hypersurfaces to become unbounded to the past or future ; see @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that _ a priori _ control of the interior causal geometry is an essential ingredient in the proof of existence of entire maximal hypersurfaces in asymptotically flat spacetimes @xcite .    to wind up this discussion of the implementation of the conformal method to find solutions of the constraint equations ,",
    "it is important to note two facts : 1 ) the map from sets of free data to solutions of the constraints is surjective .",
    "this follows from the observation that if @xmath308 is a solution of the constraints , then @xmath309 is clearly a solution of ( [ confmoma]-[lichneroa ] ) for the free data @xmath310 .",
    "2 ) for all those sets of free data for which solutions of ( [ confmoma]-[lichneroa ] ) are known to exist ( excepting for the very special case of @xmath238 flat , @xmath311 , and @xmath312 on @xmath313 ) the solution is unique .    as a consequence of these facts , those sets of free data for which solutions exist together parametrize the space of constraint - satisfying initial data for einstein s equations .",
    "it follows that , once we determine exactly which free data sets map to solutions , we will have made significant progress toward understanding the `` degrees of freedom '' of einstein s theory .    also as a consequence of these facts , if we seek initial data invariant under an isometry group , it is sufficient to choose free data with this invariance .    in view of the dominant role",
    "the conformal method has assumed as a tool for mathematical as well as numerical analyses of the constraints , it is important to point out its limitations . as noted above , the conformal method replaces the original underdetermined pde system of the constraint equations ( four equations to be solved for twelve unknowns ) , by a determined system of elliptic character .",
    "this is very useful for a wide variety of studies ( such as the parametrization question ) .",
    "however for a number of other problems , it is a bad idea .",
    "consider for example a given solution of the constraint equations on a finite radius ball .",
    "can one smoothly extend the solution onto a neighborhood properly containing the ball ? can it be smoothly extended to a complete , asymptotically euclidean solution ? might there be a smooth extension which is identically schwarzschild or kerr outside some ( larger ) ball ? to study questions like these , casting the constraint equations into the form of a determined elliptic system is not at all useful .",
    "it is better to bypass the conformal method and work with the original underdetermined system .",
    "some time ago , wheeler @xcite discussed a possible alternative to the initial value formulation for determining a spacetime solution of einstein s equations .",
    "rather than specifying initial data in the form of a riemannian metric @xmath4 and a symmetric tensor @xmath5 which satisfy the einstein constraint equations , he asked whether one might specify a pair of riemannian metrics @xmath314 and @xmath315 and seek to find a ( unique ? ) spacetime @xmath316 in which @xmath317 arise as the induced metrics on disjoint cauchy surfaces in @xmath318 , and which satisfies the einstein equations i.e.  @xmath319 is the spacetime solution `` connecting '' @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "this is the _",

    "hence there is reason to believe that the uniqueness assertion in the sandwich conjecture for the einstein equations may also be false .",
    "this led wheeler to instead propose the _ thin sandwich conjecture _ , which postulates that given a freely chosen riemannian metric @xmath4 and symmetric tensor @xmath320 representing the time derivative of the metric evolution in a spacetime ,",

    "an implicit function theorem argument @xcite shows then that the rtse is solvable for all data @xmath324 in an _ open _ neighbourhood of a reference configuration @xmath337 satisfying the conditions ( [ eq : rtsecond],[eq : lapsecond],[eq : eqnx ] ) . here",
    "`` open '' is with respect to a sobolev space in which the rtse are posed .",
    "the fact that the thin sandwich equations can be solved for an open class of data @xmath324 can be interpreted as showing that this reformulation of the constraints leads to `` generic '' solutions .",
    "however , ( [ eq : rtsecond ] ) is rather restrictive  it excludes asymptotically flat data for example  so these conditions , taken together , limit the prospects of constructing most interesting spacetime initial data via the thin sandwich approach .",
    "an interesting hybrid of the conformal method and the thin sandwich approach has been suggested by york @xcite . before specifying how this _ conformal thin sandwich _",
    "approach works , let us briefly compare the two approaches discussed so far :    1 .",
    "conformal method : the free data consists of a conformal metric @xmath219 , a divergence - free trace - free tensor field @xmath220 , and a scalar field @xmath223 ( 8 free functions ) . solving the constraints produces a vector field @xmath78 and a scalar field @xmath91 ( 4 functions ) .",
    "we recompose to get a metric @xmath193 and a symmetric tensor @xmath338 satisfying the constraints ( 12 functions ) .",
    "the lapse and shift are ignored .",
    "thin sandwich : the free data consists of a metric @xmath193 and a symmetric tensor @xmath339 ( 12 free functions ) . solving the constraints produces a vector field @xmath330 and a scalar field @xmath28 ( 4 functions ) .",
    "we recompose to get a metric @xmath193 and a symmetric tensor @xmath338 satisfying the constraints , plus the lapse @xmath28 and the shift @xmath330 ( 16 functions ) .    the idea of the conformal thin sandwich approach is to specify as free data a conformal metric @xmath219 , a trace - free symmetric tensor @xmath340 , a scalar field @xmath223 , and another scalar field @xmath341 . in terms of the loose function counting system used above , this amounts to 12 free functions . in the spirit of the thin sandwich ,",
    "the tensor @xmath340 represents the time derivative of the conformal metric , while @xmath223 is the mean curvature and @xmath341 represents the lapse function , up to a conformal factor .",
    "it follows from this interpretation , together with a choice of conformal scaling , that the second fundamental form @xmath338 is expressed as @xmath342 where @xmath330 is the shift vector and @xmath130 is the conformal factor , neither of which is known at this stage . to determine @xmath330 and @xmath130 , we use the constraint equations .",
    "these take the form @xmath343 and @xmath344 where we use the convenient short hand @xmath345 .",
    "thus , if we can solve ( [ eq:15]-[eq:16 ] ) for @xmath20 and @xmath130 ( 4 functions ) , we have @xmath346 ( obtained from ( [ ctsk ] ) ) and @xmath347 satisfying the constraints , plus a specification of the lapse @xmath348 and the shift @xmath330 .",
    "compared to the conformal method ( `` cm '' ) , the conformal thin sandwich approach ( `` ctsa '' ) has a number of virtues :    1 .",
    "unlike cm , specifying a set of ctsa free data does not require a projection to the divergence - free part of a symmetric tracefree 2-tensor .",
    "the map from ctsa free data to a solution of the constraint equations is conformally covariant in the sense that if @xmath107 is a solution corresponding to a particular choice of free data @xmath349 , then it is also a solution for the ctsa data @xmath350 , for any positive function @xmath273 .",
    "this is true whether or not @xmath223 is constant , whereas cm data has this property only if @xmath223 is constant .",
    "the mathematical form and hence the mathematical analysis of the ctsa equations ( [ eq:15])([eq:16 ] ) is very similar to that of the cm equations ( [ confmoma])([lichneroa ] ) .",
    "hence we have essentially the same existence and uniqueness results for the two sets of equations .",
    "ctsa free data is arguably closer to the physics we wish to model , since it includes the time derivative of the conformal metric , while the cm data only has the divergence - free trace - free ( transverse traceless ) part of the second fundamental form .    along with these virtues",
    ", ctsa has one troubling feature : say we want to find a set of cmc initial data @xmath107 with the lapse function chosen so that the evolving data continues to have constant mean curvature . in the case of the conformal method , after solving ( [ confmoma ] ) and ( [ lichneroa ] ) to obtain a solution of the constraints , one achieves this by solving a linear elliptic equation for the lapse function .",
    "this equation is not coupled to the constraint equations , and solutions are readily verified to exist . by contrast , in the ctsa the extra equation takes the form @xmath351 which is coupled to the ctsa equations ( [ eq:15])([eq:16 ] ) .",
    "this coupling can not be removed by choosing @xmath223 constant . indeed , whether the data is cmc or not , the mathematical analysis of the full system ( [ eq:15][ctsa - cmc ] ) is not very tractable .",
    "we emphasise , however , that if we do not require that the lapse be chosen to preserve the mean curvature , then the analysis of the ctsa equations is no more difficult than that of the conformal method equations . for further discussion of the conformal thin sandwich approach , both in theory and in practice , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was first shown in @xcite that 3-metrics of prescribed scalar curvature can be constructed by solving a certain _ parabolic _ equation on @xmath352 .",
    "this leads to a method for constructing solutions of the hamiltonian constraint which has found some interesting applications @xcite .    to describe the general construction @xcite ,",
    "consider the second variation identity for a foliation @xmath353 in a riemannian 3-manifold with metric @xmath354 , @xmath355 where @xmath14 is the outward unit normal vector to the level sets @xmath356 , @xmath357 is the second fundamental form , @xmath358 is the mean curvature , and @xmath359 , @xmath360 are respectively the gauss curvature and laplacian of the metric @xmath361 on the foliation 2-surfaces ( which are usually assumed to be topological 2-spheres ) .",
    "this is the riemannian version of the lorentzian formula ( [ eq:2varv ] ) .",
    "the name `` second variation '' arises from the term @xmath362 , since the mean curvature measures the first variation of the area of @xmath356 .",
    "this interpretation is not important for the present application , although it does reflect some deep relationship between mean curvature and minimal surfaces on the one hand , and positivity properties of mass on the other @xcite .",
    "consider ( [ 2varm ] ) when the surface variation @xmath363 defines a foliation , so the metric takes the general form @xmath364 where @xmath365 , @xmath366 and the rescaled angular metric @xmath367 are arbitrary fields . the _ quasi - spherical _ ( qs ) case considered in @xcite arises as the special case where @xmath368 is the standard 2-sphere metric .",
    "generally , the mean curvature of the leaves @xmath356 is @xmath369 where @xmath370 is the divergence of the tangential vector field @xmath371 in the metric @xmath372 , and @xmath373 is the exterior - directed unit normal vector . assume throughout the _ quasiconvexity condition _ @xmath374 and let @xmath375 , @xmath376 , @xmath377 be the corresponding quantities determined by the metric ( [ eq : qs ] ) with @xmath378 .",
    "the key observation is that substituting @xmath190 from ( [ mcsr ] ) into @xmath379 gives a term @xmath380 which combines with the term @xmath381 to show that if the scalar curvature is specified then ( [ 2varm ] ) may be read as a parabolic equation for the lapse @xmath382 .",
    "here @xmath383 , @xmath384 can be freely chosen , subject only to the quasiconvexity condition ( [ hdef ] ) , or equivalently , @xmath385 . explicitly we have @xmath386 which clearly shows the parabolic structure of the equation satisfied by @xmath382 .    thus if @xmath387 is determined by the hamiltonian constraint equation ( [ hcon ] ) and @xmath388 , @xmath384 are regarded as prescribed fields , then solving ( [ gqseqn ] ) leads to a 3-metric which satisfies the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "global ( @xmath389 ) existence theorems were established for ( [ gqseqn ] ) in the quasi - spherical case @xmath368 @xcite , assuming @xmath388 satisfies the quasiconvexity condition ( [ hdef ] ) , which becomes @xmath390 , and assuming the prescribed scalar curvature is not too positive ( @xmath391 is sufficient but not necessary ) . with suitable decay conditions on the prescribable fields @xmath383 ( for example , if @xmath383 is compactly supported ) , these results give asymptotically flat solutions of the hamiltonian constraint , with either black hole @xmath392 or regular centre @xmath393 inner boundary conditions .",
    "setting @xmath394 gives a large class of solutions of the vacuum hamiltonian constraint ( [ hcon ] ) in the _ time - symmetric _",
    "case @xmath395 , with two degrees of freedom corresponding to the choice of @xmath383 .",
    "analogous results have been established for general @xmath384 @xcite , which demonstrate that this provides a flexible technique for extending solutions to be asymptotically flat , or asymptotically hyperboloidal if @xmath396 .",
    "the parabolic method enables us to construct metrics of prescribed scalar curvature which have properties not achievable by conformal methods .",
    "for example , any bounded domain @xmath397 with smooth mean - convex ( @xmath385 ) boundary @xmath398 and non - negative scalar curvature can be extended smoothly to an asymptotically flat manifold , also with @xmath399 ; we simply extend the gaussian normal foliation in a neighbourhood of @xmath400 smoothly to a metric which is flat outside a neighbourhood of @xmath401 , with a mean - convex exterior foliation approaching the standard spherical foliation of @xmath402 . solving the parabolic lapse equation for @xmath399 with initial data @xmath378 on a gaussian level set",
    "@xmath403 produces the required 3-metric .",
    "one consequence of this argument , first observed in @xcite , is the existence of @xmath404 metrics on @xmath402 which are asymptotically flat and non - flat , but which have a flat interior region .",
    "the parabolic method also gives solutions satisfying `` geometric boundary conditions '' @xcite @xmath405 , which specify the boundary metric @xmath406 and mean curvature @xmath190 .",
    "this is clear from ( [ mcsr ] ) since @xmath190 is determined by specifying the well - posed initial condition @xmath407 for the parabolic lapse equation .",
    "note that this is not possible with conformal methods , since specifying both the boundary metric and mean curvature leads to simultaneous dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on the conformal factor .",
    "these boundary conditions are ill - posed for the elliptic equation imposed on the conformal factor , which will not then admit any solution in general .",
    "the problem of constructing 3-metrics with prescribed boundary metric and mean curvature arises naturally from the geometric definition of quasi - local mass @xcite and provided the original motivation for the quasi - spherical construction .",
    "examples of 3-metrics satisfying the geroch ( inverse mean curvature flow ) foliation condition @xcite can be constructed by choosing @xmath383 , @xmath384 satisfying @xmath408 and then solving the parabolic lapse equation with suitably prescribed scalar curvature .",
    "this provides a large class of metrics for which the geroch identity directly verifies the penrose conjecture . note that this does not help to solve the much harder problem considered in @xcite , of finding a geroch foliation in a _ given _ metric .",
    "another advantage of the parabolic lapse method is that it is generally easier and cheaper numerically to solve a 2 + 1 parabolic equation than the 3d elliptic equations arising in the conformal methods , particularly when the solution is required near spatial infinity . finally , in the original quasi - spherical gauge @xcite , the freely - specifiable fields @xmath409 give a rather explicit parameterization of the `` true degrees of freedom '' allowed by the hamiltonian constraint , since fixing @xmath388 removes all diffeomorphism freedom in the quasi - spherical gauge ( at the linearized level at least ) .",
    "dual to the problem of _ constructing _ metrics having quasi - spherical form , is the harder problem of _ finding _ a quasi - spherical foliation in a given metric .",
    "some simple observations suggest that qs foliations exist for general perturbations of a qs metric , but for interesting technical reasons a complete proof is not yet available .",
    "write the general qs 3-metric as @xmath410 where @xmath411 , @xmath412 is an orthonormal coframe for the unit sphere @xmath352 , and consider the effect of an infinitesimal diffeomorphism generated by @xmath413 , where @xmath414 is the dual frame to @xmath411 .",
    "the qs condition will be preserved under the metric variation @xmath415 and infinitesimal diffeomorphism @xmath20 exactly when @xmath416 , which gives the equation @xmath417 taking trace and trace - free projections and simplifying gives @xmath418 where @xmath419 and @xmath420 the operator @xmath421 in ( [ db ] ) is elliptic exactly when @xmath422 , and we can show that its adjoint @xmath423 has trivial kernel when @xmath424 ( pointwise ) .",
    "this latter condition also guarantees that @xmath425 is surjective , whereupon ( [ db ] ) can be solved for @xmath426 , uniquely if the @xmath427 spherical harmonic components of @xmath428 are specified . hence existence of qs coordinates can be established at the linearized level , but the presence of @xmath429 in the expression for @xmath430 means that it is not possible to directly apply an implicit function theorem to conclude the existence for all metrics in an open neighbourhood of @xmath431 .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the direct approach to finding quasi - spheres as graphs over @xmath352 in @xmath402 . from the second fundamental form of the graph @xmath432 , @xmath433 , @xmath434 where @xmath435 is the @xmath352 metric and @xmath436",
    ", the gauss and mean curvatures are given by @xmath437 where @xmath438 is the induced metric on the graph .",
    "it follows that the linearisations about the unit sphere with respect to infinitesimal changes @xmath439 are @xmath440 now the equation @xmath441 is solvable for @xmath91 exactly when @xmath442 for any @xmath443 spherical harmonic @xmath444 , and it follows that for generic metric variations @xmath115 , it is not possible to find a corresponding variation @xmath445 of the graph which preserves the condition @xmath446 .",
    "this instability of constant mean curvature foliations can be overcome if the background metric has positive adm mass @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the equation @xmath447 is solvable for @xmath445 for any metric variation @xmath115 , since @xmath448 for all @xmath444 satisfying @xmath449 and then @xmath450 is a conformal killing vector of @xmath352 and @xmath451 . thus at the linearised level it is always possible to preserve the condition @xmath452 .",
    "further evidence supporting the conjecture that qs foliations exist for generic metrics near a given qs metric satisfying @xmath424 comes from the thesis of spillane @xcite , which establishes existence in the axially symmetric case .",
    "however , the general case remains open , as does the related problem of finding a qs foliation of a null hypersurface @xcite .",
    "note that this _ foliation _ existence question is irrelevant for the _ metric _ existence question , which is resolved by the proof in @xcite of a large class of metrics in qs form .",
    "the momentum constraint equations are not yet well - understood in the parabolic method , although some results have been established @xcite . in the quasi - spherical case",
    ", we may introduce the parameterization @xmath453 where @xmath454 , @xmath455 , @xmath456 is the qs orthonormal coframe . in terms of the parameters",
    "@xmath457 , @xmath458 , @xmath459 , @xmath460 , the momentum constraint equations then take the form @xmath461 \\label{t0a }    8\\pi t_{0a } ru & = &             ( u\\eta_{ab})^{|b } + \\mu\\nabla_a u + \\nabla_a(u({\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\mu-\\tau ) )    \\\\      & & { } + r\\partial_r \\kappa_a -\\beta^b\\kappa_{a|b }             + ( ( 3-{\\mathrm{div}\\,}\\beta)\\delta_{ab}-\\beta_{b|a})\\kappa^b .                          \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matter fields @xmath462 are prescribed and ( [ t03 ] ) provides either an equation for @xmath223 , by choosing @xmath458 , or vice - versa , choosing @xmath223 and solving for @xmath458 .",
    "likewise , ( [ t0a ] ) can be regarded either as an equation for @xmath463 ( with the symmetric traceless 2-tensor @xmath457 arbitrarily prescribable ) or as an elliptic equation for @xmath341 with @xmath459 freely prescribable .    local existence in @xmath464 for the momentum constraints with prescribed @xmath465",
    "has been established by sharples @xcite , but it is not clear whether global results are possible without additional restrictions .",
    "much work still remains to be done on these systems .",
    "finally we note that a characteristic version of the quasi - spherical gauge , where a foliation of outgoing ( @xmath466 ) null hypersurfaces is assumed to admit a qs radial coordinate , has been described in @xcite . in this case",
    "there is no parabolic equation .",
    "the resulting hypersurface einstein equations are considerably simpler than those derived in the bondi gauge @xcite , and forms the basis for a 4th order numerical code @xcite , which heavily exploits the exact spherical geometry of the @xmath464-level surfaces .      the conformal method , the conformal thin sandwich method , and the quasi - spherical ansatz are all procedures for generating solutions of the einstein constraint equations from scratch .",
    "we now consider procedures for constructing new solutions of the constraints from existing solutions .",
    "we first discuss a procedure for gluing connected sums of solutions .",
    "the idea of this `` imp gluing '' @xcite is the following : say we have two solutions of the constraint equations , @xmath467 and @xmath468 .",

    "if so , we say that the sets of data admit imp gluing .",
    "imp gluing can be carried out for quite general sets of initial data .",
    "the sets can be asymptotically euclidean , asymptotically hyperbolic , specified on a closed manifold , or indeed anything else .",
    "the only condition the data sets must satisfy is that , in sufficiently small neighborhoods of each of the points at which the gluing is to be done , there do not exist nontrivial solutions @xmath180 to the equation @xmath483 , where @xmath484 is the linearization operator defined in ( [ dphi * ] ) ( with @xmath346 replacing @xmath178 ) . in @xcite it is shown that this condition is indeed generic .    the proof that imp gluing can be carried out to this degree of generality is detailed in @xcite , based on @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we note here two features of it .",
    "first , the proof is constructive , in the sense that it outlines a systematic , step - by - step mathematical procedure for doing the gluing : one conformally blows up the balls surrounding @xmath485 and @xmath486 to produce two half cylinders extending from the original initial data sets ; one joins the two half cylinders into a bridge , and splices together the data from each side using cutoff functions ; one uses the local constant mean curvature to decouple the constraints in the neighborhood of the bridge ; one uses tensor projection operators based on linear pde solutions to find a new conformal @xmath346 which solves the momentum constraint ; one solves the lichnerowicz equation ( the argument that this can be done , and that the solution is very close to 1 away from the bridge , relies on the invertiblity of the linearized equation and on a contraction mapping ) ; one recomposes the data as in ( [ recongammaa ] ) and ( [ reconka ] ) ; and finally one does a nonconformal data perturbation away from the bridge to return the data there to what it was before the gluing .",
    "this procedure can be largely carried out numerically , although we note that it requires us to solve elliptic equations on topologically nontrivial manifolds .",
    "the second feature we note regarding the proof is that it relies primarily on the conformal method , but it also uses a nonconformal deformation of the data at the end , to guarantee that the glued data is not just very close to the given data on regions away from the bridge , but is exactly equal to it .    while imp gluing is not the most efficient tool for studying the complete set of solutions of the constraints , it has already proven to be very useful for a number of applications , including the following :    1 .   _",
    "multi - black hole data sets : _ given an asymptotically euclidean solution of the constraints , imp gluing allows a sequence of flat space initial data sets to be glued to it . the bridges that result from this gluing each contain a minimal surface , and consequently an apparent horizon .",
    "with a bit of care @xcite , one can do this in such a way that indeed the apparent horizons are disjoint , and therefore likely to lead to independent black holes .",
    "_ adding a black hole to a cosmological spacetime : _ although there is no clear established definition for a black hole in a spatially compact solution of einstein s equations , one can glue an asymptotically euclidean solution of the constraints to a solution on a compact manifold , in such a way that there is an apparent horizon on the bridge .",
    "studying the nature of these solutions of the constraints , and their evolution , could be useful in trying to understand what one might mean by a black hole in a cosmological spacetime .",
    "adding a wormhole to your spacetime : _ while we have discussed imp gluing as a procedure which builds solutions of the constraints with a bridge connecting two points on different manifolds , it can also be used to build a solution with a bridge connecting a pair of points on the _ same _ manifold .",
    "this allows one to do the following : if one has a globally hyperbolic spacetime solution of einstein s equations , one can choose a cauchy surface for that solution , choose a pair of points on that cauchy surface , and glue the solution to itself via a bridge from one of these points to the other .",
    "if one now evolves this glued - together initial data into a spacetime , it will likely become singular very quickly because of the collapse of the bridge .",
    "until the singularity develops , however , the solution is essentially as it was before the gluing , with the addition of an effective wormhole .",
    "hence , this procedure can be used to glue a wormhole onto a generic spacetime solution .",
    "4 .   _ removing topological obstructions for constraint solutions : _ we know that every closed three dimensional manifold @xmath3 admits a solution of the vacuum constraint equations . to show this , we use the fact that @xmath3 always admits a metric @xmath487 of constant negative scalar curvature .",
    "one easily verifies that the data @xmath488 is a cmc solution . combining this result with imp gluing",
    ", one can show that for every closed @xmath3 , the manifold @xmath489 admits both an asymptotically euclidean and an asymptotically hyperbolic solution of the vacuum constraint equations .",

    ", @xcite showed that there is a large class of vacuum spacetime solutions of einstein s equations which admit complete null infinity regions of the form `` scri '' , as hypothesized by penrose .",
    "the tools developed by corvino and schoen have also been used to strengthen the imp gluing results @xcite .",
    "the corvino - schoen method aims to solve the constraint equations through a projection using the linearized operator @xmath498 and its adjoint @xmath499 .",

    "the arguments are essentially the same while the calculations are considerably simpler .",
    "we start with the observation that because @xmath503 has injective symbol , it satisfies an elliptic estimate on any domain @xmath401 , @xmath504 which importantly does not require any control on @xmath28 at the boundary @xmath400 .",
    "it follows easily that similar weighted estimates hold , with weight function @xmath505 which is positive in @xmath401 and vanishes to high order at @xmath506 : @xmath507 where the final term @xmath508 on the right can be removed if there are no killing vectors . with this assumption ,",
    "for all @xmath509 we can solve @xmath510 for @xmath511 , which in particular produces a solution to the linearized constraint equation @xmath512 .",

    "this implies that the linearized problem @xmath522 is solvable if and only if @xmath239 satisfies the four conditions @xmath523 , and the nonlinear problem @xmath517 is similarly obstructed for @xmath524 close to flat . by choosing the cutoff radius @xmath227 sufficiently large and rescaling back to @xmath525 produces exactly this close to flat situation",
    "however , it is possible to solve the projected problem @xmath526 with uniform estimates on @xmath527 .",
    "now the schwarzschild exterior metric can be characterised by the mass and centre of mass parameters @xmath528 , defined by @xmath529 some delicate estimates show that the map @xmath530 is continuous and has index @xmath531 , so there is a choice of parameters @xmath528 mapping to @xmath532 , which gives @xmath517 as required .",
    "the extension of these ideas , and the considerable details of the above arguments , are given in the original references @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount is known concerning the solutions of the einstein constraint equations . using the conformal method or the conformal thin sandwich method , we know how to construct constant mean curvature solutions which are asymptotically euclidean , asymptotically hyperbolic , or live on a closed manifold .",

    "we would like to know to what extent we can construct solutions with low regularity .",
    "and we would like to know which solutions on compact regions can be smoothly extended to either asymptotically euclidean or asymptotically hyperbolic solutions .",
    "besides these mathematical issues to resolve , there are important questions concerning solutions of the constraints and physical modeling . in view of the pressing need to model astrophysical events which produce detectable amounts of gravitational radiation ,",
    "one of the crucial questions we need to answer is how to systematically find solutions of the constraint equations which serve as physically realistic initial data sets for such astrophysical models . since these models are generally constructed numerically , an equally crucial question is the extent to which the constraint functions , initially zero , remain near zero as the spacetime is numerically evolved .",
    "it is not clear how close we are to resolving these mathematical and physical questions regarding the einstein constraint equations and their solutions .",
    "however , in view of the recent rapid progress that has been made in these studies , we are optimistic that many of them will be resolved soon as well .",
