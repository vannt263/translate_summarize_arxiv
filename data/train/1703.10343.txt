    "the poland - scheraga ( ps ) model @xcite played and still plays a central role in the analysis of dna denaturation ( or melting ) : double stranded dna _ melts _ into two single stranded dna polymer chains at high temperature .",
    "the success of the model is partly due to the fact that it is exactly solvable when the heterogeneous character of the dna is neglected .",
    "moreover , solvability has an interest on its own , from a more theoretical standpoint : phase transition and critical phenomena in the ps model are completely understood @xcite .",
    "however , the ps model is an oversimplification in many respects : it deals with two strands of equal length and it does not allow slippages of the two chains .",
    "these simplifications make the model one dimensional , and solvability becomes less surprising .",
    "what is instead surprising is that a natural generalization @xcite  called generalized poland - scheraga ( gps ) model  fully overcomes these limitations , retaining the solvable character in spite of the substantially richer variety of structures that it displays . in @xcite a mathematical approach to the gps model",
    "is developed and it is pointed out that it can be represented in terms of a two dimensional renewal process , much like the ps model can be represented in terms of a one dimensional renewal .",
    "the solvable character of both models is then directly related to their renewal structure .",
    "the growth in complexity from ps to gps models is nevertheless considerable : the key feature of ps and gps is the presence of a localization transition , corresponding to the passage from separated to bound strands , and for the gps there are three , not only one , types of localized trajectories ( or configurations ) .",
    "this has been first pointed out , at least in part , in @xcite , where one can find theoretical arguments ( based also on a bose - einstein condensation analogy ) and numerical evidence that _",
    " suggest that a temperature - driven conformational transition occurs before the melting transition \" _ @xcite . in this work",
    "we fully characterize the possible localized configurations .",
    "the transitions between different types of configurations have been already studied at the level of the free energy in @xcite where these phenomena have been mathematically identified and interpreted in a large deviations framework in terms of _ cramr _ and _ non - cramr _ strategies .",
    "this will be explained in detail below .",
    "here we content ourselves with pointing out that a full analysis of the cramr regimes is given in @xcite .",
    "however , the non - cramr regime , where the condensation phenomena happen , requires a a substantially finer analysis  moderate deviations and local limit estimates  at the level of the bivariate renewals .",
    "these estimates , to which much attention has been devoted in the literature in the one dimensional set - up ( see @xcite and references therein ) , are lacking to the best of our knowledge for higher dimensional renewals and they are not straightforward generalizations . they represent the technical core of this paper .",
    "we introduce the model in detail only from the renewal representation . the link with the original representation of the model",
    "is summed up in fig .",
    "[ fig : explain ] and its caption , and we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "we consider a persistent bivariate renewal process @xmath0 , that is a sequence of random variables such that @xmath1 , @xmath2 is iid and such that the inter - arrival law ",
    "i.e.  the law of @xmath3  , takes values in @xmath4 .",
    "we set @xmath5 with @xmath6 for some @xmath7 and some slowly varying function @xmath8 .",
    "moreover @xmath9 since we assumed the process to be persistent .",
    "we consider two versions of the model : constrained and free .",
    "the partition function of the constrained model , or _ constrained partition function _ , can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the binding energy , or pinning parameter .",
    "the partition function of the free model , or _ free partition function _ , is defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 for some @xmath14 and slowly varying function @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 just to prevent this constant from popping up in various formulas : this choice has the side effect of making clear that @xmath17 is not a probability .",
    "a configuration of the gps model , with one strand containing 23 bases and the other 14 , is represented in two fashions : the _ natural _ ( or polymer ) one and the renewal one . in particular",
    "we see that @xmath18 renewal increments ( or inter - arrivals ) correspond to bound base pairs and all other increments @xmath19 correspond to unbound regions in the bulk , that we call _ loops _",
    "( of total length @xmath20 , with length @xmath21 in the first strand and @xmath22 in the second strand ) .",
    "the term _ unbound _ is rather reserved to the terminal portion of the polymer : we refer the free ends as unbound strands . throughout this work ,",
    "a polymer trajectory is always given in the renewal representation : it is therefore just a point process in the plane . , title=\"fig:\",width=11 ] -.2 cm    in @xcite it is shown that for every @xmath23 and every @xmath24 @xmath25 which says that the free energy ( density ) of free and constrained models , with binding energy @xmath23 and strand length asymptotic ratio equal to @xmath26 , coincide .",
    "a number of basic properties of @xmath27 are easily established , notably that it is a convex non decreasing function , equal to zero for @xmath28 and positive for @xmath29 .",
    "this already establishes that @xmath30 is a critical point , in the sense that @xmath31 is not analytic at the origin .",
    "but @xcite is not limited to results on the free energy : associated to @xmath32 and @xmath33 there are two probability measures , that we denote respectively by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "they are point measures , like the renewal processes on which they are built .",
    "it is standard to see that @xmath36 ( which exists except possibly for countably many values of @xmath23 ) yields the @xmath37 limit of the expected density of points ( under @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) .",
    "hence for @xmath38 the density is zero , while for @xmath29 the density is positive .",
    "this tells us that we are stepping from a regime in which the two strands are essentially fully unbound to a regime in which they are tightly bound . in @xcite results",
    "go well beyond this : it is in particular proven that for @xmath38 the number of renewal points is @xmath39 and these points are all close to @xmath40 or @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : delocalized ] ) . in the polymer representation",
    ", this means that the two dna strands are completely unbound , except for a few contacts between the bases just close to the extremities .",
    "more precisely , it was found in @xcite that in the free case , if @xmath42 the two strands are free except for @xmath39 contacts close to the origin , and if @xmath43 the two free ends are of length @xmath39 and a large loop appears in the system , see fig  [ fig : delocalized ] .    on the other hand for @xmath29 the situation is radically different .",
    "this has has been analyzed in @xcite but only in the cramr regime .",
    "we are now going to discuss this in details .      a way to get",
    "a grip on what is going on for @xmath29 is to observe that we can make the elementary manipulation : for every non negative @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 since @xmath29 we identify a family , in fact a curve in @xmath47 , of values of @xmath48 such that @xmath49 and clearly defines a probability distribution that is an inter - arrival distribution for a new bivariate renewal process . at this point",
    "is not too difficult to get convinced that @xmath32 is equal to @xmath50 times the probability that this new renewal hits @xmath51 ( we call this probability _ target probability _ ) . if we are able to choose @xmath48 so that the logarithm of the target probability is @xmath52 , then of course @xmath53",
    "this can actually be done : it amounts to solving a variational problem and the uniqueness of the optimal @xmath48 follows by convexity arguments",
    ". however the solution may be qualitatively different for different values of @xmath23 :    1 .",
    "the optimal @xmath48 belong to @xmath54 , so both components of the inter - arrival law of the arising renewal have distributions that decay exponentially .",
    "we call this _ cramr regime _ because the tilt of the measure ( in both components ) is efficient in targeting the point @xmath51 to which we are aiming at ; 2 .",
    "either @xmath44 or @xmath45 is zero , so only one component of the arising inter - arrival law is exponentially tight . for the sake of conciseness we call this for",
    "now _ non - cramr regime _",
    "because the tilt of the measure ( in only one of the component ) is only partially successful in targeting the point @xmath41 . to be precise there is in reality a boundary region between the two regimes , and the notion of non - cramr regime will be made more precise just below  this regime is the main issue of this work ",
    "so we will not dwell further on this right now .",
    "a full treatment of the cramr regime is given in @xcite , and the results can be resumed as follows : all loops are small , in fact the largest is @xmath55 , and the unbound strands are of length @xmath39  see the leftmost case in fig  [ fig : localized ] .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the non - cramr regime and the reader who wants to have an anticipation on the results can have a look fig  [ fig : localized ] .      in order to make as explicit as possible for which values of @xmath29 the system is in the non - cramr regime ,",
    "let us define @xmath56 as the unique solution of @xmath57 this computation amounts to solving the variational problem we were after , in the case in which the problem is not solvable in @xmath54 and the optimal tilt of the measure involves only one of the two components .",
    "from one can extract a number of properties of @xmath58 : it is a real analytic , positive , convex and increasing function @xcite .",
    "we insist on the fact that , in spite of being defined for every @xmath29 , @xmath59 is not always equal to the free energy . more precisely in @xcite it is shown that @xmath60 if and only if @xmath61 , where @xmath62 we refer to @xcite for more details on the form of the function @xmath63 and the switching phenomena between the cramr and the non - cramr regime . in this work , and without loss of generality ( by symmetry )",
    ", we will consider only the case @xmath64 . to be precise",
    "we will rather consider the case @xmath65 because the phenomenology observed for @xmath64 , that is for @xmath66 for some @xmath67 persists also in a part of the window @xmath68 and we will analyze the model also in this window . in different terms : the analysis in the cramr regime is a large deviations analysis , but the whole non - cramr regime is equivalent from the large deviations viewpoint ( the issues there are about sharp deviations ) .",
    "so there is nt much conceptual difference between @xmath66 and @xmath69 , up to when @xmath70 grows too slowly , as we shall see .",
    "crucial for us is the probability distribution @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 which , as announced informally just above , allows to write the partition function as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the bivariate renewal process with inter - arrival distribution @xmath75 .",
    "next , we are going to have a closer look at this renewal process .",
    "let us write for conciseness @xmath76 ( a practice that we will pick up again in the proofs ) , and drop the dependence on @xmath23 in @xmath77 : @xmath78 . in view of",

    "we select a sequence @xmath95 satisfying @xmath96 so that @xmath97 gives the order of @xmath98 .",

    "let us also stress that the bivariate renewal process @xmath74 falls in the domain of attraction of an @xmath108 stable distribution ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we have , as @xmath109 , that @xmath110 converges in distribution to @xmath111 , a non - degenerate @xmath112-bivariate stable law .",

    "we stress that the constants @xmath134 depends only on @xmath136 and , for the interested reader , it can be made explicit by tracking the constants in and where the value of @xmath134 is used .",
    "this assumption is made to be sure that we lie in the so called _ big - jump domain _ , as studied for example in the one - dimensional setting in  @xcite : in our model it simply means that deviations  and the event we focus on is @xmath137  are realized by an atypical deviation on just one of the increment variables @xmath138 . as we shall , this happens just under the assumption for @xmath102 and this condition is optimal ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) .",
    "for the case @xmath139 the extra condition is not far from being optimal , but it is not : we discuss this point in appendix [ app2 ] , but we do not treat it in full generality because it is a technically demanding issue that leads far from our main purposes .",

    "a schematic sum - up of the correspondence of the the values of @xmath613 with the different regimes .",
