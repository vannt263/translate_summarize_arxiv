    "the goal of the ultra - relativistic nuclear collision program is the creation and study of a new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of the transverse momentum distribution in non - central heavy - ion collisions is thought to be sensitive to the properties of this state of matter .",
    "the second fourier coefficient of this anisotropy , @xmath4 , is called elliptic flow . for a recent review",
    "see  @xcite .    in ideal hydrodynamics",
    "@xmath0 is proportional to the spatial eccentricity with a magnitude which depends on the equation of state eos .",
    "this spatial eccentricity is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the spatial coordinates of the colliding nucleons in the plane perpendicular to the collision axis and where the brackets denote an average . in practice @xmath1",
    "is not a measured quantity but obtained from model calculations , using glauber or color glass condensate ( cgc ) models , for instance .    the ratio @xmath3 versus particle density is a sensitive gauge to test if the system approaches ideal hydrodynamic behavior  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that this ratio reaches the expected ideal hydrodynamic values only for the more central collisions at the highest rhic center of mass energy  @xcite which indicates that certainly for non - central collisions , as well as at lower energies , and away from mid - rapidity the elliptic flow contains significant non - ideal hydro contributions .",
    "much of this discrepancy can be explained by incorporating the viscous contribution from the hadronic phase  @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that also the hot and dense phase must deviate from an ideal hydrodynamic description .",
    "kovtun , son and starinets ( kss )  @xcite , showed that conformal field theories with gravity duals have a ratio of shear viscosity @xmath8 to entropy density @xmath9 of , in natural units , @xmath10 .",
    "they conjectured that this value is a lower bound for any relativistic thermal field theory .",
    "in addition , teaney  @xcite pointed out that very small shear viscosities , of the magnitude of the bound , would already lead to a significant reduction in the predicted elliptic flow .",
    "based on the centrality dependence of @xmath3 , the magnitude of @xmath2 for the created system has been estimated recently from a transport theory motivated calculation  @xcite and from viscous hydrodynamical calculations  @xcite .",
    "both approaches have their merits and drawbacks .    in these proceedings",
    "we explore how well a parameterization can be used to estimate @xmath2 as well as the ideal hydrodynamical limit of @xmath3 which is closely related to the eos .     versus transverse density of equation  [ parameterization1 ] for the same parameters as fig .",
    "[ fitexample ] . ]     versus transverse density of equation  [ parameterization1 ] for the same parameters as fig .",
    "[ fitexample ] . ]",
    "we use the parameterization from  @xcite which is defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transverse area of the collision region and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two free parameters in the fit .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 corresponds to the ideal hydro limit of @xmath3 and @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fitexample ] shows how the parameterization behaves for two different values of the ideal hydro limit ( the dashed line represents the harder eos ) and two different values of @xmath2 ( the full line represents the smaller @xmath2 ) .",
    "the effect of the eos is clearly seen in the magnitude of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fitexample ] and the value of @xmath2 is reflected by the change in this magnitude versus @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 the magnitude will be constant ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath2 is easier to quantify if one plots @xmath17 , as is done in fig .",
    "[ fitexamplenorm ] .",
    "a larger deviation from unity at fixed value of @xmath15 then indicates a larger @xmath2 .            to test",
    "if this simple parameterization does describe a state of the art viscous hydrodynamical calculation we fit the calculations from luzum and romatschke  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ compare_epsilon ] shows that eq .",
    "[ parameterization1 ] well describes results from viscous hydrodynamical calculations , done with three different values of @xmath2 and two different parameterizations of the spatial eccentricity ( glauber and cgc ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath0 is to good approximation proportional to the initial spatial eccentricity .",
    "in addition , it is seen that the deviation of @xmath3 from unity at a given @xmath15 increases for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ compare_theorist ] shows @xmath17 from viscous hydrodynamical calculations  @xcite done by different groups using the same set of values of @xmath2 but different parameterization of the eos and @xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is that used in the hydrodynamical calculations while the value of @xmath13 is obtained from the fit .",
    "we conclude that our parameterization yields curves that depend on the value of @xmath2 but are roughly independent of the eos and @xmath1 .",
    "however it turns out that if the eos is very different ( e.g. not incorporating a phase transition ) this scaling does break down ( not shown ) .            using eq .",
    "[ parameterization1 ] , we can now compare the various viscous hydrodynamical results with data and estimate the value of @xmath2 .",
    "since the value of @xmath1 is not known we take the eccentricity calculated assuming cgc  @xcite or glauber ( wounded nucleon ) initial conditions as two extremes .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ compare_data ] that , assuming the cgc initial conditions , the star data is well described with twice the kss bound , @xmath18 . using the glauber initial conditions , however , the star data is not described within the range of @xmath2 currently used by the viscous hydrodynamic calculations . from the deviation from unity",
    "one can estimate that the corresponding value of @xmath2 would be approximately four times the kss bound . using the cgc or glauber initial conditions we find for the ideal hydro limit of @xmath3 the value @xmath191 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "for the cgc initial conditions the value of @xmath13 approximately matches the eos used by luzum and romatschke  @xcite ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ v2viscous_hydrocgc ] where the centrality dependence of @xmath0  @xcite is well described by cgc initial conditions , a value of @xmath21 and @xmath18 .     from star as function of transverse momentum and centrality . ]     from star as function of transverse momentum and centrality . ]    using viscous hydrodynamics with these cgc initial conditions , eos , and magnitude of @xmath2 , the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath0 is also well described , as shown in fig .",
    "[ v2ptviscous_hydrocgc ] .",
    "the figure illustrates that the @xmath22 dependence is very sensitive to the viscous correction such that larger corrections decrease the magnitude of @xmath0 and shift its maximum to lower @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ v2pt_star ] shows the centrality dependence of @xmath23 where one clearly observes that the deviation with @xmath16 increases from central to peripheral collisions and that the peak position shifts to lower @xmath22 , consistent with larger viscous effects .",
    "we have shown that a simple parameterization can describe the centrality dependence of @xmath3 . when compared to viscous hydrodynamical calculations such a parameterization yields an estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the current rhic data is described well by a spatial eccentricity based on cgc initial conditions , a soft eos with @xmath24 and @xmath2 twice the kss bound .      c.  alt _ et al .",
