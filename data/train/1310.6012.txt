    "over the past century , researchers have devoted considerable effort into studying animal grouping behavior due to its important implications for social intelligence , collective cognition , and potential applications in engineering , artificial intelligence , and robotics  @xcite . indeed , grouping behaviors are pervasive across all forms of life .",
    "for example , european starlings ( _ sturnus vulgaris _ ) are known to form murmurations of millions of birds which perform awe - inspiring displays of coordinated movement  @xcite .",
    "western honeybees ( _ apis mellifera _ ) communicate the location of food and nest sites to other bees in their group via a complex dance language  @xcite . even relatively simple bacteria exhibit grouping behavior , such as _ escherichia coli _ forming biofilms which allow their group to survive in hostile environments  @xcite .    _ swarming _ is one example of grouping behavior , where animals coordinate their movement with conspecifics to maintain a cohesive group .",
    "although swarm - like groups could arise by chance , e.g. , little egrets ( _ egretta garzetta _ ) pursuing a common resource in water pools  @xcite , typically swarms are maintained via behavioral mechanisms that ensure group cohesion  @xcite . as with many traits",
    ", swarming behavior entails a variety of fitness costs , such as increased risk of predation and the requisite sharing of resources with the group  @xcite . with this fact in mind",
    ", significant effort has been dedicated to understanding the compensating benefits that grouping behavior provides  @xcite .",
    "many such benefits of grouping behavior have been proposed , for example , swarming may improve mating success  @xcite , increase foraging efficiency  @xcite , or enable the group to solve problems that would be impossible to solve individually  @xcite . furthermore , swarming behaviors are hypothesized to protect group members from predators in several ways .",
    "for example , swarming can improve group vigilance  @xcite , reduce the chance of being encountered by predators  @xcite , dilute an individual s risk of being attacked  @xcite , enable an active defense against predators  @xcite , or reduce predator attack efficiency by confusing the predator  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , many swarming animals take months or even years to produce offspring .",
    "these long generation times make it extremely difficult to experimentally determine which of the aforementioned benefits are sufficient to select for swarming behavior as an evolutionary response , let alone study the behaviors as they evolve  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a digital model of predator - prey coevolution to explore hamilton s selfish herd hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the selfish herd hypothesis states that prey in groups under attack from a predator will seek to place other prey in between themselves and the predator , thus maximizing their chance of survival . as a consequence of this selfish behavior , individuals continually move toward a central point in the group , which gives rise to the appearance of a cohesive swarm .    in our model ,",
    "both predators and prey have the ability to detect and interact with other agents in the environment .",
    "we evolve the agents with a genetic algorithm by preferentially selecting predators and prey based on how effective they are at consuming prey and surviving , respectively .",
    "forming a selfish herd is a possible solution for the prey to survive longer , but is not selected for directly . in this study , we first test whether a selfish herd evolves within a two - dimensional virtual environment with different forms of simulated predation .",
    "doing so enables us to experimentally control the specific modes of predation .",
    "we find that if predators are able to consistently attack the center of the group of prey , the selfish herd will not evolve . in subsequent experiments",
    ", we discover that density - dependent predation can provide a generalization of hamilton s original formulation of `` domains of danger . ''",
    "following these findings , we coevolve groups of predators and prey in a similar virtual environment to determine if coevolving predators impact the likelihood of the selfish herd to evolve .",
    "consequently , this study demonstrates that density - dependent predation provides a sufficient selective advantage for prey to evolve selfish herd behavior in response to predation by coevolving predators .",
    "finally , we analyze the evolved control algorithms of the swarming prey and identify simple , biologically - plausible agent - based algorithms that produce emergent swarming behavior .",
    "a preliminary investigation of the selfish herd hypothesis was presented at the genetic and evolutionary computation conference in 2013  @xcite .",
    "this paper expands on that work by studying the long - term evolutionary effects of differing attack modes , exploring a new attack mode that directly selects against selfish herd behavior , and providing an analysis of the control algorithms that evolved in the swarming prey .",
    "hamilton s original formulation of the selfish herd hypothesis introduced the concept of `` domains of danger '' ( dods , figure  [ fig : domains - of - danger ] ) , which served as a method to visualize the likelihood of a prey inside a group to be attacked by a predator  @xcite .",
    "prey on the edges of the group would have larger dods than prey on the inside of the group ; thus , prey on the edges of the group would be attacked more frequently . moreover , hamilton proposed that prey on the edges of the group would seek to reduce their dod by moving inside the group , thus placing other group members between themselves and the predator .",
    "further work has expanded on this hypothesis by adding a limited predator attack range  @xcite , investigating the effects of prey vigilance  @xcite , considering the initial spatial positioning of prey when the group is attacked  @xcite , and even confirming hamilton s predictions in biological systems  @xcite .",
    "additional studies have focused on the movement rules that prey in a selfish herd follow to minimize their dod  @xcite .",
    "this line of work began by demonstrating that the simple movement rules proposed by hamilton reduce predation for prey inside the group  @xcite , then opened some parameters of the movement rules to evolution in an attempt to discover a more biologically plausible set of movement rules  @xcite .",
    "finally , some studies have investigated the evolution of predator behavior in response to prey density  @xcite , the coevolution of predator and prey behavior in the presence of the predator confusion effect  @xcite , and elaborating upon the interaction between ecology and the evolution of grouping behavior  @xcite .",
    "this paper builds on this work by studying the effects of coevolving predators and predator attack mode ( i.e. , how predators select a prey in a group to attack ) on the evolution of the selfish herd .    more broadly ,",
    "in the past decade researchers have focused on the application of locally - interacting swarming agents to optimization problems , called particle swarm optimization ( pso )  @xcite .",
    "pso applications range from feature selection for classifiers  @xcite , to video processing  @xcite , to open vehicle routing  @xcite .",
    "a related technique within pso seeks to combine pso with coevolving `` predator '' and `` prey '' solutions to avoid local minima  @xcite .",
    "researchers have even sought to harness the collective problem solving power of swarming agents to design robust autonomous robotic swarms  @xcite .",
    "thus , elaborations on the foundations of animal grouping behavior has the potential to improve our ability to solve engineering problems .",
    "to study the evolution of the selfish herd , we developed an agent - based model in which agents interact in a continuous , toroidal virtual environment ( @xmath0 virtual meters ) , shown in figure  [ fig : sim - env ] . at the beginning of each simulation , we place 250 agents in the environment at uniformly random locations .",
    "these agents are treated as `` virtual prey . ''",
    "each agent is controlled by a _",
    "markov network _",
    "( mn ) , which is a probabilistic controller that makes movement decisions based on a combination of sensory input ( i.e. , vision ) and internal states ( i.e. , memory )  @xcite .",
    "we evolve the agent mns with a genetic algorithm ( ga )  @xcite under varying selection regimes , which will be described in more detail below .        during each simulation time step",
    ", all agents read information from their sensors and take action ( i.e. , move ) based on their effectors . in our first set of treatments , we simulate an ideal , disembodied predator by periodically removing prey agents from the environment and marking them as consumed , e.g. , when they are on the outermost edges of the group .",
    "subsequent treatments introduce an embodied , coevolving predator agent which is controlled by its own mn .",
    "the source code and data for these experiments are available online . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we describe the sensory - motor architecture of individual agents and present details related to the function and encoding of mns .",
    "limited - distance retina ( 200 virtual meters ) to observe their surroundings and detect the presence of other agents .",
    "the current heading of the agent is indicated by a bold arrow .",
    "each agent has its own markov network , which decides where to move next based off of a combination of sensory input and memory .",
    "the left and right actuators ( labeled `` l '' and `` r '' ) enable the agents to move forward , left , and right in discrete steps.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]      figure  [ fig : agent - illustration ] depicts the sensory - motor architecture of the agents used for this study .",
    "a prey agent can sense predators and conspecifics with a limited - distance ( 200 virtual meters ) , pixelated retina covering its entire 360@xmath1 visual field .",
    "its retina is split into 24 even slices , each covering an arc of 15@xmath1 , which is an abstraction of the broad , coarse visual systems often observed in grouping prey  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the number of agents present in a single retina slice , the prey agent only knows whether a conspecific or predator resides within that slice , but not how many . for example , in figure  [ fig : agent - illustration ] , the fourth retina slice to the right of the agent s heading ( labeled `` a '' ) has both the predator and prey sensors activated because there are two predator agents and a prey agent inside that slice .",
    "once provided with its sensory information , the prey agent chooses one of four discrete actions , as shown in table  [ table : agent - action - encoding ] .",
    "prey agents turn in 8@xmath1 increments and move 1 virtual meter each time step .    in our coevolution experiments ,",
    "the predator agents detect nearby prey agents and conspecifics using a limited - distance ( 200 virtual meters ) , pixelated retina covering its frontal 180@xmath1 that works just like the prey agent s retina ( figure  [ fig : agent - illustration ] ) .",
    "similar to the prey agents , predators make decisions about how to move next using their mn , as shown in table  [ table : agent - action - encoding ] , but move 3@xmath2 faster than the prey agents and turn correspondingly slower ( 6@xmath1 per simulation time step ) due to their higher speed .",
    "finally , if a predator agent moves within 5 virtual meters of a prey agent that is anywhere within its retina , the predator agent makes an attack attempt on the prey agent .",
    "if the attack attempt is successful , we remove the prey agent from the simulation and mark it as consumed .",
    "each agent is controlled by its own markov network ( mn ) , which is a probabilistic controller that makes decisions about how the agent interacts with the environment and other agents within that environment .",
    "since a mn is responsible for the control decisions of its agent , it can be thought of as an _ artificial brain _ for the agent it controls .",
    "every simulation time step , the mns receive input via sensors ( e.g. , visual retina ) , perform a computation on inputs and any hidden states ( i.e. , memory ) , then place the result of the computation into hidden or output states ( e.g. , actuators ) .",
    "we note that mn states are binary and only assume a value of 0 or 1 .",
    "when we evolve mns with a ga , mutations affect ( 1 ) which states the mn pays attention to as input , ( 2 ) which states the mn outputs the result of its computation to , and ( 3 ) the internal logic that converts the input into the corresponding output .",
    ".possible actions encoded by the agent s output .",
    "each output pair encodes a discrete action taken by the agent .",
    "the agent s mn changes the values stored in output states l and r to indicate the action it has decided to take in the next simulation time step .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : hdaa - treatments ]      thus far , we have explored attack modes that select for the evolution of swarming behavior .",
    "it is not surprising that there are also attack modes exhibited by natural predators that must select against swarming behavior in their prey .",
    "for example , blue whales ( _ balaenoptera musculus _ ) are known to dive into the densest areas in swarms of krill , consuming hundreds of thousands of krill in the middle of the swarm in a single attack  @xcite .",
    "we call this kind of attack mode a _ high - density area attack_. such an attack clearly selects against swarming behavior because it targets the prey that swarm the most .",
    "if krill swarms consistently experience these high - density area attacks , then why do they still evolve swarming behavior ?",
    "it is important to note that krill swarms are also fed on by smaller species , such as crabeater seals ( _ lobodon carcinophagus _ ) , that consistently attack the krill on the outside of the swarm  @xcite .",
    "thus , krill swarms are experiencing two forms of attack modes simultaneously : high - density area attacks from whales and outside attacks from crabeater seals .",
    "thus , it is possible that the selection pressure to swarm from outside attacks ( figure  [ fig : sdc - artificial - selection ] ) could outweigh the selection pressure to disperse from high - density area attacks .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : attack - modes]d , we model high - density area attacks as an artificial attack that always targets the prey at the most dense area of the swarm ( i.e. , highest @xmath3 ) .",
    "we note that this attack mode is the opposite of the density - dependent mechanism explored in the previous section , which favors predators that target prey in the _ least _ dense area of the swarm . once the target is selected , we execute the attack by removing the target prey and all other prey within 30 virtual meters of the target prey .",
    "outside attacks are modeled as described above . to study the effect of high - density area attacks on the evolution of swarming behavior , we allow the prey to evolve while experiencing both attack modes simultaneously .",
    "we vary the relative handling times of both attacks ( table  [ table : hdaa - treatments ] ) to explore whether relative attack frequency could explain why some swarming animals evolved swarming behavior despite the fact that they experience high - density area attacks .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sdc - artificial - selection - hdaa ] , prey experiencing only outside attacks quickly evolve cohesive swarming behavior ( light grey triangles with a full line ) .",
    "however , when we introduce infrequent high - density area attacks ( dark grey circles with a dashed line ) , the selection pressure for prey to swarm is reduced .",
    "finally , when we introduce frequent high - density area attacks ( black squares with a dotted line ) , the prey do not evolve swarming behavior at all .",
    "thus , one possible explanation for animals evolving swarming behavior despite experiencing high - density area attacks is that the high - density area attacks are too infrequent relative to other attack types to exert a strong enough selection pressure for prey to disperse .        in summary ,",
    "the artificial selection experiments provided us with two important pieces of information regarding the evolution of the selfish herd : ( 1 ) attacks on prey on the periphery of the herd exert a strong selection pressure for prey to swarm and ( 2 ) prey in less dense areas , such as those on the outside of the herd , must experience a higher predation rate than in areas of dense prey , such as found in the center of the herd .",
    "building upon the artificial selection experiments , we implemented density - dependent predation in a predator - prey coevolution experiment . adding predators into the simulation environment",
    "enables us to observe how embodied coevolving predators affect the evolution of the selfish herd .    for this experiment ,",
    "we coevolve a population of 100 predator genomes with a population of 100 prey genomes using a ga with settings described in table  [ table : ga - settings ] .",
    "specifically , we evaluate each predator genome against the entire prey genome population for 2,000 simulation time steps each generation . during evaluation",
    ", we place 4 clonal predator agents inside a @xmath4 virtual meters simulation environment with all 100 prey agents and allow the predator agents to make attack attempts on the prey agents . the prey genome population size , simulation environment area , and total number of ga generations",
    "were decreased in this experiment due to computational limitations imposed by predator - prey coevolution .",
    "we assigned the prey individual fitness values as in the previous experiments , and evaluated predator fitness according to the following equation :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the current simulation time step , @xmath7 is the total number of simulation time steps ( here , @xmath7 = 2,000 ) , @xmath8 is the starting group size ( here , @xmath8 = 100 ) , and @xmath9 is the number of prey alive at update @xmath6 .",
    "thus , predators are selected to consume more prey faster , and prey are selected to survive longer than other prey in the group .",
    "once all of the predator and prey genomes are assigned fitness values , we perform fitness proportionate selection on the populations via a moran process  @xcite , increment the generation counter , and repeat the evaluation process on the new populations until the final generation ( 1,200 ) is reached .",
    "to evaluate the coevolved predators and prey quantitatively , we obtained the line of descent ( lod ) for every replicate by tracing the ancestors of the most - fit prey mn in the final population until we reached the randomly - generated ancestral mn with which the starting population was seeded ( see  @xcite for an introduction to the concept of a lod in the context of digital evolution ) .",
    "we again characterized the prey grouping behavior by measuring the swarm density of the entire prey population every generation .",
    "figure  [ fig : sdc - pred - prey - coevolution ] depicts the prey behavior measurements for the coevolution experiments with density - dependent predation ( black circles with a dashed line ; mean swarm density at generation 1,200 @xmath10 two standard errors : 26.2@xmath102.3 ) and without density - dependent predation ( light grey triangles with a full line ; 3.9@xmath100.8 ) . without density - dependent predation ,",
    "the prey evolved purely dispersive behavior as a mechanism to escape the predators .",
    "however , with density - dependent predation , the prey evolved cohesive swarming behavior in response to attacks from the predators .    here",
    "we see that density - dependent predation provides a sufficient selective advantage for prey to evolve the selfish herd in response to predation by coevolving predators .",
    "accordingly , these results uphold hamilton s hypothesis that grouping behavior could evolve in animals purely due to selfish reasons , without the need for an explanation that involves the benefits to the whole group  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the discoveries in this work refine the selfish herd hypothesis by clarifying the effect that different attack modes have on the evolution of the selfish herd .",
    "now that we have evolved emergent swarming behavior in an agent - based model under several different treatments , we can analyze the resulting markov networks ( mns ) to gain a deeper understanding of the individual - based mechanisms underlying swarming behavior .",
    "for this analysis , we chose the most - abundant prey mn from each of the outside attack artificial selection experiment replicates , resulting in 100 mns that exhibit swarming behavior .",
    "first , we analyze the structure of the 100 mns by looking at the specific retina sensors that the mns evolved to connect to . shown in figure  [ fig : prey - brain - connectivity ] ,",
    "the prey mns show a strong bias for connecting to the prey - specific retina sensors in front of the prey , but not to the sides .",
    "additionally , some of the prey mns show a preference for connecting to the prey - specific retina sensors behind the prey . from this analysis alone",
    ", we can deduce that the retina sensors that are most conducive to swarming behavior are in front of the prey agent .        to understand how prey make movement decisions based on their sensory input , we map every possible input combination in the prey s retina to the corresponding movement decision that the prey made .",
    "due to the stochastic nature of markov networks , the prey agents do not always make the same movement decision when given the same input .",
    "thus , we take the most - likely output out of 1,000 trials as the representative decision for a given sensory input combination . effectively , this process produces a truth table that maps every possible sensory input to its corresponding movement decision .",
    "we input this truth table into the logic minimization software _ espresso _",
    "@xcite , which outputs the minimal representative logic of the truth table .",
    "this process results in a truth table that is reduced enough to make the evolved prey behavior comprehensible by humans",
    ".    surprisingly , the individual - based mechanisms underlying the emergent swarming behavior are remarkably simple .",
    "most of the prey mns evolved to make their movement decisions based off of only one prey sensor in front of the prey agent .",
    "if the prey sensor does not detect another prey agent , the agent repeatedly turns in one direction until it detects another prey agent in that sensor .",
    "once the agent detects another prey agent in the sensor , it moves forward until the agent is no longer visible .",
    "this mechanism alone proved sufficient to produce cohesive swarming behavior in the majority of our experiments .",
    "interestingly , this discovery corroborates the findings in earlier studies suggesting that complex swarming behavior can emerge from simple movement rules when applied over a population of locally - interacting agents  @xcite .    in a small subset of the evolved prey mns , we observe mns that occasionally connect to one of the prey sensors behind them .",
    "these mns watch for a prey agent to appear in a single prey sensor behind the agent and turn repeatedly in one direction until a prey agent is no longer visible in that sensor . once a prey agent is no longer visible in the back sensor , the mn moves forward or turns depending on the state of the frontal sensor .",
    "we note that this mechanism _ only _ evolved in prey mns that already exhibited swarming behavior using one of the frontal sensors , which suggests that this mechanism does not play a major role in swarming behavior .",
    "instead , this mechanism seems to cause the prey agent to turn toward the center of the swarm instead of swarming in a circle with the rest of the prey agents .",
    "this mechanism can be thought of as a `` selfish herd '' mechanism that attempts to selfishly move the agent toward the center of the swarm to avoid predation .",
    "the contributions of this work are as follows .",
    "first , we demonstrate hamilton s selfish herd hypothesis in a digital evolutionary model and highlight that it is the attack mode of the predator that critically determines the evolvability of selfish herd behavior .",
    "second , we show that density - dependent predation is sufficient for the selfish herd to evolve as long as the predators can not consistently attack prey in the center of the group . finally , we show that density - dependent predation is sufficient to evolve grouping behavior in prey as a response to predation by coevolving predators .",
    "consequently , future work exploring the evolution of the selfish herd in animals should not only consider the behavior of the prey in the group , but the attack mode of the predators as well .",
    "following these experiments , we analyze the evolved control algorithms of the swarming prey and identify simple , biologically - plausible agent - based algorithms that produce emergent swarming behavior .",
    "while this work shows one method by which the the evolution of grouping behavior can be studied , there remain many different hypotheses explaining the evolution of grouping behavior  @xcite . our future work in this area",
    "will focus on directly testing these hypotheses in similar digital evolutionary models .",
