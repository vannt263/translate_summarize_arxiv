    "all materials planned for space applications in which they will be exposed to the radiation in space have to be evaluated for their behavior under particle and uv radiation @xcite .",
    "it is known from many of these evaluation tests that particle and uv radiation can significantly degrade materials and , e.g. lead to changes in their mechanical behavior or thermo - optical properties @xcite .",
    "these changes can cause early failures of satellite components or even failures of complete space missions @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the design and performance of a radiation source that has been developed to simulate the short wavelength part of the vacuum - uv region of the solar spectrum during material tests .",
    "the solar uv radiation is generally defined as the solar radiation with wavelengths from @xmath11 nm to @xmath12 nm @xcite .",
    "the range between @xmath6 nm and @xmath12 nm is named near - uv ( nuv ) range .",
    "the other part of the solar uv radiation from @xmath11 nm to @xmath6 nm is denoted as the vacuum - uv ( vuv ) range .",
    "extraterrestrial intensity spectra of both ranges show that the contribution of the vuv radiation to the total intensity of solar uv irradiation is almost negligible ( fig .",
    "[ standard ] ) .",
    "the vuv - irradiation amounts to only @xmath13% of the nuv irradiation intensity .",
    "however , the vuv radiation can noticeably contribute to the degradation of materials despite of its small amount of total intensity .",
    "the energy of a single photon in the vuv range is considerably higher compared to a photon in the nuv range .",
    "vuv - photon energies vary from @xmath14 ev to @xmath15 ev whereas nuv - photon energies range only from @xmath8 ev to @xmath14 ev .",
    "therefore , vuv radiation can generate photoionization and photodissociation effects that can not be caused by the significantly lower photon energies in the nuv range .",
    "thus , degradation effects that would not occur under nuv irradiation even at very high intensities may be expected if the material is exposed to vuv irradiation for longer periods of time .        to get the most reliable information on uv degradation of materials in space by ground material tests",
    ", the uv - spectrum of the sun should be simulated as close as possible .",
    "the nuv spectral region can be simulated by using commercial short arc xenon lamps @xcite .",
    "the vuv spectral range is simulated with deuterium lamps in almost all material tests ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these lamps , however , feature a lower wavelength cut - off at approx .",
    "@xmath0 nm due to internal @xmath16- or @xmath17-windows which exhibit a strong decrease in transmission at this wavelength .",
    "this leads to the fact that the residual vuv wavelength range between @xmath11 nm and @xmath0 nm is generally not covered in up - to - date material tests although especially this range shows a strong increase of photon energies from @xmath11 ev to @xmath15 ev .    in context with the installation of the new complex irradiation facility ( cif ) for material testing at the german aerospace center ( dlr ) @xcite which should be capable of simulating the complete solar uv irradiation as well as proton and electron irradiation , the lack in the vuv simulation of the solar spectrum by currently available radiation sources necessitated the construction of a vuv simulator that covers the range from @xmath11 nm to at least @xmath0 nm . beside a good approximation to the real solar spectrum",
    "this simulator has to achieve several other requirements to make it useful for material testing : it has to exceed the radiation intensity of the sun ( at 1 au ) at the sample area of the cif in order to accelerate the degradation of the tested materials and to allow the simulation of long - term effects .",
    "furthermore , the simulator has to generate radiation that is emitted under a relatively large solid angle into the test chamber to permit the simultaneous irradiation of several samples with a homogenous intensity distribution .",
    "it must , moreover , be capable of working continuously during a sufficiently long period of time .",
    "the construction must take into account that the vuv simulator has to be connected to the test chamber without any window as no window material is known that completely transmits radiation in the concerned spectral range .",
    "therefore , the design has to ensure that no significant amount of particles of the medium necessary to generate the radiation can migrate inside the test chamber .",
    "below we describe in detail the design and performance of a vuv simulator that has been built with regard to the given requirements above .",
    "it bases on a design of a vuv gas - jet simulator that was constructed @xmath18 years ago by the institute of low temperature physics and engineering in kharkov , ukraine , in collaboration with the dlr @xcite .",
    "the calibration of the vuv simulator has been carried out in the range from @xmath1 nm to @xmath2 nm by the physikalisch technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) in berlin , germany .",
    "the calibration method and procedure is briefly explained in section [ calibration ] . the spectral distribution of radiation as well as the irradiance , the derived acceleration factors as well as the stability of the source are discussed and summarized in the ensuing sections [ spectra ] , [ acc ] and [ stability ] .",
    "the summary is given in section [ summary ] .",
    "the design of the vuv simulator is based on the semi - cryogenic version of the previous simulators which are described in @xcite .",
    "the radiation is produced by the transition of electrons belonging to excited gas atoms into their ground state .",
    "the gas atoms are excited by electron bombardment of a spatially limited supersonic gas jet which flows into a vacuum chamber .",
    "the vacuum is maintained by a combination of cryogenic and mechanical pumps ( semi - cryogenic design ) .",
    "a pressure of about @xmath10 mbar inside the jet is sufficient for an effective excitation . beyond the jet close to its boundary",
    "the gas pressure is several orders less ( @xmath19 mbar ) caused by the supersonic directional motion of the jet .",
    "this is the premise to locate an electron source in the close vicinity of the gas jet .",
    "this method generates electromagnetic radiation in a broad spectral range ( soft x - rays , vuv , nuv ) with relatively high intensities at lower wavelengths ( @xmath20 nm ) and permits a design without windows , which would disable the transmission in this range .",
    "the spectral intensity distribution of the radiation depends on the gas mixture , the flow rate of the jet , the electron current ( on the alignment between beam and jet , and the focus of the electron beam ) .        fig .",
    "[ vuv_1 ] illustrates the arrangement of the electron source and the gas jet inside the vacuum chamber of the simulator .",
    "the outlet of the generated vuv - light is realized behind the spot perpendicular to the figure s plane .",
    "the electrons which pass through the gas jet are caught by the collector at the opposite side of the source .",
    "the components of the vacuum system are better visible in fig .",
    "[ vuv_2 ] , whose plane is perpendicular to the plane of fig .",
    "[ vuv_1 ] .",
    "the gas jet is injected by a nozzle from top of the vuv - chamber into the vacuum .",
    "the flow rate is stabilized by a flow controller and is adjustable by software in the range between @xmath21 and @xmath22 sccm ( standard cubic centimeter per minute ) .",
    "the bulk of the gas load is pumped out through an intake port at the bottom of the chamber by a screw pump .",
    "the rest , which is a small fraction of about @xmath8% is removed by cryogenic condensation at two baffles .",
    "each of them is connected to one of the both stages of the cold head of a commercial cryogenic pump ( helium cooling machine ) .",
    "the @xmath23 stage reaches a bottom temperature of @xmath18 k without gas load .",
    "it increases to about @xmath24 k under gas load by formation of ice , which decreases the pumping power gradually and limits the operating time .",
    "the temperature is logged permanently as an indicator when a regeneration is necessary to remove the ice . during this process",
    "the cryogenic pump is turned off while the mechanical pumps continue their operation .",
    "the temperature inside the chamber increases and the residual gas , which is frozen on the cold baffles , is pumped out .",
    "the gas nozzle is thermally connected to a water circuit for tempering it to avoid a freeze .",
    "the combination of both pumping procedures is possible due to the effect that the gas inside the intake port banks itself .",
    "thereby , a reverse flow from the pipeline is impeded and the pressure regions are separated by @xmath19 mbar around the gas jet ( inside the chamber ) and more than @xmath25 mbar inside the pipeline",
    ".    a differential pumping segment is installed at the light outlet consisting of a turbomolecular pump and an aperture assembly .",
    "it improves the pressure conditions inside the radiation chamber and reduces the metal traces to the lowest possible limit .",
    "since tests can be performed in the chamber at pressures of @xmath26 mbar and less the pollution by metals over the test period is expected to be negligible .",
    "the fraction of light which is permitted to the test chamber is colored yellow in fig .",
    "[ vuv_2 ] .",
    "an opening angle of about @xmath27 is defined by the apertures in the cryogenic baffles and at the differential pumping segment .",
    "it ensures the irradiation of a target area with a diameter of @xmath28 mm at a distance of about @xmath29 mm from the spot , as it is realized in cif . to avoid that charged particles produced at the spot can reach the irradiated object , an electric filter is installed at the light outlet , which deflects them beyond the radiation flow .",
    "the axes of the gas jet , the electron beam and the light outlet are arranged out of square , while the orientation of the light outlet is horizontal .",
    "the axis of the gas jet is turned by @xmath30 to the vertical axis in the direction of the light outlet .",
    "the electron beam is inclined by @xmath30 to the horizontal axis but in its vertical plane it is perpendicular to the light outlet .",
    "the idea of this design is that the probability that particles could reach the radiation chamber or damage the cathode of the electron source is less than for a perpendicular arrangement .",
    "the electron source is realized as a pierce - type model with a magnetic lens behind the anode .",
    "the la@xmath31-cathode is heated up electrically by adjusting the cathode voltage depending on which emission current is needed .",
    "the electronic control unit of the source provides a pid algorithm which stabilizes the emission current by varying the wehnelt voltage automatically .",
    "the beam is focused by setting the current for the magnetic lens .",
    "two flanges are located at the opposite side of the light outlet .",
    "each is connected with a window for visual inspection of the luminous jet and with a radiation indicator compartment ( see fig .",
    "[ vuv_2 ] ) .",
    "the indicator measures the signal of the source .",
    "the digital value of the signal is visualized by the controlling software to monitor the stability of the radiation . during the calibration procedure for every measured spectrum",
    "the corresponding sensor value has been determined .",
    "[ spot_labels ] illustrates the size and intensity of the spot qualitatively with different settings for the emission current and for the gas flow .",
    "the photos were taken through the window at the opposite side of the light outlet ( see fig . [ vuv_2 ] ) .    based on the experience of the first design of the vuv simulator @xcite ,",
    "the same gas mixture has been chosen to produce the spectra .",
    "the mixture provides a continuum spectrum similar to the sun s spectrum . due to the presence of the water particles in the chamber the hydrogen lyman @xmath32 as well as",
    "the other h lines are present ( see figs .",
    "[ s1 ] and [ s2 ] ) .",
    "the intensity of the vuv light increases generally up to a saturation value with increasing gas flow .",
    "an increasing gas flow , however , reduces the quality of the vacuum in the radiation chamber .",
    "thus , the sensitive balance between vuv light intensity and vacuum quality has to be taken into account when optimizing the vuv source parameters . in the same way , a larger emission current causes , for a given gas flow , a higher intensity of the radiation .",
    "therefore it is favorable to operate the simulator with relatively small gas flows and high electron currents to get the same intensity .    after first function tests concerning the stability and operating life ,",
    "the following settings were chosen for the calibration procedure :    * gas mixture : ar ( @xmath33% ) , kr ( @xmath10% ) and he ( @xmath34% ) * electron energy : @xmath10 kev , * electron emission current : @xmath24 ma , * flow rate of the gas jet : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 sccm .    the goals for the calibration procedure were :    1 .   finding the optimal alignment between electron beam and gas jet , 2 .",
    "finding the magnetic lens current for an optimal focus of the electron beam , 3 .",
    "measurement of the spectral radiant intensity of the radiation .",
    "the vuv source was calibrated in the radiometry laboratory of the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) at berlin electron storage ring for synchrotron radiation of helmholtz zentrum berlin ( bessy ii ) in berlin - adlershof .",
    "ptb provides the calibration of radiation detectors and sources as well as the characterization of optical components in the uv and vuv range @xcite .",

    "the whole device can be rotated around the entrance axis to take the polarization of synchrotron radiation into account during that procedure .",
    "moreover , it is possible to shift the monochromator compartment via linear bearings perpendicular to the entrance axis in order to connect it with the light outlet of the source to be calibrated .",
    "the toroidal mirror ( see fig . [ ptb_calibration ] ) images the light spot into the entrance slit of the monochromator .",
    "the solid angle of accepted radiation is precisely defined by apertures ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ ptb_calibration ] ) . a spherical grating maps",
    "the entrance slit in the first spectral order into the exit slit , where the radiation of the selected wavelength is detected by a photomultiplier tube . the corresponding wavelength and",
    "the spectral resolution depend on the angular position of the grating , the grating constant , the slit width , and other parameters , which are optimized in order to suppress the influence of higher spectral order too .",
    "the measurement of the spectral radiant intensity is performed by varying the angle of the grating in different spectral ranges with a given resolution ( wavelength scan ) . additionally , it is possible to vary the angle of the toroidal mirror to measure the intensity at different horizontal and vertical positions at a fixed wavelength ( in combination with appropriate apertures and slits ) to record a spatial profile of the radiating spot and to align the image of the spot into the entrance slit of the monochromator .",
    "four monochromator configurations were used to calibrate the vuv - simulator in the following spectral ranges with given resolutions :    * @xmath1 nm to @xmath7 nm , resolution : @xmath38 nm , * @xmath39 nm to @xmath40 nm , resolution : @xmath38 nm , * @xmath41 nm to @xmath42 nm , resolution : @xmath10 nm , * @xmath35 nm to @xmath2 nm , resolution : @xmath10 nm .",
    "the first step for the calibration of the vuv - simulator was the alignment to the entrance axis of the monochromator and the connection of the vacuum systems of both facilities .",
    "after first wavelength scans in the range between @xmath39 nm and @xmath40 nm a relatively intense spectral line was chosen for the alignment of the electron beam to the gas jet .",
    "that means , the monochromator was adjusted to that intense wavelength ( e.g. @xmath43 nm ) and the orientation of the electron source and the gas nozzle were changed during the timely monitoring of the detector signal to find the optimum .",
    "the same procedure was performed for the setting of the magnetic lens current .",
    "after that , the wavelength scans were performed with the settings of the vuv - simulator described in section [ vuv ] in the spectral ranges given above .",

    "<S> this paper describes the construction and performance of a vuv - simulator that has been designed to study degradation of materials under space conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is part of the complex irradiation facility at dlr in bremen , germany , that has been built for testing of material under irradiation in the complete uv - range as well as under proton and electron irradiation . presently available uv - sources used for </S>",
    "<S> material tests do not allow the irradiation with wavelengths smaller than about @xmath0 nm where common deuterium lamps show an intensity cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> the vuv - simulator generates radiation by excitation of a gas - flow with an electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the radiation can be varied by manipulating the gas - flow and/or the electron beam .    </S>",
    "<S> the vuv simulator has been calibrated at three different gas - flow settings in the range from @xmath1 nm to @xmath2 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the calibration has been made by the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) in berlin . </S>",
    "<S> the measured spectra show total irradiance intensities from @xmath3 to @xmath4 mw@xmath5 ( see table [ tab : long ] ) in the vuv - range , i.e. for wavelengths smaller than @xmath6 nm . they exhibit a large number of spectral lines generated either by the gas - flow constituents or by metal atoms in the residual gas which come from metals used in the source construction . in the range from @xmath1 nm to @xmath7 nm where deuterium lamps are not usable , acceleration factors of @xmath8 to @xmath9 solar constants </S>",
    "<S> are reached depending on the gas - flow setting . </S>",
    "<S> the vuv - simulator allows studies of general degradation effects caused by photoionization and photodissociation as well as accelerated degradation tests by use of intensities that are significantly higher compared to that of the sun at @xmath10 au .    </S>",
