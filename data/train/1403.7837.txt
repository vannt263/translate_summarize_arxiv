    "the eigenfunctions of a single - particle hamiltonian with a large random potential are localized : they decay exponentially with the distance from some center . does the phenomenon of localization persist in a more realistic model with interacting particles ?",
    "this question was raised in anderson s original paper @xcite , and subsequent work in the physics literature @xcite supports the idea of many - body localization , on the basis of several theoretical perspectives and on numerical work .    in this paper we focus on one of the simplest models where many - body localization should occur .",
    "we consider the many - body spin chain hamiltonian on the lattice @xmath0\\cap \\mathbb{z}$ ] : @xmath1 this operates on the hilbert space @xmath2 , with pauli matrices @xmath3 operating on the @xmath4^th^ variable .",
    "variables outside of @xmath5 are frozen ( projected out ) , _ i.e. _ we set @xmath6 in ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) for @xmath7 for @xmath8 boundary conditions .",
    "note that @xmath9 is diagonal in the basis used above , except for the second term involving @xmath10 .",
    "we write @xmath11 with @xmath12 small , and assume @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are independent random variables , bounded by 1 , with probability densities bounded by a fixed constant @xmath16 .",
    "this model has random field , random transverse field , and random exchange interactions ; it is a variant of the model studied in @xcite .",
    "it should have a transition from a many - body - localized phase for small @xmath12 or @xmath17 to a thermalized phase if @xmath12 and @xmath17 are large .",
    "( note that a tensor product basis of eigenstates can easily be constructed for @xmath9 if either @xmath12 or @xmath17 is zero . )",
    "we investigate properties of general eigenstates , not just those at low energies .",
    "the notion of localization has to be adapted to the many - body context , for a couple of reasons .",
    "first , the configuration space includes the positions of all the particles ( or the values of all the spins ) .",
    "decay in this space is too much to ask for .",
    "second , whatever basis we choose for @xmath18 , interactions connect a given state to nearby states everywhere in space .",
    "this means that a normalized eigenfunction will lose its amplitude exponentially with the volume .",
    "we will examine three signs of many - body localization .",
    "first , for the above hamiltonian , the basis vectors are tensor products of @xmath19 or @xmath20 in each index .",
    "thus the basis vectors are indexed by `` spin configurations '' @xmath21 .",
    "we have weak off - diagonal disorder , and one might expect that the eigenfunctions resemble basis vectors , which would imply that for most eigenstates , the expectation of @xmath22 should be close to @xmath23 or @xmath24 . this is a basic signal of many - body localization for @xmath9 .",
    "the analogous statement for the one - body anderson model is the fact that most eigenfunctions have the preponderance of amplitude near a particular site .",
    "the second sign has to do with the product structure of @xmath18 .",
    "the hilbert space is a tensor product of local vector spaces ( instead of a direct sum , as in the single - body problem ) . in the absence of interactions",
    ", this structure carries over to the eigenstates . with weak interactions ,",
    "one should see the tensor product structure emerge at long distances . for small @xmath12 , and for any eigenstate",
    ", correlations between local operators separated by a distance @xmath25 should decay like @xmath26 for some @xmath27 .",
    "this is analogous to the exponential decay of eigenfunctions in the one - body problem , but it is a decay of entanglement , rather than amplitude .",
    "( distant spins are very nearly in a product state . )    as in the one - body anderson model , there should be a natural way to create a mapping between eigenstates and basis vectors , away from a dilute set of resonant regions .",
    "this is a third sign of many - body localization .    the second term of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) is the laplacian on the hypercube ; it implements spin flips or hops between basis vectors differing at a single site in @xmath28 .",
    "but a key difference between @xmath9 and the one - body anderson model is the random potential ",
    "here it consists of the first and third terms of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) .",
    "there is a lack of monotonicity , and in addition the number of random variables is only logarithmic in the dimension of @xmath18 .",
    "this creates particular challenges for rigorous work .",
    "the term @xmath29 is sufficient to break degeneracies associated with individual spin flips .",
    "however , we do not have full control over energy differences for configuration changes in extended regions , so an assumption about local eigenvalue statistics is a prerequisite for our results .",
    "our methods will apply to more general models provided they have a few key properties in common with ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) .",
    "specifically , there must be a tensor product basis in which the hamiltonian is a diagonal matrix plus a local perturbation , with all terms having random coefficients .",
    "( models with only some terms random , _",
    "e.g. _ ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) with @xmath30 , @xmath15 fixed , could be considered as well , but a stronger assumption about the behavior of eigenvalue differences would be needed . )",
    "the dimension of the state space at a site should be finite .",
    "the diagonal part should have local interactions ( _ e.g. _ nearest - neighbor as above ) , and the random variables at each site @xmath4 should be able to move energy differences between pairs of basis vectors that differ only at @xmath4 .",
    "thus one may consider certain models of interacting particles in @xmath28 with hard - core conditions .",
    "there is a considerable literature of rigorous work on the phenomenon of single - particle anderson localization , for example the proof of absence of diffusion in dimensions 2 or more @xcite and the proof of localization using the exponential decay of the average of a fractional moment of the green s function @xcite .",
    "the latter work also applies to hamiltonians on the bethe lattice , which is relevant for models of many - body localization involving decay in fock space along tree - like particle cascades @xcite . like the spin chain",
    ", the bethe lattice exhibits an exponential growth in the number of states as a function of the diameter of the system  this is a key problem for rigorous work on many - body localization .",
    "there are results for a fixed number of interacting particles @xcite .",
    "recent results on localization in many - body systems include a proof of an asymptotic form of localization ( in a non - random system with frustration ) @xcite and a proof of localization when the disorder strength diverges rapidly with the volume @xcite",
    ".      we will need to assume a property of limited level attraction for the hamiltonian in boxes of varying size :    ( limited level attraction ) consider the hamiltonian @xmath9 in a box @xmath5 with @xmath31 . with the given probability distribution for @xmath32 , its eigenvalues satisfy @xmath33 for all @xmath34 and all n.    we show that many - body localization holds ( in a sense made precise below ) for @xmath12 small enough , provided * lla(@xmath35 ) * holds for some fixed @xmath35 .",
    "ideally , one would prove many - body localization without making such an assumption .",
    "however , at this point we lack the tools to adequately deal with such questions of level statistics .",
    "nevertheless , * lla(@xmath35 ) * is a very mild assumption from the physical point of view , since random matrices normally have either neutral statistics ( @xmath36 , _",
    "e.g. _ poisson ) or repulsive ones ( @xmath37 , _ e.g. _ goe ) .",
    "indeed , the thermalized phase should have significant level repulsion @xcite .",
    "in fact , we only need ( [ ( 1.3 ) ] ) for a particular value of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a small power of @xmath12 ) . for the purposes of this paper , many - body localization ( mbl )",
    "consists of the following properties of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath9 :    a.   existence of a labeling system for eigenstates by spin / metaspin configurations , with metaspins needed only on a dilute collection of resonant blocks .",
    "( as mentioned above , the spin variables used to label basis vectors can also be used to label the exact eigenstates , but the correspondence becomes somewhat arbitrary in resonant regions , so we use the term `` metaspin '' instead . ) b.   faster - than - power - law decay of the probability of resonant blocks , which implies their diluteness .",
    "( this is critical to the whole concept of a labeling system  without it the labeling system would lose its meaning . ) c.   diagonalization of @xmath9 via a sequence of local rotations defined via convergent graphical expansions with exponential bounds .",
    "( locality means that graphs depend only on the random variables in their immediate vicinity . )",
    "d.   bounds establishing closeness of expectations of local observables in any eigenstate to their nave @xmath41 values , when observables are not in resonant regions .",
    "( this makes precise the idea that eigenstates resemble the basis vectors . ) e.   almost sure convergence of local energy differences and expectations of local observables as @xmath42 .",
    "f.   exponential decay of connected correlations @xmath43 in each eigenstate , except on a set of rapidly decaying probability .",
    "( this shows the exponential loss of entanglement with distance for the subsystems associated with the observables . ) g.   faster - than - power - law decay of averaged connected correlations .",
    "the set of resonant regions will be constructed through an inductive procedure that generates local rotations to successively diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "further details and concrete bounds will be deferred to the main body of the paper .",
    "however , we state here a theorem that incorporates ( iv ) , ( vi ) , and ( vii ) . it can be taken as a basic characterization of many - body localization .",
    "we will need a notion of state - averaging .",
    "let @xmath44 be a label for the eigenstates of @xmath9 .",
    "then let @xmath45 denote the average over the @xmath46 values of @xmath44 ( for a box of size @xmath47 )",
    ". the average can be with uniform weights ( infinite temperature ) or with any normalized energy - dependent weight function ( _ e.g. _ @xmath48 , which gives the usual ensemble for inverse temperature @xmath49 ) .    [ th1.1 ]",
    "let @xmath35 be fixed .",
    "there exists a @xmath50 such that for @xmath12 sufficiently small , * lla(@xmath35 ) * implies the following estimates .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the expectation in the eigenstate @xmath44",
    ". then @xmath52 furthermore , for any @xmath4 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 for some constant @xmath55",
    ". here @xmath56 , with @xmath57 any operator formed from products of @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 , for @xmath61 in a fixed neighborhood of @xmath4 .",
    "finally , @xmath62 all bounds are uniform in @xmath5 .    from ( [ ( 1.4 ) ] )",
    ", we can see that with high probability , most states have the property that the expectation of @xmath63 is close to @xmath23 or @xmath24 , as is the case for the basis vectors .",
    "this would contrast with a thermalized phase , wherein states resemble thermal ensembles ( a consequence of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "at infinite temperature , thermalization would imply that averages of eigenstate expectations of @xmath64 go to zero as @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "thus one sign of many - body localization is the violation of thermalization as in ( [ ( 1.4 ) ] ) .",
    "another sign of many - body localization would be the absence of transport .",
    "although we have not looked at time - dependent quantities , essentially all of the eigenstates we have constructed have a distribution of energy that is nonuniform in space ( _ i.e. _ in @xmath28 ) , and this necessarily persists for all time .",
    "so in a very basic sense , there is no transport in the system  this is another feature of the lack of thermalization .",
    "our rigorous result on many - body localization is an important capstone to the physical arguments that have led to the idea of a many - body localized phase . without full control of the approximations",
    "used , there remains the possibility that thermalization sets in at some very long length scale .",
    "such a scenario would not show up in the numerics , and has been conjectured to occur in the nonrandom model of @xcite .",
    "we will perform a complete diagonalization of the hamiltonian by successively eliminating low - order off - diagonal terms .",
    "the process runs on a sequence of length scales @xmath66 , and off - diagonal elements of order @xmath67 , @xmath68 will be eliminated in the @xmath69 step .",
    "the orthogonal rotations that accomplish this can be written as a convergent power series , provided nonresonant conditions are satisfied .",
    "resonant regions are diagonalized as blocks in quasi - degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "the crux of the method is control of probabilities of resonances",
    ". it will be critical to maintain bounds exponential in the length scale of the resonance .",
    "otherwise , the bounds will be overwhelmed by the exponential number of transitions that need to be tested for resonance .",
    "the method was developed in @xcite for the single - body anderson model .",
    "this led to a new proof of the exponential localization result of @xcite via multiscale analysis , working directly with rotations , instead of resolvents .",
    "( we recommend @xcite to serious readers of this article , as the key tools are developed in a much less complex setting . ) the key estimate that allows the procedure to work on all length scales is a uniform decay rate for a fractional moment for graphs with many independent energy denominators .",
    "this leads to exponential bounds on resonance probabilities , at least for graphs with mostly independent denominators .",
    "the method can be thought of as a kam or block jacobi @xcite procedure .",
    "each step is a similarity transformation implementing rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory in a manner very close to that of @xcite ( though in those works a single transformation was sufficient to break degeneracies in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "a number of authors have used related kam constructions to prove localization for quasiperiodic and deterministic potentials @xcite .",
    "more broadly , a number of different flows have been used to diagonalize matrices in various contexts @xcite .",
    "related renormalization group ideas have appeared in @xcite .",
    "the idea that quasi - local unitary transformations may be used to isolate local variables or conserved quantities in a many - body localized system appears in @xcite . here",
    ", we implement the rotations in a constructive manner , providing explicit expansions for the rotations along with bounds that quantify the notion of locality .",
    "such expansions are new , even in the single - body context @xcite .",
    "resonances occur when transitions induced by off - diagonal matrix elements produce an energy change that is smaller than some cutoff @xmath70 . in the spin chain ,",
    "a transition is a spin flip at a site @xmath4 .",
    "if we start from spin configuration @xmath71 , let the flipped spin configuration be @xmath72 : @xmath73 let @xmath74 denote the diagonal entry of @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath71 .",
    "( we take @xmath75 for @xmath76 . ) then @xmath77 we say that the site @xmath4 is resonant if @xmath78 for at least one choice of @xmath79 . the probability that @xmath4 is resonant is bounded by @xmath80 .",
    "we take @xmath70 to be a small power of the coupling constant for spin flips : @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 is resonant@xmath83 .",
    "then we may decompose @xmath84 into resonant blocks @xmath85 using nearest - neighbor connections .",
    "the probability that two sites @xmath86 lie in the same block is bounded by @xmath87 .",
    "( conditioning on @xmath88 , we obtain a product of independent probabilities for each site @xmath89 with @xmath90 ; @xmath16 is the bound assumed above on the probability densities and the factor of 4 accounts for choices of neighbor spins @xmath91 and @xmath92 . )",
    "let us group the off - diagonal terms of @xmath9 as follows :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 contains terms with @xmath95 , and @xmath96 contains terms in the nonresonant region .",
    "then define the antisymmetric basis - change generator @xmath97 with the local operator @xmath98 given by its matrix elements : @xmath99 all other matrix elements of @xmath98 are zero ; @xmath98 only connects spin configurations differing by a single flip at @xmath4 .",
    "nonresonance conditions ensure that all matrix elements of @xmath98 are bounded by @xmath100 .",
    "in fact , @xmath101 , since each row / column has a single term with that bound . also , @xmath102 .",
    "next , we define the basis change @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath104 be the diagonal part of @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath105 = -j^{(0)\\text{per}}$ ] , so that @xmath106 = -j^{(0)\\text{per } } + [ a , j^{(0)}]$ ] .",
    "this leads to a cancellation of the term @xmath96 in @xmath9 : @xmath107    note that @xmath108 and @xmath109 are given by a sum of local operators , so the commutators in @xmath110 likewise will be given as a sum of local operators ( although the range of the operator grows as @xmath47 , the order of the commutator ) .",
    "however , even though @xmath98 and @xmath111 only act on the @xmath4^th^ spin component , the matrix elements of @xmath98 depend on the spins at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "therefore @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115 $ ] do not in general vanish when @xmath116 .",
    "they do vanish when @xmath117 .",
    "we may give graphical expansions for @xmath110 by expanding each @xmath17 , @xmath108 in @xmath118 and @xmath119 as a sum of operators localized at individual sites .",
    "thus @xmath120 we must have dist@xmath121 ; otherwise the commutator with @xmath122 vanishes .",
    "note that the number of choices for @xmath123 , given @xmath124 , is no greater than @xmath125 .",
    "thus we have , in effect , a combinatoric factor @xmath126 which is controlled by the prefactors @xmath127 or @xmath128 , leaving only a factor @xmath129 .",
    "there are @xmath46 terms from writing out an @xmath130 order commutator , so the series is geometrically convergent",
    ". we may write @xmath131 where @xmath132 represents a walk in spin configuration space that is connected in the sense described above .",
    "more precisely , @xmath132 prescribes an ordered product of operators @xmath122 or @xmath133 arising from an admissible sequence @xmath134 after expanding the commutators ( admissible means each @xmath123 is with a distance 1 of @xmath135 , for a nonvanishing commutator ) .",
    "each operator implements a spin flip , hence we obtain a walk on the hamming cube @xmath136 .",
    "the interaction term @xmath137 is the product of the specified matrix elements and a factor @xmath138 from ( [ ( 2.7 ) ] ) , along with a sign and a binomial coefficient from expanding the commutators and gathering like terms .",
    "see @xcite , eq .",
    "a similar graphical expansion can be derived when the similarity transformation is applied to any local operator , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath139 , @xmath140 , or @xmath63 .",
    "nonresonant conditions imply that @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the number of operators @xmath143 in @xmath132 .",
    "as discussed above , the sum over @xmath132 involving a particular @xmath133 converges geometrically as @xmath144 .",
    "we need to diagonalize the hamiltonian within small blocks .",
    "an @xmath47-site resonant block has @xmath46 eigenstates . working with a sequence of length scales",
    "@xmath66 , with collars of width @xmath145 around blocks , we require the diameter to be @xmath146 for a block to be considered  small \" . for small blocks , factors @xmath147 or @xmath148 will beat the sum over states .",
    "we need to go further by requiring small blocks to be isolated , in the sense that a small block with @xmath47 sites in step @xmath149 is separated from other blocks on that scale ( and later scales ) by a distance @xmath150 when @xmath151 . here",
    "@xmath152 is a fixed integer to be chosen later ",
    "see the discussion following ( [ ( 4.8a ) ] ) . in the 1-body problem we use collars logarithmic in @xmath47 @xcite . here",
    ", we have to take collars linear in @xmath47 , which pushes us into a regime with extended separation conditions .",
    "the additional separation @xmath153 ensures that blocks do not clump together and ruin the exponential decay . in both cases the goal is to ensure that the combinatorics of graphical sums behave well in the multiscale analysis",
    ". the distance condition should be familiar to readers of @xcite .",
    "as in that work , the construction ensures that uniform exponential decay is preserved away from resonant regions .",
    "but this benefit comes at the cost of working with loosely connected resonant blocks with weak probability decay .    for step one ,",
    "small blocks are those with diameter 0 or 1 , since @xmath154 , and they have a separation distance @xmath155 from other blocks .",
    "they will be denoted @xmath156 .",
    "we add a 1-step collar neighborhood ( the set of sites at distance 1 from @xmath157 , and denote the result @xmath158 . the rest of @xmath84",
    "is given a 1-step collar to form @xmath159 .",
    "its components are denoted @xmath160 .",
    "we may also refer to @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "this enables us to identify the `` core '' resonant set that produced a large block @xmath163 .",
    "let us separate terms that are internal to the collared blocks @xmath164 and @xmath165 from the rest .",
    "the former are the troublesome ones ( resonance probabilities are hard to control , which leads to lack of control of the ad expansion ) , so they need to be `` diagonalized away . ''",
    "( compare with @xcite , eq .",
    "put @xmath166 where @xmath167 contains terms of @xmath168 whose graph is contained in a small block @xmath164 , and @xmath169 contains terms whose graph is contained in a large block @xmath165 .",
    "then @xmath170    the next step is to diagonalize @xmath171 within small blocks @xmath164 .",
    "let @xmath172 be the matrix that accomplishes this .",
    "it is a tensor product of matrices acting on the spin space for each small block ( and identity matrices for spins elsewhere ) .",
    "each block rotation affects only the spin variables internal to the block @xmath164 .",
    "let @xmath173 be a one - step neighborhood of @xmath164 .",
    "the rotation depends on the spins in @xmath174 and on the random variables in @xmath173 only .",
    "the procedure here may seem overly complicated ( after all , single site rotations could have been performed at the outset , simplifying the first step considerably ) .",
    "but we prefer to use a standard procedure so that the first step serves as a guide to later steps .",
    "the rotation produces a new effective hamiltonian @xmath175 where @xmath176 is diagonal , and @xmath177 note that @xmath169 is unaffected by the rotation .",
    "however , terms in @xmath178 that connect to small blocks are rotated .",
    "this necessitates an extension of the graph @xmath132 since transitions within a small block are produced . in effect",
    ", all the states in a small block can be thought of as a  metaspin \" taking @xmath179 values ( the same as the number of spin configurations in @xmath164 ) . because of the rotation , there is no canonical way of associating states with spin variables , so we will often use generic labels @xmath180 for block states . let @xmath181 label the set of terms obtained from the matrix product @xmath182 .",
    "thus @xmath181 specifies @xmath183 and we may write @xmath184 where @xmath185 since the matrix elements of @xmath172 for any block are bounded by 1 , we maintain the bound @xmath186 , where @xmath187 , the size of the graph ignoring the rotation steps . in the first step ,",
    "the rotation matrices are small ( 8 @xmath188 8) , so the spin sums implicit in ( [ ( 2.16 ) ] ) are controlled by the smallness of the couplings . as we proceed to later steps , we need to be sure that coupling terms are small enough to control sums over @xmath189 for larger rotation matrices .",
    "we are trying to prove estimates on expectations of local observables in eigenstates of @xmath9 .",
    "for example , we would like to compute the expectation @xmath190 in any eigenstate @xmath44 .",
    "we are trying to prove ( [ ( 1.4 ) ] ) , which can be written as @xmath191 ( recall that @xmath192 ) .",
    "however , at this stage of our analysis , we only have approximate eigenfunctions given by the columns of @xmath193 . as a warm - up exercise , then , let us prove the following result :    [ prop:2.1 ] let @xmath194 be sufficiently small .",
    "then @xmath195    as we proceed to better and better approximate eigenfunctions , this bound will become ( [ ( 2.17 ) ] ) .    _",
    "_ of course , @xmath64 is diagonalized in the @xmath71-basis , so @xmath196 , and ( [ ( 2.18 ) ] ) becomes @xmath197    our construction depends on the collection of resonant blocks @xmath198 ; let us call it @xmath199 .",
    "thus ( [ ( 2.19 ) ] ) is best understood by inserting a partition of unity @xmath200 under the expectation , where @xmath201 is an indicator for the event that the set of resonant blocks is @xmath199 .",
    "once this is done , we have two cases to consider : either 0 is in a resonant block , or it is not .",
    "if 0 is in a large block , there is actually no contribution because there is no rotation , so @xmath202 . if 0 is in a small block , we can expect substantial mixing , leading to an expectation for @xmath64 anywhere between -1 and 1 , for any @xmath44 .",
    "thus for an upper bound , we can replace the integrand of ( [ ( 2.19 ) ] ) with an indicator @xmath203 for the event that 0 lies in a small block .",
    "we have established that the probability that a site is resonant is bounded by @xmath204 . due to the collar , 0 need not be a resonant site , but if it is not , then one of its two neighbors is ; thus we get a bound of @xmath205 .    in the case where 0 is not in a resonant block ,",
    "we rotate @xmath64 : @xmath206 this expansion is very much like the one derived for @xmath110 ; in particular it represents the expectation as a sum of local graphs .",
    "note that the empty graph with @xmath207 does not contribute , because it has modulus 1 and so disappears in ( [ ( 2.19 ) ] ) .",
    "as we have seen , the sum over @xmath132 converges geometrically , so the norm of the matrix @xmath208 is bounded by @xmath209 .",
    "the rotation by @xmath172 can affect terms with @xmath132 reaching to a block , but the norm is preserved , so @xmath210 is likewise bounded by @xmath209 .",
    "thus the contribution from this case to ( [ ( 2.19 ) ] ) is @xmath209 , uniformly in @xmath211 ( provided the set of blocks @xmath211 does not contain 0 ) .",
    "this completes the proof of ( [ ( 2.19 ) ] ) , and hence also ( [ ( 2.18 ) ] ) .    it should be clear that a similar analysis can be performed to give an expansion for the approximate expectation of any local operator , such as products of spin operators @xmath212 , @xmath213 , or @xmath22 at collections of sites @xmath4 . if we consider the first - step connected correlation @xmath214 for operators localized at or near @xmath215 there will be a cancellation of terms except for graphs extending from @xmath4 to @xmath53 .",
    "if we insert an indicator for the event that no more than half the ground between @xmath4 and @xmath53 is covered by resonant blocks , we obtain exponential decay .",
    "the probability of half coverage of @xmath216 $ ] by resonant blocks likewise decays exponentially ( we will have to settle for weaker probability decay in later steps ) .",
    "thus we see that @xmath217",

    "these gap graphs result from expanding the difference between two denominators that arise from a commutator @xmath494 applied to an operator associated with @xmath495 .",
    "gap graphs are terms in expansions for the energies ( @xmath470 diagonal entries of the hamiltonian ) , and have the same structure as off - diagonal graphs .",

    "navely , the sum over @xmath498 could produce a factor @xmath499 , or @xmath500 in total .",

    "but then the @xmath128 is gone from the estimate .",
    "this is the reason @xmath440 was defined with no contribution from jump steps , which represent sums of long graphs .",
    "now let us consider the situation where @xmath411 is short .",
    "there can be very little overlap between the @xmath492  any overlap shortens @xmath503 , which must be at least @xmath504 .",
    "we claim that no more than @xmath505 graphs @xmath492 can fail to break new ground .",
    "( let us call them floating graphs . )",
    "the others are pinned to the left or right side of the growing graph , and do not produce factors of @xmath506  we call these pinned graphs .",
    "this means that short graphs can be controlled with a combinatoric factor @xmath507 . to check this claim ,",
    "consider first the case with no gaps .",
    "the ratio @xmath508 between the total length of the pinned graphs and the total length of the floating graphs must be at least 7:1 .",
    "the lengths of graphs vary by no more than a factor of @xmath509 .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath510 between the number of pinned graphs and the number of floating graphs must be at least 7:2 , which verifies in the claim in this case .",
    "if gaps are present , then ( as explained in section [ 4.3 ] ) the graphs bridging the gaps double back .",
    "this means that half the length of the bridging graphs is `` wasted , '' _",
    "i.e. _ it does not extend @xmath511 .",
    "consequently , the graph length available for floating graphs decreases as gaps increase , and the number of floating graphs is even less than @xmath505 . in detail , let us suppose that the length of the pinned graphs plus the length of the gap graphs is @xmath512 .",
    "then the condition for short graphs implies that the ratio @xmath513 must be at least 7:1 .",
    "hence @xmath514 . allowing as before a factor @xmath515 between the sizes of pinned and floating graphs ,",
    "we see that @xmath516 .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath517 is no greater than @xmath518 , which completes the proof of the claim .",
    "if we have a jump step @xmath445 , then the sum over substructure has already been taken care of in the inductive bound ( [ ( 4.2 ) ] ) .",
    "the sum over the jump itself is controlled with a combinatoric factor @xmath519 , which bounds the number of initial and final configurations for the jump .    to complete the bound",

    "we may control in a similar manner various other combinatoric factors bounded by @xmath527 when the subgraph @xmath411 has @xmath528 subgraphs .",
    "for example , the number of terms in @xmath529 , the choice of jump step or regular step , and the sum on @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , one needs to choose the denominators that will be differenced when forming gap graphs : the sums can be controlled by combinatoric factors @xmath527 for the subgraphs @xmath411 of @xmath407 .",
    "we need to establish some facts about comparability of the metric @xmath402 with @xmath530 .",
    "the issue is that graphs exhibit decay in @xmath402 ( blocks @xmath531 contracted to points ) but there are counting factors exponential in the size of blocks  specifically sums over states or metaspins in blocks @xmath429 and background spin configurations in @xmath532 .",
    "recall that blocks @xmath389 have size @xmath533 ; @xmath394 includes a collar of width @xmath397 in the metric @xmath534 ; and @xmath535 includes a second collar of width @xmath536 .",
    "comparability of the metrics will ensure that the size of @xmath389 increases by no more than a fixed factor , _ e.g. _ 8 , in forming @xmath535 .",
    "then the state - counting factor @xmath537 and the background - spin counting factor @xmath538 can be controlled by the smallness of the graph , @xmath539 , or its probability , @xmath540 . in some sense this is the crux of our method , because the maintenance of uniform exponential decay is essential for controlling state sums .",
    "separation distances that grow rapidly with block size ensure that the fraction of distance lost to blocks is summable , and so @xmath402 is always at least a positive fraction of @xmath530 .",
    "the construction is similar in spirit to that of @xcite .",
    "the separation rule is that blocks @xmath389 have diameter @xmath533 , and that pairs of blocks satisfy @xmath541 this type of rule can generate blocks with large , hierarchically organized gaps .",
    "but there is a limit to how spread - out blocks can be .",
    "consider a block @xmath389 with @xmath542 .",
    "if any gap in @xmath389 is greater than @xmath543 , then it would divide @xmath389 into two parts .",
    "at least one of the parts would have volume @xmath544 while being separated by a distance @xmath545 .",
    "this is impossible , because it would mean that part would have become a separate small block at some step @xmath546 .",
    "( the diameter of the part is obviously smaller than @xmath396 , since it is a subset of @xmath389 and diam@xmath547 . )",
    "the limit on gap size implies that @xmath548 the super - exponential growth of @xmath478 with @xmath549 implies that the ratios @xmath550 are small , and furthermore their sum on @xmath89 is small , for an appropriate choice of @xmath298 .",
    "this gives us the desired smallness of the fraction of distance occupied by blocks satisfying our separation conditions .",
    "now let us estimate the size of @xmath535 . note that a block @xmath389 has diameter in @xmath551 ,",

    ".    we will use a closely related estimate to handle a graph of size @xmath396 touching a block @xmath535 and/or blocks @xmath431 with @xmath410 .",
    "we have an exponential factor like @xmath540 to work with , but the decay can be spread out over the blocks as well as the graph , and we get at least @xmath562 of the original decay rate .",
    "this is how we handle state sums that occur in any graphical sum .",
    "similar issues arise in the single - body analysis of @xcite , but they were easier to handle because state sums were linear ( rather than exponential ) in the volume , so collars could be chosen logarithmic ( rather than linear ) in the volume of a block .      in order to estimate probabilities of resonant graphs , we will use the markov inequality , bounding the expectation of each graph to the @xmath563 power .",
    "each graph has a number of energy denominators produced at various scales .",
    "we need to work with a hierarchically organized structure of denominators .",
    "each denominator can be visualized as an arch over the collection of sites / blocks flipped in the associated subgraph .",
    "denominators from later steps arch over earlier ones .",
    "arches are either strictly contained in one another or else completely disjoint .",
    "this structure follows from the way denominators are introduced  see ( [ ( 3.10 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 4.7 ) ] ) .",
    "however , if two subgraphs have a site / block in common , the underlying random variables are identified , creating unwanted dependence , which shows up graphically as overlapping arches .",
    "therefore , we will need to require that as one proceeds up the hierarchy , there are no repeat visits , which means each new denominator introduces a new independent variable . as long as this is the case , there is no linear relation amongst the denominators , and they can be used as integration variables , provided we can bound the jacobian .",
    "( if there are repeat visits , then we will need to throw out some denominators  _ i.e. _ replace them with uniform bounds  in order to find a set that has the hierarchical property .",
    "the details of how this is done will be deferred to the next subsection . )    to leading order , each energy difference in the graph is a sum of energy differences of the sites / blocks of the graph .",
    "so we think of each site / block energy difference as an independent variable ( but no more than one variable for each site / block ) .",
    "for example , a flip at site 1 produces an energy difference @xmath564 .",
    "a flip at site 2 will produce an energy difference @xmath565 if compared to the previous configuration ; it produces @xmath566 if compared to the starting configuration . either way , the two denominators are independent .",
    "( here @xmath567 are @xmath287-independent constants coming from the exchange interaction @xmath568 . )",
    "if a third flip occurs at either site 1 or 2 , the new denominator will not be independent , because it can be written as a linear combination of the first two denominators .",
    "in general , any flip at a new site will introduce a denominator independent of the ones that come before , simply because it introduced a new independent variable : the energy difference at the new site .",
    "blocks will be treated as fat sites with metaspin variables .",
    "we allow for only one energy difference in the block to be considered independent ( otherwise we would need to assume probabilistic properties about multiple energy differences in blocks ) .",
    "so only steps to new sites / blocks introduce new variables that generate independent denominators .",
    "our assumed bounds on the distribution of energy differences allow us to integrate the @xmath563 power of each denominator in turn , keeping the unintegrated variables fixed .",
    "we are free to choose any set of independent denominators , even an incomplete ( non - spanning ) set .",
    "any remaining denominators , including all non - independent denominators , are bounded in sup norm .",
    "the above discussion applies to the leading order approximation for energies as a simple sum of contributions from sites / blocks .",
    "terms like @xmath569 do not depend on the random variables in the sites / blocks they connect , so they merely introduce constant shifts as in the example above .",
    "however , as we saw in the second step , energies @xmath570 receive perturbative contributions with @xmath571-dependent energy denominators . in the @xmath69 step , energies @xmath412 are updated to @xmath572 through perturbative terms and from the eigenvalues of newly formed small blocks .",
    "denominators in a graph for @xmath572 depend on @xmath573 for @xmath574 .",
    "we want to check the dependence on the underlying random variables by differentiating with respect to @xmath13 ( or with respect to other random variables at our disposal ) .",
    "we apply the chain rule repeatedly , down to the first scale if possible .",
    "but when a derivative hits a block energy at the scale of its formation , we stop and apply our basic assumption on non - criticality of those energies .",
    "the graphical expansions are well controlled , so it should not be a surprise that they can be differentiated , and the jacobian connecting a set of independent denominators of a graph to the underlying random variables is close to the noninteracting case .    _ behavior of block energies .",
    "_ block energy differences @xmath575 depend on random variables out to a distance @xmath576 from a block @xmath394 in @xmath556 .",

    "we illustrate with a simple one - site example , @xmath594 , with both @xmath595 random .",
    "the eigenvalue difference is @xmath596 in polar coordinates , and the radial derivative of the eigenvalue difference is 2 .",
    "of course , if @xmath12 is not allowed to vary , we would have a critical point at @xmath597 , where assumption * a1*(@xmath598 ) would fail .",
    "we should point out that there is some arbitrariness in the selection of @xmath180 in the blocks of the denominator graph .",
    "the denominators form a tree graph of energy denominators linking distinct spin configuration energies , since by construction each new denominator goes to a configuration with a new site / block flipped .",
    "the choice of how to order the denominators can affect the choice of @xmath180 in a block .",
    "intervening flips may cause a change in state in the block , so that a second denominator may reflect a different state change at a block .",
    "however , once a block variable is linked into the expanding denominator graph , it is treated as fixed , along with any other energy difference in the block ( we do not have enough information to treat other differences as independent . )",
    "subsequent denominators depend on new variables outside the block , so they are independent of previous ones .",
    "there is also some arbitrariness in the selection of variables when there are fewer denominators than sites / blocks being flipped . in such cases extra variables may be treated as fixed , all analysis done uniformly with respect to the values of the extra variables .",
    "it will be helpful to order the denominators in the graph @xmath407 as follows .",
    "first run through the denominators from the first step ( single spin flips ) . then proceed to denominators introduced in the second step ( graphs @xmath181 with two or three steps  the new denominator coming from an @xmath599 with @xmath600 differing by two or three flips .",
    "continue through all length scales up to @xmath53 .",
    "each denominator in the sequence introduces a new independent variable @xmath601 , and it is convenient to number the @xmath601 s in the same order as the denominators . let us introduce the notation @xmath602 for the denominator connecting @xmath71 to @xmath232 . the dependence on @xmath601",
    "is given by the leading term from scale 0 ( or from scale @xmath4 for energies of blocks @xmath429 ) plus corrections given by graphical expansions .",

    "we defer for a moment the discussion of block energy differences , and focus now on the perturbative terms .",
    "they obey bounds as in ( [ ( 4.6 ) ] ) .",
    "note that our ordering convention implies that the matrix @xmath610 is lower triangular , with @xmath604 s on the diagonal , and @xmath604 or @xmath591 below the diagonal .",
    "( here the pair @xmath600 runs over @xmath47 choices coming from the @xmath47 denominators , and @xmath404 runs over the @xmath47 independent variables . )",
    "thus to leading order , the eigenvalues of the jacobian are @xmath604 .",
    "our challenge now is to show the corrections are small .    applying the chain rule to ( [ ( 4.11 ) ] )",
    ", the derivatives flow to the denominator energies in each term @xmath611 or @xmath612 .",
    "we need to be cognizant of the fact that jump steps in @xmath411 are actually sums of ( long ) graphs , and these graphs have denominators which will depend on @xmath601 .",
    "so for the purposes of this discussion , we expand out every jump step at level @xmath410 into the sum of all its constituent graphs , see ( [ ( 3.11 ) ] ) or ( [ ( 4.28 ) ] ) .",
    "the grouping of graphs into jump steps is a convenient way to keep track of the way estimates from smaller scales merge with markov inequality bounds to produce bounds on longer scales .",
    "but when needed , we may go back to the underlying sum of graphs .",
    "another point to mention is the fact that the energy graphs @xmath411 do not have the  independent denominator \" property that we assume for @xmath407  it is not needed because we have inductive bounds on those graphs .",
    "when we apply the chain rule to ( [ ( 4.11 ) ] ) , we obtain a sum of terms with one of the denominators in @xmath411 duplicated ; the extra denominator can be bounded from below as in ( [ ( 4.8)]i ) , and the original graph is bounded as in ( [ ( 4.6 ) ] ) .",

    "the process stops when scale 1 or a block @xmath429 is reached , at which point",
    "the derivative produces a factor @xmath604 . repeatedly applying the bounds from the last section on graphical sums",
    ", we find that @xmath617 where @xmath618 is the set of sites / blocks where @xmath619 is the number of steps from @xmath404 to @xmath618 .",
    "let us return to the case of derivatives of block energy differences .",
    "when a derivative hits a block energy , it flows to the hamiltonian of the block and we have to take the expectation of the resulting operator .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by a leading term plus a graphical expansion with @xmath620-dependence in the denominators .",
    "we are only concerned with terms that depend on @xmath601 for @xmath404 outside the block .",
    "all the terms are bounded in norm as in ( [ ( 4.6 ) ] ) , so we can proceed to apply the chain rule as discussed above , and the resulting bounds serve to control the derivatives of block energies .",
    "as for the perturbative terms , we end up with decay from the block to @xmath404 for the derivative of a block energy with respect to @xmath601 , and ( [ ( 4.13 ) ] ) remains valid .",
    "the denominator @xmath621 is part of a graph that specifies a sequence of flips taking @xmath71 to @xmath232 .",
    "we write @xmath621 as a telescoping sum of energy differences for each spin flip : @xmath622 where @xmath623 is an energy difference as in ( [ ( 4.10a ) ] ) , arising from changing the spin at @xmath403 from its value in @xmath71 to its value in @xmath232 .",
    "note that @xmath623 depends on the spin configuration out to a distance @xmath624 , but we do not make the dependence explicit in the notation . of course , each @xmath623 is just a local difference of energies , so as a special case of ( [ ( 4.13 ) ] ) we have an estimate : @xmath625 now letting @xmath400 run over the @xmath47 sites / blocks with the independent variables , we may write the jacobian in matrix notation : @xmath626 . here",
    "@xmath627 is a modified identity matrix , with signs allowed .",
    "the matrix @xmath628 has small row and column sums , from the decay in ( [ ( 4.15 ) ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath629 .",
    "as @xmath628 can not move the eigenvalues of @xmath627 by more than that amount , we see that @xmath630 let @xmath631 be the matrix @xmath632 , which , as previously noted , is lower triangular .",
    "( but now , with the signs removed , it has @xmath633 s on the diagonal . )",
    "the matrix @xmath631 expresses the relation ( [ ( 4.14 ) ] ) between the denominators and the single flip energies @xmath623 .",
    "thus the full jacobian @xmath634 is @xmath635 , and its determinant is the same as @xmath636 , with the same bound ( [ ( 4.16 ) ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain the main result of this subsection :    [ prop:4.1 ] for a given @xmath598 , let @xmath192 be sufficiently small .",
    "assume * a1*(@xmath598 ) and inductive bounds ( [ ( 4.6 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 4.8)]i ) .",
    "then any system of @xmath47 hierarchically organized denominators obeys the following jacobian bound : @xmath637    note that the choice of normalization for the variables @xmath601 obscures the size of the lower bound ( [ ( 4.10 ) ] ) on the rate of variation of eigenvalue differences with the original variables .",
    "when estimating fractional moments of energy denominators , we will need to include factors @xmath638 when the block at @xmath404 has size @xmath639 .",
    "it turns out that the multi - denominator estimates of the next subsection can be organized so as to avoid working with block energy variables .",
    "those estimates are mainly about getting uniform exponential decay , and due to the diluteness of resonant blocks , the decay can be extracted from the spaces between blocks . nevertheless , the case @xmath640 of ( [ ( 4.16a ) ] ) is indispensable for controlling single - denominator resonances , in particular for block energies .",
    "the jacobian bounds allow us to estimate probabilities of resonant graphs .",
    "the arguments are based on similar estimates in the corresponding subsection of @xcite .",
    "first , let us consider case i of the resonant condition ( [ ( 4.8 ) ] ) .",
    "this is a single denominator estimate , so by ( [ ( 4.16a ) ] ) with @xmath640 , we see that the energy difference moves at close to unit speed with the variation of any one of the variables corresponding to flips of spins / metaspins in the transition @xmath641 .",
    "so the resonance probability is proportional to @xmath642 . in the case of a block variable for some @xmath429",
    ", there is also a factor of the area of the sphere of radius @xmath25 in @xmath643 , since there are up to @xmath644 random variables in @xmath431 .",
    "putting @xmath645 , we have that @xmath646 , and then the area is bounded by @xmath647 for some @xmath348 .",
    "also , the rescaling @xmath648 leads to a factor @xmath649 from ( [ ( 4.10 ) ] ) . as discussed in the section on graphical sums ,",
    "our constructions ensure that @xmath437 is always large enough so that exponentials in block sizes can be absorbed into the exponential decay in @xmath437 .",
    "thus the probability for condition ( [ ( 4.8)]i ) is bounded by @xmath650 , for some constant @xmath271 .",
    "next , let us consider probability bounds for case ii of ( [ ( 4.8 ) ] ) , which applies to short graphs with @xmath651 .",
    "consider the simplest case in which all the denominators in @xmath407 are independent .",
    "this will happen if there are no multiple visits to sites / blocks in @xmath407 , which means that each flip introduces a new independent variable .",
    "this means there are no erased subgraphs  those are introduced for the general case ( below ) to deal with repeat visits .",
    "( note that a variable for a block @xmath429 must be part of a graph that extends into @xmath431 , which we count as a repeat visit .",
    "so we do not have block variables in this example . )",
    "we claim that @xmath652 here @xmath653 is the denominator graph for @xmath654 , which is the same as the denominator graph of @xmath444 , plus the denominator for @xmath600  recall the definition ( [ ( 4.7 ) ] ) .",
    "the bound ( [ ( 4.16b ) ] ) arises from unwrapping the definitions .",
    "in particular , as explained after ( [ ( 4.7 ) ] ) , jump steps on scales @xmath655 are replaced by their upper bound @xmath446  this means that jump steps contribute their share of factors of @xmath12 .",
    "( these factors represent the improved bound @xmath656 , which is used in place of jump steps in @xmath657 , see ( [ ( 4.2 ) ] ) ) .",
    "but this is the only use of inductive bounds  the rest of the graph has all its subgraphs expanded out to the level of elementary flips . thus @xmath444 is obtained from the ad expansion ( [ ( 4.30 ) ] ) and the rotation ( [ ( 4.39 ) ] ) applied to @xmath658 . continuing down to the first level ,",
    "each spin flip comes with a factor of @xmath12 , as required in ( [ ( 4.16b ) ] ) .",
    "the factorials @xmath128 and @xmath659 from the ad expansion accumulate exactly as per the definition ( [ ( 4.3 ) ] )  including the lack of carry - forward at jump steps , which arises from the lack of factorials in the jump step bound @xmath446 .    applying the markov inequality to ( [ ( 4.16b ) ] ) , we obtain @xmath660 as in proposition [ prop:3.1 ] , we take @xmath661 . in the second inequality ,",
    "we have used the available factor @xmath662 from ( [ ( 4.16b ) ] ) ; after a partial cancellation it becomes @xmath663 in the denominator .",
    "we have chosen constants so as to equalize the factorials between both sides of the markov inequality . what remains are the denominators : the fact that their @xmath563-moments are bounded allows us to extract good decay of the probability with @xmath437 . the jacobian estimate ( [ ( 4.16a ) ] ) from the last section shows that we can effectively use the denominators as integration variables .",
    "we conclude that the moments are bounded by a factor exponential in @xmath437 .",
    "thus there is a constant @xmath271 such that @xmath664    next we consider the general argument for bounding the probability of ( [ ( 4.8)]ii ) .",
    "the idea is that sections of the graph where repeated sites / blocks occur have to be short  otherwise the graph can not reach far enough in @xmath28 to satisfy the condition @xmath665 .",
    "inductive bounds will be applied for sections of @xmath436 that overlap with each other . for such sections ,",
    "there is no gain in the markov inequality , and no decay as in ( [ ( 4.18 ) ] ) in the size of the subgraph .",
    "but we retain decay on a substantial fraction of @xmath436 , and so a bound similar to ( [ ( 4.18 ) ] ) can still be proven .",
    "let us review some basic facts about the structure of @xmath436 .",
    "it consists of a number of subgraphs @xmath666 , and each @xmath666 consists of subgraphs @xmath667 , and so on .",
    "( we can also have subgraphs two or more levels down . )",
    "jump steps are replaced with their bounds @xmath446 , as discussed after ( [ ( 4.7 ) ] ) , so they do not appear in these lists of subgraphs .",
    "thus we have a hierarchical , nested structure .",
    "a subgraph corresponding to an @xmath108 factor has an overall denominator ; subgraphs corresponding to @xmath17 factors have no overall denominators .",
    "any further @xmath108 subgraphs come with their own overall denominators .",
    "thus the denominators respect the hierarchical organization of @xmath436 .",
    "each denominator depends to leading order only on the variables within its associated subgraph . when there are no repeated sites , the hierarchical organization of denominators translates to the spatial structure of denominators ( and leads to the lower triangularity of the matrix @xmath631 of the previous subsection ) .",
    "for each subgraph , recall that @xmath668 denotes the smallest interval in @xmath28 covering all the sites or blocks @xmath426 with @xmath669 that contain flips of @xmath670 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath671 , then there is no dependence between the variables in @xmath672 and @xmath673 .",
    "any overlap between @xmath672 and @xmath673 will necessarily shorten the distance @xmath674 that @xmath436 can span .",
    "if we look at the entire interval @xmath453 , there will be a set of disjoint segments in @xmath28 where sites / blocks are covered more than once due to repeated flips of @xmath436 .",
    "we call these segments  looping segments , \" because the graph is looping back to previously visited sites",
    ". we can assume that any two looping segments @xmath675 have at least one site or block @xmath431 between that is not in a looping segment .",
    "let @xmath676 denote the size of a segment , where each site / block with @xmath47 visits is weighted by a factor @xmath677 .",
    "visits are counted by looking at the individual flips of @xmath436 ; any jump step counts as a visit to all the sites / blocks covered by the jump .",
    "note that some flips of @xmath436 can occur at places that are subsequently subsumed into a block ",
    "nevertheless all the flips inside such a block count as separate visits to the block .",
    "every time @xmath436 returns to a previously visited site / block , it fails to extend @xmath453 .",
    "hence @xmath678 is at least as large as the sum of the lengths @xmath676 of the looping segments .",
    "therefore , by the condition for short graphs ( [ ( 4.8)]ii ) , @xmath679    let us consider the denominator graph prior to the identification of variables in the looping segments ; each flip of @xmath436 is associated with an independent variable .",
    "all denominators are independent .",
    "this can be seen by observing inductively that the property holds for @xmath108 subgraphs ; @xmath17 subgraphs always have a free variable , which makes the overall denominator on the next scale independent .",
    "of course , a repeat visit to a looping segment forces us to identify variables of the flips with earlier variables , and independence is lost .",
    "however , denominators from a sufficiently long length scale do retain their independence .",
    "let @xmath680 , and let @xmath4 be such that @xmath681 . consider the denominator subgraph @xmath682 formed by links introduced at step @xmath4 and afterwards , with graph length in the range @xmath683 . as a subgraph of a graph with independent denominators , the denominators of @xmath682 are independent .",
    "furthermore , even after the identification of variables , the denominators in @xmath682 are independent .",
    "this is because each denominator covers at least @xmath522 variables , and since identifications occur within disjoint @xmath684 with @xmath685 , there will always be a free variable for each denominator .",
    "if there are @xmath47 visits to a site / block , then @xmath47 variables are identified there , and the site / block contributes @xmath677 to @xmath676 .",
    "hence no more than @xmath686 variables are lost in @xmath684 .",
    "( the worst case is when there are two visits per site / block of @xmath684 , which leads to a loss of two variables for each unit of @xmath676 . )",
    "once a denominator extends outside of @xmath684 , it spans an independent variable adjacent to @xmath684  by construction , there are gaps of size @xmath687 between the @xmath684 , and they contain only singly - visited sites / blocks . ) note that jump steps have no denominators , as they have been replaced with their upper bound .",
    "so jump steps do not produce any dependence between variables .",
    "we now describe the `` erasure '' procedure ; in particular we give an algorithm for determining the set of erased subgraphs .",
    "as we add denominators from the @xmath688 step and below , some will be internal to one of the looping segments ( _ i.e. _ , all the variables on which the denominator depends are in the looping segment ) .",
    "we will have to replace the corresponding @xmath108 s by uniform bounds @xmath689 from ( [ ( 4.2 ) ] ) .",
    "the denominator is effectively erased from the denominator graph , along with all denominators nested inside .",
    "there may be denominators on scale @xmath112 or above that connect @xmath684 to its complement .",
    "( again , we may visualize a denominator as an arch that encompasses all of its variables . ) in order to keep those denominators independent , we may need to drop ( _ i.e. _ erase ) a denominator on scale @xmath112 or below on either side of @xmath684 .",
    "this is so that a variable on either side of @xmath684 is freed up ( @xmath470 it is no longer used to integrate short denominators , so it is available for integrating long denominators . ) thus , when necessary , we choose a denominator that extends at least one step away from @xmath684 .",
    "it may start inside of @xmath684 or at the first site outside of @xmath684 . in order to free up the denominator on scale @xmath4",
    ", we need to erase a denominator that is directly subsidiary to it , @xmath470 up to scale @xmath112 .",
    "see figure [ erase ] .    .",
    "in this example , denominators @xmath690 are no longer independent once @xmath691 and @xmath692 are frozen .",
    "therefore , @xmath693 is dropped , along with subsidiary denominators @xmath694 .",
    "this frees up @xmath695 .",
    "then @xmath696 has an independent variable .",
    "[ erase ] ]    through this construction , we obtain a denominator graph @xmath697 , consisting of non - erased denominators on scales @xmath698 .",
    "all of the denominators are independent , even with the variables in @xmath684 s with @xmath699 frozen .",
    "we continue through shorter length scales , erasing denominators as needed to preserve independence after the freezing of variables in the @xmath684 .",
    "each looping segment with @xmath699 may have a collar of erased sections of width @xmath700 on each side . the looping segment",
    " spoils \" an interval of size no longer than @xmath701 .",
    "( one could do better with a more detailed analysis . ) recall that the total length of all the looping segments is no greater than @xmath702 .",
    "thus the total length of the  spoiled \" intervals where non - probabilistic bounds are employed is no greater than @xmath703 .",
    "this leaves at least @xmath704 of @xmath437 free of dependence issues , _",
    "i.e. _ with either independent denominators or jump steps .",
    "therefore , we will get a comparable number of factors of @xmath705 from the markov inequality .",
    "note that block variables are automatically eliminated with this procedure , because graphs traversing @xmath532 are treated as multiple visits to @xmath431 , which leads to erasures near the block .",
    "they can not be eliminated when estimating probabilities for case i of ( [ ( 4.8 ) ] ) . however",
    ", that is a single - denominator estimate , so the issue of correlation between denominators does not arise .",
    "we may now return to the probability bound as in ( [ ( 4.18 ) ] ) , only now any graph with @xmath706 is allowed .",
    "we claim that @xmath707 here @xmath708 is a modified factorial , which contains only the factorials in non - erased sections . as described above , the erased sections of @xmath407 contribute factors of @xmath709 instead of @xmath710 in the expectation . thus they match up with corresponding factors on the other side of the inequality @xmath711 .",
    "hence they contribute no smallness to the bound on the probability , and we are forced to make due with the modified factorial @xmath708 in ( [ ( 4.19 ) ] ) .",
    "but at least @xmath712 of @xmath436 is clear of dependence issues , so we are able to glean @xmath713 factors of @xmath705 in the markov inequality . recall that the graph @xmath436 is defined from @xmath407 by forgetting the order of subgraphs in erased sections .",
    "the order only affects denominators internal to erased sections ; the rest of the graph is unaffected , as it only involves the energies at the start and finish of erased sections .",
    "so in @xmath436 we sum over the usual graphical structures , but some subgraphs are specified as erased , which means any further collections of subgraphs are ordered from left to right .",
    "we do not need to worry about whether these graphs initial and final states match up properly .",
    "the point is to organize the event sum so that the erased factorials are not needed .",
    "the single event @xmath714 ensures that every @xmath715 is similarly bounded , for any @xmath407 that reduces to @xmath436 after the erasure procedure .",
    "so there is no point in defining separate events for each @xmath436 .",
    "note that sums over subgraphs in erased sections can be organized from left to right , so no factorials are needed to control them .",
    "( the leftmost point of any subgraph starts at a point within or immediately adjacent to the previous subgraph , so there is no factor that depends on the number of subgraphs in a collection . )",
    "this only works for event sums ; graphs such as @xmath715 depend on the ordering of all their subgraph collections , so in graphical expansions we retain that structure and the factorials that go with it .",
    "the markov inequality produces decay from integrating denominators only in non - erased sections of a graph .",
    "one might ask what is the purpose of carrying along the erased sections , whose contributions cancel out in ( [ ( 4.19 ) ] ) .",
    "the answer is that in order to control event sums , a graphical connection is needed between initial and final states of erased sections .",
    "then the complete sum over resonant events can be controlled  using only the decay from non - erased sections , which constitute at least @xmath704 of the length of the graph .",
    "note that the order of subgraphs in erased sections is not needed to construct a connection between initial and final state  any path will do .",
    "the following proposition gives the core result on the exponential decay of the connectivity function for the resonant blocks @xmath462 .",

    "other aspects of the sum over graphs were described in subsection [ 4.2.1 ] , in particular the fact that only ( 2/9)@xmath719-power factorials are needed to control sums over collections of subgraphs . as we just discussed , those factorials are not needed for erased sections , since we are now summing over coarser partitions of events based on @xmath436 , but still satisfying the bound ( [ ( 4.19 ) ] ) .",

    "the exponential decay of probability with @xmath47 is actually not needed  we could make do with probability decay similar to ( [ ( 4.24 ) ] ) , since that is what is used to control the diluteness of resonant blocks . but let us work with @xmath883 for simplicity .",
    "[ th5.1 ] fix @xmath884 and @xmath885 .",
    "let @xmath192 be sufficiently small .",
    "if @xmath883 holds , then mbl holds as well .    before proving this ,",
    "let us show how @xmath883 follows from the more standard statement on level statistics that appears on the introduction :    ( limited level attraction ) consider the hamiltonian @xmath9 in a box of size @xmath47 .",
    "its eigenvalues satisfy @xmath886 for all @xmath887 and all @xmath888    clearly , we may take @xmath889 in ( [ ( 5.2 ) ] ) and then @xmath890 holds for any @xmath891 , provided @xmath892 is small enough ( depending only on @xmath893 ) .",
    "thus we have    [ co5.2 ] let @xmath35 be fixed , and let @xmath12 be sufficiently small .",
    "assume * * lla**@xmath319",
    ". then mbl holds .",
    "as explained earlier , we can handle level statistics that are neutral ( like poisson , @xmath36 ) , or repulsive ( @xmath894 as for goe ) , and we can handle values of @xmath782 smaller than 1 , which correspond to level attraction .",
    "thus we obtain mbl , provided there is a bound uniform in @xmath47 on the level attraction exponent @xmath782 .",
    "note that , speaking broadly , level statistics are expected to be repulsive or neutral .",
    "however , we are not aware of any general result of that type",
    ".    _ proof of theorem [ th5.1 ] .",
    "_ we need to verify @xmath879 on a set of sufficiently high probability .",
    "the idea is to compare the energy differences of @xmath895 that are associated with the block @xmath394 with those of another hamiltonian @xmath896 in the volume @xmath897 .",
    "( recall that @xmath535 is @xmath394 plus an additional collar of width @xmath898 , measured as usual in the metric @xmath556 . )",
    "this allows for the maximum range of dependence in the @xmath394 eigenvalues ( through energies @xmath899 in @xmath900 ) . here",
    "@xmath896 is the original hamiltonian in @xmath5 , restricted to @xmath535 , which means that spins outside of @xmath535 are fixed at @xmath23 ( as are the spins in @xmath901 ) .",
    "as in our discussion on volume - dependence in section [ 4.5 ] , we may define resonant graphs and blocks by including every possible configuration of spins and of @xmath5 within the relevant range .",
    "therefore , the set of resonant blocks @xmath394 does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "let us assume that in @xmath535 , the eigenvalues of @xmath896 satisfy @xmath902 where @xmath47 is the number of sites in @xmath394 , and @xmath903 is a small constant to be chosen below .",
    "note that the size of @xmath535 is no greater than some multiple @xmath89 of @xmath47 , after allowing for the expansion of distance due to blocks at lower scales .",
    "so if we let @xmath904 and take @xmath905 , then @xmath906 implies that ( [ ( 5.2a ) ] ) occurs with probability at least @xmath907",
    ". we will discuss below the case where ( [ ( 5.2a ) ] ) does not hold .",
    "we may perform all our expansions on @xmath896 in @xmath897 .",
    "we obtain block energies @xmath908 .",
    "these agree with the corresponding energies @xmath909 obtained from the expansion in @xmath5 , because as explained earlier , the range of dependence on @xmath71 is less than the width of the collar @xmath910 . furthermore , all remaining terms in @xmath911(the hamiltonian @xmath896 after the @xmath53^th^ step ) are of order @xmath912 , so by ( [ ( 4.6 ) ] ) they are exponentially small  in total no greater in norm than @xmath913 .",
    "( note that separation conditions keep other blocks @xmath394 or @xmath914 out of @xmath535 .",
    "the size of @xmath394 is no greater than @xmath915 , from the collar of width @xmath397 about @xmath389 , plus some additional expansion from smaller blocks . )",
    "thus the minimum eigenvalue spacing in ( [ ( 5.2a ) ] ) transfers to @xmath908 and hence to @xmath909 .",
    "( since @xmath766 , the corrections are much smaller than the minimum gap . ) at the heart of our method is a way to extract local  quasi - mode \" energies for transitions approximated on a length scale @xmath631 , with errors exponentially small in @xmath631 .",
    "rotations were performed for graphs connecting @xmath394 to its complement , up to scale @xmath396 , so any residual effects are exponentially small .    in order to obtain assumption",
    "@xmath879 we need to compare derivatives of @xmath908 with those of @xmath916 . since we are making a perturbation with exponentially small norm and derivatives , bounds on derivatives of @xmath916 carry over to those of @xmath917 via second order perturbation theory",
    ". there will be a sum over intermediate states ( no more than exponential in @xmath47 ) and an energy denominator ( bounded below by ( [ ( 5.2a ) ] ) ) .",
    "thus derivatives of @xmath909 ( or more precisely of differences @xmath575 ) agree with those of @xmath916 up to errors of order @xmath918 .",
    "next we use ( [ ( 5.2a ) ] ) to prove a lower bound on the radial derivative of @xmath919 .",
    "note that the radial variable @xmath25 appears as a multiplicative factor in @xmath896 , since all couplings @xmath920 are proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "therefore energies ( and their differences ) are strictly proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "let us fix the angular variables .",
    "then there is some @xmath921 such that the minimum eigenvalue separation is @xmath922 .",
    "any eigenvalue difference can be written as @xmath923 therefore , @xmath924 where we use the radius of the integration domain @xmath925^{mn}$ ] to bound @xmath921 from above .",
    "( a larger value of @xmath921 would mean ( [ ( 5.2a ) ] ) fails throughout the integration domain on the ray we are considering , in which case there is nothing to prove . )",
    "thus we obtain @xmath926 since as explained above , the derivatives of @xmath909 agree with these of @xmath927 up to terms much smaller than @xmath922 .",
    "note that ( [ ( 5.4 ) ] ) compares with ( [ ( 4.10 ) ] ) of assumption @xmath879 , with @xmath928 .",
    "each time we do a denominator integral in proving an estimate like ( [ ( 4.19 ) ] ) , we pick up a factor of @xmath598 , which through ( [ ( 4.10 ) ] ) controls the rate of change of energy differences .",
    "so now that @xmath928 , we need to absorb factors of @xmath929 into ( [ ( 4.19 ) ] ) .",
    "each denominator integral yields a factor @xmath930 in ( [ ( 4.19 ) ] ) , and so a factor of @xmath931 can be handled with a reduction of the power from @xmath932 to @xmath933 , for some small value of @xmath903 .",
    "there are also factors @xmath934 for blocks of size @xmath47 .",
    "again , these can be absorbed with the reduction in power from @xmath932 to @xmath933 because the graph size @xmath438 is always comparable in size ( or longer than ) the sum of its block sizes .",
    "thus our estimates work with only this minor modification .",
    "it remains for us to discuss the case where ( [ ( 5.2a ) ] ) does not hold , an event whose probability is no greater than @xmath935 .",
    "we may consider any block @xmath535 with a too - small level spacing as part of @xmath479 , the next singular region .",
    "its probability is exponentially small in the size of @xmath535 , so we obtain a bound similar to ( [ ( 4.20 ) ] ) : @xmath936 the rate of decay is @xmath937 instead of @xmath705 , but as long as @xmath70 is chosen sufficiently small , the proof of diluteness of resonant blocks works as before .",
    "( diluteness is the bound ( [ ( 4.24 ) ] ) giving rapid falloff of the probability that @xmath558 belong to the same resonant block .",
    "it should be clear that the smaller power of @xmath766 just means that the value of @xmath938 that can be achieved in theorem [ th1.1 ] is a bit smaller than what we obtained by assuming @xmath879 . )",
    "the proof relies on bounds like ( [ ( 4.20 ) ] ) , which provide a probability factor @xmath705 for each site of @xmath464",
    ". then separation conditions tied to the volume control the sum over admissible @xmath464 and provide a minimum volume for a given diameter .",
    "all this would work if we defined the volume of a block @xmath535 of size @xmath47 as @xmath939 , the same as the minimum volume achievable from sites of @xmath479 via the original construction .",
    "this makes it clear that we could make do with a weaker form of @xmath940 , replacing ( [ ( 5.1 ) ] ) with @xmath941 for some constant @xmath942 .",
    "( this could potentially be useful if , in the future , better methods are developed to control minimum level spacings . ) the basic mechanism at play here is that by borel - cantelli , ( [ ( 5.5 ) ] ) guarantees that there is some scale @xmath149 at which the minimum level spacing holds .",
    "when that happens , we obtain the needed variation of @xmath943 with @xmath25 , and the rest of the proof of mbl works as described in chapter [ 4 ] .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ th5.1 ] .",
    "corollary [ co5.2 ] then gives the full version of theorem [ th1.1 ] .",
    "here we describe how to organize the graphical expansions of section [ 4.3 ] to exhibit decay across gaps between graphs while limiting the duplication of denominators .",
    "consider the general expression for a term in @xmath771 : @xmath944 divide the @xmath945 into non - overlapping groups .",
    "the actions of a commutator of a graph in one group with a graph in another group is simple , as the operators in question involve disjoint sets of spin indices . as indicated in ( [ ( 4.35 ) ] ) ,",
    "the energy denominators are computed before and after a spin transition and the difference taken .",
    "we have the freedom to use either side of ( [ ( 4.35 ) ] ) when working with these denominator differences .",
    "we use the right - hand side of ( [ ( 4.35 ) ] ) and the graphical expansion ( [ ( 4.36 ) ] ) only for a minimal set of differences , sufficient to close the gaps between groups . for the remaining differences",
    ", we bound each term on the left - hand side of ( [ ( 4.35 ) ] ) separately : @xmath89 differences result in @xmath946 terms ; a factor of 2 per graph is easily controlled , as discussed in subsection [ 4.2.1 ] .",
    "we use the following algorithm to generate differences and select ones that need to be expanded as in ( [ ( 4.36 ) ] ) .",
    "we proceed through the sequence of graphs @xmath947 in ( [ ( a.1 ) ] ) and the associated commutators .",
    "if a graph @xmath945 appears as the first representative of one of the groups , the associated commutator is written as a sum of terms involving the commutators with each of the previous graphs @xmath948 , by leibniz s rule for commutators .",
    "as @xmath945 is the first in its group , there is no overlap between it and the previous graphs .",
    "then , as was just explained , the commutator can be written as the sum of two differences .",
    "for example , one contains the effect of @xmath949 on @xmath950 and the other contains the effect of @xmath950 on @xmath949 .",
    "this may be indicated graphically with a line from one graph to the other and an arrow indicating the direction of the effect .",
    "( the arrow can go in either direction , because each graph s denominators are affected by changes in spin configuration induced by the other graph .",
    "however , the direction of the arrow is unimportant in what follows , as either direction will be sufficient to create a graphical connection across the gap between the graphs . )",
    "note that the expanding set of lines ensures that each group is connected to its predecessors as soon as one of its graphs appears .",
    "hence when all commutators have been performed , the graph of difference lines ( the _ difference graph _ ) connects all of the groups .",
    "many of the lines are redundant , however .",
    "we define a minimal subgraph of the difference graph using a lace construction similar to the one introduced in @xcite . starting from the left - most group ,",
    "we take the first line of the lace to be the one reaching as far as possible to the right .",
    "( note that there can be no more than one line between two groups , by construction , as our algorithm specifies that each line have one endpoint in a _ new _ group .",
    "thus there is no ambiguity about which line reaches the farthest to the right . ) the next line of the lace is taken as the one reaching the group farthest to the right from any of the groups spanned by the first line .",
    "( if two lines reach that group , we take the one originating from the group farthest to the right .",
    "this is unique because , as explained above , there can not be two lines connecting the same two groups . )",
    "we continue , always choosing the line reaching the group farthest to the right from the groups spanned by the expanding lace graph , and breaking ties by choosing the line originating from the group farthest to the right .",
    "see figure [ lace ] .    ]",
    "all lines not in the lace are left as is : a sum of two terms , as in the left - hand side of ( [ ( 4.35 ) ] ) .",
    "they are not needed for generating decay across the gaps between graphs .",
    "the lines of the lace graph extend all the way from the left - most group to the right - most one .",
    "therefore , by exhibiting decay between graphs connected by lace lines , we obtain decay across all gaps between groups .",
    "the lace graph has the property that no more than two lines emanate from any group .",
    "there can be one line to the left and one to the right , but a second on either side is impossible , by the rules for constructing the lace graph . as a consequence , we see that no more than two differences will be applied to any graph .",
    "this is important because of the need to limit the extent of duplication of denominators .",
    "the first difference creates a double denominator as in ( [ ( 4.35 ) ] ) .",
    "then ( [ ( 4.36 ) ] ) can be used to exhibit decay across the gap between the two graphs .",
    "the second difference creates a triple denominator as follows : when two differences are applied , we have four denominators , which may be written as @xmath951 , @xmath952 , @xmath953 , @xmath954 , with the first index indicating which spin configuration is involved on the left , and the second index indicating the one on the right .",
    "then we may use leibniz s rule to write @xmath955 for each term in the final expression , we may obtain decay across the gaps to the left and to the right when denominator differences are expanded as in ( [ ( 4.36 ) ] ) .",
    "( if a graph fails to cross both gaps , the result is zero because it can not feel both changes in spin configuration . )",
    "note that denominators can be tripled if differenced from both sides , but ( as claimed in the main text ) no power higher than 3 occurs .",
    "we need to provide estimates on the number of terms produced from applications of leibniz s rule in the above algorithm .",
    "recall that the range of dependence of denominators on the spin configuration is no greater than @xmath956  see ( [ range ] ) .",
    "this becomes a bound on the number of groups that can be reached with a difference line originating from a particular @xmath957 operation .",
    "when a difference operator hits a group , there is a sum over the graphs in the group ; this may be controlled most simply by assigning a combinatoric factor 2 to each graph in the group",
    ". the number of lines incident on a group can not exceed @xmath956 ( the maximum number of groups in range ) .",
    "hence each graph receives no more than a combinatoric factor @xmath958 .",
    "there are also factors of 2 per graph that were mentioned above , coming from the representation of a commutator as a sum of two terms or as a sum of two differences .",
    "the product of all these combinatoric factors is bounded by @xmath959 for each @xmath960 , in view of the minimum graph size in this step .",
    "thus the counting factors are in line with ones already considered in subsection [ 4.2.1 ] , and are controlled by the exponential bounds on graphs as in ( [ ( 4.2)]),([(4.6 ) ] ) .",
    "as one often finds in this type of argument , dangerous counting factors from applications of leibniz s rule are limited by geometrical considerations  in this case by the range limitation and the cap of one on the number of commutators per group that are expanded with leibniz s rule .",
