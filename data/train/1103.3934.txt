    "the standard model has been tested to a high degree of precision and the only missing link is the higgs scalar .",
    "apart from the direct search for higgs at lhc , the other purpose of lhc is to test the various extensions of the standard model such as supersymmetry , extra dimensions , technicolor , neutral vector boson @xmath8 and standard model with fourth generation of quarks and leptons ( sm4 ) .",
    "the search for new degrees of freedom at lhc can be done in two distinct ways .",
    "one is the direct search of the higgs boson and the particles beyond the sm to establish the new physics ( np ) theories .",
    "the other is the indirect way where we test the sm with high theoretical and experimental precision for which the rare @xmath4 meson decays are an ideal probe . among different",
    "@xmath4 meson decays the one which proceed through flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions , like @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are of special interest .",
    "this lies in the fact that fcnc transitions generally arise at loop level in the sm , and thus provide a good testing ground for the various extensions of the sm .",
    "the radiative decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 are easy to calculate but they have limited physical observables in comparison to the semileptonic @xmath13 decay",
    ". in semileptonic decays one can study number of physical observables like decay rate , forward - backward asymmetries , lepton polarization asymmetries and the isospin symmetries .",
    "the theoretical research in these semileptonic decay modes has been done with highly improved precision , see ref .",
    "@xcite , with good support from their experimental studies at b factories and the hadron colliders @xcite . with the start of lhc we are expecting better statistics ,",
    "the lhcb experiment can accumulate 6200 events per nominal running year at @xmath14 tev @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of measuring the zero - position of the forward - backward asymmetry at lhc will reduce to @xmath15 which may be further improved to @xmath16 after the upgrade @xcite .",
    "hence , its investigation will not only provide us an opportunity to discriminate between the sm and different np models but will also improve our understanding of the short - distance physics at an unprecedented level .",
    "the experimental observation of the @xmath17 decay at babar and belle @xcite indicates that its branching ratio is comparable to @xmath12 . the related decay mode with photon in the final state replaced by a pair of charged leptons",
    "has already been seen for @xmath18 .",
    "like @xmath19 the decay @xmath20 is also described by the quark level transition @xmath21 and hence the same np would be expected to affect their measurements .",
    "therefore , the analysis of @xmath6 process will usefully complement the much investigated decay process @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of this decay will provide some supplementary tests of the predictions of sm btotensor .",
    "it has already been mentioned that the unitarity of quark mixing matrix forbids the fcnc transitions at tree level in the sm . when loop corrections are taken into account",
    ", @xmath23 arises from the photon penguin , @xmath24 penguin and the @xmath25-box diagrams .",
    "the large mass scale of virtual states leads to tiny wilson coefficients in @xmath26 quark decays and thus @xmath23 would be sensitive to the potential np effects @xcite .",
    "these np effects enter in two distinct ways : in one scenario new operators not present in sm can emerge while in other scenario only the wilson coefficients of the sm operators get modified .",
    "sm with an extra generation of quarks is one of the simplest scenario of the later category and recently it has attracted an increasing interest ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for brief review on sm4 ) . in this work",
    "we study its impact on @xmath27 decays .",
    "the electroweak precision data does not exclude the complete existence of the fourth family and there are many reasons to introduce an extra generation of heavy particles @xcite .",
    "especially , lhc has a potential to discover or fully exclude the existence of a fourth generation of quarks up to 1 tev @xcite .",
    "even if they are too heavy to be observed directly they will induce a large signal in @xmath28 which will be clearly visible at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the sequential fourth generation model is a simple and non - supersymmetric extension of the sm , which does not add any new dynamics to the sm , with an additional up - type quark @xmath29 and down - type quark @xmath30 , a heavy charged lepton @xmath31 and an associated neutrino @xmath32 .",
    "being a simple extension of the sm it retains all the properties of the sm where the new top quark @xmath29 like the other up - type quarks , contributes to @xmath33 transition at the loop level .",
    "due to the additional fourth generation the quark mixing matrix ( ckm ) will become @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are new matrix elements in the sm4 .",
    "the parametrization of this unitary matrix requires six mixing angles and three phases [ 9 ] .",
    "the effects of sequential fourth generation have already been studied on different physical observables in @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 decays , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a short list .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze the possible fourth generation effects on the decay rates , forward - backward asymmetry @xmath38 , the final state lepton polarization asymmetries @xmath39 and the helicity fractions of @xmath40 meson @xmath41 in @xmath42 decays .",
    "it is well known that the constraints on the np parameters in @xmath43 are obtained mainly from the related decay modes @xmath44 and the golden channel @xmath45 . due to the large hadronic uncertainties ,",
    "the exclusive decays ( under discussion here ) @xmath46 provide weaker constraints than the inclusive decay modes @xmath47 .",
    "clearly our aim here is not to obtain the precise predictions of the sm4 but rather to obtain an understanding of how np arising from the sm4 affects different physical observables .    in these fcnc transitions the fourth generation top quark @xmath29 , like @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 quarks , contributes at loop level which result in the modification of the corresponding wilson coefficients . in our numerical study of @xmath6",
    "decays , we shall use the the form factors calculated using lcsr approach in ref .",
    "@xcite . by incorporating the recent constraints on the fourth generation parameters , @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 @xcite ,",
    "our results show that the decay rates of @xmath53 are quite sensitive to these parameters .",
    "the np effects in the decay rate are usually masked by the uncertainties associated with the different input parameters especially arising from the form factors .",
    "therefore , one has to look for the observables which have mild dependence on these form factors .",
    "the zero position of fba , lepton polarization asymmetries and helicity fractions of final state mesons are efficient tools to search for np .",
    "we have studied these asymmetries in the sm4 and found that the effects of fourth generation parameters are quite significant in some regions of parameter space of the sm4 .",
    "a qualitative comparison of the results of different physical observables of decays @xmath54 and @xmath55 will show that these two decays will compliment each other for certain physical observables .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the effective hamiltonian for the semileptonic decay @xmath56 , section iii contains the definitions and the numerical values of the form factors . in sec .",
    "iv we present the expressions of physical observables under discussion here .",

    "finally , the main results are summarized in sec .",
    "in the standard model ( sm3 ) the @xmath58 transition is governed by the effective hamiltonian @xmath59where @xmath60 @xmath61 are the four - quark operators and @xmath62 are the corresponding wilson  coefficients at the energy scale @xmath63 .",
    "currently these wilson coefficients are calculated in the sm at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next leading logarithm ( nnll ) and their explicit expressions are given in the literature @xcite . out of these 10 operators the ones which are responsible for @xmath6 are @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 and their form is given below @xmath67with @xmath68 . in terms of the above operators ,",
    "the free quark decay amplitude for @xmath69 @xmath70 in the sm can be derived as : @xmath71where @xmath72 is the square of the momentum transfer .",
    "the operator @xmath66 can not be induced by the insertion of four - quark operators because of the absence of the @xmath24 -boson in the effective theory .",
    "therefore , the wilson coefficient @xmath73 does not renormalize under qcd corrections and hence it is independent of the energy scale .",
    "in addition to this , the above quark level decay amplitude can receive contributions from the matrix elements of four - quark operators , @xmath74 , which are usually absorbed into the effective wilson coefficient @xmath75 , usually called @xmath76 , which can be decomposed into the following three parts @xmath77where the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 are defined as @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 describes the short - distance contributions from four - quark operators far away from the @xmath82 resonance regions , which can be calculated reliably in the perturbative theory .",
    "the long - distance contributions @xmath83 from four - quark operators near the @xmath82 resonance can not be calculated from first principles of qcd and are usually parameterized in the form of a phenomenological breit - wigner formula making use of the vacuum saturation approximation and quark - hadron duality .",
    "we will neglect the long - distance contributions in this work because of the absence of experimental data on @xmath84 and also the np effects lie far from the resonance region .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath81 can be written as buras @xmath85with @xmath86    apart from the correction to @xmath87 , the non - factorizable effects @xcite from the charm loop can bring about further corrections to the radiative @xmath11 transition , which can be absorbed into the effective wilson coefficient @xmath88 . specifically , the wilson coefficient @xmath88 is given by @xcite @xmath89with @xmath90 , \\\\ g_{1}(x_{t } ) & = & { \\frac{x_{t}(x_{t}^{2}-5x_{t}-2)}{8(x_{t}-1)^{3}}}+{\\frac{3x_{t}^{2}\\mathrm{ln}^{2}x_{t}}{4(x_{t}-1)^{4}}},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the absorptive part for the @xmath94 rescattering and we have dropped out the tiny contributions proportional to ckm sector @xmath95 . in addition , @xmath96 can be obtained by replacing @xmath97 with @xmath98 in the above expression .",
    "similar replacement @xmath99 has to be done for the other wilson coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath73 which have too lengthy expressions to be given here and their explicit expressions are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has already been pointed out that the sequential fourth generation does not change the operator basis of the sm , therefore , its effects will change the values of the wilson coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath73 via the virtual exchange of new generation up - type quark @xmath29 .",
    "the modified wilson coefficients will take the form;@xmath102where @xmath103 @xmath104 and the explicit forms of the @xmath105 s can be obtained from the corresponding expressions of the wilson coefficients in sm by putting @xmath106 .",
    "the addition of an extra family of quarks will also add an extra row and a column in the ckm matrix of the sm which now becomes @xmath107 and the unitarity of which leads to@xmath108since @xmath109 has a very small value compared to the other ckm matrix elements , therefore , it is safe to ignore it . thus from eq .",

    "( [ wilson - modified ] ) gives@xmath111here , one can clearly see that under @xmath112 or @xmath113 the term @xmath114 vanishes which is the requirement of gim mechanism . after including the @xmath29 quark in the loop the relevant wilson coefficients",

    "<S> the @xmath0 @xmath1 decays are analyzed in the standard model extended to fourth generation of quarks ( sm4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decay rate , forward - backward asymmetry , lepton polarization asymmetries and the helicity fractions of the final state @xmath2 meson are obtained using the form factors calculated in the light cone sum rules ( lcsr ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> we have utilized the constraints on different fourth generation parameters obtained from the experimental information on @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays and from the electroweak precision data to explore their impact on the @xmath6 decay . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the values of above mentioned physical observables deviate deviate significantly from their minimal sm predications . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify a number of correlations between various observables in @xmath0 and @xmath7 decays . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a combined analysis of these two decays will compliment each other in the searches of sm4 effects in flavor physics . </S>"
