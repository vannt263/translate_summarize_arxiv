    "in recent years , dynamical quantum phase transition ( dqpt ) has extended our understanding of phase transitions and universality greatly @xcite , which provides us a new perspective on exploring the behavior of phase transitions far from equilibrium . as a simple but important paradigm of nonequilibrium processes , the quantum quench attracted intensive studies . to describe the dynamics of a quantum system which",
    "is pushed out equilibrium by a sudden change of the hamiltonian , an important quantity is the loschmidt echo , which measures the overlap of the initial quantum state and the time - evolved state after the quench @xcite .",
    "many theoretical works have demonstrated that the loschidmt echo plays an important role in characterizing the nonequilibrium dynamic signature of a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "after mapping the loschmidt amplitude to a boundary partition function , the singularity of dynamical free energy density in thermodynamic limit can be found at critical times @xmath3 , which are similar to the well - known fisher zeros @xcite .",
    "this singularity is found to have relationship with the dynamics of order parameter @xcite . up to now , the dqpt has been explored in a series of models which are known to exhibit quantum phase transition , such as transverse field ising model ( tfim ) @xcite , anisotropic xy model @xcite , hubbard and falicov - kimball models @xcite and two - band topological systems @xcite , etc . thanks to the developments of quantum simulation techniques , dqpt has been realized by ions simulations of tfim @xcite . besides , by observing the appearance , movement , and annihilation of vortices in reciprocal space , dynamical topological order parameter has also been recognized in optical lattices systems @xcite .",
    "according to the theory of dqpt , the appearance of a series of zero points in the loschmidt echo at critical times @xmath3 can be viewed as a dynamic signature of quantum phase transitions . while most theoretical studies of dqpt and loschmidt echo focus on the traditional quantum systems driven by competing quantum terms @xcite , less attention is paid on the dynamics and loschmidt echo in a quantum disorder system which exhibits the localization - delocalization transition @xcite .",
    "a natural but interesting question is whether the loschmit echo can still be used to characterize the dqpt of a quantum disorder system ? and",
    "if yes , whether we can observe zero points of the loschmidt echo by studying the quench dynamics of the quantum disorder system ? aiming to answer these questions , in this work we shall study the quench dynamics in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) incommensurate lattice , which is effectively described by the aubry - andr ( aa ) model @xcite .",
    "it is known that all the eigenstates of the aa model are either extended or localized and there exists a transition from an extended state to a localized state with the change of the strength of incommensurate potential @xcite . the localization transition in the 1d incommensurate lattice has been experimentally verified in a bichromatic optical lattice by observing the expansion dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate initially trapped in the center of optical lattice @xcite , which exhibits different diffusion behaviors for the extended or localized phase @xcite .",
    "different from previous works on the expansion dynamics , we study the quench dynamics with the initial state being an eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian . after performing a sudden quench of the strength of incommensurate potential @xmath0 , the behaviors of loschmidt echo are found to be quite different depending on whether the initial and final hamiltonians locate in the same phase regime or not .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and study the quench dynamics in the limiting cases of quenching between @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath1 ) . in these two limiting cases , we can give analytical expressions of the loschmidt echo and demonstrate that there are a series of zeros of loschmidt echo , which is also consistent with our numerical results . in section iii , we study the general quench process , for which no analytical results are available and we thus study the evolution of loschmidt echo with the help of numerical methods . by analyzing the statistical behavior of the values of loschmidt echo in a long time ,",
    "we demonstrate that loschmidt echo will oscillate and take a finite value in the case of quenching in the same phase , while loschmidt echo can approach zero in the case of quenching in different phases .",
    "a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "we investigate the aa model with hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of fermions , @xmath7 is hopping amplitude , @xmath8 is an irrational number and @xmath0 is the strength of the incommensurate potential .",
    "the incommensurate potential can be viewed as a kind of quasi - random disorder , which drives the system undergoing a delocalization - localization transition at @xmath9 . when @xmath10 , all the eigenstates are extended , whereas all the eigenstates are localized , when @xmath11 @xcite . for convenience",
    "we take @xmath12 as the energy unit and fix @xmath13 .    while conventional studies of dynamical properties in disordered systems focus on the diffusion of a wave packet , in this work we consider the quench dynamics of the incommensurate system described by the aa model . by preparing the system as an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath14 and then performing a sudden quench to the final hamiltonian @xmath15",
    ", we consider the behavior of loschmidt amplitude ( return amplitude ) @xmath16 and loschmidt echo ( return probability ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) represents the strength of the incommensurate potential corresponding to the initial ( final ) state before ( after ) the quench .",
    "it is known that the loschmidt echo plays an important role in the theory of dqpts .",
    "the behavior of loschmidt echo approaching zero at some times @xmath21 in the thermodynamic limit can be viewed as a signature of the occurrence of the dqpt , which has been demonstrated by studying various models exhibiting quantum phase transitions .",
    "however , it is still not clear whether the loschmidt echo approaching zero can be viewed as a signature for the localization - delocalization transition , which shall be clarified in this work . in order to get an intuitive understanding ,",
    "we first consider two limiting cases of quench processes , i.e. , quench processes between states with @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath25 , which can be calculated analytically , whereas the general quench processes between arbitrary @xmath19 and @xmath20 are studied with the help of numerical calculations ..    s and the size of the system @xmath26 .",

    "so we can approximately replace the summation by the integration @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the zero - order bessel function . from the properties of bessel function , we know that @xmath53 has a series of zeros @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "these zeros indicate the loschmit amplitude and echo reach zero at times @xmath56    according to the theory of dqpt , the occurrence of a series of zeros in the loschmit amplitude can be viewed as the signature of dqpt as these zeros correspond to divergences of the boundary partition function .",
