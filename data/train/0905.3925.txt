    "the `` big dipper '' 624 , with its high energy ( @xmath11kev ) flaring between dips , is one of the most ` extreme ' of the dipping sources .",
    "its nickname derives in part from the fact that it has one of the longest orbital periods ( 21hr @xmath12ks ; @xcite ) and dips that last @xmath13ks @xcite .",
    "the prevailing idea for explaining this behavior is that the dips are likely due to obscuration by a raised accretion disk rim at the location where the infalling accretion stream impacts the disk . by accounting for the quasi - steady x - ray dust scattering halo",
    ", one can show that obscuration during dips is @xmath1490% @xcite .",
    "the dips exhibit broad , shallow shoulders , with a rapid ingress / egress to the deepest dip levels .",
    "a point - like soft x - ray source reasonably can be inferred from the rapid ingress / egress and dip variability .",
    "while the dipping seems to saturate at a minimum level , rapid ( @xmath15  s ) , short duration , large amplitude spikes are seen .",
    "this behavior argues for the obscuring medium having a well - defined boundary , but a highly variable , erratic covering .    since its discovery @xcite",
    ", 624 has been studied extensively with x - ray telescopes including  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite . from these studies",
    "we know that 624 is highly absorbed , both extrinsically _ and _ intrinsically .",
    "models have been developed over the years wherein the spectrum consists of : large external absorption , a scattering halo , a point - like ( i.e. , rapidly absorbed ) blackbody , and an extended ( i.e. , partially absorbed ) accretion disk corona ( adc ) @xcite .",
    "observations also have revealed a _ broad _ fe k@xmath16 emission line @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that we are viewing both the inner ( point - like source , broad lines ) and outer ( dips , variable absorption ) accretion disk regions in this highly inclined , high eddington fraction , low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .    from the point of view of high resolution  spectroscopy",
    ", 624 may be in many ways analogous to the bright , highly inclined , variable , and absorbed microquasar 1915 @xcite .",
    "as such , there are key questions concerning the physical environment of 624 that _ only _ high resolution x - ray spectroscopy can address .",
    "is the extended corona a photoionized atmosphere in equilibrium ?",
    "medium resolution  epic data provide some clues .",
    "@xcite identified ` narrow ' ( @xmath1750ev ) resonant absorption lines from fe  xxvi  ly@xmath16 , fe  xxvi  he  @xmath16 , and a broad(er ) 470  ev fe  k@xmath16 emission line ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "like all x - ray sensitive ccd cameras , however , the  epic , with a resolution comparable to the  sis , is fundamentally limited in the extent to which it can resolve such features",
    ". a recent analysis of these  grating observations by @xcite , while providing a better measurement of the ionized fe lines given the better heg resolution compared with epic in this spectral band , did not undertake the in - depth modeling necessary to describe the viewing geometry for the photoionized gas .",
    "furthermore , based on the analysis presented in this paper , we offer an alternative scenario to the interpretation of iaria et al .  that the observed absorption line width can be attributed to bulk comptonization .    as a prelude to this paper",
    ", we studied the dust scattering halo properties of 624 with this  high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) observation in an attempt to first better understand the distribution of intervening line - of - sight material ( size and spatial distribution of dust grains ) , which we found to be heterogeneously distributed near the source and in the spiral arms of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "additionally , by measuring scattering delay times as a function of angular distance in comparison to the 624 source light curve , we were able to obtain a much more accurate distance measurement of @xmath18  kpc to 624 . in this paper",
    ", we use the same -hetgs observation to focus on the binary properties with an in - depth analysis of the hetgs spectra .",
    "( these are the same data published by @xcite . )",
    "specifically , we explore the persistent - phase spectrum over the 624 orbital period in the context of  [ sec - continuum ] : photoionization modeling using xstar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* version 2.1kn7 ) , and  [ sec - absorption ] : detailed variability studies of the detected ionized and absorption lines and continuum .",
    "in particular , we study the orbital phase evolution of the detected absorption lines as a function of the time periods immediately before and after (  [ sec - prepost ] ) , as well as near to and far from the dipping events (  [ sec - nfdip ] ) , in addition to an analysis of the short - duration ( @xmath19  ks ) absorption changes over the 624 @xmath20 orbital period .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in  [ sec - discussion ] in the context of a simple two temperature absorber model , and we specifically focus on the quasi - sinusoidal modulation of these plasma components , as well as modulation of the continuum components , over the binary orbital period .",
    "we observed 624 with the  high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs , @xcite ) in timed graded mode beginning at 06:26:06 ut on 2004 june 04 ( mjd 53160.26813 , obsid : 4559 ) , covering one binary orbit of @xmath2176  ks .",
    "given that 624 is bright ( @xmath2150mcrab , @xcite , @xcite ) , we mitigate pileup and telemetry problems by using a one - half subarray of 512 columns per ccd in order to reduce the frame - time to 1.7  s from the nominal 3.2  s. despite these efforts , the 0@xmath22 order acis - s data are heavily piled - up , rendering difficult the drawing of useful conclusions from the 0th order spectrum .",
    "accordingly , this paper focuses only on spectral and light curve analysis of the hetgs grating spectra .",
    "we use ciao  3.4 with caldb  3.3 for our data reduction efforts . in order to ensure the most accurate wavelength measurements possible for this observation",
    ", we calculate the exact zero order position using a code that fits the intersection of the dispersed meg data with the zeroth - order `` readout trace '' on the acis - s3 chip . using this technique",
    "it is expected the accuracy of the 0@xmath22 order position is better than 0.1 detector pixels , translating to a wavelength accuracy of 0.001  ( corresponding to 164  km  s@xmath23 at 6.8  kev ) for both the high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) first orders .",
    "positive and negative first order spectra for heg and meg were combined for analysis .    for our analysis",
    ", we generate @xmath24-order time - averaged heg and meg spectra spanning the non - dip phases of the full 76  ks orbital period ( resulting in @xmath2167  ks of usable data ) to study the properties of the persistent phase continuum spectrum and to look for faint lines (  [ sec - continuum ] ) .",
    "we also generate phase - dependent spectra ( labeled `` a  g '' , and combinations thereof , as indicated by the light curve in fig .",
    "[ fig - lc ] ) to study the time evolution of the plasma via observed changes in the line profiles and fluxes (  [ sec - absorption ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - lc ] also shows that our observation encompasses @xmath219.7  ks ( @xmath212.7 hrs ; sum of dip phases 1 + 2 + 3 ) worth of occulted periods .",
    "the longest duration of an individual dip is seen to be @xmath213.5  ks , and the largest occultation is @xmath2190% .",
    "possibly because of the low energy absorption , the spectrum is seen to harden during dipping periods .",
    "we are unable to extract useful information from the _ dip - phase _ hetgs spectrum due to the low counts .      as a prelude to spectral analysis , we first determined pileup fraction ( defined to be the fraction of frames that have detected events containing two or more events per frame per pixel ) in the first order grating spectra .",
    "since pileup is dependent on the count rate in each ccd pixel , we use the count rate in the heg@xmath251 and meg@xmath251 spectra for our estimates .",
    "we find that the maximal pileup fraction of heg + 1 and @xmath26 order spectra is @xmath211.0% at @xmath212.5   ( @xmath215  kev ) .",
    "similarly meg + 1 and @xmath26 order spectra are piled up at less than @xmath211.0% except for the range 2.53.5   ( 3.55.0  kev ) where the maximal pileup fraction reaches @xmath212.0% .",
    "accordingly , we ignore regions of the spectrum with pileup @xmath141% . as such",
    ", we fit only to 1.27.3   ( 1.710.0  kev ) heg spectra , and meg spectra over the 1.52.5   ( 1.73.5  kev ) and 3.57.5   ( 5.08.0  kev ) range .",
    "the spectra are rebinned to satisfy a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath27 and 0.005 per bin for the heg 1@xmath28 order , @xmath27 and 0.01    per bin for the meg 1@xmath28 order , respectively .",
    "isis @xcite was used as the fitting engine for our analysis .",
    "the 624 broadband continuum as determined from the heg spectrum has already been discussed at length in our previous paper focusing on the scattering halo associated with this source @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the meg spectrum to our fitting here gives consistent results for a blackbody + power - law continuum modified by absorption from neutral material ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these parameters are listed in column 3 of table [ tab - cont ] , and a spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - continuum ] . in our previous work",
    ", however , we were concerned by the fact that our best - fit parameters were noticeably different from that published by @xcite for the same data set . in particular",
    ", our best - fit photon index @xmath30 is slightly harder than the @xmath31 noted by iaria et al .",
    "a cursory check showed that the difference had very little to do with absorption models , e.g. , @xmath32 for phabs @xcite , versus @xmath33 for tbabs , which use the updated cross - sections and abundances of @xcite , fitting tools ( e.g. , isis versus xspec ) , binning , or choice of fitted spectral regions . for completeness",
    ", we also looked into calibration effects and find that at least some of the differences had to do with a difference between caldb 3.2 ( used by iaria et al . ) versus caldb 3.3 ( this paper ) .",
    "a reduction of the 624 spectra using caldb 3.2 resulted in a slightly softer power - law ( @xmath34 ) , compared to our caldb 3.3 value of @xmath32 ( phabs ) .",
    "even though the caldb 3.2 measure of photon index is closer to the @xmath31 value quoted by iaria et al .  for this data",
    "set , a full agreement with the values of iaria et al .",
    "is not reached even when trying to reproduce every step of their analysis process .",
    "we can only speculate that a combination of effects , including new reprocessing that accounts for afterglow events , and the careful treatment of pileup incorporated here may be responsible for the rest of the discrepancy .",
    "we also note that our photon index is slightly harder than the values of @xmath35 for a observation by @xcite and @xmath36 for a observation by @xcite .",
    "the difference is possibly caused by the different luminosity states ( see the next paragraph ) or by the limited -hetgs band coverage ( e.g. 0.510  kev ) and the severe absorption at the low energies coupled with limited counts at the high energies .",
    "based upon our best - fit continuum , the 0.610kev flux of 624 is @xmath37  erg  @xmath38  s@xmath23 ( @xmath39  mcrab ) , corresponding to an unabsorbed 0.610 kev luminosity of @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath23 ( assuming a distance of 15.0  kpc as determined from our scattering halo analysis ; @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity is similar to that observed with  @xcite but significantly lower than that using the @xcite and  @xcite observations .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the luminosity during different observations can change significantly and thus the emission parameters should not necessarily be expected to completely consistent .    as an alternative to the continuum model of a blackbody plus power - law",
    ", we also considered a continuum consisting solely of a partially covered power - law . in this model , the soft excess that had been described by the blackbody",
    "is now modeled by the soft end of the uncovered power - law .",
    "specifically , the model is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the equivalent hydrogen column along the line - of - sight , @xmath43 is the equivalent hydrogen column local to the system , @xmath44 is the normalization of the power - law continuum , and @xmath45 is the partial covering fraction . we find that this model ( @xmath46 ) describes the persistent phase spectrum slightly better than the blackbody plus power - law model ( @xmath47 ) , and yields values of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . again , as discussed above , the limited -hetgs band coverage ( e.g. 0.510  kev ) and the limited counts at high energies do not allow us to distinguish between these two models for the time averaged spectra .",
    "thus for some of the results that follow , e.g. , the modeling of the broad emission line (  [ sec - bline ] ) and narrow ionized absorption lines (  [ sec - line ] ) , the results are insensitive to which continuum model that we choose . as we elaborate upon in the discussion of short time scale changes (  [ sec - sdchange ] ) , however , the partial covering model may more naturally explain spectral variations associated with the source s lightcurve .",
    "a significant and broad excess around 6.6  kev was found when we checked the fit residuals in both the heg and meg spectra .",
    "we also saw deficits around 6.7  kev and 7.0  kev corresponding to narrow absorption lines .",
    "these are discussed in more detail in ",
    "[ sec - line ]  and   [ sec - absorption ] .",
    "the broad excess has been identified with fe k emission typically detected in lmxbs ( @xmath51 significant detection : @xcite with _ tenma _ ; with _ exosat _ , @xcite and @xcite ; @xcite for an _ asca _ study of 20  lmxbs , including 624 ) .",
    "@xcite postulate that the line is likely produced through the radiative recombination in a photoionized plasma and that its broad width is attributable to a confluence of processes in the adc , including compton scattering and doppler shifts arising from keplerian motions .",
    "@xcite also studied the broad emission line from 624 with , and found that the best - fit energy for the emission line depends on whether or not the fe absorption lines were also modeled .",
    "when the absorption lines were included , @xcite found a best - fit emission energy of @xmath52  kev in contrast to the @xmath53  kev value found when the absorption features were excluded .",
    "the heg clearly shows strong and absorption lines in our heg spectrum , which are therefore included in our modeling of the the broad emission feature .",
    "the continuum model is the blackbody plus power - law model of  [ sec - broad ] .    like the persistent phase spectrum , the far - dip ( _ a+e+f+g _ ; @xmath2139  ks ) and near - dip ( _ b+c+d _ ; @xmath2129  ks ) spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig - line2 ] reveal a broad emission line with a best - fit energy that is most consistent with he - like at @xmath54  kev ( table  [ tab - cont ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the peak energy for the broad emission feature in the near - dip phase spectrum points to even higher ionization h - like and to a broader velocity width , although the uncertainties of the modeling do not allow us to make any strong claims to this effect .",
    "if real , it would be of interest to consider whether compton scattering can be a mechanism for line broadening in lmxbs as suggested by @xcite .",
    "note that the highest values for the fitted line width , @xmath55kev , correspond to velocities that if associated with the accretion disk arise at radii @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the broad emission line is not necessarily cospatial with the blackbody component , if indeed a blackbody+powerlaw is the better description of the true , underlying physical description of the observed spectra .",
    "the presence of a broad line therefore does not provide us with a means of distinguishing between the blackbody+powerlaw and partially covered powerlaw models for the continuum spectra , and could be consistent with either model .",
    "the three most obvious absorption lines that show up in the -hetgs spectra ( at @xmath21  7.0  kev/1.778   at @xmath216.7  kev/1.850   and at @xmath214.1  kev/3.020   ; see fig .",
    "[ fig - continuum ] ) have already been reported by iaria _",
    "et al _ , albeit based upon gaussian fits to these data , as opposed to the modeling with photoionization codes as we present in this work .",
    "ionized absorption lines were initially discovered for 624 in epic data @xcite . here ,",
    "for the time - averaged spectra we go beyond previous studies by modeling the absorption spectrum of 624 using an analytic version of xstar  v2.1ln2 @xcite . for",
    "these xstar fits , the column density , ionization , turbulent velocity width , and velocity shift were allowed to vary .",
    "the abundance of elements from c to fe were fixed at solar values @xcite , although subsequent fits that allowed these parameters to vary gave abundance results similar to solar values within 90% confidence errors .",
    "if we adopt the interpretation of iaria et al .  and consider a one - zone plasma , the time - averaged spectrum over the course of the 624 orbital period can be modeled reasonably well with a hot plasma of @xmath57 ionizing a column of log  @xmath58 , with turbulent velocities of @xmath59 . because our variability analysis of  [ sec - absorption ] strongly points to a two - ionization zone model for the 624 absorbers ,",
    "we describe our model for the time - averaged spectrum accordingly . for this model , a combination of ionized absorber-1 ( @xmath60 ; @xmath61 ; @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ) , and absorber-2 ( @xmath64 ; @xmath65 ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , provides a better fit .",
    "interestingly , for either scenario the component can not be modeled well unless the abundance of ar is set to @xmath21twice solar .",
    "table  [ tab : xstar ] lists ions detected in our spectrum , and also the strong lines that are predicted by our xstar models to have equivalent widths @xmath68  m , including three strong lines of , and .      given that the light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig - lc ] ) clearly indicates a blockage of the primary by the accretion stream and/or secondary , we next investigate relevant effects this might have on the observed ionized absorption . for this",
    ", we concentrate only on the evolution of the strongest absorption lines , i.e. , and , over the course of the 624 @xmath21  76  ks orbital period , as the source moves in and out of occultation . for this analysis ,",
    "we use only the heg given its higher resolution and throughput in this energy band .      a simple overlay of the pre - dip ( _ a+b _ ; @xmath2120  ks ) and post - dip ( _ d+e+f+g _ ;",
    "@xmath2138  ks ) phases reveal nearly identical spectra .",
    "our analysis here uses the blackbody plus power - law continuum (  [ sec - continuum ] ) and broad fe emission line (  [ sec - bline ] ) to model the more global features .",
    "while the underlying components are similar to that used for the time averaged spectrum , the best - fit parameters differ slightly . to quantify this effect",
    ", we assess fe line changes by adding gaussians to model the and absorption . the best - fit parameters ( table  [ tab - gauss ] ) do not indicate significant changes in absorption between the _ pre - dip _ and _ post - dip _ phases , so for these fits we do not proceed with the more involved xstar modeling .",
    "next , we considered a comparison between the _ near - dip _ ( _ b+c+d ; _ @xmath69",
    "ks ) and _ far - dip : ( a+e+f+g _ ; @xmath70  ks ) spectra following ( initially ) the procedure of  [ sec - prepost ] . based on simple gaussian fits , distinct fe line changes",
    "are observed in the line parameters , most noticeably in the velocity width , equivalent width , and line flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig - line2 ] and table  [ tab - gauss ] ) .",
    "[ fig - line2 ] and table  [ tab - gauss ] reveal distinct fe absorption line changes with the : flux ratios indicating noticeable plasma changes ( temperature & ionization ) between the _ near - dip _ and _ far - dip _ phases .    in an attempt towards a more physically realistic picture explaining these changes ,",
    "we proceed with more rigorous photoionization modeling of these spectra . for this",
    ", we fixed the continuum parameters specific to each phase , and varied the xstar parameters as before to model the and absorption features . for these spectra",
    ", we find that a single ionization absorber gives an overall reasonable fit in a @xmath71 sense , but does not fully describe the fe xxv absorption line .",
    "the fact that the relative and velocity shifts are different in the far - dip and near - dip spectra ( i.e. , fig .",
    "[ fig - line2 ] ) suggests that a more realistic physical model should consider two ionized absorbers arising from different physical regions .",
    "a fit to these near - dip and far - dip spectra using such a two - component ionized plasma : one hot ( @xmath72  k corresponding to @xmath73 ) and another slightly cooler ( @xmath74  k ; @xmath75 ) , gives a better description ( fig .  [ fig - line2 ] ) . by adding this second component , the @xmath76 of the fit to the near - dip phases is reduced from 1047 for 1063 d.o.f ( one - component ionized plasma ) to 1033 for 1059 d.o.f ( two - component ionized plasma ) .",
    "this yields an f - statistic value of 3.6 , which for these four additional degrees of freedom formally corresponds to an improved fit at @xmath77 confidence .",
    "( see , however , @xcite for a discussion of the applicability of the f - test in situations such as those presented here . )",
    "we therefore view the two - component ionized plasma model as a more likely scenario for the 624 x - ray emitting regions .",
    "since there is clear evidence for absorber changes when comparing the far- and near - dip periods , we conclude our analysis of the spectral variability by dividing the total persistent spectra into 7 approximately equal duration parts of @xmath2110  ks each ( figs .",
    "[ fig - lc ] , [ fig - line ]  and  [ fig - evo ] ) . of interest is whether the blackbody+power - law or partial coverer+power - law components vary with orbital phase .",
    "we first test for such variations by fitting our blackbody plus power - law continuum model , including the broad emission line and narrow fe absorption lines .",
    "[ fig - evo]-(ii , iii ) and table  [ tab-7con ] show that the unabsorbed fluxes of both the blackbody and power - law components , and to some extent the absorbed flux of the blackbody component , remain relatively steady over the 624 orbital period . the absorbed power - law component , however , is seen to vary more dramatically , and in a quasi - sinusoidal fashion ( @xmath2195% confidence ) .",
    "we note that the quasi - sinusoidal variation of the absorbed blackbody component is less than that of the absorbed power - law , and perhaps exhibits an anti - correlation with the power - law .",
    "we therefore assess the statistical correlation between these parameters by generating confidence contours for phase ( g ) ( see fig [ fig - line ] and [ fig - evo ] ) .",
    "these contours indicate a marked degree of dependence of the absorbed power - law and blackbody fluxes upon each other ; therefore , in deriving a period for the modulation of the flux , we tie these two components together and fit a sine function to the points of fig .",
    "[ fig - evo]-(iii ) . specifically , the power - law and blackbody fluxes are tied together , but the power - law flux is allowed a 1/2 period ( delayed ) phase shift . at 90% confidence , we derive a period @xmath78  ks ( @xmath21  12  hrs ) , slightly more than half the orbital period .    next , we explore the time dependence of the partial covering model ( see the description in  [ sec - broad ] ) by fitting simultaneously the seven phased spectra .",
    "we wish to determine whether the change of the absorbed power - law flux is produced by variation of the local cold gas . here",
    "we tie together all fit parameters ( including power - law normalization and slope ) , but allow the partial covering fraction and local absorption , i.e , the cold absorption along the line - of - sight , to vary with orbital phase .",
    "we find that this model describes the seven phased spectra well , giving @xmath76 of 5971 for 5896 degrees of freedom and yields values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig - partial ] shows that the equivalent hydrogen column density of the local cold absorber varies significantly over the orbital phase , while the partial covering factor remains relatively steady .",
    "this variation of the hydrogen column density of the local cold absorber is very similar to the phase - dependent variations seen for the absorbed power - law flux in the alternative blackbody+power - law models described above ; therefore , we also use a sine function to fit the points of fig .",
    "[ fig - partial]-(iii ) . at 90% confidence",
    ", we derive a period @xmath81  ks , similar to the fits above .",
    "again , we are seeing evidence that the observed orbital modulations are predominantly driven by absorption variations , rather than by intrinsic source variations , regardless of whether we fit a blackbody plus power - law model , or instead fit a partial covering model of a single component ( i.e. , the power - law ) .",
    "we also investigate and absorption line changes over these smaller time segments by fitting gaussian lines to the absorption features while fixing the continuum parameters to the phase - specific values of table  [ tab-7con ] .",
    "( here , the heg spectrum is binned to 0.005    bin@xmath23 . )",
    "table  [ tab - fe ] and figs .",
    "[ fig - line ]  and  [ fig - evo]-(iv ) show that the velocity width is narrowest during phases  _ c _  and  _ d _ that occur immediately after dipping events . in contrast , it appears that it is the flux and velocity shift that change most dramatically over the orbital period , supporting our interpretation that these lines originate in different regions ( see  [ sec - discussion ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings from previous sections ( see , e.g. , table  [ tab - warmabs ] ) whereby a comparison between xstar modelling of the the near - dip and far - dip regions show that the largest changes come from the less ionized `` warm '' region of @xmath82 .",
    "our -hetgs spectral study of 624over its orbital period confirms the detection of h- and he - like and absorption .",
    "detailed photoionization modelling with xstar predicts additional lines from , , and .",
    "of particular note is not only the confirmation of these lines with detailed photoionization modelling , but also that the variability analysis strongly suggests that these lines can be identified as originating from the accretion disk corona ( dominated by high ionization plasma giving rise predominantly to ) and the outer accretion disk ( as indicated by the flux evolution of the lower ionization variable absorption ) .",
    "while the time - averaged spectrum over the 624 orbital period can be modeled reasonably well with one ionization zone , variability studies instead suggest that a model with two ionization zones is a better description of the data .",
    "this interpretation has important implications for geometric scenarios and our ability to map the emitting regions as a function of orbital phase . in an earlier analysis of this data",
    "set , @xcite claimed velocity widths of up to 3500  @xmath83 , to which they attribute an origin between the external region of the adc and the disk edge . in this interpretation , the broadening would be due to bulk motion or turbulence connected to the coronal activity .",
    "our variability results indicate that neither bulk motion nor turbulence is necessary to produce the line widths .",
    "we arrive at this conclusion based on variability studies where line velocity widths are seen to change over relatively short time scales , _ and _ that in some phases the velocity widths are comparable to the heg fwhm resolution ( i.e. , during the near - dip phase , and during the far - dip phase ) and therefore are easily described by thermal broadening .",
    "to take our two - region model further , we consider it in the context of simple arguments relating the ionization parameter to the location of the absorbing plasma .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the ionization parameter @xmath84 can be defined by the relation @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the total un - absorbed source luminosity ( @xmath87ergss@xmath23 between 110  kev during the epoch of our 624 observation ) and @xmath88 is the distance to the absorbing plasma . the electron particle density @xmath89 is characterized by the thickness of the absorbing medium , @xmath90 , and the equivalent hydrogen column of the ionized region .",
    "using this , we consider the possible range of @xmath88 for the plasma giving rise to the observed ionized absorption lines .",
    "a sketch of a scenario explaining the major results of such an analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - model ] .",
    "as discussed above , the observed orbital variability of the different spectral components points towards an extended adc similar to the emission geometry proposed by @xcite or @xcite ( see @xcite for a summary ) . in this model ,",
    "the adc is large and therefore only slight variations of its components with orbital phase are expected , in line with our observation that the hot plasma component is constant over the orbit .",
    "this location of the hot component is consistent with the spectral analysis : our modelling efforts show that the gas component can be described by @xmath91 ( @xmath92  k ) ionizing a plasma of column @xmath93 .",
    "`` naively '' assuming a geometrically thick @xmath94 , a distance @xmath6  cm is obtained , which is comparable to the size of the accretion disk corona ( adc ) derived from the relation @xmath95 of @xcite .",
    "a similar value for an extended adc was recently determined by @xcite while measuring doppler broadening in several broad emission lines in .",
    "in contrast , @xmath96 changes more dramatically over the 624 orbital phase with the largest differences seen in a comparison between the far - dip ( @xmath7 ; @xmath97  k ) and near - dip ( @xmath98 ; @xmath99  k ) phases .",
    "this component can not originate in the adc : if one assumes @xmath94 and a column density of @xmath100 as appropriate for the component ( table  [ tab - warmabs ] ) , the data require @xmath101  cm , which is significantly larger than the likely accretion disk radius of @xmath102 cm . if , however , a geometrically thin plasma of @xmath103 is assumed for this component , absorber distances between @xmath104  cm ( near - dip ) and @xmath105  cm ( far - dip ) are obtained . since the radius of the accretion disk is @xmath106 cm as obtained from the roche lobe size of the neutron star @xcite , it is therefore likely that the warm component originates in the accretion disk rim , e.g. , where the accretion stream impacts onto the disk and where gas is irradiated by the neutron star .",
    "we note that this interpretation of the absorbers is also consistent with the variation of the broad - band spectral parameters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - evo ] . in terms of the model of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the blackbody component is taken to originate from the neutron star , while the power - law component is interpreted as being due to comptonization in the extended adc . in this interpretation",
    "the power - law component is expected to exhibit a quasi - sinusoidal variation and to be weakest during the times of dipping when the adc is partly covered by the warm absorbing material .",
    "a consequence of this model is also that the ratio fe  xxv / fe  xxvi shows a maximum during the dipping , since the optical depth in fe  xxv is largest during that time .",
    "we also note that the evolution of the spectrum can be modeled with partial covering of a single power - law component , with the local absorber varying over orbital phase .",
    "in such a model , the soft - end of the uncovered power - law replaces the blackbody component .",
    "this offers a slightly different explanation of the relative strength of the variation of the absorbed power - law component , relative to the blackbody .",
    "the `` covered power - law '' is that portion of the adc at low latitudes , where obscuration by the disk is expected to be greatest , and the adc is expected to be widest .",
    "the `` uncovered power - law '' arises from a geometrically narrower region at high latitudes , where obscuration by the disk is the least . for either the blackbody plus power - law scenario , or the partial covering scenario",
    ", our analysis shows that variations are predominantly driven by changes in obscuration , rather than any intrinsic variation of the components .",
    "we summarize the major conclusions and discoveries of this paper :    * a re - analysis of the -hetgs spectrum of 624 based on photoionization modelling and variability studies , shows that while the continuum spectrum can be modeled using a blackbody plus power - law , a slightly more preferred model is a single @xmath1 power - law partially ( 71% ) covered by a local absorber of column density @xmath107 .",
    "the total @xmath108 large line - of - sight ( @xmath109 ) column therefore can attenuate the power - law up to 5  kev , even though the x - ray spectrum can be seen down to 1.7  kev .",
    "for spectra with limited ( e.g. 0.5 - 10  kev ) band coverage , the severe absorption at the low energies coupled with limited counts at the high energies can flatten a @xmath1 power - law to appear as @xmath110 .",
    "the source luminosity at the epoch of our observations is estimated to be @xmath111 for a distance of 15 kpc as recently determined by @xcite . *",
    "we report the discovery of a possible quasi - sinusoidal modulation with period @xmath112  ks over the @xmath113  ks orbital period , with the caveat that we have observed 624 only over one binary orbit .",
    "there is strong indication that variations in observed spectral properties are predominantly driven by changes in obscuration , rather than any intrinsic variation of the power - law or black - body components .",
    "* we confirm the detection of ionized absorption from , , and , which have been detected by @xcite . _",
    "detailed photoionization modeling with xstar has allowed us to derive the strengths of other absorption lines of mg , si , s and ar . _",
    "* our detailed variability studies of detected strong absorption lines point to a two - temperature plasma for their origin : a highly ionized component of @xmath4 ( t@xmath114  k ) associated with an extended accretion disk corona of @xmath6  cm , and a less ionized more variable component of @xmath7 ( t@xmath115  k ; far - dip ) and @xmath116 ( t@xmath117  k ; near - dip ) coincident with the accretion disk rim .",
    "this model is offered in favor of bulk comptonization , as previously suggested , as an explanation for observed line broadening .",
    "* we also report and absorption line variations ( in wavelength , strength , width ) over the 624 orbital period .",
