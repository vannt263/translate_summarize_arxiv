    "it is important to understand the magnetic structure of two - dimensional antiferromagnetic in the light - doping region in the study of cuprate high - temperature superconductors@xcite .",

    "the influence of doping holes on the antiferromagnetic state in the parent materials of cuprate superconductors is one of the most interesting problems in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "it has been experimentally found that the stripe order is stabilized in the underdoped region of la@xmath0nd@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3,@xcite la@xmath4sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco)@xcite , and la@xmath4ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3@xcite .",

    "it has been pointed out that these types of modulated structures can be understood within the framework of correlated electrons by using the variational monte carlo method for the two - dimensional hubbard model@xcite .",
    "it is expected that there appears a new state in an extremely light - doping region where the charge modulated structures such as stripes and checkerboards are instable and only spin - modulations , for example , a spin - vortex state , will be formulated .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate spin - vortex excitation on the basis of the two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet . in this paper",

    "this model describes the nambu - goldstone mode , that is , the spin - wave mode of the quantum antiferromagnetic model .",
    "the renormalization of the spin - wave mode was investigated using the wilson - kogut renormalization method@xcite .    in the case of hole doping ,",
    "when the doping rate is small , the nonlinear sigma model is expected to be still relevant if we use the coupling constant @xmath30 renormalized by the doping effect .",
    "it is plausible that we can use the nonlinear sigma model for the extremely light - doping case .",
    "the 2d nonlinear sigma model has an instanton solution @xcite ( being interpreted as skyrmion or meron@xcite ) which describes an excitation of spin - vortex type .",
    "quantum fluctuations of instantons were computed and found to be reduced to the study of the coulomb gas@xcite . according to this study ,",
    "the gas of instantons of the 2d nonlinear sigma model is in the plasma phase .",
    "this means that spin - vortex excitations are independent each other and never form dimers .",
    "this is the case for the two - dimensional classical heisenberg model .",
    "then , we necessarily have a question such as : is this picture still correct for the ( 2 + 1)d nonlinear sigma model ? to investigate this , we generalize the instanton gas approximation to the ( 2 + 1)d nonlinear sigma model .",
    "we use the parametrization of the field @xmath15 in terms of a single complex field @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the complex conjugate of @xmath32 .",

    "the particle dynamics corresponds to the oscillation of the size of spin - vortex pair ( fig.2 ) .",

    "this term is expected to be unimportant and we neglect it .",
    "hence , the model is reduced to the coulomb gas model without the kinetic term",

    "we have formulated skyrmion ( instanton ) gas picture for the two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet on the basis of the ( 2 + 1)d nonlinear sigma model .",
    "we have shown that there is a kosterlitz - thouless transition from the plasma phase to the molecular phase as the temperature is lowered by using a static approximation to the instanton gas . in the molecular phase two instantons form a bound state , namely , a dipole of two spin vortices .",
