    "the study of soliton collisions in nonintegrable systems @xcite is interesting because such systems typically describe more realistic situations than the integrable systems where the interactions between solitons are known to be purely elastic @xcite . in nonintegrable systems",
    ", the collision outcome can be highly nontrivial and , depending on the degree of nonintegrability , the collision scenario can have qualitatively different features .    for the classical @xmath0 equation , @xmath1 which is rather far from an integrable system , kink collisions are always accompanied by a certain amount of radiation in the form of small - amplitude wave packets , as well as by the excitation of the kink s internal modes @xcite .",
    "the latter are responsible for several effects in the @xmath0 kink - antikink collisions .",
    "in particular , the resonant energy exchange between the translational motion of the kinks and their internal modes explains the fractal kink - antikink scattering @xcite .",
    "this is a topic that was initiated by the numerical studies in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and it is still under active investigation  @xcite .    for long time , the excitation of the soliton internal modes and the radiation losses were thought to be two major manifestations of inelasticity of the soliton collisions in nonintegrable models .",
    "however , a qualitatively different manifestation was recently identified , namely , the radiationless energy exchange ( ree ) between colliding solitons @xcite ( abbreviated as `` ree '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , a designation that we will use hereafter ) .",
    "the energy transferred to soliton internal modes in soliton collisions , for small @xmath2 , is typically proportional to @xmath3 , and the same is true for the radiation losses ( here @xmath2 is the coefficient in front of a perturbation term , added to an integrable equation ) .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath3 appear as the lowest - order correction terms in the collective variable approaches used to describe the soliton s internal modes @xcite ; the kink dynamics in the discrete @xmath0 equation @xcite ; the kink and breather dynamics in the discrete sine - gordon equation ( sge ) @xcite ; and the radiation from the discrete sge kink @xcite and from the soliton in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite . on the other hand , the degree of inelasticity due to the ree effect , when the latter is present ( see details below ) grows proportionally to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this means that for weakly perturbed integrable systems the ree effect becomes a dominant manifestation of the inelasticity of collision , while the soliton s internal modes and radiation become increasingly important with stronger deviations from integrable case .",
    "the ree effect can also be responsible for the fractal soliton scattering which was demonstrated for the first time in @xcite for the weakly perturbed sge and later for the weakly perturbed nlse @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those studies , in refs .",
    "@xcite the fractal scattering of vector solitons in the coupled nlse was attributed to the resonance energy exchange between the soliton s translational and internal modes , i.e. , through the mechanism similar to that operating for the @xmath0 kinks @xcite .",
    "fractal soliton scattering in the weakly perturbed nlse was explained qualitatively in the frame of a very simple model @xcite and for the generalized nlse in the context of a more elaborate collective variable approach @xcite , based on the method of karpman and solovev @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the soliton s internal modes were not involved into consideration in @xcite indicating that the underlying dominant mechanism for the fractal scattering was the ree effect ( rather than the internal mode excitation ) .    for weakly perturbed integrable systems , parameters of the colliding solitons where",
    "the ree effect is observed can be found from the analysis of the corresponding _ integrable _ equation .",
    "this was done for the weakly perturbed sge in @xcite and for the weakly perturbed nlse in @xcite using the fact that the ree effect is observed in the vicinity of separatrix multi - soliton solutions of the integrable equation .    in the case of moderate deviation from integrability",
    ", it becomes increasingly important to check if the degree of nonintegrability and the sign of perturbation allows for the existence of noticeable soliton internal modes before one can judge to which extent the ree effect and the soliton internal modes contribute to the inelasticity of collision ( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "ii  d in @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the ree effect in the case of a moderate degree of nonintegrability has studied far less extensively than in the case of weak perturbation , though valuable results have been recently obtained for the discrete nlse @xcite and for the generalized nlse with various types of the nonlinear term @xcite , where a general system of ordinary differential equations was derived for the velocities , amplitudes , positions and phases of the solitary waves .",
    "the latter was shown to qualitatively and quantitatively match the predictions of the full model .    in this paper",
    ", we study the ree effect in three - soliton collisions of a weakly perturbed sine - gordon equation . in the frame of the three - particle model",
    ", we demonstrate that the ree effect is directly related to a separatrix solution , and it offers a very transparent explanation of the origin of fractal soliton scattering .",
    "we also classify in a general way the potential for emergence of such phenomena in three - kink collisions of the weakly perturbed sine - gordon model .",

    "the solutions are the combinations of single - soliton solutions , namely kinks ( @xmath9 ) or antikinks ( @xmath10 ) , having the topological charges @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and two - soliton solutions , namely breathers ( @xmath13 ) , which are actually the kink - antikink oscillatory bound states .",

    "thus , among the kink s initial positions @xmath29 the only essential parameter is @xmath28 .",
    "finally , our three - kink system is defined by the topological charges of the kinks .",

    "( ii ) in the sine - gordon model the ree effect can happen only if at least three solitons collide simultaneously .",
    "energy exchange in the two - soliton collision is suppressed by the two conservation laws that remain exactly or approximately preserved in the weakly perturbed system .",
    "( iii ) the ree effect is related to the existence of the separatrix multi - soliton solutions to the integrable equations .",
    "near - separatrix motion is extremely sensitive to the perturbations @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the ree effect can be responsible for the fractal soliton scattering .",
    "the ree effect is generic and some of the above conclusions can be also extended to other nearly integrable models @xcite . for instance , the ree effect is observed in the weakly perturbed nlse already in two - soliton collisions because here each soliton has two parameters and the total number of parameters describing the two - soliton solution ( four ) exceeds the number of the remaining conservation laws . on the other hand ,",
    "the ree is _ not _ possible in the weakly perturbed kdv equation or weakly perturbed toda lattice @xcite because in these cases the soliton s cores never merge during collisions and thus , the multi - particle effects are absent .",
    "interestingly , the fractal pattern of different nature ( not related to ree ) is possible in kdv systems @xcite .",
    "the three - particle model offered in the present study can be reduced to the study of the dynamics of a particle interacting with the two - dimensional scattering potential .",

    "the fractal soliton scattering is explained by the presence of the periodic orbits of the particle in the scattering potential .",
    "periodic orbits of two types were found , each of them is responsible for a particular scenario of the particle dynamics , and each scenario yields a self - similar pattern for the collision outcome as a function of a parameter , such as the location of the central effective particle ( sec . [",
