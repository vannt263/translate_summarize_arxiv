    "the last two decades , an ever - increasing amount of research have been dedicated to understanding the electronic structure of so - called quantum dots@xcite : semiconductor structures confining from a few to several thousands electrons in spatial regions on the nanometre scale . in such calculations ,",
    "one typically seeks a few of the lowest eigenenergies @xmath0 of the system hamiltonian @xmath1 and their corresponding eigenvectors @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 one of the most popular methods is the ( full ) configuration interaction method ( ci ) , where the many - body wave function is expanded in a basis of eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , and then necessarily truncated to give an approximation . in fact , the so - called curse of dimensionality implies that the number of degrees of freedom available per particle is severely limited .",
    "it is clear , that an understanding of the properties of such basis expansions is very important , as it is necessary for _ a priori _ error estimates of the calculations .",
    "unfortunately , this is a neglected topic in the physics literature .    in this article",
    ", we give a thorough analysis of the ( full ) configuration interaction ( ci ) method using ho expansions applied to parabolic quantum dots , and give practical convergence estimates .",
    "it generalizes and refines the findings of a recent study of one - dimensional systems,@xcite and is applicable to for example nuclear systems@xcite and quantum chemical calculations@xcite as well .",
    "we demonstrate the estimates with calculations in the @xmath4 dimensional case for @xmath5 electrons , paralleling computations in the literature@xcite .",
    "the main results are however somewhat discouraging .",
    "the expansion coefficients of typical eigenfunctions are shown to decay very slowly , limiting the accuracy of _ any _ practical method using ho basis functions .",
    "we therefore propose to use an effective two - body interaction to overcome , at least partially , the slow convergence rate .",
    "this is routinely used in nuclear physics@xcite where the inter - particle forces are of a completely different , and basically unknown , nature . for electronic systems , however , the interaction is well - known and simpler to analyze , but effective interactions of the present kind have not been applied , at least to the author s knowledge .",
    "the modified method is seen to have convergence rates of at least one order of magnitude higher than the original ci method .",
    "an important point here is that the complexity of the ci calculations is not altered , as no extra non - zero matrix elements are introduced .",
    "all one needs is a relatively simple one - time calculation to produce the effective interaction matrix elements .",
    "the ho eigenfunctions are popular for several reasons .",
    "many quantum systems , such as the quantum dot model considered here , are perturbed harmonic oscillators _ per se _ , so that the true eigenstates should be perturbations of the ho states .",
    "moreover , the ho has many beautiful properties , such as complete separability of the hamiltonian , invariance under orthogonal coordinate changes , and thus easily computed eigenfunctions , so that computing matrix elements of relevant operators becomes relatively simple .",
    "the ho eigenfunctions are defined on the _ whole _ of @xmath6 in which the particles live , so that truncation of the domain is unnecessary .",
    "indeed , this is one of the main problems with methods such as finite difference or finite element methods.@xcite on the other hand , the ho eigenfunctions are the _ only _ basis functions with all these properties .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we discuss the harmonic oscillator and the the parabolic quantum dot model , including exact solutions for the @xmath7 case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : series - new ] , we give results for the approximation properties of the hermite functions in @xmath8 dimensions , and thus also of many - body ho eigenfunctions . by approximation properties ,",
    "we mean estimates on the error @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is any wave function and @xmath11 projects onto a finite subspace of ho eigenfunctions , i.e. , the model space . here , @xmath12 is in fact the best approximation in the norm .",
    "the estimates will depend on analytic properties of @xmath10 , i.e. , whether it is differentiable , and whether it falls of sufficiently fast at infinity . to our knowledge , these results are not previously published .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ci ] , we discuss the full configuration interaction method , using the results obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : series - new ] to obtain convergence estimates of the method as function of the model space size .",
    "we also briefly discuss the effective interaction utilized in the numerical calculations , which are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : numeric ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results , its consequences , and an outlook on further directions of research in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we have also included an appendix with proofs of the formal propositions in sec .",
    "[ sec : series - new ] .",
    "[ sec : model ]      a spinless particle of mass @xmath13 in an isotropic harmonic potential has hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the particle s coordinates . by choosing proper energy and length units ,",

    "these are defined by @xmath25 where the hermite polynomials @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 the hermite polynomials also obey the recurrence formula @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the hermite polynomial @xmath26 has @xmath8 zeroes , and the gaussian factor in @xmath31 will eventually subvert the polynomial for large @xmath32 .",
    "thus , qualitatively , the hermite functions can be described as localized oscillations with @xmath8 nodes and a gaussian `` tail '' as @xmath33 approaches @xmath34 .",
    "one can easily compute the quantum mechanical variance @xmath35 showing that , loosely speaking , the width of the oscillatory region increases as @xmath36 .",
    "the functions @xmath37 defined in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : hermite ] ) are called @xmath20-dimensional hermite functions . in the sequel",
    ", we will define @xmath38 for a tuple of non - negative integers , also called a multi - index ; see appendix [ sec : multi - indices ]",
    ". using multi - indices , we may write @xmath39    the eigenvalue of @xmath31 is @xmath40 , so that the eigenvalue of @xmath41 is @xmath42 i.e. , a zero - point energy @xmath43 plus a non - negative integer .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 the _ shell number _ of @xmath45 , and the eigenspace @xmath46 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath47 a _",
    "shell_. we define the _ shell - truncated hilbert space _ @xmath48 as @xmath49 i.e. , the subspace spanned by all hermite functions with shell number less than or equal to @xmath50 , or , equivalently , the direct sum of the shells up to and including @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51-body generalization of this space , to be discussed in section [ sec : many - body - wave - func ] , is a very common model space used in ci calculations .    since the hermite functions constitute an orthonormal basis for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , in the sense that for every @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where @xmath11 is the orthogonal projector on @xmath56 . strictly speaking",
    ", we should use a symbol like @xmath57 or even @xmath58 for the projector .",
    "however , @xmath50 and @xmath20 will always be clear from the context , so we are deliberately sloppy to obtain a concise formulation .",
    "for the same reason , we will sometimes simply write @xmath59 or @xmath60 for the space @xmath56 .",
    "an important fact is that since @xmath61 is invariant under orthogonal spatial transformations ( i.e. , such transformation conserve energy ) , so is each individual shell space .",
    "hence , each shell @xmath46 , and also @xmath56 , is independent of the spatial coordinates chosen .    for the case @xmath62 each shell @xmath63",
    "is spanned by a single eigenfunction , namely @xmath64 . for @xmath4 , each shell",
    "@xmath63 has degeneracy @xmath65 , with eigenfunctions @xmath66    the usual ho eigenfunctions used to construct many - body wave functions are not the hermite functions @xmath37 , however , but rather those obtained by utilizing the spherical symmetry of the ho .",
    "this gives a many - body basis diagonal in angular momentum .",
    "for @xmath4 we obtain the so - called fock - darwin orbitals given by @xmath67^{1/2}\\frac{e^{im\\theta}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } } l_n^{|m|}(r^2)e^{-r^2/2}. \\label{eq : fock - darwin}\\ ] ] here , @xmath68 is the nodal quantum number , counting the nodes of the radial part , and @xmath13 is the azimuthal quantum number .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath69 thus , @xmath70 is the shell number . by construction ,",
    "the fock - darwin orbitals are eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator @xmath71 with eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "of course , we may write @xmath72 as a linear combination of the hermite functions @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , and vice versa . the actual choice of form of eigenfunctions is immaterial , as long as we may identify those belonging to a given shell .",
    "the space @xmath75 is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : shells ] using both hermite functions and fock - darwin orbitals .",
    "we consider @xmath51 electrons confined in a harmonic oscillator in @xmath20 dimensions .",
    "this is a very common model for a quantum dot .",
    "we comment , that modelling the quantum dot geometry by a perturbed harmonic oscillator is justified by self - consistent calculations,@xcite and is a widely adopted assumption.@xcite    the hamiltonian of the quantum dot is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the many - body ho hamiltonian , given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the inter - electron coulomb interactions . in dimensionless units",
    "the interaction is given by , @xmath80 the @xmath51 electrons have coordinates @xmath81 , and the parameter @xmath82 measures the strength of the interaction over the confinement of the ho , viz , @xmath83 where we recall that @xmath17 is the length unit .",
    "typical values for gaas semiconductors are close to @xmath84 , see for example ref .  .",
    "increasing the trap size leads to a larger @xmath82 , and the quantum dot then approaches the classical regime.@xcite      before we discuss the approximation properties of the hermite functions , it is instructive to consider the very simplest example of a two - electron parabolic quantum dot and the properties of the eigenfunctions , since this case admits analytical solutions for special values of @xmath82 and is otherwise well understood@xcite . here",
    ", we consider @xmath4 dimensions only , but the @xmath85 case is similar .",
    "we note , that for @xmath7 it is enough to study the spatial wave function , since it must be either symmetric ( for the singlet @xmath86 spin state ) or anti - symmetric ( for the triplet @xmath87 spin states ) .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "introduce a set of scaled centre of mass coordinates given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this coordinate change is orthogonal and symmetric in @xmath93 .",
    "this leads to the separable hamiltonian @xmath94 a complete set of eigenfunctions of @xmath1 can now be written on product form , viz , @xmath95 the relative coordinate wave function @xmath96 is an eigenfunction of the relative coordinate hamiltonian given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "this hamiltonian can be further separated using polar coordinates , yielding eigenfunctions on the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 is an integer and @xmath101 is an eigenfunction of the radial hamiltonian given by @xmath102 by convention , @xmath8 counts the nodes away from @xmath103 of @xmath104 . moreover ,",
    "odd ( even ) @xmath13 gives anti - symmetric ( symmetric ) wave functions @xmath105 . for any given @xmath106",
    ", it is quite easy to deduce that the special value @xmath107 yields the eigenfunction @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are constants .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath111 is @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the ground state ( having @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) for @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 with @xmath109 being a ( new ) normalization constant .",
    "observe that this function has a cusp at @xmath103 , i.e. , at the origin @xmath118 ( where we have introduced cartesian coordinates @xmath119 for the relative coordinate ) . indeed",
    ", the partial derivatives @xmath120 and @xmath121 are not continuous there , and @xmath122 has no partial derivatives ( in the distributional sense , see appendix [ sec : sobolev ] ) of second order .",
    "the cusp stems from the famous `` cusp condition '' which in simple terms states that , for a non - vanishing wave function at @xmath123 , the coulomb divergence must be compensated by a similar divergence in the laplacian.@xcite this is only possible if the wave function has a cusp .    on the other hand ,",
    "the non - smooth function @xmath124 is to be expanded in the ho eigenfunctions , e.g. , fock - darwin orbitals .",
    "( recall , that the particular representation for the ho eigenfunctions are immaterial  also whether we use lab coordinates @xmath125 or centre - of - mass coordinates @xmath126 and @xmath127 , since the coordinate change is orthogonal . ) for @xmath128 , we have @xmath129 using the fact that these are independent of @xmath130 .",
    "thus , @xmath131 the functions @xmath132 are very smooth , as is seen by noting that @xmath133 is a polynomial in @xmath33 and @xmath134 , while @xmath135 , so eqn",
    ".   is basically approximating a square root with a polynomial .",
    "consider then a truncated expansion @xmath136 , such as the one obtained with the ci or coupled cluster method.@xcite in general , this is different from @xmath137 , which is the best approximation of the wave function in @xmath138 . in any case , this expansion , consisting of the @xmath139 terms like those of eqn",
    ".   is a very smooth function .",
    "therefore , the cusp at @xmath103 can not be well approximated .    in section [ sec:2d - app ]",
    ", we will show that the smoothness properties of the wave function @xmath140 is equivalent to a certain decay rate of the coefficients @xmath141 in eqn .   as @xmath142 .",
    "in this case , we will show that @xmath143 so that @xmath144 here , @xmath145 is the number of times @xmath140 may be differentiated weakly , i.e. , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 is a constant . for the function",
    "@xmath122 we have @xmath148 .",
    "this kind of estimate directly tells us that an approximation using only a few ho eigenfunctions necessarily will give an error depending directly on the smoothness @xmath145 .",
    "we comment , that for higher @xmath106 the eigenstates will still have cusps , albeit in the higher derivatives.@xcite indeed , we have weak derivatives of order @xmath149 , as can easily be deduced by operating on @xmath150 with @xmath151 and @xmath152 . moreover ,",
    "recall that @xmath153 is the @xmath87 ground state , which then will have coefficients decaying faster than the @xmath86 ground state .",
    "moreover , there will be excited states , i.e. , states with @xmath154 , that also have more quickly decaying coefficients @xmath155 .",
    "this will be demonstrated numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec : numeric ] .",
    "in fact , hoffmann - ostenhof _ _ et al.__@xcite have shown that near @xmath123 , for arbitrary @xmath82 _ any _ local solution @xmath140 of @xmath156 has the form @xmath157 where @xmath158 , and where @xmath11 , @xmath159 , is a hyper - spherical harmonic ( on @xmath160 ) , and where @xmath110 is a constant .",
    "this also generalizes to arbitrary @xmath51 , cf .  sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic - props ] . from this representation , it is manifest , that @xmath161 , i.e. , @xmath140 has weak derivatives of order @xmath162 .",

    "[ sec : analytic - props ] .",
    "[ sec : series - new ]      in this section , we consider some formal mathematical propositions whose proofs are given in appendix [ app : proofs ] , and discuss their importance for expansions in ho basis functions .",
    "the first proposition considers the one - dimensional case , and the second considers general , multidimensional expansions .",
    "the latter result has to the author s knowledge not been published previously .",
    "the treatment for one - dimensional hermite functions is similar , but not equivalent to , that given by boyd@xcite and hille.@xcite    we stress that the results are valid for _ any _ given wavefunction  not only eigenfunctions of quantum dot hamiltonians  assuming only that the wavefunction decays exponentially as @xmath163 . in appendix [ app :",
    "proofs ] , more general conditions are also considered .",
    "the results are stated in terms of _ weak _ differentiability of the wavefunction , which is a generalization of the classical notion of a derivative .",
    "the space @xmath164 is roughly defined as the ( square integrable ) functions @xmath165 having @xmath145 ( square integrable ) derivatives @xmath166 , @xmath167 . correspondingly , the space @xmath168 consists of the functions whose partial derivatives of total order @xmath169 are square integrable . for wavefunctions of electronic systems",
    ", it turns out that @xmath145 times continuous differentiability implies @xmath170 times weak differentiability@xcite .",
    "the order @xmath145 of differentiability is not always known , but an upper or lower bound can often be found through analysis .",
    "it is however important , that the coulomb singularity implies that @xmath145 is finite .",
    "for the one - dimensional case , we have the following proposition :    [ prop : approx1b ] let @xmath171 be a given integer .",
    "let @xmath172 be exponentially decaying as @xmath163 and given by @xmath173 where @xmath31 is given by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : hermite1 ] ) . then @xmath174 if and only if @xmath175    we notice that the latter implies that @xmath176 which shows that the more @xmath165 can be differentiated , the faster the coefficients will fall off as @xmath142 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath177 .",
    "then @xmath178 which gives an estimate of how well a finite basis of hermite functions will approximate @xmath165 in the norm .",
    "we already notice , that for low @xmath179 , which is typical , the coefficients fall off as @xmath180 , which is rather slowly .",
    "in the general @xmath8-dimensional case , the wavefunction @xmath181 has an expansion in the @xmath8-dimensional hermite functions @xmath182 , @xmath183 given by @xmath184 in order to obtain useful estimates on the error , we need to define the _ shell - weight _ @xmath185 by the overlap of @xmath165 with the single shell @xmath186 , i.e. , @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the projection onto the shell .",
    "thus , @xmath189 for the one - dimensional case , we of course have @xmath190 .",
    "[ prop : approx - general - n ] let @xmath191 be exponentially decaying as @xmath192 and given by @xmath193 then @xmath194 if and only if @xmath195    again , we notice that the latter implies that @xmath196 moreover , for the shell - truncated hilbert space @xmath60 , the approximation error is given by @xmath197    in applications , we often observe a decay of non - integral order , i.e. , there exists an @xmath147 such that we observe @xmath198 this does not , of course , contradict the results . to see this , we observe that if @xmath194 but @xmath199 , then @xmath200 must decay at least as fast as @xmath201 but not as fast as @xmath202 .",
    "thus , the actual decay exponent can be anything inside the interval @xmath203 .",
    "consider also the case where @xmath194 for every @xmath145 , i.e. , we can differentiate it ( weakly ) as many times we like .",
    "then @xmath200 decays faster than @xmath204 , for any @xmath205 , giving so - called exponential convergence of the hermite series .",
    "hence , functions that are best approximated by hermite series are rapidly decaying _ and _ very smooth functions @xmath10 .",
    "this would be the case for the quantum dot eigenfunctions if the inter - particle interactions were non - singular .",
    "we now discuss @xmath51-body eigenfunctions of the ho in @xmath20 dimensions , including spin , showing that we may identify the expansion of a such with @xmath206 expansions in hermite functions in @xmath207 dimensions , i.e. , @xmath206 expansions in ho eigenfunctions of imagined spinless particles in @xmath207 dimensions .",
