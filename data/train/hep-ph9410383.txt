    "the discovery of an anomalous suppression in the first moment of the polarised proton structure function @xmath3 by the emc collaboration@xcite in 1988 stimulated a period of intense theoretical and experimental activity in the qcd community .",
    "recently , the existence of this so - called ` proton spin problem ' has been confirmed by new experiments at cern@xcite and slac@xcite , although the numerical results have been substantially revised .    in this contribution , i will review some recent work@xcite with s. narison and g. veneziano which we believe gives a theoretically convincing and quantitative resolution of the problem . in our picture@xcite ,",
    "the ` proton spin ' effect is seen as a natural addition to the class of ozi - violating @xmath6 phenomena characteristic of qcd in the flavour singlet pseudoscalar ( or pseudovector ) channel . furthermore , the violation of the ellis - jaffe sum rule , due to the suppression relative to the ozi expectation of the singlet form factor @xmath7 ( usually denoted by @xmath8 ) , is recognised as a generic , target - independent feature of qcd related to the axial @xmath6 anomaly and not as a special property of the proton structure .",
    "in fact , it reflects an anomalous suppression of the first moment of the qcd topological susceptibility , @xmath2 .",
    "the sum rule for the first moment of the polarised proton structure function @xmath3 reads : @xmath9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath10 are form factors in the proton matrix elements of the axial current : @xmath11 and @xmath12 is an @xmath13 flavour index . here",
    ", we just display the perturbative corrections to @xmath14 . for further terms , see @xcite .",
    "since our results depend smoothly on the quark masses in the chiral limit , we set the light quark masses to zero .",
    "the interpretation of these form factors in the naive parton model is , in standard notation : @xmath15    the axial current occurs here since it is the lowest twist , lowest spin , odd - parity operator in the ope of two electromagnetic currents ( see sect.4 ) .",
    "the suffix @xmath16 emphasises that the current is the renormalised composite operator . under renormalisation ,",
    "the gluon topological density @xmath17 and the divergence of the flavour singlet axial current @xmath18 mix as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 and we have quoted the formulae for @xmath22 flavours .",
    "the mixing is such that the combination occurring in the axial anomaly ward identities , e.g. @xmath23 is not renormalised .",
    "since @xmath18 is renormalised , its matrix elements satisfy renormalisation group equations with an anomalous dimension @xmath24 , so that in particular @xmath7 depends on the rg scale , set to @xmath25 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "we emphasise that @xmath7 does _ not _ , as was initially supposed , measure the spin of the quark constituents of the proton .",
    "the rg non - invariance of @xmath26 , which is a consequence of the anomaly , means that it is _ not _ a conserved current . only in the idealised case of a free dirac field",
    "do the matrix elements of @xmath27 and spin coincide .    to compare the sum rule with experiment , we use the following standard results : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 as fitted from hyperon and beta decays . we also take @xmath31 from tau decay data .",
    "the ellis - jaffe sum rule is obtained by assuming that , in parton language , the strange quark polarisation in the proton vanishes , i.e. @xmath32 in eq.(3 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the ozi prediction @xmath33 and corresponds to @xmath34    in contrast , our result @xmath35 leads to @xmath36    we can also compare with the lowest order expectation in the skyrme model@xcite , according to which the proton decouples from the flavour singlet pseudoscalar channel ( @xmath37 in the language of sect.4 ) so that @xmath38 and @xmath39    these theoretical expectations are compared with the experimental data in fig.1 . the original emc result was@xcite @xmath40 which , with the above values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , allows the following value of @xmath7 to be extracted : @xmath43    clearly , this value is barely consistent with our prediction .",
    "it is therefore extremely gratifying that the improved analysis by the smc collaboration quoted in @xcite now gives the new ` world average ' @xmath44 from which we deduce @xmath45 notwithstanding the large experimental errors , the agreement between the new data and our prediction is excellent .",
    "the essential features of our method are easily described for a general deep inelastic scattering process .",
    "the hadronic part of the scattering amplitude is given by the imaginary part of the two - current matrix element @xmath46 .",
    "the ope is used to expand the large @xmath25 limit of the product of currents as a sum of wilson coefficients @xmath47 times renormalised composite operators @xmath48 as follows ( suppressing lorentz indices ) , @xmath49 the dominant contributions to the amplitude arise from the operators @xmath48 of lowest twist . within this set of lowest twist operators , those of spin @xmath50 contribute to the @xmath50th moment of the structure functions , i.e. @xmath51    the wilson coefficients are calculable in qcd perturbation theory",
    ", so the problem reduces to evaluating the target matrix elements of the corresponding operators .",
    "we now introduce appropriately defined proper vertices @xmath52 , which are chosen to be 1pi with respect to a physically motivated basis set @xmath53 of renormalised composite operators .",
    "the matrix elements are then decomposed into products of these vertices with zero - momentum composite operator propagators as follows , @xmath54 despite being non - perturbative , we can frequently evaluate the composite operator propagators using a combination of exact ward identities and dynamical approximations .",
    "all this is illustrated in @xcite .",
    "in essence , what we have done is to split the whole amplitude into the product of a ` hot qcd ' ( high momentum ) part described by qcd perturbation theory , a ` cold qcd ' part described by a ( non - perturbative , zero - momentum ) composite operator propagator and finally a target - dependent proper vertex .",
    "the generic expression for a structure function sum rule is then : @xmath55    all the target dependence is contained in the vertex function @xmath52 .",
    "however , these are not unique  they depend on the choice of the basis @xmath53 of composite operators .",
    "this choice is made on physical grounds based on the relevant degrees of freedom , the aim being to parametrise the amplitude in terms of a minimal , but sufficient , set of vertex functions .",
    "( these play the rle of the non - perturbative parton distributions in the usual treatment ) .",
    "a good choice can often lead to an almost direct correspondence between the proper vertices and physical couplings such as , e.g. , the pion - nucleon coupling @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , the proper vertices should be chosen whenever possible to be rg invariant .",
    "it is important to realise that the decomposition ( 17 ) is an _ exact _",
    "expression , independent of the choice of the set of operators @xmath53 . a different choice of basis set merely changes the definition of the proper vertices .",
    "in particular , it is _ not _ to be understood that the set @xmath53 is in any sense a complete set and that choosing a finite number of operators ( such as the pseudoscalars @xmath57 and @xmath17 in sect.4 ) represents an approximation .",
    "we now apply this method to the sum rule for @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant ope is : @xmath58 assuming the absence of a massless pseudoscalar ( goldstone ) boson in the @xmath6 channel , we find @xmath59 where we have used the anomalous chiral ward identity to re - express @xmath60 as the forward matrix element of the renormalised gluon topological density @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath61 is the proton mass .",
    "we now choose the composite operator basis @xmath53 to be the set of renormalised flavour singlet pseudoscalar operators @xmath17 and @xmath57 , where , up to a subtle but crucial normalisation factor ( see @xcite and @xcite for an explanation ) , the corresponding bare operator is simply @xmath62 .",
    "we may then write ( c.f .",
    "eq.(17 ) ) : @xmath63 where the composite operator propagators are at zero momentum and the proper vertices are 1pi with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath57 only .",
    "the composite operator propagator in the first term in eq.(21 ) is the zero - momentum limit of an important quantity in qcd known as the topological susceptibility @xmath64 , viz .",
    "@xmath65 moreover , it can be shown exactly using chiral ward identities@xcite that the propagator @xmath66 at zero momentum is simply the square root of the first moment of the topological susceptibility .",
    "we therefore find : @xmath67    the chiral ward identities also show that for qcd with massless quarks , @xmath68 actually vanishes .",
    "this is in contrast to pure yang - mills theory , where @xmath68 is non - zero .",
    "we therefore arrive at our basic result@xcite : @xmath69    the quantity @xmath1 is not rg invariant and scales with the anomalous dimension @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "the proper vertex has been chosen specifically so as to be rg invariant .",
    "the renormalisation group properties of this decomposition are crucial to our resolution of the ` proton spin problem ' .",
    "our proposal is that we should expect the source of ozi violations to lie in rg non - invariant terms , i.e. in @xmath70 .",
    "the reasoning is as follows . in the absence of the @xmath6 anomaly",
    ", the ozi rule would be an exact property of qcd .",
    "so the ozi violation is a consequence of the anomaly .",
    "but it is the existence of the anomaly that is responsible for the non - conservation and hence non - trivial renormalisation of the axial current @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore expect to find ozi violations in quantities sensitive to the anomaly , which we identify through their rg dependence on the anomalous dimension @xmath24 .",
    "this seems reasonable since , if the ozi rule were to be good for such quantities , it would mean approximating a rg non - invariant , scale - dependent quantity by a scale - independent one .    notice that we are _ not _ saying that the ozi violation is due to a large ( non - perturbative ) scaling effect dependent on @xmath24 .",
    "we are simply using the dependence on the anomalous dimension to identify those quantities most likely to display significant differences from their ozi approximations .",
    "if this proposal is correct , we expect @xmath71 to be significantly suppressed relative to its ozi approximation of @xmath72 .",
    "the proper vertex @xmath73 would behave exactly as expected according to the ozi rule .",
    "that is , the ellis - jaffe violating suppression of the first moment of @xmath3 observed by emc would _ not _ be a special property of the proton at all , but would simply be due to an anomalously small value of the first moment of the qcd topological susceptibility @xmath70 .",
    "this is our conjectured resolution@xcite of the ` proton spin problem ' .",
    "it is further supported by a number of experimental results in the pseudoscalar @xmath6 channel , notably in @xmath74 decays .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion",
    ".    putting all this together , we conjecture the following expression for the singlet form factor : @xmath75",
    "the remaining task is to find a non - perturbative estimate of the first moment of the topological susceptibility , @xmath2 .",
    "this is a fundamental quantity likely to reappear in many applications of qcd , and an evaluation from first principles represents a strong challenge to lattice gauge theory .",
    "of course , for a meaningful result it is necessary to work beyond the quenched approximation , close to the chiral limit .    instead",
    ", we estimate @xmath2 using qcd spectral sum rules .",
    "a full description of the calculation is given in @xcite and here we only quote the result . we have evaluated @xmath2 using subtracted dispersion relations with the laplace sum rule method , finding good stability , and have confirmed the result using the finite energy sum rule technique .",
    "the spectral function is saturated with the single lightest pseudoscalar state , the @xmath76 .",
    "we find @xmath77 a suppression of approx .",
    "@xmath78 relative to the ozi value @xmath79 .",
    "substituting this into eq.(25 ) finally gives our result ( 9 ) for @xmath7 .",
    "the essential input parameter in the spectral sum rules is the @xmath76 mass .",
    "( a quite different result is found for @xmath2 in pure yang - mills theory , saturating the spectral function with a pseudoscalar glueball . ) in essence , the sum rules allow us to determine the relevant mass scale for ozi breaking in the pseudovector channel using as input the known ozi - violating @xmath76 mass from the pseudoscalar channel .",
    "the link is the @xmath6 goldberger - treiman relation@xcite which underlies our approach .",
    "our conclusions are simply stated .",
    "@xmath8 does _ not _ measure spin .",
    "its suppression relative to the ozi ( ellis - jaffe ) value is due to an anomalously small value of @xmath2 in qcd and is _ not _ a special property of the proton .",
    "the violation of the ellis - jaffe sum rule is _ not _ a problem in qcd  the flavour singlet pseudovector channel is precisely where we should expect to find large ozi violations and , using spectral sum rules , we have given a successful quantitative prediction of @xmath8 and @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath3 sum rule does , however , present some problems for qcd - inspired models of the proton .",
    "the skyrme model would have to be significantly extended to incorporate the @xmath81 effects characteristic of the @xmath6 anomaly . in the parton model , the effect can be incorporated ( though not as yet predicted ) by modifying the constituent quark expression ( 3 ) for @xmath8 to include a polarised gluon density @xmath82 with the necessary renormalisation group behaviour . for further details of this approach , see @xcite .",
