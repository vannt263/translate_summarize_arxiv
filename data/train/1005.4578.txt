    "one of the most frequently studied extensions of the standard model ( sm ) is an additional @xmath4 symmetry and its associated @xmath0 boson @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath4 charges are family universal in most of the models discussed in the literature , this need not be the case .",
    "it is well known that a non - universal @xmath0 induces tree - level fcnc which are severely constrained by experiment , most notably meson mixing . the contribution of these fcnc to many processes has been studied in detail in the literature , and generally it has been found that the most severe constraints arise from @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 meson mixing @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is a class of models , with a down - quark mass matrix of the georgi - jarlskog form @xcite , in which the fcnc in the down - type quark sector vanish or are strongly suppressed .",
    "these models then satisfy all the existing experimental constraints on the induced fcnc .",
    "interestingly , they also predict that the largest fcnc occurs in the @xmath9 transition with a strength comparable to @xmath10 .",
    "similarly in these models , the strength of the @xmath2 coupling can be comparable to @xmath11 .",
    "the lhc will serve as a top factory and will thus provide an ideal environment to study this possibility . there",
    "exist many studies on @xmath12 flavor changing transitions at the lhc @xcite , but for the most part they assume that the transition will show up as a non - standard top - quark decay .",
    "this is what happens in scenarios with anomalous @xmath13 couplings .",
    "however , rare top - quark decay does not produce significant constraints for @xmath14 couplings , since the @xmath0 is required phenomenologically to be heavier than the top - quark @xcite . a suitable alternative to cover this case",
    "is to observe the fcnc via single top - quark production .",
    "a possibility that has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is the production of @xmath15 and @xmath16 final states from on - shell @xmath0 production using the largest @xmath14 coupling allowed by @xmath17 mixing .",
    "this procedure suffers from two drawbacks .",
    "first , the cross - section depends not only on the fcnc transition but also on the flavor diagonal couplings of the @xmath0 to light quarks .",
    "this feature makes the predictions very model dependent , a problem that has been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite by surveying a large range of models .",
    "second , it appears that the signal will be very difficult to separate from background at the lhc .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a different process , @xmath18 , in which the @xmath0 is produced in association with a single top - quark via a fcnc transition .",
    "this process has a smaller cross - section than the one discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it also has significantly lower background .",
    "it can also be described in a more model independent way as we will show .",
    "the relevant cross - sections for this process are sufficiently small that experimental studies of this type will not happen early in the lhc program , but rather after a @xmath0 has been discovered and integrated luminosities of several hundred fb@xmath3 have been collected .",
    "for this reason we only present numerics for @xmath19  tev .",
    "our aim is to produce a phenomenological study of @xmath0 fcnc couplings to the top quark at the lhc in a model independent manner .",
    "the necessary input to this end consists of the fcnc @xmath0 couplings which we simply parametrize as @xmath20    the @xmath0 boson is assumed to be heavier than the top - quark , in keeping with available experimental constraints @xcite . in this scenario , rare top - quark decays mediated by a @xmath0 fcnc are very much suppressed and do not play an important role in constraining the couplings in eq .",
    "[ zpcoup ] @xcite .",
    "fcnc couplings as in eq .",
    "[ zpcoup ] arise in models with non - universal @xmath0 couplings and are generally unknown .",
    "typically they are accompanied by corresponding fcnc couplings in the down - quark sector that are severely constrained by meson mixing and rare meson decay observations . ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out a mechanism to suppress these fcnc in the down - quark sector to phenomenologically acceptable levels which results in specific predictions for the couplings in eq .",
    "[ zpcoup ] .",
    "for example , for right handed couplings , @xmath21 in ref .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it is assumed that the fcnc couplings are left handed and they are directly constrained by @xmath17 mixing resulting in similar numbers , @xmath22 these numbers represent a benchmark of sensitivity to fcnc needed to be competitive with existing indirect constraints .",
    "the production cross - section for the process we discuss in this paper , @xmath23 , depends only on sm parameters , the couplings in eq .",
    "[ zpcoup ] , and the @xmath0 mass .",
    "additional model dependence arises in the different flavor diagonal couplings of the @xmath0 . in our process",
    ", these additional couplings enter only to determine the final states ( and their corresponding branching ratio ) in which the @xmath0 is observed . to keep our study as model independent as possible we simply present our results in terms of these branching ratios .",
    "we now discuss single top quark production in association with the @xmath0 , @xmath24 , at the lhc . in models with non - universal @xmath0 bosons that result in fcnc , the flavor diagonal couplings of the @xmath0 to the third generation are usually preferred . with this in mind",
    "we consider several possibilities for the observation of the @xmath0 in this channel .",
    "our first scenario , that will serve as a benchmark for the feasibility of these studies , will assume that the @xmath0 decays into muon pairs with non - negligible branching ratio @xmath25 . to allow for the possibility of enhanced branching ratios to third generation fermions we next consider @xmath0 decays into tau - lepton pairs with non - negligible branching ratio @xmath26 . finally , to include the possibility of a leptophobic @xmath0 we also discuss the cases in which the @xmath0 decays into @xmath27 or @xmath28 pairs with non - negligible branching ratio .    in order to gain some insight into the numerology involved , we first consider @xmath29 disregarding background and identification efficiencies .",
    "we use madgraph @xcite and check our results with comphep @xcite for this preliminary calculation by implementing the new couplings of eq .",
    "[ zpcoup ] into both programs .",
    "the signal arises from the parton subprocesses @xmath30 or @xmath31 ( or those with @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 ) for the @xmath34 or @xmath35 couplings respectively .",
    "furthermore , since there is no interference between the new couplings and any standard model process , the resulting cross - sections are quadratic in the new couplings and identical for the left and right handed cases .",
    "the @xmath36 couplings are expected to be smaller than the @xmath37 in both the cases discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite by about an order of magnitude as seen in eqs .",
    "[ expsizer ] ,  [ expsizel ] .",
    "this , however , is compensated by the larger up - quark parton distribution functions that enter the @xmath31 process . using the cteq-6l1 parton distribution functions , @xmath38  tev , and @xmath39  gev we obtain the following raw cross - sections for two values of the @xmath0 mass : @xmath40 and identical numbers for right handed couplings with @xmath41 replacing @xmath42 .",
    "these cross - sections can be turned into a rough lower bound for the fcnc that would be observable at lhc by arbitrarily demanding a signal yield of 10 events for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath43 .",
    "the resulting numbers are shown in table  [ tabrough ] .",
    ".lowest value of the respective fcnc coupling ( @xmath44 ) that produces 10 @xmath45 events at lhc with 100 fb@xmath3 for a given @xmath46 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ t : prelimc ] shows the results before any cuts are applied whereas table  [ t : finalc ] presents the corresponding numbers after all the cuts have been applied .",
    "all bounds are obtained assuming a 100% branching ratio @xmath47 for the @xmath0 to decay to the corresponding mode .",
    "the numbers in the tables thus scale with @xmath48",
    ". the salient features of these tables are :    a.   the difference between the numbers in the @xmath49 row in table  [ t : prelimc ] and the preliminary numbers in table  [ tabrough ] simply reflects the decrease in statistics from the requirement of identifying the top through its semileptonic decay ( to @xmath50 ) . b.   similarly , the worsening in the limits in going to the @xmath51 and/or the @xmath52 modes simply reflects the additional loss of statistics from the two @xmath53 branching ratios . in this sense",
    "the numbers in the table are very conservative as we have chosen only the cleanest decay mode for both the @xmath54-lepton and top - quark cases .",
    "for example , we could assume instead that taus can be tagged with identification efficiency ( @xmath55 ) as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the limits from @xmath56 can be improved by a factor of 3 or so . c.   the background can be essentially eliminated with the sets of cuts we suggest and the loss in signal sensitivity is relatively small ( factors of 2 - 3 ) , as can be seen by comparing tables  [ t : prelimc ]  and  [ t : finalc ] .",
    "this result is encouraging although additional studies at the detector level are still needed .",
    "tables  [ t : prelimc ]  and  [ t : finalc ] illustrate the sensitivity limits for two values of @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding limits as a function of @xmath46 are presented in figures  [ f : gmm ] , [ f : gll ] , [ f : gbb ] , and [ f : gtt ] for the case of @xmath57 and @xmath58 couplings for four different decay modes of the @xmath0 .",
    "there is one additional background that we have not mentioned because it is due to the new physics itself .",
    "flavor diagonal couplings of a non - universal @xmath0 can give rise to the same final state we considered in this paper .",
    "an example is single top production in the @xmath59 channel followed by a flavor diagonal @xmath0 coupling to top as studied in ref .",
    "this particular background is model dependent and could be large for models in which the @xmath60 couplings are very large @xcite .",
    "however , being due to the new particle itself , it is something to study after discovery of a @xmath0 as also suggested in ref .",
    "we have studied the bounds that can be placed by the lhc on flavor changing couplings of a new @xmath0 boson to top - charm quarks or top - up quarks using the single top production in association with the @xmath0 process .",
    "we have first presented preliminary results derived from counting the number of @xmath61 events .",
    "these results indicate that integrated luminosities of a few hundred fb@xmath3 at 14  tev are needed to reach the interesting region of parameter space vis - a - vis low energy constraints on fcnc and in particular @xmath17 mixing .",
    "we have then extended our study to make it more realistic by considering the effects of sm background . to this end",
    "we looked for sm events with the same topologies as the signal events in four different decay channels of the @xmath0 ( to @xmath62 ) and used appropriate cuts to reduce or eliminate the background .",
    "at this level of analysis we found that it is possible to manage these backgrounds at a modest cost to the signal .",
    "our analysis for the @xmath54-lepton and top - quark modes is overly conservative as we assumed they could only be identified in the semileptonic ( to muons ) mode .",
    "improvements on this would drive the region that can be probed towards the ideal region shown in figure  [ f : prelim ] .        for a recent review see p.  langacker , rev .",
