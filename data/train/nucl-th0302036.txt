    "earlier [ 1,2 ] the charge - exchange breakup of a fast deuteron into two protons @xmath10 was investigated in the framework of the impulse approach . in this process the neutron incorporated in the deuteron is converted into the proton as a result of the charge transfer reaction @xmath11 at the momentum @xmath12 . in so doing , it was supposed that the target particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the unit charge difference are the members of the same isomultiplet . in particular , one can consider the process @xmath15 taking place at a collision of a fast deuteron with a proton target .    in papers [ 1,2 ] only the case of unpolarized initial particles was considered . in so doing , the interaction between the final protons was not taken into account and thus the spectrum of proton relative momenta was determined incorrectly . in paper",
    "[ 3 ] , a more detailed analysis of the problem has been carried out , taking into account the polarization parameters of the particles , the identity of the produced protons ( fermi - statistics effect ) and the coulomb and strong interactions in the final state . the latter was however treated in an approximate way with the accuracy of some tens percent .",
    "here we calculate this effect on a percent level based on the exact solution of the schroedinger equation .",
    "we also calculate the influence of the d - wave state in the deuteron wave function on the proton spectrum and polarization effects in the forward charge - exchange deuteron breakup .",
    "the impulse approach to the deuteron breakup is applicable , in any case , for relativistic energies guaranteeing validity of the condition [ 3 ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the velocity of the projectile deuteron , @xmath18 is the binding energy of the nucleons in the deuteron , @xmath19 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the duration of the collision is then much smaller than the characteristic period of the motion of the nucleons in the deuteron and , as a result , the neutron and the proton have practically no time to change their coordinates during the impact .    when the neutron , at the transition into the proton , gets the nonrelativistic momentum transfer * q * in the rest frame of the deuteron , then the wave function of the two protons immediately after the impact will have the form ( we use the unit system with @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coordinate of the relative motion , @xmath23 is the coordinate of the center - of - mass , @xmath24 is the deuteron wave function .",
    "the expansion of the function @xmath25 over the stationary wave functions of the two protons , taking into account their identity and interaction in final state , gives the continuous spectrum of the relative momenta of the created protons .",
    "the magnitude of the differential cross section of the charge - exchange breakup of the deuteron is determined by the transitions from the deuteron spin states to the spin states of the two - proton system . in the impulse approximation ,",
    "the contributions of these transitions are connected with the spin structure of the amplitude of the charge transfer reaction @xmath26 .",

    "the differential cross section of the reaction @xmath34 in the case of unpolarized particles has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36\\ ] ] is the _ spin - nonflip _ part of the cross section , which is not connected with the spin quantum numbers of the fast nucleons , and @xmath37\\ ] ] is the _ spin - flip _",
    "( spin - dependent ) part of the cross section , conditioned by the presence of the nucleon spin . here",
    "the symbol tr ( _ trace _ ) denotes the sum of the diagonal elements of the operators acting in the spin space of target particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath38 is the spin of the target .",
    "as it is known , the neutron and the proton in the deuteron are in the triplet state ( with the unit total spin ) . when the deuteron is unpolarized , then each of the three spin states , corresponding to the projections of the total spin onto the quantization axis @xmath39 equal to + 1,1 and 0 , is realized with the probability of 1/3 .",
    "these states are the following : @xmath40 @xmath41 here the index 1 is related to the spin function of the neutron , and the index 2 is related to the spin function of the spectator proton . in the process @xmath42 the system of two protons can be created in the triplet states ( the index 1 in eqs .",
    "( 8) then also corresponds to a proton ) as well as in the singlet state with the zero total spin : @xmath43 it is easy to see that the operator @xmath32 in eq . ( 5 ) , being independent of the nucleon spin , leads to the production of the @xmath44-system only in the triplet states . as for the _ spin - flip",
    "operator @xmath45 , it generates the transitions to both the triplet and singlet states .    in accordance with the pauli principle for identical fermions , the coordinate wave function of two protons in the singlet ( triplet ) state is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) and the orbital angular momenta have only even ( odd ) values [ 4 ] . taking into account the proton identity and the properties of the pauli matrices ,",
    "the differential cross section of the process @xmath46 for unpolarized particles is expressed through the _ spin - nonflip _ and _ spin - flip _ parts of the differential cross section of the reaction @xmath27 at the momentum @xmath47 [ 3 ] : @xmath48\\times\\ ] ] @xmath49 @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the three - momentum of the spectator proton in the c.m .",

    "let us emphasize that in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the antisymmetrization and the symmetrization of the wave function @xmath54 with respect to the substitution @xmath55 are performed for the transitions to the triplet states and to the singlet state , respectively .    in the case of forward production of the two - proton system",
    ", we can put the value @xmath56 .",
    "the momentum transfer due to the change of the effective mass of the two nucleons at the transition @xmath57 is negligibly small as compared with the inverse radius of the deuteron.]@xmath58 as a result , the contribution of the transitions to the two - proton triplet states vanishes since the integrated function in the first term in eq .",
    "( 10 ) then represents the product of the antisymmetric two - proton coordinate wave function and the symmetric deuteron one .",
    "thus , the differential cross section of the forward charge - exchange breakup of the unpolarized deuteron on an unpolarized target is proportional to the _ spin - flip _ part of the differential cross section of the charge transfer reaction @xmath59 at zero angle [ 3 ] : @xmath60    generally , for any two - proton production angle , one can use the completeness conditions for the two - proton wave functions in continuous spectrum : @xmath61 and integrate the differential cross section over the proton three - momentum @xmath62 in the two - proton rest frame : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the deuteron form - factor . particularly , in forward direction ( @xmath65 ) the impulse approximation in eq .",

    "however , we will show later on that eq .",
    "( 14 ) for the cross section integrated over the spectrum of the proton relative momenta is valid also in the general case when the deuteron @xmath5-state is taken into account .",
    "following paper [ 3 ] , we will account now for the possible projectile and target polarization states in the process @xmath0 in forward direction .",
