    "some distance - type measures of this property were proposed @xcite . however , in order to avoid the complications encountered in extremization procedures of the previously defined distance - type degrees of entanglement @xcite , another pattern was followed in the case of non - gaussianity degrees @xcite .",

    "some time ago , another interesting evolution was found for two functions related to the von neumann entropy , namely , the linear entropy and the 2-entropy @xcite . in ref.@xcite",

    "we thus find it interesting to check on their entropic evolution under damping because we can take advantage of having evaluated the von neumann entropy for both the time - dependent state @xmath186 and the reference gaussian one @xmath187 . in the latter case",

    "therefore , the evolution of the von neumann entropy follows the same pattern as in the case of mixed gaussian states and obeys the same mean - occupancy and nonclassicality conditions .",
    "to sum up , in this work we have investigated the evolution of non - gaussian one - mode states during the interaction of the field mode with a thermal reservoir resulting in two processes : loss of nonclassicality indicated by the time development of the wigner and @xmath0 functions and loss of non - gaussianity shown by some recently introduced distance - type measures .",
    "we have analytically proved that the evolution of all input fock - diagonal states is characterized by three decoherence regions that can be related to some recent findings in quantum computation @xcite .",

    "the second region ends at the time @xmath111 [ eq .  ( [ tc ] ) ] when the @xmath0 representation becomes positive .",
    "the states in this region were described in quantum computation as bound universal states .",

    "<S> we investigate the loss of nonclassicality and non - gaussianity of a single - mode state of the radiation field in contact with a thermal reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the damped density matrix for a fock - diagonal input is written using the weyl expansion of the density operator . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the evolution of the quasiprobability densities reveals the existence of two successive characteristic times of the reservoir which are sufficient to assure the positivity of the wigner function and , respectively , of the @xmath0 representation . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the time evolution of non - gaussianity using three recently introduced distance - type measures . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on the hilbert - schmidt metric , the relative entropy , and the bures metric . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for an @xmath1-photon - added thermal state , we obtain a compact analytic formula of the time - dependent density matrix that is used to evaluate and compare the three non - gaussianity measures . </S>",
    "<S> we find a good consistency of these measures on the sets of damped states . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit damped quasiprobability densities are shown to support our general findings regarding the loss of negativities of wigner and @xmath0 functions during decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we point out that gaussification of the attenuated field mode is accompanied by a nonmonotonic evolution of the von neumann entropy of its state conditioned by the initial value of the mean photon number . </S>"
