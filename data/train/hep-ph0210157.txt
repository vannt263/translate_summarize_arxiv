    "jet production observables are among the most sensitive probes of qcd at high energy colliders , where they are used for example to determine the strong coupling constant . at present",
    ", the interpretation of jet production data within perturbative qcd is restricted to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations , with theoretical uncertainties considerably larger than current experimental errors .",
    "going beyond nlo calculations offers moreover a more accurate matching of theoretical and experimental jet definitions and a more detailed modelling of the hadronic final state  @xcite .",
    "the extension of jet calculations to nnlo requires three ingredients : the two - loop corrections to multi - leg amplitudes , the single unresolved limits of one - loop amplitudes and the double unresolved limits of tree amplitudes .",
    "finally , all these contributions have to be combined together into a program for the numerical computation of jet observables from nnlo parton level cross sections . in this talk",
    ", i review recent progress made on these subjects as well as the currently open issues .",
    "within dimensional regularization , the large number of different integrals appearing in multi - loop calculations can be reduced to a small number of so - called _ master integrals _ by using integration - by - parts ( ibp ) identities  @xcite .",
    "these identities exploit the fact that the integral over the total derivative of any of the loop momenta vanishes in dimensional regularization .    for integrals involving more than two external legs , another class of identities exists due to lorentz invariance .",
    "these lorentz invariance identities  @xcite rely on the fact that an infinitesimal lorentz transformation commutes with the loop integrations , thus relating different integrals .",
    "the common origin of ibp and li identities is the poincare invariance of loop integrals within dimensional regularization , as was pointed out by j.j .",
    "van der bij at this conference .",
    "using integration - by - parts and lorentz invariance identities , all two - loop feynman amplitudes for @xmath0 scattering or @xmath1 decay processes can be expressed as linear combinations of a small number of master integrals , which have to be computed by some different method .",
    "explicit reduction formulae for on - shell two - loop four - point integrals were derived in  @xcite .",
    "computer algorithms for the automatic reduction of all two - loop four - point integrals were described in  @xcite .",
    "the master integrals relevant to @xmath0 scattering or @xmath1 decay processes are massless , scalar two - loop four - point functions with all legs on - shell or a single leg off - shell .",
    "several techniques for the computation of those functions have been proposed in the literature , such as the application of a mellin - barnes transformation to all propagators , which was used successfully to compute the on - shell planar double box integral  @xcite , the on - shell non - planar double box integral  @xcite and two double box integrals with one leg off - shell  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the same method was used to derive the on - shell planar double box integral with one internal mass scale  @xcite as well as the high energy limit of the on - shell planar triple box integral  @xcite .",
    "a method for the analytic computation of master integrals avoiding the explicit integration over the loop momenta is to derive differential equations in internal propagator masses or in external momenta for the master integral , and to solve these with appropriate boundary conditions . the computation of master integrals from differential equations proceeds as follows  @xcite .",
    "carrying out the derivative with respect to an external invariant on the master integral of a given topology , one obtains a linear combination of a number of more complicated integrals , which can however be reduced to the master integral itself plus simpler integrals by applying the reduction methods discussed above . as a result ,",
    "one obtains an inhomogeneous linear first order differential equation in each invariant for the master integral .",
    "the inhomogeneous term in these differential equations contains only topologies simpler than the topology under consideration , which are considered to be known if working in a bottom - up approach . the master integral is then obtained by matching the general solution of its differential equation to an appropriate boundary condition .    using the differential equation technique , one of the on - shell planar double box integrals  @xcite as well as the full set of planar and non - planar off - shell double box integrals  @xcite were derived . the computer algebra structures applied in the computation of the master integrals from the differential equations are displayed in the right hand column of figure  [ fig : algebra ] .",
    "the differential equation approach has recently been extended to phase space integrals  @xcite .",
    "a strong check on all these computations of master integrals is given by the completely numerical calculations of  @xcite , which are based on an iterated sector decomposition to isolate the infrared pole structure .",
    "the methods of  @xcite were applied to confirm _ all _ of the above - mentioned calculations .",
    "a third approach , which avoids the reduction to master integrals , has been presented in  @xcite . in this approach , all integrals appearing in the two - loop amplitudes are related to higher transcendental functions , which can be expanded in terms of nested harmonic sums .    the two - loop four - point functions with all legs on - shell can be expressed in terms of nielsen s polylogarithms  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the closed analytic expressions for two - loop four - point functions with one leg off - shell contain two new classes of functions : harmonic polylogarithms  @xcite and two - dimensional harmonic polylogarithms ( 2dhpl s )  @xcite .",
    "accurate numerical implementations for these functions  @xcite are available .      with the explicit solutions of the integration - by - parts and lorentz - invariance identities for on - shell two - loop four - point functions and the corresponding master integrals , all necessary ingredients for the computation of two - loop corrections to @xmath2 processes with all legs on - shell are now available .",
    "the generic structure of such a calculation is outlined in the left hand column of figure  [ fig : algebra ] .",
    "in fact , only half a year elapsed between the completion of the full set of master integrals and the calculation of the two - loop qed corrections to bhabha - scattering  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , results were obtained for the two - loop qcd corrections to all parton - parton scattering processes  @xcite . for gluon - gluon scattering ,",
    "the two - loop helicity amplitudes have also been derived  @xcite .",
    "moreover , two - loop corrections were derived to processes involving two partons and two real photons  @xcite . since the gluon fusion into photons has a vanishing tree level amplitude , these results form part of the nlo corrections to photon pair production  @xcite , yielding a sizable correction .",
    "finally , light - by - light scattering in two - loop qed and qcd was considered in  @xcite .",
    "the results for the two - loop qed matrix element for bhabha scattering  @xcite were used in  @xcite to extract the single logarithmic contributions to the bhabha scattering cross section .      using the two - loop master integrals with one off - shell leg  @xcite , the two - loop qcd matrix element for @xmath3  jets  @xcite and the corresponding helicity amplitudes",
    "@xcite were computed following the reduction procedure depicted in figure  [ fig : algebra ] .",
    "the infrared pole structure of these results agrees with the prediction  @xcite obtained from an infrared factorization formula .",
    "an independent confirmation of part of these results was performed in  @xcite , where two of the seven colour factors ( corresponding to the terms proportional to @xmath4 ) of the two - loop helicity amplitudes for @xmath5  jets were derived using the nested sum method of  @xcite .",
    "processes related to @xmath5  jets by crossing symmetry are @xmath6-jet production in deep inelastic @xmath7 scattering and vector - boson - plus - jet production at hadron colliders .",
    "the analytic continuation of the @xmath5  jets two - loop helicity amplitudes to the kinematic regions relevant for these scattering processes has been derived in  @xcite .",
    "besides the two - loop virtual corrections , a nnlo calculation of jet observables has to include the contributions from single unresolved ( soft or collinear ) real radiation from one - loop processes as well as from double unresolved real radiation at tree level . only after summing all these contributions ( and including terms from the renormalization of parton distributions for processes with partons in the initial state ) ,",
    "do the divergent terms cancel among one another .",
    "the factorization properties of both the one - loop , one - unresolved - parton contribution  @xcite and the tree - level , two - unresolved - parton contributions  @xcite have been studied , but a systematic procedure for isolating the infrared singularities has so far been established only for the one - loop , one - unresolved - parton processes .",
    "although this is still an open and highly non - trivial issue , significant progress is anticipated in the near future .",
    "prior to their implementation into a numerical program , it is needed to analytically extract the infrared pole terms from the one - loop , one - unresolved - parton and two - unresolved - parton contributions . at nlo",
    ", two types of methods have been used very successfully in the past .",
    "the _ phase space slicing _ method  @xcite divides up the final state phase space into resolved and unresolved regions ; the infrared subtraction terms are then integrated only over the unresolved regions .",
    "this method avoids overcounting of singular contributions , the required integrals over restricted phase space regions can however be very involved beyond nlo .",
    "the _ subtraction _",
    "method  @xcite integrates the subtraction terms over the full phase space .",
    "the construction of the subtraction term requires in this case great care to avoid overcounting problems . in general , algorithms based on subtraction are more efficient numerically .",
    "the remaining finite terms must then be combined into a numerical program implementing the experimental definition of jet observables and event - shape variables .",
    "the sketch of such a programme to compute @xmath8 at nnlo is given in figure  [ fig : mc ] .",
    "programs to compute processes with initial state hadrons involve the additional complication of initial state singularities , which have to be absorbed into the nnlo parton distributions . lacking the full expressions for the splitting functions at this order ,",
    "these are not yet available at present , work on them is however well advanced  @xcite .",
    "a first calculation involving the features of nnlo jet calculations was presented for the case of photon - plus - one - jet final states in electron ",
    "positron annihilation in  @xcite , thus demonstrating the feasibility of this type of calculations .",
    "a prerequisite for such a numerical program computing @xmath9 jet final states is a stable and efficient next - to - leading order programme for the processes yielding @xmath10 jet final states . for the processes of highest phenomenological interest , these are already available : @xmath11  @xcite , @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "considerable progress has been made in the last two years ( in fact since the last `` loops and legs''- and `` radcor''-conferences ) towards the computation of jet observables at nnlo in qcd .",
    "in particular , new methods have been developed for the calculation of two - loop virtual corrections to four - point scattering amplitudes . as a result , the two - loop virtual corrections relevant to all phenomenologically important processes in qcd and qed are now known .",
    "these form however only part of the full calculation required at nnlo accuracy , which also has to take into account contributions from one - loop single - unresolved radiation and tree - level double unresolved radiation processes . while appropriate subtraction terms for these processes have been known for quite some time",
    ", their analytic integration ( required for the cancellation of infrared poles in physical jet observables ) is still an unsolved problem .",
    "once this obstacle has been overcome , the remaining finite parts can be implemented into a numerical programme to compute nnlo jet observables .",
