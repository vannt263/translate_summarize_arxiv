    "one of the most surprising and exciting possibilities for new physics at future colliders is the production of microscopic black holes  @xcite , which can occur in theories with large extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "string theory suggests a scenario in which the standard model particles are confined to a submanifold with the familiar three spatial dimensions ( the ` brane ' ) , while gravity is free to propagate in the full @xmath0-dimensional space ( the ` bulk ' ) . in that case",
    "the fundamental @xmath1-dimensional planck scale could be much lower than its effective 4-dimensional value , possibly of the order of tev .",
    "then gravity would look weak on distance scales large compared to the size of the extra dimensions , but could become as strong as the other forces at short distances .",
    "parton - parton collisions with centre - of - mass energies well above this scale could be treated as @xmath1-dimensional classical gravitational interactions .",
    "numerical studies suggest that in such circumstances the probability of coalescence to form a microscopic black hole would be large  @xcite",
    ". the black hole would be a powerful source of hawking radiation , decaying rapidly into all kinds of standard model particles . from a study of the decay products",
    ", it might be possible to deduce the number and size of the extra dimensions .",
    "in this paper i shall review some recent work on the above scenario .",
    "we shall see that , even if one accepts the basic assumption of tev - scale gravity in extra dimensions , there are many uncertainties and gaps in our understanding , which make reliable predictions impossible at present .",
    "nevertheless one can build models and simulations that allow one to explore different options for filling in the gaps , and enable experimentalists to start thinking about how they might analyse black hole events .",
    "i apologise for not mentioning all relevant topics and papers in this short review . for more complete discussion and references",

    "on purely dimensional grounds we expect the parton - level cross section for black hole formation to be of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the schwarzschild radius in @xmath1 dimensions , @xmath4^{\\frac 1{n+1}}\\ ] ] and @xmath5 is a `` formation factor '' of order unity .",
    "notice that we assume here that the black hole mass @xmath6 is equal to the full parton centre - of - mass energy @xmath7 ; this point will be discussed further later .",

    "on the other hand , the latter is only a lower bound on the cross section , obtained by finding a closed trapped surface on a particular slice of @xmath1-dimensional space - time  @xcite ; such a surface must be shielded by an event horizon . in this way",
    "one obtains a lower bound on the impact parameter for horizon formation , and hence on the cross section for black hole formation .",

    ", the @xmath21-dependence of the formation factor tends to cancel that of the schwarzschild radius , so that the cross section is not strongly dependent on the number of extra dimensions .",

    "scaledwidth=65.0% ]    , scaledwidth=65.0% ]    to estimate the cross section for black hole production at a hadron collider , we must convolve the parton - level cross section with the parton distributions in the incident hadrons .",
    "the resulting cross section for a @xmath22 collider at c.m .",
    "energy 14 tev ( i.e.  the lhc ) is shown in figure  [ fig : bhlhc ] . at the lhc design luminosity of @xmath23 @xmath24s@xmath25 ,",
    "this corresponds to more than one black hole per second with mass above 5 tev .",
    "if we accept the yoshino - rychkov result as a reliable estimate of the black hole formation factor , we see from figures  [ fig : bhcs ] and [ fig : bhlhc ] that a measurement of the cross section for a given range of black hole masses would fix the planck mass in a way that is substantially independent of the number of extra dimensions , at least in the astrophysically favoured region @xmath20 .    of course , one expects some dramatic changes in the cross section and final state at partonic c.m .",
    "energies around the planck scale , due to the onset of strong gravitational scattering . however , to predict those changes one would need a quantum theory of gravity , so deducing the planck mass from them would not be straightforward .",
    "measurements well above the planck scale , on the other hand , can reasonably be interpreted in a classical approximation , as we are doing here .",
    "the problem in any case is to make a reliable measurement of the black hole mass , or more correctly the partonic c.m .",
    "energy for black hole formation .",
    "since we do not observe the colliding partons , this can only be inferred from properties of the final state , which will be dominated by the decay of the black hole .",
    "although the formation of a horizon in parton collisions well above the planck scale seems reliably established , the nature and fate of the object thus created is much less clear .",
    "the usual working hypothesis has been that the evolution of the system has four phases :    * _ balding phase _ : all ` hair ' ( characteristics other than mass , charge and angular momentum ) and multipole moments are lost through gravitational and hawking radiation , and the object becomes the multidimensional generalization of a kerr - newman black hole .",
    "in fact any residual charge after this phase is probably negligible  @xcite , so the kerr solution is assumed . * _ spin - down phase _ :",
    "the kerr black hole loses angular momentum by hawking radiation and becomes a schwarzschild black hole . * _ schwarzschild phase _ :",
    "the black hole loses mass through hawking radiation and its temperature rises until the mass and/or temperature reach the planck scale . *",
    "_ planck phase _ : the object ( ` string ball ' ? ) is in the realm of quantum gravity and its fate can not be predicted .",
    "it could decay into a few quanta with planck - scale energies  @xcite , evaporate at the hagedorn temperature  @xcite , or even form a new kind of stable relic object  @xcite .    at present , each of these decay phases is subject to great uncertainty .",
    "the amount of gravitational radiation emitted in the balding phase is of major concern because this constitutes missing energy that would spoil the connection between collision energy and black hole mass  @xcite . in higher dimensions",
    "there are solutions to the einstein equation that are not simply generalizations of the four - dimensional solutions , such as black rings  @xcite .",
    "probably there are more complicated objects still to be discovered .",
    "it is not clear whether such configurations would be able to spin down to the schwarzschild solution , or what their hawking radiation would look like . even assuming the generalized kerr solution , the amount and distribution of hawking radiation during spin - down is still under investigation  @xcite .    in the schwarzschild phase",
    "too there are many points that require further clarification .",
    "what fraction of the hawking radiation is emitted as detectable standard model particles on the brane , and how much escapes into the bulk ?",
    "is the decay process too rapid for the relationship between black hole mass and temperature to remain valid throughout ?",
    "do secondary decays significantly distort the hawking spectrum ? and in the final planck phase , what are the consequences of alternative models for the fate of the remnant object ?",
    "many of these questions await theoretical answers , but some can be illuminated by numerical simulations . for the latter , we shall start with the hypotheses that practically all the energy of the parton collision goes into the black hole , that the decay is dominated by the schwarzschild phase , and that the hawking radiation consists entirely of standard model particles on the brane . with these assumptions , a detailed picture of the final state can be presented and the effects of some of the uncertainties can be investigated .      with the above assumptions , the spectrum of particles emitted during black hole decay takes the form @xmath26 where as usual the @xmath27 applies to bosons and fermions , @xmath28 is the hawking temperature @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a @xmath1-dimensional _ grey - body factor _ @xcite . the latter takes account of the fact that the wave function of a particle created in the intense gravitational field near the horizon has to propagate through the curved space around the black hole in order for the particle to be observed . by detailed balance ,",
    "the grey - body factor is equal to the absorption coefficient of the black hole for waves incident from infinity . for particles emitted at high energies",
    "the wavenumber is large compared with the curvature , so grey - body effects are small and the spectrum is close to black - body .",
    "but at low energy the emission is strongly modified in a way that depends on the spin and the number of extra dimensions .",
    "figures  [ grey0][grey1 ] , taken from @xcite , show the grey - body factors for scalars , fermions and gauge bosons as functions of the particle energy in units of the inverse horizon radius .",
    "what is actually plotted here is the absorption cross section in units of @xmath31 , which tends to 4 at high energies .",
    "we see that the main effect in extra dimensions is the suppression of low - energy gauge boson emission .",

    "it is difficult to see how the emission can remain thermal .",
    "however , we shall continue to make that assumption in the absence of any better understanding .",
    "assuming that the schwarzschild phase of decay is dominant , and that the mass and temperature are related by equation [ temp ] throughout ( which we have just seen must be doubtful ) , the total energy flux can be integrated  @xcite to find the time at which the entire mass of the black hole has been radiated away .",
    "this measure of the lifetime , expressed in units of the inverse of the initial mass , is shown in figure  [ life ] .",
    "we see that the lifetime falls very steeply as a function of the number of dimensions , and indeed can be comparable with the inverse mass when @xmath37 , even for masses well above the planck scale .",
