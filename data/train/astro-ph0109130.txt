    "in a previous paper ( newman & davis 2000 , hereafter nd00 ) , we described a new variant on the classical `` d@xmath0/d@xmath1 '' test which could be performed using data from the next generation of redshift surveys .",
    "this classical technique determines the evolution of the cosmic volume element by measuring the redshift distribution of a tracer whose number density is known , providing constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters . in the past , the abundance of galaxies was used to perform this test under the assumption that the total comoving number density of galaxies integrated over all luminosities is independent of redshift ( with further assumptions about the luminosity function ; e.g. loh & spillar 1986 ) .",
    "such assumptions may be suspect , but improving upon them would require a reliable , comprehensive theory of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "instead , nd00 suggests that by measuring the apparent abundance of galaxies as a function of their linewidth or velocity dispersion ( normalized to the abundance at @xmath4 ) , it is possible to obtain a more reliable measurement of the volume element , exploiting the simplicity of the dark matter halo velocity function .",
    "current and upcoming large redshift surveys with moderately high spectroscopic resolution will make this possible .",
    "the deimos / deep redshift survey ( hereafter , `` deep2 '' ) is particularly well suited for the technique .",
    "this project is a major effort to observe distant galaxies using the new deimos spectrograph on the keck telescope , scheduled to be installed in early 2002 .",
    "its goal is to obtain high quality spectra of 50,000 galaxies selected to have minimum redshift @xmath5 ( the `` 1hs '' , or 1-hour survey , so named because of the expected exposure time per slitmask ) and spectra of 5,000 such galaxies in selected regions to a fainter limiting magnitude ( the `` 3hs '' , or 3-hour survey ) .",
    "deep2 will obtain data characterizing galaxies and large - scale structure at @xmath6 comparable in quality to what is currently available for @xmath7 .",
    "although we have much information on the local universe , we know little about how it has reached its present state ; this survey has been designed to address this major gap in our knowledge .    in our previous work",
    ", we assumed that the uncertainties in a d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurement using deep2 would be dominated by poisson statistics and found that it could provide strong constraints on the cosmic equation of state parameter of quintessence - like models , @xmath8 . because the velocity function of dark matter halos is so simple ( a nearly perfect power - law at galactic scales )",
    ", we presumed that any systematic effects would leave a clear signature and could be removed or avoided , and that counting statistics would therefore dominate the uncertainties .",
    "however , we did not consider the fundamental limit to the accuracy of any count imposed by cosmic variance . in this paper , we calculate its impact on the deep2 survey .    since nd00 , a number of papers suggesting that systematic effects would compromise our proposed test have appeared in the literature ( e.g. bullock et al . 2000 ) , though again without actually evaluating their impact on realistic methods of measuring d@xmath0/d@xmath1 .",
    "this paper addresses that gap in our previous work ; we have performed quantitative tests of the impact systematic effects should have on our ability to measure d@xmath0/d@xmath1 with deep2",
    ". however , we must do so without the information that will be available at the completion of the survey . for instance , semi - analytic and n - body estimates of the impact of baryonic infall on the potential well depths of galaxies are still developing ( e.g. kochanek & white 2001 ) , and comparisons between hi rotation curves and o[ii ] linewidths for deep2 galaxies may be possible in the future , but are unavailable to us now .    rather than attempting to foresee all that the next few years will bring , we have instead chosen to evaluate the impact of major systematic effects by applying `` toy '' models of their impact to a semi - analytic prediction of the dark - matter halo velocity function ( a la nd00 ) .",
    "the semi - analytic methods used duplicate the general behavior seen in n - body simulations .",
    "the toy models used each have one free parameter that is treated as unknown going into the analysis .",
    "we then generate monte carlo realizations of the velocity function affected by these model systematics and determine the resulting errors in measuring both the free parameter and the abundance of dark halos in such datasets .",
    "thus , for any value of the free parameter we can determine the excess variance in a d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurement due to the residual uncertainty from that systematic effect after removal .",
    "so long as the toy models duplicate the major features of the real systematics , we should obtain reasonable estimates of the actual errors from deep2 . in @xmath9 2 of this paper",
    ", we calculate the impact of cosmic variance ; in @xmath9 3 , we determine the residual errors that will result from systematic effects ; and in @xmath9 4 , we present the constraints on cosmological parameters that a measurement of d@xmath0/d@xmath1 from the velocity function of deep2 galaxies would provide .",
    "by definition , the spatial correlations of galaxies imply that they are not distributed independently and thus can not obey simple poisson statistics . instead",
    ", in a given volume there will be an excess variance @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the two - point correlation function of galaxies and @xmath12 is the volume in which we wish to calculate the variance .",
    "this integral may more easily be evaluated in fourier space , where we obtain @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fourier transform of a spatial window function that is 1 inside the volume and zero elsewhere and @xmath15 is the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution . to evaluate the integral",
    ", we use the cdm - like power spectrum of bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) with @xmath16 and slope @xmath17 , consistent with recent observations .",
    "we are interested specifically in the effect of cosmic variance upon measurements of d@xmath0/d@xmath1 with deep2 ( as the volume observed in the next generation of @xmath4 surveys is much greater , cosmic variance in local comparison samples should be comparatively negligible ) . because the cfh12k camera used in imaging has a 30@xmath18 field of view , the most efficient geometry for each of the four fields to be surveyed @xcite is one which is @xmath19 in the shortest direction .",
    "based on observing time constraints , we further expect each field to cover @xmath20 in the long direction on the sky ; the required imaging is nearly complete . if we assume an @xmath21=0.3 @xmath22cdm model , this corresponds to @xmath23 mpc comoving at @xmath24 , the expected median redshift for the survey .",
    "we have calculated the cosmic variance for each field assuming that the volume surveyed is a rectangular solid extending 1300 @xmath25 mpc comoving in the redshift direction ( corresponding to @xmath26 ) .    for a rough estimate",
    ", we could assume that the power spectrum of galaxies has the same normalization as clusters today , applying the @xmath27 measurement of borgani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which yields 0.96 for an @xmath28 lcdm model ( for quintessence models , we use the relations of wang and steinhardt ( 1998 ) with @xmath29 ) .",
    "we then find that the uncertainty in a density measurement will be 5.9% in each of the four fields , or 2.9% for the entire survey ( as the fields are widely spaced on the sky , there should be minimal correlation between them at @xmath24 , so the combined variance goes as 1/@xmath30 ) .    however , to calculate the variance in counts of galaxies , we must use the power spectrum of galaxies at @xmath24 rather than clusters at @xmath7 ; we therefore must renormalize to match @xmath27 for galaxies .",
    "a measurement of the correlation length @xmath31 may be directly transformed into a measurement of @xmath27 if the correlation index @xmath32 is known ( peacock 1999 ) ; however , the correlation properties of galaxies at @xmath33 remain poorly known .",
    "observations suggest that @xmath34 mpc ( comoving ; see hogg et al .",
    "2000 ) , similar to the correlation length of the dark matter at that redshift , but semi - analytic models predict @xmath35 mpc ( comoving ) for luminous galaxies at that redshift @xcite . for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we expect cosmic variance in the deep volume to be somewhat lower than a naive calculation would yield : 1.4  2.2 % rather than 2.9% .",
    "since deep2 will obtain linewidths for @xmath39 galaxies with linewidths , the uncertainty due to cosmic variance will be roughly twice the poisson value . in figs . 1 and 2 , we show the effect of changing the survey geometry or areal coverage on the cosmic variance in overall deep2 results .",
    "the amount of area surveyed on the sky is clearly of greater importance than the shape of the surveyed region .",
    "cosmic variance need not impose a permanent limit to the precision of a deep2 d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurement ; if imaging of a wider area is available sufficient to produce an accurate photometric redshift distribution ( even if information on individual galaxies remains uncertain ) , it could be possible to renormalize the total abundances of galaxies in the deep2 fields and reweight the abundances of galaxies with observed linewidths .",
    "other redshift surveys extending to @xmath6 , particularly the vlt / virmos survey , could also provide corrections .",
    "however , cosmic variance would almost certainly remain an insurmountable obstacle to efforts to measure the evolution in the equation of state parameter @xmath2 via deep2 d@xmath0/d@xmath1 alone , since the variance is higher in any subvolume than for the survey as a whole .",
    "like most astronomical studies , the measurements proposed by nd00 could be subject to a number of systematic effects .",
    "if these systematics are well - understood and their magnitude is known , it is straightforward to correct for them when measuring the halo velocity function .",
    "however , few , if any , of the systematic effects that will affect this measurement can yet be predicted accurately . for instance , we can determine @xmath40 what effect a given luminosity - linewidth relation would have upon incompleteness in the velocity function , but without sufficient measurements at @xmath41 ( which will not be possible until the deep2 survey is conducted ) , we can not determine the resulting uncertainties with precision .",
    "thus , rather than attempt to guess the magnitude of systematic effects that will be better understood five years from now and calculate the errors in a measurement of d@xmath0/d@xmath1 that would result , we have attempted to determine to what degree we can measure and correct for systematics using the signatures they leave on the velocity function at @xmath6 . in many cases , this is a pessimistic assumption ; for instance , we will be able to measure our errors in determining linewidths by comparison to absorption line measurements of deep2 galaxies , rather than having to infer them from the velocity function alone",
    ". however , this technique has the significant advantage that we do not need to understand perfectly either the intrinsic velocity function of dark halos or any of the systematic effects to be able to assess their impact , so long as we can define `` toy '' models for them that replicate their major features and have the same free parameters that must be determined from the observations . for the intrinsic dark matter velocity function , we use the semi - analytic method of nd00 .",
    "we have tested models of three major systematic effects expected in our measurements : the impact of baryonic infall on the circular velocities of dark halos ; the effects of incompleteness at low circular velocities ; and random errors in determining those circular velocities from observations .",
    "we describe our models for these in more detail below .    as a further simplification ,",
    "since all physical models of either the halo velocity function or systematic effects simultaneously predict their dependence upon redshift , we determine the impact of systematics on d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurements by treating deep2 as simply measuring the velocity function at @xmath24 ( the expected median redshift of the survey ) .",
    "this should provide the same constraints that would result from likelihood maximization over redshift and velocity simultaneously , but reduces the number of variables to be evaluated and thereby speeds computation .",
    "thus , to determine the uncertainty resulting from one of the three systematic effects we : 1 ) choose a `` true '' value for the free parameter @xmath42 of the systematic , while using fiducial values for the other two .",
    "this defines a single probability distribution function ( pdf ) for galaxies ( which for this purpose we define as all objects with @xmath43 km s@xmath44 ) .",
    "2 ) generate 500 monte carlo realizations of the velocity distribution of deep2 galaxies by drawing an appropriate number of objects ( e.g. 10,000 for our `` best bet '' scenario ) from this pdf .",
    "3 ) for each realization , we attempt to determine the input value of the free parameter by likelihood maximization ( using pdfs defined on a dense grid in @xmath42 ) .",
    "the distribution of the best - fit values from these realizations defines the error in measuring @xmath42 ; this may be propagated into the uncertainty in the d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurement .",
    "we now describe in detail the systematic effects we have investigated and the models we have used for them :      as the baryons within a dark matter halo cool and collapse to form a galaxy , the mass distribution of the halo must respond .",
    "this changes the depth of the potential well , and thus the circular velocity in the halo on galactic scales @xcite .",
    "effectively , baryonic infall remaps a set of dark matter halos to higher circular velocity .",
    "although the idea is not new , theoretical investigations of baryonic infall are still improving @xcite ; we expect that they will be significantly advanced by the completion of deep2 .",
    "we thus have simply adopted a straightforward model from the literature ( gonzalez et al . 2000 ) .",
    "that model defines a remapping of the velocity function which combines an analytic treatment of baryonic infall with results of n - body simulations .",
    "there are three parameters in this model : @xmath45 , the galaxy spin parameter ; @xmath46 , the concentration index for the navarro , frenk & white dark matter halos assumed by gonzalez et al . ; and @xmath47 , the fraction of baryonic mass that forms the disk .",
    "the spin parameter @xmath45 is well - determined by n - body simulations ; gonzalez et al .",
    "assume @xmath45=0.04 , which yields results essentially identical to integrating over the gif @xmath45 distribution ( frenk et al .",
    "2000 ) . the concentration index @xmath46 may also be determined from n - body simulations or semi - analytically ( bullock et al .",
    "2000 ) ; furthermore , the effects of baryonic infall are essentially independent of @xmath46 for @xmath48 , a range deep2 galaxies at @xmath6 should all fall within .",
    "based on n - body simulations , gonzalez et al .",
    "give a relation between @xmath46 and @xmath49 for @xmath7 , @xmath50  km s@xmath44 ; we take this as our guide , with prefactor taken to be 8 rather than 13 ( following the results of bullock et al .",
    "this choice for our toy model is nearly arbitrary ; appropriate simulations would be used for baryonic infall corrections to real data , but we do not require that for now .",
    "however , the final component of the model , @xmath47 , can not be determined so reliably from simulations or semi - analytic models .",
    "we thus adopt it as the free parameter in our baryonic infall model , or more specifically , @xmath51 , the prefactor in the relationship between @xmath47 and circular velocity ( taken to be 0.1 by gonzalez et al . ) .",
    "this parameter has a much stronger impact on the baryonic infall remapping than @xmath45 or @xmath46 , and will be least well - known from simulations .",
    "the impact of @xmath51 on baryonic infall - corrected velocity functions is shown in fig .",
    "[ bipdf ] .",
    "observations of circular velocities of deep2 galaxies will , of course , be subject to measurement error .",
    "furthermore , optical spectroscopy of emmision - line objects will only determine the velocity of ionized gas at some radius within a galaxy ; it is unlikely that what is measured will be identical to the dark halo circular velocity .",
    "for instance , kobulnicky & gebhardt ( 1999 ) found that for galaxies at @xmath52 , velocity measurements using o[ii ] and hi for the same galaxy have a @xmath5320% scatter .",
    "because the velocity function follows a very steep power law ( @xmath54 ) for galaxy - scale halos , such a scatter can greatly change its shape and therefore potentially affect d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurements . for the purposes of this paper we wish to find if the amount of scatter may be determined from the observed velocity function alone .",
    "we have adopted a simple toy model for the error in velocity measurements : + @xmath55 .",
    "the first term arises from the instrumental resolution of deimos , which provides a fundamental limitation on the precision with which we can measure small velocities .",
    "the second term represents everything else that causes scatter between observed velocities and @xmath49 ( after correction for baryonic infall ) .",
    "the results of kobulnicky et al . suggest that the fractional error @xmath56 locally ( as the 20% scatter they found includes the effects of resolution ) ; @xmath57 might be reasonable for galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "the effect which various values of @xmath58 have upon the velocity function is shown in fig .",
    "[ velsigpdf ] .",
    "two types of incompleteness will affect attempts to use observable galaxies to count dark matter halos halos : incompleteness due to galaxies of a certain luminosity falling beyond the magnitude limit of the survey , and incompleteness due to dark halos which do not contain an observable galaxy .",
    "the former ( which we will hereafter refer to as `` luminosity incompleteness '' ) is easy to understand : given a luminosity - linewidth relation and its scatter , one can directly calculate the fraction of galaxies for a given linewidth that will fall beyond the magnitude limit of the deep2 survey , and adjust the velocity function accordingly . on the other hand , knowing what fraction of dark halos with a certain circular velocity host galaxies above the surface brightness limit of a survey ( or , for that matter , contain a galaxy at all ) requires a full model of galaxy formation .",
    "it is not clear if this uncertainty , which we will refer to as `` halo incompleteness '' , is an issue for the @xmath59 galaxies deep2 will observe or not .",
    "unobserved low - surface brightness galaxies could also be a problem for the @xmath52 comparison samples required for a d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurement .",
    "however , the local surveys now underway will contain @xmath60 times as many galaxies as deep2 , determining the impact of incompleteness from the observed velocity function should if anything be more effective than at @xmath6 .    lacking a model for halo incompleteness , we adopt luminosity incompleteness as our toy model . although bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that this effect will compromise measurement of d@xmath0/d@xmath1 using deep2 because the tully - fisher relation evolves with redshift , that seems highly unlikely to be a problem . with a sample of @xmath61 galaxies that have both magnitudes and linewidths ,",
    "defining the slope , zero point , scatter , and evolution of a luminosity - linewidth relation should all be possible .",
    "the effect of luminosity incompleteness on the velocity function is then completely fixed , and may be corrected for directly .",
    "we demonstrate below that in fact we could accurately determine luminosity incompleteness ( in the absence of halo incompleteness ) using the velocity function alone .",
    "however , since we lack sufficient simulations , we presume that the impact of halo incompleteness on the velocity function would be generally similar , so that we can assess the impact of halo incompleteness by evaluating how well we can determine luminosity incompleteness from the velocity function alone",
    ". this should be generically true ; it is likely that all high - circular velocity halos will contain a galaxy , and one above any surface brightness limitations of the survey at that , while smaller halos may well not .",
    "thus , the signature of the two sorts of incompleteness is similar : full completeness for high - velocities halos , rolling over to incompleteness at lower velocities .",
    "the issues involved in halo incompleteness should be much better understood by the time the deep2 survey is completed , as simulations and semianalytic techniques should only improve .    for our toy model of incompleteness",
    ", we follow the results of vogt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that the slope and scatter of the rest - frame @xmath62 tully - fisher relation appear to remain unchanged to @xmath6 .",
    "we take as a free parameter the zero point of the relation , or equivalently @xmath63 , the circular velocity ( after baryonic infall ) at which observations to the deep2 magnitude limit ( @xmath64 ) will be 50% complete at @xmath24 .",
    "we thus obtain a tully - fisher relation : @xmath65 where @xmath66 combines the @xmath67 correction ( small for conversion of @xmath62 at z@xmath530 to @xmath68 at @xmath33 ) , the hubble constant ( as @xmath69 ) and evolution of the tully - fisher zero point ; the results of vogt et al .",
    "suggest @xmath70 for an @xmath71 lcdm model , corresponding to @xmath72 km s@xmath44 .",
    "they found that the 0.65 mag dispersion in the tully - fisher relation at high redshift is consistent with being due to a 0.4 mag intrinsic scatter , a 0.2 mag scatter due to magnitude measurement errors , and a 0.47 mag scatter due to velocity errors .",
    "we apply our model incompleteness to the velocity function before adding noise , so only the first two elements of the scatter are relevant .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath63 on the velocity function is shown in fig .",
    "[ incpdf ] .      given these toy models ,",
    "we have generated monte carlo realizations of the resulting velocity functions as the parameters are varied , as described above .",

    "we expect that one - fourth to one - half of the 50,000 galaxies for which deep2 should obtain redshifts will provide velocity measurements .",
    "we therefore have used from 5,000 galaxies ( corresponding to the total number of objects in the deeper 3hs ) to 20,000 galaxies in our monte carlo realizations of the velocity function .",
    "based upon the simulations , we have compiled error budgets for a determination of the volume element in three scenarios : a pessimistic one in which there are only 5,000 objects with linewidth information and the free parameters of the systematic effects take values which result in the greatest errors ; a `` best bet '' scenario in which there are 10,000 objects and the free parameters have intermediate values ; and an optimistic scenario in which there are 20,000 objects and the free parameters take favorable values .",
    "we present the resulting error budgets for a measurement of apparent density within the entire deep2 survey volume in table 1 .",
    "observations , reducing our dominant systematic uncertainty . ] in every case , the distributions of the residual errors after correction for systematics showed no major non - gaussianities .",
    "the deep2 redshift survey will not simply measure d@xmath0/d@xmath1 at one redshift , but instead over the entire range @xmath26 . to determine the resulting constraints upon cosmological parameters",
    ", we must take this into account explicitly . because both cosmic variance and the residual errors from systematic effects after correction are essentially gaussian",
    ", we may use a @xmath75 paradigm . to simplify",
    ", we presume that deep2 measures d@xmath0/d@xmath1 in eight redshift bins , each covering 0.1 in @xmath1 .",
    "the observed abundance in each bin will be affected by poisson variance , by the residual errors from systematic effects after correction , and by cosmic variance .    to determine the poisson variance in each bin",
    ", we must know the number of galaxies within it .",
    "to estimate this , we use a fit to the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies in the hubble deep fields to the 1hs magnitude limit @xcite , which yields d@xmath0/d@xmath76 , and the total number of galaxies appropriate to each error scenario . to first order",
    ", residual systematic errors will affect all redshift bins in the same way .",
    "thus , for these errors we use the same fractional error in d@xmath0/d@xmath1 for all redshift bins and presume it is completely correlated amongst them . finally , given a cosmological model",
    ", we may calculate the cosmic variance within each redshift bin as in section 2 ; we treat it as completely independent between bins .",
    "in actuality , the number of objects in adjoining bins will be slightly correlated , but this is negligible compared to the uncorrelated part of the variance ( or to the residual errors from systematics ; the correlated part of the cosmic variance between our redshift bins is less than 10% of the total ) .",
    "given these definitions , the covariance matrix for our redshift bins is completely determined ; we list the values used ( for an lcdm model ) in table 2",

    "the worse the errors on @xmath21 , the less relative degradation cosmic variance and residual systematics will cause : if the error in @xmath21 were 0.01 , the resulting variance would be @xmath85 as large as predicted from poisson statistics , while if it were 0.05 , precision would be only @xmath86 worse than the poisson prediction .    in fig .",

    "3 of nd00 shows that even an optimistic but realistic error budget would yield poorer constraints than we previously predicted based on purely statistical errors .",
    "on the other hand , the measurement should yield much stronger limits on the dark energy than any other method available on the same timescale , at minimal marginal cost as it is a byproduct of a ground - based redshift survey that has been designed to address a number of issues in galaxy evolution and cosmology . if snap results are dominated by statistical uncertainties , they would yield cosmological constraints a factor of @xmath87 stronger than a d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurement based on the deep2 galaxy velocity function alone . in the long term",
    ", the deep2 results would remain a valuable check on snap and other methods , however , as they will be subject to very different systematic errors than other cosmological tests .",
    "deep2 will also provide other complementary measurements of cosmological parameters through a variety of methods ( e.g. by studying the abundance and velocity function of galaxy clusters within the survey volume ; see newman et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the uncertainties of newman & davis ( 2000 ) were overly optimistic by a factor of @xmath88 , as we ignored the effects of cosmic variance and had not yet tested the assumption that systematic effects could be found and corrected for based on the observed velocity function .",
    "we have demonstrated that this procedure can be implemented , though the residual errors from the correction procedure somewhat exceed the poisson errors in a d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurement .",
    "however , we have found no evidence that the test is compromised either by cosmic variance or any of the systematic effects considered . we must note",
    "also that our analysis has been conservative ; for instance , we have not assumed that observations of the velocity function at @xmath4 provides any constraints on systematic errors , nor have we considered the fact that comparison to larger - area multicolor imaging or redshift surveys could allow us to normalize out cosmic variance in the deep2 fields . with sufficient attention to detail , the classical d@xmath0/d@xmath1 test can provide much stronger constraints on dark energy than have ever been available before .",

    "<S> in a previous paper , we described a new variant on the classical `` d@xmath0/d@xmath1 '' test which could be performed using data from the next generation of redshift surveys . by studying the apparent abundance of galaxies as a function of their circular velocity or velocity dispersion , rather than luminosity </S>",
    "<S> , it is possible to avoid many of the uncertainties of galaxy evolution while using quantities that may be measured directly . in that work , we assumed that counting statistics would dominate the resulting errors . here , we present the results of including cosmic variance and determine the impact of systematic effects on attempts to perform the test with the upcoming deep2 redshift survey . </S>",
    "<S> for the deep2 survey geometry , cosmic variance yields errors roughly twice those predicted from poisson statistics . through monte carlo simulations we find that if the functional form , but not the strength , of any of the major systematic effects ( baryonic infall , velocity errors , and incompleteness ) is known , the free parameter may be determined from the observed velocity function . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic may then be corrected for , leaving a much smaller residual error . </S>",
    "<S> the total uncertainty from systematics is comparable to that from cosmic variance , but correlated amongst redshift bins . </S>",
    "<S> based on these analyses , we present error budgets for a d@xmath0/d@xmath1 measurement with deep2 and determine the resulting constraints on cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the uncertainty in the cosmic equation of state parameter @xmath2 are @xmath3 higher than previously derived , providing a measurement much stronger than any available today but weaker than some other proposed tests .    -12pt </S>"
