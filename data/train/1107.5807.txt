    "from the cosmological observational data @xcite , it is now well established that the present observable universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion . while the source driving this cosmic acceleration",
    "is known as ` dark energy ' its origin has not been well understood yet due to absence of a consistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "this acceleration is driven by the negative pressure of the dark energy .",
    "the ` cosmological constant ' is the most simple and natural candidate for explaining cosmic acceleration but it faces serious problems of fine - tuning and large mismatch between theory and observations @xcite . hence there has been significant development in the construction of dark energy models by modifying the geometrical part of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "this phenomenological approach is called as the modified gravity which can successfully explain the rotation curves of galaxies , the motion of galaxy clusters , the bullet cluster , and cosmological observations without the use of dark matter or einstein s cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 theories can produce cosmic inflation , mimic behavior of dark matter and current cosmic acceleration , being compatible with the observational data @xcite ( also see a recent review @xcite on @xmath5 gravity and its cosmological implications ) .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , the authors considered a generalized gravity model @xmath0 , with @xmath2 being the trace of stress - energy tensor , manifesting a coupling between matter and geometry . by choosing different functional forms of @xmath6",
    ", they solved the dynamical equations of astrophysical and cosmological interest . in the present work",
    ", we study the same model by taking different kinds of the energy sources .",
    "reconstruction of the cosmological models for this theory have been ivestigated by several authors @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the general action and the equation of the motion for @xmath0 . in section iii",
    "we reconstruct the cosmological models from the dust fluid . in section",
    "iv we generalize the dust fluid models to the general fluid with eos @xmath7 .",
    "section v is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "the action of @xmath0 gravity is of the form @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature @xmath9 and the trace @xmath10 of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 .",
    "we define the lagrangian density for matter field @xmath12 by @xmath13 the equation of motion ( eom ) is obtained by varying the action ( [ 1d ] ) with respect to @xmath14 @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the operator for covariant derivative and box operator ( or d alembert operator ) @xmath19 is defined via @xmath20 performing a contraction of indices in ( [ eom ] ) , we obtain @xmath21 here @xmath22",
    ". we will use ( [ eq ] ) to reconstruct @xmath0 for different kinds of matter .",
    "we consider the metric of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime @xmath23 following the conservation of the energy momentum tensor @xmath24 for metric ( [ metric ] ) we obtain @xmath25 the @xmath26component of ( [ eom ] ) reads @xmath27 in ( [ 8d ] ) , if we know the functional form of the hubble parameter @xmath28 as a function of the two independent variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then reconstruction of the model @xmath0 is straightforward .",
    "but always , we have a physical intuition about the form of @xmath29 .",
    "we clarify it here more . in a frw model",
    ", the form of the ricci scalar is @xmath30 .",
    "any cosmological era has a specific matter fields , radiation , phantom field or a mixed of them .",
    "for example in @xmath3cdm model , we have @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to see that we can write @xmath1 in terms of @xmath28 as @xmath32 . thus usually , we can write @xmath33 . thus ( 11 )",
    "can be integrated easily to give the functional form @xmath0 .",
    "also , since @xmath34 , @xmath35 thus all terms of the ( [ tdot ] ) are functions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 . for term as @xmath36",
    "we can write it as @xmath37 .",
    "mathematically , ( [ 8d ] ) is a second order partial differential equation for @xmath0 .",
    "we now discuss the solutions of ( [ 8d ] ) relevant in cosmological context . in the coming sections",
    "we will show that , any cosmological epoch ( radiation , matter , dark energy dominated eras ) can be constructed in a model of @xmath0 only with dust fluid as the source .",
    "we mention here that the form of the action @xmath0 is not unique .",
    "for this reason we can continue our investigation of the cosmological reconstruction for another model with @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "when we set @xmath39 , we recover the @xmath5 theory which has been discussed in @xcite . adopting the technique of the reconstruction of @xmath0 models , we have the following different models reconstructed from the dust fluid .      in einstein gravity ,",
    "the hubble parameter for a flat frw model with real matter field describes the @xmath3cdm model by @xmath41 , in units @xmath42 @xmath43 . since @xmath44 then the field equation ( [ 8d ] ) converts to the following form @xmath45f_{r}+ \\frac{1}{6}f=\\frac{2}{3}t(8\\pi+f_t)+81\\big(\\frac{r}{3}-3 h_0 ^ 2\\big)^{3}f_{rr}\\\\\\nonumber+9\\big(\\frac{r}{3}-3 h_0 ^ 2\\big)t^2 f_{tt}+54\\big(\\frac{r}{3}-3 h_0 ^ 2\\big)^2tf_{rt}-3t\\big(\\frac{r}{6}-5h^2\\big)f_t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solutions of ( [ eqa ] )",
    "can be obtained under two special cases as :    * @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath2 are constants .",

    "a universe filled with a mixture of the phantom and non - phantom components obey from the following expression for h , @xmath58 . here",
    "the set of the variables @xmath59 ( energy density of non - phantom matter ) @xmath60 ( energy density of phantom matter ) @xmath61 are the parameters of the model . in the early universe when the scale factor was small ,",
    "the first term in @xmath62 dominates and _ it behaves as the universe described by the einstein gravity with a matter whose eos parameter is @xmath63 _ which means that the matter field is non - phantom like .",

( [ phantom ] ) gives @xmath75 where @xmath2 is also a constant . furthermore if @xmath46 then eq . ( [ phantom ] ) can not be solved analytically or numerically .",
    "if we live in a universe filled by dust and the scale factor increases exponentially with time as @xmath76 , then hubble parameter is constant .",
    "such model which has been proposed firstly by de sitter , is called the de sitter universe . in this solution",
    ", it is assumed that the only source of matter filling the universe is dust .",

    "we will search for exact solutions of @xmath96 in the following cases .      substituting this form @xmath97 in ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath98 there is only one possibility to get an exact solution : when @xmath1 is constant.in this case , the solution for ( [ eq4 ] ) reads @xmath99 thus we have @xmath100      substituting this form of @xmath101 in ( [ eq3 ] ) we obtain @xmath102 note that the left and right hand sides of ( [ eq5 ] ) are functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . thus solving the @xmath2 dependent part of ( [ eq5 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath103 the solution for the @xmath1 dependent part of the ( [ eq5 ] ) is complicated .",
    "indeed we must solve the following equation @xmath104 or the following equivalent form @xmath105 one simple but interesting solution is obtained by taking ricci curvature to be constant . from ( [ eq7 ] ) we have @xmath106 thus one of the interesting models is @xmath107    ) against redshift @xmath108 .",

    "the chaplygin gas ( cg ) has the equation of state @xmath128 .",
    "there are some extensions of this model like the generalized chaplygin gas but we restrict ourselves only to the cg case .",

    "the lagrangian for a scalar field , which is minimally coupled to the background reads @xmath137 here @xmath138 is a free parameter .",

    "we show that the dust fluid reproduces @xmath3cdm , einstein static universe , de sitter universe , phantom - non - phantom era and the phantom cosmology .",
