    "tunneling through quantum dots ( or impurities ) has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in large amount of works , yet most investigations concentrated on the resonant tunneling through a single quantum level . in the case of the resonant tunneling through many levels one",
    "usually considered the total current as a sum of currents through individual levels . in general , however , this procedure can not be correct due to the quantum interference effects .",
    "we illustrate this point with a simple example .",
    "let us consider the resonant tunneling through a quantum dot coupled with two reservoirs with different chemical potentials , @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that two levels of the dot , @xmath1 , are inside the potential bias @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "then the electric current flows from the left ( emitter ) to the right ( collector ) reservoirs through the two levels .",
    "if we neglect the coulomb repulsion between the electrons , the total current is given by the landauer formula @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total transmission . since any electron from the left reservoir can tunnel to the right reservoirs via these two levels ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , the total transmission is given by a sum of two breight - wigner amplitudes : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a half of the total width .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 ( a symmetric dot ) , and that the tunneling widths are the same for both levels , yet the breight - wigner amplitudes can differ in phase .",
    "we therefore introduced the factor @xmath8 in ( [ a1 ] ) which denotes the relative phase of these amplitudes .",
    "it can be shown@xcite that @xmath8 can take only two values @xmath9 , the so - called `` in '' or `` out - of - phase '' resonances , respectively .",
    "it follows from ( [ a1 ] ) that , if the resonances do not overlap , @xmath10 , the total resonant current is a sum of the resonant currents flowing through the levels @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , if @xmath13 , the interference plays a very important role in the total resonant current .",
    "indeed , one easily finds that , in the case of constructive interference , @xmath14 , the total current increases with @xmath15 as @xmath16 and , in the case of destructive interference , @xmath17 , the total current decreases with @xmath15 as @xmath18 . since in the case of quantum dots",
    "the tunneling widths @xmath19 can be varied by the corresponding gate voltage , one can use this interference effect in order to measure the relative phase of different levels .",
    "this can provide an alternative method for a measurement of this quantity , in addition to that which utilized the aharonov - bohm oscillations@xcite .",
    "the interference effects described above are related to the stationary current .",
    "we can also anticipate the interference effects in temporal characteristics of the current .",
    "indeed , it is known that the average resonant current trough a _",
    "double - dot system _ would display damped oscillations generated by quantum interference@xcite . since any double - well potential can be mapped to a single well with two levels , one can expect to observe similar damped oscillations in the resonant current flowing through two levels of a single dot .",
    "the presence of oscillations in the average current is usually reflected in the current shot - noise power spectrum density , @xmath20 .",
    "for instance , the resonant current through a double - dot structure would develop a dip in the @xmath20 at the rabi frequency@xcite .",
    "similarly , one can think that the current flowing through two levels ( fig.[f1 ] ) would develop the same structure in @xmath20 at @xmath21 . however , the result should strongly depend on the relative phase of two levels .",
    "this phase - dependence of the spectral density has not been discussed in the literature , although this effect can have important applications .",
    "the interference effects in resonant tunneling can also be anticipated in the magnetotransport@xcite . indeed , in the presence of magnetic field , all levels in quantum dot or impurity are split ( zeeman splitting ) .",
    "therefore , electrons in the left reservoir with different orientation of spin ( parallel or anti - parallel to the magnetic field ) would tunnel to the right reservoir through the different zeeman sublevels of the dot . this alone can not result in quantum interference , since the corresponding spin states are orthogonal .",
    "however , if the @xmath22-factor in the dot is different from that in the reservoirs , then the spin - orbit interaction generates the spin - flip of an electron traveling through the quantum dot@xcite . as a result ,",
    "the same electron from the left reservoir flows to the right reservoir through two zeeman sublevels ( fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "similar to the previous case , one can expect that the related interference effects would be reflected in the behavior of the current spectral density @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , it was argued in@xcite that , in this way , one can explain the puzzled oscillations at larmour frequency observed in scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) experiments@xcite and considered as a promising tool for a single spin measurement@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the interference effects in resonant tunneling through multilevel systems as quantum dots or impurities . at first sight",
    ", the treatment of these effects looks rather straightforward in terms of single electron description [ ( [ a0 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) ] .",
    "however , this is not the case when the electron - electron repulsion inside the dot is taken into account .",
    "in fact , this effect can never be disregarded , and it always plays a very important role in the electron transport .",
    "for this reason , one uses the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function technique@xcite for an account of the interaction effect in the electron transport .",
    "these calculations , however , are rather complicated and are usually performed only in a weak coupling limit . in this paper , we use a different , simpler , and more transparent technique developed by us in ref .  @xcite-@xcite that consists of reduction of the schrdinger equation to bloch - type rate equations for the density matrix obtained by integrating over the reservoir states . such a procedure can be carried out in the strong nonequilibrium limit without any stochastic assumptions and valid beyond the weak coupling limit .",
    "the resulting equations can be used straightforwardly for evaluating the current in a multilevel system and its power spectrum , with the coulomb repulsion inside the dots taken into account .",
    "the remainder of this paper is as following . in section",
    "ii we study the resonant tunneling through two levels of the quantum dot .",
    "we obtain the generalized quantum rate equations describing the entire system , including the electric current .",
    "special attention is paid to effect of the relative phase of resonances on the average current and on the shot - noise power spectrum . in section iii , we concentrate on the magnetotransport through quantum dots or impurities .",
    "we derive the rate equations for this case and evaluate the shot - noise power spectrum .",
    "the obtained results suggest a natural explanation of a peak at the larmor density and the hyperfine splitting due to interaction with nuclear spin found in new stm measurements .",
    "this provides us with a possibility of a single nuclear spin detection .",
    "section iv provides a summary .",
    "let us consider resonant transport in a multilevel system . we shall treat this problem in the framework of a tunnel hamiltonian approach .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following tunneling hamiltonian describing the electron transport from the emitter to the collector via different levels of a quantum dot ( impurity ) @xmath23 ( fig .  1 ) ,",
    "@xmath24 , with @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron in the reservoirs and @xmath27 is the same operator for an electron in the dot ( we omitted the spin indices ) .",
    "the operator @xmath28 denotes the coulomb interaction of between electrons in the dot and @xmath29 is a coupling between the states @xmath30 and @xmath23 of the reservoir and the dot , respectively .",
    "this coupling is related to the corresponding tunneling width by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the density of states in the corresponding reservoir .",
    "( in the absence of magnetic field , one can always choose the gauge such that all couplings @xmath33 are real ) .",
    "all parameters of the tunneling hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] ) are related to the initial microscopic description of the system in the configuration space ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "for instance , the coupling @xmath35 is given by the bardeen formula@xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the electron wave functions inside the dot and the reservoir , respectively , and @xmath39 is a surface inside the potential barrier that separates the dot from the corresponding reservoir . in one - dimensional ( 1-d )",
    "case @xmath40 and @xmath41 , ( [ a3 ] ) can be rewritten as@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the point @xmath44 should be taken inside the left ( right ) barrier and far away from the classical turning points where @xmath35 becomes practically independent of @xmath45@xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite-@xcite that the schrdinger equation @xmath46 , describing the quantum transport through a multidot system , can be transformed to the bloch - type rate equation for the reduced density - matrix @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are the discrete states of the system in the occupation number representation and @xmath49 is the number of electrons arriving at the corresponding reservoir by time @xmath50 .",
    "this reduction takes place after partial tracing over the reservoir states , and it becomes the exact one in the limit of large bias @xmath51 without explicit use of any markov - type or weak coupling approximations . as a result ,",
    "the off - diagonal in @xmath49 density matrix elements , @xmath52 , becomes decoupled from the diagonal in @xmath49 terms , @xmath53 , in the equations of motion@xcite .",
    "finally , one arrives at the following bloch - type equations describing the entire system @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denotes one - electron hopping amplitude that generates @xmath57 transition .",
    "we distinguish between the amplitudes @xmath58 and @xmath33 of one - electron hopping among isolated states and among isolated and continuum states , respectively .",
    "the latter transitions are of the second order in the hopping amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "these transition are produced by two consecutive hoppings of an electron across continuum states with the density of states @xmath60 .    solving ( [ a5 ] )",
    ", we can determine the probability of finding @xmath49 electrons in the collector , @xmath61 .",
    "this quantity allows us to determine the average current @xmath62 and the current power spectrum .",
    "the latter is given by the mcdonald formula@xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "consider again the resonant tunneling through the two levels , ( fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "let us assume that the coulomb repulsion of electrons inside the dot @xmath65 is large such that two electrons can not occupy the dot .",
    "then , there are only three available states of the system , shown in fig .  [ f2 ] .",
    "let us apply ( [ a5 ] ) by assigning @xmath66 , in an accordance with the states shown in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "since the states @xmath67 and @xmath68 are not directly coupled , the corresponding hopping amplitude @xmath69 in ( [ a5 ] ) . however , these states can be connected through the reservoirs [ the third and the forth terms of ( [ a5 ] ) ] .",
    "we assume that the corresponding couplings are weakly dependent on the energy , so that @xmath70",
    ". however , the sign of the @xmath71 may be the opposite one with respect to the sign of @xmath72 .",
    "note that , in the 1-d case , a sign of the product @xmath73 is determined by a sign of the product @xmath74 , [ see ( [ a4 ] ) ] .",
    "the latter can be positive or negative , depending on the number of nodes of @xmath75 inside the dot@xcite .",
    "thus , for a 1-d dot , the product @xmath76 changes its sign when @xmath77 .",
    "the reason is that the corresponding wave functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 differ by an additional node .",
    "hence , the ratio @xmath80 is @xmath81 for a 1-d dot .",
    "however , in the case of a three - dimensional ( 3-d ) quantum dot , where the corresponding coupling @xmath33 is given by ( [ a3 ] ) , this condition does not hold .",
    "taking into account ( [ aa7 ] ) one obtains from ( [ a5 ] ) the following quantum rate equations describing the electron transport through two levels    lcl [ a8 ] _ 00^n&=&-2_l_00^n+_r(_11^n-1 + _ 22^n-1 ) + & &   + _",

    ", we assumed that @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 . in the case of a different gauge , @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    ", the factor @xmath8 would appear only in front of the width @xmath88 in ( [ a8d ] ) .",
    "this of course does not affect the final result .",
    "equations ( [ a8a])-([a8d ] can be interpreted in terms of `` loss '' and `` gain '' terms , and , therefore , they represent the quantum rate equations .",
    "for instance , the first ( loss ) term in ( [ a8a ] ) describes decay of state ( 0 ) in fig.[f2 ] due to tunneling of one electron from the left reservoir to the dot .",
    "the second ( gain ) term of the same equation describes decay of states ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to state ( 0 ) .",
    "the last ( gain ) term describes decay of the linear superposition of states ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "it is given by the product of the corresponding hopping amplitudes from the levels @xmath1 to the collector reservoir .",
    "since these amplitudes can differ by a sign , this term is proportional the relative phase @xmath8 between the states @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to note that all transitions in ( [ a8 ] ) take place through available continuum states .",
    "therefore , the terms @xmath89 and @xmath90 in ( [ a8b ] ) and ( [ a8c ] ) can couple with the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath91 through the right reservoir only .",
    "the coupling via the left reservoir would be possible for noninteracting electrons through a new state ( @xmath92 ) corresponding to two electrons occupying the levels @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the rate equations in this case would be totally symmetric with respect to an interchange of @xmath88 and @xmath93 , and the result will coincide with that of the single electron description , [ see ( [ a0 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) ] .",
    "note also that , in the case of @xmath17 , the two - level system , shown in figs .",
    "[ f1],[f2 ] , can be mapped to a coupled - dot system .",
    "then ( [ a8 ] ) turn into the system of quantum rate equations , found earlier for a description of electron transport through the coupled - dot system@xcite .    on can find that the factor @xmath94 , in ( [ a8 ] ) has the same meaning as the relative phase @xmath8 of two breit - wigner amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is always @xmath81 for two subsequent resonances in one dimensional case .",
    "however , in a 3-d quantum dot , the two subsequent resonances can be found in the same phase , depending on particular properties of the quantum dot .",
    "one even predicts a whole sequence of the resonances with the same phases@xcite .",
    "thus , a measurement of the resonance phase @xmath8 could supply us with additional information on a quantum dot ( impurity ) structure , complementary to spectroscopic measurements .",
    "consider first the total current , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 , [ see ( [ a6 ] ) ] are the currents in the left or in the right reservoirs . the coefficients @xmath97 and @xmath98 with @xmath99 depend on each junction capacitance@xcite .",

    "as expected , when the resonances begin overlap , the current becomes very sensitive on a sign of the relative phase @xmath8 .",
    "this is illustrated fig .",
    "[ f3](a ) , where we plot the stationary current @xmath106 as a function of the widths @xmath107 .",
    "one finds that the current @xmath106 decreases with @xmath93 if @xmath108 and increases with @xmath93 if @xmath14 .",
    "however , the dependence of the total current @xmath106 on the width @xmath88 [ fig.[f3](b ) ] is rather unexpectable .",
    "one finds that the current increases for both values of @xmath8 .",
    "this is very different from the case of non - interaction electrons [ ( [ a0 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) ] where the current is symmetric under an interchange of @xmath88 and @xmath93 .",
    "such an asymmetry in the case of interacting electrons is a result of the coulomb blockade effect@xcite .",
    "indeed , an electron enters the dot from the left reservoir with the rate @xmath109 .",
    "however , it leaves it with the rate @xmath93 , since the state where the two levels @xmath1 are occupied is forbidden due to electron - electron repulsion .",
    "these results can be verified experimentally in the case of a quantum dot , where the width @xmath19 can be varied by changing the corresponding gate voltage .",
    "then the relative phase @xmath8 can be obtained from observing the behavior of the resonant current with @xmath93 [ fig .",
    "[ f3](a ) ] .",
    "the quantum interference effects appear as well in the time - dependent current .",
    "let us calculate @xmath110 [ ( [ a9 ] ) ] by solving [ ( [ a8 ] ) ] with the initial conditions @xmath111 corresponding to the empty dot .",
    "the time - dependent average current is shown in fig .",
    "[ f44 ] for @xmath112 and @xmath113 for two values of the relative phase , @xmath114 .",
    "one finds from this figure that the current displays strong oscillations in contrast with resonant    tunneling through a single level .",
    "the influence of the relative phase @xmath8 on the quantum oscillations is very substantial .",
    "indeed , the oscillations related to different values of @xmath8 are shifted by half of the period and , moreover , the corresponding dampings are quite different .",
    "the oscillations in the average current are reflected in the shot - noise power spectrum given by @xmath115@xcite . here",
    "@xmath116 is the current power spectrum in the left ( right ) reservoir , [ ( [ a7 ] ) ] and @xmath117 is the charge correlation function of the quantum dot .",
    "the latter can also be obtained from ( [ a8 ] ) .",
    "again , we take for simplicity the case of @xmath100 , so that @xmath118",

    ", we calculate the ratio of the shot - noise power spectrum to the schottky noise @xmath121 ( fano factor ) , where @xmath106 is given by ( [ a10 ] ) .",
    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] for @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which are the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ f44 ] , and @xmath124 . as expected , the quantum interference is reflected in the shot - noise power spectrum .",
    "we find that the corresponding fano factor shows a peak at @xmath125 in the case of `` in - phase '' resonances and a dip for out - of - phase resonances .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ f4 ] displays the fano factor for an asymmetric quantum dot , @xmath126 , such a strong influence of the phase on the shot - noise power spectrum pertains in a general case .",
    "the effect is merely more pronounced for the asymmetric dot .",
    "the reason is the coulomb repulsion that prevents two electron from occupying the dot ( c.f . with fig .  [ f3 ] ) . for noninteracting electrons ( @xmath127 )",
    ", however , the effect is mostly pronounced for a symmetric case , @xmath128 .",
    "obviously , the shot - noise spectrum of resonant current through a double - dot system should be similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] for @xmath108 .",
    "indeed , such a system is mapped to a single dot with two levels , corresponding to the symmetric ( nodeless ) and antisymmetric ( one - node ) states .",
    "therefore the corresponding shot - noise power spectrum would always show a dip at rabi frequency ( cf.@xcite ) , in contrast with earlier evaluations , which predicted a peak@xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the measurement of shot - noise spectrum can be used for a measurement of the relative phase @xmath8 . technically , it would be more complicated than the measurement of the total current as a function of @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) , which also determines @xmath8 , yet the measurement of @xmath20 does not distort the dot , and the phase @xmath8 can be determined even for non - overlapping resonances , @xmath129 .",
    "consider now the electron transport through a quantum dot or impurity in the presence of magnetic field . in this case , all of the levels of the quantum dot are doubled due to the zeeman splitting ( fig .",
    "then an electron with spin - up can tunnel only through the upper level ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) . respectively , an electron with spin - down tunnels only through the lower level .",
    "no interference takes place in this case .",
    "however , if @xmath22-factors in the quantum dot and in the reservoirs are different , the tunneling transitions are accompanied by the spin flip@xcite .",
    "then the same electron can tunnel from the left to the right reservoir via two level ( cf . with fig .",
    "this process would generate oscillations in the resonant current in the same way as was discussed in the previous section .",
    "let us evaluate the corresponding tunneling amplitudes , which we denote as @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively , for no spin - flip and spin - flip transitions ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) . this can be done by using ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "consider for the definiteness the electron transitions between the dot and the right reservoir .",
    "the corresponding reservoir wave function @xmath132 of ( [ a3 ] ) is represented by a kramers doublet @xmath133 , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are functions of spatial coordinate @xmath136 only",

    "the two components @xmath142 and @xmath143 are of the same order of magnitude and so @xmath144 .",
    "the corresponding tunneling amplitudes from the resonant level and the left reservoir are evaluated in the same way .",
    "now we can obtain the quantum rate equations for magnetotransport through the zeeman doublet ( fig .",

    "an essential requirement for our explanation should be a sizable spin - orbit coupling effect .",
    "this would imply that the @xmath22-factor near impurity is different from those inside the bulk and in the tip .",
    "this might be due to low space symmetry of an impurity on the surface@xcite .",
    "also , the nature of the tip can play a major role , so that the @xmath22-factor of the tip would depend strongly on the tip radius@xcite .",
    "it follows from our arguments that the peak in the stm current spectrum is not an evidence of a single spin detection , but rather an effect of coherent resonant scattering ( tunneling ) on impurity .",
    "nevertheless , the above described spin - coherence mechanism can be used for a single nuclear spin detection , as was suggested in@xcite",
    ". indeed , due to the hyperfine coupling , each electronic level will be split into a number of sub - levels . then , according to our model , the peak in stm current spectrum would be split in a number of peaks corresponding to transitions between various hyperfine levels .",
    "such a splitting , in fact , has already been observed in recent measurements@xcite .",
    "the data clearly displays different peaks in the current power spectrum  evidence of hyperfine splitting .",
    "these experimental results strongly supports our explanation and opens a new way for a measurement of single nuclear spin@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we studied the interference effects in quantum transport through quantum dots or impurities , where the transport is carried via several levels . in our investigation",
    ", we used a new method of quantum rate equations which is mostly suitable for treatment of this type of problems and accounts the coulomb repulsion in a simple and precise way .",
    "we found that the interference effects strongly affect the total current as well as the current power spectrum and depend on the relative phase of the levels , carrying the current .",
    "for instance , in the case of out - of - phase resonances , the total current drops down when the coupling with the collector _ increases_.",
    "this contraintuitive result represents an effect of the destructive interference . on the other hand",
    ", no destructive interference effect would appear when one increases the coupling with the emitter .",
    "such an unexpected asymmetry between the emitter and the collector does not appear in the case of non - interacting electrons .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the interference effects are reflected in the shot - noise power spectrum of the resonant current .",
    "we found that this quantity depends very strongly on the relative phase of the resonances .",
    "it shows a peak for in - phase resonances and a dip for out - of - phase resonances .",
    "this opens a possibility for studying the internal structure of quantum dots or impurities by measuring the shot - noise spectrum of the current flowing through these systems .",
    "finally , we applied our method for study the interference effect in magnetotransport .",
    "we showed that , due to the spin - orbit interaction , the electric current would display the interference effects of the same nature as in the tunneling through two levels , separated by the zeeman spitting .",
    "we suggest that this phenomenon can explain the modulation of stm current found in different experiments and attributed to the larmor precession of the localized spin . yet , according to our model , these experiments display the interference effect .",
    "the hyperfine splitting of the signal into several peaks , found in recent experiments , confirms our model and gives a possibility to use the interference effect as a new effective tool for a single spin measurements .",
