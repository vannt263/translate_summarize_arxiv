    "several recent results suggest that the field equations of gravity have the same conceptual status as the equations of , say , elasticity or fluid mechanics , making gravity an emergent phenomenon ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "this paradigm provides an alternative description of spacetime evolution as being driven by the difference between the surface and bulk degrees of freedom , and can be derived from a thermodynamic variational principle that extremizes the heat content of null surfaces @xcite .",
    "this approach also provides a strikingly different perspective on cosmology in general and the  in particular .",
    "the main goal of this review is to explain how one can obtain a solution to the cosmological constant problem in the backdrop of the emergent perspective of gravity .",
    "the plan of the review is as follows : in the next section , we start with a brief overview of the conventional approach to cosmology in which the friedmann universe is described in terms of the standard parameters like @xmath4 etc .",
    "we then motivate and describe an alternative , _ epoch invariant _ parameterization of cosmology in which the universe is described by a set of variables ( essentially three energy densities , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) whose numerical values are manifestly independent of the epoch at which they are measured .",
    "we identify these as the three energy densities associated with the three phases of evolution of the universe , viz . the inflationary phase ( @xmath7 ) , the radiation - matter dominated phase ( @xmath8 ) and the late time accelerating phase ( @xmath6 ) . of these three ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are expected to be determined by high - energy physics models .",
    "however , there does not exist a physical principle which determines the extremely small value of @xmath9 in natural units .",
    "after briefly reviewing ( sec.[sec : approaches ] ) several approaches in the literature to handle the above cosmological constant problem , we identify , in sec.[sec : nscc ] , the essential theoretical ingredients which are needed for this purpose .",
    "we argue that , for a viable solution to the problem , we must have the following three features in the theory of gravity : ( a ) the field equations of gravity must be invariant under the addition of a constant to the matter lagrangian .",
    "( b ) the cosmological constant must appear as an integration constant in the solutions .",
    "( c ) to determine its value , a new physical principle is required .    of these three requirements , ( a ) and ( b ) are known to be naturally satisfied in the emergent gravity paradigm , as described in sec.[sec : egandcc ] .",
    "we , therefore , start with the requirement ( c ) in sec.[sec : cosmin ] . using the epoch invariant parametrization of cosmology",
    ", we construct a dimensionless number ( which we call ) , that counts the number of modes within a hubble volume that cross the hubble radius from the end of inflation to the beginning of the late - time accelerating phase .",
    "we show how the introduction of  and the postulate that the numerical value of  is @xmath10 allow us to determine the _ correct , observed value _ of the cosmological constant for a guts scale inflation and the allowed range in the matter and radiation energy densities as determined from cosmological observations .",
    "in other words ,  allows the determination of the numerical value of the cosmological constant from first principles in terms of other parameters that are expected to be determined from high energy physics .    in sec.[sec : egandcc ] , we examine these issues in the backdrop of the emergent gravity paradigm , in which the evolution of the universe is described as a quest towards holographic equipartition , and the field equations of gravity are invariant under the additional of a constant to the matter lagrangian with the cosmological constant appearing as an integration constant in the solutions . together with the introduction of  and the postulate that  @xmath11 ,",
    "this provides a comprehensive approach that determines the value of the cosmological constant .",

    "to study the dynamics of the universe , it is convenient to separate the evolution of a hypothetical smooth universe from the growth of structures which arise due to the amplification of the initial perturbations through gravitational instability .",
    "the background universe can be described by a homogeneous , isotropic friedmann model .",
    "the density perturbations are usually characterized by the initial power spectrum ( possibly generated during the inflationary phase ) and specified by an amplitude and power spectrum index .",
    "most of this review will be concerned with the evolution of the background universe , rather than the growth of structures , and hence we will begin by rapidly reviewing the standard description of the friedmann universe .    the dynamics of the friedmann universe is essentially characterized by a single degree of freedom @xmath14 ( called the expansion factor ) and the curvature of the spatial section of the universe .",
    "observations indicate that the spatial curvature is close to zero , and hence we can describe the universe as a spatially flat frw line element given by @xmath15    \\label{s11.1}\\ ] ] ( during most part of this review , we will assume that the universe is spatially flat ; our results and discussions can be easily generalized to other cases and we will make comments about this when relevant . ) einstein s equations then determine @xmath14 in terms of the energy density , @xmath16 , and pressure , @xmath17 , of the matter which occur in the source energy - momentum tensor @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "these are given by @xmath19 these equations can be manipulated to give the result : @xmath20 . given an equation of state @xmath21 , this equation can be integrated to give the evolution of energy density : @xmath22 . using this in the second equation in , we can determine the evolution of the universe , viz .",
    ", @xmath23 .",
    "similar ideas work even when the source is made of several non - interacting components like e.g , matter , radiation , dark energy etc .",
    "what is not stressed in literature is that the above , standard description of the universe gives us _ complete _ freedom in the evolutionary history _",
    "if _ we do not impose any constraint on the energy density and pressure .",
    "more precisely , given _ any _ @xmath14 , it is possible to construct a universe by choosing a suitable equation of state @xmath24 along the following lines .",
    "we first determine @xmath25 from the given @xmath14 and then obtain the energy density and pressure of the source through the equations @xmath26\\ ] ] eliminating @xmath27 between the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we obtain the equation of state @xmath24 which will consistently provide the correct dynamical evolution with the previously prescribed @xmath14 .",
    "note that the energy density @xmath16 is positive by definition in the above construction while the pressure @xmath17 could be positive or negative .",
    "current cosmologists do not consider negative pressure a taboo , and hence the above description allows one to create _ any _ evolutionary history by postulating a suitable equation of state for the source",
    ".    obviously , to have a reasonable , predictive theory of the universe , we need to ensure that the matter source is made of physically relevant components .",
    "such a model has been put together over the years and is well supported by observations .",
    "these observations indicate that our universe can be characterized by three distinct phases of evolution : an early inflationary phase , driven possibly by a guts scale scalar field , a phase of accelerated expansion at late time , dominated by dark energy ( which is assumed to be a  in this review ) and a transient phase in between , dominated by radiation and matter ( which includes both dark matter and baryons ) .    a convenient parameterization of energy densities of these components in is required to describe the different phases of the universe in a natural manner . in the next subsection , we will briefly review the standard parameterization used in cosmology .",
    "it turns out , however , that this is not best suited to study the fundamental issues we are interested in .",
    "hence , we will motivate and introduce in sec.[sec : epochinv ] an alternate parameterization which serves our purpose .      to describe the evolutionary history of our universe",
    ", we conventionally use a set of parameters which could be taken as the following . to begin with , the first and the last phases have approximately constant hubble radii , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , related to the respective constant rates of expansion of the universe during these phases . while the hubble radius @xmath28 of the inflationary phase is related to the mechanism driving inflation , the hubble radius during the late - time accelerating phase can be related to a cosmological constant @xmath0 with @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , the radiation and matter content of the universe are usually parameterized in terms of the dimensionless numbers , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are defined as @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the current age of the universe , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the energy densities of radiation and matter in the universe at @xmath37 .",
    "[ throughout this review , we use the convention that the symbols @xmath31 and @xmath32 always refer to density parameters at the present epoch ; when we refer to density parameters , determined at time @xmath38 ( corresponding to the expansion factor @xmath39 ) , we specifically indicate this dependence in a bracket as @xmath40 , @xmath41 etc . ] .",
    "we include all species of particles with the equation of state @xmath42 into radiation and all species of particles with the equation of state @xmath43 into matter .",
    "in particular , the matter energy density includes both , that of dark matter particles as well as that of baryons .",
    "the interaction between radiation and matter as well as various physical processes in the early universe are irrelevant for the purposes of our discussion and hence we assume that the radiation and matter components evolve independently .    thus , we have introduced so far five parameters ( @xmath44 ) which are mutually independent .",
    "the density parameter of dark energy ( modeled as a ) , @xmath45 , measured at the present epoch , is given by @xmath46 and is _ not _ an independent parameter .",
    "it is convenient at this stage to assume that our universe is spatially flat so that @xmath47 .",
    "since we postulate the existence of an early inflationary phase of adequate duration in the universe , it is quite reasonable ( and may be even mandatory ) to assume that the post - inflationary evolution of the universe is described by a spatially flat model .",
    "this condition of spatial flatness , which is equivalent to @xmath48 allows us to eliminate @xmath49 or @xmath50 in favour of the other .",
    "thus , the evolution of the spatially flat universe can be described , for example , in terms of four independent parameters ( @xmath51 ) . the expansion factor @xmath14",
    "will then be determined by the equation : @xmath52 \\qquad\\text{(after inflation)}\\\\   h_{\\rm inf}^2 \\qquad \\text{(during inflation ) }   \\end{cases } \\label{a1}\\ ] ] these two equations have to be matched at the end of inflation , if complications arising from reheating , etc . are ignored .",
    "( we will comment briefly later on about the effects of reheating , etc . )",
    "the normalization in implies that ( @xmath53 ) are measured when @xmath54 .",
    "this equation can be integrated to determine @xmath55 $ ] in terms of the other parameters in the problem .",
    "we note that the friedman equations in and are invariant under the constant rescaling @xmath56 . therefore , we _ can not _ determine the numerical value of @xmath57 without an extra principle or assumption .",
    "this freedom is often used to set @xmath58 which will simplify algebraic expressions .",
    "( this issue happens to be more non - trivial than one would have normally assumed , and we make some comments about this  as well as an alternative description of friedmann geometry  in appendix [ appen : frwrhop ] ; but it is not relevant as far as our main discussion is concerned . )",
    "the text book parameterization described above is convenient for the observational study of the universe because standard observational results are quoted in terms of the parameters ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "theoretically , describes a four - parameter family of evolutionary histories for different possible universes and our universe is selected out of this infinite set by the specific values for these parameters . at present",
    ", these values are thought of as inputs from observations .",
    "a key agenda item for future research in cosmology will be to understand why the various parameters which describe our universe have the specific values they have .",
    "the above parametrization is useless for this purpose because the parameters ( @xmath59 ) are tied to the current epoch and have no invariant significance .",
    "( for example , any physical theory that predicts , say , @xmath60 , can not be taken seriously because this value has no invariant significance ! ) to see this more clearly , let us consider cosmologists working at the epoch @xmath61 ( corresponding to @xmath62 ) .",
    "they would have defined the usual quantities @xmath63 , the critical density @xmath64 , and the density parameters @xmath65 and would have written the friedmann equation ( for the post inflationary era ) in terms of the three variables @xmath66 $ ] as : @xmath67 + \\frac{a_*^3\\oms}{a^3 } + \\frac{a_*^4\\ors}{a^4}\\right ] \\label{frw}\\ ] ] ( the spatial flatness of the universe expressed by remains valid at all epochs because @xmath50 is a constant independent of the epoch . )",
    "thus , the observers working at different epochs , labeled by @xmath68 , will use different sets of `` constants '' given by @xmath66 $ ] defined with respect to their preferred epoch @xmath61 .",
    "they might also set @xmath69 for convenience .",
    "clearly , such a description hides the fact that all these observers are describing the same universe !    to discuss the cosmic parameters that select our particular universe from the set of all possible universes , we need to rewrite or in terms of a set of constants which are epoch independent and have the same value at all times ,",
    "so that they are _ characteristic numbers describing our universe_. in other words , it will be theoretically more useful to describe our universe in terms of certain constants , the numerical values of which are the same , as measured by any cosmologist working at any epoch .",
    "our first task is to construct such an epoch invariant parameterization of the friedmann evolution .",
    "there are several ways to do this and we will choose a procedure which is most suited for our purpose .",
    "we begin by noting that , in the total energy density @xmath70 , the part contributed by the  [ viz .",
    ", @xmath71 is already epoch - independent .",
    "cosmologists working at any epoch will attribute the same numerical value to this quantity .",
    "this is also true regarding the constant energy density @xmath7 during the inflationary phase ( and the corresponding value for @xmath72 ) .",
    "the remaining part @xmath73 can be conveniently written as @xmath74\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the density of matter ( or radiation ) at the epoch @xmath76 at which they are equal . from it",
    "is obvious that numerical value of @xmath8 is independent of the epoch @xmath77 ( since @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath80 is also epoch - independent because it can be defined by the condition : @xmath81 which shows that it is also a characteristic number for our universe .",
    "the density @xmath8 allows us to define the temperature @xmath82 of the cmb at the epoch @xmath76 by the standard relation @xmath83 .",
    "clearly , all cosmologists will attribute the same numerical value to @xmath84 as well .",
    "the friedmann equation can now be written entirely in terms of the four epoch - independent parameters @xmath85 as : @xmath86\\qquad \\text{(after inflation)}\\\\   8\\pi g \\rho_{\\rm inf } /3",
    "\\qquad \\text{(during inflation } )   \\end{cases }   \\label{aaeq}\\ ] ] as in the previous case , this equation can be integrated to determine the function @xmath87 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath88 is an _ epoch invariant normalization _ of the expansion factor , unlike a choice like @xmath58 or @xmath69 .",
    "all cosmologists working at any epoch can agree to set the expansion factor to unity when the temperature of the cmb had a value @xmath84 .",
    "it is sometimes convenient , in what follows , to use the variable @xmath89 and introduce the epoch - independent ratio : @xmath90   \\label{a7}\\ ] ] in terms of which the friedmann equation ( after inflation ) becomes : @xmath91   \\label{a6}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the epoch invariant normalization and @xmath94 ( describing radiation and matter ) are better understood theoretically compared to @xmath95 , it is prudent to use the equality epoch of matter and radiation densities for our normalization . ]",
    "@xmath88 .    both and ( unlike ) describe the cosmic evolution in terms of epoch - independent parameters .",
    "equation ( [ a6 ] ) does it in terms of the set @xmath96 $ ] while does it in terms of the set @xmath97 $ ] when we set @xmath98 .",
    "we will use either set depending on context .",
    "since the evolution of the universe can be described in terms of three densities @xmath97 $ ] , the set of all universes forms a three parameter family of evolutionary histories . of these",
    ", our universe is selected out by specific values for these three densities .",
    "observationally , we now know that these densities are given by @xmath100 ^ 4 \\nonumber\\\\   \\rho_\\lambda & = & [ ( 2.26\\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{-3 }   \\text{ev}]^4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of these , the post inflationary era of the universe  which is directly accessible to many different cosmological probes  is described by the two densities @xmath8 and @xmath95 . using natural units @xmath101 and the planck length @xmath102",
    ", we can construct two dimensionless numbers out of these densities .",
    "for the cosmological constant , we get @xmath103 which has led to the cosmological constant `` problem '' for @xmath0 since this extremely tiny value for a dimensionless number is supposed to indicate fine - tuning .",
    "but , on the other hand , @xmath8 leads to the corresponding dimensionless number @xmath104 which is hardly commented upon in the literature !",
    "( in fact , it comes as a bit of surprise to many cosmologists that @xmath105 is indeed such a tiny number ! )",
    "as fine - tuning goes , @xmath106 is not much better than @xmath107 for a dimensionless number .",
    "therefore , if we think the value of @xmath108 is a `` problem '' , then we should also be concerned with the value of @xmath105 .",
    "the conventional wisdom worries about @xmath108 but not about @xmath105 because of two reasons : ( 1 ) there is a feeling that the cosmological constant is `` somehow '' related to quantum gravity and hence the value @xmath108 might have some physical significance .",
    "( 2 ) there is a hope that the numerical value of @xmath8 can possibly be determined entirely by high energy physics . from the definition , we can relate @xmath8 to the ratio between the number density of the photons and the number density of matter particles : @xmath109^{4 } \\label{heprhoeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 ( in cgs units ) is a numerical constant , @xmath111 are the current number densities of dark matter particles , baryons and photons respectively and @xmath112 are the masses of the dark matter particle and baryon .",
    "we expect the physics at ( possibly ) guts scale to determine the ratios @xmath113 and @xmath114 and specify @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "indeed , we have a framework to calculate these numbers in different models of high energy physics ( for a review , see @xcite ) though none of these models can be considered at present as compelling .",
    "since a framework for understanding @xmath8 exists , it is not considered to be as mysterious as @xmath95 . in fact , the numerical value of @xmath7 is also expected to be obtained by high energy physics models , thus leaving @xmath95 as the only constant to be determined .",
    "the small value of @xmath105 , or equivalently the small value of @xmath117 remains the key problem of which we will be concerned with in this review .",
    "incidentally , one can rephrase the cosmological constant problem _ completely in classical terms _ without introducing @xmath118 or the planck length @xmath119 .",
    "we first note that there is _ no _ fine - tuning problem for the cosmological constant in the classical , _ pure gravity _",

    "it is not possible to form a dimensionless number from these three constants and hence it is not meaningful to talk about fine - tuning in the context of classical , matter - free gravity .",
    "the situation changes when we add matter to the fray .",
    "since the matter sector is characterized by @xmath8 , we now have the dimensionless constant can be determined at any epoch and , of course , it is convenient to determine it using the current values of @xmath122 in .",
    "the precise values and error bars dependent on the observations one uses and the kind of priors assumed for statistical analysis ; for our purpose , the above values , which are consistent with most observations , are adequate . ]",

    "in fact , all the standard lore in cosmology depends only on this ratio because the post - inflationary evolution of this universe is completely determined by this number .",
    "this fine tuning is purely classical and does not require @xmath125 or @xmath119 .",
    "curiously enough , we do not have any direct explanation for the smallness of this number .    to summarize , the family of friedmann universes we are interested in can be parameterized by a set of three densities @xmath126 $ ] or  equivalently by the three dimensionless numbers @xmath127 of these",
    ", we hope that the physics at , say , the guts scale will eventually enable us to estimate the value of @xmath128 and thus understand the inflationary phase .",
    "the value of @xmath8 , as we said before , can also be determined , in principle , from high energy physics through .",
    "the worst case , of course , is that of the  related to the value of @xmath108 . in the literature",
    ", there have been several attempts to `` solve '' the cosmological constant `` problem '' , some of which we rapidly overview in the next section .",
    "we then explain why these approaches miss some key ingredients required for a viable solution to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "having done so , we will present a framework which addresses this question fairly comprehensively .",
    "the issues related to the  have been discussed extensively in the literature and there are several excellent reviews @xcite from different perspectives .",
    "the purpose of this short section is to provide a brief summary of some of these approaches in order to orient the reader toward the discussions in the later sections of this review .",
    "it is important to realize that the introduction of the  is closely related to the breaking of a symmetry originally present in the matter lagrangian . in",
    "flat spacetime , the dynamics of matter fields is described by a lagrangian @xmath129 , the variation of which leads to the matter field equations .",
    "the addition of a constant ( @xmath130 ) to @xmath131 in the form @xmath132 is a symmetry of the theory in the sense that the equations of motion for the matter variables @xmath133 remain invariant under this transformation .",
    "this continues to be a symmetry even in a _ fixed _ curved geometry in which the matter lagrangian could be taken as @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the covariant derivative ; the matter equations of motion still remain invariant under the transformation @xmath132 .",
    "the situation changes drastically when we treat gravity , described by the spacetime metric , as a dynamical field and add an action functional for gravity as well , to obtain : @xmath136+\\int d^4x \\g \\left(\\frac{r}{16\\pi g}\\right)\\ ] ] in this case , the transformation @xmath132 leads to the action @xmath137 in which the term @xmath138 $ ] couples the constant to the metric @xmath139 and changes the equations of motion .",
    "the action in can be written in the equivalent form : @xmath140\\ ] ] where @xmath141 can be interpreted as the .",
    "obviously , if we add _ two _ constants to the action , by changing @xmath142 and @xmath132 , the physics cares only for the total @xmath143 and it makes no sense to talk about a separate  in the gravitational sector _ as well as _ a shift in the matter lagrangian .",
    "in short , the introduction of a  can always be thought of as the addition of a constant to the matter sector of the lagrangian leaving the gravitational action untouched .",
    "when the spacetime metric is treated as a dynamical variable , this breaks a symmetry originally present in the matter sector .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "any shift in the matter lagrangian is physically equivalent to the introduction of a .",
    "for example , when the universe cools through the energy scale of , say , the electro - weak phase transition , the higgs potential picks up a large shift in its energy and thus introduces a .",
    "the numerical value of this  is very large compared to what is observed in the universe today thereby requiring a careful fine - tuning to cancel most of it .",
    "this is one of the key problems in understanding the . in the literature ,",
    "one often comes across emphasis on the divergent contribution to  from vacuum fluctuations , loop corrections leading to the running of the , etc .",
    "while all these effects could contribute to the , it must be stressed that there is a difficulty _ even at the tree - level _ of the theory due to the higgs mechanism operating at , say , the electro - weak state .",
    "the past attempts to tackle the  problem were quite diverse . these include ( but are certainly not limited to ) the following : ( a ) invoking some symmetry which can be violated by a non - zero  @xcite , thereby requiring it to be zero .",
    "one then needs to break the symmetry weakly to get the observed value of the .",
    "( b ) making the  evolve in time , often as a function of an expansion rate : i.e. , @xmath144 .",
    "this could be done either in a deterministic fashion ( see , for e.g. , @xcite ) or in a stochastic manner @xcite .",
    "( c ) using some of the concepts which have been successful in condensed matter physics in related contexts @xcite .",
    "( d ) attempting to cancel the  using some back - reaction effect which can act as a self - regulatory mechanism for the .",
    "these could arise from different sources including the instabilities in the de sitter space @xcite .",
    "( e ) screening of the  by physical processes @xcite .",
    "( f ) renormalization group effects leading to the running of @xmath0 @xcite finally giving the correct value . (",
    "g ) introducing non - local or acausal modification of the gravitational action or theories @xcite .",
    "for example , the  can be thought of as a lagrange multiplier for preserving the total four - volume while varying the action , which suggests that the value of the lagrange multiplier needs to be determined using the four - volume .",
    "( h ) restricting the class of metrics over which the action is varied to get the field equations .",
    "for example , if we postulate that @xmath145 should be held fixed while varying the action , @xmath0 will decouple from gravity @xcite .    as we said before",
    ", we will not provide a comparative study of the merits and short - comings of all these procedures since such discussions can be found in numerous places in the literature . however , it is fair to say that none of these approaches or their variants have provided a satisfactory solution to the  problem .",
    "we believe this is because these approaches : ( i ) address the  problem somewhat in isolation and ( ii ) treat the metric tensor as a dynamical variable describing the gravitational field .",
    "we shall now describe what is _ really _ required to solve the so called  problem .",
    "0.2 in    as mentioned before , the  has a bad press and several `` problems '' have been attributed to it in the literature .",
    "a careful scrutiny of these issues reveals that the  problem(s ) essentially arise(s ) from two  and only two  _ distinct _ , independent , ingredients which we will describe below .",
    "consider any theory of gravity interacting with matter fields and described by a total lagrangian @xmath146 + l_m [ g_{ab},\\phi_a]$ ] .",
    "here , @xmath139 is the metric tensor which is supposed to describe the gravitational degrees of freedom and @xmath147 symbolically denotes all other matter degrees of freedom .",
    "varying the action obtained from this lagrangian with respect to the matter degrees of freedom @xmath148 will lead to the equations of motion for matter in the presence of a given gravitational field .",
    "similarly , varying the metric tensor will lead to gravitational field equations of the form @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a geometric variable obtained from the variation of @xmath151 ( e.g. , it is the einstein tensor @xmath152 in general relativity , but could be a more complicated tensor in a general theory of gravity like , e.g. , in lovelock models @xcite ) and @xmath153 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter obtained from the variation of @xmath131 with respect to @xmath139 .",
    "we also note , for future reference , that the scalar nature of the lagrangians lead to the generalized bianchi identity ( @xmath154 ) and the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath155 in any theory .",
    "these variational principles leading to the equations of motion for matter and gravity , contain an important peculiarity .",
    "the equations of motion for the matter sector are invariant under the addition of a constant to the matter lagrangian .",
    "that is , the transformation @xmath156 is a symmetry of the matter sector in the sense that the matter equations of motion remain invariant under the transformation in .",
    "( we will assume that the matter lagrangian is _ not _ supersymmetric invariant in the regime we are interested in ; supersymmetry is the only symmetry that prevents the addition of a constant to the lagrangian . )",
    "though the addition of a constant to a lagrangian is usually not thought of as a `` symmetry '' principle , it definitely should be , because this mathematical operation does leave the equations of motion invariant ; in that sense , it is no different from any other mathematical operation , like for e.g. , the lorentz transformations which leave the equations of motion invariant",
    ". usually , one constructs the lagrangian ( or , more precisely , the action ) in such a way that it itself remains manifestly invariant under all the relevant symmetry transformations ( like , for e.g. , the lorentz transformation ) .",

    "however , it can be achieved by constructing a set of gravitational field equations which are invariant under the transformation in but allow the inclusion of a as an _ integration constant _ in their solutions .",

    "thus , if we can construct a theory of gravity in which the field equations reduce to those in , then the first two requirements for solving the  problem would have been achieved .",
    "the above demand turns out to be extremely strong , and it has important consequences which are often overlooked in attempts to `` solve '' the problem . to see this , consider any theory of gravity interacting with matter , which satisfies the following three conditions :    1 .",

    "the degrees of freedom are the basic entities in physics .",
    "one possible way of introducing the holographic principle is to relate the number of degrees of freedom @xmath385 residing in a bulk region @xmath386 of space and the number of degrees of freedom @xmath387 on the boundary @xmath388 of this region . for a surface of area @xmath190 ,",
    "the surface degrees of freedom are counted as @xmath389 where @xmath349 acts as a fundamental area scale .",

    "the dynamics of the spatially flat universe can be characterized by three densities : @xmath5 and @xmath95 , in addition to one undetermined overall normalization constant for @xmath14 which could be taken to be the value of the expansion factor at the epoch when @xmath476 . in standard cosmology",
    ", there is no inter - relationship between the three densities @xmath5 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is generally believed that high energy physics models will eventually provide a first - principles estimation of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "but we have no clue so far as to which physical principle determines the value of @xmath6 .",
    "we have shown that there exists a characteristic number @xmath173 for the universe ( `` '' ) which counts the number of length scales which enter the hubble radius during the radiation / matter dominated phase .",
    "we have argued in sec.[sec : cosmin ] that this conserved number can act as a unifying link between the early inflationary phase , the radiation / matter dominated phase and the late - time acceleration phase . for a generic universe described by an unrelated set of three densities",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath95 , the parameter  can take any arbitrary value .",
    "_ one of our key results is the discovery that  for our universe is equal to @xmath171 to a high degree of accuracy . _",
    "we strongly believe that this is unlikely to be an accident and demands an explanation .    if this result",
    ", @xmath308 is raised to a status of a postulate , it can be used to determine the numerical value of @xmath95 in terms of the other two densities @xmath8 and @xmath7 ( see ) which  as we said before  are very likely to be determined by high energy physics . in other words",
    ", we now have a paradigm in hand in which all the numbers characterizing the universe are determined from first principles .",
    "there is no a priori reason for such an idea to give results consistent with observations , which , in fact , happens only for a narrow range of inflationary energy scales .",
    "as mentioned in the first item in sec.[sec : disc ] , this range is likely to be constrained only by a factor of about 15 even if we take into account uncertainties due to inflationary reheating . in any case , given a detailed model of inflation , the procedure for calculating  is well defined and one could check for the consistency of the idea when inflationary models are on firmer footing .    such a procedure to determine the numerical value of @xmath95 has deeper implication for the structure of gravitational theories . in conventional models ,",
    "the value of @xmath95 can change when an arbitrary constant is added to the matter lagrangian . in such a case , any physical principle to determine the numerical value of @xmath95 becomes dubious , since the value of the  that acts as the source for gravity can be changed by adding a constant to the matter lagrangian . as we have pointed out in sec.[sec : nscc ] , this _ is a generic problem _ in a large class of attempts to `` solve '' the  problem and the  problem can be really solved _ only if _ we have two separate key ingredients in our model :    \\(a ) the gravitational _ field equations _ must be invariant under the addition of a constant to the matter lagrangian ( which results in the modification of the zero level of energy , as in ) .",
    "\\(b ) at the same time , the _ solutions _ to the gravitational field equations must allow for the inclusion of a , and we must provide a new principle to determine its numerical value .",
    "it was known for a long time @xcite that the emergent gravity paradigm , leading to the field equations of the form in , takes care of the ingredient ( a ) above .",
    "what was lacking was a new physical principle which could be used to determine the value of the , which arises as an integration constant to the solution of . here",
    ", we have provided this second ingredient ( b ) in the form of our postulate @xmath319 .    as mentioned in sec.[sec : coscon ] , it is difficult to reconcile a result like @xmath308 within the conventional cosmological paradigm which treats the dynamics of the universe simply as a solution to the gravitational field equations .",
    "in fact , the conventional approach does not provide satisfactory answers to several other conceptual questions one could raise about our universe .",
    "for example , one can not even answer a simple question as to `` why does the universe expand '' within the context of standard classical cosmology @xcite .",
    "since gravitational field equations are invariant under time reversal , one can write down the time - reversed solutions to the friedmann equations describing a contracting universe . all that we can prove is that _ if _ the universe is expanding today ( which is taken as an observational input ) _ then _ it would have been expanding in the past  though the initial singularity prevents us from meaningfully setting `` initial '' conditions to choose this solution .",
    "further , in conventional cosmology , the universe seems to have evolved _",
    "spontaneously _ from a quantum mechanical state to a nearly classical state .",
    "it is not possible for a normal system to make a _ spontaneous _ transition from a quantum to a classical state ( in a rigorously defined sense , in terms of the wigner function ) if its evolution is governed by a bounded hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "finally , the friedmann model breaks lorentz invariance and chooses a preferred lorentz frame ( in which the cmb is isotropic ) , again because the solution to the field equations breaks the full symmetry of the field equations .",
    "all these features seem to suggest @xcite that we should describe cosmic expansion ( and derive the friedmann equations ) from another physical principle , rather than treat them as arising as a solution to the gravitational field equations .",
    "we have argued in sec.[sec : coscon ] that the concept of holographic equipartition provides such an alternate principle to describe cosmic expansion .",
    "this concept uses the hubble radius fairly crucially and also identifies @xmath171 as a primordial constant counting the number of degrees of freedom on a sphere of radius @xmath119 .",
    "both these ingredients go well with @xmath477 acting as a fundamental physical principle . though the ideas presented in sec.[sec : coscon ] of the review are still at a preliminary stage compared to the rest of the review , but they hold the promise of providing a novel and fruitful description of our cosmos .",

    "the description of the friedmann geometry in uses the expansion factor @xmath14 , while einstein s equations , , determine @xmath14 only up to a scaling factor .",
    "this has some interesting implications which are not adequately discussed in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to highlight these features .",
    "there exists a different way of describing the geometry of the universe which is quite elegant and interesting . to introduce this description",
    ", we will proceed as follows : consider a homogeneous , isotropic 3-dimensional space which , as we know , can be characterized completely by the spatial curvature . as in the main text , we shall assume that the spatial curvature is zero .",
    "this implies that the @xmath420 constant sections of the universe are euclidean .",
    "we can now introduce a radial coordinate @xmath231 in this euclidean 3-space by the relation @xmath478 where @xmath190 is the proper area of the @xmath420 constant , @xmath479 constant surface .",
    "it then follows that the angular part of the metric has the form @xmath480=r^2d\\omega^2 $ ] .",
    "next , we introduce the energy density @xmath404 and @xmath481 as _ measured by the fundamental geodesic observers _ ( who see the 3-space as maximally symmetric ) through the relations @xmath482 where @xmath483 is the projection tensor orthogonal to the four - velocity @xmath484 of the geodesic observers and @xmath153 is the source energy - momentum tensor . normally , to obtain the metric tensor , we now need to solve the einstein s equations . however , _ this is unnecessary in the friedmann universe _ and the metric can be written out just in terms of @xmath404 and @xmath481 , in the form : @xmath485 ^ 2 + r^2 d\\omega^2    \\label{prhometric}\\ ] ] in the above metric , we are using the energy density in the universe @xmath404 itself as a locally defined time coordinate ! the equation of state for matter gives @xmath481 as a function of @xmath404 , and thus the line element in is completely determined in terms of the ` time coordinate ' @xmath404 . the fact that the friedmann geometry can be described directly in terms of source variables without solving any differential equation is a nice feature which does not seem to have been noticed before in the literature .",
    "if we calculate the einstein tensor for the metric in , we will find that it satisfies einstein s equations identically , with a source having energy density @xmath404 and isotropic pressure @xmath481 as measured by fundamental geodesic observers .",
    "it is easy to connect this up with the more conventional description . to do this",
    ", we introduce a new time coordinate by the definition : @xmath486 using the geodesic equation for the metric in , one can explicitly verify that @xmath27 is the proper time of geodesic clocks in the spacetime .",
    "inverting this relation , we can express @xmath404 as a function of @xmath27 , and using the equation of state , also obtain @xmath481 as another function of @xmath27 . at this stage",
    ", it is also convenient to introduce the function @xmath487 by the definition : @xmath488 where we have used to obtain the second equality .",
    "the metric now takes a simpler form in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath487 and is given by @xmath489 in this form , the lapse function of the metric is unity , the shift function ( in cartesian coordinates ) is @xmath490 and the three - metric is trivial ( @xmath491 ) .",
    "there is wide - spread folklore ( which is incorrect in the strict sense ) that the dynamics of spacetime is encoded in the three - metric and the lapse and shift functions are purely kinematic in structure .",
    "we see that the dynamics of our universe can be _ entirely encoded _ by the shift function with the lapse and the 3-metric being trivially unity .",
    "we can , of course , transform the metric in to the usual form in by introducing a new function @xmath14 and a coordinate @xmath334 by the relations : @xmath492 this equation clearly shows that for a given @xmath487 determined by the source , the corresponding @xmath14 is not unique and is arbitrary with respect to a scaling by a constant .",
    "it is important to realize that such a scaling freedom does not exist if we use the coordinates in or to describe the friedmann geometry .",
    "if we rescale @xmath77 , then the second equation in tells us that @xmath334 is _ automatically _ rescaled leaving @xmath231 fixed .",
    "we stress that @xmath231 has a direct geometrical meaning @xmath493 in terms of the area of the @xmath420 constant , @xmath479 constant surface .",
    "so , the real origin of the scaling freedom in @xmath14 is from the fact that the geometrical description in or cares only for @xmath487 and that the @xmath14 arises through the definition in the first equation in .",
    "these facts also allow us to look at the notion of ` expansion ' of the universe somewhat differently .",
    "the description of friedmann geometry in the coordinates in or does _ not _ make the 3-geometry expand !",
    "the metric of the @xmath420 constant surface in is just the flat euclidean metric with a constant 3-volume and the proper area of the @xmath420 constant , @xmath479 constant surface is _ independent _ of time .",
    "in contrast , if we use the standard coordinates in , the volume of the @xmath420 constant surface varies as @xmath494 and the area of the @xmath420 constant , @xmath479 constant surface varies as @xmath495 .",
    "_ clearly , the ` expansion ' of the universe depends on the coordinates used to describe friedmann geometry .",
    "_ what is more , @xmath496 vanishes at the hubble radius when we use the coordinate system in , which attribute greater importance to the hubble radius .",
    "the key difference between the two coordinates is the following . the world lines with",
    "@xmath497 held constant are _ not _ geodesics while the world lines with @xmath498 held constant are indeed geodesics .",
    "so , if we use as our metric , the geodesics describing fundamental observers are given by @xmath499 = \\text{constant}\\ ] ] since we believe galaxies are in geodesic motion in our universe , it is useful to use coordinates in which each galaxy has a constant value of @xmath498 rather than a constant value of @xmath497 .",
    "this is merely a question of convenience and not fundamental .",
    "the geometrical features of our universe ( like , e.g. redshift ) do not change under coordinate transformations , and we can indeed talk of all physical phenomena using the metric in without ever introducing the notion of an ` expanding ' universe .",
    "we hope to return to this issue in a future publication @xcite .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly comment on our assumption of @xmath500 in our calculations .",
    "if this assumption is relaxed , then the current value of the expansion factor , @xmath57 , is given by the relation @xmath501 where @xmath502 .",
    "if inflation lasts for a sufficiently large period , @xmath460 will be extremely tiny .",
    "even if we interpret the density of gravitational waves generated during inflation as contributing to deviation from the spatially flat friedmann model , we expect @xmath503 or so .",
    "when @xmath504 , the friedmann equation gets modified to the form : @xmath505\\label{frwcurv}\\ ] ] when @xmath460 is sufficiently small , the last term is dynamically negligible because the  dominates over it sufficiently early . to see this , note that the matter and dark energy densities are equal at @xmath506 where @xmath507 while the dark energy term and the last term in are equal at @xmath508 with @xmath509 therefore , the ratio @xmath510 is extremely small . in other words ,",
    "the dark energy starts dominating over curvature much before it dominates over the matter density .",
    "so , for all dynamical purposes , the curvature term is irrelevant in all phases of expansion for realistic values of @xmath460 arising from inflation .",
    "hence , we consider a spatially flat friedmann model throughout the main text .",
    "this appendix contains some of the calculations leading to the results in , , and in the main text .    to study the evolution of a spatially flat universe containing a cosmological constant , pressure - free matter ( which includes both dark matter and baryons ) and radiation ( which includes photons as well as any other relativistic species ) , one usually starts with the friedmann equation written in the form of .",
    "the friedmann equation can further be written in terms of variable @xmath334 , and the epoch - independent parameters @xmath511 and @xmath275 , as .    using this parameterization",
    ", we can now express the right hand side of in terms of [ @xmath512 .",
    "our postulate @xmath176 now gives a relationship among these parameters , inverting which we can express @xmath513 ( and thus the cosmological constant ) in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath275 , both of which , of course , can be specified independently of @xmath50 .",
    "this is the strategy we will adopt .",
    "we begin by determining @xmath252 and @xmath254 , corresponding to @xmath236 and @xmath235 in .",
    "it is easy to see that the condition @xmath251/da = 0 $ ] , which determines @xmath252 , allows us to express @xmath252 as a function of @xmath275 , say , as @xmath514 , where the function @xmath268 satisfies the quartic equation :      on the other hand , @xmath254 is determined by matching @xmath516 with the hubble constant during inflation , @xmath72 . since this occurs in the radiation dominated phase , we only need to retain the @xmath517 term in the right hand side of .",
    "this gives                      this is equivalent to the result quoted in the text : @xmath343;\\qquad   \\quad c(\\sigma ) = 6 ( r + 2)\\ , ( 3r+4)^{-2 } \\label{holy3app}\\ ] ] where @xmath231 satisfies the quartic equation @xmath311 .",
    "equivalently , we can express the above result for @xmath282 as : @xmath526 which is in the main text .    as we stressed before",
    ", @xmath275 is an epoch independent parameter defined through and its value is , of course , independent of @xmath50 , which we are trying to determine . since @xmath275 is epoch independent , we can determine its possible value and the range from current observations .",
    "the quartic equation requires numerical solution and the result is plotted in .    the quartic equation ,",
    "can be solved approximately in two limits , viz . ,",
    "@xmath527 and @xmath528 . in the first case ( @xmath527 )",
    "the approximate solution to the quartic in is given by @xmath529 . in this limit , to the same order of accuracy , becomes @xmath530 which can be rewritten as      it is easy to verify that this limit corresponds to a purely radiation dominated universe with @xmath532 . as mentioned earlier , our expression for @xmath0 can _ only _ depend on @xmath533 and @xmath534 through @xmath275 ; when @xmath527 , this dependence drops out .",
    "raising both sides of the above equation to the third power , we obtain : @xmath537 substituting @xmath538 , @xmath539 , @xmath540 , and @xmath541 into the above equation , we obtain the relation between the three densities @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 as quoted in : @xmath542    high energy physics models will eventually determine the inflationary energy density @xmath7 , and the density at matter - radiation equality , @xmath8 .",
    "given these two numbers , and our postulate that @xmath543 , ( i.e. , @xmath308 ) , we can determine @xmath6 from the above equation , and thereby , the cosmological constant .",

    "<S> the numerical value of this integration constant can be related to another dimensionless number ( called ) that counts the number of modes inside a hubble volume that cross the hubble radius during the radiation and the matter dominated epochs of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent gravity paradigm suggests that  has the numerical value @xmath3 , which , in turn , leads to the correct , observed value of the cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> further , the emergent gravity paradigm provides an alternative perspective on cosmology and interprets the expansion of the universe itself as a quest towards holographic equipartition . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of this novel and alternate description of cosmology . </S>"
