    "past studies have shown the warm ionized medium ( wim ) to be a significant component of the ism , especially in the halos of disk galaxies ( reynolds 1993 ; hoopes , walterbos , & rand 1999 ; rand 1996 ; rossa & dettmar 2000 ; dettmar 1998 ) . in the milky way ,",
    "the wim has a mass surface density about one - third that of h i , an ionization power requirement equal to the supernovae rate , and a characteristic scale height of 1 kpc ( reynolds 1993 ; haffner , reynolds , & tufte 1999 ) .",
    "although the details of how the wim is ionized and heated are not well understood yet , early - type stars seem to be the biggest contenders for providing the bulk of the ionizing photons .",
    "dove , shull , & ferrara ( 2000 ) ; dove & shull ( 1994 ) ; and miller & cox ( 1993 ) have studied how o - star radiation can leak from the plane to ionize the large expanse occupied by the wim .",
    "however , we will show below that b - stars may also be a significant contributer to the halo ionization field .",
    "the problem of lyman continuum propagation through neutral gas is somewhat easier if these more widely distributed stars can contribute .    aided by modern detector technology",
    ", several groups have initiated intensive programs to characterize the global details of the ionized content of galaxies ( also called diffuse ionized gas ",
    "in addition to the velocity - resolved all - sky survey described here , three large - area imaging surveys are also in progress . a southern survey with arc - minute resolution has been completed by gaustad , mccullough , & van buren ( 1996 ; mccullough , these proceedings ) .",
    "dennison , simonetti , & topasna ( 1998 ) have been imaging the northern sky with similar resolution . a high - resolution ( @xmath6 )",
    "survey of the galactic plane and magellanic clouds is also underway by parker & phillips ( 1998 ) .",
    "here we describe the results of the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) northern sky survey , the first deep ( @xmath7 r ; 1",
    "r = @xmath8 photons @xmath9 s@xmath2 ster@xmath2 ) , velocity - resolved survey of the wim in our galaxy .",
    "the northern portion of the wham sky survey contains nearly 37,300 spectra with 12 km s@xmath2 resolution , each representing the spatially integrated emission from a one - degree patch on the sky .",
    "the survey covers the northern sky above @xmath10 with a beam spacing of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "each spectrum covers a 200 km s@xmath2 spectral interval centered near the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . with our spectral resolution",
    ", we are able to remove the bright geocoronal h@xmath0 line and several very faint atmospheric lines present in every spectrum . these cleaned spectra allow us to detect very faint extended sources ( i@xmath13 = 0.1 r ; em @xmath14 @xmath4 pc ) and will allow us to absolutely calibrate the wham survey .",
    "more details of the wham instrument and the survey strategy can be found in tufte ( 1997 ) and haffner ( 1999 ) .",
    "the nearly completed ( 99% ) northern sky survey is displayed in figure  [ fig : allsky ] .",
    "as can been seen , very few regions exist where we do not detect at least 0.1 r of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "much of the intensity variation at high latitudes is real although the final phase of intensity calibrations has not yet been applied to the data presented here . to illustrate the power of this new survey we present two new discoveries here : the first map of the ionized component of an intermediate velocity cloud ( ivc ) and the detection of several faint , diffuse h ii regions .",
    "wakker ( 2000 ) recently separated out the h i intermediate velocity complex k ( previously classified with complex c ) centered near @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : compk ] shows an image of the h@xmath0 emission from wham and contours of 21 cm emission from the leiden - dwingeloo h i survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) toward complex k.    the h@xmath0 boundary matches the @xmath17 @xmath9 contour quite closely over most of the cloud ; however , the peaks in each emission component do not correspond as well .",
    "the h@xmath0 intensity over the face of the cloud only varies by about a factor of 2 : 0.1 to 0.2 r or em @xmath18 0.2 to 0.4 @xmath9 pc .",
    "the total @xmath19 over the face of the cloud varies from about 1 to @xmath20 @xmath9 , resulting in an extinction correction to the observed h@xmath0 flux of at most @xmath21 if all this neutral material is actually between us and the cloud .    as reviewed by wakker ( 2000 ) ,",
    "little absorption line data directly toward complex k exists at this time and thus little information about its distance .",
    "there is a firm upper limit established though since the cloud has been seen in absorption toward nearby m13 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "carretta , et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have recently calculate the distance modulus to m13 to be 14.44 mag , setting an upper limit on the distance of the portion of complex k near m13 at 7.7 kpc .",
    "if the cloud is ionized by an external photoionizing source the incident lyman continuum flux on the cloud surface can be estimated ( see tufte , reynolds , & haffner 1998 )",
    ". ignoring the complexity of geometry but applying the maximum extinction correction above , we find that the incident flux of ionizing photons , @xmath23 photons @xmath9 s@xmath2 for the brightest h@xmath0 regions in complex k. bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 1999 ) have produced a model of the ionizing flux in the galactic halo .",
    "we find that our observed h@xmath0 intensity is consistent with that expected from their model in the direction of complex k for distances @xmath24 kpc from the sun ( bland - hawthorn 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "as noted above , the problem of ionizing the wim layer becomes somewhat easier if o stars in the plane are aided by another , more widely distributed population .",
    "reynolds ( 1985 ) mapped a large , low - density h  ii region around @xmath0 vir ( spica ) , a b1iii - iv + b2 v system . in figure",

    "+   +    [ tab : hii ]    the likely sources for these regions are summarized in table  [ tab : hii ] .",
    "we estimate the physical diameter of each region when the distance to the source is known . in these cases ,",
    "the final column lists the minimum lyman continuum luminosity needed to sustain the observed h@xmath0 flux : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the distance to the region , @xmath42 is the @xmath43 intensity emitted by the solid angle @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the fraction of @xmath43 photons produced per lyman continuum photon ( 0.47 at 8000 k ; martin 1988 ) , and @xmath46 is the extinction correction factor .",
    "background emission from the wim ( estimated from outside the region ) is subtracted so that the @xmath42 used in this calculation is ( presumably ) emission only from the h ii region .",
    "we emphasize that our estimate of @xmath27 is a lower limit for two reasons .",
    "first , although many of these regions appear to be circular , we can not be sure that all the lyman continuum radiation from the source is absorbed by the local gas forming the h  ii region .",
    "second , we do not apply an extinction correction here ( _ i.e. _   @xmath47 ) .",
    "an ongoing wham survey of h@xmath48 will directly provide the extinction correction in the future .",
    "the h ii region displayed in figure  [ fig : hii]g deserves special mention .",
    "current catalogs list no candidate source near the center of this region .",
    "the only two reasonable candidates within a 5  radius of the center of the region are phl 6783 ( sdo ) and ngc 246 ( op ; pn ) . on the far side of the ionized nebula from these sources ( @xmath49 to 140 , @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) sits an h  i cloud whose velocity matches the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we interpret this seeming coincidence as evidence that one of these sources ( most likely phl 6783 from the geometry ) is ionizing the face of this h  i cloud",
    ".    however , the picture may be even a bit more interesting .",
    "the proper motion of phl 6783 ( @xmath52 mas yr@xmath2 , @xmath53 mas yr@xmath2 ; @xmath54 mas yr@xmath2 , @xmath55 mas yr@xmath2 ; hg et al .",
    "2000 ) indicates that it passed through the peak h@xmath0 of the region approximately @xmath56 years ago .",
    "the central star of ngc 246 also has a proper motion ( @xmath57 mas yr@xmath2 , @xmath58 mas yr@xmath2 ; @xmath59 mas yr@xmath2 , @xmath60 mas yr@xmath2 ; hg et al . 2000 ) that suggests it was just a degree south of this peak @xmath61 years ago .",
    "the h ii region is slightly elongated along these proper motion vectors ( both of which also eventually intersect the h   i cloud ) and is almost directly aligned with that of phl 6783 . with such proper motion vectors , there is a possibility that the h   ii region is no longer being actively ionized . in this slightly more complicated scenario , phl 6783 still seems to be the best candidate for the source since its proper motion vector direction and length are best suited to have recently ionized the region .",
    "wham has completed a full spectral survey of the northern sky ( @xmath62 ) in h@xmath0 .",
    "similar to the neutral component , filamentary substructure abounds in the ionized halo of the galaxy .",
    "exciting results from the faint h@xmath0 sky are abundant and we have presented two specific examples here .",
    "we have presented the first ionized map of an hvc or ivc .",
    "complex k contains an ionized component with @xmath63 ",
    "@xmath64 r that follows the shape of the neutral gas extremely well .",
    "we have also presented several new , faint h  ii regions , many of which appear to be ionized by early b stars .",
    "in addition , one of these regions is very likely an example of an isolated h  i cloud being ionized by a nearby sdo star ."
