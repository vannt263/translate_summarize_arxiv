    "the observation of the higgs boson with the mass around 125 gev  @xcite is a great achievement at lhc although we could not find any signals of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed value of the higgs boson mass is a mystery in itself , and we have been plagued by the problem known as _ naturalness _ of the electroweak scale . since the higgs boson mass is a dimension - full parameter , we come up with a question : why is the higgs boson mass around 125 gev against large quantum corrections ? to answer this question , we may need a new paradigm , where a promising candidate is supersymmetry . as an alternative , strong dynamics",
    "is an attractive scenario in which the higgs boson is regarded as a composite state . in this article",
    "we will focus on this possibility .",
    "an analogy with pion physics in qcd might be helpful to investigate the composite higgs scenario . in the meson spectrum in qcd ( neutral )",
    "pion is the lightest scalar particle since it is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) associated with the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "regarding the particle spectrum in the sm , the higgs boson is the lightest scaler particle .",
    "if we draw an analogy with the pion , the higgs boson could be identified as a pngb associated with spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry of more fundamental theory . in this point of view",
    "new resonance states are expected to appear above the higgs mass scale as is the case with the rho mesons in qcd . by remembering the broad width of the rho mesons , phase shifts of scattering amplitudes",
    "can be observed in the tail region of the rho meson mediated cross sections even if the scattering energy does not reach the resonance peak  @xcite .",
    "the same measurement can be applied in the composite higgs scenario if the second lightest resonance above the higgs mass scale has a relatively broad decay width .",
    "although direct observations of new particles can be a strong evidence of new physics , phase shift measurements would be useful in the case that new resonances have a broad width and collision energies are not sufficient to directly produce them . in this section",
    "we discuss a possibility to observe the phase shift at lhc .",
    "the expected new resonance couples to the higgs doublet field , and thus , the phase shift would appear in production processes of the longitudinally polarized weak gauge bosons .",
    "however , it is challenging to observe the longitudinal mode at lhc  @xcite .",
    "we alternatively utilize an interference effect between the longitudinal mode and the production modes of transversely polarized gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "let us focus on the process @xmath0 at lhc . in this process",
    "the squared amplitude can be written by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the production amplitude as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the scattering angle , the polarization of @xmath6 and that of @xmath7 , respectively . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are decay amplitudes of @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons , respectively , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the final state leptons coming from @xmath12 decay , respectively .",
    "as already mentioned , a phase shift can be induced in the production amplitude for @xmath13 , and thus we parametrize the phase shift @xmath14 by @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay amplitudes are proportional to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we therefore obtain the term proportional to @xmath14 through the interference term : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are some coefficients depending on other parameters .",
    "it turns out that the non - vanishing @xmath14 can be probed by @xmath21 and/or @xmath22 dependence of the final state leptons .",
    "it should be emphasized that , when we detect the final state charged lepton coming form @xmath6 decay , it is possible to measure @xmath21 dependence induced by non - vanishing @xmath14 even in the case of @xmath23 .    to see @xmath21 dependence , we utilize the quantity defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cross section for the case that the charged lepton coming from @xmath6 decay goes to `` above ( below ) '' the production plane . to avoid the misidentification of @xmath26-direction , the cross sections are given by integrating over @xmath27  .",

    "[ fig : pp ] shows the asymmetry @xmath28 as a function of phase shift @xmath14 at @xmath29 colliders .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines show the cases that the collision energy is set to be 14 tev , 30 tev and 100 tev , respectively . in the case of 14 tev lhc",
    "the maximal asymmetry @xmath30 appears around @xmath31 . the total cross section @xmath32 is then given by @xmath33 as shown in the right panel of the figure .",
    "when we have 300 fb@xmath34 of the integrated luminosity , the statistical error is about 3 % , and it is difficult to measure the asymmetry in this case .",
    "if we have , on the other hand , 3000 fb@xmath34 , the statistical error could be less than the asymmetry , and thus it might be possible to observe the asymmetry .     as a function of phase shift @xmath14 .",

    "let us discuss a relation between the phase shift @xmath14 and new resonance scale parametrized by its mass @xmath35 and decay width @xmath36 .",
    "in this section we concentrate on so - called minimal composite higgs model ( mchm )  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on global @xmath37 symmetry which is spontaneously broken into @xmath38 , and four ngbs are identified as the sm higgs doublet . in this model",
    "the gauge interaction of the higgs field is deviated form that of the sm prediction , which is given by @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the @xmath41-@xmath42-@xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) coupling in the sm .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are vacuum expectation value of the higgs field and the breaking scale of @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "although there are many variations of mchm according to matter representations  , the gauge interaction of the higgs field is completely determined by the coset space of @xmath48 , and thus it does not depend on the matter sector .",
    "the deviation of the @xmath41-@xmath42-@xmath42 coupling is responsible for the violation of perturbative unitarity at high energies , and lets a partial wave amplitude @xmath49 @xmath50 go outside the unitarity circle defined by @xmath51 ^ 2 + ( { \\rm im}[a_l]-1/2)^2\\leq ( 1/2)^2 .",

    "the imaginary part of @xmath59 can be written in terms of the real part of @xmath59 since the amplitude is on the unitarity circle .",
