    "we investigate the possibility that the weak interactions of the third generation of fermions are fundamentally different from the first and second family . in particular , we look at the gauge group su(2)@xmath7 su(2)@xmath8 u(1)@xmath2 where the first and second generations couple to su(2)@xmath9 and the third generation couples to su(2)@xmath10 .",
    "we call this model topflavor in analogy to the topcolor model @xcite . similar models of generational nonuniversality have been considered in the past @xcite ; here we consider the phenomenology of this gauge group and its potential to help explain the @xmath5 and @xmath6 problem .",
    "the left - handed first and second generation fermions form doublets under su(2)@xmath3 and are singlets under su(2)@xmath10 .",
    "conversely , the left - handed third generation fermions form doublets under su(2)@xmath10 and singlets under su(2)@xmath3 . all right handed fields are singlets under both su(2)@xmath3 and su(2)@xmath10 . with these representations",
    "the theory is anomaly free .",
    "the covariant derivative is @xmath11 where the @xmath12 belong to su(2)@xmath3 and @xmath13 belong to su(2)@xmath10 .",
    "the symmetry breaking in the theory is accomplished in two stages . in the first stage",
    "the su(2)@xmath14 su(2)@xmath10 is broken down to the su(2)@xmath15 of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing a higgs field @xmath16 that transforms as a doublet under each su(2 ) with the vev @xmath17    in the second stage the remaining symmetry ,",
    "su(2)@xmath18 u(1)@xmath19 , is broken down to u(1)@xmath20 .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing one or the other of two higgs fields that we call h@xmath3 and h@xmath10 . under ( su(2)@xmath3 , su(2)@xmath10 ,",
    "u(1)@xmath2 ) , h@xmath3 transforms as ( 2 , 1 , 1 ) and obtains a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath21 .",
    "h@xmath10 transforms as ( 1 , 2 , 1 ) and develops a vev @xmath22 .    the gauge bosons of the theory obtain mass through their interaction with the higgs fields .",
    "the fields in the current basis ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) are related to the fields in the mass basis ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) through an orthogonal matrix , * r * : @xmath29 where @xmath27 is the @xmath30 boson observed at present colliders and @xmath28 is called the `` heavy @xmath30 boson '' .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the weak mixing angle , and @xmath34 is an additional mixing angle such that the couplings of the theory are related to the electric charge by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    in the charged sector ,",
    "the mass eigenstates are denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath38 is the @xmath40 boson observed at present colliders and @xmath39 is termed the `` heavy @xmath40 boson '' .",
    "these are related to the current basis ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) by an orthogonal matrix , * r@xmath42 * : @xmath43    due to the enlarged gauge and higgs structure of this model , the couplings of the particles are modified from their sm values .",
    "these modifications are a function of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , but in the limit of @xmath47 , the sm couplings of the fermions are recovered .",
    "since the couplings of the particles are modified from the sm values , the phenomenology of this theory will be different from the sm .",
    "we investigate the case where the couplings are perturbative .",
    "this places a restriction on the allowed values that @xmath48 can take : the requirements that @xmath49 and @xmath50 give @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we restrict the possible values of the 3 new parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ) of the theory by requiring that the theoretical predictions for various processes agree with experimental values .",
    "three versions of the model are considered :    case 1 : : :    here we have just one higgs doublet , @xmath56 . in this case",
    "there are only two parameters beyond the sm : @xmath48    and @xmath46 or , more conveniently ,    @xmath48 and @xmath57 .",
    "case 2 : : :    here we take only the other higgs doublet , @xmath58 . in this    case",
    "there are again only two parameters beyond the sm :    @xmath48 and @xmath59 .",
    "case 3 : : :    here we include both @xmath58 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is    the general case where there are three parameters beyond the sm :    @xmath60 , @xmath45 , and    @xmath46 .    in case 1 ,",
    "we have that @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the topflavor model value of @xmath5 minus the sm value and similarly for @xmath6 . from the minus sign in eq .",
    "[ [ rb1 ] ] , we see that the topflavor model for this case gives a value for @xmath5 that is smaller than the sm value which means that case 1 gives a value for @xmath5 that is even farther from the experimental value than the sm .",
    "similarly , we see from eq .",
    "[ [ rc1 ] ] that the case 1 value for @xmath6 is larger than the sm value which , again , is in the opposite direction from the experimental value .",
    "thus case 1 does not provide an explanation for the @xmath5 or @xmath6 problems .",
    "we extensively considered the phenomenology of case 1 in another paper @xcite . in brief , the restriction imposed by various electroweak data and heavy boson searches at hadronic colliders is presented in fig .",
    "[ restrict ] .",
    "the region above the line represents the allowed region in parameter space while the region below the curve is disallowed .",
    "the left hand side of the curve for @xmath64 the largest restriction comes from @xmath65 and the experimental value for @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the right side of the curve ( @xmath67 ) is obtained from bounds set by search for a heavy w boson performed by the d0 collaboration at fermilab @xcite .",
    "for the second case , we have that @xmath68 and @xmath69 as we see from eqs .",
    "[ [ rb2 ] ] and [ [ rc2 ] ] , @xmath5 and @xmath6 for this case move in the right direction although constraints from other observables prevent this from being dramatic @xcite .    the third case , which is the general case with both higgs fields present , is considered in fig .",
    "[ restrict2 ] with the constraint @xmath70 ( as an example ) .",
    "the solid line displays the 90% confidence level lower bound from a fit to various electroweak observables ( but not @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and the @xmath71 lifetime @xcite .",
    "the effect of @xmath54 and @xmath55 on the couplings tends to cancel out at @xmath72 providing for the low dip in the allowed heavy @xmath40 mass .",
    "the dotted line represents the restriction from the d0 search for a heavy @xmath40 boson @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 can be accommodated to within @xmath73 here .",
    "first we consider nlc type lepton colliders . in the process",
    "@xmath74 there can be significant differences between the topflavor and sm predictions for the cross section due to the exchange of the heavy @xmath30 boson as well as to the deviation of the couplings from their sm values .",
    "in fact , the coupling of the electron and muon to @xmath28 goes as @xmath75 to zeroth order in the @xmath76 s , so we expect the cross section to increase significantly as @xmath34 increases",
    ". consider the case 1 scenario ( the results are very similar for all cases ) . for @xmath77 tev , and a heavy z mass of 850 gev , the cross section increases from close to the sm value at 3.8 pb to almost twice that value at 6.6 pb for @xmath78 .",
    "thus the heavy z boson will either be detected through this process or the parameter space will be restricted further .    at the lhc",
    "there is the potential for single top production through the production of a heavy @xmath40 boson and its subsequent decay to a top and bottom quark .",
    "this decay process has a distinctive signature of 2 b - jets plus a single large @xmath79 charged lepton .",
    "the decay cross section is about 1 nb for a heavy @xmath40 mass of 1 tev which is about the same as the cross section for top pair production through normal sm processes .",
