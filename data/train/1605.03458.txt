    "we know that the black hole entropy is proportional to the horizon aria @xmath0 , known as entropy - area law of the black hole @xcite . on the other hand , thermal fluctuations will happen for any thermodynamical system like black holes .",
    "specially , thermal fluctuations are more important for the small objects , because one can see that thermal fluctuations arise due to quantum fluctuations in the geometry of space - time .",
    "so , one can neglect such fluctuations for the large black holes .",
    "however , when the size of black hole decreased due to hawking radiation , the effect of quantum fluctuations on the geometry of the black holes will be important .",
    "thermal fluctuations modify thermodynamic of system and they appear in the black hole entropy as logarithmic term , so logarithmic corrected entropy may be written as @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant usually fixed as unity .",
    "we can track effect of thermal fluctuations using @xmath2 and obtain ordinary thermodynamics by setting @xmath3 .",
    "recently effect of thermal fluctuations considered for several kinds of black objects like charged ads black hole @xcite , black saturn @xcite and modified hayward black hole @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the ref .",
    "@xcite black hole entropy corrections due to thermal fluctuations in the black hole extensive parameters for various ads black holes have been studied for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "some asymptotic ads black holes like btz , d=4 kn - ads and r - charged black holes in various dimensions considered in that paper and found an universality in the logarithmic corrections to charged ads black holes entropy in various dimensions , which are expressed in terms of the black hole response coefficients via fluctuation moments .",
    "+ in this paper , we would like to consider an interesting kind of black hole which is called dyonic charged ads black hole in four dimensions which has both electric and magnetic charges @xcite . in the ref .",
    "@xcite using critical point investigation it is found that charged ads black holes are corresponding to van der waals fluid .",
    "also , it has been argued that dyonic charged ads black hole may be holographic dual of van der waals fluid with chemical potential @xcite .",
    "it is also found that van der waals fluid is holographic dual of rn ads black hole @xcite .",
    "so , by using holographic principles one can study dyonic charged ads black hole via a van der waals .",
    "we use this motivation to study logarithmic corrected thermodynamics of dyonic charged ads black hole to see such quantum gravity effect .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give brief review of dyonic charged ads black hole and recall necessary relations which need to study its thermodynamics under thermal fluctuation effect . in section 3 we obtain several thermodynamics relations and see the effect of logarithmic correction . in section 4",
    "we use holographic picture which is a van der waals fluid and study about critical behavior . in section 5",
    "we discuss about stability of black hole , and finally in section 6 we give conclusion .",
    "dyonic charged ads black hole is solution of einstein - maxwell theory with negative cosmological constant in four dimensions which described by the following action @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 is the strength of electromagnetic field and @xmath7 is the curvature radius of ads space , also @xmath8 assumed .",
    "solving einstein equations yields to the following metric , @xmath9 where , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are electric charge , magnetic charge and mass of the black hole respectively .",

    ". we will discuss about them in the next section when study the logarithmic corrected thermodynamics of the solution discussed above .",
    "+ before end of this section it is useful to note that 4 dimensional dyonic charged ads black hole in asymptotically ads space - time is conjectured to be dual to a 3 dimensional cft living on the boundary of the ads space @xcite .",
    "the bulk gauge field is dual to a global @xmath22 current operator @xmath23 , while conserved global charge of cft side given by , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is four dimensional newtonian constant related to degree of the gauge group @xmath26 of the cft using the holographic dictionary , @xmath27 where @xmath28 related to the strength of the magnetic field @xmath29 .",
    "we know that a black hole may be considered as thermodynamic systems characterized by a hawking temperature @xmath30 and the corresponding logarithmic corrected entropy @xmath31 given by the equation ( [ s1 ] ) , with @xmath32 , hence we have , @xmath33 where @xmath34 where we used the equation ( [ s7 ] ) in the last equality .",

    "also , the first term of r.h.s of the equation ( [ s10 ] ) is corresponding to ordinary ads black hole with thermodynamics pressure related to the cosmological constant @xcite , @xmath37 and thermodynamic volume , @xmath38 hence , in presence of electric and magnetic charge and thermal fluctuations , at least on of the above equations should be modified including charge and @xmath2 dependent terms .",
    "we will assume thermodynamic volume given by the equation ( [ s13 ] ) and obtain modified pressure .",

    "solid ( red ) and dashed ( yellow ) lines represent logarithmic corrected cases ( charged and uncharged respectively ) where helmholtz function goes to negative infinity at @xmath52 limit , while for the case of @xmath3 we have @xmath53 ( charged ) and @xmath54 ( zero - charge ) at @xmath52 limit .",
    "the solid red line may be corresponding to the black hole with mass @xmath46 where @xmath55 near the outer horizon ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 near the inner horizon ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "outside of the black hole , free energy is negative for the mentioned black hole mass .",
    "we can see critical radius @xmath58 , before it internal energy vanishes ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) and helmholtz energy have different behavior .",
    "as we will see later it relate to stability of black hole , ie .",
    "black hole is stable for @xmath59 .",
    "it means that the logarithmic effect is more important for small black hole .",
    "+ in order to obtain internal energy we used well - known thermodynamics relation , @xmath60 effect of thermal fluctuation on the internal energy is decreasing its value for the large black holes . on the other hand for",

    "+ then , we can calculate enthalpy using the equations ( [ s13 ] ) , ( [ s14 ] ) , ( [ s16 ] ) and the following relation , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is contribution of thermal fluctuations .",
    "enthalpy of the black hole may be considered as black hole mass @xcite , from the left plot of the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we can see as the @xmath3 limit ( dotted line ) enthalpy behaves as black hole mass which illustrated by the fig . [ fig1 ] ( a ) .",

    "is some negative enthalpy ( negative mass ) which is forbidden .",
    "hence , as before , there is a minimum value for the horizon radius of the black hole .",
    "there is a critical value for the horizon radius @xmath70 , effect of thermal fluctuations is decreasing @xmath71 for @xmath72 and is increasing @xmath71 for @xmath73 .",

    "after a bit calculation we find that the following condition @xmath78 is necessary to have valid first law of black hole thermodynamics .",

    "we find that value of charge is many important to have dual van der waals fluid .",
    "therefore , thermodynamics quantities obtained in the previous section use to see thermal fluctuation and hence quantum gravity effects . + we will discuss about critical points ( corresponding to black lines ( dash dot ) of both fig .",

    "however we expect that effect of thermal fluctuations change charge interval .",

    "fortunately , it is possible to see thermal fluctuation effects for @xmath96 where black hole is stable and we have van der waals fluid .",
