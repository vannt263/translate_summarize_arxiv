    "understanding the origin of ferromagnetism was one of the success stories of applying quantum mechanics to solid - state systems .",
    "classically , magnetic moments interact via the dipole - dipole interaction , which is much too weak to explain magnetic order at as high a temperature as is observed in , e.g. , iron or nickel.@xcite the explanation of this conundrum was found to be the exchange interaction mechanism , which leads to a spin - spin interaction that is governed by the coulomb interaction via the pauli principle .",
    "this was first understood in the context of atomic and molecular physics in the 1920s , and applied to solid - state physics in the 1950s.@xcite somewhat ironically , a straightforward application of the exchange interaction concept leads to a spin - spin interaction that is too strong , as the relevant energy scale is the atomic scale , or roughly @xmath0 .",
    "many - body and band - structure effects renormalize this scale and bring it down to the observed ferromagnetic scale of rougly @xmath1 or lower.@xcite this is still much larger than the dipole - dipole scale , and the latter is often neglected in the discussion of ferromagnets .",
    "when it is considered , e.g. , for its influence on the critical behavior,@xcite it is usually added phenomenologically to models that describe the exchange interaction .",
    "another spin - spin interaction that has been of interest lately is the dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction.@xcite it results ( in systems with suitable lattice structures ) from the spin - orbit interaction , has been derived from microscopic models , and is believed to be responsible for the helical magnetic order observed in mnsi and fege.@xcite rough estimates show that the dm interaction and the dipole - dipole interaction are of about the same strength , and should thus be considered together.@xcite furthermore , in weak ferromagnets , which order only at low temperatures , all three interactions can be comparable in strength , which can make the dipole - dipole and dm interactions crucial .    in this paper we provide a comprehensive derivation of all of these effects within one unified framework , namely , a field - theoretic description of electrons and photons . starting with finite - temperature quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) coupled to a field - theoretic description of finite - density quasi - relativistic electrons we show that the exchange , dipole - dipole , and dm interactions all appear naturally upon integrating out the photons .",
    "the exchange and dm interactions arise from integrating out the scalar part of the electromagnetic potential ; the dipole - dipole interaction , from integrating out the vector potential .",
    "furthermore , the dm and dipole - dipole interactions are indeed of the same order in the relativistic corrections to the schrdinger equation ( i.e. , of second order in @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the fermi velocity and @xmath4 the speed of light , or of second order in the fine structure constant @xmath5 ) .    integrating out the fermions then leads to an effective theory for quantum magnets that generalizes and replaces the hertz - millis theory@xcite and its generalizations.@xcite more generally , the theory provides a derivation of spin - spin interactions in itinerant fermi systems in general , whether or not they are in a parameter regime where they develop long - range magnetic order .",

    "the reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that the bare theory is renormalized in quantitatively substantial ways , and the corresponding energy and length scales in the properly renormalized theory are consistent with experimental observations.@xcite    equations ( [ eq:3.5 ] ) and ( [ eqs:3.17 ] ) show that the dipole - dipole and dm interactions , within the framework of the bare theory , are weaker than the exchange interaction by a factor of @xmath129 , or about @xmath134.@xcite relative to the bare exchange interaction , this implies an energy scale on the order of @xmath135 , which is comparable with the ordering temperature in mnsi . on the other hand , the length scale associated with the dm interaction ( i.e.",

    "these observations indicate that there are strong renormalizations , due to band - structure and many - body effects , of all terms in the bare action , and that different terms are renormalized in different ways in different materials .",
    "while this makes it hard to make general statements , the bare theory suggests that the dm interactions and the dipole - dipole interaction are generically comparable in strength , and in mnsi , for instance , both are expected to be a substantial fraction of the ( greatly reduced by renormalizations ) exchange interaction .",
    "we thus conclude that there is no a priori reason to neglect the dipole - dipole interaction in any system where the dm interaction is known to be important .",
    "this calls for a re - evaluation of a number of interesting problems , some of which we list in the following subsection .",

    "this seems especially relevant for mnsi where the phase transition is at low temperatures , i.e. , it is a weak helimagnet .",
