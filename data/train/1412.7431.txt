    "the base has a normal tunnel junction ( nis ) , whereas in the superconducting version this is replaced by a josephson junction .",
    "capacitances of the junctions are shown explicitly .",
    "we assume current bias at the base and voltage bias at the collector .",
    "( b ) : the central charge - tunneling processes in the original bot .",
    "the current from the collector drives the quasicharge as @xmath0 . in a bragg reflection ( blue arrows )",
    "a cooper - pair gets resonantly transferred from the emitter to the island while the system passes a resonance point @xmath1 , whereas in a zener tunneling ( black arrow ) the charge is accumulated on the island ( capacitors ) and increases its voltage until it reaches @xmath2 . ideally , this static situation can be escaped only by a quasiparticle tunneling to the base ( red arrow ) , providing base - current amplification when followed by repeated bragg reflections . ]    in this article , we study experimentally and theoretically a bloch - oscillating transistor that is based only on cooper - pair tunneling . a continuous current flow to the superconducting island is established by voltage biasing a high - resistance thin - film resistor in the immediate vicinity of the transistor island .",
    "this drives the quasimomentum of the system , corresponding to charge flow between the island and the collector .",

    "points the system can be made to switch between largely differing transport regimes by a small change in the base current . at high tunnel couplings",
    "the transport is found to bifurcate , so that the behavior becomes hysteretic at the two operation points .    for a detailed understanding of the underlying physics",
    ", we establish a density - matrix description of energy - band dynamics induced by three factors : 1 ) the collector bias , 2 ) cooper - pair tunneling , and 3 ) fluctuations and dissipation due to resistive parts of the bias circuitry .",
    "we find that at one side of an operation point , there exists a fragile balance between two base jj cooper - pair tunneling processes , occurring repeatedly to two opposite directions .",
    "a small change in the bias can lead to a situation where these counteracting processes do not anymore neutralize each other , and the system is forced to switch to a regime with lower transport and no counterflow .",
    "a shifted balance can be used for strong amplification of the base current , which in this case is formed from cooper pairs in contrast to single electrons in the traditional bot structure .",
    "we present the results of this work in the following way . in section  [ sec : bot ] , we discuss in a simplified way how the traditional working principle of bot changes when the bot is made fully superconducting . in section  [ sec : experiment ] we go through the experimental details , and in section  [ sec : theory ] we introduce our theoretical model that accounts for the most important energy - band dynamics in the system . in section  [ sec : results ] we compare the experiments with numerical simulations and discuss in detail the physics behind the observed phenomena .",
    "conclusions and outlook are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the original working principle of the bloch - oscillating transistor is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bot ] . the voltage applied on the collector attracts charge carriers from the island to flow through the resistor @xmath3 to the collector .",
    "this in turn leads to a motion of the quasicharge @xmath4 , that plays the role of the quasimomentum here .",
    "the large collector resistance @xmath5 guarantees small quantum fluctuations of the quasicharge  @xcite , and the system description in terms of energy - bands @xmath6 with semiclassical @xmath4 is possible . a charging energy that is comparable to the josephson coupling , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 the capacitance of the island , provides small band gaps between higher energy bands , also an essential property in the following .",
    "analogously to electronic states in solid , in the neighbourhood of avoided level crossings the system can either perform a bragg reflection , i.e.  stay on the same band , or zener tunnel to the higher energy band . here , this corresponds to a tunneling of single cooper - pair to the island , or absence of it , respectively  @xcite .",
    "repeated bragg reflections , called bloch oscillations , allow charge to flow between the emitter and the collector , until at some point a zener tunneling occurs and the potential of the island starts to increase .",
    "if further tunnelings are also inhibited , due to small gaps in higher bands , charge flow through the collector resistor stops only after the island voltage @xmath10 reaches the collector voltage .",
    "if one neglects incoherent cooper - pair tunneling through the emitter , the system can be made to switch back to the lowest energy band only by letting the electrons to tunnel to the base lead through the nis junction .",
    "therefore , if properly biased , single - electron tunneling events to the base can lead to multiple cooper - pair tunnelings across the emitter , and therefore to current amplification .",
    "this is the original working principle of the bloch - oscillating transistor , discussed more extensively in refs .  .",
    ", this provides higher collector current as for transport in the absence of the base .",
    "( b ) : in the neighbourhood of the second operation point , two counterflowing components ( bloch oscillations in the lowest band and `` counter - dropping '' of the quasicharge to the lowest band ) hold the voltages of the electrodes in favourable values for intensive resonant cooper - pair across the emitter ( upward transition ) .",
    "a small change in the base current can outbalance the situation and lead to only weak off - resonant cooper pair transport . ]      when the base lead is made superconducting , one could expect a similar transport scheme as in the original bot , but with cooper - pairs tunneling to the base .",
    "we find this to be qualitatively true , the base current can be amplified through repeated bloch - oscillations , but through a more subtle tunneling procedure .",
    "the difference stems from that , unlike in the case of quasiparticles , the cooper - pair tunneling occurs predominantly resonantly , which means preference for a certain voltage - difference window . here",
    ", we observe two new amplifications schemes based on resonant cooper - pair tunneling across both jjs .",
    "below we summarize the results in a simplified manner , and later in section  [ sec : results ] give a more quantitative analysis based on our numerical simulations .      in the amplification scheme based on a large josephson energy at the base jj , @xmath12 , the current brought to the base",
    "is used to trap the phase ( time - integrated voltage ) between the base and the emitter .",
    "when trapped nearby @xmath13 , the cooper - pair coming from the emitter can resonantly cotunnel to the base , and from there resonantly tunnel to the island . from the island it flows to the collector , as visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : processes](a ) . in the trapped state ,",
    "the two tunneling processes across the base - junction occur in opposite directions . at the limit where the two counterflowing current components can barely balance each other ( tunable by @xmath2 ) , a small change in the base current",
    "can overcome the maximal cotunneling transport between the emitter end the base , and the base voltage @xmath14 is forced to move closer to the collector voltage in order to balance the incoming and outgoing current components .",
    "this leads to modified operation in which cooper pairs from the emitter get predominantly transported directly to the island , but with a smaller frequency than in the state with @xmath15 , due to coulomb blockade of cooper - pair tunneling .",
    "such amplification is analogous to a classical current biased josephson junction , where the phase difference ( between the base and the emitter ) can be switched to a running state with a small change in the feed current  @xcite .      in this article ,",
    "the resonant cooper - pair tunneling across the base jj is described as an avoided energy - level crossing , and the resonant tunneling across the emitter jj as a vertical energy - level transition . in an emitter tunneling event ,",
    "the voltage of the island decreases , and subsequently starts to be recharged through the collector current .",
    "the momentarily lowered island voltage in turn induces resonant base tunneling . in fig .",
    "[ fig : processes](b ) , this means that after an upward transition ( blue arrow ) , while sliding downwards in the excited energy - band ( recharging , black arrow ) , a cooper pair can jump resonantly across the base jj in the neighbourhood of @xmath17 ( turquoise arrow ) .",
    "since the net transport to the base is fixed , this `` counterflow '' decreases @xmath14 .",
    "after the quasicharge has returned to the lowest energy - band , the change in @xmath14 pushes the quasicharge rightwards and induces an opposite - direction base tunneling , i.e.  a bragg reflection ( red arrow ) . in a steady state",
    ", the base voltage settles into a position where these two processes compensate each other , usually slightly below @xmath2 .    increasing the bias @xmath2 , and coming closer to @xmath18 , the rate of these to counteracting processes increases , as the resonance position of the upward transition starts to `` hit '' the propable position of the quasicharge ( that is in the neighbourhood of the bottom of the lowest energy band ) .",
    "when further increasing @xmath2 , the base voltage is trapped to @xmath18 , favourable for intensive upward transitions as well as increased bragg reflections . for certain @xmath2 , the probability for the ( strongly driven ) quasicharge to be in a region of resonant upward transition , starts to decrease .",
    "this in turn decreases bloch oscillations , and the trapping of @xmath14 starts to change to a rapid release .",
    "the dynamics is nonlinear , and there is no guarantee that this process is continuous .",
    "indeed , a small change in @xmath2 ( or base current ) can lead to a rapid switch of @xmath14 closer to @xmath2 .",
    "this means off - resonance in cooper - pair transport across the emitter and reduction of charge transport to the collector .",

    "the step - structure is surprisingly similar for the two polarities , the major difference being a shift in the absolute values of the voltage and the current . ]",
    "the studied sample consists of a single sis - junction at the aluminium base , a double sis - junction in the dc - squid geometry at the emitter , and of a thin - film cromium resistor of 10  nm thickness at the collector , in a transistor - type structure connecting to a superconducting aluminium island .",
    "sample parameters are given in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the difference to earlier realizations of the bloch - oscillating transistor  @xcite is that there the system had an nis - junction at the base , while here we have an sis junction , with the josephson coupling energy , @xmath22 .",
    "measurements were done in a nanoway pdr50 dilution refrigerator at a base temperature of 60  mk .",
    "additionally , a current bias to the base lead was established using a dc voltage source through a 1  g@xmath23 resistor .",
    "the base lead , in the vicinity of the jj , provides a relatively stable voltage due to its large capacitance to ground .",

    "also @xmath34 supports squeezing of the charge fluctuations on the island .",

    "this is because , on one hand , the weaker @xmath19 has a trouble to overcome coulomb blockade of cooper - pair tunneling , and on the other hand , we have lost another channel for cooper - pair transport between the emitter and the collector . in the numerically solved steady - state density - matrix ,",
    "[ fig : dm2 ] , we see the step as the emergence of population in the second energy - band ( starting at @xmath106v ) , due to enhanced upward energy - band transitions , describing direct tunneling from the emitter on the island .",
    "this should be distinguised from zener transitions to higher energy - bands caused by fast motion of the quasicharge , as they would demand considerable higher collector voltage and",
    "thus would be possible only for the highest plotted values of @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainfigure ] .",
    "the numerically obtained critical value for the voltage between the emitter and the base , @xmath14 , is independent of @xmath19 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainfigure ] ( top right ) .",
    "this is because the switching occurs nearby a fast decrease ( or negativity ) in the differential conductance of charge transport between the base and the emitter at the ( `` supercurrent '' ) region @xmath15 ( not plotted ) . in the used perturbative treatment , similar to the @xmath69-theory  @xcite ,",
    "the form is independent of @xmath19 , and this is also physically the case as long as the cotunneling is limited by the emitter tunneling coupling , i.e.  when @xmath80 .",
    "noticeable is also that the first step occurs well below the quasiparticle tunneling threshold , in accordance with experiments , supporting our interpretation that only cooper - pair tunneling is involved , as opposed to the case of normal bot  @xcite .",
    "actually , the steps occur in the region of onset for multiparticle tunneling  @xcite , @xmath107 .",
    "however , according to our additional numerical simulations , this type of subgap tunneling has only a minor contribution to the observed phenomena .",
    "the second step appears for strong emitter tunneling couplings , in fig .",

    "resonant emitter cooper - pair tunneling ( upward transition ) occurs only nearby a definite value of quasicharge . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm2 ] it can be spotted as the leftwards moving light - blue region in the lowest energy band .",
    "simultaneously , the upward transitions lead also to a strong current component across the base jj , due to the backward - tunneling effect at @xmath17 ( see the light - blue arrows in fig .  [",
    "fig : dm2 ] and the discussion above ) .",
    "this increases the voltage difference @xmath109 until becomes compensated by bragg reflections in the lowest band .",
    "the upward transitions become more frequent when there are better changes for quasicharge to enter the resonance region ( and stay there for a longer time ) .    in a stable solution",
    ", an increment of @xmath2 leads to an increment of @xmath14 , as visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainfigure ] ( bottom ) . before the step ,",
    "increasing @xmath2 therefore moves the resonance position of upward transitions to a region with more quasicharge population , and increases the rate for the quasicharge probability to be pumped to the first excited band . in the excited band ,",
    "when sliding downwards , the quasicharge can avoid a transition to the lowest energy - band , and instead get pushed to the right of @xmath17 , due to high @xmath109 .",
    "this part of the distribution corresponds to island voltage equal to the collector voltage . to get here",
    ", the quasicharge has performed a bragg reflection in the first excited band , which corresponds to backward base tunneling . from this region ,",
    "the quasicharge can drop to the lowest energy - band , for example , through inelastic ( forward - directed ) cooper - pair tunneling across the emitter .",
    "such a route is visualized by the yellow lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm2 ] .    in the neighbourhood of resonant upward transition from the bottom of the lowest band , that is for @xmath110",
    ", we observe an opposite effect with increasing @xmath2 : the previously occured latching of @xmath14 changes to a rapid release , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mainfigure ] ( top right ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that the time spend by quasicharge in the resonance region decreases .",
    "due to nonlinear nature of the phenomena involved , there is no guarantee that this process is continuous , and for high enough @xmath19 the reduction occurs as a discontinuous jump .",
    "quantitatively , an instability occurs if the lowest - band bragg - reflection rate reduction via a small decrease @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , is smaller than the counterflow reduction as a side product of upwards transitions with the base voltage @xmath113 . here",
    "an increment of the base voltage leads to a current towards the base , fig .",
    "[ fig : mainfigure ] ( bottom ) .    in the neighbourhood of the second step",
    "there appears also a new cotunneling process , when the vertical transition hits the second ( avoided ) energy - level crossing .",
    "this describes a higher - order tunneling process , where not only a single cooper - pair tunnels across the emitter jj , but is accompanied by two cooper - pairs across the base jj  @xcite , opening direct resonant transport between the emitter and the base .",
    "however , according to our additional numerical simulations , where this effect is taken out by removing all effects originating in the second energy - band splitting , the new process does not explain the hysteresis , even though makes it stronger .",
    "finally , when the collector voltage is increased above the second step , the base voltage switches close to the collector voltage , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mainfigure ] ( top right ) . here",
    "the cooper - pair tunneling across the emitter ( from the bottom of the lowest band ) is inelastic .",
    "the transport between the emitter and the collector , as well as across the base junction , reduce considerable .",
    "practically all of the probability density lies in the lowest band , symmetrically around @xmath114 .",
    "weak temporal fluctuations are triggered by inelastic cooper - pair tunneling across the emitter jj .",
    "this can then trigger further repeated resonant emitter tunneling events , now in higher energy bands , before quasicharge returns to the lowest band .",
    "the bifurcation of the transport with increasing @xmath19 is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainfigure ] bottom .",
    "generally , the form of the base - voltage solution is very robust against variations in the base current , basically just shifting the voltage - curve to the corresponding direction , in agreement with the experiments , fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment1 ] . in a stable solution ,",
    "a small increase of the base voltage leads to positive base current ( towards to the island ) .",
    "after a critical value of @xmath19 , this is not anymore true at the operation points , and the system becomes hysteretic , having two different stable states for the same collector bias .",
    "the state is picked according to which direction the voltage @xmath2 is swept .    in simulations the critical value of @xmath19 , at which the bifurcation occurs ,",
    "is strongly related to fluctuations in the voltage between the emitter and the base . in theory",
    ", we would expect the base - emitter transport to be close to dissipationless supercurrent [ as for the cooper - pair ( or `` bloch '' ) transistor  @xcite ] , due to low resistivity in the emitter and base leads .",
    "this would lead to hysteresis that extends over the whole plotted voltage range , resembling the case in a typical underdamped classical josephson junction .",
    "a possible high impedance environment would remove the hysteresis , due to the absence of supercurrent that is replaced by incoherent cotunneling events across the two junctions  @xcite .",
    "however , we observe no coulomb blockade in transport between the emitter and the base , supporting the presence of a noisy low - impedance environment , which also works against the hysteresis . a relatively large broadening ( see section  [ sec : s - bot ] ) have to be used to fit the experimental observations .",
    "however , results from independent two - point measurements between the emitter and the base , where the collector is left floating , also imply similar broadening .",
    "this data is characterized by the absence of supercurrent peak ( negative differential conductance ) , until @xmath19 reaches a value that is close to the beginning of hysteresis in the fully superconducting bot .",
    "the source for the high noise is presumably the elevated temperature of the collector resistor caused by joule heating . indeed , the used broadening is similar to thermal voltage fluctuations on the island induced by the collector .",
    "this article presents a detailed study of charge transport in a fully superconducting bloch - oscillating transistor .",
    "we discovered new operation schemes , where cooper - pair tunneling across the base josephson junction is used to control quasicharge motion on the small superconducting island , and thereby charge transport between the emitter and the collector .",
    "this occurred through trapping and detrapping of the base voltage , provided by the control of a counter - acting cooper - pair transport across the base junction .",
    "we found that the observed effects have a strong dependence on the josephson coupling @xmath62 , which can be tuned ( in real - time ) by an externally applied magnetix field , allowing versatile control of the effect .    for applications ,",
    "the important figures of merit are the current gain , the equivalent current noise at the input , and the noise temperature . in our measurements ,",
    "current gain up to 22 was observed , which is comparable to results of bot devices with nis base junctions .",
    "the equivalent current noise above the 1/f corner frequency was found to be 3.5  fa/@xmath115 which is somewhat higher than in regular bots having 1  fa/@xmath115 [ ] .",
    "the reason for this is most likely the relatively small collector resistance @xmath3 [ ] . on the other hand , the small value of @xmath3 leads to reduced input impedance , which results in a noise temperature of 0.2  k for the superconducting bot .",
    "this noise temperature , in fact , wins over the results on many regular bots ( see , e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "indeed , the fully superconducting bot has potential for a very low current noise , due to freeze - out of quasiparticles and possibility for coherent charge transport . in principle ,",
    "charge transport across the josephson junction can be noiseless , but noise will be inevitable due to the dissipation needed to avoid hysteresis . besides increasing the collector resistance and lowering its temperature for reduction of noise arising from the collector , one can opt for an alternative device realization based on artificial low - noise high impedance environment , e.g. chain of josephson junctions  @xcite",
    ". a significant noise reduction of the superconducting bot device could be a key issue for breakthrough applications in metrology or in quantum information processing .",
