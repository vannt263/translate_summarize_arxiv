    "the advent of advanced ligo ( aligo  aasi et al . 2015 ) and advanced virgo ( adv  acernese et al .",
    "2015 ) heralds the dawn of a new age of discovery in which gravitational wave ( gw ) detections will supplement traditional electromagnetic ( em ) detections , such as those by _ swift _ ( gehrels et al .",
    "we refer to aligo / adv in combination as lvc .",
    "these gw observatories will begin operating soon at a fraction of design capability , and within a few years should be able to detect neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) mergers out to @xmath0450 mpc and black hole - neutron star ( bh - ns ) mergers out to @xmath0900 mpc ( aasi et al .",
    "these distances are referred to as the `` horizon '' for these events .",
    "it is important to distinguish between `` horizon '' and `` range '' .",
    "the `` inspiral range '' , the most commonly cited figure - of - merit as regards lvc sensitivity , is defined as the radius of a sphere whose volume equals the sensitivity volume within which a signal - to - noise @xmath4 detection is achieved for a @xmath5 ns - ns merger , averaged over all sky locations and binary inclinations .",
    "the antenna projection functions and associated averagings were discussed by finn & chernoff ( 1993 ) and finn ( 1996 ) .",
    "the inspiral range is not a hard upper limit , as face - on binary orbit mergers produce stronger signals ( dalal et al .",
    "2006 ; maggiore 2007 ; schutz 2011 ; nissanke et al .",
    "the maximum theoretical detection distance , the horizon , is 2.26 times the range ( finn & chernoff 1993 ; see also abadie et al .",
    "a simple calculation shows that in a general population with binaries of random inclinations and positions over the whole sky , the fraction of aligo detections one expects to pick up from beyond the nominal inspiral range is about half of the total ( nissanke et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ; singer 2015 ) .",
    "high signal - to - noise ( snr ) detections will permit important physical parameters to be measured that are not easily accessible through traditional means , for instance the masses and spins of the merger components and the luminosity distance @xmath6 to the merger .",
    "a joint em / gw detection would provide powerful constraints on the merger physics .",
    "various groups have begun to examine prospects for finding an em counterpart to a gw trigger ( nuttall & sutton 2010 ; hanna , mandel , & vousden 2014 ; ghosh & nelemans 2014 ; fan , messenger , & heng 2015 ) .",

    "we describe a galaxy catalog  the census of the local universe  and quantify its completeness out to distances relevant for aligo . in section 4",
    "we estimate galaxy totals concomitant with putative aligo error volumes for the next 5 yr , if one restricts attention to bright galaxies . in section 5",
    "we discuss potential em observations in the optical , x - ray , and radio which might follow gw detection , and in section 6 we sum up .",
    "astrophysical sources that are powerful in em detectors are always weak in gw if the underlying physical process is nearly spherically symmetric .",
    "supernovae are among the brightest em transients but might produce peak gw strain amplitudes of @xmath7 cm , where @xmath8 is the dimensionless strain and @xmath9 the distance to source , and so be observable in aligo only to a few kpc ( ott et al .",

    "the fact that lgrbs are mostly spherically or axially symmetric makes them less interesting than sgrbs vis a vis gw detections .",

    "they compute atomic structure models for a few representative ions in order to calculate the radiative transition rates for tens of millions of lines , and find that resulting @xmath42process opacities are orders of magnitude larger than that of ordinary ( e.g. , iron - rich ) supernova ejecta .",

    "in addition to the optical / near - ir kilonova emission , one also expects a characteristic signal in the radio ( nakar & piran 2011 ; hotokezaka & piran 2015 ) as the ejecta first interact internally and then externally with the ism .",
    "the latter interaction gives rise to a blast wave with concomitant enhancement of magnetic fields and electron acceleration , leading to synchrotron radiation and radio emission .",
    "three temporal components to the radio band have been considered and studied , ( i ) early - time anisotropic emission along the relativistic jet axis associated with the ultra - relativistic ejecta , ( ii ) mildly relativistic , quasi - isotropic emission accompanying cocoon - breakout , leading to potential radio flares for off - axis observers , and ( iii ) late - time sub - relativistic dynamical ejecta producing radio flares on time scales of years .",

    "since these three distances are based on the ns - ns inspiral ranges for 2015 , 2017 , and 2020 , an additional factor which must be included for the third year stems from the fact that the clu catalog ends at 200 mpc , namely the fact that about half the detections would be expected to arise from between the range and the horizon .",
    "therefore for the third year the completeness is @xmath020% .",
    "both figures 2 and 3 show some regions of `` overcompleteness '' below 100 mpc .",
    "this is probably due to local over - densities such as the virgo supercluster .",
    "our choice of @xmath114 is motivated by a trade - off between including enough galaxies so that we encompass a reasonable fraction of putative sgrb host galaxies ( e.g. , berger 2014 , see his figure 8) on the one hand , and not having incompleteness become too great an issue on the other hand . taking @xmath114 picks out about half of the sgrb host galaxies shown in berger ( 2014 ) , therefore the true efficiency factors for the three target years would be @xmath050% , @xmath040% , and @xmath010% , respectively .",
    "another caveat arises from the fact that by utilizing @xmath69band data we are implicitly taking @xmath69band luminosity as a proxy for the compact object merger rate .",
    "although this assumption is generally supported by sgrb observations ( berger 2014 ) , it may in fact not be a universally good proxy ( e.g. , de freitas pacheco et al .",

    "is incremented only if @xmath143 ( hanna et al . 2014 ) , i.e. , if the galaxy lies within a thick spherical shell with @xmath144 , where the ns - ns inspiral range @xmath145 , 120 , and 180 mpc , respectively .",
    "this has the effect of essentially doubling the galaxy counts derived by truncating the integration at the range @xmath50 , thereby mimicking the effect of the range - to - horizon mapping ( hanna et al .",
    "thus in this experiment we are implicitly assuming a localization near @xmath50 for each target year , and thus in some sense our galaxy count totals represent upper limits .",
    "figure 4 shows the results of this experiment . each point is the mean of the 1000 individual los values , and",
    "the error bar is the standard deviation .",
    "two main points are worth noting .",
    "the most obvious is simply that larger error boxes yield more galaxies .",
    "the second is that counts are added only out to roughly the range for a given year .",
    "the clu totals out to @xmath134 ( for a localization in each year near @xmath50 ) are @xmath146 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , respectively . as noted previously , the clu is @xmath0100% complete above @xmath101 at 60 mpc , @xmath080% complete at 120 mpc , and @xmath040% complete at 180 mpc .",
    "in addition , the ns - ns range - to - horizon mapping roughly doubles the totals for localizations near @xmath134 with a large radial uncertainty .    for consistency we may consider galaxy counts derived directly from the schechter function .",
    "the galaxy density above @xmath101 is @xmath147 mpc@xmath18 . if we then multiply this by a volume @xmath148 , where , for the three target years ( @xmath50 , @xmath149 ) @xmath64 ( 60 mpc , 500 deg@xmath116 ) , ( 120 mpc , 100 deg@xmath116 ) , and ( 180 mpc , 20 deg@xmath116 ) , respectively , we obtain @xmath150 , 41.3 , and 27.8 .",
    "the results given in figure 4 reveal the dramatic reduction in tiling requirements brought about by restricting a search methodology to the brighter galaxies .",
    "were one simply to tile the entire 2015 , 2017 , and 2020 putative error boxes @xmath151 , 100 , and 20 deg@xmath116 using an em detector with a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath152 deg@xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath0@xmath153 arcmin , the number of tilings required would be @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 , respectively .    concentrating on selected bright galaxies",
    "reduces the tiling effort considerably .",
    "the optimal size of a `` tile '' is dictated by observations of short grbs - in particular their locations within their host galaxies .",
    "fong , berger & fox ( 2010 ) use precise _ hst _ localizations to study the cumulative distribution of projected physical offsets for short grbs with sub - arcsecond positions and find them to lie within @xmath0100 kpc of their host galaxy centers . for a typical distance of interest in this study , 100 mpc",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath010@xmath18 radian or @xmath00.057 deg  a projected area on the sky of @xmath00.010 deg@xmath116 or @xmath037 arcmin@xmath116 .",
    "this can be covered by an em detector with a rectangular field - of - view ( fov ) of at least @xmath157 arcmin or 49 arcmin@xmath116 . for such detectors the number of tilings will reduce to the number of galaxies as shown in figure 4 , i.e. , @xmath020 , @xmath020 , and @xmath010 , respectively .",
    "this represents a reduction in requisite tilings by @xmath0@xmath158 orders of magnitude over a brute force methodology , i.e. , simply covering the entire gw error box .",
    "furthermore , the underlying strategy of focusing attention only on bright galaxies is strengthened by the observation that short grbs tend to lie in the larger , brighter galaxies ( in contrast to long grbs which lie preferentially in dwarf irregulars ) .",
    "fong et al .",
    "( 2010 ) compare the projected physical offset distribution between short and long grbs and find that , when normalized to the sizes of their host galaxies , the distributions are indistinguishable .",
    "however , the absolute length scales differ by a factor of @xmath05 ( see also fong & berger 2013 ) .",
    "berger ( 2014 , see his figure 8) plots all known sgrb host galaxy @xmath109 values ; they span a range @xmath159 .",
    "our adopted cut value in this study @xmath160 is roughly at the median of the observed distribution , therefore our bright galaxy strategy would pick up about half the sgrbs shown in berger s sample . therefore the total effective completeness would be reduced by another factor @xmath02 below that given in the previous section , which only considered completeness for @xmath161 . the trade - off against lowering our cut value",
    "so as to include a greater fraction of putative sgrb host galaxies , i.e. , using for example @xmath162 or @xmath163 , is two - fold : ( i ) the number of galaxies would increase rapidly and ( ii ) incompleteness would become a more severe issue .      within an area of several square degrees on the sky",
    "there are many more optical transients than in other wavelengths , and therefore more opportunities for false positives ( kulkarni & kasliwal 2009 ; drout et al .",
    "2014 ; tanaka et al . 2014 ; cowperthwaite & berger 2015 ; singer et al .",
    "most of this activity stems from variable sources within our own galaxy .",
    "if we restrict our attention to bright galaxies , false positives could still arise from powerful sources within the target galaxy such as supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "however , sne are rare and also have longer timescales than em counterparts to ns binary mergers . more generally , nissanke et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and kasliwal & nissanke ( 2014 ) show that false positives can be due to both foreground stars ( e.g. , flare stars and cataclysmic variables ) and background galaxies ( e.g. , supernovae and agn ) .",
    "chance associations of such transients with a host galaxy location would be problematic to exclude based solely on photometry , and would probably necessitate multiwavelength observations .",
    "an advantage with the optical ( and near - ir ) is that the emission of interest is due to the kilonova , which is quasi - isotropic , whereas x - ray emission , for instance , would be beamed .",
    "a variety of large optical telescopes that have been active in grb follow - up have large fovs which would make them amenable to gw+em tiling observations : gtc / osiris ( 10.4 m aperture  @xmath164 arcmin fov ) , keck / lris ( 10 m  @xmath165 arcmin ) , lbt / lbc ( 8.4 m  @xmath166 arcmin ) , and vlt / vimos ( 8.2 m  @xmath167 arcmin ) .",
    "these instruments could all cover the fong et al .",
    "( 2010 ) short grb projected area in one tile .",
    "the transient sky is less chaotic in x - rays than in the optical .",
    "therefore individual transients stand out more .",
    "however , for short grbs only the beamed events will be detected in x - rays , which reduces the detection chances by the reciprocal of the beaming factor @xmath168 of a short grb , which is highly uncertain , @xmath169 .",
    "the primary instrument of relevance for x - ray follow - up is the _",
    "swift_/xrt ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) , a focusing x - ray telescope with a 110 cm@xmath116 effective area , an 18 arcsec resolution ( one - half power diameter ) in the @xmath171 kev band , and a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath172 arcmin , or @xmath00.15 deg@xmath116 .",
    "thus one xrt tile would be @xmath1730.15 deg@xmath116 , or about ten times the minimum required to tile a putative short grb host galaxy .",
    "given an xrt exposure time of @xmath00.1 ks ( kanner et al .",
    "2012 ) and a comparable time to slew between tiles , a complete search of the three error boxes depicted in figure 4 would place modest demands on _ swift_. the bright galaxy strategy for gw - em follow - up described in this work results in a far less strenuous use of xrt resources than discussed for example in evans et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "explosive transients which eject ionized matter into a surrounding medium eventually produce radio waves via synchrotron radiation as the electrons interact with tangled magnetic fields in shocked regions .",
    "radio emission has been seen in grbs , supernova remnants , colliding winds in massive binaries , symbiotic stars , and cataclysmic variables . over long timescales",
    "the radio provides good calorimetry on the total energetics of the explosion due to its quasi - isotropic emission ( nakar & piran 2011 ; hotokezaka & piran 2015 ) .",
    "thus , as with the optical observations of kilonovae , the radio band also has an advantage over x - rays , which are beamed .",
    "the radio sky is also relatively quiet as regards fast transients , although this may be at least partly due to the lower sensitivity of transient radio surveys compared to optical or x - ray ones .",
    "( frail et al . 2012 ; mooley et al . 2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "radio facilities have done extensive follow - up work on grbs and would be relevant in radio tilings of gw error boxes insofar as having beam fwhms that would cover the expected region in an @xmath174 galaxy : e.g. , ami - la : 6 arcmin beam at 16 ghz and jvla : 9 arcmin beam in c band ( 4.5@xmath155 ghz ) .",
    "at least 4 short grbs have had radio afterglows detected , 051221a , 050724 , 130603b , and 140903 ( chandra & frail 2012 ; berger 2014 ) .",
    "they were all quite faint , @xmath0100 @xmath50jy , but they were also considerably beyond the range of current interest @xmath175 mpc or @xmath176 .",
    "in this work we have argued for a strategy in which only the brighter galaxies are considered in gw - em follow - ups .",
    "we show that the clu catalog is fairly complete for @xmath161 out to 200 mpc . by weighting the galaxy counts within projected sky areas with a simple model for the aligo radial localization , we find that only about @xmath177 ( for 2015 ) , @xmath2 ( for 2017 ) , or @xmath3 ( for 2020 ) galaxies need be considered , assuming error boxes of @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath117 deg@xmath116 , respectively .",
    "this results if one restricts attention to galaxies in the upper 50th percentile in integrated luminosity density .",
    "furthermore , there are numerous em detectors with the property that one tile ( i.e. , one fov ) would encompass the region of interest .",
    "these facilities  optical , x - ray , and radio detectors  have carried out grb follow - up previously and could participate in future tiling observations .",
    "having one tile per galaxy reduces the number of requisite tiles down to the number of galaxies , a reduction in tiling effort by @xmath0@xmath158 orders of magnitude .",
    "the clu efficiencies for @xmath161 vary from @xmath0100% at ns - ns inspiral range @xmath180 mpc to @xmath040% at @xmath181 mpc . for our third target year , 2020",
    ", the efficiency is cut an additional factor of two due to the fact that @xmath0half of the detections at any given time come from beyond the range , and the clu is truncated beyond 200 mpc .",
    "in addition to the clu incompleteness , our adopted cut @xmath114 lies at roughly the median in the observed sgrb host galaxy @xmath182 distribution ( berger 2014 ) , therefore we lose another factor of two in potential sgrb hosts . lowering our @xmath183 value",
    "further would allow us to cover more of the expected sgrb host galaxy @xmath182 distribution but would exacerbate the clu incompleteness issue .",
    "an additional caveat arises from the hostless sgrbs with optical afterglows , and the ( majority ) of sgrbs for which no afterglows have been observed .",
    "if these lie further from the host galaxy centers than the @xmath0100 kpc maximal offset indicated by fong & berger ( 2013 ) , then our strategy could miss the kilonova emission .",
