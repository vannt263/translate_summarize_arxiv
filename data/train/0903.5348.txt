    "multi - loop scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric gauge and gravity theories have received considerable attention in recent years for their roles  @xcite in helping to confirm and utilize maldacena s ads / cft correspondence  @xcite and in probing the ultraviolet structure of supergravity theories  @xcite .",
    "in particular , multi - loop calculations offer important insight into the possibility that planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills scattering amplitudes can be resummed to _ all _ loop orders  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a loop iterative structure was suggested , leading to the detailed bds conjecture  @xcite for planar maximally - helicity - violating ( mhv ) amplitudes to all loop orders .",
    "alday and maldacena realized that certain planar scattering amplitudes at strong coupling may be evaluated as the regularized area of minimal surfaces in ads@xmath1s@xmath2 with special boundary conditions , and for four - point amplitudes they confirmed the bds prediction .",
    "direct evidence suggests that the all - order resummation holds as well for five - point amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the four- and five - point planar amplitudes is now understood as a consequence  @xcite of a new symmetry dubbed `` dual conformal invariance ''  @xcite , with further generalizations at tree level  @xcite and at infinite t  hooft coupling  @xcite . however , beyond five points , the bds conjecture requires modification  @xcite .",
    "high - loop calculations in @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory should also play a useful role in clarifying the structure of subleading color contributions to the soft anomalous dimension matrix of gauge theories  @xcite , once the evaluation of the required nonplanar integrals becomes feasible at three loops and beyond .    in a parallel development ,",
    "studies of multi - loop amplitudes in @xmath3 supergravity  @xcite have suggested that this theory may be ultraviolet finite in four dimensions  @xcite , challenging the conventional understanding of the ultraviolet properties of gravity theories . for a class of terms accessible by isolating one - loop subamplitudes via generalized unitarity  @xcite",
    ", the one - loop `` no - triangle '' property ( @xcite ) shows that at least a subset of these cancellations persist to all loop orders  @xcite .",
    "the direct calculation of the three - loop four - point amplitude of @xmath3 supergravity exposes cancellations beyond those needed for ultraviolet finiteness in @xmath4 in all terms contributing to the amplitude  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xmath5 theory and string theory have also been used to argue either for the finiteness of @xmath3 supergravity  @xcite , or that divergences are delayed through at least nine loops  @xcite , though issues with decoupling towers of massive states  @xcite may alter these conclusions .",
    "a recent direct field theory study proposes that a divergence may first appear at the five loop order in @xmath4 , though this can be softer if additional unaccounted symmetries are present  @xcite .",
    "if a perturbatively ultraviolet - finite point - like theory of quantum gravity could be constructed , the underlying mechanism responsible for the required cancellations is expected to have a fundamental impact on our understanding of gravity .",
    "the recent studies of multi - loop amplitudes rely on the modern unitarity method  @xcite as well as various refinements  @xcite . in this approach multi - loop amplitudes",
    "are constructed directly from on - shell tree amplitudes .",
    "this formalism takes advantage of the fact that tree - level amplitudes are much simpler than individual feynman diagrams , as well as makes use of various properties that hold only on shell .",
    "in particular , it provides a means of using an on - shell superspace  which is much simpler than its off - shell cousins  in the construction of loops amplitudes .",
    "summing over the physical states of propagating fields is one essential ingredient in higher - loop calculations .",
    "in particular , the modern unitarity method uses these sums over physical on - shell states in the reconstruction of any loop amplitude in terms of covariant integrals with internal off - shell lines .",
    "in supersymmetric theories the on - shell states can be organized in supermultiplets dictated by the supersymmetry .",
    "systematic approaches to evaluate such supersymmetric sums  or supersums  have recently been discussed in refs .",
    "as the calculations reach to ever higher loop orders these sums become more intricate .",
    "it is therefore helpful to expose their structure and simplify their evaluation as much as possible . in this paper",
    "we describe algebraic and diagrammatic methods which are helpful in this direction .",
    "these methods are the ones used in the course of computing and confirming the four - loop four - point amplitude of maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory , including nonplanar contributions .",
    "the main aspects of the construction of this amplitude , as well as the explicit results , will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "( the planar contributions are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    supersymmetric cancellations were extensively discussed at one and two loops in refs .",
    "@xcite using a component formalism that exploits supersymmetry ward identities  @xcite .",
    "these supersums were relatively simple , making it straightforward to sum over the contributions from the supermultiplet in components .",
    "the recent calculations of more complicated amplitudes in refs .",
    "@xcite , are performed in ways obscuring the systematics of the supersums .",
    "for example , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to avoid evaluating ( sometimes complicated ) supersums in maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory via the method of maximal cuts , where kinematics can be chosen to restrict scalars and fermions to a small ( even zero ) number of loops .",
    "remarkably , this trick is sufficient to construct anstze for @xmath0 super - yang - mills amplitudes .",
    "however , any such ansatz needs to be confirmed by more direct evaluations incorporating all particles in the supermultiplet , to ensure that no terms are dropped .",
    "it is therefore necessary to compare the cuts of the ansatz with the cuts of the amplitude for more general kinematic configurations , allowing all states to cross the cuts .",
    "the calculation of supersums is a crucial ingredient in carrying out this comparison .",
    "moreover , formal studies of the ultraviolet behavior of multi - loop amplitudes of supersymmetric theories , in particular of @xmath3 supergravity , are substantially aided by a formalism that exposes the supersymmetric cancellations .",
    "nair s original construction of an on - shell superspace  @xcite captured only mhv tree amplitudes in @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory ; more recent developments extend this to any helicity and particle configuration .",
    "the approach of  @xcite makes use of the mhv vertex expansion  @xcite to extend this on - shell superspace to general amplitudes .",
    "another strategy , discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , makes use of the britto , cachazo , feng , and witten ( bcfw ) on - shell recursion  @xcite to extend the mhv on - shell superspace to general helicity configurations .",
    "a new key ingredient of this approach is a shift involving anti - commuting parameters which may be thought of as the supersymmetric extension of the bcfw shift of space - time momenta .",
    "a recent paper uses shifts of anti - commuting parameters to construct a new super - mhv expansion  @xcite , which we do not use here . with the unitarity method  @xcite",
    ", superspace expressions for tree amplitudes can be extended to loop level .",
    "one - loop constructions along these lines were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , while various examples of supersums in higher - loop cuts , including four - loop ones , have already been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mhv vertex expansion suggests an inductive structure for supersymmetric cancellations .",
    "once these cancellations are exposed and understood for cuts with only mhv or tree amplitudes , more general cuts with non - mhv amplitudes follow rather simply  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the prescription for evaluating these more general cuts involves summing over mhv contributions with shifts of certain on - shell intermediate momenta .    to evaluate the supersymmetric sums that appear in unitarity cuts we introduce complementary algebraic and diagrammatic approaches .",
    "the algebraic approach has the advantage of exposing supersymmetric cancellations , in many cases leading to simple expressions .",
    "it is a natural approach for formal proofs . in particular",
    ", it allows us to systematically expose supersymmetric cancellations  within the context of the unitarity method ",
    "sufficient for exhibiting the well known  @xcite all - loop ultraviolet finiteness of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "the diagrammatic approach gives us a means of pictorially tracking contributions , allowing us to write down the answer directly by drawing a set of simple diagrams .",
    "it also leads to a simple algorithms for writing down the results for any cut by sweeping over all possible helicity labels .",
    "since it tracks contributions of individual states , it can be easily applied to a variety of cases with fewer supersymmetries . to illustrate these techniques we present various examples , including those relevant for evaluating the four - loop four - point amplitude of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "we will also show that these techniques are not restricted to four - point amplitudes by discussing some higher - point examples .",
    "one potential difficulty with any four - dimensional approach is that unitarity cuts are properly evaluated in @xmath6 dimensions  @xcite , since they rely on a form of dimensional regularization  @xcite related to dimensional reduction  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a frequent goal in multi - loop calculations is the determination of the critical dimension in which ultraviolet divergences first appear .",
    "consequently , such calculations often need to be valid away from four dimensions .",
    "this requirement complicates the analysis significantly , because powerful four - dimensional helicity methods  @xcite can no longer be used .",
    "any ansatz for an amplitude obtained with intrinsically four - dimensional methods , such as the ones of the present paper , needs to be confirmed through @xmath6-dimensional calculation .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath4 analysis offers crucial guidance for the construction of @xmath6-dimensional amplitudes . additionally , @xmath4 methods appear to capture the complete result for four - point @xmath0 super - yang - mills amplitudes with fewer than five loops  @xcite .",
    "while difficulties appear to arise with extending the mhv diagram expansion to general @xmath3 supergravity tree amplitudes  @xcite , they will not concern us here .",
    "instead we rely on the kawai - lewellen - tye ( klt ) relations  @xcite , or their reorganization in terms of diagram - by - diagram relations  @xcite , to obtain the sums over supermultiplets in @xmath3 supergravity cuts directly from the cuts of corresponding @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory amplitudes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in we review on - shell",
    "superspace at tree level and introduce @xmath7 @xmath8-symmetry index diagrams . in we review the modern unitarity method and present the general structure of supercuts . in we",
    "explain how the supersums can be evaluated in terms of the determinant of the matrix of coefficients of a system of linear equations .",
    "this section also contains various examples of cuts of @xmath0 super - yang - mills , including those of a five - point amplitude at four loops . describes supersums in terms of @xmath8-symmetry index diagrams , providing pictorial means for tracking different contributions . as discussed in ,",
    "these diagrams allow us to relate the cuts of amplitudes with fewer supersymmetries to maximally supersymmetric ones .",
    "they also allow us construct a simple algorithm for obtaining all contributions to cuts from purely gluonic ones .",
    "various three and four - loop examples are presented in . in we outline the use of the klt relations to carry over the results for the sum over states in cuts of @xmath0 super - yang - mills amplitudes to the corresponding ones of @xmath3 supergravity theory .",
    "our conclusions are presented in .",
    "on - shell superspaces are useful tools for probing the properties of supersymmetric field theories , providing information on their structure without any complications due to unphysical degrees of freedom . here",
    "we review the construction of an on - shell superspace for @xmath0 super - yang - mills amplitudes . in its original form ,",
    "devised by nair  @xcite , it described maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) gluon amplitudes and their supersymmetric partners . while we will depart at times from nair s original construction , the main features will persist .",
    "this same superspace also captures general amplitudes .",
    "indeed , there currently exists two methods for constructing general amplitudes from mhv amplitudes : the mhv vertex construction of cachazo , svrek and witten  @xcite and the on - shell recursion relation of britto , cachazo , feng and witten ( bcfw )  @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of the former approach has been given in refs .",
    "@xcite , while that of the latter approach in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to evaluate the supersum in unitarity cuts we will use an approach based on mhv vertices , along the lines taken by bianchi , elvang , freedman and kiermaier  @xcite .",
    "we will find that supersums involving only mhv and/or tree amplitudes have a surprisingly simple structure .",
    "we will also show how the mhv vertex construction allows us to immediately carry over this simplicity , with only minor modifications , to more general cuts involving arbitrary non - mhv tree amplitudes .",
    "the on - shell superspace of the type we will review here generalizes easily to mhv and amplitudes in @xmath3 supergravity .",
    "difficulties however , appear with the mhv vertex construction of non - mhv gravity tree amplitudes because the on - shell recursions used to obtain the expansion  @xcite can fail to capture all contributions  @xcite .",
    "such amplitudes may nevertheless be found without difficulty through supersymmetric extensions  @xcite of the on - shell bcfw recursion relations  @xcite , which do carry over to @xmath3 supergravity .",
    "however , at present  @xcite we find it advantageous to use the klt tree - level relations  @xcite or the recently discovered diagram - by - diagram relations  @xcite , to obtain @xmath3 supergravity unitarity cuts directly from those of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "the vector multiplet of the @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra consists of one gluon , four gluinos and three complex scalars , all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , which here we take to be @xmath9 . with all states in the adjoint representation",

    "the sum runs over all noncyclic permutations of legs , which is equivalent to all permutations keeping one leg fixed ( here leg  @xmath16 ) .",
    "helicities and polarizations are suppressed .",
    "we use the all outgoing convention for the momenta to define the amplitudes .",
    "all states transform in antisymmetric tensor representations of the @xmath7 @xmath8-symmetry group such that states with opposite helicities are in conjugate representations .",
    "the @xmath8-symmetry and helicity quantum numbers uniquely specify all on - shell states : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the positive and negative helicity gluons and gluinos while @xmath20 are scalars .",
    "( the scalars are complex - valued and obey a self - duality condition which will not be relevant here . )",
    "these fields are completely antisymmetric in their displayed @xmath8-symmetry indices  denoted by @xmath21which transform in the fundamental representation of @xmath7 , giving a total of 16 states in the on - shell multiplet .",
    "alternatively , we can use the dual assignment obtained by lowering the indices with a properly normalized levi - civita symbol @xmath22 , giving the fields , @xmath23 we will use both representations to describe the amplitudes of @xmath0 super - yang - mills . for mhv amplitudes we will mainly use the states with upper indices in whereas for we will use mainly the states with lower indices in .",
    "this is a matter of convenience , and the two sets of states may be interchanged , as we will briefly discuss later in this section .",
    "we begin by discussing the mhv amplitudes , which we define as an amplitude with a total of eight ( 2 @xmath24 4 distinct ) upper @xmath7 indices .",
    "( in order to respect @xmath7 invariance , amplitudes of the fields in must always come with @xmath25 upper indices , where @xmath26 is an integer .",

    "some simple examples of mhv amplitudes , which we will use in , are , @xmath27 where @xmath21 are four distinct fundamental @xmath7 indices .",
    "the overall phases of these amplitudes depend on conventions",
    ". we will fix this ambiguity by demanding that the phases be consistent with the supersymmetry algebra , which is automatically enforced when using superspace .",
    "the amplitudes are written in terms of the familiar holomorphic and antiholomorphic spinor products , @xmath28 = \\bar{u}_+(p_i ) u_-(p_j ) = \\ve_{\\dot\\alpha\\dot\\beta } \\tlambda_i^{\\dot\\alpha } \\tlambda_j^{\\dot\\beta}\\ , , \\label{spinorproddef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath29 and @xmath30 are commuting spinors which may be identified with the positive and negative chirality solutions @xmath31 and @xmath32=u_{-}(p_i)$ ] of the massless dirac equation and the spinor indices are implicitly summed over .",

    "the proper contractions of momenta @xmath39 with spinorial objects will be implicitly assumed in the remainder of the paper .",
    "typically , we will denote external momenta by @xmath40 and loop momenta by @xmath41 .",
    "a subtlety we must deal with is a slight inconsistency in the standard spinor helicity formalism for massless particles when a state crosses a cut . in",
    "a given cut we will always have the situation that on one side of a cut line the momentum is outgoing , but on the other side it is incoming .",
    "thus across a cut we encounter expressions such as @xmath42@xmath43 , which is not properly defined in our all - outgoing conventions and can lead to incorrect phases .",
    "this is because the spinor @xmath42@xmath44 carries momentum @xmath45 , and thus it has an energy component of opposite sign to that carried by the spinor @xmath46 .",
    "this problem is due to the fact that the spinor helicity formalism does not distinguish between particle and antiparticle spinors , as has been discussed and corrected in refs .",
    "@xcite for the mhv vertex expansion , and for bcfw recursion relations with fermions . to deal with this",
    ", we use the analytic continuation rule that the change of of sign of the momentum is realized by the change in sign of the holomorphic spinor  @xcite , @xmath47 \\mapsto |i ] \\ , .",

    "each term in the superamplitude corresponds to a regular component scattering amplitude . depending upon the detailed formulation of the superspace , scattering amplitudes of gluons , fermions and scalars",
    "are then formally extracted either by the application of grassmann - valued derivatives @xcite , or , equivalently , by multiplying with the appropriate wave functions and integrating over all grassmann variables @xcite .",
    "effectively , these operations amount to selecting the component amplitude with the desired external states .",

    "we suppress the delta - function factor @xmath54 responsible for enforcing the overall momentum conservation .",
    "the eightfold grassmann delta function in ( [ mhvsuperamplitude ] ) is a product of pairs of delta functions , each pair being associated with one of the possible values of the @xmath7 @xmath8-symmetry index : @xmath55 this expression can be further expanded , @xmath56 using the usual property of grassmann delta functions that @xmath57 .",
    "each monomial in @xmath58 in the superamplitude corresponds to a different mhv amplitude . in this form",

    "this method and its various refinements have been described in some detail in references  @xcite , so here we will mainly review points salient to the sums over all intermediate states appearing in maximally supersymmetric theories .",
    "6.5 truein    the construction starts with an ansatz for the amplitude in terms of loop momentum integrals .",
    "we require that the numerator of each integral is a polynomial in the loop and external momenta subject to certain constraints , such as the maximum number of factors of loop momenta that can appear .",
    "the construction of such an ansatz is simplest for the @xmath0 super - yang - mills four - point amplitudes where it turns out that the ratio between the loop integrand and the tree amplitudes is a rational function solely of lorentz invariant scalar products  @xcite . for higher - point amplitudes",
    "similar ratios necessarily contain either spinor products or levi - civita tensors , as is visible even at one loop  @xcite .",
    "the arbitrary coefficients appearing in the ansatz are systematically constrained by comparing generalized cuts of the ansatz to cuts of the loop amplitude .",

    "when there is a four - point subamplitude , this can be advantageous  @xcite . in",
    ", we display a few unitarity cuts relevant to four loops . if cuts of the ansatz can not be made consistent with the cuts of the amplitude , then it is , of course , necessary to enlarge the ansatz .",
    "the reconstruction of an amplitude from a single cut configuration is typically ambiguous as the numerator may be freely modified by adding terms which vanish on the cut in question .",

    "we start from generalized cuts @xcite with the maximum number of cut propagators and then systematically reduce the number of cut propagators  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to isolate the missing pieces of the amplitude , as well as reduce the computational complexity of each cut .",
    "a related procedure is the `` leading - singularity '' technique , valid for maximally supersymmetric amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "these leading singularities , which include additional hidden singularities , have been suggested to determine any maximally supersymmetric amplitude  @xcite .    at one loop , all singular and finite terms in amplitudes of massless supersymmetric theories",

    "at present , @xmath6-dimensional evaluation of cuts is required to guarantee that integrand contributions which vanish in four dimensions are not dropped .",

    "for these we apply the mhv vertex expansion ( [ cswequation ] ) , which reduces these more complicated cases down to a sum of similar expressions as with only mhv and amplitudes ( and additional propagators ) .",
    "certain properties of the @xmath0 super - yang - mills cuts can be inferred from the structure of generalized cuts and the manifest @xmath8-symmetry and supersymmetry of tree - level superamplitudes .",
    "first we note that a cut contribution that corresponds to a product of only mhv tree amplitudes consists of a single term of the following numerator structure , _ i ( _ a=1 ^ 4^(2)(q^a_i ) ) = _ a=1 ^ 4 ( _ i^(2 ) ( q^a_i ) ) , [ productcommutation ] where we have made it explicit that the product over the @xmath7 indices can be commuted past both the product over internal cut legs @xmath64 and the product over tree amplitudes labeled by @xmath137 .",
    "here @xmath138 is the total supermomentum of superamplitude @xmath139 , where @xmath52 runs over all legs of @xmath139 . for convenience",
    "we have also suppressed the spinor index .",
    "from the right - hand - side of , we conclude that the numerator factor arising from the supersum of a cut contribution composed of only mhv amplitudes is simply the fourth power of the numerator factor arising from treating the index in @xmath140 as taking on only a single value .",
    "a cut contribution constructed from only mhv and @xmath141 tree amplitudes has similar structure , though the details are slightly different . using the fermionic fourier transform operator ( [ fourieroperation ] ) any @xmath12-point @xmath141 tree amplitude can manifestly be written as a product over four identical factors , each depending on only one value of the @xmath8-symmetry index , @xmath142\\ , \\delta^{(2)}\\bigl(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\tilde{\\lambda}_j\\etab^a_j\\bigr)\\,.\\ ] ] consequently , just as for cut contributions constructed solely from mhv tree amplitudes , for the cases where only mhv and tree amplitudes appear in a cut , the end result is that the fourth power of some combination of spinor products appears in the numerator",
    ". this feature will play an important role in , simplifying the index diagrams that track the @xmath8-symmetry indices .",
    "the super - mhv vertex expansion generalizes this structure to generic cuts of @xmath0 loop amplitudes .",
    "as already mentioned , any non - mhv tree superamplitude can be expanded as a sum of products of mhv superamplitudes .",
    "if we insert this expansion into a generalized cut , we obtain a sum of terms where the structure of each term is the same as a cut contribution composed purely of mhv amplitudes .",
    "all that changes is that the momenta carried by some spinors are shifted according to , and some internal propagators are made explicit .",
    "we immediately deduce that the numerator of each term is given by a fourth power of the numerator factor arising when treating the index of @xmath140 as having a single value .",
    "this general observation is consistent with results found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the structure of the constraints due to supersymmetry may be further disentangled .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the cut of any @xmath0 super - yang - mills multi - loop amplitude is proportional to the overall super - momentum conservation constraint on the external supermomenta .",
    "similar observations have been used in a related context in ref .",
    "this property is a consequence of supersymmetry being preserved by the sewing , which is indeed manifest on the cut , as we now show .",
    "consider an arbitrary generalized cut constructed entirely from tree - level amplitudes ; using the mhv - vertex super - rules , this cut may be further decomposed into a sum of products of mhv tree amplitudes .",
    "each term in this sum contains a product of factors of the type ( [ deltaform ] ) , one for each mhv amplitude in the product . using the identity @xmath143 each such product of delta functions",
    "may be reorganized by adding to the argument of one of them the arguments of all the other delta functions : _",
    "i=1^m^(8)(q_i^a)= ^(8)(_i=1^m q_i^a ) _",
    "i=2^m^(8)(q_i^a ) , [ extract_tree ] where @xmath26 is the number of mhv trees amplitudes  including those from a single graph of each mhv - vertex expansion . in the conventions ( [ signrules ] )",
    "in which a change of the sign of the four - momentum @xmath144 translates to a change of sign of the holomorphic spinor @xmath145 , and therefore also in @xmath146 , we immediately see that in the first delta function all @xmath147 corresponding to internal lines occurs pairwise with opposite sign , and thus cancel , leaving only external variables , ^(8 ) ( _ i=1^m q_i^a ) = ^(8 ) ( _ i_i ^a_i ) , [ overalldelta ] where @xmath148 denotes the set of external legs of the loop amplitude whose cut one is computing . thus , this delta function depends only on the external momentum configuration and is therefore common to all terms appearing in this cut .",
    "the generalized cuts involving only tree amplitudes are sufficient for reconstructing the complete loop amplitude  @xcite , therefore it is clear that the superamplitude and all of its cuts are proportional to @xmath149 , assuming four - dimensional kinematics .    as can be seen from , the discussion above , showing supermomentum conservation , goes through unchanged for cuts containing @xmath12-point tree - level @xmath150 amplitudes with @xmath151 .",
    "this includes all cuts with real momenta . for @xmath77 , from ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the supermomentum conservation constraint of three - point amplitudes may be obtained from their fermionic constraint upon multiplication by a spinor corresponding to one of the external lines . using this observation , it is then straightforward to show that for @xmath77 continue to hold .",
    "the explicit presence of the overall supermomentum conservation constraint is sufficient to exhibit the finiteness  @xcite of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "since , as we argued , the same overall delta function appears in _ all _ cuts , it follows that the complete amplitude also has it as an overall factor .",
    "in fact , there is a strong similarity between the superficial power counting that results from this and the super - feynman diagrams of an off - shell @xmath152 superspace .",
    "indeed , the count corresponds to what we would obtain from the feynman rules of a superspace form of the mhv lagrangian  @xcite which manifestly preserves half of the supersymmetries .",
    "more concretely , for any renormalizable gauge theory with no more than one power of loop momentum at each vertex , the superficial degree of divergence is , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the number of loops , @xmath6 the dimension , @xmath155 the number of external legs and @xmath156 the number of powers of momentum that can be algebraically extracted from the integrals as external momenta .",
    "for each power of numerator loop momentum that can be converted to an external momentum , the superficial degree is reduced by one unit .",
    "taking @xmath4 and @xmath157 , corresponding to the four powers of external momentum implicit in the overall delta function ( [ overalldelta ] ) , we see that @xmath158 for all loops and legs .",
    "this also implies that @xmath159 super - yang - mills amplitudes can not contain any subdivergences as all previous loop orders are finite .",
    "it then follows inductively that the negative superficial degree of divergence , for all loop amplitudes , is sufficient to demonstrate the cancellations needed for all order finiteness .",
    "we note that although this displays the finiteness of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory , not all cancellations are manifest , and there are additional ones reducing the degree of divergence beyond those needed for finiteness  @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for @xmath3 supergravity ; in this case the two - derivative coupling leads to a superficial degree of divergence which monotonically increases with the loop order . without additional mechanisms for taming its ultraviolet behavior ,",
    "this would lead to the conclusion of that the theory is ultraviolet divergent . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite direct evidence to all loop orders indeed points to the existence of much stronger ultraviolet cancellations .",
    "we now address the question of how to best carry out the evaluation of multiple fermionic integrals , which can become tedious for complicated multi - loop cuts .",
    "an approach to organizing this calculation , discussed in the following sections , is to devise effective diagrammatic rules for carrying out these integrals .",
    "another complementary approach , discussed in this section , relies on the observation that the fermionic delta functions may be interpreted as a system of linear equations determining the integration variables ( i.e. the variables @xmath58 corresponding to the cut lines ) in terms of the variables @xmath58 associated with the external lines of the amplitude . from this standpoint ,",
    "the integral over the internal @xmath58 s may be carried out by directly solving an appropriately chosen system of equations and evaluating the remaining supersymmetry constraints on the solutions of this system .",
    "while the relation between the fermionic integrals and the sum over intermediate states in the cuts is quite transparent , as we will see in later sections , it is rather obscure to identify the contribution of one particular particle configuration crossing the cut in the solution of the linear system .",
    "simple counting shows that after the overall supermomentum conservation constraint is extracted , the number of equations appearing in cuts of mhv amplitudes equals the number of integration variables . for such cuts the result of the grassmann integration",
    "is then just the determinant of the matrix of coefficients of that linear system .",
    "the same counting shows that the number of fermionic constraints appearing in cuts of n@xmath160mhv amplitudes is larger than the number of integration variables .",
    "one way to evaluate the integral is to determine the integration variables by solving some judiciously chosen subset of the supermomentum constraints and substitute the result into the remaining fermionic delta functions .",
    "care must be taken in selecting the constraints being solved , as an arbitrary choice may obscure the symmetries of the amplitude .",
    "one approach is to take the average over all possible subsets of constraints determining all internal fermionic variables .",
    "another general strategy is to select the fermionic constraints with as few external momenta as possible .",
    "since the integration variables are determined as ratio of determinants , all identities based on over - antisymmetrization of lorentz indices , such as schouten s identity , are accounted for automatically , generally yielding simple expressions .",
    "2.5 truein    to illustrate this approach let us consider the example , shown in , of the supercut of the one - loop @xmath12-point mhv superamplitude ^fig .",

    "5.1 truein    let us now illustrate the interplay between supersum calculations and the super - mhv vertex expansion .",

    "besides the contributions shown in there are additional contributions which sum to the complex conjugate of these , ignoring an overall four - point tree superamplitude factor .",

    "furthermore , we note that since @xmath206 is a grassmann even operator we can immediately carry out the integration of case ( c ) , @xmath207 however this has to be done with some care , as will be discussed in section , where a precise rule will be given .    interpreting the supermomenta of and momenta of as parts of @xmath7 index lines , gives us the pictorial rules displayed in for the transition condition of an index line across a cut . for an mhv - mhv transition the index line ends ( or starts ) at the cut , corresponding to the insertion of a supermomentum @xmath208 .",

    "as shown in the figure , the sum over the diagrams can be interpreted as a product over the four su(4 ) indices , depicted as a fourth power .",
    "this is consistent with the general result discussed in : summing over the states crossing a cut composed of a product of mhv and tree amplitudes is a sum of terms raised to the fourth power . in the diagrammatic language of index lines",
    "this also leads to the simplification which allows us to consider each of the four @xmath7 index - line factors independently .",
    "thus in the remaining part of this paper all index diagrams will be drawn for only a single @xmath7 index .",
    "interestingly , the index diagrams follow a `` sum over paths '' principle analogous to the one of quantum mechanics . in our one - loop example , a single continuous index line has two possible allowed paths , crossing the cut through either the upper or lower internal leg .",
    "thus , there are two terms for each index in the state sum or a total of @xmath111 for the four index lines . for cuts which factorize into adjacent mhv amplitudes or adjacent amplitudes ,",
    "the index lines are discontinuous , or the `` paths '' are broken into several pieces , as explained in the previous section .",
    "see the following sections for explicit examples of this .    more generally , for external gluon amplitudes the structure discussed in the above one - loop example is quite generic for any configuration of mhv and tree amplitudes appearing in a cut . with external gluons",
    "the four @xmath7 index lines all start on the same legs , allowing us to treat each of the lines identically .",
    "if some of the external particles are scalars or fermions then the @xmath7 index lines can start at different external legs , but in any case , each of the four @xmath7 index lines can be treated independently .",
    "as discussed in , if a non - mhv tree amplitude appears we simply insert its expansion in terms of mhv or amplitudes into the cut , effectively reducing the evaluation of the relevant supersums to the discussion above .      as explained in ,",
    "each index line drawn for an mhv tree amplitude ( in a cut ) corresponds to a factor @xmath212 , and for an tree amplitude it corresponds to a factor @xmath213 .",
    "since both @xmath214 and @xmath213 are grassmann even as well as symmetric under the exchange @xmath215 it may seem to be a straightforward task to convert the index diagrams to analytic expressions .",
    "however , in practice there are different strategies for converting the grassmann - valued numerators to spinor expressions , two of which we describe here .",
    "first we note that since the index diagrams have pre - selected the terms that survive in the supersum , the application of any supersum operator on an index diagram serves only to convert the product of @xmath58 s and @xmath59 s to a @xmath216 factor , which can be achieved by simple replacements rules .",
    "the two alternative replacement rules are :      one option , which will avoid the slightly more complicated mhv- transition operator @xmath217 , is to make use of the fourier transform and work only in @xmath58 superspace .",
    "( it also does not require the @xmath218 sign flip for incoming momenta given in . )",

    ", thus care has to be taken to not alter the position of @xmath213 relative to the position of , say , @xmath223 in the cut expression .",
    "after the fourier transform , every term in the cut will contain exactly the same product of @xmath58 s , albeit in different orderings .",

    "precise tracking of the matter fields through the cuts is dictated by the index - line diagrams .",
    "for a few theories which are closely related to @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory it is possible to write down closed form expressions for the cuts of their scattering amplitudes in terms of the @xmath0 cuts . this is a consequence of the fact that the @xmath90 vector multiplet decomposes in a direct sum of representations of @xmath272 supersymmetry algebras . by systematically dropping contributions following their @xmath8-charges ,",
    "we obtain cuts of amplitudes in theories with reduces supersymmetry and a field content which is a subset of that of @xmath0 sym .",
    "starting from the @xmath0 spectrum we may eliminate one @xmath273 hypermultiplet to obtain the spectrum of the pure @xmath273 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "this can be done by expressing the representations of the @xmath7 @xmath8-symmetry in representations of an @xmath274 subgroup and restricting to states transforming trivially under one @xmath275 factor . without loss of generality , this may be taken to act on indices 3 and 4 ; this truncation breaks @xmath7 down to @xmath275 , giving the following states : @xmath276 here @xmath277 or @xmath278 are the @xmath275 @xmath8-symmetry indices .",
    "although indices 3 and 4 no longer plays the role of group indices , we keep them as labels to distinguish the states and to keep notation uniform with the @xmath0 case . as expected , there are two fermions which , on - shell , correspond to four states @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "the two scalar fields are complex conjugates @xmath281 , thus the counting of on - shell states is consistent with the @xmath273 gauge multiplet .",
    "in terms of the index diagrams this truncation implies that we should keep only those diagrams where indices 3 and 4 are grouped together . for external gluons , this gives the following cut numerator , @xmath282 where @xmath283 represent the same terms as in , and the squares @xmath284 are a consequence of the above requirement that two indices are always grouped together in the diagrams .    in the same spirit , by dropping one chiral multiplet from the @xmath285 spectrum",
    "we obtain the on - shell @xmath286 gauge supermultiplet , @xmath287 by requiring that the fields transform trivially in the @xmath288 directions we remove all scalars and all but one fermion .",
    "although this also fixes the index @xmath289 we keep the label @xmath53 `` covariant '' as a reminder that it should treated differently from the others .",
    "this truncation is reflected at the level of index diagrams as three lines , corresponding to three indices taking the values @xmath288 , always being grouped together , while the remaining line being allowed to have an independent routing . for external gluons , the resulting cut numerator factor is then , @xmath290    by truncating away all fields carrying @xmath8-charges , the @xmath0 theory is reduced to pure ( @xmath291 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "the cut numerators may then be identified with those index diagrams in which all four index lines follow the same path .",
    "this eliminates all contributions from `` matter '' fields and yields the numerator , @xmath292 the above formul  for cut numerators can be summarized in a single closed form , @xmath293 which holds for @xmath294 , where the @xmath295 case is identical to the @xmath0 super - yang - mills case .",
    "this is in line with the well - known on - shell equivalence of the @xmath295 and @xmath90 super - yang - mills theories  @xcite . in equation ( [ gensupersum ] )",
    "the first factor represents the supersymmetric summation over index lines with @xmath296 independent @xmath8-symmetry indices , the second factor corresponds to the controlled truncation of index diagrams , so that @xmath297 indices are always grouped together .",

    "as a consistency check we have confirmed that the amplitudes grouped in the generating functions , for each value of @xmath296 , form a closed set under factorization , thus ensuring that internal states in these amplitudes are in the spectrum of external states . equipped with the generating functions",

    "this property is sufficient to link all mhv amplitudes in the generating function ( [ mhvlesssuperamplitude ] ) to the gluonic park - taylor amplitudes by supersymmetry , and ensures correct couplings .",
    "interestingly , following the discussion in , from super - momentum conservation , the cut of any @xmath272 super - yang - mills multi - loop super amplitude @xmath302 is proportional to the overall super - momentum conservation constraint , _ a=1^n^(2)(q^a ) .",
    "[ supermomentumconstraint ] as for the @xmath0 theory , the fact that this structure factors out in all cuts implies that complete on - shell loop amplitudes also contain a factor of the overall supermomentum conservation constraint .",

    "an example in this direction are orbifolds of @xmath0 sym .",

    "the fact that supersum calculations do not depend on whether amplitudes are planar or not , hints that a closer relation might exist between the amplitudes of the orbifolded and parent theory even at the nonplanar level .",
    "considerations similar to those discussed above also hold for supergravity , where one can write down generating functions for the mhv and sectors for @xmath303 starting from the @xmath3 generating function given in refs .",
    "furthermore , one can write down generating functions for more general non - supersymmetric matter content . one interesting example is dictated by the set of index diagrams with even numbers of index lines routed identically , giving a bosonic state - sum , @xmath304 corresponding to a theory of gluons and scalars arising from the dimensional reduction of pure yang - mills theory from six to four dimensions .",
    "the amplitudes of this theory thus also possess a generating function description .",
    "it should also be possible to extend these considerations to theories not obtainable from @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory by truncation .",

    "as discussed above , the purely gluonic contributions are represented in index diagrammatic language by grouping all index lines into sets of four following identical paths through the diagrams .",
    "the key observation is that the purely gluonic diagrams cover all possible paths .",
    "this allows us to use the enumeration of only gluonic helicity configurations in the cuts to obtain the contributions of all other states .",

    "the simplified rules for obtaining the @xmath0 super - yang - mills numerators of the @xmath12-gluon amplitudes from the purely gluonic cases are :    * identify all non - vanishing purely gluonic helicity choices .",
    "if the cut contains a tree amplitude which is neither mhv nor , expand it in mhv vertices as discussed in .",
    "each helicity choice then belongs to one independent configuration of holomorphicity of mhv and tree amplitudes .",
    "( recall that at four points , the mhv and tree amplitudes are equivalent and should be treated as as dependent . )",
    "each independent configuration of holomorphicity will form a distinct contribution , which are summed over at the end . * for each independent choice of holomorphicity , form the sum over all gluonic helicity configurations , assigning one power of @xmath305 for mhv amplitudes with negative helicity legs @xmath64 and @xmath52 and one power of @xmath306 for amplitudes with positive helicity legs @xmath64 and @xmath52 . *",

    "5 truein    as a nonplanar example , consider the cut depicted in .",
    "as far as the supersums are concerned the planarity or nonplanarity of the cut , is of little consequence , with the only difference appearing in the spinor denominators which are identical for all terms in the sum .",
    "this is an especially useful cut because it checks a large number of contributions to the four - loop amplitude , including the most complicated nonplanar integrals .",
    "as for previous examples , it turns out that there are two distinct choices of holomorphicity , corresponding to ( a ) and ( b ) in , since any helicity configuration falls into one of these two classes . in the first class ( a ) we have seven distinct gluonic helicity choices . in the second class ( b ) we have eight distinct gluonic helicity choices .",

    "many of the tools presented in previous sections , which were derived from the on - shell superspace of @xmath0 super - yang - mills , carry directly over to @xmath3 supergravity . for cuts that factorize loop amplitudes into only mhv and tree amplitudes ,",
    "the methods of the previous sections can be generalized to @xmath3 supergravity by replacing @xmath328 , and by suitably replacing the other factors in the amplitudes with the crossing symmetric gravity expressions . in this case",
    "the @xmath8-symmetry index runs up to eight .",
    "however , at present the existence of a complete set of mhv expansion rules for gravity has not been fully established  @xcite . as such , there are many gravity cuts that can not be handled directly by relying on an mhv expansion .",
    "one may use the bcfw recursion form of the tree - level superamplitudes in the unitarity cuts , but this has not been studied systematically beyond one loop  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the issue of four - dimensional cuts being insufficient for reconstructing the @xmath6-dimensional amplitude is more pressing in the case of gravity .",
    "the presence of twice as many powers of momenta in the numerators of gravity diagrams , compared to gauge theory , offers more possibilities for expressions that vanish in four dimensions , but not in @xmath6 dimensions , to appear in the cuts .",
    "an example of such an object is the gram determinant @xmath329 , with at least five independent momenta ( including loop momenta ) .",
    "a method that effectively tackles both of these problem is described in refs .",
    "@xcite : the tree level kawai - lewellen - tye ( klt ) relations can be used to relate cuts of @xmath3 supergravity to sums of products of cuts @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory , with additional kinematic factors .",
    "since the klt relations are valid in @xmath6 dimensions , the gravity cuts determined through their use will automatically be valid in arbitrary dimensions if the corresponding yang - mills cuts are .",
    "schematically , the klt relations are of the form @xmath330 where @xmath331 is an @xmath12-point @xmath3 supergravity amplitude , the @xmath332 are color - stripped @xmath12-point tree amplitudes in @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory labeled by an index @xmath64 , implicitly incorporating all labels appearing in the amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath333 are polynomials in kinematic invariants @xmath334 of degree @xmath335 .",
    "the precise form of the relations for any number of external legs may be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "while their derivation from the ( super)gravity lagrangian remains obscure , it was recently shown that the klt relations are equivalent to relations between numerator factors of individual tree diagrams  @xcite .",
    "generalized unitarity cuts in @xmath3 supergravity are constructed , in much the same way as in @xmath0 sym , as products of tree - level amplitudes . because the @xmath3 supergravity multiplet is the tensor product of two @xmath0 super - yang - mills vector multiplets , when applying the klt relations , the supersymmetric sums appearing in the cuts for supergravity amplitudes can be re - expressed as two copies of supersymmetric sums for yang - mills amplitudes .",
    "for example , for a cut that breaks the amplitude into two tree amplitudes we have  @xcite , m_n^l - loop |_cut= _ m_n_1^treem_n_2^tree & = & _ ( _ i , j g_ij a_n_1^(i ) a_n_1^(j ) ) ( _ k , l g_kl a_n_2^(k ) a_n_2^(l ) ) & = & _ i , j , k , l g_ijg_kl ( _ a_n_1^(i)a_n_2^(k ) ) ( _ a_n_1^(j)a_n_2^(l ) ) , where the @xmath336 are color - stripped cuts of @xmath0 super - yang - mills amplitudes .",
    "any cut which decomposes a loop amplitude into a product of trees works similarly .",
    "thus , instead of evaluating the supergravity cuts starting from @xmath6-dimensional supergravity tree amplitudes , it is generally more efficient to assemble them from simpler cuts of the yang - mills amplitude via the klt relations  @xcite .",
    "since the klt relations also hold for gravity theories with fewer supersymmetries than the maximal number , the gauge theory discussion in can be carried over to gravity as well . whenever a gravity theory is the low - energy limit of a string theory , we are guaranteed that the klt relations will hold ; this includes the vast number of heterotic string constructions  @xcite .",
    "the relations appear to apply even more generally than dictated by the heterotic string constructions  @xcite . in general",
    ", the klt construction may give undesirable states in the tensor product , such as an dilaton and antisymmetric tensor in the @xmath291 case ; to remove their contributions additional projections would be required .",
    "in this paper we described techniques for evaluating sums over the multiplet of states appearing in the four - dimensional generalized unitarity cuts of multi - loop super - yang - mills amplitudes .",
    "we used these techniques to expose general features of the cut amplitudes .",
    "our approach for evaluating the supersums in cuts is inspired by the one of bianchi , elvang , kiermaier and freedman  @xcite and based on the mhv expansion of tree amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "here we reorganized the contributions in two ways : first , as a linear system of algebraic equations , and , in the second , in terms of diagrams tracking the flow of @xmath7 @xmath8-symmetry indices .",
    "an important advantage of the algebraic approach is that simplifications based on schouten s identity are obtained automatically .",
    "this is a natural approach for carrying out formal derivations of properties of amplitudes . on the other hand ,",
    "the diagrammatic approach makes it straightforward to construct results by drawing simple diagrams and leads to an easily programmable algorithm for evaluating supersums by sweeping over possible purely gluonic configurations .",
    "the expressions obtained this way can be further simplified through use of schouten s identity and momentum conservation ; we described graphical rules for carrying out such manipulations , whose effect is to improve the power count by replacing some of the numerator loop momenta of cuts with external momenta .",
    "we also used the index - diagram approach to construct a generating function for certain theories with less - than - maximal supersymmetry .",
    "this is straightforward because the index - diagram approach tracks the contributions of individual configurations of states in the cuts .",
    "this allowed us to give simple rules determining the contributions of various gauge multiplets to cuts .",
    "it should be possible to further generalize these considerations to supersymmetric theories with arbitrary matter content .    in general",
    ", completely determining the integrand of amplitudes requires the evaluation of unitarity cuts in an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "in particular , use of dimensional regularization to control infrared or ultraviolet singularities implies that the amplitudes can not be evaluated in strictly four dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , in practical calculations , four - dimensional cuts provide invaluable guidance for constructing an ansatz , whose cuts can be verified through the more complicated @xmath6 dimensional cuts . the efficient and systematic evaluation of supermultiplet sums in arbitrary dimensions remains an important open problem .",
    "one obstacle arises from the strong dependence of on - shell superspaces on the specific dimensionality of space - time , making it difficult to treat all dimensions in a unified way .",
    "another difficulty is the absence of a formalism as efficient as four - dimensional spinor helicity in general dimensions .",
    "recent progress towards solving the latter problem is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a six - dimensional helicity - like formalism is constructed .",
    "the klt  @xcite relations allow us to rewrite any product of tree - level amplitudes in @xmath3 supergravity representing the generalized cut of some multi - loop amplitude directly in terms of double products of cuts of @xmath0 super - yang - mills amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to immediately carry over to @xmath3 supergravity @xmath0 super - yang - mills evaluations of supersums .",
    "higher - loop studies of @xmath337 supergravity should help shed further light on the recent proposal that @xmath3 supergravity may be a perturbatively finite theory of quantum gravity  @xcite .    in summary",
