    "in summary , we have analyzed the temperature and field dependence of magnetization of the prfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 superconductor .",
    "the magnetization of the compound can be understood as a sum of the superconducting irreversible signal , @xmath3 originating from the pinning flux lines and a paramagnetic component , @xmath4 arising from the magnetic moment of pr@xmath6 ion .",
    "the critical current density exhibits a second peak at a magnetic field well below @xmath124 line .",
    "the critical current density is almost independent of @xmath25 up to a field @xmath9 and then decreases rapidly with a power law @xmath10 which is the characteristic of strong pinning .",
    "the evaluated elementary pinning force , @xmath110 and the density of pinning centers , @xmath109 are larger than those for prfeaso@xmath22 single crystal .",
    "this indicates that the oxygen deficiency is useful to increase the critical current density .",
    "the @xmath25-@xmath141 phase diagram for the present system has been obtained using the magnetization and resistivity data .",
    "the authors would like to thank a. pal and s. banerjee for technical help during sample preparation and measurements .",
    "a. banerjee would also like to thank dst , india for financial assistance for the 14 t vibrating sample magnetometer facility at csr , indore .",
