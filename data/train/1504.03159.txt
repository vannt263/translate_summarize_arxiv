    "modifying an earlier idea by born  @xcite , in 1934 born and infeld @xcite suggested a nonlinear modification of vacuum electrodynamics in order to get rid of the infinite self - energies of point particles that occur in the standard maxwell theory .",
    "their theory can be derived from a lorentz - invariant lagrangian .",
    "a few years later , heisenberg and euler  @xcite derived an effective lagrangian , again lorentz - invariant , from quantum electrodynamics .",
    "these are the two best known examples within the class of all lorentz - invariant nonlinear electrodynamical theories .",
    "more generally , plebaski @xcite and also boillat  @xcite studied the whole class of nonlinear electrodynamical theories that can be derived from a lagrangian depending only on the two lorentz - invariant scalars that are quadratic in the field strength .",
    "this class is often referred to as _ plebaski nonlinear electrodynamics_. for a review of the born - infeld theory we refer , e.g. , to biaynicki - birula  @xcite .",
    "the physical relevance of these nonlinear vacuum electrodynamical theories is being widely discussed in the literature .",
    "it is believed that at a certain field strength the heisenberg - euler deviations from standard maxwell theory should be observable , and the born - infeld theory has gained increasing attention since it was realized by tseytlin @xcite that the born - infeld lagrangian can be derived as an effective lagrangian from some versions of string theory .",
    "observable effects of ( nonlinear ) modifications of the vacuum maxwell equations have been discussed for many years , at least since the ph.d .",
    "thesis of toll  @xcite . up to now ,",
    "the only effect predicted by such modified theories that has already been observed is light - by - light scattering ( see @xcite ) ; further experiments are under way , e.g. with the large hadron collider at cern @xcite .",
    "there is also an ongoing experiment @xcite aiming at verifying the birefringence _ in vacuo _ as predicted by the heisenberg - euler theory .",
    "also , it might be possible to measure the influence of background fields on the propagation speed of light in the laboratory .",
    "for the case of the born - infeld theory , such experiments have been suggested with the help of wave guides by ferraro @xcite and with homogeneous magnetic background fields by dereli and tucker @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on another method for testing nonlinear electrodynamics and discuss its theoretical foundations in detail .",
    "the basic idea is to measure the influence of a ( strong ) background field on the propagation speed of light with the help of an interferometer .",
    "such an experiment has been suggested and discussed already in five earlier papers  @xcite .",
    "however , all of them restrict the theoretical discussion to the heisenberg - euler theory or , in the case of denisov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , to the heisenberg - euler and the born - infeld theory .",
    "what is still missing is a comprehensive derivation of the relevant equations that cover the whole plebaski class .",
    "the basic idea of the experiment is simple . in the standard maxwell vacuum theory , which is linear , the superposition principle holds , so there is no influence of a background field on the propagation of light . in the nonlinear theories , however , the phase velocity of light depends on the strength of the background field and on the propagation direction relative to the background field .",
    "this can be tested with a michelson interferometer : if a strong background field is switched on and off in one interferometer arm , or if the whole interferometer is being rotated in a strong background field , the interference pattern should change .",
    "a null result would place bounds on the possible deviations from standard maxwell vacuum theory .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to develop the theoretical foundations for this experimental test for an unspecified nonlinear electrodynamical theory of the plebaski class .",
    "we will then specify to born , born - infeld and heisenberg - euler theory .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we consider minkowski space as the underlying space - time model .",
    "we work in inertial coordinates , so the minkowski metric is @xmath0 .",
    "we use einstein s summation convention for latin indices taking values 1,2,3,4 and for greek indices taking values 1,2,3 . indices are raised and lowered with the minkowski metric . we will use gaussian cgs units throughout , because they are most convenient for our theoretical investigations . in these units , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "are all measured in the same units , @xmath5 .",
    "the reader can easily convert the results into si units with the help of the formulas @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "for example , for a field @xmath10 in gaussian cgs units , where @xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 , one gets @xmath12    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ vorbereitung ] we recall the basic equations for the propagation of light rays according to nonlinear electrodynamics . then in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] the suggested interferometer experiment is described and in sec .  [ konkretes ] some particular applications are discussed .",
    "the nonlinear electrodynamical theories which are at the center of our examination derive from an action @xmath13=\\frac{1}{4\\pi c}\\int _ m",
    "\\left(\\mathcal{l}(f_{mn})+\\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\,j^ma_m \\right)\\,\\mathrm dv_4 \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is a _ given _ current density , @xmath15 is the electromagnetic potential , @xmath16 is the electromagnetic field strength and @xmath17 is the larangian for the electromagnetic field .",
    "then the homogeneous group of maxwell s equations is automatically satisfied , @xmath18}=0 \\ , .\\ ] ] variation of the action with respect to the potential @xmath15 leads to the inhomogeneous group of maxwell s equations , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electromagnetic excitation .",
    "it is the constitutive law ( [ eq : const ] ) that distinguishes different theories , while the maxwell equations ( [ eq : max1 ] ) and ( [ eq : max2 ] ) are always the same .",
    "following plebaski @xcite , we require that the electromagnetic lagrangian @xmath17 depends on the electromagnetic field strength only via the lorentz invariants @xmath21 here and in the following , the tilde denotes the hodge dual , @xmath22 as usual , @xmath23 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor with @xmath24 .",
    "strictly speaking , only @xmath25 is invariant under _ all _ lorentz transformations while @xmath26 changes sign under a parity transformation .",
    "some authors restrict to lagrangians that satisfy the equation @xmath27 to assure invariance under parity transformations .",
    "however , for the purpose of this paper there is no need for this restriction .",
    "the plebaski class contains , of course , the standard vacuum maxwell theory which is given by the lagrangian @xmath28 as this theory is well tested for weak fields , many authors restrict their work to theories where the lagrangian satisfies @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "again , for our mathematical considerations there is no need for this restriction .    for a theory of the plebaski class the constitutive law ( [ eq : const ] ) can be written , more specifically , as @xmath31 where @xmath32",
    "later we will also write @xmath33    additionally we will use a hamiltonian formulation of the pleba ' nski electrodynamics .",
    "for the special case of the born - infeld theory , the hamiltonian formulation can be found in  @xcite whereas the lagrangian depends on the field strength , the hamiltonian depends on the excitation . quite generally , for any theory based on a lagrangian @xmath34",
    ", the passage to the hamiltonian formalism can be performed whenever the constitutive law ( [ eq : const ] ) can be solved for @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then given by a covariant legendre transformation , @xmath36 where , on the right - hand side , @xmath37 has to be expressed in terms of @xmath38 with the help of the constitutive law .",
    "for a theory of the plebaski class ( i.e. , if the lagrangian depends only on @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , the hamiltonian is a function of the two invariants @xmath39 the relevant equations for the passage from the lagrangian to the hamiltonian description are given in the appendix .",
    "there we will also give a criterion that guarantees that the constitutive law ( [ eq : hab ] ) can be solved for the field strength , at least locally .",
    "in the following we will often use three - vector notation .",
    "the field strength has the three - dimensional representation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the totally antisymmetric spatial levi - civita tensor , @xmath42 . with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,",
    "the invariants ( [ eq : fg ] ) read @xmath46 analogously we write for the excitation @xmath47 which implies that the invariants ( [ eq : rs ] ) are given by @xmath48 then the constitutive law ( [ eq : hab ] ) reads @xmath49      the characteristic surfaces determined by a set of partial differential equations can be defined as the hypersurfaces along which the solutions may have discontinuities . as an alternative , the characteristic surfaces can also be defined with the help of approximate plane waves ; in this second approach , they come about as the high - frequency limit of the surfaces of constant phase . in view of applications to electrodynamics , the first approach is discussed , e.g. , in the book by hehl and obukhov @xcite . the characteristic surfaces are hypersurfaces @xmath51 , where the gradient of @xmath52 has to satisfy , at each point of space - time , a fourth - order equation which is known as the _ dispersion relation _ or as the _ fresnel equation_. if viewed as a partial differential equation for @xmath52 , this equation is usually called the _ characteristic equation _ or the _ eikonal equation_. using this approach , obukhov and rubilar  @xcite have determined the fresnel equation ( i.e. , the characteristic equation ) for an arbitrary @xmath53 theory . earlier , novello _ et al . _",
    "@xcite had found an equivalent result in a different way .",
    "their results show that , with the exception of a few special cases , theories of the plebaski class predict birefringence _ in vacuo_. for background material on birefringence , and bimetricity , we refer to visser _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and , for the particular case of the heisenberg - euler theory , to dittrich and gies  @xcite and to shore  @xcite .    here",
    "we want to briefly sketch how the fresnel equation of an arbitray @xmath54 theory can be derived with the help of an approximate - plane - wave ansatz .",
    "this is methodically different from the work of obukhov and rubilar  @xcite and novello _ et al . _",
    "@xcite but it leads to the same result .",
    "the general method goes back to luneburg and is outlined , e.g. , for electrodynamics in ordinary media , in the book by kline and kay  @xcite . for a discussion in a more general context , which includes the case to be considered here , we refer to perlick  @xcite .",
    "we consider a one - parameter family of electromagnetic fields of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a given background field .",
    "@xmath57 is a real bookkeeping parameter that is introduced in a way such that the high - frequency limit corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "the summation sign in ( [ eq : pw ] ) is to be understood in the sense of an asymptotic series and _ not _ in the sense of a convergent series .",
    "while the amplitudes @xmath59 are in general complex , the _ eikonal function _",
    "@xmath52 is real .",
    "it gives the surfaces of constant phase , @xmath60 .",
    "in 3-space , the normal to these surfaces is @xmath61 the phase velocity @xmath62 can be introduced as the 3-vector that gives the traveling speed of such a surface in the direction of its normal , @xmath63 feeding the ansatz ( [ eq : pw ] ) into maxwell s equations and comparing equal powers of @xmath57 gives a hierarchy of equations . in the lowest nontrivial order , which is known as the geometric optics approximation ,",
    "one gets a first - order partial differential equation for @xmath52 which is the desired characteristic equation .",
    "if this program is carried through for an @xmath53 theory , one finds the following result which is in agreement with obukhov and rubilar s  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic equation reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 if @xmath67 has no zeros , ( [ eq : q ] ) can be factorized as @xmath68 where @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the following we restrict ourselves to lagrangians such that @xmath67 and @xmath72 have no zeros .",
    "this excludes some degenerate cases which are hardly of physical interest .",
    "then the characteristic equation is equivalent to ( which is up to conformal transformations in agreement with the results of novello _ _ et al.__@xcite ) @xmath73 and is sometimes called the `` light - cone condition '' ( compare for example  @xcite ) .",
    "generalizing a standard terminology from electrodynamics in media , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are called the _ optical metrics _ of the vacuum in the @xmath53 theory .",
    "if the two optical metrics do not coincide , i.e. , if @xmath76 , there is birefringence in vacuum .",
    "if one considers the next order in the above - mentioned hierarchy of equations , one sees that the case @xmath77 and the case @xmath78 correspond to two different polarization directions .",
    "note that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are always real , because @xmath81 is a sum of two squares , and that @xmath82 and @xmath83 depend only on the two field invariants @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the standard vacuum maxwell theory we have @xmath84 , so these two functions characterize the deviation of our @xmath53 theory from the standard theory at the level of geometric optics .    if the lagrangian is of the special form @xmath85 with some constant factors @xmath86 and @xmath87 , one has @xmath88 and therefore @xmath89 , i.e. , one polarization mode behaves as in the standard maxwell vacuum theory .",
    "this is true , in particular , if the lagrangian is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "( it is also true if the lagrangian is independent of @xmath25 but this case was excluded by our assumption @xmath90 . ) also , it is interesting to remark that two lagrangians @xmath17 and @xmath91 give the same characteristic equation , i.e. the two cases are not distinguishable at the level of geometrical optics .",
    "of course , if one restricts to parity invariant lagrangians adding a term of the form @xmath92 is forbidden .",
    "for some of our applications it will be desirable to write the optical metrics in terms of the excitation , rather than in terms of the field strength .",
    "it is then recommendable to start from a hamiltonian formulation .",
    "it was mentioned already at the end of sec .",
    "[ subsec : pleb ] that the plebaski class of theories can be written in terms of a hamiltonian @xmath93 rather than in terms of a lagrangian @xmath53 . in the appendix",
    "we derive some replacement rules of how the relevant hamiltonian expressions can be found from the lagrangian expressions . by applying these replacement rules",
    ", we find that the optical metrics can be rewritten as @xmath94 where @xmath95 with the abbreviations @xmath96    in the following it will be convenient to use the three - vector notation of ( [ eq : eb ] ) and ( [ eq : dh ] ) . we decompose each of the 3-vectors @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 into amplitude and direction , @xmath101 & \\boldsymbol e ( x^\\mu , t ) = e(x^\\mu , t)\\,\\boldsymbol w(x^\\mu , t)\\ , , \\\\[0.1 cm ] & \\boldsymbol h ( x^\\mu , t ) = h(x^\\mu , t)\\,\\boldsymbol r(x^\\mu , t)\\ , , \\\\[0.1 cm ] & \\boldsymbol d ( x^\\mu , t ) = d(x^\\mu , t)\\,\\boldsymbol s(x^\\mu , t ) \\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 . the spatial and temporal parts of @xmath103 , which enter into ( [ eq : a1a2 ] ) , can then be written as @xmath104-e^2\\left(\\boldsymbol w \\cdot \\boldsymbol p\\right)^2 \\\\ \\label{eq : ff } f^{4",

    "the corresponding set of hamilton equations , or canonical equations , determines the _ bicharacteristic curves _ or _ rays_. for background material on the notions of characteristics and bicharacteristics we refer to courant and hilbert @xcite .",

    "the canonical equations read @xmath110 here @xmath111 is a parameter along the rays which has no obvious physical meaning . in the following",
    "it will be convenient to reparametrize the rays by the time coordinate @xmath112 , cf .",
    "@xcite . in order to do this",
    ", we have to assume that the rays of the hamiltonian @xmath113 are causal ( i.e. , timelike or lightlike ) with respect to the minkowski background metric .",

    "we will investigate this question in a separate paper ; here we just restrict our discussion , from now on , to lagrangians where the rays of the optical metrics are causal with respect to the background minkowski metric .",

    "equation ( [ geschbeding ] ) is satisfied in the usual vacuum theory of maxwell but not in general in other @xmath53 theories .",
    "note that ( [ geschbeding ] ) implies @xmath127 i.e. , the condition @xmath128 can hold only if @xmath129 and @xmath130 are parallel .",

    "there are two ways in which michelson interferometry can be used for testing nonlinear electrodynamics .",

    ", one could also use a pair of optical resonators as they have been used for high - precision michelson - morley experiments in recent years . as these resonators have a typical size of only a few centimeters , one would do the experiment with the whole instrument placed in a background field . with the resonators oriented perpendicularly to each other",
    ", one would then compare the situation where the field is switched on with the situation where it is switched off , or one would rotate the whole instrument with keeping the field switched on .    in the following",
    "we first discuss the setup of the experiment where a traditional michelson interferometer is used and the field is placed in one arm .",
    "this is the variant which brings out the basic idea of the experiment most clearly . later in this section",
    "we discuss the other variants .",

    "this would lead to a change of the interference pattern .",
    "we consider the background field to be static , with one of the four fields @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , or @xmath100 vanishing .",
    "each of these four cases is covered by the calculations of the preceding section .",
    "we assume that the background field is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light .",
    "we have seen that in this situation the ray does not deviate from a straight line .",
    "obviously the travel times of the ray along the different sections are given by @xmath166 without background field the phase velocity is equal to @xmath164 everywhere , including the region @xmath159 .",

    "since born and infeld created their `` new field theory '' of electromagnetism @xcite , different nonlinear modifications of vacuum electrodynamics on the basis of a lagrangian @xmath54 have been discussed , where usually one considers only those theories that reproduce the standard vacuum maxwell theory in sufficiently weak fields .",
    "all these new electrodynamical theories have in common that they predict that light travels along the null cones of two optical metrics , one for each polarization state , where at least one of them differs from the vacuum maxwell light - cone . at the same time",
    "they introduce at least one new dimensionfull constant of nature .    while in the standard vacuum maxwell theory",

    ", an electromagnetic background field would have an effect on the propagation of electromagnetic waves and thus , in particular , on the phase velocity of light .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the optical metrics depend on the background field .",
    "the best technique for measuring small changes in the phase velocity of light with high accuracy is interferometry . in this paper",
    "we worked out the mathematical details for using interferometry as a test of @xmath53 theories .    in cases where the constants of nature that enter into the theory are known , as e.g. in the heisenberg - euler theory ,",
    "an interferometric experiment could be used for confirming the theory by verifying the prediction .",
    "if instead the constants of nature that enter into the theory are not known , as e.g. in the born - infeld theory , a null result of the experiment would give bounds on these constants .",
    "our estimates demonstrate that , with realistic ( magnetic ) fields , an interferometric experiment could place significant bounds on the born - infeld constant @xmath221 .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of the heisenberg - euler theory our estimates seem to indicate that a confirmation of the theory is not realizable with electromagnetic fields that can be achieved in present - day experiments .",
    "however , it might be possible to considerably enhance the sensitivity by using time - dependent background fields , rather than the static fields we have considered for our numerical estimates . for the case of testing the heisenberg - euler theory with an interferometer of the size of a gravitational wave detector , this possibility was discussed in detail recently by grote @xcite .",
    "the idea is to change the background field periodically with a frequency @xmath174 , e.g. by rotating a permanent magnet .",
    "as long as @xmath174 is small in comparison to the frequency of the laser light used in the interferometer , our equations could still be used for this situation in the sense of an adiabatic approximation .",
    "if the laser light is polarized , rotating the background field would lead to a periodically varying signal according to any theory that predicts birefringence _ in vacuo_. ( unfortunately , this excludes the born - infeld theory . ) by choosing long integration times  grote suggests to run the experiment for a year  one could improve the statistics in such a way that it might be possible to reach the sensitivity for testing the heisenberg - euler theory .",
    "a similar analysis has not been carried through for the small - scale experiment so far .",
    "we will leave this for other authors , as it goes beyond the scope of the present paper which was to lay the theoretical foundations of the experiment in the context of an arbitrary @xmath54 theory .    finally , we add a remark on pulsed background fields .",
    "pulsed magnetic fields and also laser pulses ( pulsed null fields ) can be produced with considerably higher field strengths than static or slowly varying fields .",
    "for example , pulsed magnetic fields of @xmath330 have already been produced in the laboratory .",
    "however , these fields persist only for short times , so the adiabatic approximation would not be valid which makes the theory considerably more difficult .",
    "moreover , there are several technical obstacles .",
    "for example , we see major experimental difficulties towards a realization of the small - scale experiment with ( pulsed ) magnetic fields of @xmath331 because of magnetostriction . also , for the experiment with a pulsed null field as a background one would wish to have the pulse traveling in the same direction as the laser beam in the interferometer , to make sure that the latter does not deviate from a straight line .",
    "this can not be done without changing the geometry of the interferometer , neither for the small - scale nor for the large - scale experiment .",
    "for these reasons , we have restricted our specific calculations to time - independent background fields ( which includes the case of slowly varying fields in the sense of an adiabatic approximation ) .",
