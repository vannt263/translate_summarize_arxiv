    "it extends up to several hundred arcsecs from the center of the milky way ( sgr a * ) and its mass within 1 pc is @xmath16 with @xmath17 uncertainty @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that the center of the nsc hosts a smbh of several million solar masses .",
    "estimates from stellar orbits show that the smbh mass is @xmath18 @xcite . due to its proximity",
    ", individual stars can be resolved and number counts can be derived ; however , due to the strong interstellar extinction the stars can only be observed in the infrared .",
    "a large number of proper motions and line - of - sight velocities have been measured , and analyzed with spherical models to attempt to constrain the nsc dynamics and mass @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time of the nsc within 1 pc is @xmath19 yr @xcite , indicating that the nsc is not fully relaxed and is likely to be evolving .",
    "one would expect from theoretical models that , if relaxed , the stellar density near the smbh should be steeply - rising and form a @xcite cusp .",
    "in contrast , observations by @xcite show that the distribution of old stars near the smbh appears to have a core .",
    "understanding the nuclear star cluster dynamics may therefore give useful constraints on the mechanisms by which it formed and evolved @xcite .",
    "in this work we construct axisymmetric jeans and two - integral distribution function models based on stellar number counts , proper motions , and line - of - sight velocities .",
    "we describe the data briefly in section  [ sdataset ] ; for more detail the reader is referred to the companion paper of @xcite . in section  [ sspherical ]",
    "we carry out a preliminary study of the nsc dynamics using isotropic spherical models , in view of understanding the effect of rotation on the data . in section [ saxis ]",

    "the appendix contains some details on our use of the @xcite algorithm to calculate the two - integral distribution function for the fitted density model .",
    "we first give a brief description of the data set used for our dynamical analysis .",
    "these data are taken from @xcite and are thoroughly examined in that paper , which should be consulted for more details .",
    "the coordinate system used is a shifted galactic coordinate system ( @xmath21 ) where sgr a * is at the center and ( @xmath21 ) are parallel to galactic coordinates ( @xmath22 ) . in the following we always refer to the shifted coordinates but",
    "will omit the asterisks for simplicity .",
    "the dataset consists of stellar number densities , proper motions and line - of - sight velocities .",
    "we use the stellar number density map rather than the surface brightness map because it is less sensitive to individual bright stars and non - uniform extinction .",
    "the stellar number density distribution is constructed from naco high - resolution images for @xmath23 , in a similar way as in @xcite , from hst wfc3/ir data for @xmath24 , and from vista - vvv data for @xmath25 .",
    "the kinematic data include proper motions for @xmath2610000 stars obtained from ao assisted images .",
    "the proper motion stars are binned into 58 cells ( figure [ plot_5 ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) according to distance from sgr a * and the galactic plane .",
    "this binning assumes that the nsc is symmetric with respect to the galactic plane and with respect to the @xmath27-axis on the sky , consistent with axisymmetric dynamical modeling .",
    "the sizes of the bins are chosen such that all bins contain comparable numbers of stars , and the velocity dispersion gradients are resolved , i.e. , vary by less than the error bars between adjacent bins .",
    "relative to the large velocity dispersions at the galactic center ( 100 km / s ) , measurement errors for individual stars are typically @xmath28 , much smaller than in typical globular cluster proper motion data where they can be @xmath17 ( e.g. , in omega cen ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore corrections for these measurement errors are very small .",
    "we also use @xmath262500 radial velocities obtained from sinfoni integral field spectroscopy .",

    "the distribution of radial velocity stars on the sky is different from the distribution of proper motion stars , and it is not symmetric with respect to @xmath29 . because of this and the observed rotation , the binning is different , and extends to both positive and negative longitudes .",
    "both the proper motion and radial velocity binning are also used in @xcite and some tests are described in that paper .    finally , we compare our models with ( but do not fit to ) the kinematics derived from about 200 maser velocities at @xmath30 ( from * ? ? ?",

    "the advantages of using a distribution function instead of common jeans modeling are that ( i ) we can always check if a df is positive and therefore if the model is physical , and ( ii ) the df provides us with all the moments of the system . for the rest of the paper we use @xmath33 for spherical and @xmath34 for cylindrical coordinates , with @xmath35 corresponding to the z - axis normal to the equatorial plane of the nsc .",

    "the surface density distribution can be approximated by a two - component model of the form of equation  ( [ eqdensph ] ) , where the six parameters @xmath58 are fitted to the data subject to the following constraints : the slope of the inner component should be @xmath59 because isotropic models with a black hole and @xmath60 are unphysical @xcite , but it should be close to the limiting value of 0.5 to better approximate the observed core near the center @xcite . for the outer component",

    "we assume that the rotation axis of the nsc is aligned with the rotation axis of the milky way disk .",
    "we also use a cartesian coordinate system @xmath86 where @xmath87 is parallel to the axis of rotation as before , @xmath88 is along the line of sight , and @xmath89 is along the direction of negative longitude , with the center of the nsc located at the origin .",
    "the proper motion data are given in galactic longitude @xmath84 and galactic latitude @xmath27 angles , but because of the large distance to the center , we can assume that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    whether a spherical system can rotate has been answered in @xcite .",
    "here we give a brief review .",
    "rotation in a spherical or axisymmetric system can be added self - consistently by reversing the sense of rotation of some of its stars .",
    "doing so , the system will remain in equilibrium .",
    "this is equivalent with adding to the df a part that is odd with respect to @xmath92 .",
    "the addition of an odd part does not affect the density ( or the mass ) because the integral of the odd part over velocity space is zero .",
    "the most effective way to add rotation to a spherical system is by reversing the sense of rotation of all of its counterrotating stars .",
    "this corresponds to adding @xmath93 ( maxwell s daemon , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the initially non - rotating df , and generates a system with the maximum allowable rotation . the general case of adding rotation to a spherical system can be written @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an odd function with @xmath96 to ensure positivity of the df .",
    "we notice that the new distribution function is a three - integral df . in this case",
    "the density of the system is still rotationally invariant but @xmath97 is not .     and",
    "two @xmath98 values for illustration .",
    "each data point corresponds to a cell from figure [ plot_6 ] .",
    "velocities at negative @xmath84 have been folded over with their signs reversed and are shown in red .",
    "the plot also includes the maser data at @xmath99 .",
    "the model prediction is computed for @xmath100 . for comparison ,",
    "cells with centers between @xmath101 and @xmath102 are highlighted with filled triangles . ]    in figure [ plot_3 ] we notice that the projected velocity dispersion in the @xmath84 direction is larger than the dispersion in the @xmath27 direction which was first found by @xcite .",
    "this is particularly apparent for distances larger than @xmath103 .",
    "a heuristic attempt to explain this difference was made in @xcite where they imposed a rotation of the form @xmath104 along with their jeans modeling , as a proxy for axisymmetric modeling . here",
    "we show that for a self - consistent system the difference in the projected @xmath84 and @xmath27 dispersions can not be explained by just adding rotation to the cluster .",
    "specifically , we show that adding an odd part to the distribution function does not change the proper motion dispersion @xmath105 .",
    "the dispersion along the @xmath89 axis is @xmath106 .",
    "writing @xmath107 in spherical velocity components ( see the beginning of this section for the notation ) , @xmath108 we see that @xmath109 the second term vanishes because @xmath110 is even in @xmath111 , @xmath112 and odd in @xmath113 , so that the integrand for all terms of @xmath114 is odd in at least one velocity variable .",
    "we also have @xmath115 the first part is zero because @xmath116 is odd . the second part is different from zero ; however when projecting @xmath117 along the line - of - sight this term also vanishes because @xmath118 is an even function of @xmath88 when the integration is in a direction perpendicular to the @xmath92 angular momentum direction .",
    "hence the projected mean velocity @xmath119 is zero , and the velocity dispersion @xmath120 is unchanged .",
    "an alternative way to see this is by making a particle realization of the initial df ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". then we can add rotation by reversing the sign of @xmath92 of a percentage of particles using some probability function which is equivalent to changing the signs of @xmath107 and @xmath121 of those particles .",
    "@xmath122 will not be affected by the sign change and the @xmath123 averaged over the line - of - sight will be zero because for each particle at the front of the system rotating in a specific direction there will be another particle at the rear of the system rotating in the opposite direction . in this work",
    "we do not use particle models to avoid fluctuations due to the limited number of particles near the center .    for the odd part of the df we choose the two - parameter function from @xcite .",
    "this is a modified version of @xcite which was based on maximum entropy arguments : @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 is the maximum allowable value of @xmath92 at a given energy , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 are free parameters .",
    "the parameter f works as a global adjustment of rotation while the parameter @xmath98 determines the contributions of stars with different @xmath92 ratios .",
    "specifically for small @xmath98 only stars with high @xmath92 will contribute while large @xmath98 implies that all stars irrespective of their @xmath92 contribute to rotation .",
    "for f=1 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 which corresponds to maximum rotation .    from the resulting distribution function",
    "@xmath4 we can calculate @xmath131 in cylindrical coordinates using the equation @xmath132 to find the mean line - of - sight velocity versus galactic longitude @xmath84 we have to project equation  ( [ equphi ] ) to the sky plane @xmath133 figure [ plot_4 ] shows the mean line - of - sight velocity data vs galactic longitude @xmath84 for @xmath134 and two @xmath98 values for the parameters in equation  ( [ eqalpha ] ) .",
    "later in the axisymmetric section we constrain these parameters by fitting .",
    "each data point corresponds to a cell from figure [ plot_6 ] .",
    "the maser data ( @xmath135 ) are also included .",
    "the signs of velocities for negative @xmath84 are reversed because of the assumed symmetry .",
    "the line shows the prediction of the model with parameters determined with equation  ( [ ulos ] ) .",
    "figure [ plot_6 ] shows that the line - of - sight velocity cells extend from b=0 to up to @xmath136 , but most of them lie between 0 and @xmath100 .",
    "for this reason we compute the model prediction at an average value of @xmath100 .",
    "and @xmath27 directions @xcite in red and blue respectively .",
    "the blue lines show the model that gives the best fit to the surface density data with parameters as in [ bestsdvalues ] . ]",
    "we have seen that spherical models can not explain the difference between the velocity dispersions along the @xmath84 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "the number counts also show that the cluster is flattened ; see figure [ plot_7 ] and @xcite .",
    "therefore we now continue with axisymmetric modeling of the nuclear cluster .",
    "the first step is to fit the surface density counts with an axisymmetric density model .",
    "the available surface density data extend up to @xmath2 in the @xmath84 and @xmath27 directions . for comparison ,",
    "the proper motion data extend to @xmath137 from the centre ( figure [ plot_5 ] ) .",
    "we generalize our spherical two - component @xmath36-model from equation  ( [ eqdensph ] ) to a spheroidal model given by    @xmath138    where @xmath139 is the spheroidal radius and the two new parameters @xmath140 are the axial ratios ( prolate @xmath141 , oblate @xmath142 ) of the inner and outer component , respectively .",
    "note that the method can be generalized to n components .",
    "the mass of a single component is given by @xmath143 . from figure [ plot_7 ]",
    "we expect that the inner component will be more spherical than the outer component , although when the density profile gets flatter near the center it becomes more difficult to determine the axial ratio . in figure [ plot_7 ]",
    "one also sees that the stellar surface density along the @xmath84 direction is larger than along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "thus we assume that the nsc is an oblate system . to fit the model we first need to project the density and express it as a function of @xmath84 and @xmath27 .",
    "the projected surface density as seen edge on is @xmath144    in general , to fit equation  ( [ eqaxissd ] ) to the data we would need to determine the eight parameters @xmath145 .",
    "however , we decided to fix a value for @xmath146 because the second component is not very well confined in the 8-dimensional parameter space ( i.e. there are several models each with different @xmath146 and similar @xmath147 ) .",

    "there are two reasons for this difference : ( i ) at @xmath316 where the model is well - fixed by kinematic data the black hole still contributes more than half of the interior mass . in this region , flattening the cluster at constant mass leaves @xmath0 and @xmath207 approximately constant , but decreases @xmath1 to adjust to the shape .",
    "to fit the same observed data , the nsc mass must be increased .",
    "( ii ) because of the increasing flattening with radius , the average density of the axisymmetric model decreases faster than that of the spherical density fit ; thus for the same observed velocity dispersion profiles a larger binding mass for the nsc is required .",

    "however , identifying @xmath333 with the total mass of the galactic nsc at the center of the nuclear disk has considerable uncertainties : because the outer nsd component dominates the surface density outside @xmath334 , the nsc density profile slope at large radii is uncertain , and therefore the part of the mass outside @xmath335 ( @xmath336 of the total ) is also uncertain .",
    "a minimal estimate for the mass of the inner nsc component is its mass within @xmath337 up to where it dominates the star counts .",
