    "with the recent discovery of the ` higgs ' boson @xcite , all the ingredients of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) have been found .",
    "however , we do know that the sm does not fully explain the whole of the nature at its most fundamental level .",
    "for example , the problem of naturalness , the existence of extremely small masses for the neutrinos required to explain the observed neutrino oscillations , the abundance of matter over anti - matter in our observable universe , the constituents of dark matter ( which is about five times more abundant than the ordinary matter ) are a few of many issues which can not be handled in sm .",
    "so sm encompasses an incomplete description of nature and hence it must be supplemented or extended with some other hitherto unknown new physics .",
    "any model of new physics invariably includes new interactions and thus many new particles . in order to have a comprehensive view of new physics",
    "it is therefore essential to look for new fundamental particles in experiments such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) or in the proposed future experiments such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "it is however important to have model independent methods at place to characterize resonances that would be observed in these high luminosity and high energy experiments .",
    "this paper is a step forward in that direction .",
    "similar idea was espoused in ref .",
    "@xcite in connection with the @xmath2-@xmath3 ` higgs ' resonance . since the ` higgs ' was found to decay to two photons , the spin-1 possibility in this case was ruled out using landau - yang theorem .",
    "this paper , however , has the complete theoretical analysis and we do consider the spin-1 possibility here .",
    "the decay of a resonance to four leptons via a pair of @xmath0 bosons is considered as the gold plated mode for discovery of any resonance in a hadron collider such as lhc .",
    "this mode can be used to search for many new resonances , such as a heavy scalar resonance , a @xmath1 boson or a kaluza - klein boson or a massive graviton . hence , all the spin possibilities must be considered .",
    "we analyse the decay of a resonance ( say , @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 ) via this golden channel : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are leptons @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "since we are considering an unknown particle with unknown mass , it may be heavy enough to produce two real @xmath0 bosons or we can have one on - shell @xmath0 and another off - shell @xmath0 , or both the @xmath0 s can be off - shell .",
    "we emphasize that the final state @xmath11 is not equivalent to @xmath12 or @xmath13 as sometimes mentioned in the literature , since the latter final states have to be anti - symmetrized with respect to each of the two sets of identical fermions in the final state .",
    "the anti - symmetrization of the amplitudes is not done in our analysis and hence our analysis applies only to @xmath11 . since @xmath4 decays to two @xmath0 bosons which are vector bosons , @xmath4 can have spin possibilities",
    "higher spin possibilities ( @xmath15 ) need not be considered as the number of independent helicity amplitudes remains three ( for higher odd integer spins ) or six ( for higher even integer spins ) , and the only change in the amplitude comes from extra powers of momentum of the @xmath0 bosons  @xcite .",
    "this was shown by an example in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the angular distributions for the different spins @xmath16 and parity of such a new resonance @xmath4 and present a strategy to determine them , as well as the couplings of @xmath4 to the pair of @xmath0 bosons with the help of a few well defined experimental observables .",
    "we start by considering the most general effective lagrangian for each spin possibility of @xmath4 decaying to two @xmath0 bosons and then write down the corresponding decay vertices .",
    "we evaluate the partial decay rate of @xmath4 in terms of the invariant mass squared of the dileptons produced from the two @xmath0 decays and the angular distributions of the four lepton final state .",
    "we demonstrate that by studying three uni - angular distributions ( i.e.  _ distributions involving only one angle _ ) one can almost completely determine the spin and parity of @xmath4 and also explore any anomalous couplings in the most general fashion .",
    "we provide some experimental observables that can be tested to predict whether the resonance is a parity eigenstate or not irrespective of its spin .",
    "then we analyse the nuances of differences in the uni - angular distributions which we take into consideration for separating each of the spin , parity possibilities . for this",
    "we express our uni - angular distributions in terms of helicity amplitudes in the transversity basis which are very effective in their sensitivity to the parity of the parent particle .",
    "we find that the @xmath17 possibility can be easily distinguished from the @xmath18 possibilities since the uni - angular distributions for @xmath17 are completely predictable .",
    "nelson  @xcite and dellaquilla  @xcite realized the significance of studying angular correlations in such processes as higgs ( @xmath19 ) boson decaying to a pair of @xmath0 bosons for inferring the nature of the higgs boson .",
    "@xcite were first to extend the analysis to include higher spin possibilities .",
    "we study similar angular correlations in this paper to unambiguously determine the spin and parity of any new resonance decaying to four leptons via two @xmath0 boson .",
    "we begin the study by considering the most general @xmath20 vertices for @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath21 resonance @xmath4 .",
    "then we find out the effective lagrangians and uniangular distributions in terms of different observables for each spin possibilities and layout a procedure to identify them .",
    "we emphasize that the full angular distribution for the decay is described in terms of orthogonal function of sine and cosine of the angles involved in the decay . hence",
    ", no information is lost by considering uniangular distributions .",
    "decay of a resonance into two @xmath0 bosons which then decay into four leptons has been well studied in literature for different spin possibilities .",
    "for example refs .",
    "@xcite as well as refs .",

    "the aim of the current paper should not be confused with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , which dealt only with the @xmath22 higgs case .",
    "the current paper significantly improves upon the concepts presented in ref .",
    "@xcite by _ generalizing them to search for new resonances of arbitrary mass and arbitrary spin - parity using the gold - plated decay mode_. the analysis now includes the possibility of a spin-1 resonance which can also decay to two on - shell @xmath0 bosons , a case which was not dealt with earlier . ref .  @xcite does consider the spin-1 possibility . however , we emphasize that our analysis differs from this analysis as well , in many significant aspects",

    ".the benchmark values of the couplings @xmath206 and @xmath215 , for a spin-@xmath222 resonance of masses @xmath246 and @xmath236 respectively for our analysis .",
    "the values of corresponding decay widths @xmath200 are also tabulated in the last column for both the masses . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is easy to observe that when @xmath4 has spin-@xmath81 , then there are three helicity amplitudes and three partial wave contributions ( one @xmath247-wave , one @xmath47-wave and one @xmath248-wave ) .",
    "when @xmath4 has spin-@xmath83 , then there are only two independent helicity amplitudes and two partial wave contributions ( one @xmath47-wave and one @xmath248-wave ) .",
    "finally when @xmath4 has spin-@xmath82 , then there are six independent helicity amplitudes and six partial wave contributions ( one @xmath247-wave , one @xmath47-wave , two @xmath248-waves , one @xmath249-wave and one @xmath250-wave ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the spin-@xmath81 case the vertex factor has three form factors , for spin-@xmath83 case there are two form factors .",
    "however , for the spin-@xmath82 case we have eight form factors in the vertex factor instead of six .",
    "so one needs to consider only six form factors out of which four should be of parity - even nature and two should be of parity - odd nature . out of the four parity - odd form factors , only @xmath128 and",
    "@xmath129 contribute to the vertex factor as explained in [ sec : appendix - redundancy - in - spin-2-vertex ] .",
    "if we include the @xmath130 term in the vertex factor for spin-@xmath82 case , then only the two helicity amplitudes @xmath251 and @xmath252 get modified as follows : @xmath253 where the previous @xmath254 is now replaced by @xmath255 .",
    "note that only this combination of the two form factors would be accessible to any experiment .",
    "moreover , all other helicity amplitudes remain unchanged . in the vertex factor of eq .",
    "the term which is proportional to @xmath131 can be rewritten using schouten identity as follows : @xmath256 q_{1\\rho } q_{2\\sigma } \\nn\\\\ & \\quad   - \\frac{q^2}{4 } \\left ( \\epsilon^{\\alpha \\beta \\mu \\rho } \\ ; p_{\\rho } q^{\\nu } + \\epsilon^{\\alpha \\beta \\nu \\rho } \\ ; p_{\\rho } q^{\\mu } \\right ) \\nn\\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{p \\cdot q}{4 } \\left ( \\epsilon^{\\alpha \\beta \\mu \\sigma } \\ ; q^{\\nu } q_{\\sigma } + \\epsilon^{\\alpha \\beta \\nu \\sigma } \\ ; q^{\\mu } q_{\\sigma } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the form factor @xmath131 can be absorbed into the existing form factors @xmath129 and @xmath130 by redefining them as follows : @xmath257 the remaining contribution of @xmath131 is proportional to @xmath258 .",
    "since @xmath258 is not bose symmetric , this term does not contribute to our vertex factor .",
    "therefore the effect of including the @xmath130 and @xmath131 terms in the vertex factor can simply be taken care of by the following redefinitions of @xmath128 and @xmath129 as follows : @xmath259 since we can not have more than six helicity amplitudes for the spin-@xmath82 case , and we already have six form factors in the vertex factor , any additional form factor that we introduce in the vertex factor must come in association with the existing form factors , as proved here .",
    "the expressions for the coefficients @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 that entered the uni - angular distributions are given as follows : @xmath260 here @xmath261 is defined as @xmath262 with @xmath263 and @xmath264 . in the present case @xmath265 and @xmath266 . substituting the value @xmath267",
