    "addressing and manipulating an individual spin in a single quantum dot ( qd ) is a fundamental step to achieve for eventual information processing based on quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite neutral excitons can also be used as single qu - bits but their polarization properties have to be precisely known in order to address a specific state .",
    "it is well established now that for self - assembled quantum dots , in - plane shape anisotropy induced during growth leads to two linearly polarized orthogonal exciton states , splitted by the exciton fine structure splitting ( fss ) , @xcite having in principle the same oscillator strength .",
    "however , recent experimental observations show that the linear states are neither aligned along the crystallographic axes , nor orthogonal between them and an important linear polarization degree can be found .",
    "@xcite these facts strongly indicate that valence - band mixing ( vbm ) due to the anisotropic confinement potential and strain effects should be taken into account to explain the strong polarization anisotropy observed in the emission of individual qds , as well as the exciton eigenstates orientation .    indeed , in ii",
    "- vi cdte / znte @xcite or iii - v inalas / algaas @xcite qds , vbm has been related to the strain anisotropy induced during growth process . in strain - free gaas qds grown by droplet epitaxy it has been shown that vbm exists due to the anisotropy of the confinement potential , @xcite while in strained self - assembled inas / gaas qds , vbm effects have been investigated in order to estimate the exciton spin relaxation time , @xcite its influence on the exciton fss , @xcite or the hyperfine coupling .",
    "@xcite to our knowledge , no experimental study includes both strain effects and confinement anisotropy in order to explain the observed results , which can be fully described by combining the luttinger - kohn and the bir - pikus hamiltonians .",
    "@xcite    we report on polarization resolved micro - photoluminescence ( @xmath1 ) of the neutral exciton emission in single self - assembled inas / gaas qds .",
    "we investigate the role of vbm on polarization properties , due to confinement potential anisotropy and local strain effects described by a luttinger - kohn and bir - pikus hamiltonian .    since strain effects and dot shape",
    "anisotropy depend strongly on growth conditions they vary from sample to sample and from dot to dot .",
    "therefore , a large dispersion of values for the heavy to light - hole mixing parameters can be found in the literature .",
    "@xcite moreover , since morphological details and precise values for the different strain components can not be obtained at the same time for each studied qd by optical experiments , it is quite impossible to know precisely the origin of valence - band mixing .    nevertheless , from the study of polarization anisotropy on a very large statistical ensemble of individual qds ( about 300 dots on two different samples ) , we can conclude that : ( i ) the polarization anisotropy axis direction is dominated by strain - induced vbm , ( ii ) the polarization main axis is not aligned along the crystallographic axes but has a given direction within one probed micron , and ( iii ) the vbm strength can be large and can vary significantly from dot to dot in the same one probed micron .",
    "these results seem to indicate that if the polarization main axis is related to the in - plane main strain orientation,@xcite the mean components of the strain tensor are quite homogeneous for all dots inside a @xmath2 area",
    ". however the strength of the mixing seems to be mostly related to confinement anisotropy .    using an original experimental configuration where the qds layer is embedded in a one - dimensional waveguide , resonant emission of the neutral exciton in single qds could be analyzed and yield the two eigenstates oscillator strength ratio . using this geometry , polarization - resolved @xmath1 analyzed along the growth axis",
    "could also be recorded , revealing coupling between same - spin heavy and light hole states due to off - plane strain components . in conventional geometries this can not be evidenced and only in - plane strain components are usually taken into account . @xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give some details on the samples and the experimental configuration .",
    "section iii is devoted to the in - plane polarization  resolved @xmath1 experiments on single qds excited non - resonantly ( part a ) and resonantly ( part b ) . in parallel , simulations have been performed in order to give the general trends of the polarization properties influenced by mixing effects . in order to deduce the amplitude of the hh - lh coupling and the anisotropy axis of the polarization the experimental results are fitted taking into account the vbm . moreover ,",
    "an analysis of the eigenstates polarization misalignment with respect to the crystallographic axes is made .",
    "section iv presents the results of polarization resolved @xmath1 along the z - axis which allowed to evidence the shear strain components out of the growth plane .",
    "inas / gaas self - assembled qds , were grown by mbe on a planar @xmath3 $ ] gaas substrate . in order to address the fundamental exciton state at resonance ,",
    "the dots are embedded in a one - dimensional gaalas monomode waveguide ( wg ) .",
    "@xcite the wave - guiding geometry has several advantages : first , due to the spatial confinement of light , the volume of the optical mode is reduced and the coupling with the qds is enhanced .",
    "second , contrary to the microcavity case , there is no need to match the cavity mode energy with the qd emission energy in order to achieve a strong coupling between light and matter .",
    "finally , the laser light propagation axis can be perpendicular to the luminescence detection direction .",
    "indeed , while the laser propagates in the ( x , y ) dots plane , the single qd luminescence can be collected from the wg top surface by a confocal @xmath1 detection set - up ( see fig . [ expolar ] ) . since the laser beam is confined in the guided mode , the scattered light is greatly suppressed and the resonant luminescence is almost background - free , at low pump power",
    "using this geometrical configuration , resonant rabi oscillations of the exciton state in a single qd have been observed .",
    "@xcite coherent control experiments have also been performed in order to determine the main decoherence mechanisms in the system .",
    "@xcite moreover , in this geometry , it is also possible to excite a dot by the sample top surface and to detect the pl at the edge of the wg .",

    "the wl and the qds are represented as a red plane embedded in a waveguide formed by algaas/ gaas layers in blue and grey respectively .",
    "one micron ridges are etched on the sample surface to form the one - dimensional monomode optical guide.,width=264,height=151 ]    the qds are excited by ps pulses provided by a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser and focused on the sample using a microscope objective .",
    "the pl signal is then collected by another objective ( @xmath4 ) and detected with a 0.5 m grating spectrometer and a liquid - nitrogen - cooled charge - coupled device camera .",
    "all the objectives are mounted on piezo - electric actuators so they can easily control the coupling to the wg and move along the ridge to probe different qds .",
    "the spatial resolution of the set - up is diffraction - limited to @xmath2 , while its spectral resolution is about @xmath5 . in order to resolve the neutral exciton fss ,",
    "a fabry - perot interferometer , used as interferential filter can be inserted in the collection path , improving our spectral resolution to @xmath6 .",
    "then we were able to measure the exciton fss @xmath7 , which varies depending on the dot from 20 to 145 @xmath8 .",
    "the laser is polarized along @xmath9 $ ] and the sample is fixed on the cold finger of a three - axes optical cryostat ( 10k ) specifically designed for the wave - guiding geometry .",
    "two experimental configurations can be used for the polarization - resolved experiments : either the pump laser is guided and the @xmath1 is collected from the top surface of the wg , or the dot is excited from the top surface and its pl is collected at the edge of the wg . in both cases , the pl polarization is analyzed using a rotating half - wave plate ( hwp ) and a fixed linear polarizer , in order to avoid selection from the polarization response of the whole detection setup .",
    "in the case of qds with revolution symmetry around the growth direction z ( @xmath3 $ ] axis ) , the two neutral exciton bright eigenstates @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with a total angular momentum @xmath12 , are degenerated in energy and their emission is circularly polarized , left ( @xmath13 ) or right ( @xmath14 ) in the dots plane ( x , y ) .",
    "when the system symmetry is reduced , the electron - hole exchange interaction lifts this degeneracy and the two bright eigenstates are the two linear combinations @xcite @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whose emission is linearly polarized along the crystallographic axes [ 110 ] ( x - axis ) and [ 1@xmath170 ] ( y - axis ) . @xcite these two eigenstates are split in energy by the fss ( @xmath18 ) , and under non - resonant excitation the emission intensity of both states is the same , whatever the difference in oscillator strength .",
    "@xcite    if we now consider valence - band mixing ( vbm ) between heavy hole ( hh ) and light hole ( lh ) states which is due in general to in - plane shape asymmetry and anisotropic strain effects , the neutral exciton eigenstates become linear combinations of the elliptically - polarized bright exciton states @xmath19 , which can be written as : @xmath20 the first spin state corresponds to the electron spin projection , while the second corresponds to the heavy ( @xmath21 ) and light ( @xmath22 ) hole spin projection .",
    "the simulation adjustable parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the amplitude and phase of the mixing as defined in the luttinger - kohn and bir - pikus ( lkbp ) hamiltonian ( see appendix [ appendix2 ] ) .",
    "emission of these two states can then be elliptically polarized and their main axis can be tilted by an angle @xmath24 with respect to the y - axis [ 1@xmath170 ] .",
    "the two neutral exciton eigenstates are then : @xmath25 @xmath26 an additional angle @xmath27 ( see fig .",

    ", this angle can be different from the crystallographic axes and @xmath24 .",
    "depending on the lh ratio @xmath23 and the angle @xmath24 , the two eigenstates @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be tilted with respect to the crystallographic axes [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath170 ] , without being perpendicular anymore .",
    "the tilt angles are defined as @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively ( see fig [ phi ] ) and the angle between them is @xmath32 . in addition , under non - resonant excitation , because of the vbm , the two states have no longer the same emission intensity , resulting in the blue and red curves represented in fig [ phi ] .      by calculating the dipole matrix elements for the transitions between the @xmath33 conduction - band and the @xmath34 valence - band states ( see appendix [ appendix3 ] ) , the two eigenstates emission intensity , passing through a linear polarizer with an angle @xmath35 with respect to the x - axis [ 110 ] ( see fig .",

    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 polar diagrams give also the qd main axis orientation angle @xmath27 ( see fig . [ simu1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , as shown in ( [ int tot ] ) , the total intensity does not depend on @xmath27 and the parameter @xmath24 is given by the polar diagram orientation angle with respect to [ 1@xmath170 ] .",
    "@xmath23 is given by the contrast of the total pl polar diagram .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 polar diagrams can then be fitted to determine the unknown parameter @xmath27 .",
    "calculated polar diagrams in fig .",
    "[ simu1 ] show that when vbm occurs ( @xmath41 ) , the dot total emission is partially linearly polarized along a direction defined by @xmath24 , with a linear polarization degree @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , this parameter depends only on @xmath23 and can be expressed as : @xmath43    introducing , like in refs . . and .",
    "the reduced variable @xmath44 , the linear polarization degree takes the simpler form : @xmath45 . depending on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the polarization of @xmath28 ( blue curve ) and @xmath29 ( red curve )",
    "emission can be tilted with respect to the crystallographic axes by an angle @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "moreover , the vbm allows for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states not to be orthogonal .",
    "this is shown for instance in fig .",
    "[ simu1c],[simu1d ] and [ simu1h ] .",

    "the eigenstates tilting angles @xmath30 and @xmath31 only depend on the mixing parameters @xmath24 and @xmath23 but in a non - trivial way .",
    "the general tendency is that for a fixed value of @xmath23 , @xmath30 increases , reaches a maximum value , then decreases as a function of @xmath24 .",

    "now , let us consider the case @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ simu1 g ] and [ simu1h ] ) . for a given @xmath24 the presence of a small tilting of the dot changes the eigenstates orientation and thus the angle @xmath32 between them .",
    "for instance , we can see that for @xmath51 , the two eigenstates are perpendicular when @xmath52 ( @xmath53 , fig .",
    "[ simu1b ] ) , but when @xmath54 the angle is @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ simu1h ] ) .",
    "thus , it appears that @xmath32 does not depend only on @xmath24 and @xmath23 but depends also strongly on @xmath27 .",
    "polarization resolved @xmath1 measurements were performed on a very large statistical ensemble of individual qds .",
    "non resonant excitation energy has been used , typically in the absorption region of the wetting layer around 1.4 ev .",
    "[ cahuetpouet1 ] and [ cahuetpouet2 ] show two typical experimental polar diagrams of two different qds inside the same one @xmath56 detection spot .",
    "for these two particular dots , the same values for @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters were found ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) but the orientation angle @xmath27 was different ( @xmath49 and @xmath59 for ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .",
    "therefore , for a given total emission intensity ( purple curve ) it is not possible to determine the polarization direction of the two eigenstates ( red and blue curves ) . in a general manner",
    ", we observed that all the dots ( about 10 to 20 ) inside one @xmath56 detection spot have the same value of angle @xmath24 but the vbm amplitude @xmath23 is very different for each dot , ranging between 0 and 0.5 . in average , the mixing parameter is equal to 0.15 but with a large dispersion of @xmath60 ( see fig . [ histobeta ] ) .",
    "the @xmath24 angle can also vary significantly depending on the dot position along the wg axis .",
    "however the @xmath24 values are mainly concentrated around @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ histopsi ] ) .",
    "regarding the dots orientation axis @xmath27 , rather small angles have been found , less than @xmath63 and in most of the cases @xmath27 was smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "the fact that the angle @xmath24 is quite constant over a scale of one micron seems to indicate that @xmath24 is related mostly to the in - plane strain anisotropy which is the only parameter for which we can define a correlation length . as also described in ref . .",
    "@xmath24 is correlated to the main axis of the in - plane strain field , suggesting an homogeneous strain field inside the detection spot .",
    "the important variations found for @xmath23 on this same length scale indicate another physical origin having a strong influence on the mixing . indeed , the vbm amplitude is related both to the strain and confinement potential anisotropy in the case of sk qds .",
    "since the in - plane strain anisotropy seems to be rather uniform over this distance , then the confinement potential should govern the amplitude of vbm .",
    "the non - uniformity of chemical composition , @xcite the differences in shape and size of the dots @xcite can create important fluctuations of the confinement potential resulting in very dispersed values of the mixing parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the strong vbm combined to the small misorientation of the dots results in tilted eigenstates with respect to the crystallographic axes .",
    "tilt angles @xmath30 and @xmath31 reaching @xmath65 , as well as an angle @xmath32 ranging between @xmath66 and @xmath67 were found .",
    "it is also worth noticing that in the case of the two dots presented in fig .",
    "[ cahuetpouet1 ] and [ cahuetpouet2 ] , the @xmath23 parameter is the same but the emission wavelength and the fss are different . indeed , in a general manner we did not find any kind of correlation between the vbm amplitude and the emission wavelength or between the fss and vbm , contrary to what has been recently reported in ref .",
    "this disagreement might be due to the different confinement potential between the two kinds of samples , the emission energy of the dots being lower in energy in our case , suggesting a larger size .",
    "it is not also clear if the correlations reported in ref .",
    "are observed on a large area or in a very precise region on the sample .",
    "our experimental results were obtained over hundreds of dots on different areas on the sample surface .      in - plane pl polarization under resonant excitation has also been investigated to determine the oscillator strengths ratio @xmath68 between the two @xmath29 and @xmath28 eigenstates .",
    "although the excitation laser is linearly polarized along the y - direction , both eigenstates can be excited since they can be tilted with respect to the crystallographic axes .",
    "moreover the ps laser pulses are spectrally broader ( @xmath69 ) than the fss between the two eigenstates ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the pump power is kept low enough so the system is in the linear regime .",

    "[ rso2 ] shows a typical polar diagram of the total emission intensity of a qd .",

    "[ rso1 ] and [ rso3 ] show how the value of the ratio r can change the total intensity orientation although the off - resonance parameters are the same . if the eigenstates were aligned with respect to the crystallographic axes ( @xmath76 or @xmath67 and @xmath52 or @xmath67 ) , then only the @xmath77 state would be excited .",
    "the oscillator strengths ratio was found to range between 0.2 ( @xmath78 ) and 1.5 ( @xmath79 ) , but we noticed that in most cases , @xmath80 was larger than @xmath81",
    ". this ratio can be significantly different from the ratio between the two eigenstates emission intensity found in off - resonance measurements .",
    "this fact confirms that in non resonant experiments the emission intensity is not proportional to the oscillator strength.@xcite    finally , knowing the eigenstates polarization and oscillator strengths ratio for a given qd will allow addressing a particular state with the proper polarization and having a large oscillator strength .",
    "this will enhance the possibilities of coherent manipulations of an excitonic qu - bit .",
    "the in - plane pl polar diagrams under resonant excitation can also allow to distinguish between the neutral exciton ( linearly polarized ) and the charged exciton ( elliptically polarized ) .",
    "this can be useful in non - resonant experiments , because if the fss can not be resolved both neutral and charged exciton lines appear to be elliptically polarized .",
    "the original geometry of our set - up allows us , by exciting from the top surface and detecting the pl from the edge of the wg , to study the polarization properties along the z - axis , which is impossible in usual backscattering excitation - detection geometry .",
    "@xcite observation of pl with a polarization component along the z - axis in few dots , has led us to consider a mixing between heavy and light hole states with the same spins due to the different off - plane shear strain components which are usually neglected in the lkbp hamiltonian .",

[ zbis ] ) show that the presence of @xmath83 changes neither the total emission intensity contrast ( thus not changing @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , nor the two eigenstates emission intensity orientation , therefore not changing @xmath27 . only the normalization constants are slightly modified",

    "[ zter ] the polarization rates @xmath85 as a function of the mixing parameter @xmath23 , for @xmath86 ( red curve ) and @xmath87 ( black curve ) . for the typical mixing strength we observed ( @xmath88 ) ,",
    "@xmath89 is almost the same in both cases .",
    "we can also notice that @xmath89 increases linearly until @xmath90 and then decreases very fast .",

    "in summary , the polarization - resolved @xmath1 experiments performed on single self - assembled inas / gaas qds have allowed to determine the influence of the vbm on the polarization properties of the exciton eigenstates .",

    "this property is clearly related to shear components of the deformation tensor out of the growth plane .",
    "we did not find any relationship between the strength of the mixing or the tilt of the eigenstates polarization axis and the emission energy of the exciton .",
