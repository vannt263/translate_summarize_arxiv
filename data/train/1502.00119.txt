    "<S> we calculate the branching ratio for the production of the meson @xmath0 in the decay @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we use qcd sum rules approach and we consider the @xmath0 to be a mixture between charmonium and exotic tetraquark , @xmath2[qc]$ ] , states with @xmath3 . using the value of the mixing angle determined previously as : @xmath4 , we get the branching ratio @xmath5 , which allows us to estimate an interval on the branching fraction @xmath6 in agreement with the experimental upper limit reported by babar collaboration .    the @xmath0 state was first observed by babar collaboration in the @xmath7 annihilation through initial state radiation @xcite , and it was confirmed by cleo and belle collaborations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 was also observed in the @xmath8 decay @xcite , and cleo reported two additional decay channels : @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 is one of the many charmonium - like state , called @xmath11 and @xmath12 states , recently observed in @xmath7 collisions by babar and belle collaborations that do not fit the quarkonia interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the production mechanism , masses , decay widths , spin - parity assignments and decay modes of these states have been discussed in some reviews @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 is particularly interesting because some new states have been identified in the decay channels of the @xmath0 , like the @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 was first observed by the besiii collaboration in the @xmath14 mass spectrum of the @xmath15 decay channel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this structure , was also observed at the same time by the belle collaboration @xcite and was confirmed by the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using cleo - c data .    </S>",
    "<S> the decay modes of the @xmath0 into @xmath16 and other charmonium states indicate the existence of a @xmath17 in its content . </S>",
    "<S> however , the attempts to classify this state in the charmonium spectrum have failed since the @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 states have been assigned to the well established @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons respectively , and the prediction from quark models for the @xmath23 state is 4.52 gev . therefore , the mass of the @xmath0 is not consistent with any of the @xmath24 @xmath20 states @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> some theoretical interpretations for the @xmath0 are : tetraquark state @xcite , hadronic @xmath25 , @xmath26 molecule @xcite , @xmath27 molecule @xcite , @xmath28 molecule @xcite , @xmath29 molecule @xcite , a hybrid charmonium @xcite , a charm - baryonium @xcite , a cusp @xcite , etc . within the available experimental information , none of these suggestions can be completely ruled out . however , there are some calculations , within the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) approach @xcite , that can not explain the mass of the @xmath0 supposing it to be a tetraquark state @xcite , or a @xmath25 , @xmath26 hadronic molecule @xcite , or a @xmath29 molecular state @xcite .    in the framework of the qcdsr </S>",
    "<S> the mass and the decay width , in the channel @xmath30 , of the @xmath0 were computed with good agreement with data , considering it as a mixing between two and four - quark states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing is done at the level of the hadronic currents and , physically , this corresponds to a fluctuation of the @xmath31 state where a gluon is emitted and subsequently splits into a light quark - antiquark pair , which lives for some time and behaves like a tetraquark - like state . </S>",
    "<S> the same approach was applied to the @xmath32 state and good agreement with the data were obtained for its mass and the decay width into @xmath30 @xcite , its radiative decay @xcite , and also in the @xmath32 production rate in @xmath33 decay @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the production of the @xmath0 , using the mixed two - quark and four - quark prescription of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath42 meson as a mixed state of tetraquark and charmonium interacts via @xmath17 component of the weak current . </S>",
    "<S> in effective theory , at the scale @xmath43 , the weak decay is treated as a four - quark local interaction described by the effective hamiltonian ( see fig .

    "<S> the form factors @xmath58 describe the weak transition @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can see that the factorization of the matrix element describes the decay as two separated sub - processes .    </S>",

    "<S> the invariant amplitude squared can be obtained from ( [ amp ] ) , using ( [ 2pmatrix ] ) and ( [ 3pmatrix ] ) : @xmath62    the coupling constant @xmath63 was determined in ref.@xcite through extrapolation of the form factor @xmath64 to the meson pole @xmath65 , using the qcdsr approach for the three - point correlator @xcite : _ </S>",

    "<S> we perform a borel transform to @xmath86 to improve the matching between both sides of the sum rules . after performing the borel transform in both sides of the sum rule we get in the @xmath87 structure : @xmath88 where the invariant functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 are written in terms of a dispersion relation , @xmath91 with their respective spectral densities @xmath92 and @xmath93 given in appendix .    </S>",

    "<S> taking into account the variation in the borel mass parameter , in the continuum threshold , in the quark condensate , in the coupling constant @xmath83 and in the mixing angle @xmath76 , the result for the @xmath56 parameter is : @xmath98 thus we can calculate the decay width in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the branching ratio is evaluated dividing the result by the total width of the @xmath33 meson @xmath100 : @xmath101 where we have used the ckm parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 @xcite , and the wilson coefficients @xmath104 , @xmath105 , computed at @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xcite .     as a function of @xmath96 , for different values of the continuum threshold.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to compare the branching ratio in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result ] ) with the branching fraction obtained experimentally in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ branching ] ) , we might use the results found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath108 and then , considering the uncertainties , we can estimate @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is important to notice that the authors in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have considered two pions in the final state coming only from intermediate states , e.g. @xmath110 and @xmath111 mesons , which could indicate that the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bry ] ) can be underestimated . in this sense , considering that the main decay channel observed for the @xmath0 state is into @xmath112 , we would naively expect that the branching ratio into this channel could also be @xmath113 , which would lead to the following result , @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we obtain an interval on the branching fraction @xmath115 which is in agreement with the experimental upper limit reported by babar collaboration given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ branching ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in general the experimental evaluation of the branching fraction takes into account additional factors related to the numbers of reconstructed events for the final state ( @xmath116 ) , for the reference process ( @xmath117 ) , and for the respective reconstruction efficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> however , since such information has not been provided in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we have neglected these factors in the calculation of the branching fraction @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the comparison of our result with the experimental result could be affected by these differences .    in conclusion , we have used the qcdsr approach to evaluate the production of the @xmath0 state , considered as a mixed charmonium - tetraquark state , in the decay @xmath119 . using the factorization hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the sum rules result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result ] ) , is compatible with the experimental upper limit . </S>",
    "<S> our result can be interpreted as a lower limit for the branching ratio , since we did not considered the non - factorizable contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> our result was obtained by considering the mixing angle in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jmix ] ) in the range @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this angle was determined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the mass and the decay width of the @xmath0 in the channel @xmath120 were determined in agreement with experimental values . therefore , since there is no new free parameter in the present analysis , the result presented here strengthens the conclusion reached in @xcite that the @xmath0 is probably a mixture between a @xmath20 state and a tetraquark state .    as discussed in @xcite , it is not simple to determine the charmonium and the tetraquark contribution to the state described by the current in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jmix ] ) . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jmix ] ) one can see that , besides the @xmath121 , the @xmath20 component of the current is multiplied by a dimensional parameter , the quark condensate , in order to have the same dimension of the tetraquark part of the current . therefore , it is not clear that only the angle in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jmix ] ) determines the percentage of each component . </S>",
    "<S> one possible way to evaluate the importance of each part of the current it is to analyze what one would get for the production rate with each component , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , using @xmath122 and @xmath123 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jmix ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> doing this we get respectively for the pure tetraquark and pure charmonium : @xmath124 comparing the results for the pure states with the one for the mixed state ( [ result ] ) , we can see that the branching ratio for the pure tetraquark is one order smaller , while the pure charmonium is larger . from these results </S>",
    "<S> we see that the @xmath20 part of the state plays a very important role in the determination of the branching ratio . on the other hand , in the decay @xmath125 , the width obtained in our approach for a pure @xmath20 state is @xcite : @xmath126 and </S>",
    "<S> , therefore , the tetraquark part of the state is the only one that contributes to this decay , playing an essential role in the determination of this decay width .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although we can not determine the percentages of the @xmath20 and the tetraquark components in the @xmath0 , we may say that both components are extremely important , and that , in our approach , it is not possible to explain all the experimental data about the @xmath0 with only one component . </S>"
