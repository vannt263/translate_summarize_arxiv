    "the study of wave scattering in black hole spacetimes is crucial to the understanding of the signals expected to be received by the new generation of gravitational - wave detectors in the near future@xcite .",
    "since the linear perturbations of black holes are represented by fields of integral spins , the study of the scattering of wave fields are concentrated on these cases while that of the dirac fields are thus less common , especially for the massive ones@xcite .",
    "the neutrino does not respond directly to electric or magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , if one wishes to influence its orbit by forces subject to simple analysis , one has to make use of gravitational fields . in other words",
    ", one has to consider the physics of a neutrino in a curved metric .",
    "there are both numerical and analytical methods in solving the various wave equations in black hole scattering@xcite .",
    "other approximated solutions can be obtained using the semi - analytic wkb approximation@xcite , which has been proven to be very useful and accurate in many cases like , for example , the evaluation of the quasi normal mode frequencies@xcite .",
    "quasi normal modes frequencies has been obtained using approximated analytical solutions with susy for massless neutrinos@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the extension of 4d spacetime to @xmath0 manifolds is the preferred route to a unification of the interactions of particle physics with gravity .",
    "the two approaches to 5d relativity of most current interest are brane theory and induced matter theory , which are mathematically equivalent@xcite .",
    "the former commonly uses the warp metric in 5d , and in general leads to an extra force on a massive particle in 4d@xcite , where however the particle can travel on a null path in 5d@xcite .",
    "similar results were found previously for induced - matter theory , which commonly uses the canonical metric in 5d to isolate the fifth force@xcite and examine null geodesics in 5d@xcite .",
    "these investigations are classical in nature , but clearly invite an examination of the corresponding picture in quantum theory . in a more recent work was examined the 4d klein - gordon and dirac equation from 5d null paths@xcite .    in this letter",
    "we shall study the 4d dirac equation for neutral @xmath1-spin fermions with mass ( neutrinos ) which are close to a non - rotating sds black hole , but using a extended sds , which describes a 5d vacuum on a 5d ricci - flat metric .",
    "we shall consider that the space - like extra coordinate is noncompact .",
    "we shall consider the 5d ricci - flat ( @xmath2 and then the ricci scalar @xmath3 ) metric @xmath4 , given by the line element@xcite @xmath5+d\\psi^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 $ ] is a dimensionless function , @xmath7 are the usual local spacetime spherical coordinates employed in general relativity and @xmath8 is the noncompact space - like extra dimension .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 and @xmath9 have length units , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are angular coordinates , @xmath12 is a time - like coordinate , @xmath13 denotes the speed of light , @xmath14 is an arbitrary constant with length units and the constant parameter @xmath15 has units of @xmath16 .",
    "we are concerned with a 5d spacetime as a main bundle and @xmath17 its structural group . einstein s",
    "4d spacetime is the usual base of this bundle , so , physical fields will not depend on the extra coordinate .      to define a 5d vacuum we shall consider a lagrangian for a massless 5d spinor field",

    "the solution for the equation ( [ sep ] ) is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant of integration . on the other hand , for @xmath54",
    "the function @xmath49 tends to @xmath55 for @xmath56 , but is divergent for @xmath57 . in order to the function @xmath49 to be real",
    ", we must ask @xmath58 take integer unbounded values : @xmath59 .",
    "it appears to be a form of quantization . in the figure ( [ figura1 ] ) we have plotted @xmath49 for different values of @xmath58 .",
    "notice that for even @xmath60 values the function @xmath49 is even but for odd @xmath60 values the function is also odd .",
    "finally , one could distinguish between two different cases .",
    "* i ) * for ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) or ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , one obtains @xmath65 . *",
    "ii ) * for ( @xmath61 and @xmath64 ) or ( @xmath63 and @xmath62 ) , the mass is negative : @xmath66 . the last case is a nonsense result in 4d physics and therefore should be discarded .",
    "now let us to assume that the 5d spacetime can be foliated by the family of hypersurfaces @xmath67 . on every generic hypersurface @xmath68 the induced metric",
    "is given by the 4d line element @xmath69 which describes a schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime with an equation of state @xmath70 .",
    "if we assume a static foliation of the 5d spacetime on the 4d hypersurface @xmath71 , the 4d energy momentum tensor will be described by a perfect fluid @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are respectively the energy density and pressure of the induced matter .",
    "furthermore , the 4-velocities @xmath75 are related to the 5-velocities @xmath76 by @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the components of the tensor metric in ( [ a2 ] ) . from the relativistic point of view",
    ", observers that are on @xmath71 move with @xmath79 . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the campbell - magaard theorem@xcite serves as a ladder to go between manifolds whose dimensionality differs by one .",
    "this theorem , which is valid in any number of dimensions , implies that every solution of the 4d einstein equations with arbitrary energy momentum tensor can be embedded , at least locally , in a solution of the 5d einstein field equations in vacuum . because of this",
    ", the tensor @xmath80 is induced as a 4d manifestation of the embedding geometry .",
    "the einstein field equations on @xmath81 for the metric in ( [ a2 ] ) , read @xmath82 the resulting equation of state is @xmath83 which is the equation of state for a vacuum dominated by the cosmological constant @xmath84 , which has been induced from the extra space - like dimension .    if we take a constant foliation @xmath85 [ to avoid a possible divergence of @xmath86 on the metric ( [ a1 ] ) we obtain the metric([a2 ] ) , such that the effective 4d dirac equation is given by @xmath87^{1/4}}{r } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left [ r [ f(r)]^{1/4 } \\bar{\\psi}\\right ] - \\frac{\\gamma^r}{r } \\left ( \\vec{\\sigma } . \\vec{l } + \\mathbb{i}\\right ) \\bar{\\psi } + \\gamma^4   m \\bar{\\psi}=0 , \\label{dirac4d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 should be real ( @xmath90 ) , for any @xmath91 .",
    "as a consequence of this result we obtained a quantized mass @xmath92 .",
    "this is an important result that shows how the mass @xmath92 of the neutrinos , which are close of a background 4d sds metric , can be induced from a free massless 5d test spinors close to a ricci - flat metric in 5d .",
    "finally , numerical solutions for this equation were obtained in @xcite .",
    "we have studied a formalism to describe 4d massive neutrinos which are near a sds black hole , from a 5d ricci - flat extended sds metric . on this metric",
    "we define a vacuum and hence the spinors are considered as test massless non - interacting fermion fields .",
    "physically , the background metric here employed describes a 5d extension of an usual sds static spacetime .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath80 can be induced in 4d as a manifestation of the embedded geometry , once we use the campbell - magaard theorem .",
    "this theorem is valid in any number of dimensions and implies that every solution of the 4d einstein equations with arbitrary energy momentum tensor can be embedded , at least locally , in a solution of the 5d einstein field equations in vacuum ( i.e. , at least ricci - flat ) .    of course ,",
    "this result could be extended to many other applications , as the study of primordial neutrinos in the early universe .",
    "this issue will be the subject of future research .",
    "moreover , according to the recent experimental data@xcite , the study of some possible consequences for the existence of overlighting neutrinos in the inflationary universe deserves a careful study .",
