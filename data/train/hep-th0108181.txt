    "the iib matrix model @xcite is the zero volume limit @xcite of a ten - dimensional super yang - mills theory , which is expected to be a non - perturbative formulation of superstring theory .",
    "the gauge fields in the iib matrix model are represented by @xmath2 hermitian matrices .",
    "the distribution of eigenvalues of those matrices is interpreted as our space - time .",
    "then , how the iib matrix model settles the space - time structure , e.g. , space - time dimension , is one of the most important problems .",
    "we need to search for the true vacuum of the iib matrix model to solve the above problem .",
    "when @xmath3 , we can actually integrate the fermions and investigate analytically the model with the bosonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "however , it is almost impossible to follow the same procedure when @xmath4 .",
    "so we should take other ways to analyze the iib matrix model .",
    "it is natural to think that the iib matrix model in the large-@xmath0 limit is described by a field theory because it has infinite numbers of degrees of freedom .",
    "we expect that we may be able to determine the true vacuum of the iib matrix model with the techniques of field theories if we could find such a field theory .",
    "we have paid attention to the fact that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the action of an @xmath2 matrix model and that of the field theory on a non - commutative periodic lattice ( ncpl ) with @xmath2 sites , which we denote as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "since the commutation relations of coordinates on ncpl are proportional to @xmath6 , one may think that the matrix model in the large-@xmath0 limit has a one - to - one correspondence to a field theory on the continuous torus .",
    "since the action of a naive large-@xmath0 limit of the iib matrix model is the supersymmetric schild action on a torus @xcite , it is believed that the finite-@xmath0 iib matrix model is a regularized supersymmetric schild model @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the supersymmetric schild model on a torus is a plausible candidate for the large-@xmath0 limit of the iib matrix model .",
    "however , we pointed out a possibility that the large-@xmath0 behavior of the iib matrix model and that of the supersymmetric schild model with the momentum cut - off are different @xcite . and the differences between the bosonic matrix model and the lattice - regularized schild model were discussed in @xcite . in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we proposed a method to estimate the large-@xmath0 dependences of correlation functions of the iib matrix model kinematically .",
    "we also applied this method to the supersymmetric schild model with the momentum cut - off and found that it has a different large-@xmath0 dependence from the iib matrix model because its action has a different overall factor of @xmath0 .    in this paper , we confirm our conjecture by calculating correlation functions using monte carlo simulation .",
    "as for the bosonic matrix model , our monte carlo results are , of course , consistent with those in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also calculate some correlation functions in two kinds of regularized schild model , one of which uses the lattice regularization and the other introduces a naive momentum cut - off .",
    "we find that the bosonic matrix model and both of the regularized schild model have different large-@xmath0 dependences .",
    "comparison between the large-@xmath0 dependences of the bosonic matrix model and those of the lattice regularized schild model were studied before in ref.@xcite and our results are consistent with theirs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we show the numerical results by the monte carlo simulation of the bosonic matrix model and in section 3 , we consider the regularized schild models and present the results by the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we proposed a method to estimate the large-@xmath0 dependences of correlation functions of the iib matrix model kinematically . here",
    "we restrict our discussions on the bosonic part of the iib matrix model .",
    "the action of the bosonic matrix model is given by @xmath7 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 are @xmath2 hermitian matrices and @xmath9 in this case our kinematical study leads to the result that any correlation functions behave as @xmath10 when @xmath0 goes to infinity keeping @xmath1 fixed .",
    "this is the same statement as thooft argued perturbatively @xcite and it was shown perturbatively in ref.@xcite , while we do not use any perturbative arguments but only kinematical naive counting .",
    "we should note that the naive counting does not lead to eq.([eqn : conjecture ] ) with the usual matrix forms .",
    "for example , when we calculate the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath11 naively , we find @xmath12 since the summation is over @xmath13 terms .",
    "in general , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a polynomial of degree @xmath16 .",
    "the situation is changed , however , when we map the iib matrix model to the field theory on ncpl @xcite .",
    "we can rewrite any matrix models to field theories on ncpl because the commutation relations of the plain waves on ncpl coincide with u(n ) algebra @xcite .",
    "correlation functions are rewritten by @xmath17 where @xmath18 has the same functional form as @xmath19 but the products of the arguments are replaced by the star products on ncpl , @xmath20 are @xmath21 points on ncpl , and hence eq.([eqn : ncplcorfun ] ) is at most @xmath22 because the summation over @xmath20 is the summation over @xmath21 points .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have calculated correlation functions of the bosonic matrix model and two sorts of regularized schild model by monte carlo methods to investigate the large-@xmath0 limits of those models .",
    "we have the following two conclusions : + ( i ) the monte carlo results of the bosonic matrix model strongly supports eq.([eqn : conjecture ] ) , which says that any correlation functions such as @xmath23 is at most @xmath22 when @xmath0 goes to infinity with @xmath1 fixed to some constant .",
    "+ ( ii ) the @xmath0 dependences of correlation functions of the bosonic matrix model do not agree with neither of those of regularized schild models .",
    "let us consider the first statement .",
    "we see that the upper bound of the @xmath0 dependences of the correlation functions can be calculated by naive counting .",
    "in fact , there are some ways to count @xmath0 dependence naively and the strongest constraint is eq.([eqn : conjecture ] ) .",
    "let us demonstrate it with @xmath24 as an example .",
    "we have at least three different ways to express it by components of matrices as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 the r.h.s .  of eq.([eqn :",
    "a4matrix ] ) is a usual matrix representation , eq.([eqn : a4ncpl ] ) is the coordinate one on ncpl and eq.([eqn : a4momentum ] ) is its momentum one .",
    "the @xmath0 dependences by naive counting are at most @xmath27 , @xmath22 , and @xmath28 , respectively . in general , the upper bound of @xmath0 dependences of @xmath29 by naive counting are given by @xmath30 , @xmath22 , and @xmath31 from the matrix representation , the ncpl coordinate one , and its momentum one , respectively .",
    "the ncpl coordinate description , eq.([eqn : a4ncpl ] ) , gives the strongest constraint on the upper bound of large-@xmath0 dependence and they agree with eq.([eqn : conjecture ] ) .",
    "we did not take a perturbative approach @xcite but only the kinematical one , and we expect that our arguments are applicable to the supersymmetric one @xcite .",
    "next let us discuss the second statement .",
    "we should notice that the distributions of the eigenvalues , @xmath32 , diverge logarithmically in the regularized schild models , while it will be a constant in the large-@xmath0 limit of the bosonic matrix model . in the iib matrix model , @xmath33 , which is expected to be @xmath34 ,",
    "is interpreted as the extent of the universe , while the fixed @xmath1 will be proportional to @xmath35 @xcite , so that the origin of the huge ratio should be explained . on the other hand ,",
    "if the extent of the universe diverges as in the regularized schild model , or we may fix @xmath36 @xcite in the bosonic matrix model , there would be no problem of the huge ratio . from this point of view , it is important to consider the possibility that whether one can build the string theory from the supersymmetric schild model instead of the iib matrix model as in ref.@xcite .",
