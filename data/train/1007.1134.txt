    "in the past decade , semiconductor spintronics , with the aim of realizing favourable devices for future application based on the spin degree of freedom , has attracted much attention.@xcite one of the most critical challenges for such devices lies in the control of the spin lifetime , which is limited by the unavoidable spin relaxation and/or dephasing process in semiconductors . in this",
    "sense , understanding of the carrier spin relaxations and/or dephasings is a critical issue.@xcite in bulk materials , the spin relaxation and/or dephasing properties of the electrons and the underlying physics have been well understood after a long - time research.@xcite however , the study on hole spin dynamics , which occurs on the time scale of the momentum scattering time ( usually @xmath1  ps ) , is fairly rare , partly because of the limited resolution on the detection of such an ultrafast process . to our best knowledge",
    ", the hole spin lifetime in bulk semiconductors was only measured in intrinsic gaas at room temperature , which evaluated the spin relaxation time of the heavy hole ( @xmath2  fs).@xcite    one picture to explain the picosecond hole spin relaxation ( hsr ) time is the dyakonov - perel-like description associated with the momentum scattering and the spin precession between the light - hole ( lh ) and heavy - hole ( hh).@xcite however , this picture works only if the broadening of the energy spectrum due to scattering is larger than the _ interband _ splitting , corresponding to the vicinity of the zone center .",
    "otherwise , holes are driven to large momentum states where the degeneracy between the lh and hh bands is significantly lifted , hence it is more appropriate to treat the lh and hh bands separately .",
    "the hsr of the individual lh and hh bands was studied by yu _",
    "et al._,@xcite who obtained the accurate band structure from the tight - binding hamiltonian with the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and calculated the spin relaxation time of the lh ( hh ) as the inversion of the decay rate of the quasi - spin polarization , that is , the population difference of the lh ( hh ) between the two quasi - spin bands .",
    "the elliott - yafet ( ey ) mechanism,@xcite there described as the direct quasi - spin - flip scattering , was claimed to be the solo mechanism for the hh and the dominant one for the lh , while the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism@xcite treated as the intraband precession together with the quasi - spin - conserving scattering from the motional narrowing relation was found to be unimportant . since the calculation was based on the single particle theory , the coulomb interaction which has been demonstrated to result in intriguing many - body effects during electron spin dynamics@xcite",
    "was missed in that work . moreover ,",
    "the hsr time was extracted from the quasi - spin polarization instead of the exact spin signal .",
    "the feasibility of this approach needs to be verified . in other words , the results obtained",
    "there is not exactly the hsr time , but the quasi - spin relaxation time .",
    "recently , the hole spin dynamics in intrinsic bulk gaas with the coulomb interaction was microscopically investigated from an eight - band kane hamiltonian by krau _",
    "et al._,@xcite where the hsr time , directly from the decay of the hole spin expectation , was shown to be quite close to the experimental result .",
    "it was also shown that the hsr time can be slightly different from the quasi - spin relaxation time .",
    "thus , it seems that ultrafast hsr in bulk zinc - blende semiconductors has been successfully interpreted theoretically .",
    "however , one may notice that the _ intraband _ coherence , i.e. , the non - diagonal components of the density matrices was missing in that work , which actually will lead to two consequences : the exaggeration of the ey mechanism and the exclusion of the dp mechanism .",
    "moreover , the nonpolar interaction of holes with transverse- and longitudinal - optical - phonons due to the deformation potential coupling , which was shown to produce a significant contribution on the charge dynamics of holes,@xcite was not included . in this sense , the results in ref .",
    "should be reexamined .    in the present work ,",
    "we employ the fully microscopic kinetic spin bloch equations ( ksbes)@xcite to investigate the hsr due to the ey and dp mechanisms in intrinsic and @xmath0-type bulk gaas .",
    "the ey mechanism here corresponds to the decay of the spin polarization solely due to the scattering associated with the interband mixing , between not only the hh and lh bands but also the conduction and valence bands ; whereas the dp mechanism stands for the additional contribution by including the intraband spin precessions .",
    "we first analytically derive the valence band structure from the four - band luttinger hamiltonian@xcite together with the dresselhaus soc ( ref . ) due to the bulk inversion asymmetry in zinc - blende semiconductors .",
    "we demonstrate that the dresselhaus soc induces an intraband splitting between the two hh bands as well as the two lh bands with cubic wave - vector dependence , which supplies an additional hsr channel due to the dp mechanism .",
    "we find that the intraband splitting of the hh bands vanishes under the spherical approximation of the luttinger hamiltonian , and then the dp mechanism becomes irrelevant to the hh spin relaxation.@xcite this implies the limitation of such an approximation in calculating the hsr time .",
    "therefore , we later obtain the intraband splitting and wave functions by diagonalizing the full eight - band @xmath3 hamiltonian _ beyond _ the spherical approximation . then we calculate the hsr time from the ksbes with the _ intraband _ coherence and all the relevant scatterings , such as the hole - impurity , hole - hole , hole - electron , hole - acoustic - phonon , polar and nonpolar hole - optical - phonon scatterings , explicitly included . in the intrinsic case at room temperature ,",
    "the hsr is dominated by the ey mechanism and the hsr time shows good agreement with the experiment .",
    "we find that the hsr time can be significantly manipulated by changing the temperature and excitation density . in the @xmath0-type materials ,",
    "we predict intriguing nonmonotonic behaviors of the hsr time in both the density and temperature dependences .",
    "we show that the nonmonotonic features reflect the role of the screening .",
    "moreover , we find that the ey mechanism is usually the major mechanism of the hsr , but the dp mechanism can still be comparable with the ey mechanism in some special cases , such as the high density regime at low temperature and the low density regime at moderate temperature .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we set up our model and derive the effective dresselhaus field from the luttinger hamiltonian .",
    "the ksbes are also constructed in this section . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the hsr in both intrinsic and @xmath0-type gaas . the comparison of the calculations with and without the intraband coherence is given in this section to illustrate the role of the intraband coherence .",
    "the relative contributions of the dp and ey mechanisms are also discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize in sec .  iv .",
    "to qualitatively analyze the band structure and the intraband splitting of the hh and lh bands , we start from the perturbation method with the @xmath4 hamiltonian ( in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath5 with eigenvalues @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , in sequence ) near the center of the brillouin - zone @xmath10 the first term on the right - hand side of the equation is the luttinger hamiltonian,@xcite where @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 $ ] .",

    "the wave functions can be expressed by @xmath21    by identifying @xmath22 and @xmath23 as pseudo - spin - up and -down states separately , one obtains the effective magnetic field of the dresselhaus soc ( @xmath24 ) between them .",
    "specifically , one rewrites @xmath25 in the representation of @xmath26 , and derives individual hh and lh blocks from the lwdin partitioning method@xcite upto the cubic power of the wave vector , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the expressions of the effective magnetic field together with the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given in appendix[appen ] .",
    "the presence of the intraband splitting @xmath32 obviously indicates that the dp mechanism can contribute to the hsr in the presence of the scatterings.@xcite interestingly , one finds @xmath33 vanishes once the spherical approximation ( corresponding to @xmath34)@xcite is applied , which means that the contribution of the dp mechanism to the hh spin relaxation is lost within the spherical approximation scheme . in other words ,",
    "the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , arising from the remote bands,@xcite is important in counting the hh spin relaxation .",
    "we should point out that the above perturbation approach gives the precise value of the intraband splitting only in the vicinity of the zone - center .",
    "for the regime far away from the center , the modification from the split - off and conduction bands should be considered .",
    "therefore , the intraband splittings @xmath37 are obtained from the diagonalization of the @xmath38 kane hamiltonian @xmath39 ( ref . ) in our numerical calculation , that is , by solving the schrdinger equation @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",

    "which clearly shows the problem of the missing of the intraband coherence .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the spin - conserving scattering becomes the spin - flip one once the non - diagonal elements of the density matrices in helix representation are neglected.@xcite in ref . , the authors argued the disregarding of the intraband coherence by arguing that the optically driven coherence between single particle states would be very small and the soc could not drive any coherence further during the time evolution of the density matrices in the helix representation ( i.e. , under the basis called `` intelligent basis '' there ) .",
    "however , this is actually incorrect .",
    "since the soc information is transferred into the wave functions of the eigenstates in the helix representation , any spin - conserving scattering events can induce the intraband and/or interband coherence.@xcite therefore , the same hsr time is obtained if one chooses the helix initial condition , corresponding to the initialization without any non - diagonal elements of the density matrices at @xmath100 . in the remaining part of this paper",
    ", all the results are obtained from the calculation including the intraband coherence .",
    "the green curves ( labelled as `` without nphop '' ) in fig.[fig2 ] obtained from the calculation without the nonpolar hole - optical - phonon scattering give the hsr time around 0.17  ps , much longer than that from the full calculation .",
    "this clearly shows the importance of the nonpolar hole - optical - phonon scattering in the hsr .",
    "it is noted that this scattering is also missed in ref .. for comparison , we further plot the spin polarization from the calculation without the nonpolar hole - optical - phonon scattering and the intraband coherence as black dotted curve , which corresponds to the calculation scheme in ref .. it is seen that the missed terms have marked contribution to the hsr .    since the direct relation between the ey mechanism and the scattering strength , the hsr time due to the ey mechanism decreases ( increases ) when the scattering becomes stronger ( weaker ) . to show the influence of the scattering more clearly",
    ", we vary the density and temperature . the density dependence of the hsr time is plotted in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "one can see that the hsr time at room temperature monotonically decreases with increasing photo - excitation density .",
    "since the electrons and holes are both in the nondegenerate regime , the coulomb scattering rate becomes larger as the density increases , according to the estimation of the average coulomb scattering rate @xmath108.@xcite as a result , the hsr time decreases .",
    "one can also see that the hsr time markedly increases with decreasing temperature , due to the suppression of the hole - phonon scattering .",
    "more interestingly , we predict a valley in the density dependence of the hsr time at low temperature .",
    "the minimum occurs at @xmath109  @xmath77 ( corresponding to the fermi temperatures @xmath110  k for electrons and @xmath111  k for holes ) at @xmath112  k and @xmath113  @xmath77 ( @xmath114  k and @xmath115  k ) at @xmath116  k. the agreement between @xmath117 at the valley and the lattice temperature @xmath118 reveals that the valley results from the different density dependence of the hole - electron scattering in the degenerate and nondegenerate limits . as mentioned above , the hsr time decreases with increasing density in the nondegenerate limit .",
    "however , for high densities , electrons first enter into the degenerate regime .",
    "therefore the hole - electron scattering strength is significantly decreased due to the pauli - blocking of electrons . as a result , the hsr time due to the ey mechanism increases in this regime , and finally results in the valley at the crossover between the degenerate and nondegenerate regimes of electrons . in the figure , we also plot the result from the calculation without the hole - electron scattering at 50  k. it is clear to see that the valley at @xmath109  @xmath77 disappears , as expected .",
    "instead , one finds that another valley shows up at @xmath113  @xmath77 , where @xmath119 ( 27  k ) is comparable to the lattice temperature @xmath118 ( 50  k ) .",
    "this means that holes also enter the degenerate regime at such a high density and the hole - hole scattering rate is then given by @xmath120.@xcite therefore , the hsr time increases with increasing the density for @xmath121  @xmath77 .",
    "one notices that the coulomb scattering can also induce a peak ( instead of valley ) in the density dependence of the electron spin relaxation time limited by the dp mechanism , first predicted by jiang and wu@xcite and realized experimentally by krau.@xcite      in this part , we study the hsr in @xmath0-type gaas .",

    "e.g. , at 5  k , the hsr time first increases and then decreases with increasing hole density . as a result , a peak appears at @xmath128  @xmath77 , where the corresponding fermi temperature @xmath111  k is comparable to the lattice temperature .",
    "as the temperature increases , the peak moves to the higher density regime ( @xmath129  @xmath77 with @xmath130  k for 20  k and @xmath131  @xmath77 with @xmath132  k for 50  k ) .",
    "simultaneously , a valley gradually appears in the low density regime .",
    "although the peak also locates at the crossover between the degenerate and nondegenerate regime , the underlying physics of the peak is again different from the one in the electron spin relaxation time in intrinsic and @xmath133-type materials.@xcite to explain the presence of the peak , we turn to analyze the change of the scattering strength .",
    "since the intraband splitting is too small to affect the hsr for the hole states near the zone - center , the hsr process is mainly determined by the ey mechanism instead of the dp mechanism for low density case , especially at low temperature .    as a qualitative analysis for the case @xmath124 , one can focus on the major scattering mechanism , i.e. , the hole - impurity scattering with the strength estimated by @xmath134 , where @xmath135 comes from the density of states and @xmath136 stands for the average over the distribution .",

    ", one has @xmath146 according to the debye - hckel screening,@xcite and @xmath147 . for @xmath148 ,",
    "one neglects the @xmath149 term in @xmath125 and obtains @xmath150 which indicates that the hsr time increases with increasing density in this case . for @xmath151 ,",
    "the screening constant is neglected , and @xmath125 can be written as @xmath152 which decreases with increasing density . in fig.[fig4](a ) , we also plot the density dependence of @xmath125 at 20  k ( the dotted curve without symbol ) , which agrees well with our discussion .",
    "it is clear to see that @xmath125 is in the same order of magnitude as the hsr time @xmath153 as expected .",
    "now , the peak and valley in the hsr time in fig.[fig4](a ) can be well understood .",
    "for example at 20  k , holes lie in the nondegenerate regime and the screening constant is small in the low density regime . as the density increases , the hsr time decreases according to eq.([eq17 ] ) . nevertheless , with further increase of the density , @xmath60 can be larger than @xmath138 .",
    "then the hsr time increases with density according to eq.([eq16 ] ) . by further increasing density",
    ", the system enters into the degenerate regime , and the hsr time decreases again following eq.([eq15 ] ) . by comparing fig.[fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we find the crossover between eqs.([eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) can still be qualitatively estimated by taking @xmath154 . at low temperature",
    "( 5  k ) , the screening constant is always large in the nondegenerate regime of our investigation [ see fig.[fig4](b ) ] , so the valley is invisible in fig.[fig4](a ) .",

    "the green dotted and blue dashed curves correspond to the results with the thomas - fermi and debye - hckel screenings , respectively .",
    "the total hsr time from the rpa screening is also plotted as the red solid curve .",
    "one can see that the result from the rpa screening is consistent with that from the thomas - fermi ( debye - hckel ) screening in the high ( low ) density regime and the peak in the density dependence exactly occurs at the crossover between the degenerate and nondegenerate regimes .",
    "in contrast , electrons in most @xmath133-type zinc - blende materials are easier to enter into the degenerate regime and the screening constant is usually small ( @xmath155 ) thanks to the small effective mass of the conduction band .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to observe the nonmonotonic effect of the screening during the electron spin relaxation .",
    "however , jiang and wu suggested that the screening from the holes in @xmath0-type materials can also give rise to observable effects on the electron spin relaxation.@xcite in that case , the ey mechanism is always irrelevant and the electron spin relaxation is dominated by the dp mechanism in the low hole density regime . since the spin relaxation time due to the dp mechanism is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering time in the strong scattering limit , the hole density dependence of the electron spin relaxation time there is opposite to that of the hsr time we predict here .",
    "specifically , they found that the electron spin relaxation time due to the dp mechanism first increases and then decreases as the hole density increases in the nondegenerate regime .",
    "after the holes enter into the degenerate regime , the electron spin relaxation time increases again .    from previous discussion ,",
    "one notices that the hsr properties can be well interpreted by the ey mechanism which suggests that the ey mechanism is generally more important than the dp one .",
    "this can be clearly seen from fig.[fig5](b ) , where the hsr times due to the ey and dp mechanisms are separately plotted .",
    "interestingly , we find that the contribution of the dp mechanism can be comparable to that of the ey mechanism in high doping regime . to explain this behavior , we employ the relation in the strong scattering limit , @xmath156 $ ] with @xmath157 representing the ensemble average of the effective magnetic field ( inhomogeneous broadening@xcite ) . in the low density regime ,",
    "the hole gas is in the nondegenerate limit and the inhomogeneous broadening is small and insensitive to the density .",
    "hence the contribution of the dp mechanism to the hsr is negligible .",
    "however , holes are in the degenerate limit for high density case and the inhomogeneous broadening increases rapidly [ @xmath158 , see eq.([eq6 ] ) also ] with increasing hole density , which makes the dp mechanism markedly contribute to the hsr . by using eq.([eq15 ] )",

    "one notices that the temperature dependence of the hsr time is also qualitatively determined by the ey mechanism ( curves with solid symbols ) .",
    "the hsr time from this mechanism first decreases and then increases with increasing temperature for @xmath164  @xmath77 , and the minimum reaches around 15  k. since the hole - phonon scattering is rather weak in this regime , this feature just reflects the important role of the screening in the hole - impurity scattering .",
    "figure[fig6](b ) illustrates the ratio of the screening constant to the fermi wave vector , where the crossover ( @xmath169 ) occurs just around 15  k. since holes are always nondegenerate in this case ( even at 5  k , see fig.[fig4 ] ) , the hsr time decreases ( increases ) with increasing temperature below ( above ) 15  k , according to eq.([eq16 ] ) [ eq.([eq17 ] ) ] .",
    "moreover , we find that the hsr time decreases again when the temperature further increases , because of the enhancement of the hole - phonon scattering .",
    "to demonstrate this picture , we remove the hole - phonon scattering from the ksbes and find that the hsr time due to the ey mechanism monotonically increases above 15  k , as expected ( shown as dotted curve without symbol ) . for @xmath165  @xmath77 , only the peak is visible while the valley is absent as the curve with solid squares shown .",
    "the reason is that the screening is weak for this density [ see fig.[fig6](b ) ] .",
    "however , for @xmath131 and @xmath168  @xmath77 , holes are in the degenerate regime at low temperature , hence the temperature dependence of the hsr time is determined by @xmath126 from eq.([eq15 ] ) . at high temperature regime , the hsr time is also limited by the hole - phonon scattering for these densities .",
    "another important information one can get from fig.[fig6](a ) is that the hsr time due to the dp mechanism is comparable to the one due to the ey mechanism around 80  k for @xmath165  @xmath77 . for the high doping case with @xmath170  @xmath77 , the important role of the dp mechanism at low temperature can also be clearly seen [ see also fig.[fig5](b ) ] .",
    ", as function of the doping density and temperature in @xmath0-type gaas with @xmath124 .",
    "the yellow dashed curves represent the borders with @xmath171 , width=302 ]      for thorough understanding of the relative contribution of the dp and ey mechanisms , we plot the ratio of the hsr times due to the ey and dp mechanisms @xmath172 as function of the density and temperature in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "it is clear to see that the hsr time is dominated by the ey mechanism at low temperature ( below 40  k ) upto @xmath173  @xmath77 .",
    "this is because that holes mainly occupy the states with small wave vectors and experience a small effective dresselhaus field . in the high density regime ,",
    "the increase of the inhomogeneous broadening makes the dp contribution significantly enhanced and even comparable to the ey one as discussed above .",
    "another interesting regime lies in the low density regime at moderate temperature , where the contribution of the dp mechanism can also be comparable to that of the ey mechanism .",
    "this originates from the reduction of the ey contribution due to the relatively weak hole - impurity scattering according to eq.([eq17 ] ) [ see fig.[fig6](a ) also ] .",
    "however , this effect is suppressed by the hole - phonon scattering at higher temperature , where the ey mechanism again is more efficient than the dp one . in the figure , we also plot the borders with @xmath174 as yellow dashed curves .",
    "finally , we should point out that the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism@xcite is neglected in our computation even in the intrinsic case .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the spin - flip process due to the electron - hole exchange interaction in intrinsic gaas occurs in the time scale of nanosecond,@xcite therefore this mechanism is irrelevant to the ultrafast spin relaxation of the hole system .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the hsr from the fully microscopic ksbes in intrinsic and @xmath0-type bulk gaas .",
    "we analyze the valence - band structure by considering the anisotropic property and the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we find that the degeneracy of the hh band and that of the lh band are both lifted by intraband splittings . the dp mechanism associated with the intraband precessions and the ey mechanism due to the direct spin - flip scattering",
    "are then explicitly studied , with the intraband coherence included .",
    "our result of intrinsic gaas shows good agreement with the experiment data at room temperature , where the ey mechanism is demonstrated to be the dominant spin relaxation mechanism due to the strong scattering process .",
    "we also show that the approach without the intraband coherence used in the literature is inadequate in accounting for the hsr and the nonpolar hole - optical - phonon , missed in the previous theoretical work , is important to the hsr .",
    "the temperature can markedly affect the hsr time by changing the strength of the hole - phonon scattering . at low temperature",
    ", we predict a valley due to the coulomb scattering in the hsr time at the crossover between the degenerate and the nondegenerate regimes of the electrons . in @xmath0-type gaas , we find that the hsr time depends on density and temperature nonmonotonically . for the density dependence , the hsr time presents a peak at the crossover between the degenerate and nondegenerate regimes of the holes , resulting from the different features of the screening in the degenerate and nondegenerate limits . in the nondegenerate regime",
    ", we predict a valley , from the competition between the screening constant and the momentum exchange , in the density dependence of the hsr time .",
    "we also find that the hsr time monotonically decreases with increasing density at high temperature , thanks to the small screening constant .",

    ", the hole - phonon scattering can markedly contribute to the hsr and make the hsr time decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "moreover , we find that the contribution of the dp mechanism can be comparable with that of the ey one in the high density regime at low temperature and in the low density regime at moderate temperature , even though the ey mechanism is usually the major mechanism in the hsr .",
