    "the central goal underlying the research area of _ logic of theory change _ is the study of the changes which can occur in the belief state of a rational agent when he receives new information .",
    "the most well known model of theory change was proposed by @xcite and is , nowadays , known as the agm model . assuming that the belief state of an agent is modelled by a _ belief set _ ( i.e. a logically closed set of sentences ) , this framework essentially provides a definition for contractions  i.e. functions that receive a sentence ( representing the new information received by the agent ) , and return a belief set which is a subset of the original one that does not contain the received sentence . in the mentioned paper , the class of _ partial meet contractions",
    "_ was introduced and axiomatically characterized .",
    "subsequently several constructive models have been presented for the class of contraction functions proposed in the agm framework ( such as the _ system of spheres - based contractions _",
    "@xcite , _ safe / kernel contractions _ @xcite , and the _ epistemic entrenchment - based contractions _",
    "also several adaptations and variations of those constructive models have been presented and studied in the literature as it is the case , for example , of _ severe withdrawals _ ( or mild contractions or rott s contractions ) @xcite which results of _ simplifying _ the definition of _ epistemic entrenchment - based contractions_.    although the agm model has quickly acquired the status of standard model of theory change , several researchers ( for an overview see @xcite ) have pointed out its inadequateness in several contexts and proposed several extensions and generalizations to that framework .",
    "one of the most relevant of the proposed extensions of the agm model of contraction is to use sets of sentences not ( necessarily ) closed under logical consequence  which are designated belief bases  rather than belief sets to represent belief states .",
    "hence , several of the existing models ( of agm contractions ) were generalized to the case when belief states are represented by belief bases instead of belief sets . among those we emphasize the _ ensconcement - based contractions _ and",
    "the _ brutal base contractions _ ( of belief bases ) proposed in @xcite , which can be seen as adaptations to the case of belief bases of the _ epistemic entrenchment - based contractions _ and of the _ severe withdrawals _ , respectively .",
    "in fact , the definitions of those operations are both based on the concept of _ ensconcement _ , which is an adaptation of the concept of epistemic entrenchment relation to the case of belief bases . in the mentioned paper mary - anne williams",
    "has also presented a method for constructing an epistemic entrenchment from an ensconcement relation .    in the present paper",
    "we will study the interrelation among _ brutal base contractions _ ( of belief bases ) and _ severe withdrawals _",
    "( of belief sets ) . more precisely , we will devote special attention to the class of _ brutal base contractions _ which are based on bounded ensconcements  the so - called _ bounded brutal base contractions _  and also to the class of the so - called _ ensconcement - based severe withdrawals _",
    ", which is formed by the severe withdrawals that are based on an epistemic entrenchment relation defined from a bounded ensconcement using mary - anne william s method . we shall provide axiomatic characterizations to each one of those classes of functions and study the interrelation among them .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : firstly we provide the notation and background needed for the rest of the paper .",
    "after that we provide axiomatic characterizations for the classes of _ bounded brutal base contractions _ and of _ ensconcement - based severe withdrawals_. furthermore we show how to define a _",
    "bounded brutal base contraction _ from an _ ensconcement - based severe withdrawal _ and vice - versa .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize the main contributions of the paper . in the appendix we provide proofs for the theorems .",

    "a total preorder on @xmath14 is bounded if and only if it is both well - ranked and inversely well - ranked .      the agm model of belief change",
    "was proposed by @xcite and acquired the status of standard model of belief change . in this model beliefs",
    "are represented by a set of sentences closed under logical consequence . in the agm framework",
    "there are three operations to be considered , namely expansion , contraction and revision .",
    "expansion , consists of adding new information ( represented by sentences ) in the original set preserving logical closure .",
    "contraction , consists of eliminating sentences from a belief set , in such a way that the remaining set does not imply a specified sentence .",
    "revision , consists in incorporating a sentence in the original set , but ( eventually ) eliminating some sentences in order to retain consistency of the revised set .",
    "agm has been characterized in , at least five , different ways : _ postulates _ , _ partial meet functions _ , _",
    "epistemic entrenchment_,_safe / kernel contraction _ and _ grove sphere - systems _",
    "( for an overview see @xcite ) .",
    "+ one of the postulates included in the axiomatic characterization of the contraction operator is recovery :    * ( recovery ) * +    _ recovery _ is based in the principle that  it is reasonable to require that we get all of the beliefs [ ... ] back again after first contracting and then expanding with respect to the same belief \" @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the _ recovery _ postulate have been criticized by several authors @xcite as a general principle that contractions should hold .",
    "alternative contraction models were proposed in which the _ recovery _ postulate does not hold , for instance : levi contraction @xcite , severe withdrawal @xcite and semi - contraction @xcite .",
    "epistemic entrenchment was introduced in @xcite and relies on the idea that contractions on a belief set @xmath15 should be based on an ordering of its sentences according to their epistemic entrenchment . when a belief set @xmath15 is contracted it is prefered to give up beliefs with lower entrechment over others with a higher entrechment .",
    "grdenfors proposed the following set of axioms that an epistemic entrechment order @xmath16 related to a belief set @xmath15 should satisfy : + * ( ee1 ) * +   * ( ee2 ) * +   * ( ee3 ) * +   * * * ( ee4 ) * +   * ( ee5 ) * +    if @xmath16 is well - ranked and inversely well - ranked , then the epistemic entrenchment is well - ranked and inversely well - ranked , and therefore is a bounded epistemic entrenchment .",
    "the relation @xmath16 of epistemic entrenchment is independent of the change functions in the sense that it does not refer to any contraction or revision function . in addition to stating the axioms of entrenchment , grdenfors proposed the following entrenchment - based contraction functions : + * ( @xmath17 ) * +    the crucial clause of @xmath18 is @xmath19 .",
    "this clause can be justified with reference to the recovery postulate @xcite .",
