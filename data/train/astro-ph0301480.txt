    "the selection of candidates using @xmath10 band magnitudes rather than blue magnitudes ( which are more affected by absorption and reddening ) , and its area and depth , the sdss is effective at finding unusual quasars ( e.g. , fan et  al .",
    "many of these objects are unusual broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars .",
    "bal quasars show absorption from gas with typical outflow velocities of 0.1@xmath11 ( weymann et  al .",
    "1991 ) and mass loss rates probably comparable to the accretion rates required to power quasars ( @xmath12  @xmath13yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore an understanding of bal outflows is required for an understanding of quasars as a whole .",
    "usually bal troughs are only seen in high ionization species , but about 15% of bal quasars also show absorption from low ionization species , including absorption from excited fine - structure levels or terms of  and  in rare cases . in ( 2002 ,",
    "hereafter h02 ) we presented several examples of ` overlapping - trough ' bal quasars whose flux shortward of  is almost completely absorbed by troughs of excited  ( which is of course also accompanied by ground - state  absorption ) . in this paper",
    "we present a high - resolution spectrum of one such object , sdss j030000.56 + 004828.0 ( hereafter simply sdss j0300 + 0048 ) at @xmath14 , and use it to constrain the column densities and possible structure of its impressive outflow .",
    "sdss j0300 + 0048 is only the fourth quasar known to have a  bal trough (  5.2.1 of h02),1241 have much larger blueshifts than the outflows studied by ( 2002 ) . ] and only the second to be studied at high resolution , after qso j2359@xmath151241 ( arav et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "both quasars have  detached \" absorption troughs that do not start at the systemic redshift : those in qso j2359@xmath151241 set in at a blueshift of @xmath0750kms@xmath1 , and those in sdss j0300 + 0048 at a blueshift of @xmath01700kms@xmath1 .",

    "the quasar is one issue we consider in this paper .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the most common method of analyzing intrinsic absorption lines , then apply this method to sdss j0300 + 0048 , and finally discuss our results .",
    "suppose we observe unblended doublet absorption from a bal region covering a fraction @xmath16 of the quasar s light with an optical depth @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting normalized residual intensities in the two lines of the doublet as a function of velocity @xmath18 are : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ratio of the optical depth of line 2 to that of line 1 ( the @xmath22 are the statistical weights , the @xmath23 the oscillator strengths , and the @xmath24 the wavelengths of the lines ) .",
    "our convention is that @xmath25 refers to the stronger line of the doublet and @xmath26 refers to the optical depth in that line . for any doublet with @xmath27 , such as  and , these equations yield the following solutions ( hamann et  al .",
    "1997 ) and associated uncertainties for @xmath28 and @xmath26 : @xmath29 ^ 2}}{(1+i_1 - 2i_2)^2}\\ ] ] @xmath30 where it is understood that @xmath25 and @xmath31 are functions of velocity .",
    "the solution for @xmath28 , and thus for @xmath26 as well , is only physical ( @xmath32 ) when @xmath33 the last of the above conditions could be violated in the case of saturated absorption partially filled in by optically thin emission from the same doublet transition responsible for the absorption .",
    "the next to last could be invalidated by the presence in the spectrum of significant host galaxy or scattered quasar light .",
    "the above equations can also break down if there are different covering factors for different emission regions ( e.g. , the continuum source , the broad emission line ( bel ) region , and the  emission region ; see  [ vrb ] and 1999 ) or if the emissivities of the covered and uncovered regions are different functions of velocity ( as pointed out by & shankaranarayanan 1999 and observed by , e.g. , 2003 ) . moreover , the assumption that a fraction @xmath16 of the quasar s light is occulted at a single optical depth @xmath17 and that the remaining light is unobscured is likely to itself be an approximation ( de kool , korista , & arav 2002b ) , and would be inappropriate if there are cases where the resonance scattering interpretation of bal quasars is correct ( branch et  al .",
    "nevertheless , the above equations are useful for studying bal troughs , even if only to verify that one or more of the above complications is occurring .",
    "observations of several sdss bal quasars were obtained on ut 10 - 12 aug 2001 using the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) unit 2 ( kueyen ) and ultra - violet echelle spectrograph ( uves ) .",
    "this section provides observational details for all objects ; science results for sdss j2215@xmath150045 and sdss j1453 + 0029 can be found in & hutsemkers ( 2003 ) , and for sdss j0011@xmath440055 in hutsemkers et  al .",

    "because the 3030@xmath153880  setting had a very low signal - to - noise ratio and yielded different results for the two exposures , it is not used in this paper .",
    "the extraction for the 3730@xmath154990  setting was determined manually in places where the flux was zero over several orders .",
    "telluric absorption lines were removed for the red settings using observations of telluric standard stars , shifted in velocity according to the different times of the observations and scaled in intensity according to the airmass difference . whenever two or three exposures of each setting were available ,",
    "their extracted spectra were averaged with rejection of cosmic rays and known ccd artifacts",

    "there is weak [ ]  emission at @xmath49 , which is a blueshift of 166@xmath50111  kms@xmath1   ( using 3728.48  for the unresolved doublet s vacuum rest wavelength ) .      to analyze the absorption in sdss j0300 + 0048 in a rigorously correct manner , we must know or be able to model its intrinsic , unabsorbed continuum at the wavelengths where absorption is present",
    "constructing such a continuum for the transitions of interest in sdss j0300 + 0048 ( ,  and ) requires the matching of complex blends of iron emission and absorption .",
    "figure [ f_0300fe2fit ] shows the sdss rest frame spectrum of sdss j0300 + 0048 ( solid line ) .",
    "the emission features longward of  are plausibly identifiable as blends of  and , as discussed in  5.2 of h02 , though we now recognize that tiii  emission is also likely to contribute ( kwan et  al .",
    "the dashed line shows one possible model for the unabsorbed continuum of sdss j0300 + 0048 , consisting of a flat - in-@xmath51 power - law plus a scaled and smoothed iron emission template .",
    "this template was constructed by fitting and subtracting a power - law to the spectrum of the bright , narrow - lined , strong -emitting quasar sdss j092332.33 + 574557.4 ( d. p. schneider et  al . , in preparation ) , using continuum windows at 1680 - 1700  and 3675 - 3710 .",
    "because the template is intended for illustrative purposes only , no attempt was made to exclude emission from  or other non - iron transitions or to optimize the slope of the power - law continuum component of the model spectrum .",
    "this model spectrum is a good match to the emission feature just shortward of 3000 , the blue side of which may be affected by absorption , and to the wavelength extent of the weak feature at 3400 - 3600 . however , this latter feature is much stronger in sdss j0300 + 0048 than in the model , sdss j0300 + 0048 has emission features at 3025  and 3250  not seen in the model ( the latter could be tiii ) , and there are two features around 3100  in the template that are not seen in sdss j0300 + 0048 . given these discrepancies between the model spectrum and the observed spectrum , we can not use the model spectrum to predict the intrinsic continuum of sdss j0300 + 0048 at @xmath46@xmath522900  with any confidence . in the future it may be possible to find another strong -emitting quasar whose spectrum better matches that of sdss j0300 + 0048 at @xmath46@xmath533000 , but this is the best match we have found to date in the sdss or in the literature ( e.g. , , clowes , & campusano 1996 ) . note that the fe emission templates of & green ( 1992 ) and & wilkes ( 2001 ) only cover 4250 - 7000  and 1250 - 3090 , respectively .",
    "alternatively , if we could match the @xmath46@xmath533000  spectrum of sdss j0300 + 0048 using a theoretical model , we could use that model to predict its unabsorbed continuum at @xmath46@xmath523000 .",
    "however , published theoretical  emission models either do not extend to @xmath46@xmath533200  ( verner et  al .",
    "1999 ) or do not include sufficient transitions at @xmath46@xmath533200  to match observations ( sigut & pradhan 2003 ) , and the situation for other possibly important ions such as  and tiii  is no better .    thus at present we have no reliable model for the unabsorbed continuum of sdss j0300 + 0048 at the wavelengths of ,  or . for",
    ", we can construct a reasonable local continuum .",
    "for ,  and other transitions at even shorter wavelengths we must keep in mind that a local continuum estimate probably underestimates the unabsorbed continuum by a factor of @xmath02 , unless dust reddening produces a turnover in the unabsorbed spectrum .      to remove the narrow associated @xmath463934  blended with the broad @xmath463969 , we must model the associated system .",
    "this procedure yielded interesting results , but ones tangential to the main paper , and so is discussed in appendix [ appabs ] .",
    "figure [ f_broad5way ] shows the normalized spectrum of sdss j0300 + 0048 around the broad absorption troughs of five separate transitions .",
    "the heavier lines denote spectral regions that are not confused with absorption from different transitions .",
    "each transition has unique , unconfused velocity ranges , as we now discuss ( from top to bottom in figure [ f_broad5way ] ) .",
    "the  trough starts at about 1650  kms@xmath1 , and is at least 5500  kms@xmath1  wide ;  is confused with @xmath462773 ( uv63 ) at @xmath537150  kms@xmath1 .",
    "an upper limit to the  trough width is impossible to determine , given that the continuum does not return to its unabsorbed level anywhere shortward of   ( figure [ f_0300sb2 ] ) .",
    "however , a reasonable maximum velocity can be inferred from the uv63 absorption , which disappears by @xmath010850  kms@xmath1   for the uv63 multiplet line with the shortest wavelength ( 2715 ) .",
    "that maximum velocity implies a  trough at least 9200  kms@xmath1  broad .",
    "the  absorption appears to start when the  trough appears to saturate , at @xmath02000  kms@xmath1 .",
    "it is unclear just how high a velocity the  absorption reaches , both because  is confused with associated  at @xmath535200  kms@xmath1  and because the continuum normalization between  and  is very uncertain .",
    "the   might reach only @xmath04000  kms@xmath1 , matching the strong  absorption , in which case the alternate continuum normalization shown by the tilted dashed line in the figure would be more appropriate .",
    "alternatively , the   might reach @xmath06400  kms@xmath1 , matching the possible highest - velocity , or even extend to @xmath537150  kms@xmath1   like   in which case it would overlap with .",
    "the broad  was normalized by a simple linear continuum fit to two narrow wavelength regions around 7294  and 7478 .",
    "to determine the blending in , we use the fact that @xmath463934 is the stronger line of the doublet , which means we can be sure that the highest velocity detectable absorption is from it and not from even higher velocity @xmath463969 .",
    "the @xmath463934 absorption does not appear to reach velocities as large as the  absorption does , but instead disappears by @xmath05657  kms@xmath1 .",
    "given that the velocity separation of the  doublet is 2640.1  kms@xmath1 , the @xmath463934 trough is unblended only at 3017 - 5657  kms@xmath1 .",
    "similarly , because the @xmath463969 absorption only starts at 1697  kms@xmath1 , the @xmath463969 trough is unblended only at 1697 - 4337  kms@xmath1   ( discounting the narrow associated @xmath463934 near 2640  kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "ground - state  absorption is undoubtably present at all velocities where  is seen , because the density and ionization conditions under which the two ions exist are very similar .",
    "however , at the lowest velocities in the outflow , the fine - structure levels of  are not populated and so excited  absorption is not seen at those velocities , as first noted in h02 . the @xmath462632 absorption ( arising from an excited fine - structure level in the ground term , this is the longest wavelength line of the uv1 multiplet ) is slightly contaminated by associated @xmath462600 ( the strongest transition in the uv1 multiplet , this line is from the lowest fine - structure level in the ground term , not an excited level ) .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that the broad @xmath462632 absorption begins at a velocity that matches the highest - velocity component of the main   trough ( see  [ cafe ] ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the high - velocity limit of the  absorption is at least 10850  kms@xmath1 .",
    "all the above are low - ionization species , so at first glance it may seem surprising that they have different velocity distributions .",
    "however , the ionization potentials of  and  are higher than that of , while those of  and  are lower .",
    "this difference can lead to very different behavior for the latter two ions , as discussed in ",
    "[ codis ] .      to begin the quantitative analysis of the broad  absorption",
    ", we used eqs . 8 - 9 to solve for @xmath28 and @xmath26 in the unblended outflow at 3017 - 4337  kms@xmath1  ( velocity regime b ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ f_cerrtau0300b ] , where the original pixels have been binned by a factor of 5 in order to achieve an acceptable signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "we defer a detailed discussion of this figure until later in this section .",
    "note that no points are plotted for velocity bins where the residual intensities do not allow a physical solution because one or more of the conditions of equation  [ e_valid ] are violated .",
    "this situation occurs for 37% of the original pixels in velocity regime b. inspection of the velocities where the residual intensities did not allow a physical solution suggested that our continuum normalization was an underestimate .",
    "thus we refit the continuum using a third - order legendre polynomial between two narrow wavelength regions around 7278  and 7496 .",
    "this normalization yielded only a slight increase in the number of pixels where the residual intensities allowed a physical solution , suggesting that our continuum normalization is not the major source of error in that respect .",
    "one possible source of error is scattered light or host galaxy light that does not pass through the bal region and thus fills in the absorption troughs .",
    "host galaxy light should be a @xmath54% effect because this quasar is quite luminous ( @xmath55 for @xmath56kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ; d. p. schneider et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the observed minimum residual intensity in the broad  trough is 6.0@xmath501.5% of the continuum , and so that is the maximum percentage that unabsorbed scattered light or host galaxy light can contribute to the observed continuum . to test the effects of a maximal contribution from unabsorbed scattered light , we subtracted 0.06 from the residual intensity at all velocities , renormalized by 0.94 , and repeated our calculation of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this adjustment slightly decreased the number of pixels with allowed physical solutions , suggesting that ignoring the contribution of scattered light does not greatly affect the calculation of @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "another possible source of error is our assumption that the covering factor is the same for the featureless continuum source and  emission regions .",
    "doublet absorption does not provide enough information to solve for two covering factors independently .",
    "however ,  4.2 of ( 1999 ) discusses how joint constraints on @xmath59 and @xmath60 can still be made , given the ratio @xmath61 of the flux to the continuum source flux . for a lower limit of @xmath62 in sdss j0300 + 0048",
    ", the situation lies in between that of a single covering factor and the scattered light case considered previously , so assuming a single covering factor is reasonable . in the more realistic @xmath63 case ,",
    "the covering factors have similar , large values ( maxima of @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) and assuming a single covering factor again appears reasonable . at most velocities .",
    "however , refitting @xmath28 and @xmath26 for such a scenario yields a large increase in the number of pixels that do not correspond to a physical solution .",
    "]    neither the details of the assumed continuum , the neglect of scattered light , or the assumption of a single covering factor appear responsible for the relatively large fraction of pixels ( 37% ) for which the residual intensities in the  doublet lines do not allow a physical solution for @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "the explanation for these pixels must lie primarily in the random noise .",
    "this explanation is consistent with figure [ f_cerrtau0300b ] , which shows that the bulk of the pixels without physical solutions lie in the regions of weak absorption , where the noise is comparable to the strength of the absorption .",
    "( the average s / n per pixel in the  trough is 17 , with a range between 8 and 24 . )",
    "considering figure [ f_cerrtau0300b ] in more detail , we see that in many individual velocity bins ( each consisting of five original pixels ) both the minimum @xmath28 solution ( thin red line ) and the @xmath66 solution are formally acceptable at the 68% confidence level ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "however , the lower panel of figure [ f_cerrtau0300b ] shows that overall the covering factor in the unblended outflow is statistically inconsistent with both limiting cases .",
    "neither @xmath66 at all velocities nor @xmath28 having its minimum value at all velocities are good fits to the data as a whole .",
    "the upper panel corroborates the conclusion that the uniform @xmath66 solution is unacceptable : that solution corresponds to @xmath26 having its minimum value at all velocities , whereas the best - fit optical depth is consistently larger than the minimum .      to model the @xmath463934  absorption in velocity regime a ( 4337 - 5657  kms@xmath1 ) , we extrapolate from the absorption at 4000 - 4337  kms@xmath1  in velocity regime b. the absorption there , while noisy , is much more consistent with the minimum @xmath28 than with @xmath66 , and",
    "the optical depth is consistent with being constant at its weighted average of @xmath68 .",
    "we adopt a fixed @xmath69 for regime a , which means that the corresponding fractional absorption in @xmath463969   is 61% of that in @xmath463934   and that the covering factor @xmath28 is 1.71 times its minimum possible value at each @xmath18 .",
    "we also calculate the limiting minimum-@xmath28 and @xmath66 cases , as they delimit the range of plausible systematic errors .      to the observed residual @xmath463934  intensities in this velocity range ,",
    "we add back in the fractional absorption in high - velocity @xmath463969  estimated in the previous section .",
    "we then solve for @xmath28 and @xmath26 as per usual .",
    "figure [ f_cerrtau0300c ] shows the results .",
    "the uncertainty ranges shown as the grey areas include the systematic uncertainties arising from the removal of the high - velocity @xmath463969 .",
    "note that the removal of high - velocity @xmath463969  resulted in a large increase in the number of pixels in this velocity regime with valid physical solutions .",
    "in most velocity bins , the minimum @xmath28 solution can not be ruled out but the @xmath66 solution can . on average , however , @xmath28 is significantly larger than the required minimum value .",
    "this behavior is similar to that in velocity regime b , though not as pronounced .",
    "figure [ f_cerrtau0300bc ] shows the optical depth and covering factor over the velocity range of strong  absorption . as mentioned previously , the covering factor is on average significantly greater than the minimum value , though it tracks the minimum value more closely in velocity regime c than in regime b. the  outflow is moderately saturated ( @xmath70 ) , with only one significant spike above 4 .",
    "thus , in general , the covering factor determines much  but not all  of the shape of the absorption profile in the  outflow .",

    "nonetheless , we can rule out the possibility that excited  is present at 2000 - 3500  kms@xmath1  with nonblack saturation .",

    "qso j2359@xmath151241 has just enough column density to have a hydrogen ionization front ( @xmath116 at the lyman limit ) .",
    "the @xmath0200 times larger  column density in sdss j0300 + 0048 means that it must have a strong hydrogen ionization front .",

    "2003 ) , it would have to have a  region with @xmath118 times larger than in qso j2359@xmath151241 , corresponding to @xmath119 at the lyman limit .",
    "the presence of an  ionization front in sdss j0300 + 0048 agrees with expectations from photoionization calculations ( ferland & persson 1989 ) . an ionization front surrounding the quasar can shield  and  from ionization ( voit , weymann , & korista 1993 ) .",

    "this requirement has implications for the structure of the outflow , because it means that the excited  bal region can not be farther from the quasar than the  bal region .",
    "if it was , it would lie outside the   ionization front and would also show strong  absorption .",
    "( the weak  absorption from the excited  region means that at most @xmath12310% of the excited -absorbing gas could lie outside the front . )",
    "this fact , along with the observations that the broad absorption is detached from the systemic redshift and that the  bal region lies at low velocities ( 1697 - 3740  kms@xmath1 ) while the excited  bal region lies at high velocities ( 3740 - 8221  kms@xmath1  and beyond ) , enable us to constrain which of two representative , competing bal outflow models might explain sdss j0300 + 0048 .",
    "these models are the disk wind model of ( 1995 ) and a model where the absorption arises in confined clouds embedded with very small filling factor in a less dense , hotter medium ( e.g. , arav & li 1994 ) .",
    "such clouds could form a dusty outflow that nearly surrounds the quasar ( e.g , .",
    "becker et  al .",
    "2000 ) , or they could be ` ablated ' from denser sources , such as an accretion disk or obscuring torus , and only block some lines of sight to the quasar .    in the radiatively driven disk wind model of ( 1995 ) , the streamlines of the outflow begin at some angle to the disk and then bend to become asymptotically radial ( in radial cross - section ) .",
    "thus the detachment velocity simply reflects the height above the disk reached by the flow before it crosses the line of sight to the continuum source ; that height could be different for different ions .",
    "as the distance from the quasar increases _ along a single streamline _ , the velocity and ionization increases and the density decreases . for _ two _ streamlines arising at _ different _ initial radii",
    ", the more distant streamline will be scaled up in density ( & sunyaev 1973 ) but down in velocity and ionization parameter ( 1995 ) .",
    "because we see a detached flow in sdss j0300 + 0048 , in this model our line of sight must cross numerous streamlines .",
    "thus , we expect to see higher - velocity gas that is less dense , more highly ionized , and located at smaller radii .",
    "the bal outflow in sdss j0300 + 0048 is consistent with such a disk wind , as the lowest - ionization gas ( traced by  and ) is found at the lowest velocities . to be consistent with the observed anticoincidence of excited  absorption and  absorption",
    "requires that a disk wind in sdss j0300 + 0048 have @xmath124 @xmath107 throughout but @xmath125  k at the low velocities ( large radii ) where  is present .",
    "if the velocity decreases monotonically with radius along the line of sight , then the  ionization front will shield gas at all velocities less than some velocity @xmath126 . because the  absorption can only arise outside the  ionization front , we surmise either that @xmath127  kms@xmath1 , which is the maximum observed  velocity , or that @xmath128  kms@xmath1 , which divides strong and weak  absorption , and that the higher - velocity  absorption is due to a small portion ( by mass ) of the outflow departing from a monotonically decreasing velocity .",
    "if the  trough were not saturated , it might reveal the velocity of the front , as the ionic fraction of  increases sharply outside the front ( voit et  al . 1993 ) .",
    "if we try to explain the  absorption as arising from clouds with a lower density than the clouds giving rise to excited  absorption , but at similar radii , then the  bal clouds must have @xmath106  @xmath107 while the excited-  bal clouds have a higher @xmath110 and lower @xmath129 , assuming all clouds are in pressure balance with the same confining medium . however , the column density in the  clouds must be larger than that in the excited-  bal clouds , which leads to an improbable scenario where diffuse clouds reach high column densities but dense clouds do not . thus , as in the disk wind case , we are driven to a scenario where the excited  bal clouds must have @xmath124  @xmath107 while the  bal clouds have an even higher @xmath110 but a temperature @xmath125  k , to avoid populating the excited  levels .    for a cloud scenario where the outflow surrounds the quasar , the outflow must have smaller velocities at larger radii because the  bal region must lie at larger radii than the excited  bal region .",
    "this velocity distribution might occur if this quasar recently ` turned on ' inside a relatively thick shell or torus of gas , and has gradually radiatively accelerated ( and radially compressed ) it such that the velocity in the shell is a decreasing function of radius .",
    "the  absorption would arise in the outermost regions of the flow , which have only been accelerated to velocities of @xmath02000 - 4000  kms@xmath1  so far .",
    "this scenario is rather contrived , especially as such an outflow will be rayleigh - taylor unstable ( though magnetic fields might suppress the instabilities ) , but it can be tested by looking for a long - term increase in the velocity of the  bal outflow .    a cloud scenario where the outflow does _ not _ surround",
    "the quasar can explain the detached troughs by positing that the injection points of the clouds ( where they have @xmath130 ) do not lie along our line of sight to the continuum source , and that there is some finite outer radius for the injection that corresponds to the minimum radial velocity we observe .",
    "thus the outflow can not be spherically symmetric , as such a flow would have injection points along all lines of sight .",
    "injection of clouds from a disk or torus is still feasible .",
    "the clouds must cross our line of sight in a spatially- and velocity - segregated flow , as in the disk wind case , because the ( low - velocity ) -absorbing clouds must be at larger radii than the ( high - velocity ) -absorbing clouds .",
    "if clouds of all velocities were intermixed , the gas in any high - velocity clouds shadowed by a low - velocity -absorbing cloud would recombine to lower ionization states on timescales of @xmath131 seconds .",
    "the result would be  absorption at high velocities as well as low , which is not seen .",
    "thus , for a cloud model to explain this outflow the clouds must form either a rather contrived expanding shell or a segregated flow arising from a disk or torus .",
    "the latter case differs from the disk wind model only in the presence of an intermixed , hot , confining medium for the gas responsible for the low - ionization absorption .",
    "finally , it is not clear how the associated absorption fits in to either the cloud or the disk wind model .",
    "however , in both models it must arise far enough from the continuum source that it has not been significantly accelerated along our line of sight .",
    "another of the five overlapping - trough bal quasars in h02 , sdss j0819 + 4209 , has bal troughs detached from an aal system .",
    "that object has a similar detachment velocity ( @xmath132  kms@xmath1 ) , but the  aal appears to be broader than in sdss j0300 + 0048 .",
    "anecdotally , aals and detached bals appear to be common in additional overlapping - trough quasars being found by the sdss , but the possible significance of this finding to models of these outflows remains unclear .",
    "comparison with qso j2359@xmath151241 , the only other  bal quasar studied at high resolution , suggests that the outflow in sdss j0300 + 0048 has a strong  ionization front , in agreement with the photoionization modeling of  by & persson ( 1989 ) .",
    "the observed   absorption must arise in low - ionization gas located outside the ionization front .",
    "kinematically , the outflow is detached  it only begins at a velocity blueshifted by @xmath01700  kms@xmath1  from the associated absorption redshift .",
    "furthermore , excited  absorption is seen only at high velocities , and strong  absorption only at the low velocity end of the outflow .",
    "the velocity and ionization structure in the sdss j0300 + 0048 outflow can be explained in a disk wind model where the  arises only at large radii . a cloud model for the bal outflow can explain the observations if the clouds form a segregated flow originating from a source out of our line of sight  in other words , a clumpy disk wind instead of a smooth one ( e.g. , everett 2003 ) .",
    "an outflow of clouds that completely surrounds the quasar can explain the observations only in the case of a shell of gas in which the velocity decreases with increasing radius and in which the gas has been uniformly accelerated such that none of it has velocities @xmath133  kms@xmath1 . while this model is rather contrived , it is testable because it predicts a long - term increase in the observed velocity of the outflow .",
    "the region producing excited  absorption must have @xmath124  @xmath107 and @xmath134  k to significantly populate the observed fine structure levels . in any of these models , it is almost certain that the region producing  absorption also has @xmath124",
    "@xmath107 , in which case the -absorbing region must have @xmath2  k  and perhaps as low as @xmath3  k  to prevent excited  states from being populated there .",
    "more generally , quasars with  troughs ( and thus  ionization fronts ) which are detached in velocity enable a test to be made of the ( 1995 ) analytic disk wind model prediction of a monotonically decreasing velocity with increasing radius along the line of sight .",
    "because the lowest velocity absorption arises outside the front , no absorption from high - ionization gas ( e.g. ,  or ) should be present at the lowest velocities .",
    "( undetached troughs are not useful for this test because if the streamlines produce gas with zero velocity along the line of sight at one radius , they could easily produce such gas at many different radii . )",
    "unfortunately , this test can not be made in sdss j0300 + 0048 because   absorption obliterates the spectrum .",
    "it might be possible with spectra covering  in  lobals with narrower troughs , such as first j104459.6 + 365605 , whose  absorption is found at the low - velocity end of its higher - velocity outflow ( white et  al .",
    "2000 ; de kool et  al .",

    "1995 ; rupke et  al .",
    "in fact , wide ranges of ionization states at identical velocities are often seen in bal outflows ( e.g. , arav et  al .",

    "whether it is associated with the bal outflow is unclear .",

    "however , there is clear evidence for @xmath462382 absorption ( figure [ f_6way ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "this spectral region is equally noisy , but in this case the absorption _ is _ consistent with being 93% of the surrounding continuum.2586 region in figure [ f_6way ] is identical to that used for @xmath462600 : it is flat in @xmath51 at the level of the spectrum just longward of @xmath462600 .",
    "this same continuum was used to normalize the @xmath462382 region , for lack of a better assumption .",
    "however , the normalization does not affect the interpretation of why associated absorption from @xmath462586 was not detected . ]",
    "the same is true for @xmath462374 , while the @xmath462344 region is too noisy for analysis .",
    "the apparent lack of @xmath462586 absorption rules out the simple picture of a bal trough and an associated absorption line system ( aal ) that each absorb spatially fixed regions of quasar emission , shown schematically in the top panel of figure [ f_partcover0300 ] .",
    "this conclusion applies even if the bal or aal regions are not well characterized by a single @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( de kool et  al .",
    "to explain our observations requires some variation with velocity in the quasar emission region covered by the bal trough .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ f_partcover0300 ] is a sketch of this spatially distinct , velocity - dependent partial covering .",
    "the reason the bal region can partially cover spatially distinct emission regions at the wavelengths of the two associated  transitions is that the broad  absorption includes absorption from excited fine - structure levels , while the narrow  absorption arises from only the ground level . at the zero - velocity wavelength of associated @xmath462382 ,",
    "the broad  absorption can be approximated as having some velocity @xmath149 . because it consists of absorption in different  multiplet uv2 transitions ( both ground and excited ) at different velocities , @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the relative strength of line @xmath10 at velocity @xmath152 .",
    "similarly , at the zero - velocity wavelength of associated @xmath462586 , the broad  absorption will consist of ground and excited   multiplet uv1 transitions and can be approximated as having velocity @xmath153 .",
    "the velocities @xmath149 and @xmath154 will be similar _ but not identical_. therefore , the covering factors can differ as well , both numerically ( @xmath155 ) and in the spatial regions covered .",
    "in sdss j0300 + 0048 , those different covering factors as a function of velocity allow the associated and broad  absorbers to overlap the same spatial region at the wavelength of associated @xmath462586 but not at the wavelength of associated @xmath462382 .",
    "this wavelength difference translates to a velocity difference @xmath156  kms@xmath1  over which there must be considerable variation in the regions being partially covered .",
    "similar effects have been seen before in fbqs 1408 + 3054 (  6.1.2 of h02 ) and ngc 3783 ( gabel et  al . 2003 ) .",
    "we can not prove that the associated absorber is external to the bal region , but we have shown that such a geometry , coupled with the spatially distinct , velocity - dependent partial covering that must be present , can explain our observations .",
    "we therefore used this ` external ' assumption to remove the associated  absorption from the broad  trough .",
