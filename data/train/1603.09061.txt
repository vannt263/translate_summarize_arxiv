    "in modern electronic devices the nanoscale miniaturization and sub - kelvin temperatures are quite common , however the physical phenomena taking place in such conditions are far from complete understanding and attract a great deal of research interest .",
    "in this work we address an aspect of the electron - phonon interaction in confined systems related to heat transfer between electrons and phonons .",
    "this is an open problem in the fundamental sense with a direct connection to current research activity and important applications in a variety of fields from nanoelectronics to astrophysics .",
    "for instance , in a recent paper @xcite the principle of electronic cooling @xcite has been used to realize the coolest microfridge  reaching a record temperature of less than @xmath2 mk . in a typical setup a cooled metal part is suspended or mounted on an insulating support layer in contact with superconductors forming two symmetrically biased nis ( normal metal - insulator - superconductor ) tunnel junctions . in this setup hot  electrons from above the fermi level are evacuated from the normal metal island , while cold  electrons are injected below the fermi level .",
    "such microdevices can be mounted directly on a chip for cooling qubits or ultrasensitive low - temperature detectors , e.g. , bolometers or calorimeters , where the biased nis tunnel junctions can also be used for precision thermometry down to milli - kelvin temperatures @xcite .",
    "an important physical phenomenon controlling the cooling power is the heat transfer between electrons and phonons mediated by their coupling , @xmath3 , when phonons are emitted and absorbed by electrons .",
    "when electrons are heated by an external source in a stationary regime one can assume their energy distribution to be characterized by a temperature @xmath4 while the distribution of phonons corresponds to some lower temperature @xmath5 in many situations the temperature gradients are sufficiently small so that we also assume that space variation of @xmath4 and @xmath6 can be neglected .",
    "when both subsystems are bulklike ( three - dimensional ) the rate @xmath7 at which electron energy is transferred to phonons has been obtained by considering the deformation - potential mechanism of electron - phonon coupling , which relates the local density fluctuation to the variation of the fermi energy @xcite , and @xmath8 has been shown to vary as @xmath9 at low temperatures ( see , e.g. , @xcite):@xmath10here @xmath11 is the volume of the metal and @xmath12 depends on the electron - phonon coupling and other properties of the sample .",
    "this form has been derived for simple metals in the case when disorder is not strong ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the phonon wave vector and @xmath15 is the electron mean free path ) and which is also assumed in the present work .",
    "it should be mentioned that for disordered films a form with a stronger ( @xmath16 ) low - temperature behavior has been found @xcite .",
    "the dependence in eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) was confirmed in many experimental situations and is a standard formula assumed for the analysis of experimental data , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the finite thickness of a film @xmath17 eliminates the possibility of longer waves to propagate in this direction .",
    "consequently , when temperatures fall below the dimensional crossover threshold @xmath0 @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the sound velocity , the wavelength of the thermally relevant phonons becomes longer than @xmath17 and we may treat the phonon subsystem in terms of a confined elastic medium . respectively , thermal properties , including the electron - phonon heat transfer , are dominated by the vibrational eigenmodes corresponding to such a quasi - two - dimensional geometry . for values of @xmath17 of the order of 100 nm and for sound velocities of the order of 10 km / s ,",
    "the value of @xmath20 is of the order of 1 k. therefore size related effects in electron - phonon systems have become an important part of the physics at the nanoscale , e.g. , stroscio , cleland . in a number of experimental studies",
    "it has been found that the temperature dependence is best represented by the @xmath21 with significantly lower values of @xmath22 @xcite . on the other hand , a theoretical investigation of the surface effects for a half - space geometry @xcite , including the surface specific rayleigh phonon modes ,",
    "has shown that the value of @xmath22 is actually larger than @xmath23 and at sufficiently low temperatures it exceeds @xmath24 . nevertheless , the growth of the exponential @xmath22 with decreasing temperature has been later qualitatively confirmed in some experiments when metallic films were deposited on bulky substrates @xcite . for a quasi - one - dimensional geometry ( metallic nanowire )",
    "the model has been studied theoretically in @xcite where the @xmath25 analog of eq .",
    "( power ) has been obtained .",
    "although in @xcite it was argued that for al nanowires with 65@xmath2690-nm cross - section a better fit is achieved with the standard exponential @xmath27 the results are still inconclusive since no dimensional crossover was observed around the anticipated temperature , 0.45 k. in contrast , a clear indication of a quasi - two - dimensional crossover in electron - phonon dominated heat flow with a distinct power law ( @xmath28 ) has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . remarkably , the respective samples had also a strongly enhanced density of the heat flux compared to the thicker samples , which remained in the bulk  regime and did not show a crossover behavior for the considered temperature interval .",
    "typically , the metallic film is either deposited on an insulating membrane , fig.[fig1 ] , or suspended on top of superconducting electrodes @xcite .     covered with a metal film ( gray ) of thickness @xmath29 and surface area @xmath30.,width=287,height=234 ]",
    "the phonon spectrum of a quasi - two - dimensional system is quite different from that of a bulk .",
    "vibrational eigenstates of such a slablike structure can not be separated into longitudinal and transverse waves ; instead in the elastic continuum approximation the spectrum is given by the lamb eigenmodes ( in addition to shear waves ) actually representing a mixture of both auld .",
    "the electron scattering by lamb phonon modes has been studied earlier for semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) in @xcite , stroscio and in a double heterostructure qw including the piezoelectric coupling in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the scattering rate @xmath31 is dominated by coupling to the flexural acoustic mode ( e.g. , @xmath32 ) due to its characteristic quadratic dispersion and high density of states , in contrast to the standard  linear dispersion of the , e.g. , dilatational lamb mode , which has a negligible contribution ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) . in the present work the electron excitations in the metal film",
    "are treated as a three - dimensional fermi gas interacting with the quasi - two - dimensional phonon subsystem .",
    "thus , electrons are described by the parabolic dispersion with an effective electron mass @xmath34 [ notations for the components of the wave vector @xmath35 correspond to fig.[fig1 ] ] and a plane - wave function @xmath36 where the electronic volume is @xmath37 and @xmath38 is given in the next section .",
    "we will use alternatively either the cylindrical coordinate system with @xmath39 normal to the film and the in - plane vector @xmath40 at angle @xmath41 , or the spherical system with the two angles denoted as @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it should be mentioned that in ultrathin metal films electron confinement can result in the formation of the quantum well state with @xmath38 @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where the quantum numbers @xmath47 correspond to the electron quasi - two - dimensional energy sub - bands .",
    "however , in contrast to semiconductors , the qw state is more difficult to observe in metal films thicker than a few nm ( e.g. , @xcite ) , because the electron de broglie wavelength is comparable to the interatomic distance and signatures of size quantization are easily smeared out by film imperfections of the same length scale , e.g. , surface roughness .",
    "thus , the plane - wave form of @xmath38 is an approximation , which is meant to describe the situation of a not very thin film where electron band structure can still be viewed as bulklike , while the phonon spectrum is dominated by quasi - two - dimensional modes .",
    "an important distinctive feature of this situation is that , although the phonons propagate parallel to the plane of the film , they can nevertheless produce electron scattering with a change of momentum in the direction normal to the plane , i.e. , @xmath48 this paradox is due to the displacement field pattern characteristic of the lamb waves ( see below ) which allows electrons to couple both to longitudinal ( in - plane ) and transverse ( out - of -plane ) components of the vibrations ( see also the discussion in @xcite for the case of a nanowire ) .",
    "the effect pertains primarily to the flexural modes and leads to a non - trivial modification of the heat transfer .    in an often used experimental setup",
    "the metallic strip is in contact with an insulating support membrane which can modify both the phonon spectrum and the flow of the heat produced in the metal and transmitted through the boundaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the boundary can give rise to interface guided stoneley phonon modes@xcite .",
    "however , for a solid - solid boundary the conditions on the parameters of the media ( densities and sound velocities ) required for the existence of stoneley modes are very restrictive ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we return to this issue in the next chapter .",
    "the heat transfer can also depend on the coupling of phonons in the film to their own bath ; e.g. , in @xcite it has been found that the distribution of phonons available for interaction with electrons in metal films can remain relatively unaffected by the substrate . in general , due to a mismatch of properties on the interface between two materials the phonons will scatter and produce a thermal boundary resistance ; the associated kapitza heat flow then depends on the difference of phonon temperatures of the two materials and is usually given by @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "there are other effects that can contribute to the heat transport , e.g. , related to the operational principle of electron microcoolers , when there exists a heat backflow from the superconductor to the metal island heik .",
    "below we will consider the heat flux derived from the electron - phonon coupling for the structure shown in fig.[fig1 ] by first assuming homogeneous elastic properties of the compound slab of volume @xmath50 @xcite , its total mass @xmath51 and mass density @xmath52 .",
    "the case of a suspended metallic film corresponds to the condition @xmath53 . to account for the modification of the phonon spectrum when the metal film is deposited on the insulating membrane with acoustic characteristics different from the metal , one can consider different models of their bonding ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , however we assume that the contact between the two media is rigid .",
    "it should be stressed that knowledge of the phonon spectrum is not sufficient when considering the coupling to electrons and one should also determine the properly normalized amplitudes of the phonon field .",
    "we define the rectangular coordinate system in such a way that @xmath54 corresponds to the top and bottom surfaces of the slab .",
    "elastic vibrations are described by the vector field of relative displacements @xmath55 @xcite expanded in the series of quantized eigenmodes of the continuum elasticity equation for the vibrations of a rectangular plate @xcite:@xmath56 \\mathbf{w}_{\\eta } ( \\mathbf{q}_{||},z)\\exp \\left ( i\\mathbf{q}_{||}\\mathbf{r}_{||}\\right ) .",

    "the quantum amplitudes @xmath65 are orthonormalized over the thickness @xmath17@xmath66the deformation potential coupling ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 is the fermi energy ; see also the discussion for cu in @xcite ) is then determined by the divergence of the displacement vector and takes the following form in the second quantization:@xmath69 .",

    "the coordinate system is oriented in the plane as shown in fig.[fig1 ] so that we choose @xmath22 to correspond to the propagation direction of the wave @xmath75 then from the displacement patterns of the three eigenmodes , @xmath76 and @xmath77 one can easily see that only the @xmath29 and @xmath64 modes couple to electrons .",
    "we further the mode index whenever this does not cause confusion and then the amplitudes resulting from the solutions of the elasticity equations for the free surface boundary conditions can be represented as follows ( see refs .",

    "( [ 28a ] ) and ( [ 28b ] ) .",
    "the temperature regime covered by the present analysis corresponds to low temperatures when the phonon spectrum is dominated by quasi - two - dimensional modes of vibration .",
    "the long - wavelength approximation which considers only the lowest phonon branches is well justified at lower temperatures and has allowed us to carry out the calculations analytically .",
    "thus , for the specific example considered above , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , this description corresponds to temperatures below  @xmath214 k while the quasi - two - dimensional regime sets in around  0.4 - 0.5 k @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the contributions of the flexural and dilatational phonon modes to the heat flux are of the same order of magnitude , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    for a suspended metallic film , @xmath169 ,",
    "the heat current follows a @xmath215 dependence , i.e. , @xmath216 , which appears to fit the pattern  of the dimensionality dependence including the integer power @xmath22 in the @xmath21 temperature variation , namely , when the phonon subsystem corresponds to either a three - dimensional bulk material with the power index @xmath217 as in eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) , or to a two - dimensional or quasi - two - dimensional material such as a single or bilayer graphene @xcite with @xmath218 , or to a quasi - one - dimesnional nanowire @xcite with @xmath219 .",
    "however , this result could seem surprising in the context of previous works on some other quasi - two - dimensional systems , e.g. , @xcite , for the case of a semiconductor quantum well , which would rather suggest a fractional value of @xmath22 due to the peculiar quadratic dispersion of the flexural mode .",
    "fractional power , @xmath220 , was also reported for the flexural modes contribution to electrical resistivity in free - standing graphene @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath218 for the heat flux in graphene is actually due to electron coupling with the dilatational phonons , since the troublesome  flexural ones couple to electrons only in second order in the displacement and can be disregarded for the graphene on a substrate as well @xcite . moreover",
    ", essentially different contributions of the phonon modes could be expected to result not only from the linearity and non - linearity of the respective dispersion laws , but also from the explicit presence of the size ( thickness @xmath17 ) dependence in the dispersion of the flexural mode [ e.g. , compare @xmath221 and @xmath222 in eqs .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) ] .",
    "indeed , in the studies on phonon transport and phonon heat capacity of a free - standing dielectric membrane @xcite a striking difference between the thickness dependent and non - dependent behavior has been derived for the two types of vibration .",
    "in contrast , for the electron - phonon heat transfer we find a comparable contribution for the two modes even when the metallic film is deposited on an insulating membrane ( @xmath180 ) , when the effect of sample geometry on the power @xmath7 is more complicated than a simple scaling with surface area @xmath30 [ see , e.g. , eqs .",
    "( [ fg_s ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) for the acoustically uniform sample ] . as we have shown such unexpected relative similarity in the temperature and size ( e.g. , thickness ) dependence results from several physical factors , so that their combination differs from the cases studied earlier . for",
    "a coupled electron - phonon system both the dispersions and the amplitudes of the excitations play an important role . respectively , a proper normalization of the amplitudes is crucial .",
    "one can then see , e.g. , from eqs .",
    "( [ 8a ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , that the normalization of the phonon modes in eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , containing the multipliers @xmath223 and the auxiliary parameters @xmath224 , moderates to some extent the sharp differences between the @xmath29 and @xmath64 dispersions .",
    "it is also clear that this compensation  depends on specific quantity considered , which in our case is the heat flux . unlike the case of graphene or that of a semiconductor quantum well , the electron excitations are described in terms of three - dimensional fermi gas with parabolic dispersion . respectively , the overlap of the electronic amplitudes in the initial and scattered states [ eq .",
    "( [ 9b ] ) ] is also a physical factor which differs from the models considered before .",
    "as discussed in the text , this overlap strongly discriminates between the @xmath29 and @xmath64 phonons and contributes to the above - mentioned compensation  as well .",
    "for the case of a metallic film deposited on an insulating membrane the flexural mode contribution to the power density of the electron - phonon heat transfer acquires an additional logarithmic term of the form @xmath225 [ eq .",
    "( [ 28b ] ) ] , while that of dilatational modes keeps the @xmath226 dependence [ eq .",
    "( [ 28a ] ) ] .",
    "as we have shown , such functional dependence reproduces well the observed behavior , which was modeled in @xcite with a power law @xmath21 with @xmath28 .",
    "the dependence on the material parameters for a metallic film with dielectric backing becomes more complicated , especially for the acoustically non - uniform case .",
    "this point can be illustrated by a more detailed analysis of the experimental work cited above .",
    "thus , one generally expects that reducing the dimensionality would enhance the electron - phonon heat exchange .",
    "this is confirmed by figs . 2 and 4 in @xcite for sufficiently thick samples to be considered bulklike ( e.g. , @xmath227 and @xmath228 ) and which show a much lower power density @xmath181 ( @xmath229 ) than the thinner samples ( like @xmath198 and @xmath199 discussed earlier , with @xmath199 being thicker than @xmath198 ) .",
    "moreover , if the simple surface area scaling of the power function ( @xmath230 ) would be valid for these thinner samples , then one would expect that @xmath231 .",
    "however , the power density for the thicker of the two ( @xmath199 ) is larger than for the thinner one ( @xmath198 ) in the considered temperature region .",
    "this non - trivial dependence on the material parameters is well reproduced by the analytical expressions .",
    "thus , the present analysis demonstrates that in thin metal films both types of lamb s phonon modes should be taken into account on equal footing for a better understanding of the electron - phonon heat transfer at low temperatures .",
