    "one of the most basic models of evolution in finite populations is the moran process @xcite . in the moran process , a population consisting of two types , a mutant type and a wild type , is continually updated via a birth - death process until only one type remains .",
    "the mutant and wild types are distinguished by only their reproductive fitness , which is assumed to be an intrinsic property of a player .",
    "a mutant type has fitness @xmath0 relative to the wild type ( whose fitness relative to itself is @xmath1 ) , and in each step of the process an individual is selected for reproduction with probability proportional to fitness .",
    "reproduction is clonal , and the offspring of a reproducing individual replaces another member of the population who is chosen for death uniformly at random .",
    "eventually , this population will end up in one of the monomorphic absorbing states : all mutant type or all wild type . in this context , a fundamental metric of the success of the mutant type is its ability to invade and replace a population of wild - type individuals @xcite .    in a population of size @xmath2 ,",
    "the probability that a single mutant in a wild - type population will fixate in the moran process is    @xmath3    in this version of a birth - death process , the members of the population are distinguished by only their types ; in particular , there is no notion of spatial arrangement , i.e. the population is _ well - mixed_. @xcite extend the classical moran process to graph - structured populations , which are populations with links between the players that indicate who is a neighbor of whom . in this structured version of the moran process",
    ", reproduction happens with probability proportional to fitness , but the offspring of a reproducing individual can replace only a _",
    "neighbor _ of the parent .",
    "since individuals are now distinguished by both their types ( mutant or wild ) _ and _ locations within the population , a natural question is whether or not the fixation probability of a single mutant type depends on where this mutant appears in the population .",
    "@xcite show that this fixation probability is independent of the location of the mutant if everyone has the same number of neighbors , i.e. the graph is _ regular _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , remarkably , the fixation probability of a single mutant on a regular graph is the same as that of eq .",
    "( [ fpmoran])an observation first made in a special case by @xcite .",
    "this result , known as the isothermal theorem , is independent of the number of neighbors the players have ( i.e. the _ degree _ of the graph ) .",
    "the moran process is _ frequency - independent _ in the sense that the fitness of an individual is determined by type and is not influenced by the rest of the population .",
    "however , the moran model can be easily extended to account for frequency-_dependent _ fitness . a standard way in which to model frequency - dependence is through evolutionary games @xcite . in the classical setup ,",
    "each player in the population has one of two strategies , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and receives an aggregate payoff from interacting with the rest of the population .",
    "this aggregate payoff is usually calculated from a sequence of pairwise interactions whose payoffs are described by a payoff matrix of the form    @xmath6    each player s aggregate payoff is then translated into fitness and the strategies in the population are updated based on these fitness values . since a player s payoff depends on the strategies of the other players in the population , so does that player s fitness . traditionally , this population is assumed to be infinite , in which case the dynamics of the evolutionary game are governed deterministically by the replicator equation of @xcite .",
    "more recently , evolutionary games have been considered in finite populations @xcite , where the dynamics are no longer deterministic but rather stochastic . in order to restrict who interacts with whom in the population",
    ", these populations can also be given structure .",
    "popular types of structured populations are graphs @xcite , sets @xcite , and demes @xcite .",
    "we focus here on evolutionary games in graph - structured populations that proceed in discrete time steps .",
    "such processes define discrete - time markov chains , either with or without absorbing states ( depending on mutation rates ) .",
    "typically , in evolutionary game theory , one starts with a population of players and repeatedly updates the population based on some update rule such as birth - death @xcite , death - birth @xcite , imitation @xcite , pairwise comparison @xcite , or wright - fisher @xcite .",
    "these update rules can be split into two classes : cultural and genetic ( see * ? ? ?",
    "cultural update rules involve strategy imitation while genetic update rules involve reproduction and inheritance . without mutations ,",
    "an update rule may be seen as giving a probability distribution over a number of strategy - acquisition scenarios : a player inherits a new strategy through imitation ( cultural rules ) or is born with a strategy determined by the parent(s ) ( genetic rules ) .",
    "mutation rates disrupt these scenarios by placing a small probability of a player taking on a novel strategy .",
    "the way in which strategy mutation rates are incorporated into an evolutionary process depends on both the class of the update rule and the specifics of the update rule itself . in a general sense",
    ", we say that strategy mutations are _ homogeneous _ if they depend on neither the players themselves nor the locations of the players .",
    "this notion of homogeneous strategy mutations is analogous to that of a symmetric game , which is a game for which the payoffs depend on the strategies played but are independent of the identities and locations of the players .",
    "the isothermal theorem seems to indicate that populations structured by regular graphs possess a significant degree of homogeneity , meaning that different locations within the population appear to be equivalent for the purposes of evolutionary dynamics .",
    "however , it is important to note that ( i ) fixation probability is just one metric of evolutionary success and ( ii ) the moran process is only one example of an evolutionary process .",
    "for example , in addition to the probability of fixation , one could look at the _ absorption time _ , which is the average number of steps until one of the monomorphic absorbing states is reached .",
    "moreover , one could consider frequency - dependent processes , possibly with different update rules , in which fitness is no longer an intrinsic property of an individual but is also influenced by the other members of the population .",
    "we show that the isothermal theorem does not extend to arbitrary frequency - dependent processes such as evolutionary games .",
    "furthermore , we show that this theorem does not apply to fixation _ times _ ; that is , even for the moran process on a regular graph , the average number of updates until a monomorphic absorbing state is reached can depend on the initial placement of the mutant .",
    "given that the isothermal theorem does not extend to other processes defined on regular graphs , the next natural question is the following : what is the meaning of a spatially - homogeneous population in evolutionary game theory ?",
    "in fact , we argue using asymmetric games @xcite that the term  homogeneous \" should apply to an evolutionary process _ as a whole _ rather than to just the population structure . even for populations that appear to be spatially homogeneous , such as populations on complete graphs , non - uniform distribution of resources within the population can result in heterogeneity of the overall process .",
    "similarly , for symmetric games , heterogeneity can be introduced into the dynamics of an evolutionary process through strategy mutations .",
    "therefore , a notion of homogeneity of an evolutionary game should take into account _ at least _",
    "( i ) population structure , ( ii ) payoffs , and ( iii ) strategy mutations .",
    "if the strategy - mutation rates are miniscule , then the population spends most of its time in monomorphic states . with small mutation rates",
    ", one can define an embedded markov chain on the monomorphic states and use this chain to study the success of each strategy @xcite .",
    "that is , when a mutation occurs , the population is assumed to return to a monomorphic state before another mutant arises .",
    "thus , the states of interest are the monomorphic states and the states consisting of a single mutant in an otherwise - monomorphic population .",
    "we say that an evolutionary game is _ homogeneous _ if any two states consisting of a single mutant ( @xmath4-player ) in wild - type population ( @xmath5-players ) are mathematically equivalent .",
    "we make precise what we mean by  mathematically equivalent \" in  [ sec : markov ] , but , informally , this equivalence means that any two such states are the same up to relabeling .",
    "in particular , _ all _ metrics such as fixation probability , absorption time , etc .",
    "are the same for any two states consisting of a single @xmath4-mutant in a @xmath5-population .",
    "we show that an evolutionary game in a graph - structured population is homogeneous if the graph is vertex - transitive (  looks the same \" from each vertex ) , the payoffs are symmetric , and the strategy mutations are homogeneous .",
    "this result holds for any update rule and selection intensity .",
    "finally , we explore the effects of population structure on asymmetric evolutionary games . in the weak selection limit",
    ", we show that asymmetric matrix games with homogeneous strategy mutations can be reduced to symmetric games if the population structure is arc - transitive (  looks the same \" from each edge in the graph ) .",
    "this result is a finite - population analogue of the main result of @xcite , which states that a similar reduction to symmetric games is possible in sufficiently large populations .",
    "thus , we establish that this reduction applies to any population size if the graph possesses a sufficiently high degree of symmetry .",
    "our explorations , both for symmetric and asymmetric games , clearly demonstrate the effects of population structure , payoffs , and strategy mutations on symmetries in evolutionary games .",
    "the evolutionary processes we consider here define discrete - time markov chains on finite state spaces .",
    "the notions of symmetry and evolutionary equivalence that we aim to introduce for evolutionary processes can actually be stated quite succinctly at the level of the markov chain .",
    "we first work with general markov chains , and later we apply these ideas to evolutionary games .",
    "[ def : symmetry ] suppose that @xmath7 is a markov chain on a ( finite ) state space , @xmath8 , with transition matrix @xmath9 .",

    "two states @xmath13 are said to be _ symmetric _ if there exists @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .    definition [ def : symmetry ] says that the states of the chain can be relabeled in such a way that the transition probabilities are preserved .",
    "this relabeling may affect the long - run distribution of the chain since it need not fix absorbing states , so we make one further refinement in order to ensure that if two states are symmetric , then they behave in the same way :    [ def : evolutionaryequivalence ] states @xmath16 and @xmath17 are _ evolutionarily equivalent _ if there exists an automorphism of the markov chain , @xmath14 , such that    1 .   @xmath15 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath18 is a stationary distribution of @xmath10 , then @xmath19 .    for a markov chain with absorbing states , the notions of symmetry and evolutionary equivalence of states need not coincide ( see example [ ex : swapstrategies ] of appendix b )",
    ". however , if the markov chain has a unique stationary distribution ( as would be the case if it were irreducible ) , then symmetry implies evolutionary equivalence :    [ prop : ergodicsymmetry ] if @xmath10 has a unique stationary distribution , then two states are symmetric if and only if they are evolutionarily equivalent .",
    "we show in appendix b that a markov chain symmetry preserves the set of stationary distributions ( lemma [ lem : stationarydistribution ] ) , so if there is a unique stationary distribution , then condition ( ii ) of definition [ def : evolutionaryequivalence ] is satisfied automatically by any symmetry .",
    "proposition [ prop : ergodicsymmetry ] is then an immediate consequence of this result .",
    "if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are evolutionarily equivalent , then it is clear for absorbing processes that the probability that @xmath16 fixates in absorbing state @xmath20 is the same as the probability that @xmath17 fixates in state @xmath20 ( and similarly for fixation times ) .",
    "if the process has a unique stationary distribution , then the symmetry of @xmath16 and @xmath17 implies that this distribution puts the same mass on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these properties follow at once from the fact that the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 are equivalent up to relabeling .",

    "we consider evolutionary games in graph - structured populations .",

    "a directed graph is one in which the edges have orientations , meaning there may be an edge from @xmath26 to @xmath28 but not from @xmath28 to @xmath26 . moreover , the edges carry weights , which we assume are nonnegative real numbers .",

    "every graph considered here is assumed to be connected ( strongly ) , which means that for any two vertices , @xmath26 and @xmath28 , there is a ( directed ) path from @xmath26 to @xmath28 .",
    "this assumption is not that restrictive in evolutionary game theory since one can always partition a graph into its strongly - connected components and study the behavior of an evolutionary process on each of these components .",

    "it follows from corollary [ cor : spatialaverage ] that asymmetric matrix games on arc - transitive ( symmetric ) graphs can be reduced to symmetric games in the limit of weak selection .",
    "evolutionary games in finite populations may be split into two classes : those with absorbing states (  absorbing processes \" ) and those without absorbing states . in absorbing processes ,",
    "the notion of fixation probability has played a crucial role in quantifying evolutionary outcomes , but fixation probabilities are far from the only measure of evolutionary success .",
    "much of the literature on evolutionary games with absorbing states has neglected other metrics such as the time to absorption or the time to fixation conditioned on fixation occurring (  conditional fixation time \" ) .",
    "this bias toward fixation probabilities has resulted in certain evolutionary processes appearing more symmetric than they actually are .",
    "we have illustrated this phenomenon using the frequency - independent moran process on graphs : the isothermal theorem guarantees that , on regular graphs , a single mutant can not distinguish between initial locations in the graph if the only metric under consideration is the probability of fixation .",
    "however , certain initial placements of the mutant may result in faster absorption times than others if the graph is regular but not vertex - transitive , and the frucht graph exemplifies this claim .",
    "the same phenomenon also holds for conditional fixation times .",
    "the frucht graph , which is a regular structure with no nontrivial symmetries ( there are no two vertices from which the graph",
    " looks \" the same ) , also allowed us to show that the isothermal theorem of @xcite does not extend to frequency - dependent evolutionary games .",
    "that is , on regular graphs , the probability of fixation of a single mutant may depend on the initial location of the mutant if fitness is frequency - dependent .",
    "this claim was illustrated via a death - birth process on the frucht graph , in which the underlying evolutionary game was a snowdrift game .",
    "for @xmath53 ( strong selection ) , the fixation probability of a cooperator at vertex @xmath152 was nearly @xmath153 larger than the fixation probability of a cooperator at vertex @xmath154 .",
    "moreover , we showed that if the fixation probabilities of two initial configurations differ for a single value of @xmath54 , then they are the same for at most finitely many values of @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , these fixation probabilities differ for almost every selection strength , so our observation for @xmath53 was not an anomaly .",
    "similar phenomena are observed for frequency - dependent birth - death processes on the frucht graph , for example , and even for frequency - dependent games with the  equal gains from switching \" property , such as the donation game .",
    "theorem [ thm : mainsymmetrictheorem ] is an analogue of the isothermal theorem that applies to a broader class of games and update rules . the isothermal theorem is remarkable since regularity of the population structure implies that the fixation probabilities are not only independent of the initial location of the mutant , they are the _ same _ as those of the classical moran process . our treatment of homogeneous evolutionary processes is focused on when different single - mutant states are equivalent , not when they are equivalent to the corresponding states in the classical moran process . even if the fixation probability of a single mutant does not depend on",
    "the mutant s location , other factors ( such as birth and death rates ) may affect whether or not this fixation probability is the same as the one in a well - mixed population @xcite .",
    "remark [ remark : transitivesymmetric ] , which compares the fixation probabilities for the snowdrift game on two different vertex - transitive graphs of the same size and degree , shows that the fixation probability of a single mutant  even if independent of the mutant s location  can depend on the configuration of the graph . in light of these results , the symmetry phenomena for the moran process guaranteed by the isothermal theorem do not generalize and should be thought of as properties of the frequency - independent moran process and not of evolutionary processes in general .",
    "theorem [ thm : mainsymmetrictheorem ] , and indeed most of our discussion of homogeneity , focused on symmetries of states consisting of just a _ single _ mutant . in many cases ,",
    "mutation rates are sufficiently small that a mutant type , when it appears , will either fixate or go extinct before another mutation occurs @xcite .",
    "thus , with small mutation rates , one need not consider symmetries of states consisting of more than one mutant . however ,",
    "if mutation rates are larger , then these multi - mutant states become relevant .",
    "our definition of evolutionary equivalence ( definition [ def : evolutionaryequivalence ] ) applies to these states , but , as expected , the symmetry conditions on the population structure guaranteeing any two multi - mutant states are equivalent are much stronger .",
    "in fact , as we argued in ",
    "[ subsubsec : homogeneousevolutionarygames ] , the population must in general be well - mixed even for any pair of states consisting of _ two _ mutants to be evolutionarily equivalent .",
    "consequently , our focus on single - mutant states allowed us to simultaneously treat biologically relevant configurations ( assuming mutation rates are small ) and obtain non - trivial conditions guaranteeing homogeneity of an evolutionary process .    the counterexamples presented here could be defined on sufficiently small population structures , and thus all calculations ( fixation probabilities , structure coefficients , etc . ) are exact .",
    "however , these quantities need not always be explicitly calculated in order to prove useful : in our study of asymmetric games , we concluded that an asymmetric game on an arc - transitive ( symmetric ) graph can be reduced to a symmetric game in the limit of weak selection .",

    "this term has been used to describe well - mixed populations @xcite . for graph - structured populations ,  homogeneous graph \" sometimes refers to vertex - transitive graphs @xcite . in algebraic graph theory , however , the term  homogeneous graph \" implies a much higher degree of symmetry than does than vertex - transitivity ( see * ? ? ?",
    " homogeneous \" has also been used to describe graphs in which each vertex has the same number of neighbors , i.e. regular graphs @xcite . in between regular and vertex - transitive graphs ,  homogeneous graph \" has also referred to large , random regular graphs @xcite .",
    "as we noted , large , random regular graphs approximate bethe lattices ( which are infinite , arc - transitive graphs ) , but these approximations need not themselves be even vertex - transitive .    in many of the various uses of the term  homogeneous , \" a common aim is to study the fixation probability of a randomly placed mutant . our definition of _ homogeneous evolutionary game",

    "we also demonstrated the effects of payoffs and strategy mutations on the behavior of these single - mutant states and concluded that the term homogeneous should apply to the entire process rather than to just the population structure .",
    "the homogeneity ( theorem [ thm : mainsymmetrictheorem ] ) and symmetry ( theorem [ thm : mainasymmetrictheorem ] ) results given here do not depend on the update rule , in contrast with results such as the symmetry of conditional fixation times in the moran process of @xcite or the isothermal theorem of @xcite .",

    "@xmath34 , written @xmath208 , is the set of all @xmath89 such that @xmath101 .",
    "we now recall a condition slightly stronger than regularity known as vertex - transitivity :    [ def : vertextransitivegraph ] @xmath34 is _ vertex - transitive _ if for each @xmath26 and @xmath28 , there exists @xmath209 such that @xmath104 .",
    "informally , a graph is vertex - transitive if and only if it  looks the same \" from every vertex .",
    "if a graph is vertex - transitive , then it is necessarily regular .",
    "the strongest form of symmetry for graphs that we consider here is the following :    [ def : symmetricgraph ] @xmath34 is _ symmetric _ ( or _ arc - transitive _ ) if for each @xmath210 with @xmath35 and @xmath211 with @xmath212 , there exists @xmath209 such that @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",

    "in contrast to example [ ex : swapstrategies ] , processes with unique stationary distributions have the property that every symmetry of the markov chain is an evolutionary equivalence ( proposition [ prop : ergodicsymmetry ] ) .",
