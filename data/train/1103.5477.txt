    "the first generation of stars in the universe ( known as population iii stars ) are the earliest objects to form from the collapse of pristine gas .",
    "there is so far no direct observational evidence for their existence or properties , but simulations @xcite suggest that they are likely to form with a top - heavy initial mass distribution , with a much heavier average mass than current stars , in the range @xmath0 , although models with smaller masses are also possible , e.g. @xcite .",
    "such hypermassive stars have very short life times , and except for a limited intermediate mass range , they undergo a core collapse leading to a black hole whose mass is some fraction of the initial stellar mass , depending on how much mass loss occurred during the brief stellar evolution . for sufficiently fast rotating cores , accretion of remnant gas onto the black hole can lead to the formation of a powerful jet , resulting in a gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , e.g. @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss a specific scenario where the grb jet is initially dominated by magnetic energy ( an mhd jet ) @xcite .",
    "a very large energy output can be realized in the jet , leading to shocks which can accelerate protons to highly relativistic energies , leading to significant neutrino emission via the photomeson process in the presence of the accompanying large photon luminosity .",
    "although difficult to observe , these neutrinos propagate almost absorption - free across cosmological distances , and can provide valuable information about cosmic conditions during the reionization epoch , when the first structures formed .    in this paper",

    "in the very massive @xmath0 population iii star scenario , aside from the approximate @xmath1 range leading to pair instability supernovae which leave no remnant @xcite , the core collapse results in a massive black hole ( bh ) of mass @xmath2 encompassing a substantial portion of the original mass .",
    "a fraction of these are expected to be fast rotating @xcite , one of the requirements for grb progenitors . for a star of initial radius @xmath3 , infall of the remnant stellar gas onto the black hole",

    "<S> we discuss the high energy neutrino emission from gamma - ray bursts resulting from the earliest generation ( ` population iii ' ) stars forming in the universe , whose core collapses into a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> these gamma - ray bursts are expected to produce a highly relativistic , magnetically dominated jet , where protons can be accelerated to ultra - high energies . </S>",
    "<S> these interact with the photons produced by the jet , leading to ultra - high energy photo - meson neutrinos as well as secondary leptons and photons . </S>",
    "<S> the photon luminosity and the shock properties , and thus the neutrino spectrum , depend on the mass of the black holes as well as on the density of the surrounding external gas . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the individual source neutrino spectral fluxes and the expected diffuse neutrino flux for various source parameters and evolution scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> both the individual and diffuse signals appear detectable in the 1 - 300 pev range with current and planned neutrino detectors such as icecube and arianna , provided the black hole mass is in excess of 30 - 100 solar masses . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a possible test for the debated mass of the progenitor stellar objects , as well as a probe for the early cosmological environment and the formation rate of the earliest structures . </S>"
