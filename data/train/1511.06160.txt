    "stellar rotation is one of the fundamental processes governing stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the internal structure of a star at a given phase of its life is strongly affected by the angular momentum transport history .",
    "investigating the internal rotational profile of a star and reconstructing its evolution with time become crucial in achieving basic constraints on the angular momentum transport mechanisms acting in the stellar interior during different phases of its evolution .",
    "in particular , physical processes that affect rotation and in turn are affected by rotation , such as convection , turbulent viscosity , meridional circulation , mixing of elements , internal gravity waves , dynamos and magnetism , are at present not well understood and modeled with limited success ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    until fairly recently",
    ", rotation inside stars has been a largely unexplored field of research from an observational point of view . over",
    "the past two decades helioseismology changed this scenario , making it possible to measure the rotation profile in the sun s interior through the measurement of the splittings of the oscillation frequencies , revealing a picture of the solar internal dynamics very different from previous theoretical predictions ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "contrary to what one could expect from the angular momentum conservation theory , predicting a sun with a core rotating much faster than the surface when only meridional circulation and classical hydrodynamic instabilities are invoked ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , helioseismology shows an almost uniform rotation in the radiative interior and an angular velocity monotonically decreasing from the equator to high latitudes in the convective envelope .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that several powerful processes act to redistribute angular momentum in the interior , like for example magnetic torquing ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and internal gravity waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    the rotation breaks the spherical symmetry of the stellar structure and splits the frequency of each oscillation mode of harmonic degree @xmath3 into @xmath4 components which appear as a multiplet in the power spectrum .",
    "multiplets with a fixed radial order @xmath5 and harmonic degree @xmath3 are said to exhibit a frequency `` splitting '' defined by : @xmath6 somewhat analogous to the zeeman effect on the degenerate energy levels of an atom , where @xmath7 is known as the azimuthal order . under the hypothesis that the rotation of the star is sufficiently slow ,",
    "so that effects of the centrifugal force can be neglected , the frequency separation between components of the multiplet is directly related to the angular velocity @xcite .    in recent years spectacular asteroseismic results on data provided by the space missions corot @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite have revolutionized the field . in particular , the _ kepler _ satellite has provided photometric time series of unprecedented quality , cadence and duration , supplying the basic conditions for studying the internal rotational profile and its temporal evolution in a large sample of stars , characterized by a wide range of masses and evolutionary stages .    in this context",
    "the detection of solar - like pulsations - as in the sun excited by turbulent convection - in thousands of red giants , from the bottom to the tip of the red - giants branch ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to the agb @xcite appears particularly exciting .",
    "red - giant stars are ideal asteroseismic targets for many reasons . compared to the main - sequence stars , solar - like oscillations in red giants are easier to detect due to their higher pulsation",
    "amplitudes @xcite .",
    "what is more important , red - giant frequency spectra reveal mixed modes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which probe not only the outer layers , where they behave like acoustic modes , but also the deep radiative interior , where they propagate as gravity waves . both the gravity and the acoustic - wave propagation zones contribute , in various proportions , to the formation of mixed modes .",
    "the greatest contribution from the acoustic zone occurs for modes with frequency near the resonant frequency of the acoustic cavity .",
    "mode inertias attain local minima at these frequencies .",
    "moreover , the red - giant phase represents a crucial step in the stellar angular momentum distribution history @xcite .",
    "when a star evolves off the relatively long and stable main sequence , its rotation starts evolving differently in the inner and outer parts causing the formation of a sharp rotation gradient in the intermediate regions where hydrogen is still burning : assuming that the angular momentum is locally conserved , the contraction of the core causes its rotation to speed up in a relatively short timescale , while the outer layers slow down due to their expansion .",
    "the accurate determination of the rotational profiles in subgiants and red giants provides information on the angular momentum transport mechanism potentially leading to significant improvements in the modeling of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "recently , results based on measurements of the rotational splittings of dipole mixed modes have been reported in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , based on high precision measurements of rotational splittings provided by _ kepler _ , found that the core in the red - giant stars is rotating faster than the upper layers .",
    "these results were confirmed by applying inversion techniques to rotational splittings by @xcite .",
    "asteroseismology of large sample of stars @xcite allowed to clarify that the mean core rotation significantly slows down as stars ascend the red - giant branch .",
    "several theoretical investigations have explored the consequences of these recent results on internal angular momentum transport inside solar - like oscillating stars along their evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results show that the internal rotation rates , predicted by current theoretical models of subgiants and red giants , are at least 10 times higher compared to observations , suggesting the need to investigate more efficient mechanisms of angular - momentum transport acting on the appropriate timescales during these phases of stellar evolution .    in this paper",
    "we analyze more than two years of _ kepler _ observations of the red - giant star kic  4448777 and identify 14 rotational splittings of mixed modes in order to characterize its internal rotational profile using different inversion techniques at first applied successfully to helioseismic data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and recently to data of more evolved stars @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 reports the results of the spectroscopic analysis of the star aimed at the determination of its atmospheric parameters .",
    "section 3 describes the method adopted to analyze the oscillation spectrum and identify the mode frequencies and the related splittings .",
    "section 4 provides the basic formalism for performing the inversion , starting from the observed splittings and models of the star .",
    "section 5 describes the evolutionary models constructed to best fit the atmospheric and asteroseismic constraints .",
    "section 6 presents the details of the asteroseismic inversion carried out to infer the rotational profile of the star . in section 7",
    "we test the inversion techniques for the case of red giants and the capability of detecting the presence of rotational gradient in the deep interior of the star . in section 8 the results obtained by the inversion techniques",
    "are compared with those obtained by other methods .",
    "section 9 summarizes the results and draws the conclusions .",
    "in order to properly characterize the star , six spectra of 1800 seconds integration time each were obtained with the hermes spectrograph @xcite , mounted on the 1.2-m mercator telescope at la palma . this highly efficient chelle spectrometer has a spectral resolution of r=86000 , covering a spectral range from 380 to 900 nm .",
    "the raw spectra were reduced with the instrument specific pipeline and then averaged to a master spectrum .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was around 135 in the range from 500 to 550 nm .",
    "the atmospheric parameter determination was based upon fe i and fe ii lines which are abundantly present in red - giant spectra .",
    "we used the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) kurucz - castelli atmosphere models @xcite combined with the lte abundance calculation routine moog ( version august 2010 ) by c. sneden .",
    "fe lines were identified using vald line lists @xcite . for a detailed description of the different steps needed for atmospheric parameter determination , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we selected fe lines in the highest signal - to - noise region of the master spectrum in the wavelength range between 500 and 680 nm .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) was calculated using direct integration and the abundance of each line was then computed by an iterative process where theoretically calculated ews were matched to observed ews . due to the high metallicity ,",
    "the spectrum of kic  4448777 displays many blended lines . to avoid these blended lines in our selected fe line lists , we first calculated the theoretical ew of all available fe i and fe ii lines in the wavelength range between 500 and 680 nm .",
    "the theoretical ews were then compared to the observed ews to detect any possible blends .",
    "the atmospheric stellar parameters derived by the spectroscopic analysis are reported in table  [ tab : parameters ] and are based upon the results from 46 fe i and 32 fe ii lines .",
    "ccccc @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 + [ tab : parameters ]    we have also explored the possibility to derive the surface rotation rate by following the method by @xcite , but we have not found any signatures of spot modulation as evidence for an on - going magnetic field .",
    "for the asteroseismic analysis we have used near - continuous photometric time series obtained by _ kepler _ in long - cadence mode ( time sampling of 29.4 min ) .",
    "this light curve spans about 25 months corresponding to observing quarters q0 - 9 , providing a formal frequency resolution of 15  nhz .",
    "we used the so - called pdc - sap ( pre data conditioning - simple aperture photometry ) light curve @xcite corrected for instrumental trends and discontinuities as described by @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of the light curve shows a clear power excess in the range @xmath13hz ( fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum ] ) due to radial modes , with the comb - like pattern typical of the solar - like p - mode oscillations , and non - radial modes , particularly those of spherical degree @xmath14 , modulated by the mixing with g modes .    ) are indicated .",

    "panel b ) shows observed rotational splittings for @xmath14 modes.,width=453 ]    the initial analysis of the spectrum was done using the pipeline described in @xcite . by this method we determined the frequency at maximum oscillation power @xmath15hz and the so - called large frequency separation between modes with the same harmonic degree @xmath16hz .",
    "the quoted uncertainties have been derived from analyzing 500 spectra generated by randomly perturbing the original spectrum , according to @xcite . for the purposes of this paper",
    "it has been necessary , also , to identify the individual modes and measure their frequencies .",
    "this process , known as `` peak bagging '' , is notoriously difficult to perform for red giants because of their complex frequency spectra , with modes of very different characteristics within narrow , sometimes even overlapping , frequency ranges .",
    "mixed modes of different inertia have very different damping times and hence also different profiles in the frequency spectrum . here",
    "we therefore used a combination of known methods tailored to our particular case , although we should mention that an automatic `` one - fits - all '' approach has been recently developed by @xcite .",
    "four independent groups ( simply called fitters ) performed the fitting of the modes by using slightly different approaches :    1 .",
    "the first team smoothed the power spectrum of the star to account for the intrinsic damping and reexcitation of the modes .",
    "they located the modes by two separate steps using a different level of smoothing in each .",
    "first , they heavily smoothed the power spectrum ( by 13 independent bins in frequency ) to detect the most damped modes including radial , quadrupole and dipole modes with lower inertia , and then they smoothed less ( by 7 bins ) to identify the dipole modes with higher inertia . in both cases",
    "the peaks were selected and associated with modes only if they were significant at the 99% level , setting the threshold according to the statistics for smoothed spectra , which takes into account the level of smoothing applied and the frequency range over which the modes have been searched ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , the ` toy model ' of @xcite was used to locate a few extra dipole modes .",
    "this fitting was performed using the mcmc bayesian method by @xcite ; 2 .",
    "the second team extracted the frequencies of individual modes as the centroid of the unsmoothed power spectral density ( psd ) in narrow predefined windows , checked for consistency by fitting lorentzian profiles to a number of modes @xcite ; 3 .",
    "the third team modelled the power spectrum with a sum of many lorentzians , performed a global fit using a maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) , and calculated the formal uncertainties from the inverse hessian matrix @xcite ; 4 .",
    "the fourth team derived proxies of the oscillation frequencies from a global fit based on global seismic parameters ; all peaks with a height - to - background ratio larger than 8 were selected ; radial modes and quadrupole modes were estimated from the fit of the large separation provided by the second - order asymptotic expansion for pressure modes @xcite ; the dipole modes were obtained with the asymptotic expansion for mixed modes @xcite with rotational splittings derived with the method of @xcite .",
    "the final set of 58 individual mode frequencies , including the multiplets due to rotation for the @xmath14 modes , consists only of those frequencies detected at least by two of the fitters .    in order to obtain statistically consistent uncertainties for the mode frequencies we used the bayesian markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) fitting algorithm by @xcite for the peak bagging .",
    "the algorithm allows simultaneous fitting of the stellar granulation signal @xcite and all oscillation modes , each represented by a lorentzian profile .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the frequency spectrum of kic  4448777 , we were not able to fit all modes simultaneously using a single method .",
    "in particular , the mixed modes with very high inertia and hence very long mode lifetimes have essentially undersampled frequency profiles in the spectrum .",
    "fitting lorentzian profiles to these modes is therefore unsuitable , and can easily lead the fitting algorithm astray .",
    "we therefore treated the radial and quadrupole modes separately from the dipole modes .",
    "the radial and quadrupole modes were fitted as lorentzian profiles using the mcmc approach . in this analysis we ignored any mixing of quadrupole modes and",
    "hence fit only one quadrupole mode per radial order .    for the dipole modes , which we were not able to fit as part of the mcmc method for the reasons explained above , we decided to adopt the initial frequencies , found from the smoothed spectrum by team 1 , as the final frequencies and the scatter among the four fitters as a proxy for uncertainties . as a sanity check for this approach we compared the uncertainties obtained by the mcmc fitting procedure of the radial modes with the scatter between different fitters of the same modes .",
    "we found that on average the ` fitter scatter ' is within 17% of the mcmc uncertainty , and all fitter scatter values are within a factor of two of the mcmc - derived uncertainty .    in the above analysis each dipole mode",
    "was detected separately , independently of the azimuthal order @xmath7 .",
    "as in @xcite , we noticed that the components with @xmath17 of a given triplet are not equally spaced from the central @xmath18 mode . in the framework of the perturbation theory ,",
    "the splitting asymmetries correspond to second - order effects in the oscillation frequency that mainly account for the distortion caused by the centrifugal force . here , the asymmetry is smaller in size and reasonably negligible , in first approximation , when compared to the rotational splitting itself , ranging from 0.3% to - at most - 12% ( with a mean value of 6% ) of the respective rotational splittings , with values comparable with the frequency uncertainties . in order to remove second order perturbation effects , here we used the generalized rotational splitting expression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath19 the relative uncertainties have been calculated according to the general propagation formula for indirect measurements .",
    "detailed investigation on the physical meaning of rotational splitting asymmetries and the possibility to derive from them more stringent constraints on the internal rotational profile of oscillating stars have been the subject of different papers ( cf .",
    "* ) , but it is beyond the aim of the present work .",
    "table  [ tab : frequencies ] lists the final set of frequencies together with their uncertainties , corresponding to the values obtained by the mcmc fitting procedure for radial and quadrupole modes and to the scatter in the results from the four fitters for dipole modes , their spherical degree and the rotational splittings for 14 dipole modes .    to measure the inclination of the star we used the above mcmc peak bagging algorithm , restricting the fit to the strongest dipole modes of @xmath18 and imposing equal spacing of the @xmath17 components .",
    "this calculation provided an inclination of @xmath20 .",
    "as in @xcite , the observed rotational splittings are not constant for consecutive dipole modes ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum]b showing rotational splittings for the @xmath14 modes ) .",
    "splittings are larger for modes with a higher inertia which predominately probe the inner radiative interior .",
    "this shows that the deep interior of the star is rotating faster than the outer layers .",
    "the identification of several dipole modes and the use of the method by @xcite , based on the asymptotic relation , allowed us to estimate the asymptotic period spacing @xmath21s , which places this star on the low luminosity red - giant branch in agreement with the evolutionary phase predicted by the value of the observed @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "a first estimate of the asteroseismic stellar mass and radius can be obtained from the observed @xmath22 and @xmath23 together with the value of @xmath24 @xcite . in particular , by using the scaling relation calibrated on solar values , we obtain @xmath25 and @xmath26 . by using the scaling relation by @xcite , calibrated on a large sample of observed solar - like stars ,",
    "we obtain @xmath27 and @xmath28 . from the above values we can determine the asteroseismic surface gravity be @xmath29  dex .",
    "this value is in good agreement with that determined by the spectroscopic analysis ( see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",

    "it seems fair to say that , at this stage , the asteroseismic inversions are giving very useful results to test the actual evolution theory of stellar structure , but we expect the ever - improving accuracy of the data will drive the theory to advance in new directions and eventually lead to a more thorough understanding of stellar rotation .",
    "considering the fact that the internal angular velocity of the core of the red giants is theoretically expected to be higher compared to our results , it remains still necessary to investigate more efficient mechanisms of angular momentum transport acting on the appropriate timescales during the different phases of the stellar evolution , before the red - giant phase .",
    "we expect that the measurements of rotational splittings for modes with low inertia will shed some light on the above picture and on the question of the stellar angular momentum transport . although some preliminary tests @xcite have shown that the use of @xmath123 modes splittings can not help to resolve internal rotation inside red giants , we believe that a detailed analysis is required by considering red giants at different evolutionary phases .    we conclude that it is reasonable to think that this approach , proved to be very powerful in the case of the sun , for which thousands of modes from low to high degree have been detected , can be well applied even to small sets of only dipolar modes in red - giant  stars .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the early red - giant star kic  4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of the dipole mixed modes obtained from _ kepler </S>",
    "<S> _ observations . in order to overcome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red - giant stars , we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods to extract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> we find not only that the core rotates faster than the surface , confirming previous inversion results generated for other red giants @xcite , but we also estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with a spatial resolution of @xmath0 and verify the hypothesis of a sharp discontinuity in the inner stellar rotation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity of about @xmath1  nhz and provide evidence for an angular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part of the hydrogen burning shell ; however we do not succeed to characterize the rotational slope , due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the angular velocity , from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burning shell , appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center , reaching an average value in the convective envelope of @xmath2  nhz . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the core in kic  4448777 is rotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficient to infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense core but also , with a lower level of confidence , in part of the radiative region and in the convective envelope . </S>"
