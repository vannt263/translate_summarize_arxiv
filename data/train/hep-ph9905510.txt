    "one of the main purposes of the lhc collider is to search for the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the direction of this search is to look for superpartners of ordinary particles expected in supersymmetric extensions of sm ( susy ) .",
    "susy , if it exists , is expected to reveal itself at lhc firstly via an excess of ( multilepton + ) multijet + e@xmath12 final states compared to standard model ( sm ) expectations @xcite .",
    "spectacular and revealing structures are also possible in @xmath13 spectra indicative of susy production @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a long time that susy production will be accompanied by an excess of b - jets , in part as @xmath14 and @xmath15 are expected to be the lightest among the squarks . recently @xcite it has also been shown that with increasing tan@xmath5 we should expect substantial increase of sparticle branching ratios to third generation particles due to increase of b and @xmath0 yukawa couplings .",
    "this implies a significant increase of the @xmath0 yield for large tan@xmath5 . both b s and",
    "@xmath0 s require a specific detection technique , relying mostly on precision measurements of impact parameters .",
    "the main goal of this study is to show the importance of good b - jet and tau detection in cms @xcite for susy measurements .",
    "the importance of b - tagging in @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 detection is discussed in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in evaluating the richness of b - production in susy , whose detection relies on microvertexing , and of @xmath0 production which requires calorimeter , tracker @xcite and microvertexing selection .",
    "more emphasis is given to @xmath0 production as less known and documented , especially at high tan@xmath5 , but b - production is more rewarding and instrumentally more demanding as it depends on a detection of several fairly soft ( @xmath6 1  5 gev / c ) tracks with significant impact parameters in a jetty environment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the specific susy model employed in section 2 .",
    "phenomenological differences of low and high tan@xmath5 values are briefly discussed in section 3 . then in section 4 the difference between various domains of @xmath19 , @xmath20 plane for the same tan@xmath5=35 is discussed .",
    "the msugra observations at high tan@xmath5 are somewhat generalized in case of the minimal extension of the sm ( mssm ) in section 5 .",
    "the main results of this study are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the large number of susy parameters , even in the minimal extension of the sm ( mssm ) , makes it difficult to comprehend the variety of possible signals and signatures and to evaluate the reach in various sparticle searches in general .",
    "so , to have a better grasp of the situation , we limit ourselves at present basically to the msugra - mssm model , except for some specific cases explicitly mentioned .",
    "this model emanates from the mssm , using grand unification theory ( gut ) assumptions to limit the number of parameters ( see more details in e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the msugra model contains only five free parameters @xmath21    * a common gaugino mass ( @xmath20 ) ; * a common scalar mass ( @xmath19 ) ; * a common trilinear interaction amongst the scalars ( @xmath22 ) ; * the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields that couple to @xmath23 and @xmath24 fermions ( tan@xmath5 ) ; * a higgsino mixing parameter @xmath25 which enters only through its sign ( @xmath26 ) .    for a given choice of model parameters all the masses and couplings , and thus production cross sections ( up to structure function ) and",
    "decay branching ratios are fixed .",
    "the mass of the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) which is @xmath27 in the r - parity conserving msugra equals approximately @xmath6 1/2 of the @xmath28 mass .",
    "the mass of lightest chargino @xmath29 is almost the same as that of the @xmath28 .",
    "isomass contours of @xmath30 and @xmath29 and gluino behave gaugino - like , i.e. depend mainly on @xmath20 .",
    "masses of sleptons and squarks depend on both @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ".    masses of squarks ( especially of the first generation ) , gluinos , charginos and neutralinos depend only weakly on tan@xmath5 , a@xmath31 or sign(@xmath25 ) parameters .",
    "masses of sleptons , stop and sbottom have some dependence on these msugra parameters , in particular third generation sparticles on tan@xmath5 ; masses of @xmath32 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 tend to be the lightest among the sleptons and squarks respectively with increasing tan@xmath5 .",
    "masses of higgs bosons depend significantly on tan@xmath5 , the mass of the lightest scalar higgs @xmath16 increases with tan@xmath5 and depends also on sign(@xmath25 ) , whilst masses of the heavy higgses decrease dramatically with increasing tan@xmath5 in this model @xcite .",
    "since masses and couplings , thus branchings and cross - sections vary most rapidly with m@xmath7 , m@xmath8 , it is natural to follow the commonly used way of presenting msugra searches as a function of these two parameters for different fixed values of tan@xmath5 and sign@xmath33 ) .",
    "the a@xmath7 parameter is usually set to zero , since its variation has only a moderate effect on the results .    in figs.1,2 one",
    "can see total msugra production cross - section ( including associated @xmath34 , @xmath35 and chargino - neutralino pair production ) as a function of m@xmath7 , m@xmath8 for chosen sets of tan@xmath5 and sign(@xmath25 ) . the contribution of strongly interacting susy particles cross - sections ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) is also shown separately by dashed lines .",
    "the jitter in the contours is caused by limited statistics .",
    "the total cross - section for the same values of m@xmath7 , m@xmath8 but for different values of tan@xmath5 and sign(@xmath25 ) differs slightly .",
    "the bulk of the total cross - section for low values of m@xmath8 comes from @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , whereas in the domains with extremely high masses of @xmath39 , @xmath40 the contribution of production of squarks or gluinos associated with much lighter ( at the same m@xmath7 , m@xmath8 ) charginos and neutralinos , or even just chargino - neutralino pair production may dominate .",

    "b ) one sees the dramatic increase of the branching ratios of lightest chargino ( @xmath29 , dashed line ) and next - to - lightest neutralino ( @xmath28 , solid line ) into final states with lightest stau with increasing tan@xmath5 , due to the increase of the tau yukawa couplings .",
    "this causes the enhancement of final states with taus at large tan@xmath5 .",
    "similar examples of masses and branching ratios dependence on tan@xmath5 for lower values of m@xmath7 and m@xmath8 ( tevatron range ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider in more detail the taus , taking now for example the decay of a heavy gluino in the appropriate domain of parameter space , and compare the abundance of taus in the final states to see the difference between large and small tan@xmath5 .",
    "figs.4 and 5 show the decay schemes of heavy gluinos and squarks at high tan@xmath5 , whilst figs.6 and 7 are for low tan@xmath5 . in fig.4 , for tan@xmath5=35 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 branching ratios for decays into @xmath42 @xmath43 exceed 60 @xmath44 . to simplify the figure ,",
    "similar intermediate states were grouped .",
    "for instance , states @xmath45wbb and @xmath45 tb were treated ( summed up ) as the same , though they have different kinematics in principle ( see the rightmost circular mark at @xmath45 horizontal line ( 1067 gev ) .",
    "it is almost impossible to follow and calculate all the branchings in gluino decays ; some small ones are not shown , thus resulting in a small underestimate of the `` final '' states ( at the level of @xmath27 ) branching ratios .",
    "the ten final states having the highest branching ratios are listed in the lower part of figs.4  7 .",
    "the right squarks ( @xmath46 ) decay entirely into @xmath27 q final state in the domain of msugra parameter space where m@xmath47 m@xmath48 as it is in the point presented in figs.4  7 .    in case of low tan@xmath5=2 , fig.6 ,",
    "the decay chains of gluinos are not so complicated as in case of high tan@xmath5 , fig.4 , mainly due to the fact that m@xmath49 m@xmath50 .",
    "right squarks again , as for high tan@xmath5 , decay entirely into lsp + quarks .",
    "in addition , at low tan@xmath5 the @xmath42 do not dominate in the decays of @xmath29 and @xmath28 , instead , branchings of @xmath29 and @xmath28 decays into selectrons and smuons are enhanced .",
    "thus final states of gluinos and squarks contain more leptons",
    "( e , @xmath25 ) in case of low tan@xmath5 than in case of high tan@xmath5 in the chosen point of msugra parameter space , as also discussed in @xcite .",
    "what is evident from the list of dominant decay modes at the bottom of figs.4  7 is that b s are abundantly produced and more so at large tan@xmath5 , but what is striking is the large number of final states containing @xmath0 s and multiple @xmath0 s at large tan@xmath5 , providing in fact a method to constrain tan@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to emphasize the instrumental implications of these observations .",
    "let us now consider 5 very different points in the ( m@xmath31,m@xmath8 ) plane for fixed values of tan@xmath5 = 35 , @xmath25 @xmath2 0 and a@xmath7=0 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "one can see that at the first point ( 130,240 ) moderately above the tevatron ii reach , and at the second point ( 400,900 ) , this latter one already shown in figs.3  5 , there is an abundant production of taus , whilst multiple b - jets originate mainly from stop / sbottom production and partly from gluino ( it is relatively heavy to contribute significantly to the total cross - section ) .",
    "some difference in the mass values between table 1 and figs.3  5 is due to the fact that values in table 1 are obtained with isajet 7.44 , whilst those in figs.3  5 are calculated with isajet 7.32 .",

    "our findings are summarized in figs.8  10 where we plot the probabilities to find at least 1 , 3 or 5 b - jets _ per event _ respectively ( with e@xmath1 @xmath2 50 gev in @xmath60 @xmath4 2.4 ) over msugra parameter space for various sets of tan@xmath5 , sign(@xmath25 ) .",
    "even the probabilities for _ 3 b - jets per event _ within cms acceptance ( and with e@xmath1 @xmath2 50 gev ! ) are significant for all tan@xmath5 over most of parameter space , from a few % to @xmath6 40 % , the region m@xmath7",
    "@xmath2 m@xmath8 being the richest one .",
    "one can see that the effect of b yukawa couplings increase with tan@xmath5 is visible only in fig.10 , i.e. asking at least 5 b - jets per event .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the exceptionally large probability per event to find a b - jet in a susy event is not limited to large m@xmath31 , m@xmath8 ( i.e. large @xmath39 , @xmath40 values ) , but _ is valid throughout the whole plane , i.e. even for @xmath39 , @xmath40 masses @xmath6 500 gev , just above the tevatron reach , _ as illustrated by columns 1 and 4 in tables 1,2 .",
    "the same probability distributions for at least 1 , 2 and 3 taus _ per event _ are shown in figs.11  13 respectively ( again for e@xmath61 @xmath2 50 gev in @xmath62 @xmath4 2.4 ) . here",
    "one can see a much more pronounced difference between various values of tan@xmath5 already with at least one tau in the final state ( fig.11 ) .",
    "the clearly visible ridge on the m@xmath31 , m@xmath8 plane corresponds to the msugra domains of parameter space where @xmath28 and @xmath29 decay into sleptons .",
    "the ridge becomes more and more pronounced as tan@xmath5 increases thanks to increasing @xmath0 yukawa couplings and decreasing @xmath0 mass relative to @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "one can also notice a significant ( 15  20 % ) level of tau production throughout the m@xmath31 , m@xmath8 plane , mainly from w and b - jets .",
    "it is also clear from the comparison of figs.8  10 with figs.11  13 that the domains of parameter space where taus and b - jets are produced abundantly are complementary , but together cover most of parameter space !",
    "it will thus be of utmost importance to have a high performance microvertex device to disentangle the complicated final states ( figs.4  7 ) through b and @xmath0 tagging , and the more so the higher is tan@xmath5 ; whether tan@xmath5 is large can be detected already in early lhc running through the modifications of the expected shape of opposite sign dilepton mass spectra discussed in ref @xcite and due precisely to the increased @xmath0 production . in general , the importance of the b - tagging capability of cms increases with the susy mass scale whatever tan@xmath5 due to complexification of the final states with increasing masses , but it is already of crucial importance in the mass range just beyond the tevatron ii reach , m@xmath48 , m@xmath48 @xmath65 400 gev , i.e , m@xmath31 @xmath65 200 gev , m@xmath8 @xmath65 400 gev in this model ( tables 1  3 and figs.8  10 ) .",
    "it has been known quantitatively for a long time that b - tagging will be important for susy studies .",
    "our investigations further strengthen this feeling . within the msugra model we find surprisingly high probabilities per event , in the few tens of % , to find hard b - jets within cms acceptance , even for multiple - b final states , the effect increasing moderately with tan@xmath5 .",
    "what is more spectacular and not so well known and appreciated , is the rapid increase of @xmath0-probability and multi-@xmath0 probability per event with increasing tan@xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , there is an almost complete complementarity in parameter space coverage by those two experimental signatures .",
    "this implies that a high performance microvertex detector will be essential for susy event analysis , especially if tan@xmath5 @xmath66 10 , and the more so more massive are the squarks and gluinos .",
    "every effort should thus be made to have a third pixel layer in the cms tracker to have redundancy and a safety margin to ensure in the impact parameter measurements .",
    "at least provisions must be made in the inner tracker mechanical design and beam pipe design that this third layer can be inserted if susy shows up at the lhc rendes - vous . also every effort should be made to keep the innermost pixel layer at 4 cm radius even in high luminosity conditions , where probably frequent replacements will be needed , as it improves significantly the b - tagging performance of cms as investigations in ref .",
    "@xcite have shown .",
    "it is also only with high luminosity that the highest masses are attainable , and it is for these masses that the decays are most complicated and b - tagging most useful .    an objection can be raised to these conclusions , namely that they are based on a very specific susy scenario - msugra .",
    "however , these conclusions will be generally true in whatever susy model as long as @xmath14 or @xmath15 are substantially lighter than the remaining squarks , and the @xmath67 is lighter than @xmath28 and/or @xmath29 and @xmath32 is not significantly heavier than other sleptons , as was discussed in section 5 .",
    "some preliminary results in the more general mssm context have already been shown , and those investigations are being actively pursued at present .",
