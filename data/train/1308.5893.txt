    "one - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems are systems of classical particles with stochastic dynamics and hard - core exclusion  @xcite . the particle disorder version of a reaction - diffusion system is a multi - species system of particles where the particle hopping rate of each species can be a quenched random variable .",
    "this means that the particles of different species have their own intrinsic rates for hopping forward and backward .",
    "on the other hand , in a site disorder version of a reaction - diffusion system the hopping rate of a given particle depends on the site in which the particle resides . in this paper",
    "we are dealing with particle disorder examples",
    ".    different types of exactly solvable multi - species reaction - diffusion systems have been introduced and studied in related literature  @xcite .",
    "the particle disorder reaction - diffusion systems usually settle into a non - equilibrium steady - state in long - time limit .",
    "there are different approaches to study these non - equilibrium steady - states .",
    "the matrix product formalism ( mpf ) is one of these techniques . according to this formalism one associates an operator to every state of a lattice - site of the system .",
    "it is assumed that the steady - state weight of each configuration of the system defined on a ring geometry is given by a trace of product of these non - commuting operators .",
    "the basics of this technique can be summarized as follows : let us consider a one - dimensional system , defined on a lattice with a ring geometry , in which each lattice - site can be in one of its @xmath0 accessible states .",
    "we define @xmath0 operators associated with different states of each lattice - site .",
    "we associate the operator @xmath1 to the @xmath2th lattice - site provided that it is occupied by a particle of type @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "if this lattice - site is empty @xmath5 then the operator @xmath6 will be associated with it .",
    "according to the mpf the steady - state weight of a given configuration similar to @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "requiring that these are the stationary weights provides us with an algebra for the operators @xmath9 s and @xmath10 . for the systems with nearest - neighbors interactions this algebra is quadratic .",
    "the mpf was first introduced in  @xcite to find the steady - state of a single - species partially asymmetric exclusion process with nearest - neighbors interactions .",
    "it was then extended and generalized to find the steady - states of multi - species reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite even with long - rage interactions  @xcite .",
    "finding the exact expressions for the steady - state weights using the mpf requires one to either work with the commutation relations of the operators or find a matrix representation for the associated algebra of the system . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is no straightforward approach to predict whether a one - dimensional reaction - diffusion system has a matrix product steady - state .",
    "this makes finding exactly solvable models with matrix product steady - states a formidable task .",
    "the number of particles in each species of a one - dimensional multi - species reaction - diffusion system can be a conserved or a non - conserved quantity . as an example for a system with conserved number of particles",
    "the authors of  @xcite have studied a particle disorder driven - diffusive system consisting of @xmath11 different species of particles which hop in a preferred direction on a discrete ring with @xmath12 lattice - sites .",
    "it has been shown that the steady - state of this system can be obtained exactly using the mpf .",
    "it also turns out that this steady - state is a product measure .",
    "exact matrix product solution for the stationary state measure of the partially asymmetric exclusion process on a ring with multiple species of particles has also been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "this is also an example for a system with conserved number of particles in each species .    in another work  @xcite",
    "the authors have introduced a totally asymmetric exclusion process on a discrete ring with @xmath11 non - conserved internal degrees of freedom . in this process , apart from the usual forward hopping of particles , the particle type can be changed i.e. a particle in one of @xmath11 possible internal states can be converted to any other @xmath13 states with different rates .",
    "it has been shown that the steady - state of this system can be obtained using a matrix product approach .",
    "the matrices associated with different states of a lattice - site satisfy an algebra which has a @xmath11-dimensional matrix representation .",
    "so far most of the reaction - diffusion systems which have been studied using the mpf belong to the group of processes in which the number of particles in each species does not change with time  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we introduce a new family of one - dimensional disordered reaction - diffusion systems whose steady - state can be obtained using the mpf ; however , the number of particles in each species changes with time .",
    "as we will see the system already studied in  @xcite is only a member of this family of exactly solvable systems .",
    "we will show that the steady - state probability distribution of this family of exactly solvable systems is factorized , similar to that of a zero - range process ( zrp ) .",
    "a zrp is a model of interacting particles which hop between the sites of a lattice with rates that depend on the occupancy of the departure sites .",
    "the interaction between the particles does not obey the exclusion principle in the sense that many indistinguishable particles might occupy a single lattice - site .",
    "the zrp has unique physical and mathematical properties  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that some of these exclusion processes can be mapped onto the zrp  @xcite .",
    "we will show that our new family of exactly solvable systems can be mapped onto a zrp .",
    "similar systems have already been studied in related literature  @xcite .",
    "we start with a disordered exclusion process defined on a one - dimensional lattice of finite size with periodic boundary conditions . under some constraints on the microscopic reaction rates",
    "the steady - state weights can be calculated exactly using the mpf .",
    "special cases are studied in more detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath14 we introduce a generalized quadratic algebra and its matrix representations . the most general dynamical rules for the processes whose steady - states can be described by this quadratic algebra are presented . we have shown that under some specific constraints on the transition rates these steady - states are matrix product states . in section @xmath15 two special examples are studied in detail .",
    "let us consider a system consisting of @xmath11 different types of classical particles which hop on a discrete ring of @xmath12 lattice - sites .",
    "each lattice - site is either occupied by one type of particle or empty . on each lattice - site @xmath2 ( @xmath16 )",
    "we allow for @xmath0 configurations described by means of the variable @xmath3 , which takes @xmath17 values @xmath18 . for @xmath5",
    "the lattice - site @xmath2 is empty and for @xmath19 the lattice - site @xmath2 is occupied by a particle of type @xmath20 where @xmath21 . for two adjacent lattice - sites",
    "@xmath22 the rate of exchange between the configuration ( @xmath23 ) into the configuration ( @xmath24 ) is represented by @xmath25 .",
    "the time evolution of the probability distribution of a markovian interacting particle system @xmath26 is given by a schrdinger like equation in imaginary time @xmath27 in which @xmath28 is a stochastic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are the transition rates between different configurations . for a one - dimensional system with nearest - neighbors interactions",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath28 has the following general form @xmath29 in which @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a @xmath32 identity matrix and @xmath33 is a @xmath34 matrix for the bulk interactions and its matrix elements are defied as @xmath35_{\\gamma_i,\\gamma_{i+1}}^{\\tau_i,\\tau_{i+1 } } \\;\\ ; \\mbox{for\\;\\;$\\gamma_j\\neq\\tau_j$ and $ j = i , i+1 $ } \\cr \\cr -{\\sum'}_{\\beta_i,\\beta_{i+1}}\\left[\\gamma_{i , i+1}\\right]^{\\tau_i,\\tau_{i+1}}_{\\beta_i,\\beta_{i+1 } } \\;\\ ; \\mbox{else } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] in which @xmath36 denotes the sum where the term @xmath37 is excluded .",
    "the number of the particles of type @xmath20 is denoted by @xmath38 then the number of empty lattice - site is given by @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state of the system i.e the right eigenvector of the hamiltonian @xmath28 with eigenvalue zero .",
    "in what follows we will apply the mpf in order to find this eigenvector of @xmath28 . as me mentioned above",
    "we associate the operator @xmath40 @xmath41 to the presence of a particle of type @xmath20 at a given lattice - site .",
    "we also associate the operator @xmath10 to an empty lattice - site .",
    "let us assume that the operators @xmath42 s and @xmath10 satisfy the following generalized quadratic algebra @xmath43 in which the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be any non - zero positive or negative numbers .",
    "as we will see for any disordered reaction - diffusion system , these parameters should be calculated separately .",
    "we are looking for those disordered reaction - diffusion systems with the hamiltonian of the form  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) whose steady - states can be described by the quadratic algebra  ( [ algebra2 ] ) .",

    "these constraints can be obtained as follows : according to the mpf the steady - state probability distribution of the system which satisfies @xmath52 is written as @xmath53 which is defined as @xmath54 should satisfy  @xcite @xmath55=x\\otimes \\mathcal{d}-\\mathcal{d}\\otimes x\\;.\\ ] ] this defines the quadratic algebra of the system .",

    "here we should solve a set of @xmath64 equations with @xmath65 unknowns i.e. @xmath60 s and @xmath61 s .",
    "the number of equations are greater than or equal to the number of the unknowns , hence these set of equations can only be solved under some constraints on the transitions rates in ( [ dynamic koli ] ) .    in section @xmath15",
    "these constraints are calculated for @xmath66 .",
    "the transition rates in ( [ dynamic koli ] ) should be chosen on the conditions that the constraints  ( [ constraint ] ) are satisfied thus we can introduce a family of systems which can be described by the generalized quadratic algebra ( [ algebra2 ] ) .    in the next section",

    "it is easy to see that the steady - state probability distribution function of the systems that can be described by ( [ algebra2 ] ) are product measures .",

    "if the number of empty lattice - sites in front of the @xmath20th particle ( @xmath72 ) is denoted by @xmath73 , the steady - state probability of finding the system in a generic configuration @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 in which @xmath76 is a normalization factor and @xmath77 is the total number of empty lattice - sites . using the matrix representation",
