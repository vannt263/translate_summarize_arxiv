    "we deviate from the main body of the paper and give a summary of the construction of the @xmath6-deformed algebra @xmath16 , where the algebraic structure may also be mapped @xcite on the undeformed @xmath3 algebra . unlike the @xmath7-deformed case discussed in @xmath181 and @xmath173 , the map obtained in @xcite is invertible and non - singular .    starting with a contraction @xmath182 where @xmath183 are the generators of the two deformed @xmath13 algebras , we define @xmath184 the modifications with respect to @xcite , in the definitions of @xmath185 , @xmath186 are suitable for our purpose .",
