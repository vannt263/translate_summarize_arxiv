    "it has long been known that t tauri stars ( ttss ) emit infrared ( ir ) radiation in excess of their stellar photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite speculated that silicate dust in orbit around these stars was responsible for this excess emission . with observations from the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras )",
    ", it was shown that the 12100@xmath0 ir excess emission from these young stars could arise from dusty accretion disks @xcite .",
    "many different models for this disk emission have been proposed .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite construct disk models including both accretion and reprocessing of stellar radiation . in order to explain how disk reprocessing can be responsible for the ir excesses of most ttss , (",
    "* henceforth kh87 ) proposed that disks around ttss are flared , in that the scale height of the disk increases more than linearly with the distance from the central star . a flared disk intercepts a larger solid angle of radiation emitted from the star than a flat or nonflared disk , leading to more reprocessing of starlight .",
    "kh87 suggest that the surface of such a flared disk would become hotter than the midplane due to radiative transfer effects .",
    "the disk material is optically thick to @xmath3@xmath41@xmath0 stellar radiation , so the starlight is absorbed in the highest layers of the disk . at @xmath3@xmath410@xmath0 , characteristic of the reprocessed radiation from the top disk layers at r@xmath41au in the disk ,",
    "the disk has less optical depth , and the reprocessed radiation diffuses into the interior parts of the disk and heats those regions .",
    "for the small accretion rates typical of tts , the disk atmosphere heats to a higher temperature than the layers in the disk underneath , and the vertical temperature inversion produces silicate features in emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarizes how , based on the ir spectroscopic observations of @xcite , it came to be established that the 10@xmath0 emission ( or absorption ) feature , the broad emission ( or absorption ) feature from 8 to 13@xmath0 seen in a number of astronomical objects , is due to the si  o stretching modes in silicate grains .",
    "spectrophotometric observations by @xcite and @xcite at wavelengths longer than 16@xmath0 provided further support for the silicate hypothesis .",
    "they found an 18.5@xmath0 peak in the trapezium emission and an 18.5@xmath0 maximum in the absorption from the bn - kl source ; the pairing of the 18.5@xmath0 feature ( the broad emission or absorption feature from 16 to 23@xmath0 ) with the 10@xmath0 features in the trapezium and the bn - kl source confirmed the silicate hypothesis .",
    "there have been many studies of the silicate features of ttss , both ground - based @xcite and space - based @xcite . however , ground - based spectroscopic observations are limited by the earth s atmosphere at mid - ir wavelengths in both wavelength coverage and sensitivity . space - based missions , such as the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do not suffer these limitations .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite offers greater sensitivity than previous space - based missions .",
    "here we focus on studying the 10@xmath0 silicate features of ttss with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board spitzer .",

    "spitzer _ irs spectra of objects with class i spectral energy distributions ( seds ) @xcite , objects believed to be young protostars still surrounded by collapsing envelope material from their parent cloud of gas and dust , show smooth , featureless 10@xmath0 absorption profiles , indicating amorphous silicates .",
    "@xcite presented the spectrum of coku tau/4 , a t tauri star with a 530@xmath5 m spectrum well modeled by @xcite by an accretion disk nearly devoid of small dust grains within @xmath610au . unlike the complex 10@xmath0 emission features of many",
    "herbig ae / be stars indicative of thermally processed silicates @xcite , the 10@xmath0 emission feature of coku tau/4 is smooth , relatively narrow , and featureless , as are the silicate absorption profiles of the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and class i ysos @xcite .",
    "smooth , narrow , and featureless profiles indicate amorphous silicates .",
    "other objects , such as fn tau @xcite , have significant crystallinity of silicate dust in their disks , evident in the structure in their 10@xmath0 emission features , and others still , such as gg tau a , have larger grains as shown by the greater width of the 10@xmath0 emission feature .    in the following , we use optical constants and opacities of various materials to model the 10@xmath0 features of our objects .",
    "we model the dust emission of the six objects whose spectra are presented by @xcite , tw hya and hen 3 - 600 a by @xcite , v410 anon 13 by @xcite , and gm aur and dm tau by @xcite ; we also present and model the 514@xmath0 spectrum of gg tau b. stellar properties for our tts sample are given in table 1 . in  2 , we describe our data reduction techniques . in  3 ,",

    "the present 12 tts were observed with the irs on board _",
    "spitzer _ over three observing campaigns from 2004 january 4 to 2004 march 5 .",
    "all objects were observed with both orders of the short - low ( sl ) module ( r @xmath660120 ; second order [ sl2 ] , @xmath7@xmath3=0.06@xmath0 [ 5.27.5@xmath0 ] ; first order [ sl1 ] , @xmath7@xmath3=0.12@xmath0 [ 7.514@xmath0 ] ) .",
    "fainter objects were observed with the long - low ( ll ) module ( r@xmath660120 ; second order [ ll2 ] , @xmath7@xmath3=0.17@xmath0 [ 1421.3@xmath0 ] ; first order [ ll1 ] , @xmath7@xmath3=0.34@xmath0 [ 19.538@xmath0 ] ) , while brighter objects were observed with the short - high ( sh ; r@xmath6600 , 9.919.6@xmath0 ) and long - high ( lh ; r@xmath6600 , 18.737.2@xmath0 ) modules ( the lh spectra are not used here ) .",
    "the brightest objects were observed in mapping mode , in which for one module one data collection event ( dce ; sampling of spectral signal from target ) was executed for each position of a 2@xmath93 ( spatial direction @xmath9 spectral direction ) raster centered on the coordinates of the target . for details on how the 2@xmath93 maps were obtained ,",
    "see the description of spectral mapping mode by @xcite . from mapping - mode observations ,",
    "we derive our spectra from the two positions in the 2@xmath93 map for which the flux levels in the raw extracted spectra are highest .",
    "all other objects were observed in staring mode , which always immediately followed single high - precision pointing calibration and reference sensor ( pcrs ) peak - up observations . for details on irs",

    "we conclude that mispointing in the cross - dispersion direction in sl in mapping mode and in staring mode is usually less than 0@xmath109 ( half a pixel ) . by comparing the absolute flux levels of the spectra obtained from each of the three positions in a 1@xmath93 subsection ( the three positions are colinear and offset from each other in the dispersion direction of the slit ) of the 2@xmath93 raster",
    ", the pointing of the telescope in the dispersion direction in mapping mode could be determined .",
    "the mapping mode dispersion direction mispointing is usually less than half a pixel in sl ( 0@xmath109 ) . pointing in the dispersion direction",
    "can not be quantified very easily for staring mode observations because the telescope is not moved in the dispersion direction in this mode . to account for mispointing in the cross - dispersion direction ,",
    "we use data that has been divided by the flatfield from the s11 pipeline . mispointing in the dispersion direction primarily causes small photometric error ; this will not affect the emissivities derived here .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the spectral modeling , analysis , and reduction tool ( smart ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from basic calibrated data ( bcd ;",
    "flat - fielded , stray - light - corrected , dark - current - subtracted ) s11.0.2 products from the _ spitzer _ science center irs data calibration pipeline , permanently bad ( nan ) pixels were fixed in our two - dimensional spectral data .",
    "the corrected pixel value was a linear interpolation of the nonbad pixels of the set of four nearest neighboring pixels ( up , down , left , and right of the pixel in question ) .",
    "unresolved lines of [ ne ii ] and molecular hydrogen , seen in the spectra of other objects , provided the wavelength calibration ; all spectra presented in this paper are wavelength - corrected , and these wavelengths are estimated to be accurate to @xmath110.02@xmath0 .",
    "all dces taken at the same pointing of the telescope ( same module / order / nod position ) were averaged together . because one order records the spectrum of sky @xmath613away from the target",
    "whose spectrum is being recorded in the module s other order , sky subtraction in low resolution spectra obtained in staring mode is accomplished by subtracting the average spectrum from one spectral order of a given module from that in which the spectrum is located in the same nod position of the other order of the same module . for fm tau ,",
    "the ssc pipeline introduced artifacts in the off - order images in sl2 . in this case",
    ", we used the same - order , different - nod dce to subtract the sky .",
    "the low - resolution sky - subtracted spectra were then extracted using variable - width column extraction in order to account for the linear increase of size of the object s psf with wavelength . from shortest to longest wavelengths of each module , respectively , extraction region width varied from 3.2 to 4.9 pixels in sl2 , 3.6 to 4.4 pixels in sl bonus order ( a short fragment of first - order light from 7.58.4@xmath0 recorded simultaneously with sl2 ) , 2.7 - 5.4 pixels in sl1 , 3.2 - 4.9 pixels in ll2 , 3.8 - 4.3 pixels in ll bonus order ( a short fragment of first - order light from 19.4 to 20.9@xmath0 recorded simultaneously with ll2 ) , and 2.5 to 5.5 pixels in ll1 . for sh the sky is not subtracted , as the sh slit is only 5 pixels long , and no separate sky observations were acquired .",
    "the extraction region at each wavelength for sh was the entire 5 pixel long slit .",
    "since the roughly square sh pixels are @xmath62@xmath102 wide and sl pixels are @xmath61@xmath108 wide , the sh extraction region covered more solid angle at every wavelength than sl , and as spectra from sh typically gave lower flux than sl over the wavelength range of overlap of sh with sl ( @xmath61014@xmath0 ) , the sky levels for the sh observations are estimated to be much lower than the flux density of the point sources .",
    "the spectra are calibrated using a relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) , which gives flux density , f@xmath12 , at each wavelength based on the signal detected at that wavelength .",
    "the rsrfs were derived by dividing the template spectrum of a calibrator star by the result of extraction of the calibrator s spectrum in smart for each nod of each order of each module . for both orders of sl and for both orders of ll , a spectral template of @xmath13 lacertae ( a1v ; m. cohen 2004 , private communication ) of higher spectral resolution than the templates described by @xcite",
    "was used , and a spectral template for @xmath14 dra ( k2iii ) was used for sh @xcite . as with the science targets , sh observations of the calibrator source @xmath14 dra",
    "were not sky - subtracted .",
    "the science target raw extractions were then multiplied by the rsrfs corresponding to the same nod , order , and module . typically , good flux agreement at wavelength regions of order overlap within the same module was found . as the spectra obtained for a given source at the telescope s two nod positions are independent measurements of the object s spectrum",
    ", close agreement between the two nod positions was expected ; this was the case for all sources except for fn tau .",
    "fn tau was observed in mapping mode , and from the extracted flux levels of all observations in the 2@xmath93 mapping raster , we determined that the central 1@xmath92 pair both suffer mispointing of differing amounts .",
    "the more mispointed dce was mispointed in the dispersion direction by 0@xmath107 , while the less mispointed dce was mispointed in this direction by 0@xmath103 ; both dces were mispointed in the cross - dispersion direction by between 0@xmath105 and 0@xmath107 .",
    "the effect of this differential mispointing shows up most prominently in the derived spectrum of the more mispointed observation of first order of sl ; there is a mismatch of flux level of about 10@xmath15 over the entire order compared to the flux level of the spectrum obtained from the less mispointed dce . to correct for this ,",
    "the first order of the spectrum from the more mispointed mapping position was multiplied by 1.1 to match the less mispointed position . except for the first order of sl for fn tau , the derived spectra are the mean at each order of each module of the spectra from the two independent nod or map positions .",
    "for the first order of sl for fn tau , the reported spectrum is that from only the less mispointed map position .",
    "error bars are derived for each of the spectra , and the error bar at a given wavelength is equal to half the difference between the flux ( at that wavelength ) from the two nod ( or map ) positions used to derive the mean spectrum . for sl first order of fn tau",
    ", the spectrum from the less mispointed map position and the corrected spectrum ( previously described ) from the more mispointed map position were used to derive its error bars . any error bar with relative uncertainty",
    "@xmath11% is attributed to the low number ( 2 ) of measurements at that wavelength , and that errorbar is set to 1% of the flux .",
    "there are some mismatches in flux between sl and sh , and between sl and ll in the spectra . comparing the sl spectra of nonvariable sources to available photometry",
    ", absolute spectrophotometric accuracy is estimated to be better than 10% in sl .",
    "therefore , small mismatches in flux levels between sl , sh , and ll are corrected by scaling the entire longer wavelength module to match the flux in sl , as we trust the photometric levels of sl .",
    "sh was multiplied by factors between 1.04 and 1.11 to match sl ; ll for cy tau was multiplied by 0.95 to match its sl spectrum . in order to account for off - order leaks in the filters which define the orders of each of the modules ,",
    "the ends of each order of every module are truncated to guarantee the spectral purity of our spectra .",
    "the spectra of all objects in the sample excluding gg tau b have been previously published : coku tau/4 , fm tau , ip tau , gg tau a , fn tau , and cy tau in @xcite ; tw hya and hen 3 - 600 a in @xcite ; v410 anon 13 in @xcite ; and gm aur and dm tau in @xcite .",
    "for all previously published spectra except the two by @xcite , wavelengths from 8 to 14@xmath0 were too long by 0.05@xmath0 ; as described previously , this wavelength problem was corrected before further analysis .",
    "the correction has moved the 9.4@xmath0 feature in fn tau noted by @xcite closer to 9.3@xmath0 . in figure 1 ,",
    "the spectrum obtained of the gg tau b binary system is shown ; in  4 we discuss the origin of the ir excess for this pair .",
    "for all of the objects in the sample except v410 anon 13 , no correction for extinction is applied , in order not to introduce artifacts of overcorrection for extinction .",
    "see table 1 for the assumed visual extinction @xmath16 for each of the objects in our sample .",
    "no extinction correction is applied for any object having @xmath16 less than 1.4 ; this includes all objects in the sample except coku tau/4 , gg tau a , and v410 anon 13 . as described by @xcite , optical spectra of coku tau/4",
    "indicate time - dependent reddening to the star .",
    "this suggests that the source of the extinction to coku tau/4 may be local to the object .",
    "however , the precise time and space dependence of extinction to coku tau/4 is unknown .",
    "for this reason , no extinction correction is applied for coku tau/4 .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath16 of @xmath4 3.2 toward gg tau ab ( the gg tau system is a hierarchical quadruple with the northern pair , gg tau a , being binary and separated by 0@xmath1025  this is described in greater detail in  4 ) , while @xmath16@xmath170.72 toward gg tau aa .",
    "consequently , no extinction correction is applied for gg tau a , as it is believed the less extinguished gg tau aa component dominates the irs spectrum .    for v410 anon 13 ,",
    "an extinction correction is applied , assuming @xmath16@xmath175.8 along with @xcite .",
    "furlan present a disk model for this object to fit its irs spectrum assuming an inclination @xmath18 = 70 . because of the large implied disk inclination , at least part of the extinction to v410 anon 13 could be due to dust in the flared disk atmosphere at large disk radii lying in the sightline from the star and inner disk regions to observer .",
    "@xcite also found that when @xmath18 in the model is changed from 70to 60 , the peak of the flux in the 10@xmath0 feature increases by @xmath620@xmath15 . because the emergent disk spectrum in the model greatly depends on its inclination @xmath18 , the effect of extinction correction for this object",
    "is discussed in  4.12 when describing its dust model fit . because dust in the outermost reaches of yso disks",
    "is expected to be little altered from its origin in the ism ( see the discussion in  5 below ) , the composition of any dust providing local extinction is assumed to be approximately the same as that in the ism between v410 anon 13 and earth .    in the ism ,",
    "the ratio of the visual extinction to the optical depth at the 9.7@xmath0 peak of the silicate absorption feature ( @xmath16/@xmath7@xmath19 ) varies by as much as a factor of 2 to 3 ( see draine 2003 ) . to convert from @xmath16 to the 9.7@xmath0 extinction ,",
    "we take @xmath16/@xmath7@xmath19@xmath1718 , typical for the local diffuse ism ( see draine 2003 ) . for simplicity , we assume that the composition of the material responsible for the extinction does not change over the sightline from the target to earth .      the spectral excess for each of the objects in the sample is interpreted as arising from a disk surrounding one or more central star(s ) beginning in most cases at a few stellar radii away from the central star(s ) and extending as far away as a few hundred au .",
    "we call a disk a `` transitional disk '' if it is optically thick to mid - ir wavelengths over some range of radii and optically thin elsewhere .",
    "coku tau/4 @xcite , dm tau @xcite , gm aur @xcite , tw hya @xcite , and hen 3 - 600 a @xcite have been shown to be transitional disks through spectral modeling .",
    "the spectrum of coku tau/4 is photospheric at wavelengths shortward of 8@xmath0 but has a large ir excess seen in its irs spectrum longward of that wavelength ; correspondingly , it has an optically thick disk at radii greater than 10au with less than @xmath60.0007 lunar masses of small silicate dust grains inside that radius @xcite .",
    "dm tau has an irs spectrum similar to that of coku tau/4 and is modeled similarly by @xcite , but with the radius of transition between the optically thick disk and the ( very ) optically thin inner regions at 3au .",
    "gm aur , tw hya , and hen 3 - 600 a , also with large excess above photosphere longward of 8@xmath0 , are not photospheric shortward of 8@xmath0 .",
    "this excess indicates an optically thin inner disk region .",
    "the ir disk emission for each of the transitional disks is isolated by subtracting an appropriate stellar photosphere represented by a blackbody . for coku tau/4 and dm tau ,",
    "the blackbody is fit to the 58@xmath0 irs spectral data , while for gm aur , tw hya , and hen 3 - 600 a the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody is fit to that of the stellar photosphere model by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this isolated disk emission for each object should , shortward of @xmath620@xmath0 , be due in large part to emission from the optically thin regions of the disk .",
    "for coku tau/4 and dm tau , this emission is mostly due to the optically thin regions of each object s wall . for gm aur , tw hya , and hen 3 - 600 a , this emission is mostly due to the optically thin inner disk regions @xcite .",
    "we refer to a `` full disk '' if the disk is optically thick to mid - ir wavelengths throughout and extends from the dust - sublimation radius from the central star . following the reasoning of @xcite , fm tau , ip tau , gg tau a , gg tau b , fn tau",
    ", v410 anon 13 , and cy tau are identified as having full disks based on their 58@xmath0 spectra .",
    "each has a continuum from 5 to 8@xmath0 characterized by a spectral slope shallower than the rayleigh - jeans tail from a naked stellar photosphere .",
    "in addition , the 5 to 8@xmath0 flux exceeds that from stellar photosphere alone ( modeled by fitting a stellar blackbody to the near - ir photometry ) by factors @xmath202 .",
    "following the discussion by @xcite , most of the 58@xmath0 emission from full disks originates from optically thick inner disk regions , while most of the emission in the dust features above the continuum longward of 8@xmath0 is due to emission from dust suspended in the optically thin disk atmosphere .",
    "therefore , a power law continuum is fit to the @xmath18@xmath0 region of each `` full - disk '' spectrum and subtracted from the spectrum to isolate the optically thin disk atmospheric emission .",
    "dust grains suspended in the optically thin atmosphere of a flared disk are directly exposed to stellar radiation , which heats the grains above the temperature of the disk s photosphere .",
    "the grains then reemit the absorbed energy according to their temperature ; this emission gives rise to the distinctive dust features seen in the spectra beyond 8@xmath0 .",
    "the emission features are much narrower than a planck function , which indicates structure in the dust emissivity .",
    "as explained in @xcite , a radiatively heated disk with a modest accretion rate has a thermal inversion .",
    "the upper layers of the disk , the optically thin disk atmosphere , are hotter than the lower layers , which are optically thick .",
    "this gives rise to spectral emission features characteristic of the dust in the disk atmosphere .    in modeling the seds of classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) , both @xcite and @xcite compute the temperature of the atmosphere of each annulus of disk material as a function of vertical optical depth . in such models , it is assumed that all dust grains at a given height in an annulus are at the same temperature , independent of grain composition and grain size .",
    "it is similarly assumed here that all grains in any sufficiently small volume in a disk are at the same temperature , independent of grain composition and grain size .",
    "we aim for a simple model in order to determine the composition of the part of the disk giving rise to the optically thin dust emission . @xcite and @xcite",
    "also model dust emission by assuming a single temperature for all dust components .",
    "optically thin emission from dust over the range of radii ( and therefore temperatures ) that contributes most to the 820@xmath0 range is represented by emission from optically thin dust at a single , `` average '' temperature , @xmath21 .",
    "it is assumed that the monochromatic flux of this optically thin emission over the short range from 8 to 14@xmath0 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is either the photosphere - subtracted residuals ( for transitional disks ) or power - law - continuum - subtracted residuals ( for full disks ) ; @xmath24 is referred to as the emissivity ; @xmath25 is the solid angle of the region of optically thin emission ; and @xmath26 is the frequency - dependent optical depth of dust . for all objects except gg tau b and gm aur , @xmath21",
    "is found by assuming a long- to short - wavelength emissivity ratio , @xmath27/@xmath28 , with `` @xmath29 '' meaning long wavelengths ( @xmath620@xmath0 ) and `` @xmath30 '' meaning short wavelengths ( @xmath610@xmath0 ) , for dust and solving for @xmath21 in the equation @xmath31    for gg tau b , where no long - wavelength data exist , a dust temperature of 252k is assumed , the same temperature as for gg tau a. for reasons discussed in  4.4 , the dust temperature is set to @xmath21=310k for gm aur . for all other objects observed with sl and ll excluding dm tau , we take the 20@xmath0 - 10@xmath0 flux ratios ; for the objects observed in sl , sh , and lh , we decrease the wavelengths in the ratio to 19.3 and 9.65@xmath0 , as sh does not extend to 20.0@xmath0 . in a single - temperature dust model , the same temperature will be computed regardless of the wavelengths used to determine the flux ratio due to the properties of the planck function .",
    "the wavelengths were set to 9.5 and 19.0@xmath0 for dm tau as a test to determine if the derived temperature depended much on the exact choice of wavelengths used to the determine flux ratio . when the wavelengths were changed to 10 and 20@xmath0 for dm tau , the computed temperature changed from 160 to 158k ; however , this did not require any change to the dm tau dust model .",
    "a similar test was performed on fn tau by changing the long and short wavelength fluxes used for its dust temperature determination from 10 and 20@xmath0 to 9.5 and 19@xmath0 .",
    "this increased dust temperature from 208 to 209k ; as with dm tau , no change to the fn tau dust model was required .",
    "using this temperature , @xmath21 , the photosphere- or continuum - subtracted residuals were divided by @xmath32 to give the emissivity , which is proportional to the mass - weighted sum of opacities as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass fraction of dust component @xmath35 , @xmath36(@xmath3 ) is the wavelength - dependent opacity ( @xmath37g@xmath38 ) of dust component @xmath35 , and @xmath39(@xmath3 ) is the wavelength - dependent cross - section of the dust mixture model . both @xmath40(@xmath3 ) and @xmath39(@xmath3 )",
    "are normalized to unity at their peak in the 814@xmath0 range .    to determine the uncertainties in the emissivities , the corresponding spectral error bars , obtained as described in  2.3 from spectra obtained at two nod positions , are divided by @xmath32 , the result of which",
    "is then divided by the same normalization constant used to derive the corresponding emissivity .",
    "the derived emissivities are believed to be valid immediately longward of 8@xmath0 , where the 10@xmath0 feature rises above the extrapolation of the @xmath18@xmath0 continuum , as no drastic change of the slope of the continuum from the optically thick components of the disks at wavelengths between 8 and 14@xmath0 is expected . however , assuming one dust temperature for a wide range of wavelengths in a spectrum of a circumstellar disk is unrealistic .",
    "in addition , for wavelengths longward of @xmath614@xmath0 , the slope of the continuum from optically thick emission is not well determined by extrapolation from the @xmath18@xmath0 continuum .",
    "the power - law - continuum- or photosphere - subtracted residual flux at @xmath620@xmath0 , attributed as described previously to optically thin emission , is therefore uncertain , leading to uncertainty in the derived dust temperature .",
    "for this reason , we do not attempt to fit the 18@xmath0 and longer wavelength features here .",
    "the emissivity is fit by finding the optimal set of mass fractions , @xmath34 , such that the normalized model dust cross - section fits the normalized emissivity as well as possible .",
    "the fitting method is iterated until the assumed @xmath27/@xmath28 , used to compute grain temperature and therefore derive emissivity , equals the @xmath27/@xmath28 derived from the fit emissivities ; @xmath27/@xmath28 and other details of derivation of emissivities are reported for each of the opacity models in table 2 .",
    "also listed in table 2 is @xmath41 , the ratio of the continuum - subtracted residual flux at 9.9@xmath0 to the 9.9@xmath0 continuum of the full disks , which gives the contrast of the silicate emission feature to the optically thick continuum in the original spectrum .      as a test of these simple dust models , a disk model following the methods of @xcite",
    "was computed , using stellar parameters from table 1 and the mass accretion rate from @xcite .",
    "first , opacities similar to those generated from the fit to the emissivity of ip tau ( see  4.7 ) were used to determine the temperature structure of the disk , but it was found that the disk would not heat up sufficiently  the spectrum generated from this model had lower flux than the ip tau spectrum at all wavelengths . a source of dust opacity with high absorption at visible and near - ir wavelengths was needed to absorb the stellar radiation and heat up the disk to give more flux at all irs wavelengths ( 536@xmath0 ) .",

    "we note in the appendix that 0.1@xmath0 sized porous grains of @xmath13 quartz and forsterite give rise to opacity profiles nearly identical to those of solid grains of @xmath13 quartz and forsterite with the cde distribution , respectively .",

    "as with cde2 , cde also assumes particles much smaller than the wavelengths of interest .",
    "because opacities for crystalline pyroxene grains ground in an agate mortar @xcite are used , no definitive statements about the grain shape distribution for this species of dust can be made .",
    "as described by @xcite , forsterite was ground into powder ; when observed with a scanning electron microscope , the forsterite particles constituting the powder are observed to be nonspherical .",

    "this could indicate a slight compositional difference , although note the large error bars for @xmath3@xmath19.55@xmath0 in coku tau/4 .",

    "although small nonspherical grains of amorphous olivine and pyroxene account successfully for the peaks of the 10 and 18@xmath0 features , the model with small silicate grains does not account for a very small excess of emissivity on the long - wavelength side of the coku tau/4 10@xmath0 feature .",
    "optically thick emission from the dust would widen the 10@xmath0 feature , but it would do so to both the long- and short - wavelength sides of the feature .",

    "while models consisting of only silicates can account for the positions and shapes of the 10 and 18@xmath0 features , the 1215@xmath0 opacity continuum from laboratory silicates is lower than that in the derived coku tau/4 emissivity .",

    "the derived dust temperature for dm tau , 160k , is only slightly higher than that for coku tau/4 ( 121k ) , which reinforces the conclusion that dm tau has no inner dust disk ( see  4.2 ) . as with coku tau/4 , the disk at radii larger than 3au",
    "is optically thick , and the spectrum from 5 to 8@xmath0 is photospheric .",

    "their model includes an optically thin inner disk from the dust sublimation radius out to 5au containing @xmath60.02 lunar masses of small dust grains , negligible small dust grains between 5 and 24au , and a full outer disk beyond 24au .",
    "the usual method of computing dust temperature self - consistently based on the short- to long - wavelength flux ratio derived from the photosphere - subtracted residuals results in a very poor fit to the derived gm aur emissivity .",

    "therefore , a self - consistent dust temperature of @xmath21=386k was determined for gm aur using the fluxes at 9.4 and 18.8@xmath0 of the optically thin inner disk component from the gm aur model of @xcite .",
    "this gave a somewhat better fit to the computed emissivity .",
    "the model required @xmath653% by mass small amorphous olivine and @xmath447 @xmath15 amorphous carbon and gave a @xmath64/dof of 44.4 , with the dust model overestimating the emissivity shortward of the 10@xmath0 feature peak and underestimating the emissivity longward of 12.5@xmath0 .",
    "the low dust temperature of 210k resulted from including emission from the very cold wall at 24au in the model of @xcite .",
    "the second method excludes the wall emission and gave a dust temperature of 386k .",
    "the dust model assuming dust at 210k underestimates the 8@xmath0 emissivity while the model assuming 386k dust overestimates the 8@xmath0 emissivity ( and the opposite effects happen at @xmath614@xmath0 ) .",

    "this seems to indicate that little processing occurs in the outer disks , or , if processing does occur in the inner disk , the dust in the inner disk is not transported efficiently to the outer disk .",
    "perhaps the material in the inner optically thin disk of gm aur was located between 10 and 24au immediately before the planet formed near 24au .",

    "all spectra except v410 anon 13 indicate some large grains , but a greater crystalline mass fraction does not appear to correlate with a greater large - grain mass fraction ( see figure 8) for the t tauri objects in our sample .",
    "see the discussion in  3.5 on how grain sizes and shapes assumed in this study compare to those in other studies @xcite . because quartz accounts for less than @xmath63% of the total dust mass in the models , this implies that the mass fraction of forsterite and crystalline pyroxene does not correlate with that of the 5@xmath0 sized porous amorphous silicate grains .",
    "it seems reasonable that , over time , the mass fraction of crystalline grains would increase , as should the mass fraction of large grains in disks around stars .",

    "the rates of increase of the crystalline grain mass fraction and of the large grain mass fraction should not necessarily be the same for even one single yso disk .",

    "if , as proposed by @xcite , large grains in disks settle more quickly than smaller grains toward the optically thick midplane , and vertical convection is negligible ( as is expected due to the vertical temperature inversion in disk atmospheres ) , then the lack of larger grains in a disk may simply be due to the fact that large grains have settled from the optically thin atmosphere of the disk , where they can be seen , down to the optically thick midplane",

    "the 10@xmath0 features in 10 tts spectra from the taurus - auriga star - forming region and 2 spectra from the tw hydrae association are modeled by deriving the emissivities from irs spectra of the optically thin dust emission . through an iterative process of varying dust grain mass fractions of various dust species to match the dust cross - sections to the derived emissivities and using the derived @xmath39(@xmath420 @xmath5m)/@xmath39(@xmath410 @xmath5 m ) ratios to recompute the dust temperature ( and therefore self - consistently define the emissivity ) , the modeled emissivities are fit with a multi - component dust model .    to test the simple single - temperature approach of deriving and fitting the 10@xmath0 feature emissivities , a wavelength - dependent dust cross - section similar to the one generated from the fit to ip tau was used to determine the emergent spectrum in a model of its emission , and it was found that the fit to the spectrum of ip tau requires a significant source of absorption at visible / near - ir wavelengths . to fit the interstellar extinction",
    ", @xcite also required a source of absorption at these wavelengths in addition to that from known silicates .",
    "consequently , graphite and `` astronomical silicates '' were used to determine the radial and vertical temperature structure of the model disk for ip tau , and a dust mixture similar to the best - fit dust mixture for this object was used to compute the emergent spectrum from the model disk .",
    "this full radiative transfer model gave an excellent fit to the 512@xmath0 spectrum of ip tau , supporting the simplified emissivity modeling technique used here .",
    "the model predicts too much emission at wavelengths longer than 12@xmath0 , indicating too much emission in the model from cooler dust grains , suggesting there is settling of dust from the disk atmosphere to the midplane .",
    "our 12 object sample indicates the following :    * almost all the t tauri disks show some degree of silicate crystallinity , irrespective of star mass or age .",
    "* transitional disks , disks whose inner portions are either partially or nearly totally cleared of small dust grains , usually indicate very few crystalline silicate grains .",
    "* theories of radial transport of crystalline silicates in t tauri disks are constrained to explain the ism - like lack of crystalline silicates outward of 3au in dm tau and outward of 10au in coku tau/4 , both of which are 13 myr old systems . *",
    "no obvious correlation of the mass fraction of crystalline silicate grains with that of large silicate grains exists for the t tauri sample .",
    "this contrasts with the results of @xcite for herbig ae / be systems ( see discussion in  3.5 regarding differences in grain shape and size between this study and bouwman et al . [",
    "2001 ] and van boekel et al .",
    "[ 2005 ] ) . *",
    "the 10@xmath0 features always indicate a majority of mass in amorphous silicate grains . *",
    "crystalline pyroxene is usually accompanied by forsterite , but the reverse is not necessarily true .",
    "* very low mass stars can have relatively large amounts of crystalline silicates in their surrounding disks . *",
    "no clear trend exists between the mass fraction of crystalline silicates and the disk - to - star mass ratio . * for full disks , high contrast of the 10@xmath0 feature , as measured by @xmath41 , indicates both low crystallinity and small mass fraction of large grains ; decreasing contrast of the 10@xmath0 feature for these disks indicates increasing crystallinity and a range of mass fractions of large grains .",
    "this is consistent with studies of herbig ae / be stars @xcite and previous studies of t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "* there is an indication that higher quartz mass fraction accompanies lower amorphous olivine to amorphous pyroxene ratio .",
    "one of the surprising results of this study is the lack of correlation of the silicate crystallinity with anything else .",
    "this may reflect the diversity in the evolutionary histories of disks ( e.g. , some make more crystalline silicates than others ) , which may be a consequence of initial conditions ( e.g. , initial disk mass and angular momentum ) and/or environment ( e.g. , binarity ) .",
    "considerable diversity may result from the process of giant planet formation .",
    "for example , suppose that within the first 13myr of existence , all disks accumulate crystalline silicate grains in their inner disks either by inner disk heating and outward radial transport or by local annealing of silicate grains .",
    "suppose further that a giant planet forms in the inner disk . according to @xcite , the planet clears a gap in the disk and absorbs the accretion from the outer disk .",
    "the inner disk is cleared by accretion onto the star in @xmath610@xmath72 yr , leaving a transitional disk with the characteristics of the disk around either coku tau/4 or dm tau .",
    "the remnant outer disk has very few crystalline silicate dust grains remaining , also like coku tau/4 .",
    "if the disk is sufficiently massive , as is the case with dm tau , the planet can migrate radially inward . if this planet formation and migration scenario happens with sufficient frequency in t tauri disks , a large number of t tauri disks with near ir excesses not indicating transitional disks but with 10@xmath0 features indicating low crystallinity , like fm tau , will be observed .",
    "both giant planet formation and crystallization can depend on the disk / star mass ratio , but crystallized dust can be removed after the planet forms .    in a future paper , the relative abundances of various dust species in a larger sample of t tauri disks will be quantified , and the abundances of dust species will be compared to other dust species and also to various stellar properties . another goal is to incorporate the best - fit dust cross - sections for our t tauri objects into the sophisticated radiative transfer models described by @xcite , and @xcite to model these objects seds and spectra self - consistently over much wider wavelength ranges .",

    "in our attempts to fit the dust emission feature at @xmath611.3@xmath0 in many of our emissivities , we unexpectedly found a very close resemblance between the opacity profile of forsterite grains with a cde shape distribution and that of porous forsterite grains with a volume fraction of vacuum @xmath60=0.6 ( i.e. 60% of the grain volume is vacuum ) and a fractal dimension of @xmath54=2.766 .",
    "for these porous grains , we used the bruggeman effective medium theory ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) and the dielectric constants of forsterite of @xcite to generate the effective dielectric constants for each crystalline axis . for a given crystalline axis ,",
    "we generate opacity from mie theory using the effective dielectric constants for that axis , assuming a spherical grain radius of 0.1@xmath0 .",
    "we then obtain the opacity for the porous forsterite grain by averaging the opacities of all three crystalline axes .",
    "the resulting porous forsterite opacity is nearly identical to that derived using the same set of dielectric constants and assuming a cde shape distribution ( figure 14 ) .",
    "we made the same comparison using parameters for the ordinary and extraordinary rays of @xmath13 quartz ( wenrich & christensen 1996 ) .",
    "as for forsterite , we used @xmath60=0.6 , @xmath54=2.766 , and grain radius of 0.1@xmath0 ; however , for quartz we add the sum of of the opacity generated from the ordinary ray and of that from the extraordinary ray .",
    "as for forsterite , the quartz opacities generated assuming porous grains and grains with a cde distribution are nearly identical ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "this suggests that the near - equivalence of the bruggeman emt plus mie theory to cde is mathematical in nature and not specific to the optical properties of the dust material in question .",
