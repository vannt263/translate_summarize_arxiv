    "the experimental preparation of fock states in a microwave cavity @xcite is a crucial step towards a systematic study of correlated many - body systems with photonic states .",
    "once a fock state has been prepared , we can change the parameters of the system and study the evolution of the fock state within the hilbert space that is provided by the eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the new system .",
    "this can be realized , for instance , in an experiment with two microwave cavities .",
    "the system is prepared such that one cavity has @xmath0 photons , the other cavity has no photon .",
    "then the initial fock state @xmath1 is assumed to be the groundstate of a hamiltonian @xmath2 . at the time @xmath3 the hamiltonian @xmath2 is switched to the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "this problem has been studied intensively for atomic systems , using the hubbard model and related models @xcite . in the case of two microwave cavities",
    "this switch can be realized by connecting the two isolated cavities with an optical fiber .",
    "then @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the isolated cavities , and @xmath4 is the hamiltonian of the connected cavities .",
    "this type of system , including atomic degress of freedom , was studied recently within a hartree - fock approximation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall study the dynamics of photons which tunnel between two microwave cavities through an optical fiber ( cf .",
    "[ cavities ] ) .",
    "the effect of atoms inside the cavities is approximated by an anharmonic photonic term .",
    "a central question is the effect of this anharmonicity on the evolution and whether or not the spectral properties depend on the initial conditions .",
    "we consider a system which is isolated from the environment . in terms of photonic states this can be realized by an ideal microwave cavity .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the system lives in an @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space . with the initial state @xmath6",
    "we obtain for the time evolution of the state @xmath7 or the evolution of the return probability @xmath8 with the amplitude _ 0|_t=_0|e^-iht|_0  .",

    "these polynomials can be evaluated by the recursive projection method ( rpm ) @xcite .",
    "this method is based on a systematic expansion of the resolvent @xmath17 , starting from the initial state @xmath6 .",
    "the method can also be understood as a random walk in hilbert space . however , there is a crucial difference in comparison with the conventional random walk because the rpm has a prefered direction : the walk of the rpm visits a subspace @xmath18 only once and never returns to it .",
    "a step from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath4 in such a way that @xmath19 is created by acting @xmath4 on @xmath18 . in terms of @xmath0 photons ,",
    "distributed over two microwave cavities , these subspaces are given by the basis @xmath20 , and the a step is an exchange of a single photon .",
    "thus , the walk follows a path with increasing numbers @xmath21 .",
    "this is the main advantage of the rpm that allows us to calculate the resolvent @xmath17 on a @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space exactly . in case of the photons in two microwave cavities",
    "the rpm is efficient for values of @xmath0 up to the order of @xmath22 .",

    "the superposition of many fock states can lead to a more complex behavior , such as a collapse and revival dynamics @xcite . ignoring the atomic degrees of freedom , the effect of the atom on the photonic spectrum is the additional square - root term in eq .",

    "the presence of many atoms in the cavity is quite complex due the presence of the atomic degrees of freedom .",

    "this leads to a recurrence relation which can accommodate the fock states @xmath1 , @xmath25 . in terms of pauli matrices",
