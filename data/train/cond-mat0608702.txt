    "the study of complex networks has applications in various fields including biology and engineering , and attracts growing attention @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "much progress has been reached in understanding complexity of network architectures that represent skeletons of networks . however , not only the architecture but also the dynamics taking place in a network is important @xcite .",
    "this dynamics determines _ functions _ of the networks , related , e.g. , to information processing in the brain ( which is a network of neurons ) or to the production process in a factory ( which is a network of machines ) .",
    "most of the real - world networks are constructed in such a way that they implement certain desired dynamical behaviors .",
    "not only the individual components of a network ( such as single neurons ) , but also the network architecture ( e.g. , connections between neurons ) should be appropriately designed .",
    "thus , it should be expected that real - world networks have architectures reflecting their desired dynamical behaviors .",
    "if one can extract topological properties of the networks relevant for their desired dynamics , this may provide insights into the _ meaning _ of network architecture from the viewpoint of dynamics and help to understand the design principles of functional networks .    in the present study ,",
    "the focus is on the synchronization of oscillators coupled into complex networks .",
    "synchronization plays a crucial role in functioning of various systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing examples is the circadian ( i.e. , approximately daily ) clock in mammals @xcite .",
    "the circadian rhythms of the whole body are orchestrated by a central clock in the brain , called the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) .",
    "this brain tissue is formed by a population of special neurons , known as clock cells .",
    "a single clock cell exhibits a robust circadian rhythm in its firing rate and thus each such cell is a self - sustained oscillator ( with oscillations determined by a regulatory loop in a group of genes at the single - cell level ) . in the scn ,",
    "neurons mutually synchronize their physiological rhythms even in absence of any environmental assistance @xcite , so that this cell population can generate collective periodic signal .",
    "additionally , a different kind of synchronization takes place in the scn which represents entrainment to environmental rhythms .",
    "( here and below , we use the term entrainment  to describe synchronization to an external input , distinguishing it from autonomous mutual synchronization ) .",
    "the entrainment of the scn is essential for the proper functioning of this biological clock .",
    "generally , the intrinsic period of the circadian rhythm is significantly different from 24 hours ( in humans , it would typically be 25 h ) .",
    "therefore , it must be tuned to the 24 h period through some external influences . moreover",
    ", the phase of circadian oscillations needs to be locked appropriately to the local time .",
    "the entrainment to the environment is mediated by the light information coming from the eyes , which acts as external periodic forcing for the scn .",
    "however , only a distinct subset of neurons receives and processes this light information , which implies that the rest of the population should be indirectly entrained via intercellular communication ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are various types of intercellular communication inside the scn , including the communication through several types of neurotransmitters @xcite .",
    "the communication through neurotransmitters goes via chemical synapses of neurons forming a complex directed network .    with respect to mutual synchronization of oscillators",
    ", the impact of the network architecture has been intensively investigated in recent years @xcite . however , only a few studies have dealt so far with the entrainment ( i.e. , synchronization to external periodic forcing ) of oscillator networks @xcite . the objective of the present paper is to identify principal topological properties that determine the entrainment ability of oscillator networks and to find the dependence of the entrainment ability on these topological properties .",
    "although the problem is motivated by the scn , our interest is more general .",
    "therefore , we use the phase oscillator model @xcite , which provides a good approximation of a broad class of coupled oscillator systems and is expected to yield general insight into the entrainment phenomena . in the earlier letter ,",
    "a particular phase oscillator model has been studied and it was found that , in this model , the entrainment threshold for the coupling intensity between oscillators increases exponentially with the _ depth of a network _ , defined as the mean forward distance from a pacemaker ( i.e. , source of external forcing ) to the network nodes @xcite .",
    "hence , it was found that the entrainment is practically only possible for the shallow networks with low hierarchical organization .",
    "here , we give all details of the derivations , extend the analysis to different network models and demonstrate the universality of the earlier preliminary results .",
    "additionally , a new class of random networks is considered , which allows further to explore the design principles of entrainable networks .",
    "the optimization of the network architecture with respect to the entrainment through a dynamical learning process is further performed .",
    "the article is organized as follows : the model is introduced in sec .",
    "sec : model .",
    "then , we first show numerical results obtained for standard random networks in sec .  [ sec : numerical ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] , the model is analytically investigated under a certain approximation for the network architecture .",
    "the comparison with numerical results is also provided . in sec .",
    "[ sec : directivity ] , a different class of random networks is introduced , i.e. _ directionally biased networks _ , and it is shown that the entrainment is strongly enhanced for the networks close to the feedforward - type . in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] , dynamical evolution of the network architecture using two kinds of learning algorithms is considered .",
    "the results are discussed , with a special emphasis on the design principles of biological clocks , in sec .",

    "we consider a system of @xmath0 phase oscillators , one of them being a pacemaker .",
    "the basic model is given by a set of evolution equations for the oscillator phases @xmath1 and the pacemaker phase @xmath2 , @xmath3the topology of network connections is determined by the adjacency matrix @xmath4 whose elements @xmath5 are either @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "the mean degree @xmath8 is the average number of incoming connections per node ( and @xmath9 is called the connectivity ) .",
    "the element with @xmath10 is special and represents a pacemaker .",
    "its frequency is increased by @xmath11 with respect to the frequency @xmath12 of all other oscillators .",
    "the pacemaker is acting on the oscillators @xmath13 , the action being specified by the coefficients @xmath14 taking @xmath6 for @xmath13 and @xmath7 otherwise .",
    "the coupling between elements inside the network is characterized by the coupling function @xmath15 and the ( positive ) coupling intensity coefficient @xmath16 . in absence of a pacemaker ,",
    "such networks undergo autonomous phase synchronization at the natural frequency @xmath12 if the coupling is attracting , i.e. , if @xmath17 . the coupling to the pacemaker is characterized by the @xmath18-periodic function @xmath19 and the ( positive ) intensity coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that functions @xmath15 and @xmath19 are @xmath18-periodic , nonconstant , and smooth .    without loss of generality , our model can be simplified . by going into a rotating frame",
    ", we have @xmath21 .",
    "the maxima of the coupling function , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are chosen equal to unity by properly defining the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath20 . moreover ,",

    ". however , the results in the present paper hold also for @xmath26 because of the following reason . the system ( 1 ) is invariant under transformation @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29,@xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "it will be turned out that the entrainment behavior does not depend on the explicit form of @xmath32 provided that @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the same entrainment behavior takes place also for @xmath26 .",
    "however , in this case , the role of @xmath33 is replaced by @xmath34 , so that @xmath34 should be put unity by properly rescaling @xmath16 . ] .",
    "after that , the model takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) with @xmath35 and @xmath21 ( below , we drop primes in the notations for the rescaled quantities ) .",
    "note that , in terms of the original model ( [ model ] ) , an increase of the rescaled coupling between the elements corresponds either to an increase of coupling @xmath16 or to a decrease of the relative pacemaker frequency @xmath36 .",
    "the presence of a pacemaker imposes hierarchical organization in the network architecture , which plays a crucial role in determining the entrainment ability . for any node @xmath37",
    ", its distance @xmath38 with respect to the pacemaker is defined by the length of the minimum _ forward _ path separating this node from the pacemaker .",
    "thus , the whole network is divided into a set of _ shells _ ,",
    "each of which is composed by oscillators with the distance @xmath38 from the pacemaker .",
    "the shell population @xmath39 is given by the number of the oscillators with distance @xmath38 .",
    "the _ depth _ @xmath40 of a network is introduced as @xmath41which is the average distance from the pacemaker to the entire network .",
    "we may classify the types of connections into _ forward , backward _ , and _ intra - shell connections _",
    ", which are , respectively , connections from the nodes in a certain shell @xmath38 to the nodes in the next shell @xmath42 , from the nodes in a certain shell @xmath38 to the nodes in the shallower shells @xmath43 , and between the nodes inside the same shell .",
    "we call the connections coming from a certain node the _ outgoing connections _ of the node , and the connections received by a certain node the _ incoming connections _ of the node .    in the analysis of the model , several further assumptions will be made .",
    "the number @xmath44 of elements , directly connected to the pacemaker , is assumed to be small as compared with the total size @xmath45 of the network .",
    "the mean degree @xmath8 is chosen large enough , so that the networks do not become disconnected .",
    "we assume @xmath46 which implies that coupling between connected oscillators vanishes when their phases are synchronized .",
    "moreover , coupling of the elements to the pacemaker is chosen to be much stronger than coupling between the elements in the rest of the network ( @xmath47 ) . in all the numerical simulations performed in the present paper , instead of using eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) we put @xmath48 for @xmath49 , corresponding to the the limit @xmath50 .",
    "we begin our analysis of entrainment phenomena by considering the important special case of standard random networks , also known as erds - rnyi ( er ) networks @xcite .",
    "these networks are generated by independently assigning with probability @xmath9 @xmath51 for any pair @xmath37 and @xmath52 of the network nodes a connection that leads from the node @xmath37 to the node @xmath52 .",
    "hence , elements @xmath5 of the adjacency matrix @xmath53 are chosen to be @xmath6 with probability @xmath9 and @xmath7 otherwise , and @xmath53 is asymmetric in general . only sparse random networks with a small mean degree @xmath8 @xmath54 will be considered .",
    "we use the following coupling function @xmath55where @xmath56 is constant . note that @xmath46 and @xmath57 for any @xmath56 .",
    "note also that for @xmath58 this coupling function is the same as that used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are started with random phases for the oscillators @xmath59 .",
    "for each oscillator , its effective long - time frequency @xmath60 is computed as @xmath61with sufficiently large @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "numerical simulations show that the response of a network to the introduction of a pacemaker depends on the strength @xmath16 of coupling between the oscillators . when this coupling is sufficiently large , the pacemaker entrains the whole network ( i.e. , @xmath64 for any @xmath37 ) . under entrainment ,",
    "the relative phases @xmath65 are locked . as the coupling strength @xmath16 is decreased , the entrainment breaks down at a certain threshold value @xmath66 ( for @xmath58 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : below ] ) .",
    "our simulations show that , in most cases , synchronization between the first and the second shells is the first to break down , and the frequencies of oscillators in the shells @xmath67 remain equal for any @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "the results for @xmath70 and @xmath71 are similar .",
    "figure [ fig : kcr ] displays the thresholds @xmath66 ( in the logarithmic scale ) for a large set of networks with the fixed mean degree @xmath72 and different numbers @xmath44 of oscillators in the first shell . as can be seen , the entrainment threshold @xmath66 may vary largely for different network realizations even if @xmath44 is fixed .",
    "the results for @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are labeled as a , b and c. the same set of networks is used for all three values of @xmath56 . for a given network",
    ", the entrainment thresholds obtained for different values of @xmath56 are close , implying that the entrainment threshold does not depend on the particular form of the coupling function .",
    "each group of networks with a certain @xmath44 is displayed with its own symbol .",
    "each group is characterized by a distribution of depths @xmath40 and generates therefore a cluster of data points .",
    "correlation between the entrainment threshold @xmath66 and the network depth @xmath40 is evident even within a fixed @xmath44 .",
    "the distributions inside each cluster and the accumulation of the clusters yield the dependence @xmath75 of the entrainment threshold on the network depth .",
    "remarkably , the observed dependence is well numerically approximated by the exponential law @xmath76    the same functional dependence is found for networks of other system sizes and different average mean degrees @xmath8 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kcr - other ] ) .",
    "the entrainment thresholds for @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be well fitted by the same function with the same fitting parameter @xmath79 , which suggests that the entrainment threshold depends not explicitly on the system size @xmath80 but on the average degree @xmath8 .",
    "next we consider relaxation to the entrained state .",
    "the relaxation time for each generated network has been measured as follows .",
    "first , we have run a numerical simulation for a long time starting with a random initial distribution of phases . if the relative phases @xmath81 for all @xmath37 were not locked at the end of the simulation ( implying that the network did not become entrained for the chosen coupling intensity ) , such a network has been discarded .",
    "then , the simulation was repeated starting from the initial condition @xmath82 for @xmath59 , where @xmath83 is a random number independently taken from the uniform distribution within @xmath84 @xmath85 is a small coefficient and @xmath86 are the relative phases of oscillators in the entrained state .",
    "the time dependence of the distance @xmath87 has been monitored .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath88 was defined as the time @xmath89 at which the ratio @xmath90 becomes equal to @xmath91 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tau ] displays the relaxation times @xmath88 ( in the logarithmic scale ) , obtained numerically for a large set of networks and for a fixed coupling strength @xmath16 . again , exponential dependence on the depth is evident .",
    "this dependence is well fitted by the function @xmath92there is a divergence of the relaxation time around @xmath93 .",
    "this divergence occurs around the region of the depth where given coupling strength @xmath16 is close to the entrainment threshold , i.e. , @xmath94 . above this region , entrainment rarely happens .",
    "eigenvalues of an entrained state are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen ] . they were obtained by numerically solving the stability matrix of our model ( [ model ] ) .",
    "we have assumed the limit @xmath95 and perturbations are considered only in the subsystem @xmath59 , so that there are @xmath96 eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvalue possessing the maximum real part is denoted by @xmath97 .",
    "as seen , the magnitude of the real part of this eigenvalue , @xmath98 , is much smaller than those of others ( which are distributed around @xmath99 ) .",
    "we have preliminarily checked the eigenvectors and found that the associated eigenvector with @xmath97 corresponds to an approximately identical phase shift of the whole subsystem @xmath59 , and the rest eigenvectors correspond to relative motions inside this subsystem .",
    "this suggests the following relaxation process : relative perturbations inside the subsystem quickly diminish within the characteristic time scale @xmath100 and , then , the phase differences between the oscillators in the subsystem become practically locked . the relaxation of the phase difference between the first shell and the subsystem proceeds slowly with the time scale @xmath101 .",
    "such behavior has actually been observed in our numerical simulations .",
    "the results relating to the relaxation process do not change qualitatively for different values of @xmath56 ( we have further checked them for @xmath102 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "note also that the relaxation time does not depend on the particular form of small perturbations .",
    "in this section , the model is analytically investigated using the heuristic global tree approximation .",
    "first , global tree networks will be introduced and then their similarity to the er networks will be explained .",
    "after that , the analytical solution of the entrainment problem for global tree networks will be constructed .",
    "note that this analytical solution will hold only in the limit when both @xmath8 and @xmath45 are large .",
    "a global tree network is a hierarchical network where , in any level , each oscillator has only one incoming connection from the higher level and exactly @xmath8 outgoing connections leading to the lower level .",
    "additionally , each oscillator has exactly @xmath8 connections from the last ( bottom ) shell of this hierarchical network .",
    "no other connections exist and the precise connection topology remains arbitrary .",
    "an example of a global tree network with @xmath103 hierarchical levels is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] .    for such networks , shell populations grow exponentially ,",
    "i.e. as @xmath104 with the distance @xmath38 from the network origin .",
    "the total number @xmath105 of shells is determined by the condition @xmath106 .",
    "the depth of such a network is given by @xmath107 .",
    "thus , for @xmath8 @xmath108 , the depth @xmath40 coincides with the number of shells @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , @xmath105 can be approximately replaced by @xmath40 .",
    "global tree networks share essential properties with the er networks of large size @xmath109 and high connectivity @xmath110 this similarity is briefly explained below ( see appendix  [ sec : withouttree ] for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we first consider the pattern of forward connections of the er network . by definition of our model ,",
    "each node in the first shell receives one forward connection from the pacemaker .",
    "each node typically gives @xmath8 outward connections .",
    "thus , from the first shell , a total number of the outward connections is @xmath111 on the average .",
    "all elements receiving a connection from the first shell form the second shell of the network .",
    "if the number of connections leading from the first shell is much smaller than the total number @xmath45 of elements to which they may lead ( i.e. , if @xmath112 ) , each next outward connection from the first shell is typically received by a different node in the second shell .",
    "this means that , typically , an element in the second shell would be linked only to a single element in the first shell , as required by the tree structure .",
    "considering the third shell , we can notice that again that , if the number @xmath113 of outgoing connections from this shell is small as compared with the network size @xmath45 , the tree structure would approximately hold for this shell too .",
    "shell populations @xmath39 grow exponentially with the number @xmath38 of the shell , i.e. @xmath104 . the tree structure with respect to forward connections holds so far as these populations remain much smaller than the total network size .",
    "when @xmath8 is large , it can be shown that only the last two shells have populations of size @xmath114 and , thus , the tree structure approximately holds down to the third last shell . analyzing further patterns of backward and intra - shell connections in a large er network",
    ", we notice that populations of all shells , except the last of them , are of order @xmath115 and only the populations of the two last shells are of order @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , each node outside of the last two shells receives backward connections mostly from these last two shells . on the average ,",
    "the number of such connections is @xmath8 .",
    "each node in the last two shells typically has @xmath8 incoming connections from the last two shells .",
    "this large number of connections between the last two shells strongly facilitates synchronization of oscillators inside them , as can be seen in numerical simulations . having this in mind",
    ", we may merge the last two shells in the network into a single shell .",
    "once this additional ( empirical ) approximation is used , the tree structure is extended to the entire network , including its last shells .",
    "thus , in the _ global tree approximation _ the er network is treated as a network having a tree structure with respect to forward connections and with the backward connections arriving only from the last network shell . in this network ,",
    "every forward path starting from the pacemaker has a similar structure , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - tree ] .    when this approximation is used , analytical solution can be easily constructed and its properties become more clear .",
    "therefore , we prefer first to present our analysis using the global approximation , even also it remains partly empirical .",
    "the investigation for er networks can also be performed without relying on the tree approximation . while giving quantitatively better results , this other analytical investigation is however more complicated and , therefore , we give it separately in appendix a.      in the considered tree networks , our model ( [ model ] ) can be written as @xmath116@xmath117where @xmath67 ; @xmath118 is the phase of the oscillator @xmath37 in the shell @xmath38 ; @xmath119 is the oscillator giving forward connection to the oscillator @xmath37 in the shell @xmath38 ; and the summation is taken over all the oscillator @xmath52 in the last shell @xmath40 . because each oscillator in any particular shell has the same pattern of connections , i.e. , one forward connection from the previous shell and @xmath8 backward connections from the last shell .",
    "thus , the entrained state of a network with phase synchronization inside every shell is possible .",
    "for such a state , the entrainment solution problem is reduced into that in the one - dimensional oscillator array along a forward path starting from the pacemaker ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - tree ] ) .",
    "putting @xmath120 ( which is the entrainment condition ) and @xmath121 for all the oscillator @xmath37 in the shell @xmath38 , we get the following algebraic equations : @xmath122@xmath123for large @xmath8 , we may linearize @xmath124 as @xmath125 for @xmath126 [ it will be shown that @xmath127 is at most of order @xmath128 in the solution under entrainment , so that this linearizion is justified ]",
    ". we may then solve eq .",
    "( [ reducedmodel2 ] ) from the last shell upward . for @xmath129 , we get @xmath130substitution this into eq .",

    "( [ reducedmodel1 ] ) , we also obtain @xmath136note that the explicit expression for @xmath137 is not needed .",
    "the existence conditions of the entrained solution are @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "the former condition is satisfied for @xmath47 ( which is our assumption ) . among the terms @xmath141 ,",
    "the term @xmath142 is the largest one .",
    "the solution thus exists if @xmath143therefore , the entrained state of the network is possible only if the coupling intensity @xmath16 satisfies condition @xmath144 , where @xmath145    the result ( [ kcr ] ) is remarkable .",
    "according to it , the coupling threshold @xmath66 is determined exclusively by topological properties and does not depend on a particular form of the coupling function .",
    "moreover , it is given only through a combination of @xmath8 and @xmath40 .",
    "this fact suggests that the essential parameters of the system are @xmath8 and @xmath40 rather than @xmath146 and @xmath44 , in agreement with the previous numerical results obtained for the er networks .    from eq .",
    "( [ kcr ] ) , @xmath66 for our tree network under consideration is roughly estimated as @xmath147thus , @xmath66 is a large number for small @xmath44 ( as we assumed ) .",
    "this property will be used in the derivation of the relaxation time .",
    "one can verify that @xmath127 is at most of order @xmath148 in the entrained state by substituting @xmath66 into @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) .",
    "note also that although the phase differences @xmath149 are small in deeper shells , they should not be neglected when the entrainment threshold is derived , because the phase difference @xmath150 ( which determines the existence condition of the entrained solution ) is a consequence of the exponential growth of such small phase differences from the deepest shell upwards .      to analyze stability of the entrained solution , only the limit @xmath95 is considered ( so that @xmath151 for @xmath152 ) . in numerical simulations ,",
    "we have observed that the relaxation process is characterized by two distinct time scales : the first one characterizes fast relaxation inside the subsystem @xmath59 and the other corresponds to slow relaxation in the phase difference between the first shell and the subsystem . in this section , we first investigate the _ internal _ stability of the subsystem .",
    "then , taking advantage of the separation of time scales , we heuristically construct the effective dynamical equation of the whole subsystem .",
    "we consider small perturbations for phases in the entrained state , i.e. , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is small perturbation .",
    "because of the assumption @xmath95 , we put @xmath155 , i.e. , @xmath156 . the model ( [ model2 ] ) for @xmath67 then gives @xmath157because @xmath158 , we approximate @xmath159 .",
    "in addition , because of the large number @xmath8 of connections from the last shell , we may approximate @xmath160using these two approximations , eq .",
    "( [ model3 ] ) reduces to @xmath161since the first term is negligibly small for large @xmath8 for any shell @xmath162 , eq .",
    "( [ model4 ] ) is further approximated as @xmath163thus , in our approximation , all eigenvalues associated with the relative motion inside the subsystem are degenerated into @xmath164with degeneracy @xmath165 . the dynamical equation ( [ model5 ] ) describes the fast relaxation inside the subsystem : oscillators quickly relaxes to the average perturbation @xmath166 in the last shell , i.e. , @xmath167 .",
    "after this fast relaxation , the phase differences inside the subsystem are almost locked .",
    "now we heuristically construct the dynamical equation for the phase difference between the first shell and the subsystem .",
    "we take the coordinate of the subsystem on its _ surface _ ,",
    "i.e. , the phase of the second shell , defined as @xmath168 . because the total external force applied to the subsystem is given by @xmath169 , the effective dynamical equation for the surface @xmath170 reads @xmath171 here , the _ effective size _ @xmath172 of the whole network is determined by the condition that @xmath173 when the subsystem is entrained ( i.e. @xmath174 ) . from this condition , comparing eq .",

    "thus , provided that @xmath17 , a stable entrained solution exists for @xmath180 .",
    "this implies that the entrainment breakdown occurs only via the disappearance of the solution at @xmath181 .    because @xmath182 is a large number for small @xmath183 [ see eq .",

    "this fact justifies the approximation employed in this subsection .",
    "in addition , the relaxation time against any general perturbation is thus given simply by @xmath185 hence , in general , the relaxation time depends on the explicit form of the coupling function , being different from the case of the entrainment threshold .",

    "moreover , the number ( @xmath8 ) of the backward connections is much larger than the number ( one ) of the forward connections .",
    "thus , to compensate such strong unbalance , the phase difference associated with the forward connection ( @xmath217 ) needs to be much larger that that associated with the backward connections ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "the effect accumulates exponentially along a forward path of the length @xmath40 starting from the pacemaker and ending at the last shell .",
    "this accumulation results in the exponential growth the phase difference from the last shell upwards , and thus , the exponential dependence of the entrainment threshold on the depth @xmath40 .",

    "it is thus expected that the entrainment threshold decreases significantly for the networks that are closer to the feedforward architecture ( i.e. , to a network without backward connections ) .",

    "we put @xmath242 for @xmath152 . throughout the evolution process",

    "then , the adjacency matrix @xmath244 is mutated .",
    "this is done by rewiring : we choose randomly an existing directed link ( @xmath245 ) and eliminate it ( @xmath246 ) , and then , choose randomly a missing link ( @xmath247 where @xmath248 ) and add a new connection there ( @xmath249 ) .",

    "if @xmath251 is closer to @xmath6 than @xmath252 , the mutation is accepted . otherwise , the network is reset to its structure before the mutation .",
    "the iteration process is repeated until the long - time frequency @xmath252 becomes equal to unity .    a typical dependence of the average frequency and two different topological properties during an evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : learn]a .",
    "the tendency to decrease both the depth @xmath40 and the backward connectivity @xmath219 is evident . in the most of evolutions where the average frequency @xmath253 has increased , a decrease in @xmath40 and/or @xmath219 was observed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : learn]b , evolution of two other topological properties is shown .",
    "we see that the correlation between the feedforward connectivity @xmath240 and the mean frequency @xmath252 is weak .",

    "thus , in this evolutionary process , the mutation is done according to the individual activities of the oscillators .",
    "note also that , in this evolution algorithm , the total number of incoming connections for each oscillator is maintained constant .",
    "figure  [ fig : learn2]a displays typical dependence of the average frequency and two topological properties of the networks during a single evolution .",
    "although the average frequency @xmath252 of the whole population does not always increase in each iteration step , the network architecture changes during the evolution similar to what has been found for the first algorithm , towards the networks of smaller depth @xmath40 and smaller backward connectivity @xmath219 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : learn2]b , emergence of a hub and weak correlation between @xmath252 and @xmath261 are seen , similarly to the results in the first algorithm .",
    "it should be emphasized that , in the second algorithm , globally coordinated network architecture emerges solely through the judgmentsof individual oscillators based only on their own activity .",
    "the reason why this _ local _ optimization rule leads to the _ globally _ coordinated structure is that the oscillators are mutually frequency - synchronized in most cases and therefore their individual frequencies usually coincide with the average frequency of the whole population .",
    "hence , the second algorithm also works similarly to the first one .    in both types of algorithms ,",
    "our numerical results show that the development of the entrainment ability is followed by decreases in the depth @xmath40 and the backward connectivity @xmath219 , suggesting that these two topological properties are the primary factors in determining the entrainment ability .",
    "it can be also noticed that the evolving networks tend to develop strong heterogeneity in their outgoing degrees . the depth of an evolving network becomes smaller via an increase in the outgoing degrees of nodes in the shallow shells . in this manner",
    ", hubs of outgoing connections are formed . on the other hand ,",
    "the development of small backward connectivity is mainly due to a decrease of the outgoing degrees in the deep shells .",
    "consequently , the heterogeneity of outgoing degrees tends to be larger as the optimization process goes on .",
    "many real - world networks , including scale - free networks , are known to have strong heterogeneity in their degrees @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that evolving networks with good entrainment ability also become strongly heterogeneous .",
    "as already mentioned in sec .  [ sec : introduction ] , our study is motivated by the scn , the tissue orchestrating the circadian rhythms of the whole body in mammals . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the neural network structure of the scn and its possible roles from the viewpoint of the results of the present investigations .",
    "the scn is anatomically organized into two groups , often called the `` subdivision and the '' subdivision ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "only the `` core '' subdivision receives photic input and , thus , this part corresponds to the first shell in our model .",
    "the `` shell '' subdivision corresponds to the rest of the shells in our model . within and between the `` core '' and the `` shell '' subdivisions ,",
    "there are several types of inter - cellular communications which influence circadian oscillations @xcite .",
    "the pathways ( i.e. , the network structure ) of each type of communication may be different .    from the viewpoint of our results ,",
    "if the scn is constructed so as to reach the best ability for entrainment , the network architecture should be feedforward .",
    "this means that the unidirectional connectivity from the `` core '' subdivision to the `` shell '' subdivision should be found .",
    "this is indeed the case for communication via vip ( _ vasoactive intestinal polypeptide _ ) , which is a neurotransmitter released only by neurons in the core subdivision .",
    "vip is one of the leading candidate factors for the synchronization pathway inside the scn @xcite .",
    "however , vip is not the only one communication agent .",
    "communication via gaba ( @xmath262 -aminobutyric acid ) is further possible for almost all neurons in the scn and seems to play a crucial role in achieving synchronization between the `` core '' and the `` shell '' subdivisions @xcite .",
    "the gaba connection pattern is not feedforward but bidirectional between these subdivisions .",
    "however , remarkably , it has been conjectured from experimental studies that coupling from the `` shell '' to the `` core '' is weaker than in the other direction @xcite , suggesting that the network would effectively be close to feedforward one also with respect to the gaba communication .",
    "it is known moreover that , although the response of the `` core '' structure to a sudden phase shift in the environment is very fast , the response of the `` shell '' subdivision to such phase shifts is significantly slower nagano03,albus05 . from the viewpoint of our results",
    ", it can be conjectured that the slow response of the `` shell '' subdivision is due to the more hierarchical , non - feedforward organization of neurons inside this subdivision . as we have seen ,",
    "if a network is hierarchical , the response can become very slow even if the first shell is strongly connected to the environment .",
    "it is interesting to ask why the `` shell '' subdivision , coupled to the `` core '' , actually exists in the scn and why this subdivision could be more hierarchically organized .",
    "one reason may be that such an organization is needed to keep the autonomy of the biological clock .",
    "the scn must be capable to synchronize to the environmental rhythm , but , on the other hand , should not be too sensitive to the environmental information .",
    "in other words , the scn must possess both autonomy and adaptivity in a good balance .",
    "the hierarchical organization and directionality of the network architecture in the scn could be useful to reconcile these contradicting requirements .",
    "our main result for the random er networks and the random directionally biased networks is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tongue ] , where @xmath16 is non - rescaled coupling strength , i.e. , @xmath263 in the original model ( [ model ] ) .",
    "the entrainment occurs in a gray region . for the er networks ,",
    "this region becomes exponentially smaller for the networks of higher hierarchical organizations ( i.e. , with larger depth @xmath40 ) .",
    "thus , in practice , the entrainment is possible only for shallow networks .",
    "for the directionally biased networks , the entrainment region becomes significantly enlarged for the smaller backward connectivity @xmath264 even if the networks are hierarchical .",
    "the feedforward network is the best one for the entrainment .",
    "the relaxation time to the entrainment has approximately the same dependence on the network architecture as that of the entrainment threshold .",
    "these results are general and hold for a large class of coupled phase - oscillator systems ( and thus also of weakly coupled limit - cycle oscillator systems ) with attracting couplings .",
    "the networks with such topological properties are shown to emerge naturally through different kinds of evolutions aimed at increasing the entrainment ability .",

    "although this systematic derivation is more accurate , it is also more technical and , therefore , we have preferred to present first , in the main part of the article , the analysis based on the global tree approximation .",
    "the results of this derivation agree with what we have found before in the global tree approximation and can be viewed as providing further support for it .",

    "the same property holds up to a certain shell @xmath274 , where for the first time the total number of outgoing connections from the shell becomes of the order @xmath114 or larger , i.e. , @xmath275 and @xmath276 .",
    "we thus have @xmath277 and @xmath278 for @xmath279 .",

    "( [ kcr ] ) , we obtain @xmath350 , which is about @xmath351 and @xmath352 respectively for @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",

    "every oscillator then receives only one forward connection . by assuming @xmath265 , every oscillator ( except those in the last shell ) receives approximately @xmath8 backward connections",
    "therefore , the only difference from the er directed networks is that backward connections come not from the last shell but from the next shell .",
    "thus , we get the following equations : @xmath361@xmath362@xmath363using the approximations available for large @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath364the entrainment thresholds is thus @xmath365stability analysis can also be performed in a same manner as in sec .",
