    "recent studies have revealed that almost all massive galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) with a mass of @xmath16 at their centers .",
    "interestingly , their masses are strongly correlated with those of the spheroid component of their host galaxies , suggesting that galaxies and smbhs coevolve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "how did galaxies and smbhs form and evolve in the 13.7-billion - year history of the universe ?",
    "the mechanism for the co - evolution of galaxies and smbhs has not been well - constrained observationally , although it has been the subject of intense theoretical investigation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is in part because many previous studies have been based on optically selected samples . while deep x - ray ( e.g. , @xcite ) , radio ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and mid - infrared ( e.g. , @xcite ) studies can probe the heavily obscured galaxies that harbor actively growing black holes which are difficult to find optically , they do not cover enough sky to find many of the rarest , most luminous objects . for a full understanding of the physics of galaxy  smbh co - evolution , it is crucial to search for actively accreting galaxy  smbh systems which may be surrounded by heavy dust .",
    "here we focus on `` dust obscured galaxies '' ( dogs : @xcite ) as a key population to tackle the mystery of the co - evolution .",
    "dogs are very faint in the optical , but are bright in the ir .",
    "the original definition of dogs was @xmath17 > 7.5 $ ] where @xmath18 and [ 24 ] represent ab magnitudes in the @xmath18-band and 24 @xmath4 , respectively @xcite .",
    "their mid - ir ( mir ) flux densities are three orders of magnitude larger than those at optical wavelengths , which implies dust heating by significant star formation ( sf ) , an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , or both , and the bulk of the optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) emission from them is absorbed by dust .",
    "there are two sub - classes among the dogs , characterized by their optical - ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` power - law ( pl ) dogs '' show a continuous rise in flux density to longer wavelengths , for which ir color - color plots ( e.g. , @xcite ) imply the presence of agn activity in their nucleus .",
    "in contrast , the so - called `` bump dogs '' exhibit a rest - frame 1.6 @xmath4 flux excess that is probably due to the stellar photospheres of cooler stars , which implies that the energy source of their huge ir emission is dominated by sf activity .",
    "a possible key process for the co - evolution is a gas - rich galaxy merger , because the gas accumulating onto the nucleus triggers the quasar activity , whose energy then significantly affects the evolution of their host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , see also @xcite ) . in the context of this galaxy merger scenario , the central bhs and their host galaxies",
    "are obscured by a large amount of gas and dust during the initial stage of the co - evolution .",
    "interestingly , the dog color criterion is particularly sensitive to heavily reddened galaxies at @xmath19 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this redshift is an interesting epoch because the peak of sf and agn activity in the universe and the bulk of stellar mass assembly in galaxies occurred around this epoch ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a hydrodynamic simulation conducted by @xcite found that major mergers appear as pl dogs when the accretion rate on the bh peaks .",
    "according to @xcite , the fraction of pl dogs increases with 24 @xmath20 m brightness ; rising to almost 80% at 24 @xmath20 m flux @xmath15 1 mjy , although this fraction has an uncertainty of more than 20% .",
    "therefore , ir - bright dogs in particular could constitute a key population for understanding the co - evolution of galaxies and smbhs .",
    "however , efficient searches for luminous dogs have been difficult in previous surveys because ( i ) these objects are optically too faint to detect in optical bands , and ( ii ) they are spatially rare ( ( 2.82 @xmath8 0.05)@xmath9 10@xmath21@xmath22 mpc@xmath23 ; dey et al . 2008 ) because the timescale of the rapid growth of bhs in the growth phase is much shorter than that of the agn activity .",
    "therefore , high - sensitivity and wide - area surveys in both optical and mir are required to search for the most ir - bright dogs .    in this study",
    ", we perform a systematic search for ir - bright dogs based on wide and deep images in the optical and mir .",
    "the optical data are obtained with the hyper suprime - cam ( hsc : @xcite ) , a gigantic mosaic ccd camera with a 1.5 @xmath24 diameter fov , which is mounted at the prime focus of the subaru telescope .",
    "an ambitious hsc legacy survey is on - going , which will cover a wide area ( @xmath5 1,400 deg@xmath6 ) of the sky . a brief summary of the hsc ",
    "ssp may be found at the following web page : http://www.naoj.org/projects/hsc/surveyplan.html . ] .",
    "the expected sensitivity of this multi - band survey ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath27 ) is @xmath28 26 in ab magnitude , almost 40 times deeper than that of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : @xcite ) .",
    "the mir data are obtained from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise : @xcite ) , which was launched in 2009 .",
    "wise performed an all - sky survey with a high sensitivity in four bands , 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath20 m ; we will select dogs using the 22 @xmath20 m data . the 5@xmath29 detection limit at 22",
    "@xmath20 m is better than 6 mjy @xcite , which is over an order of magnitude fainter than those of previous ir all - sky survey data ( iras : @xcite , akari : @xcite ) .",

    ", we performed a search for ir - bright dogs using early hsc data covering @xmath5 9 deg@xmath6 , as a benchmark for future hsc studies of dogs .",
    "it has been suggested that most dogs represent a subclass of high - redshift ( @xmath30 2 ) optically - faint ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . though ulirgs are also important objects to study the coevolution of galaxies and smbhs , systematic searches for high - z ulirgs are difficult due to the confusion limit of far - ir ( fir ) imaging observations .",
    "the situation has been improved with the advent of capable instruments such as the submillimetre common - user bolometer array 2 ( scuba2 : @xcite ) but the confusion limit is still been severe especially for less luminous ulirgs .",
    "the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) will overcome the confusion problem even for less luminous ulirgs , although its small field of view means that it can not carry out wide - angle surveys .",
    "on the other hand , the rarity of dogs on the sky means that they are not affected by confusion , and thus they are a useful way to study the dusty population at @xmath31 2 statistically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sample_selection ] describes the sample selection of ir - bright dogs , and their basic properties such as their seds are presented in section [ results ] . in section [ discussion ] , we derive their total ir luminosity function ( lf ) and estimate their ir luminosity density ( ld ) .",

    "ssp s14a_0 early data , containing the positions and photometric information of objects detected by observations in march and april in 2014 .",
    "the hsc early data were mainly comprised of two catalogs ; a wide layer catalog that includes two band photometry ( @xmath2 and @xmath27 ) , and an ultradeep layer catalog that includes five band photometry ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath27 ) . in particular , we used a sample of 16,392,815 objects detected either in @xmath2-band or @xmath27-band in the wide layer catalog which covers the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama : driver et al .",

    "the expected limiting magnitude ( 5@xmath29 , diameter aperture ) for @xmath2- and @xmath27- band is approximately 26 and 24 in ab magnitude , respectively .",
    "the typical full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) for the @xmath2- and @xmath27- band data in this field is @xmath5 0.55 and 0.68 arcsec , respectively .",
    "the data observed by the hsc in the s14a run were analyzed through an early version of the hsc pipeline ( version 2.12.4d_hsc ) using codes from the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) software pipeline @xcite , developed by the hsc software team .",
    "this pipeline performs ccd - by - ccd reduction and calibration for astrometry and photometric zeropoints , mosaic - stacking which combines reduced ccd images into a large high s / n coadd image , and catalog generation for detecting and measuring sources on the coadd .",
    "the photometric calibration is based on data obtained from the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) 1 imaging survey @xcite . in this study , we employed the cmodel magnitude to estimate @xmath2-band flux , which is a weighted combination of exponential and de vaucouleurs fits to the light profile of each object ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we limited ourselves to those objects with clean @xmath2-band photometry and removed duplicates .",
    "in particular , we required : ( i ) objects are selected in @xmath2-band ( filter01 = `` hsc - i '' ) , ( ii ) they are completely isolated or were cleanly deblended ( deblend_nchild = 0 ) , ( iii ) they are unique objects ; repeat observations are removed ( flag_detect_is_tract_inner = `` true '' and flag_detect_is_patch_inner = `` true '' ) , ( iv ) none of the pixels in their footprint are interpolated ( flag_flags_pixel_edge = `` false '' ) , ( v ) none of the central 3@xmath93 pixels are saturated ( flag_flags_pixel_saturated_center = `` false '' ) , ( vi ) none of the central 3@xmath93 pixels are affected by cosmic - rays ( flag_flags_pixel_cr_center = `` false '' ) , ( vii ) there are no bad pixels in their footprint ( flag_flags_pixel_bad = `` false '' ) , ( viii ) there are no problems in measuring cmodel fluxes ( flag_cmodel_flux_flags = `` false '' ) , and ( ix ) they have a clean measurement of the centroid ( flag_centroid_sdss_flags = `` false '' ) .",

    ", we used the latest all - sky allwise catalog @xcite that achieved significantly better sensitivity in 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath4 than the wise all - sky data release @xcite due to improved data processing .",

    "hence we first joined the hsc data with nir data obtained from the viking catalog whose angular resolution is roughly comparable to that of the hsc ( @xmath43 1 arcsec ) , and we then adopted an optical - nir color cut to reject sources unlikely to be dogs before cross - matching with wise .",

    "<S> we present the photometric properties of a sample of infrared ( ir ) bright dust obscured galaxies ( dogs ) . combining wide and deep optical images obtained with the hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) on the subaru telescope and all - sky mid - ir ( mir ) images taken with wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , we discovered 48 dogs with @xmath0 and @xmath1 > 7.0 $ ] , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and [ 22 ] represent ab magnitude in the @xmath2-band , @xmath3-band , and 22 @xmath4 , respectively , in the gama 14hr field ( @xmath5 9 deg@xmath6 ) . among these objects , 31 </S>",

    "<S> assuming that the redshift distribution for our dogs sample is gaussian , with mean and sigma @xmath7 = 1.99 @xmath8 0.45 , we calculated their total ir luminosity using an empirical relation between 22 @xmath4 luminosity and total ir luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the average value of the total ir luminosity is ( 3.5 @xmath8 1.1 ) @xmath9 @xmath10 , which classifies them as hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( hylirgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also derived the total ir luminosity function ( lf ) and ir luminosity density ( ld ) for a flux - limited subsample of 18 dogs with 22 @xmath4 flux greater than 3.0 mjy and with @xmath2-band magnitude brighter than 24 ab magnitude . the derived space density for this subsample is log @xmath11 = -6.59 @xmath8 0.11 [ mpc@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the ir lf for dogs including data obtained from the literature is well fitted by a double - power law . </S>",
    "<S> the derived lower limit for the ir ld for our sample is @xmath13 @xmath5 3.8 @xmath9 10@xmath14 [ mpc@xmath12 and its contributions to the total ir ld , ir ld of all ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , and that of all dogs are @xmath15 3 % , @xmath15 9 % , and @xmath15 15 % , respectively . </S>"
