    "the integral quantum hall regime has traditionally been viewed as a ( nearly ) free particle localization problem with interactions playing only a minor role .",
    "@xcite although it is well known that many features of the experimental data , taken from low mobility heterostructures , @xcite can be explained as the behavior of free particles , a much sharper formulation of the problem is obtained by considering the quantum hall plateau transitions.@xcite following the experimental work by h.p wei et al.,@xcite these transitions behave in all respects like a disorder driven metal - insulator transition that is characterized by two independent critical indices , i.e. a _ localization length _ exponent @xmath3 and a _ phase breaking length _ exponent @xmath4.@xcite whereas transport measurements usually provide an experimental value of only the ratio @xmath9 , it is generally not known how the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be extracted separately .",
    "inspite of the fact that one can not proceed without having a microscopic theory of electron - electron interaction effects , there is nevertheless a strong empirical believe in the literature @xcite which says that the zero temperature localization length exponent @xmath10 is given precisely by the free electron value @xmath11 as obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite the experimental situation has not been sufficiently well understood , @xcite however , to justify the bold assumption of fermi liquid behavior .",
    "in fact , the progress that has been made over the last few years in the theory of localization and interaction effects clearly indicates that fermi liquid principles do not exist in general .",
    "the coulomb interaction problem lies in a different universality class of transport phenomena @xcite with a previously unrecognized symmetry , called @xmath12 invariance .",
    "@xcite the theory relies in many ways on the approach as initiated by finkelstein @xcite and adapted to the case of the spin polarized or spinless electrons.@xcite by reconciling the finkelstein theory with the topological concept of an instanton vacuum @xcite and the chern simons statistical gauge fields,@xcite the foundations have been laid for a complete renormalization theory that unifies the quantum theory of metals with that of the abelian quantum hall states.@xcite      the unification of the integral and fractional quantum hall regimes is based on the assumption that finkelstein approach @xcite is renormalizable and generates a strong coupling , _ insulating _ phase with a massgap .",
    "however , the traditional analyses of the finkelstein theory have actually not provided any garantee that this is indeed so .",
    "inspite of finkelstein s pioneering and deep contributions to the field , it is well known that the conventional momentum shell renormalization schemes do not facilitate any computations of the quantum theory beyond one loop order .",
    "at the same time , application of the more advanced technique of dimensional regularization has led to conceptual difficulties with such aspects like _ dynamical _ scaling.@xcite one can therefore not rule out the possibility that there are complications , either in the idea of renormalizability , or in other aspects of the theory such as the matsubara frequency technique .",
    "nothing much has been clarified , however , by repeating similar kinds of analyses in a different formalism , like the keldish technique.@xcite what has been lacking all along is the understanding of a fundamental principle that has prevented the finkelstein approach from becoming a fully fledged field theory for localization and interaction effects .      in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have shown that the finkelstein action has an exact symmetry ( @xmath12 invariance ) that is intimidly related to the electrodynamic @xmath13 gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "@xmath12 invariance is the basic mechanism that protects the renormalization of the problem with infinitely ranged interaction potentials such as the coulomb potential .",
    "moreover , it has turned out that the infrared behavior of physical observables can only be extracted from @xmath12 invariant quantities and correlations , and these include the linear response to external potentials .",
    "arbitrary renormalization group schemes break the @xmath12 invariance of the action and this generally complicates the attempt to obtain the temperature and/or frequency dependence of physical quantities such as the conductivity and specific heat .",
    "quantum hall physics is in many ways a unique laboratory for investigating and exploring the various different consequences of @xmath12 invariance .",
    "for example , one of the longstanding questions in the field is whether and how the theory _ dynamically _ generates the _ exact _ quantization of the hall conductance .",
    "important progress has been made recently by demonstrating that the instanton vacuum , on the strong coupling side of the problem , generally displays massless excitations at the edge of the system .",
    "@xcite these massless edge excitations are identical to those described by the more familiar theory of chiral edge bosons .",
    "@xcite our theory of massless edge excitations implies that the concept of @xmath12 invariance retains its fundamental significance all the way down to the regime of strong coupling .",
    "in this paper we put the concept of @xmath12 invariance at work and evaluate the renormalization behavior of the finkelstein theory at a two loop level .",
    "as shown in our previous papers , @xcite the technique of dimensional regularization is a unique procedure , not only for the computation of critical indices , but also for extracting the dynamical scaling functions .",
    "in fact , the metal - insulator transition in @xmath0 spatial dimensions is the only place in the theory where the temperature and/or frequency dependence of physical observables can be obtained explicitly .",
    "this motivates us to further investigate the problem in @xmath14 dimensions and use it as a stage setting for the much more complex problem of the quantum hall plateau transitions .",
    "the final results of this paper are remarkably similar to those of the more familiar classical heisenberg ferromagnet.@xcite for example , unlike the free electron gas , the coulomb interaction problem displays a conventional phase transition ( metal - insulator transition ) in @xmath0 dimensions with an ordinary order parameter .",
    "the theory is therefore quite different from that of free electrons which has a different dimensionality and displays , as is well known , anomalous or multifractal density fluctuations near criticality.@xcite    it is important to bear in mind , however , that the analogy with the heisenberg model is rather formal and it fails on many other fronts . for example , the classification of critical operators is very different from what one is used to , in ordinary sigma models .",
    "moreover , the feynman diagrams of the finkelstein theory are more complex , involving internal frequency sums which indicate that the theory effectively exists in @xmath15 space - time dimensions , rather than in two spatial dimensions alone . the complexity of @xmath12 invariant systems is furthermore illustrated by the lack of such principles like griffith analyticity that facilitates a discussion of the symmetric phase in conventional sigma models.@xcite in a subsequent paper we shall address the strong coupling insulating phase of the electron gas and show that the dynamics is distinctly different from that of the goldstone ( metallic ) phase and controlled by different operators in the theory.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after introducing the formalism ( section ii ) we embark on the details of the two loop contributions to the conductivity in section iii . as in our earlier work",
    ", we employ an @xmath16-invariance - breaking parameter @xmath17 to regularize the infinite sums over frequency .",
    "this methodology actually provides numerous self consistency checks and a major part of the computation consists of finding the ways in which the various singular contributions in @xmath17 cancel each other .",
    "the actual computation of the diagrams is described in the appendices which contain the list of the momentum and frequency integrals that are used in the text . in tables",
    "i and ii we summarize how the different singular contributions in @xmath17 cancel each other .",

    "in section iv we summarize the consequences for scaling .",
    "we extend the discussion to include the plateau transitions in the quantum hall regime in section ivc .",
    "we briefly address several new advancements , both from theoretical and experimental sides , that seem to have general consequences for the quantum theory of conductances .",
    "finally , we show how the results of this paper can be used in the problem of critical exponents @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we end this paper with a conclusion ( section v ) .",

    "the concept of _ block models _ complicates such aspects like _ particle - hole symmetry _ that is displayed by the physical observables of the electron gas .",

    "it is clear that the theory of block models is particularly sensitive with regard to the many controversial issues that presently span the subject of mesoscopic fluctuations.@xcite it is important to keep in mind that the quantum hall plateau transitions take place in precisely the regime ( @xmath232 ) where not only the conductance fluctuation are uncontrolled , but also the infinite set of higher dimensional operators that enters in the definition of the higher order momenta of the distribution functions . obviously",
