    "the nature of interaction responsible for superconductivity in @xmath1 @xcite suggests a gradual decrease in the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath14 , upon addition of impurities @xcite with increasing _",

    "is expected to fill up the @xmath20 holes in @xmath1 , which are coupled strongly to the in - plane bond - stretching mode of @xmath21 , and thereby reduce the strength of the electron - phonon coupling resulting in a decrease in @xmath14 . the observed variation in @xmath14 of alloys of @xmath6 with @xmath1 and its understanding in terms of a gradual filling up of @xmath20 holes provides a good example of this picture @xcite .",
    "since the _ electron / atom _ ratio increases as one goes from @xmath22 to @xmath23 based upon the above argument one expects the @xmath14 to systematically decrease as the different elements from the @xmath0 row are added to @xmath24 however , the experimentally observed changes in @xmath14 of @xmath0 transition - metal-@xmath1 alloys @xcite do not seem to follow the expected trend of a systematic decrease in @xmath14 as one goes from @xmath22 to @xmath25 for example , a @xmath26 @xmath10-doped @xmath1 @xmath27 has a @xmath14 of only @xmath28 while @xmath1 doped similarly with @xmath29 and @xmath30 show @xmath14 s of @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath33doped @xmath1 shows the highest @xmath14 @xmath34 of all the transition - metal-@xmath1 alloys investigated so far @xcite .",
    "the observed changes in @xmath14 of transition - metal - doped @xmath1 alloys , especially as one goes from @xmath35 to @xmath23 are unexpected even after making allowances for magnetic effects @xcite .    to understand the changes in the electronic structure and the superconducting properties of @xmath1 alloys upon addition of @xmath0 transition - metal impurities , we have carried out @xmath36 studies of @xmath2 @xmath3 alloys using density - functional - based methods .",
    "we have used korringa - kohn - rostoker coherent - potential approximation method @xcite in the atomic - sphere approximation ( kkr - asa cpa ) @xcite for taking into account the effects of disorder , gaspari - gyorffy formalism @xcite for calculating the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath13 , and allen - dynes equation @xcite for calculating @xmath14 in @xmath2 alloys . for understanding the variation in @xmath14 as one goes from @xmath22 to @xmath17 ,",
    "we have analyzed our results in terms of the changes in the spectral function @xcite along @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xcite and the densities of states ( dos ) , in particular , the changes in the @xmath21 @xmath37 and the transition - metal @xmath38 contributions to the total dos .",
    "the changes in the magnetic alloys are described in terms of spin - resolved densities of states and the local magnetic moments .",
    "before we describe our results , we outline some of the computational details of our calculation .",
    "the charge self - consistent electronic structure of unpolarized as well as spin - polarized @xmath2 alloys has been calculated using the kkr - asa cpa method . we have used the cpa successfully to describe the electronic structure of @xmath39doped @xmath1 alloys @xcite .",
    "we parametrized the exchange - correlation potential as suggested by perdew - wang within the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration was carried out using @xmath40 * k*-points in the irreducible part of the bz . for dos calculations",
    ", we added a small imaginary component of @xmath41 @xmath42 to the energy and used @xmath43 * k*-points in the irreducible part of the bz .",
    "the lattice constants for @xmath2 were fixed at the @xmath1 values .",
    "the wigner - seitz radius for @xmath44 was slightly larger than that of @xmath21 , while the wigner - seitz radii of the impurities were equal to their bulk value as given in ref .",
    "the maximum @xmath45 used was @xmath46 = @xmath47 .",
    "as indicated above , the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath13 was calculated using gaspari - gyorffy formalism with the charge self - consistent potentials of unpolarized @xmath2 alloys obtained with the kkr - asa cpa method .",
    "subsequently , the variation of @xmath14 was calculated using allen - dynes equation .",
    "the average value of phonon frequency@xmath48 for @xmath1 was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath49 .",
    "in this section we present the results of our self - consistent electronic structure calculations for @xmath2 alloys .",
    "we first describe the results of the _ unpolarized _ calculations in terms of the total and the sub - lattice resolved dos , including the local dos due to the @xmath0 transition - metal impurity . from our _ spin - polarized _ calculations ,",
    "described next , we find only the alloys of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath1 to be magnetic of all the @xmath0 elements .",
    "these results are discussed using the spin - resolved dos and the local moments .",
    "finally , the calculated variation in @xmath14 for @xmath2 alloys is compared with the available experimental data , and analyzed in terms of the dos and the spectral function along @xmath18 to @xmath19 .      in fig .",
    "1 we show the calculated densities of states of @xmath2 alloys from @xmath22 to @xmath17 , including the total dos , @xmath50 and the concentration - weighted , sub - lattice resolved dos for the two inequivalent sub - lattices @xmath51 in @xmath1 . the two inequivalent sub - lattices consist of the @xmath44 and the transition - metal on one sub - lattice @xmath52 and @xmath21 on the other two sub - lattices @xmath53 . as we go from @xmath22 to @xmath17 , the increase in the _ electron / atom _",
    "ratio moves the fermi energy , @xmath54 , as well as increases the hybridization of the host @xmath5 bands with the impurity @xmath55band .",
    "the change in @xmath54 has important consequences for the superconducting properties of these alloys , as discussed later .",
    "the inward movement of the @xmath38-band as we go from @xmath22 to @xmath17 is clearly manifested in the total dos as well as the concentration - weighted dos of @xmath44 sub - lattice .",
    "however , we find that the dos at the @xmath21 sub - lattice remains largely unaffected due to the transition - metal impurity , although the movement of @xmath54 changes the @xmath21 contribution to the total dos at @xmath54 .    to be able to examine the changes in the dos of the transition - metal impurities and to show the movement of the @xmath55band as we go from @xmath22 to @xmath17 , we show in fig .",
    "2 the dos of the transition metal impurity @xmath56 on the @xmath44 sub - lattice in @xmath2 alloys .",
    "we find that the @xmath55level crosses @xmath54 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , resulting in a very high density of states at @xmath54 for these alloys . the relatively high dos for @xmath57 and @xmath58 points to the possibility of local magnetic moment formation at the impurity sites . by the time we come to @xmath17 impurity ,",
    "the @xmath55level is well inside @xmath54 and the impurity contribution to the total dos has reduced significantly .",
    "we also find that the lowering of @xmath55level with increasing @xmath55electrons is accompanied by the narrowing of the @xmath55band .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath17 impurity the width of the @xmath55band is the narrowest , indicating almost an atomic - like behavior of these @xmath55electrons .",
    "it is interesting to note that these results are qualitatively similar to our results on @xmath0 transition - metal impurities in @xmath6 @xcite      the results of our spin - polarized calculations for @xmath2 alloys are shown in figs .",
    "our calculations show that the alloys of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath1 are exchange - split , as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 where we have plotted the spin - polarized total and the concentration - weighted , sub - lattice resolved dos for @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath1 . once again , we find that the @xmath21 sub - lattice remains unaffected due to magnetic moment formation at the impurity site on the @xmath44 sub - lattice . to clearly show the changes in the majority and the minority spin dos of the @xmath44 sub - lattice due to exchange - splitting in the dos of the impurity atom , we show in fig .",
    "4 the spin - resolved total dos due to the impurity atom .",
    "as expected from the unpolarized calculations , the exchange splitting is the largest for @xmath9 and @xmath10 alloys .",
    "the exchange - splitting in the dos due to the impurity atom leads to local moment formation at these sites with @xmath9 and @xmath10 having local moments of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the local moment on @xmath8 is very small ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "note that the total dos of the impurity is dominated by the @xmath38 contribution and the local moments arise almost entirely due to the impurity @xmath38 electrons .",
    "it must be pointed out that the calculation of local moments in alloys is sensitive to the volume that one associates with the impurity atom .",
    "given the availability of electrons around @xmath44 sub - lattice in @xmath1 alloys , a judicious choice of the impurity - atom volume is essential for a reliable description of the local moments . in our calculations",
    ", we have chosen the impurity atomic volume to be equal to the observed bulk value as given in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "however , it is clear that @xmath9 and @xmath10 will show large local moments in @xmath1 .",
    "we have studied the electronic structure of @xmath2 alloys as a prelude to understanding the superconducting properties , especially the superconducting transition temperature @xmath14 , of these alloys . in fig .",
    "6 we show our calculated @xmath14 as well as the observed @xmath14 @xcite for @xmath2 alloys .",
    "the calculated variation in @xmath14 across the @xmath0 row is similar to the one observed experimentally for @xmath10 to @xmath17 in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "note that our calculated @xmath14 for @xmath1 is equal to @xmath60 , which is consistent with the results of other works @xcite with similar approximations .",
    "the total dos and the spectral function along @xmath18 to @xmath19 at @xmath54 are expected to play an important role in deciding the @xmath14 of @xmath2 alloys .",
    "thus , in the following we examine the changes in these two quantities in @xmath2 alloys as we go from @xmath22 to @xmath17 . in fig .",
    "7 we show the total dos , @xmath61 , the @xmath62 contribution to @xmath63 and the impurity @xmath38 contribution to @xmath64 at the fermi energy .",
    "our calculations show @xmath65 to have the lowest @xmath14 of all the @xmath0 alloys , which coincides with the highest @xmath61 of @xmath66 as well as the highest @xmath38 contribution to the @xmath57 of @xmath67 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath62 contribution is not enhanced resulting in the lowest @xmath14 for @xmath15 within our approach .",
    "similarly , the @xmath14 for @xmath68 is also small in comparison with other alloys .",
    "here , we like to point out that the exchange - splitting will reduce @xmath64 , leading to a smaller @xmath61 in the case of magnetic alloys . thus , within our approach , it would have led to an increase in @xmath14 .",
    "however , the inclusion of magnetism with its pair - breaking effects @xcite will further reduce the @xmath14 . the gradual increase in @xmath14 from @xmath10 to @xmath17",
    "is due to enhanced @xmath62 contribution to @xmath63 as well as a substantial decrease in the impurity @xmath38 contribution to @xmath64 as shown in fig .",
    "7 .    to further clarify the reasons for the changes in @xmath14 in @xmath2 alloys ,",
    "as we go from @xmath22 to @xmath17 , we show in fig .",
    "8(a)-(d ) the spectral function , @xmath69**k**,@xmath70 , calculated along @xmath18 to @xmath19 direction in @xmath2 alloys . for comparison",
    "we have also plotted @xmath69**k**,@xmath70 for @xmath1 in figs .",
    "8(a ) and ( d ) .",
    "as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the additional states created along @xmath18 to @xmath19 direction reduce the coupling between the hole - like cylindrical fermi sheets with the phonons which , in turn , reduces the @xmath14 . thus an alloy with @xmath69**k**,@xmath70 similar to that of @xmath1 will show a @xmath14 close to that of @xmath1 . carrying out such a comparison in fig .",
    "8 , we find that @xmath16 will have a @xmath14 close to that of @xmath1 , while @xmath71 will show the lowest @xmath14 of them all .",
    "the fact that our calculation shows @xmath15 to have a lower @xmath14 than @xmath71 is due to the relatively high impurity dos at @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , in the case of @xmath9 and @xmath10 impurity in @xmath1 , the magnetic effects will further reduce the @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these results reinforce the observation made in ref . @xcite that the way @xmath14 changes in @xmath1 upon alloying depends dramatically on the location of the added / modified * k*-resolved states on the fermi surface .",
    "we have studied the electronic structure of @xmath0 transition - metal-@xmath1 alloys using _ _ _ _ korringa - kohn - rostoker coherent - potential approximation method in the atomic - sphere approximation .",
    "our results for the _ unpolarized _ calculations are similar to that of @xmath0 impurities in other @xmath4 and @xmath5 metals . from",
    "_ spin - polarized _ calculations we find that only alloys of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath1 are magnetic , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 having the largest local magnetic moment of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "we have used the _ unpolarized _ , self - consistent potentials of @xmath2 alloys , obtained within the coherent - potential approximation , to calculate the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath13 using the gaspari - georffy formalism .",
