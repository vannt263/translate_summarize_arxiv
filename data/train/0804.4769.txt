    "the fringes of an interferometer are sensitive to differential phases of the arms caused by unequal fields along the interfering paths .",
    "this makes interferometers useful for metrology and fundamental studies .",
    "in particular , atom interferometers offer , because of the internal structure of the atom , richer interactions , greater and simpler control than the ones based on light , electrons or neutrons @xcite . they are used for the precise determination of frequencies and times in atomic clocks , as well as many other applications to measure with unprecedented accuracy the gravity field @xcite and gravity gradients @xcite , rotations @xcite , fundamental constants @xcite , accelerations @xcite , or relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "indeed , the accuracy level is currently so high that the theoretical treatments of the global performance of the interferometer @xcite or the individual constituents ( beam splitters , mirrors ) @xcite need to be refined with respect to the simple , original modelings .",
    "a further reason is the use of ultracold atoms @xcite to minimize velocity broadening and to increase coherence lengths and flight times ; they also make possible the spatial separation of the arms by atomic recoil @xcite , as in sagnac interferometry , where slower atoms increase arm separation , the area enclosed , and thus the sensitivity achieved .",
    "in addition , the use of condensates and other ultracold - matter phases ( such as the tonks - girardeau gas ) in internal - state interferometry is currently being explored @xcite . since the atomic velocities may be nowadays several orders of magnitude smaller than in early beam experiments @xcite ,",
    "these developments raise the following question : is there any fundamental or practical lower bound for the velocities in interferometry ?",
    "@xcite . to answer it we need to go beyond the approximation in which the center of mass motion along the interferometer arms is treated classically .     pulse configuration .",
    "the left edges of the three pulses are located at @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the beams are not drawn to scale and their width is greatly exaggerated.,height=132 ]    much work on that line by bord and coworkers has emphasized a wave packet approach @xcite .",
    "we shall explore here a complementary stationary method , extending some previous results on recurrence relations which were applied to ramsey interferometry in a waveguide @xcite .",
    "the analysis of stationary solutions leads to useful insight , and quite frequently provides sufficient information , as the history of scattering theory demonstrates ( consider , e.g. , the cavalier but straightforward derivation of cross sections from stationary waves versus the more rigorous and cumbersome , but finally equivalent , wave packet derivation ) . of course , wave packets can be constructed afterwards by linear superposition for examining transients and specific space - time processes . among the interferometers with spatially",
    "separated paths we shall focus on the simplest configuration , a mach - zehnder interferometer , first implemented in the time domain by kasevich and chu @xcite .",
    "we shall deal here with the version in which the laser beams are separated in space @xcite .",
    "it consists on a first @xmath2 laser beam acting as an atom - beam splitter , followed by a mirror ( @xmath6 beam ) and finally a second , recombining @xmath2 beam , see fig .",
    "[ chu_setup_fig ] .",
    "our main tool in this investigation is the implementation of exact relations for the final transmission amplitude in the excited state .",
    "they may be cast as `` recurrence relations '' in terms of the scattering amplitudes for each laser field @xcite , which allows us to classify and calculate all possible paths by the number of reflections :- direction .",
    "do not confuse this with the recoil taking place at the second ( mirror ) laser , in which the excited or ground state are interchanged but the momentum component in @xmath7-direction does not change sign . ] the dominant or `` direct '' ones ( without reflections ) , associated with the usual semiclassical ordering of events but affected by quantum corrections , and also those paths in which the particle is reflected in several field regions .",
    "the extreme low - velocity regime in which these later `` multiple scattering '' paths become significant distorts severely the interference pattern and thus sets a fundamental lower limit to the atomic velocities for interferometry with fields separated in the space domain @xcite ; for intermediate velocities , just above the multiple scattering regime , direct paths dominate , but the semiclassical expressions are not yet quite accurate and need correction .",
    "therefore , an understanding of the various effects and scales involved is useful . to simplify the analysis and isolate quantum motion effects from other phenomena we shall ignore in this paper any external fields different from the laser fields .",
    "other simplifying assumptions are the consideration of flat and sharp ( square ) laser sheets , fully coherent processes ( i.e. , we neglect excited state relaxation ) , and semiclassical atom - laser interaction .",
    "some of these approximations are discussed in the final section .",
    "we consider a setup where a two - level atom , with an internal ( hyperfine ) transition frequency @xmath8 between levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 , moves with an initial wavenumber @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and is illuminated in three @xmath7-localized regions by a classical electric field @xmath13 traveling in @xmath14-direction , see fig .",

    "if this separation is larger than the transversal position spread of the packet @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and the detector s resolution is better than @xmath55 , the interference between the outer paths will be suppressed and only the interference between @xmath56 and @xmath57 will be observed , see fig .",

    "remark 1 : unlike the ramsey configuration , this pattern is independent of @xmath62 and thus of the intermediate distance @xmath63 between the pulses since both interfering paths spend the same amount of time in the upper level and there is no accumulation of a phase difference .",
    "remark 2 : @xmath64 so that there is a minimum ( zero ) at @xmath65 independently of all other parameters . in particular ,",
    "this is true ( within this approximation ) regardless of the velocity and the precision with which the @xmath2 and @xmath6 pulses are implemented .",
