    "continuous self - similarity ( css ) , or homothety , in a spacetime expresses the absence of a preferred length or timescale . as a continuous symmetry , it reduces the number of coordinates on which the metric depends by one . in combination with",
    "spherical symmetry , it therefore reduces the einstein equations to a system of ordinary differential equations , and this is one reason why spacetimes with these combined symmetries have been studied extensively .",
    "besides simplicity , a general reason for studying solutions with symmetries in physics is that attractors of the time evolution flow in phase space usually have more symmetries than generic solutions .",
    "for example , in general relativity the end state of gravitational collapse is a kerr - newman black hole , which is stationary and axisymmetric .    from a physical point of view , spherically symmetric css solutions were studied , among other reasons , because they give rise to naked singularities from regular initial states @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the formation of a naked singularity is always associated with self - similar collapse @xcite .",
    "these singularities did not seem , however , to be attractors of the evolution flow ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "then choptuik @xcite found a self - similar solution acting as an _ intermediate attractor _ in gravitational collapse close to the black hole formation threshold .",
    "the effects seen by choptuik with scalar field matter were confirmed by abrahams and evans @xcite in the collapse of axisymmetric gravitational waves and by evans and coleman @xcite in spherical fluid collapse with the scale - free equation of state @xmath0 . for",
    "a review see @xcite .    in all these cases",
    "the intermediate attractor , or critical solution , is self - similar and contains a naked singularity .",
    "the fluid critical solution is css , but the scalar field critical solution and the gravitational wave critical solution display a discrete self - similarity ( dss ) .",
    "such a symmetry had not previously been considered in general relativity ( but see @xcite for dss in other sciences ) .",
    "css spherical perfect fluid solutions were generated numerically by ori and piran @xcite .",
    "a family of css spherical scalar field solutions was obtained in closed form by roberts @xcite .",
    "all such solutions were later classified by brady @xcite .",
    "a semi - kinematical classification of css spherical null dust spacetimes was carried out by nolan @xcite .    here , we review the purely kinematical consequences ( that is , not using the einstein equations ) of self - similarity combined with spherical symmetry .",
    "our methods are generalizations of those in @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper have already been applied to a classification of all css spherical perfect fluid solutions @xcite , and to the scalar field critical solution , which is dss @xcite .",
    "to put our results for spherical spacetimes into a wider context , we first discuss self - similarity without assuming any other symmetry .",
    "in particular , we do not yet restrict to spherical symmetry .",
    "a spacetime is continuously self - similar ( css ) , or homothetic , if there is a vector field @xmath1 such that @xmath2 the value @xmath3 on the right - hand side is a convention that normalizes @xmath4 , but it must be constant . any additional structure that covariantly defines an orientable vector field ( for example , the 4-velocity vector of a fluid ) allows to generalize the concept of continuous self - similarity beyond homothety @xcite , but we will not consider such generalizations here .    in a css solution",
    "the integral curves of the homothetic vector field ( css lines ) are geometric objects , and hence provide a geometrically preferred fibration of the spacetime .",
    "we choose coordinates such that they are lines of constant coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the metric can then be written in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and where @xmath9 depends on the @xmath5 but not on @xmath10 .",
    "a spacetime is discretely self - similar ( dss ) if there is a conformal isometry @xmath11 of the spacetime such that @xmath12 @xmath13 , the dimensionless scale period , is made unique by taking it to be the smallest positive value for which ( [ dssgeometric ] ) holds .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is then a geometric property of the spacetime .",
    "the metric of a dss spacetime can also be written in the form ( [ generaldss ] ) , where @xmath9 is now allowed to depend periodically on @xmath10 with period @xmath13 .",
    "the form ( [ generaldss ] ) of the dss metric is preserved under coordinates changes of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are periodic in @xmath10 with period @xmath13 . in analogy with css lines we call the lines of constant @xmath5 dss lines , but unlike the css lines they are not unique .",
    "the non - uniqueness is parameterized by ( [ dssxtransform ] ) .",
    "a closely related type of coordinate system frequently used for css or dss spacetimes is obtained when one replaces @xmath10 by @xmath17 .",
    "( the two minus signs are merely a matter of convention .",
    "note that @xmath18 is not necessarily a time coordinate . )",
    "the metric becomes @xmath19 where the metric coefficients @xmath9 are the same as in ( [ generaldss ] ) .",
    "if one also replaces the @xmath5 by @xmath20 , the metric becomes @xmath21 note that all coordinates can be spacelike , null , or timelike , as we have not made any assumptions about the sign of the metric coefficients .",
    "note also that in coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath22 the metric coefficients @xmath23 still depend only on @xmath24 in the css case , and in the dss case also periodically on @xmath25 .",
    "it is natural to think of the coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath10 as dimensionless , and of @xmath18 and @xmath22 as having dimension length . in this case one",
    "should define @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a fixed arbitrary length scale , and similarly in other expressions . in the following",
    "we do not write @xmath27 for simplicity .",
    "the decomposition ( [ generaldss ] ) of the metric suggests that we classify elements of the spacetime as `` kinematical '' or `` dynamical '' depending on whether they are generated by the conformal factor @xmath28 or the structure of @xmath29 .",
    "some of the effects of the conformal factor can be understood by dimensional analysis .",
    "for example , the kretschmann scalar @xmath30 , which has dimension ( length)@xmath31 , scales as @xmath32 along css or dss lines : @xmath33 where @xmath34 depends on @xmath35 , and in dss also periodically on @xmath10 .",
    "( @xmath34 is not the kretschmann scalar of @xmath29 . )",
    "all other curvature scalars scale similarly , according to their dimension .",
    "therefore @xmath36 , for any @xmath5 , is _ generically _ a scalar curvature singularity of any self - similar spacetime .",
    "we call it the `` kinematical singularity '' .",
    "however , @xmath37 or @xmath38 can occur on an isolated css or dss line , say @xmath39 , and in this case the simultaneous limit @xmath40 , @xmath41 may depend on the curve @xmath42 on which the limit is reached . furthermore , dimensional analysis may be misleading for frame components of the curvature .",
    "an example of this in spherical symmetry is described below ( a fan with @xmath43 ) , where a frame component blows up at @xmath44 .",
    "because the natural dimension for an affine parameter is length , dimensional analysis suggests that the affine parameter scales as @xmath45 , so that dss lines are finite as @xmath46 , but infinitely extended as @xmath47 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath44 generically corresponds to infinite area radius @xmath48 .",
    "we therefore call @xmath44 the `` kinematical infinity '' . however , lake and zannias @xcite show that it is possible to have complete null css lines .",
    "we have found an example of this in spherical symmetry ( a fan with @xmath49 ) , where the affine parameter is @xmath10 , rather than @xmath45 .",
    "as we assume that the spacetime is _ globally _ fibrated by css or dss lines , its global manifold structure must be the product of a 3-manifold ( with coordinates @xmath5 ) and the @xmath10 line , the cylinder @xmath50 .",
    "note that the geometry need not correspond to the manifold structure .",
    "the kinematical singularity , for example , can be a single point , a line , a 2-dimensional surface or a 3-dimensional surface .",
    "in addition to the kinematical singularity and infinity , singularities and infinities can also be generated by the structure of @xmath51 .",
    "we shall call these `` dynamical '' . if we define a singularity as an obstruction to continuing the spacetime , and consider only inextendible spacetimes , by definition the boundaries of the spacetime are either singularities or infinities .",
    "the kinematical boundaries @xmath52 are copies of @xmath53 .",
    "the dynamical boundaries of the spacetime must be invariant under the self - similarity , and so the dynamical boundary has the manifold structure @xmath54 .",
    "a hypersurface that is invariant under the self - similarity can in general be deformed continuously into another such hypersurface .",
    "on the other hand , this is generically not true for an invariant _ null _ hypersurface .",
    "such a hypersurface is therefore a geometrical object and is called a self - similarity horizon ( ssh ) .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we restrict our discussion to spherical symmetry . the four - dimensional spacetime is the product of a two - dimensional spacetime with coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath35 ( the reduced spacetime ) and a round two - sphere of area @xmath55 .",
    "we write the most general metric adapted to spherical symmetry in the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the metric on the unit 2-sphere , and where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are functions of @xmath10 and @xmath35 .",
    "the explicit factor @xmath28 has been written in anticipation of self - similarity . in the following we assume that the signature is @xmath62 , and that the metric is non - degenerate except possibly at the boundaries , so that @xmath63 .",

    "the area radius @xmath69 is a scalar in the reduced manifold .",
    "a second geometrical scalar is the hawking mass @xmath70 defined by @xmath71 . from @xmath70 and @xmath48 we can define the dimensionless scalar @xmath72 . a spherical surface ( point in the reduced spacetime ) where @xmath73 is a closed trapped surface , and one where @xmath74 is an apparent horizon .",
    "we now restrict to self - similarity , discussing the continuous and discrete symmetries separately .",
    "the metric ( [ spherical_metric ] ) is css with homothetic vector @xmath75 if and only if @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 depend only on @xmath35 .",
    "( the same then holds for @xmath76 . )",

    "all coordinate systems with this property are related by coordinate transformations of the form @xmath77 the first of these just relabels the css lines .",
    "this is similar to a change of radial coordinate in a coordinate system for schwarzschild ( for example from the area radius to the isotropic radial coordinate ) .",
    "the second changes the @xmath10 slicing , and can be used to turn @xmath10 into a global coordinate .",
    "this is similar to a change of slicing in schwarzschild , for example from the schwarzschild to the painlev - gllstrand time .",

    "dss lines can be moved around by a coordinate transformation ( as well as relabeled ) .",
    "it is clear that we can not transform a dss line with @xmath80 for all @xmath10 into one with @xmath78 , or vice versa .",
    "if the sign of @xmath58 changes with @xmath10 along a dss line , the line can be moved ( `` straightened out '' ) until @xmath58 is either strictly positive , strictly negative or zero for all @xmath10 . in the following",
    "we always assume that the spacetime is covered by one global coordinate patch with this property .",
    "this can always be done , although for numerical calculations it may be better to use local patches in which the metric can be simplified .",
    "in such a coordinate system , the sign of @xmath58 is a geometric property of a region of spacetime just as in css .",
    "this restriction does not make the dss lines with @xmath80 or @xmath78 rigid , because these are just inequalities , but it does make the @xmath79 lines rigid : we can not deform such a line without making parts of it spacelike or timelike .",
    "@xmath79 lines are radial null geodesics that are invariant under the self - similarity . in the full spacetime",
    "they correspond to spherical self - similarity horizons .",
    "in the following , we shall focus on isolated sshs .",
    "when the ssh is not isolated , @xmath58 need not vanish there .",
    "an example is given in sec .",
    "[ section : blocks ] .",
    "dss lines and lines of constant @xmath10 are normal to each other if and only if @xmath88 . the geometric interpretation of the sign of @xmath59 is more complicated , and will be deferred to sec .",

    "the 4-dimensional spacetime is fibrated by css lines or dss lines , and so the _ reduced _ spacetime is _ foliated _ by css or dss lines , all extending from @xmath44 to @xmath36 .",
    "the manifold structure of the reduced spacetime is therefore a rectangle , the @xmath10 line times an interval in @xmath35 . in the dss case , we make the assumption that both dynamical boundaries , as well as any sshs , are dss lines @xmath89 .",
    "these are only local restrictions on the coordinate system .",
    "we then have two kinematical boundaries @xmath52 and two dynamic boundaries @xmath90 .",
    "there are three types of dynamical boundary :    a dynamical infinity is a dynamical boundary where radial geodesics reach infinite affine parameter with finite @xmath10 .",
    "most naturally this coincides with @xmath91 , but finite @xmath61 is also conceivable , corresponding to a wormhole with topology @xmath92 that stretches to infinity in the @xmath35-direction with finite circumferences @xmath93 .",
    "a dynamical singularity is a dynamical boundary where radial null geodesics end in infinite curvature at finite affine parameter , at finite @xmath10 .",
    "a dynamical singularity can be central , with @xmath94 , or conceivably be non - central , with @xmath95 . as mentioned in the discussion of the general ( non - spherical case ) , any weak singularities through which the spacetime can be continued",
    "would be considered interior points .",
    "a regular center is given by @xmath94 with the additional condition @xmath96 as @xmath97 .",

    "@xmath99 or @xmath38 always corresponds to one of these three boundaries , and so can not occur except at the dynamical boundaries .",
    "therefore , as @xmath100 , the kinematical boundary @xmath36 is always central and the kinematical boundary @xmath44 always has infinite area .",

    "a foliation by dss lines is not unique , but it can be restricted enough to serve essentially the same purpose .",
    "this , combined with dimensional analysis , suggested a heuristic classification of the boundaries of the reduced spacetime into a kinematical infinity @xmath44 where all dss lines begin , a kinematical singularity @xmath36 where they end , and two dynamical boundaries @xmath256 and @xmath257 which _ are _ dss lines . each of the two dynamical boundaries can be either a regular center , a singularity , or an infinity .",

    "this would rule out spacetimes with two or more disjoint singularities , for example cosmologies with a big bang and big crunch , or two or more infinities , for example kruskal - like spacetimes @xcite .",

    "we investigated and classified a fairly generic family of sshs by approximating them by a class of spacetimes we call the q - metric .",
    "we showed that these sshs are not simply lines in the interior of the conformal diagram , but are t - shaped , with the crossbar of the t forming part of the either the kinematical infinity ( fan ) or kinematical singularity ( splash ) .",
    "a neighbourhood of the ssh is therefore a triangle in the conformal diagram .",
    "the entire conformal diagram of a generic spherical dss spacetime can be assembled from these extended sshs .",
    "we have attempted a general classification , but our analysis is not rigorous , and we may have overlooked some kinematical possibilities .",
    "at least our framework fits all spherical dss solutions known to us including some degenerate cases .",
    "a problem arises in the q - metric with @xmath43 , where a part of what by dimensional analysis should be the kinematical infinity is in fact a non - scalar curvature singularity .",
