    "the subject of strong localization of electronic states was pioneered by early efforts of p. w. anderson ( 1958)@xcite , revealing the existence of a phase transition from a metallic phase to an insulating phase and established a remarkable set of criteria or bounds on the transition in terms of the relative disorder strength . in one - dimension ( 1d )",
    ", it can be rigorously shown that there is a strict absence of extended states for an arbitrarily finite amount of disorder .",
    "this was first stated by mott and twose ( 1961 ) in a heuristic manner@xcite and later made more rigorous by others@xcite",
    ". however , the validity of this result only encompasses models with uncorrelated disorder and nearest - neighbor hopping terms .",
    "recent efforts have studied particular classes of hamiltonians containing long - ranged interactions that exhibit delocalization criticality in lower dimensions@xcite .",
    "the power - law random - banded matrix ( prbm ) ensemble , introduced by mirlin @xmath3@xcite is a large @xmath4 random matrix whose entries @xmath5 decrease in a power - law fashion @xmath6 , with a random hopping coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "mapping the problem onto a nonlinear @xmath8-model with a non - local interaction , they found a transition from localized to extended states at @xmath9 .",
    "levitov , using a renormalization group approach studied a similar system with disordered site energies and non - random hopping , also found that for @xmath2 , all states are localized@xcite , with @xmath9 as the critical value .    in this article , we adopt a perturbative approach that is similar in spirit to the original arguments of anderson , in that a breakdown of perturbation theory in the weak disorder limit indicates that the ground state of the disordered system is very different from the ideal crystal and the two ground - states can not be approached by adiabatically turning the disorder strength on or off .",
    "we modify a scaling argument originally discussed in the reference@xcite for short - ranged systems .",
    "we consider the weak disorder regime and the convergence criteria that determine whether the disorder is allowed to be a weak perturbative effect in the thermodynamic limit is approached but not taken explicitly .",
    "if this criterion is rendered false as @xmath10 increases then all of the eigenstates are localized .",
    "we also provide an estimate of the scaling behavior of localization length as function of the disorder strength in the regime where the disorder is moderately strong and nonperturbative .",
    "consider the tight - binding model with one orbital per site , for @xmath10 sites with lattice spacing @xmath11 , that is governed by the following schr@xmath12dinger equation , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the electron amplitudes at integer site values @xmath15 and the summation is taken over all unique pairs of lattice sites @xmath16 .",
    "the effective width of the spectrum @xmath17 has the power law spatial dependence , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant that depends on the details of the atomic orbital overlap matrix elements and the hopping exponent is a positive integer @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that for translationally invariant systems with periodic boundary conditions we can make use of the bloch theorem , yielding a solution to eq.([eq : motionideal ] ) of the form @xmath21 where we have introduced the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath22 , in terms of the wave vector @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "next , by substituting eqs.([eq : hopping ] ) and ( [ eq : bloch ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : motionideal ] ) , we have the following expression for the band dispersion : @xmath25 for a mean site energy value , @xmath26 .",
    "eq.([disp1 ] ) can be evaluated explicitly in terms of polylogarithms as shown in the reference@xcite . using the definition : @xmath27 we arrive at a more compact expression , @xmath28 + li_{\\alpha}[e^ { -i { \\bf k } } ] )    \\label{eq : dispideal}\\ ] ] it important to note that the fundamental limitation of this approach is that one can not apply the identity ( [ eq : polylog ] ) in the case fractional values of @xmath29",
    ". therefore , for the entirety of this paper we only consider integer values of @xmath29 and we concede that a critical value alpha might be a non - integer value however , we can estimate ranges rounded to the nearest integer .    for specific cases of",
    "@xmath29 one can make use of the following exactly summable series@xcite ,    @xmath30    this results in the following dispersion relations :    @xmath31",
    "having established the dispersion relations for the ideal system , let us now turn our attention the disordered system , where the site energies take random values from an uncorrelated gaussian distribution .",
    "we shall follow precisely , the formalism and notation of f. dominguez - adame and v.a .",
    "malyshev in the reference@xcite .",
    "the equations of motion result from the following modification to eq.([eq : motionideal ] ) ,    @xmath32    where we have defined @xmath33 as the random deviation of the site energies from the mean @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath34 is a random variable , distributed according to a standard white - noise , gaussian distribution : @xmath35 that is centered at zero @xmath36 , with a standard deviation @xmath8 .",
    "the scaling procedure requires two major components .",
    "first we must determine the energy level spacing of unperturbed , ideal system , which is dominated by the long wavelength behavior of the dispersion relation , @xmath37 , that we term @xmath38 .",
    "this quantity solely depends on the mathematical form of the dispersion relations , which ultimately depend on the range of the interactions .",
    "second , we must compute the statistical fluctuations of the disorder - induced energy shifts at the first order in perturbation theory , while assuming that any divergence will occur at the lowest order .",
    "we begin by determining the fluctuations of the first order energy shifts .",
    "we will examine the diagonal and off - diagonal contributions separately . since the site energies still reside on an underlying lattice we can transform eq.([eq : dismotion ] ) to the k - representation by multiplying both sides by ( [ eq : bloch ] ) and summing over the site numbers , @xmath15 : @xmath39 where we have defined the following ,    @xmath40    notice that @xmath41 are simply the matrix elements , of the random potential , or site energies in the unperturbed basis .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath42 represent a first order perturbative energy shift of the @xmath43 state , @xmath44 which solely depends on the particular quenched realization of the disorder .",
    "the square - root fluctuations are given by , @xmath45 evidently , the diagonal contributions result in an inhomogeneous broadening of the quasi - particle energy level , for given ensemble of quenched disorder .",
    "the bloch states of the ideal system satisfy the perturbative condition , increasing faster with increasing @xmath10 than the critical separatrix .",
    ", height=240 ]    on the other hand , the off - diagonal components are generally associated with overlapping , or inter - site scattering of the quasi - particle states .",
    "thus , playing an important role in localization . by utilizing eq.([eq : defv ] ) , one can see that @xmath46 in addition , this represents the typical fluctuation , for a given lattice size .",
    "notice that these fluctuations vanish in the limit of a large system size @xmath47 .",
    "this effect is known as  self - averaging \" or  exchange - narrowing \" .",
    "most importantly , our test for localization is the perturbative condition below : @xmath48 the left hand side of side of eq.([eq : condition ] ) has the following scale dependence for a given value of @xmath29 , @xmath49 let us now examine the energy level spacings and if they satisfy the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) , for increasing system size @xmath10 ,    @xmath50    apparently , for @xmath9 the perturbative condition is satisfied with increasing @xmath10 , therefore the mixing of the bloch states is weak enough such that the quasi - particle states are expected to remain extended over the entire system length .",
    "however , for @xmath51 the disorder has a nonperturbative effect and the perturbative condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) is violated such that the bloch states are strongly mixed and the quantity @xmath52 decreases slower than @xmath53 and @xmath54 signifying that the disordered eigenfunctions can not be perturbed from the extended bloch states and thus , all of the eigenstates are localized .",
    "a useful illustration is shown in fig.[fig : pert ] , where the scale dependence of the energy level spacings for each @xmath29 case is plotted on a logarithmic scale . clearly , as the range of the interactions is decreased with increasing @xmath29 , the eigenstates are more strongly localized .",
    "the threshold at which the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) fails indicates the onset of localization , where localization length is smaller than the size of the lattice .",
    "this clearly occurs in the non - perturbative regime , where strength of the disorder is strong but finite and intermediate between the weak and strong disorder regimes .",
    "therefore , one can estimate how the localization length scales as a function of the ratio @xmath55 , by solving for @xmath56 in the equation below , @xmath57 the solution to eq.([eq : condition2 ] ) , can be understood graphically in fig.[fig : pert ] as the intersection of each of the @xmath58 curves with the separatrix .    for the @xmath59 case ,",
    "the localization length solves the equation below , @xmath60 \\label{eq : exp}\\ ] ] it follows that for sufficiently weak disorder , the ratio @xmath61 , therefore eq.([eq : exp ] ) reduces to the cubic equation , @xmath62 which , admits nonreal , complex solutions and as expected the localization length should not scale with @xmath63 given that all the states are extended . on the other hand , in the opposite limit , @xmath64 , the solution involves an essential singularity , also admitting complex solutions , therefore the proper scaling of the localization occurs in the highly nonperturbative regime , where our eq.([eq : exp ] ) must be determined numerically .",
    "this breakdown of the localization length scaling in both asymptotic limits suggests there is a phase transition connecting the strong and weak disorder regimes .",
    "next for the strictly localized cases @xmath65 , for shorter ranged hopping , the scaling of the localization length becomes , @xmath66 as expected when @xmath67 , which is more abrupt on the scale of the lattice , one recovers the scaling exponent of @xmath68 which is consistent with numerical simulations of disordered 1d chains@xcite with nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "it should be noted that the numerical prefactors depend on the specifics of the model and the proper choice of boundary conditions .",
    "lastly , we mention that the methods outlined in the paper can also be generalized to incorporate correlated disorder , for instance , with power law decay . instead of a white noise distribution of the random site energies , consider a scenario where the power spectrum of the noise has @xmath69 , recently discussed as possibly occurring in conducting dna wires and in conducting 1d systems@xcite . evidently , the autocorrelation function of the matrix elements of @xmath70 as designated by eq.([eq : defv ] ) would not scale as @xmath71 , rather the fluctuations of the disorder would decrease faster , depending on the value of @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that for longer ranged correlated site energies , the eigenstates can more easily satisfy the perturbative condition given by eq.([eq : condition ] ) , and thus longer ranged correlations correspond to weaker localization , ultimately allowing for critical delocalization at some particular value of @xmath72 .    to conclude we have demonstrated a more physically transparent approach without the use of non - linear @xmath8 models or renormalization group methods for analyzing the localization criteria for disordered tight - binding hamiltonians with power - law hopping . to construct our perturbative approach we relied upon exactly summable series for the integer values of the hopping exponent @xmath29 , allowing for a precise determination of the unperturbed dispersion relations .",
    "then we utilized a simple scaling inequality , which compares the fluctuations of the disorder to the energy level spacings of the unperturbed system .",
    "we have found that for @xmath59 , there are extended states and the perturbative condition holds for sufficiently weak disorder ."
