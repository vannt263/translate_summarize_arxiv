    "the co - evolution of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) and their host galaxies , suggested to explain the tight correlations between bh mass ( @xmath4 ) and host - galaxy properties , such as the @xmath4-stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath4-bulge luminosity ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath4-bulge mass ( @xmath15 ) relations discovered in the local universe ( see also recent studies by ) can be considered a key element in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . in theoretical models ,",
    "agn feedback has been considered as a promising physical driver for these correlations .",
    "another possibility is statistical convergence from hierarchical merging that reproduces the observed correlations without the need of a physical coupling .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the scaling relations can also be achieved in the galaxy - scale torque - limited bh accretion model as an alternative to self - regulated bh growth models driven by agn feedback .    however , given the assumptions and approximations involved in the theoretical models which lead to degeneracies of the underlying parameters , the origin of the bh mass - host galaxy coupling is still an open question .",
    "observations , on the other hand , can provide direct constraints on how bhs and galaxies co - evolve by probing the scaling relations over cosmic time . such an empirical evidence is essential to determine the underlying fundamental physical processes at work and to guide the models of galaxy formation and evolution .    to measure bh masses in the distant universe , observational studies have to rely on galaxies with actively accreting bhs ( also known as active galactic nuclei = agns ) and in particular broad - line ( type i ) agns to apply the virial method .",
    "the majority of these studies have found an evolution in which the bh growth precedes the growth of the host - galaxy bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , some studies are consistent with no evolution , and others even report an opposite trend , i.e. , under - massive bhs given their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the great amount of effort put towards determining the evolution of the bh mass scaling relations , uncertainties remain , largely due to the inherent uncertainties in bh mass estimates using the virial method ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) together with measurement systematics in host - galaxy properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and small sample sizes and limited dynamic ranges .",
    "making use of high quality data of a large sample covering a wide dynamic range and taking into account systematic uncertainties as well as observational biases ( e.g. , , see also @xcite ) is essential to make progress in understanding the cosmic evolution of the bh mass scaling relations .",
    "following the footsteps of our previous work , the current paper represents another step towards this goal .",
    "the evolution of the bh mass scaling rations has been the main focus of our team effort .",
    "while the @xmath4 - @xmath14 relation at lookback time of 4 - 6 gyr has been probed based on the high quality keck spectra @xcite , our group made the first attempt in @xcite to study the evolution of the @xmath7  relation using a carefully selected sample of 17 active galaxies at @xmath16 , determining both bh masses and host - galaxy properties by combining high quality keck spectra and high - resolution hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images .",
    "the results revealed a significant offset of the high - redshift sample from the local @xmath7  relation corresponding to an evolution of the form @xmath17 , with selection effects being negligible .",
    "@xcite went a step further by including 23 new galaxies ( 17 at @xmath16 , six at @xmath18 ) imaged with the _ hst _  near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) .",
    "thus , the total number of objects in the sample was 40 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "furthermore , a local comparison sample of reverberation - mapped ( rm ) active galaxies measured in a consistent manner to minimize biases was used as a local baseline .",
    "an evolutionary trend of the form @xmath20 was derived , taking into account selection effects via a monte carlo approach .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath21  relation showed apparently no evolution ( at least out to a redshift of @xmath221 ) , suggestive of dominant bulge growth through secular evolution by a re - distribution of disk stars .    here , we continue these efforts by adding 12 new galaxies ( three at @xmath16 , nine at @xmath18 ) based on _ hst _   wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) images , and finalize the result on the evolution of the @xmath7  relation by updating all @xmath4  and @xmath6  measurements . to minimize possible measurement systematics",
    ", we perform a consistent analysis for the entire sample ( @xmath23 objects total ) to obtain bh masses and bulge luminosities .",
    "in addition , in contrast to our previous analysis @xcite , we improved the spectral decomposition method by taking into account host - galaxy starlight and broad iron emission contribution for a more accurate emission - line width measurement ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , the photometric decomposition now takes advantage of a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler for better optimization in the large parameter space , simultaneously allowing for linear combinations of different point - spread function ( psf ) models to account for a possible psf mismatch . including a sample of 27 objects taken from the literature and analyzed in a consistent way , our final sample consists of 79 active galaxies for which we derive the evolution of the @xmath7  relation , taking into account selection effects with a revised monte carlo technique .",

    "however , agn lifetime is likely a function of luminosity and/or mass , and not a single value for the entire population , given the diverse physical properties of the agn population .",
    "the agn lifetime can be estimated as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the duty cycle and @xmath131 is the hubble time at the given redshift .",
    "we here adopt the semi - analytic prediction for the duty cycle as a function of bh mass and redshift , @xmath132 , given in table 4 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also their figure 7 ) .",
    "this reflects agn downsizing : a higher mass and higher activity population has a shorter lifetime , thus completing its bh mass growth by accretion at an earlier epoch ( i.e. , anti - hierarchical bh growth ) . the estimated lifetimes for our sample range from @xmath133 myr to @xmath134 myr with an average of @xmath135 myr .",
    "these lifetime estimates along with the growth rates lead to bh mass growth by on average @xmath136 dex for our sample with a maximum of @xmath121 dex .",

    "interpreted in the framework of co - evolution of bhs and their host galaxies and assuming that the local relation is the final product , bhs grow first and their host galaxies need to catch up .",

    "@xmath152% show signs of ( major ) mergers / interactions  a promising way to grow the bulge .",
    "@xcite suggested that a merger with a disk - dominated system containing no bh can explain substantial growth of bulge luminosity by transferring stars in a disk to a bulge .",
    "however , this would only work for a fraction of our sample . recently ,",
    "secular evolution driven by disk instabilities and/or minor merging has also been suggested for the bulge growth mechanism by redistributing mass into the bulge component without a significant growth of bh .",
    "selection effects can mimic an evolutionary trend ( , see also ) .",
    "thus , we here consider three kinds of selection effects in the analysis .",
    "( i ) performing monte carlo simulations , we take into account the potential bias that might arise when selecting a broad - line agn sample based on their luminosities ( i.e. , bh masses ) @xcite . given the presence of intrinsic scatter of the scaling relations , particularly in the high - luminosity regime where the galaxy ( and bulge ) luminosity function is steeply decreasing , this can lead to a preferential selection of higher mass bhs .",
    "\\(ii ) in the same simulations , we also take into account the selection effect introduced by the large uncertainties on bh mass measured from the se method (; but see also ) .",
    "it is more likely to detect massive bhs at a given bulge luminosity since the true lower mass bhs have a higher chance of being scatted into the higher se mass bin through the se mass estimates with large uncertainty than the intrinsically higher - mass bhs , under the steeply declining bh mass function .",
    "thus , this will lead to a positive bias . on the contrary",
    ", a negative bias may be expected from the uncertainty of the bulge luminosity  given the steeply declining galaxy luminosity function , for a given bh mass , there will be a higher chance of scattering effectively less luminous galaxies into the brighter luminosity bins .",
    "\\(iii ) lastly , we consider the active fraction selection function suggested by that can cause a negative offset in a sample of agns by preferentially observing less massive bhs for a given bulge luminosity in the presence of intrinsic scatter of the scaling relation , since the active fraction ( i.e. , the probability of bhs to be observed as active galaxies ) decreases as a function of mass .",
    "since the details of mass and redshift dependence of the active fraction is not well - known , we by - pass this bias by performing monte carlo simulations based on active bh mass function , assuming that the active fraction is independent of redshift for the redshift range covered by our sample .    aside from these selection effects",
    ", there are other limitations that need to be addressed for a better estimation of the evolution of the scaling relations .",
    "first , bh mass measurements for distant active galaxies have to rely on the empirically calibrated se method which is subject to relatively large random and systematic uncertainties ( see a review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty stems from the virial factor that depends on the unknown kinematics and geometry of the blr and is currently adopted from an empirically - calibrated average virial factor for the entire bh population ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a direct assessment of the virial factor for each active galaxy will greatly reduce the uncertainties in @xmath4  measurements ( see , e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the results from our own image decomposition might be systematically different to those from other published studies ( e.g. , using galfit ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , a thorough comparison is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "third , the sample of local rm agns is small and covers a small dynamic range .",
    "the extension of this sample and a more complete establishment of the local scaling relation will ultimately shed light on the accurate characterization of the bh - galaxy co - evolution .",
    "although the bh mass range covered in our sample and the local rm agns are almost the same , we need to extend our sample to higher and lower @xmath6  regimes for a more direct comparison to the local rm agns .",
    "extending the sample toward the low - mass regime ( @xmath153@xmath3 ) where the magnitude of selection biases is expected to be smaller is essential .    properly taking into account the selection effects ,",
    "we have derived the overall positive evolutionary trend , although the result is subject to the adopted prior for the intrinsic scatter because we can not constrain the slope and intrinsic scatter simultaneously due to the insufficient dynamic range of our sample . at this point",
    ", it is difficult to distinguish between a mean evolution of the scaling relations ( normalization ) and an evolution of their intrinsic scatter ( see also * ? ? ?",
