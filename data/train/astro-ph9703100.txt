    "the x - ray spectra of most seyfert 1 type galaxies are formed predominantly within @xmath3 schwarzschild radii of their black holes , while seyfert optical permitted lines are formed in a separate and significantly larger region .",
    "thus , it was remarkable when an extremely strong anticorrelation was found between spectral softness and h@xmath1 full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) in type 1 seyferts ( e.g. boller , brandt & fink 1996 , hereafter bbf96 ) and quasars ( e.g. laor et  al . 1994 ; laor et  al .",
    "ultrasoft narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( hereafter nls1 ; see osterbrock & pogge 1985 , goodrich 1989 and stephens 1989 ) represent one extreme of this anticorrelation and can often have photon indices , from simple power - law fits , exceeding 3 .",
    "such steep spectra appear to be due to strong soft x - ray excesses ( compared to the underlying x - ray power law ) in the band below about 1 kev .",
    "these soft x - ray excesses show rapid and large amplitude variability , supporting a compact origin .",
    "nls1 also tend to lie towards the strong fe  ii , weak [ o  iii ] extreme of the first boroson & green ( 1992 ) eigenvector , and for this reason they are sometimes called i  zw  1 objects .    comparatively little is known about the harder x - ray properties of nls1 , although ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) observations of a few ultrasoft nls1 have shown that they can have interesting spectral differences from more typical seyfert 1s .",
    "for example , pounds , done & osborne ( 1995 , hereafter pdo95 ) found a power law with a remarkably large 210 kev photon index of @xmath4 in the wide field camera nls1 re  j  1034 + 393 .",
    "they also confirmed the presence of a strong soft x - ray excess above the steep power law ( also see puchnarewicz et  al .",
    "this soft excess dominates the x - ray spectrum at energies @xmath5  kev .",
    "pdo95 drew an analogy between re  j  1034 + 393 and galactic black hole candidates accreting in their ultrasoft high states .",
    "they also suggested that its intense soft x - ray flux may be cooling its accretion disc corona to cause the anomalously steep hard x - ray spectrum ( see section 7 of maraschi & haardt 1997 ) .",
    "it is important to determine if other ultrasoft nls1 also show steep 210 kev spectra ( see pounds & brandt 1997 ) , as this could give much needed clues about the formation of the underlying continua of all seyferts .    in this letter",
    "we use the currently available data to compare the @xmath0 210 kev intrinsic power - law slopes of nls1 with soft spectra to those of seyfert 1s with larger h@xmath1 fwhm .",
    "we are interested in the _ intrinsic _ slopes ( free from effects such as compton reflection ) since these are thought to probe the fundamental nature of the underlying hard x - ray continuum .",
    "as is standard practice , we quantify spectral slopes using power - law photon indices , and power laws usually appear to be reasonable representations of the _ intrinsic _",
    "210  kev continua , at least to first order .",
    "figure 1 shows a plot of hard ( @xmath0 210 kev ) photon index versus the fwhm of the h@xmath1 line .",
    "this plot may be compared with the analogous plots made using lower - energy data shown as figure  8 of bbf96 and figure  5a of laor et  al .",
    "we have only used x - ray data to make this diagram to avoid calibration uncertainties between different satellites .",
    "we have only used data above 2  kev to avoid possible confusion by soft x - ray excesses , cold absorbers , warm absorbers and other low - energy spectral complexity .",
    "the squares in figure 1 are seyfert 1s from the large sample recently presented by nandra et  al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter n97 ) .",
    "we have used the photon indices from table 6 of n97 .",
    "these are for the 310 kev band .",
    "the effects of compton reflection have been included in the fitting , and this tends to increase the derived intrinsic photon indices by @xmath6 .",
    "appropriate modelling of the iron k@xmath7 emission line has also been performed , although the derived photon indices are not sensitive to details of the line model ( see section  4.3 of n97 ) .",
    "the 310  kev photon indices are expected to be very similar to the 210  kev photon indices ( k. nandra , private communication ) , and explicit spectral fitting of several of the n97 objects verifies that this appears to be the case .",
    "all objects in n97 are included in figure 1 except for ngc  4151 , ngc  6814 and 3c  120 .",
    "we have excluded ngc  4151 due to its complex spectrum in the band which hinders a precise determination of its intrinsic photon index ( see weaver et  al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) as well as its strong optical line profile changes ( e.g. penston & prez 1984 ) .",
    "we have excluded ngc 6814 because it does not have measured photon indices in most of the tables of n97 ( due to its faintness ) and also because it shows persistent and strong optical line variability ( e.g. sekiguchi & menzies 1990 ) .",
    "we have excluded 3c  120 because it is radio loud and has superluminal motion .",
    "we have not used the n97 results for ngc  4051 or mrk  766 , and we discuss these two objects in more detail below .",
    "three objects in the n97 sample were observed by twice ( mcg63015 , mrk  841 and ngc  3783 ) , and we have used all six of these measurements in our analysis .",
    "our statistical results below do not materially change if we systematically use only the flattest , only the steepest , or the averaged n97 photon indices for these three objects .",
    "the n97 sample is composed of well - studied , hard x - ray bright seyfert 1s , as these were the seyfert 1s predominantly observed during early observations .",
    "it is biased against soft nls1 at some level .",
    "ngc  4051 and mrk  335 , the two objects in the n97 sample with the smallest h@xmath1 fwhm , have their similarities to nls1 discussed in section 5.1 of bbf96 .",
    "we have verified that radio - loud objects , which generally have flatter x - ray spectra than radio - quiet objects , are not affecting the trend shown in figure 1 .",
    "the n97 objects with large h@xmath1 fwhm are ` typical ' radio - quiet seyfert 1 galaxies such as ngc  3227 , ngc  3516 , ngc  3783 , ngc  5548 and fairall  9 .      the solid dots in figure 1 , from left to right ,",

    "iron line modelling has been included in the fitting when appropriate ( see the cited references for details ) . as with the n97 seyfert  1s , the photon indices for these objects do not appear to be sensitive to the details of the iron line modelling .",
    "the intrinsic hard photon indices of ngc  4051 and mrk  766 appear to be variable . for ngc  4051",
    ", we have used the photon index from the time averaged analysis in section 4.3 of guainazzi et  al .",
    "this photon index appears to provide a reasonable description of the typical source behaviour ( see figure 12 of guainazzi et  al .",
    "1997 ) . for mrk  766 , leighly",
    "( 1996 ) state that the 210  kev photon index varies abruptly between @xmath8 and @xmath9 when the source changes from a low state to a high state . the time averaged value is likely to be closer to 2.00 than 1.57 ( see leighly et  al .",
    "1996 for details ) , and table 2 of n97 gives a time averaged value of @xmath10 ( a similar value is obtained by hayashida 1997 ) .",
    "we adopt this value and show below that our statistical results are not sensitive to the precise photon index adopted for mrk  766 .",
    "all results discussed below should be implicitly taken to pertain to time averaged seyfert 1 behaviour , although most of the seyfert  1s in our sample did not show strong photon index variability during their observations .    figure  1 does not include the radio - loud objects from reynolds ( 1997 ) or highly luminous quasars ( with 210  kev luminosities larger than @xmath11 erg s@xmath12 ) as our interest here is in radio - quiet seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "we have not used ngc  2992 ( a narrow emission line galaxy with internal absorption ; nelg ) from the reynolds ( 1997 ) sample , due to the fact that its intrinsic photon index is not well determined by the data ( see weaver et  al .",
    "1996 ; also see section  1 for an explanation of why we are only interested in intrinsic photon indices ) .",
    "the 210  kev spectrum of ngc  2992 is strongly influenced by a time - delayed compton reflection continuum and other complexities which obscure the true shape of the underlying continuum .",
    "we have not plotted the nls1 iras  132243809 ( see boller et  al .",
    "1993 ) in figure 1 due to the fact that its 210 kev spectral shape appears to be highly variable and is poorly constrained by current data ( see table 4.4.1 of otani 1995 ) .",
    "its hard x - ray photon index appears to vary between roughly 1.32.3 , although the precise values obtained depend on details of the modelling .",
    "for comparison with figure 1 , iras  132243809 has an h@xmath1 fwhm of @xmath13 km  s@xmath12 , and hayashida ( 1997 ) gives a time averaged hard photon index of @xmath14 .",
    "while the objects in figure 1 are not drawn from a rigorously defined complete sample , we have used all the currently available radio - quiet seyfert 1s with reliably measured _ intrinsic _ photon indices in an attempt to avoid any biases .",
    "there are 34 data points in figure  1 .",
    "one possible selection effect is that several of the nls1 that have been observed with have been chosen as targets due to their soft spectra in the band .",
    "this does not invalidate comparisons made using the data in figure 1 , but it does restrict our comparison to that of soft spectra nls1 versus seyfert 1 galaxies with larger h@xmath1 fwhm . this is to be understood in all discussion below . if the @xmath15 versus h@xmath1 fwhm correlation , after correction for possible absorption effects in the band",
    ", is as tight as suggested by figure 5a of laor et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , then a distinction between soft nls1 and nls1 more generally may be unimportant .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies with both photon indices larger than 3 as well as h@xmath1 fwhm larger than 3000 km s@xmath12 appear to be strongly discriminated against by nature ( see section 1 ; pounds & brandt 1997 give the clearest illustration of this effect so far ) .",
    "thus the lack of observations of seyfert 1s with both large h@xmath1 fwhm and photon indices larger than 3 is not an artifical selection bias , but is rather due to a real and physically interesting effect .",
    "examination of figure  1 suggests that nls1 with soft spectra have @xmath16 more frequently than seyfert  1s with larger h@xmath1 fwhm .",
    "below we perform statistical tests to quantify the significance of the apparent trend in figure  1 .",
    "some of the statistical tests below are designed to compare two samples of objects .",
    "therefore , we have divided the seyfert 1s in figure 1 into two samples . the first sample ( hereafter nl for ` narrow lines ' )",
    "is composed of the objects with h@xmath1 fwhm smaller than 2000 km s@xmath12 . the second sample ( hereafter bl for ` broad lines ' )",
    "is composed of the objects with h@xmath1 fwhm larger than 2000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "we have chosen the 2000 km s@xmath12 dividing value of h@xmath1 fwhm based on the a priori definition for nls1 given in section ivb of stephens ( 1989 ) .",
    "however , we have included in nl rather than bl . as discussed in section 4.5 of brandt , fabian & pounds ( 1996 ) , which was written before",
    "the results were available , has many striking similarities to nls1 .",
    "in addition to its rather narrow balmer lines ( it has an h@xmath1 fwhm of 2100 km s@xmath12 ) , has a soft spectrum , strong optical fe ii emission and weak forbidden line emission ( see wills et  al . 1992 ) . as our goal below is to compare the hard photon index distributions of soft nls1 and seyfert  1s with larger h@xmath1 fwhm , inclusion of in nl",
    "is clearly warranted .",
    "we show later that our conclusions do not depend on the treatment of . in total",
    ", we have 15 photon indices in nl and 19 photon indices in bl .",
    "we first performed a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test to determine the probability that nl and bl were drawn from the same parent distribution function .",
    "this test is robust and nonparametric , although it does not provide formal information as to why two distributions are different ( i.e. they could differ in mean , variance , skewness or some other property , but the kolmogorov - smirnov test does not discriminate between these possibilities ) .",
    "nl and bl are large enough for the kolmogorov - smirnov test to be applicable ( see equation 14.3.10 of press et  al . 1992 and stephens 1970 ) .",
    "we obtain a kolmogorov - smirnov statistic of @xmath17 , and in figure  2 we plot the cumulative distribution functions for nl and bl used by the kolmogorov - smirnov test . given the value of @xmath18 we find that nl and bl have less than a 0.25 per cent chance of being drawn from the same parent distribution function , and figure 2 suggests that the main reason for the low probability is likely to be a difference in the central photon indices of nl and bl .    in order to obtain more descriptive information about the differences between nl and bl , we have calculated some of their moments .",
    "the mean photon index of nl is 2.15 , the variance of the nl photon indices is 0.036 and the standard error of the nl mean is 0.049 .",
    "the mean photon index of bl is 1.87 , the variance of the bl photon indices is 0.025 and the standard error of the bl mean is 0.036 .",
    "note that the nl mean photon index is @xmath19 standard errors larger than the bl mean photon index .",
    "we have used student s t - test ( for distributions with nonequal variances ; see press et  al .",
    "1992 ) to examine whether nl and bl have significantly different means .",
    "we obtain a t value of 4.73 . there is less than a 0.02 per cent chance that t could be this large or larger , for distributions with equal means . while student s t - test is a parametric test and is subject to the limitations described in chapter 3 of siegel ( 1956 ) , we nevertheless consider the large value of t to be suggestive .",
    "we have performed a spearman rank - order correlation using the data shown in figure 1 .",
    "this test is sensitive to any monotonic relation between two variables and is more general than pearson s r - test .",
    "as described in detail in siegel ( 1956 ) , it is nonparametric , robust and requires far fewer assumptions than parametric tests .",
    "it also does not require the division of the objects into nl and bl ( this division is somewhat artificial if there is a continuous trend present in figure  1 ) .",
    "we have checked our implementation of the spearman test using data from laor et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and we obtain entirely consistent results . using the data in figure  1 , we obtain a spearman @xmath20 value of @xmath21 . the spearman probability associated with this @xmath20 value is @xmath22 ( that is , there is less than a 0.1 per cent chance of obtaining a spearman @xmath20 value with this large a magnitude by chance ) .",
    "thus , the spearman rank - order correlation indicates that there is a highly significant anticorrelation between h@xmath1 fwhm and hard photon index for the objects in figure 1 .",
    "we have performed several safety checks to examine the reliability of our statistical results .",
    "first of all , we have verified that they do not depend on any single data point in figure  1 .",
    "this is understandable since the kolmogorov - smirnov and spearman tests we have employed are relatively insensitive to outlying points .",
    "for example , we still find strong evidence for an anticorrelation even if the most extreme nls1 illustrated , re  j  1034 + 393 , is neglected . running the spearman rank - order correlation without re  j  1034 + 393",
    ", we obtain an @xmath20 value of @xmath23 and a spearman probability of @xmath24 .",
    "however , there is no known reason why re  j  1034 + 393 , or any other object in figure  1 , should be neglected .    conservatively using the flat photon index for mrk  766 from section 4.1 of leighly et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) does not change our basic statistical results . using the flat photon index ,",
    "we obtain @xmath25 and a spearman probability of @xmath26 .",
    "we have also verified that the inclusion of ngc  2992 or iras  132243809 ( see section 2.1.2 ) does not change our basic statistical conclusions . including in bl rather than nl",
    "does not affect the anticorrelation , because the spearman analysis does not depend on the division into nl and bl .",
    "if we use the hard photon indices from table 4 of n97 , which do not include compton reflection in the spectral fitting , the trend suggested above is not affected .",
    "in fact , it becomes statistically stronger because all the squares in figure  1 shift downward ( on the average by @xmath27 ) .    as the photon indices in figure 1 have errors associated with them , we have performed monte - carlo simulations to verify that it is not just a chance realization of the best - fitting photon index values that leads to the apparent anticorrelation .",
    "in these simulations we generate sets of photon indices based on the data points and errors in figure 1 , and we then perform spearman rank - order correlations using these sets .",
    "we generate the photon indices from gaussian distributions centred on the points in figure 1 , and we follow the conservative prescriptions in section 2.1 of n97 regarding the translation of confidence limits into gaussian @xmath28 values . in 94.0 per cent of the simulations , we can rule out a chance anticorrelation with greater than 99 per cent confidence . in 99.7 per cent of the simulations",
    ", we can rule out a chance anticorrelation with greater than 95 per cent confidence .",
    "note that the 95 per cent confidence level stated here does not mean that we have weakened our threshold for correlation testing .",
    "it is only used to describe the ( in itself unlikely ) tail of the distribution of spearman probabilities that arises from our monte carlo calculations .",
    "it is unlikely that our statistical results are due to a chance realization of the best fitting photon index values .",
    "the currently available data suggest , with high statistical significance , that soft nls1 have generally steeper 210 kev intrinsic spectral slopes than seyfert 1s with larger h@xmath1 fwhm .",
    "note that this is a robust statistical statement regarding two populations , and that the discovery of a single discrepant seyfert  1 is unlikely to alter it .",
    "the trend suggested by figure  1 appears similar to the well - established @xmath15/h@xmath1 fwhm trend , although the range of photon indices in figure  1 ( @xmath0 1.62.6 ) is about half that seen in lower - energy data ( @xmath0 1.94.2 ) .",
    "soft excesses probably lead to the larger photon index dispersion observed in the band . however , soft excesses are thought to be confined to below about 1  kev .",
    "figure  1 uses no data below 2  kev , and thus the hard photon index trend illustrated there would probe different and new seyfert physics . as discussed by pdo95 , photons from the soft excesses of ultrasoft nls1 could compton cool the coronae which create their harder flux and thereby steepen their 210  kev continua ( also see maraschi & haardt 1997 ) .",
    "if this is indeed the cause of the observed effect , then comparative studies of soft nls1 and seyfert  1s with broader permitted lines will have provided one of the first direct illustrations of a physical process that influences the origin of the underlying hard x - ray continua from seyfert galaxies .",
    "other possibilities , such as significant curvature in the underlying 210  kev continua of some seyfert  1s , also need further examination ( for a detailed study see brandt et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "some researchers have considered models for nls1 in which they are seyfert 1s viewed along a particular line of sight ( e.g. highly pole - on ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; puchnarewicz et  al .",
    "1992 ) , although such models appear to have trouble explaining all the known optical line ( e.g. boroson 1992 ; but also see he s , barthel & fosbury 1993 for evidence that [ o  iii ] may not be isotropic ) and x - ray properties .",
    "if , despite current indications , a special orientation does turn out to be the root cause of nls1 properties then the hard photon index trend described here would require the hard power - law shapes of seyfert 1s to be orientation dependent .",
    "additional analyses of nls1 ( e.g. ton  s  180 , rx  j  014827 and iras  201812244 ) are needed to further study the hard photon index trend suggested here .",
    "they will thereby probe the full range of seyfert 1 spectral shapes ( cf .",
    "elvis 1992 ) and clarify the extent to which historical and other selection effects have influenced measurements of the dispersion of seyfert 1 hard x - ray slopes .",
    "it would also be of great interest to see if an analogous trend is found in higher luminosity seyfert 1 type quasars .",
    "the laor et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample is an obvious one in which to search for such a trend , although it may not have enough ultrasoft quasars to provide definitive results .",
