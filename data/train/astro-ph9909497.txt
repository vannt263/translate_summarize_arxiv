    "future cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments will provide high resolution sky maps covering a wide range of frequencies .",
    "in addition to the cosmological cmb signal those maps will contain instrumental noise and contributions from galactic and extragalactic foregrounds .",
    "the denoising of these maps as well as the separation of the different components from the cmb signal are the most challenging problems for cmb cosmology",
    ". the final goal would be to reconstruct cmb maps trying not to loose structural details as well as to recover the radiation power spectrum with the minimum error . in a first approach to these problems we present in this paper a denoising technique based on wavelets .",
    "previously there have been other works based in the use of wiener filter ( tegmark and efstathiou @xcite ) and maximum entropy methods ( hobson et al .",
    "the use of denoising methods based on wavelets have certain advantages as providing information of the contribution of different scales , being computationally faster ( 0(n ) ) and not requiring iterative processes .",
    "the analysis of discrete 2-dimensional images with wavelets can be performed following different approaches . the two computationally faster algorithms are the ones based on multiresolution analysis ( mallat @xcite ) and on 2d wavelet analysis ( lemari and meyer @xcite ) , using tensor products of one dimensional wavelets .",
    "a study of denoising of cmb maps using the former method has been presented in sanz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this method is based on a single scale and three ` details ' at each resolution level .",
    "the 2-d wavelet method used in this work is based on two scales , providing therefore more information on different resolutions ( defined by the product of the two scales ) than the multiresolution one .",
    "moreover this technique is adapted to separable wavelets .",
    "on the other hand , an analysis of denoising using spherical wavelets has been recently carried out by tenorio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in @xmath5",
    "we present some basic ideas about the continuous 2d wavelet transform .",
    "we apply 2-d wavelets to the analysis of discrete 2d cmb anisotropy maps of small sky patches in @xmath6 and the conclusions are presented in @xmath7 .",
    "this section is dedicated to present the continuous form of the 2d wavelet approach we are later using to analyse discrete cmb maps . as a difference with the multiresolution approach used in sanz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) the 2d wavelet method provides information on many more resolution elements than the former method .",
    "moreover , this property is crucial for preforming an efficient linear denoising preserving the gaussianity of the underlying cmb field ( as will be discussed in @xmath8 ) .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform of a 2d signal @xmath9 is defined as + @xmath10 @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the wavelet coefficient associated to the scales @xmath13 and @xmath14 at the point with coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the limits in the double integral are @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the two variables .",
    "@xmath19 is the wavelet ` mother ' function that satisfies the constraints @xmath20    and the ` admissibility ' condition ( that allows to reconstruct the function @xmath21 ) , i.e. there exists the integral @xmath22    where @xmath23 represents the 2d fourier transform of @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes the modulus of the complex number .",
    "a reconstruction of the image can be achieved with the inversion formula @xmath26    next , let us introduce the scalogram of a 2d signal @xmath27    where @xmath28 means the average value calculated on the image .",
    "hereinafter , we shall consider 2d wavelets that are separable , i.e. @xmath29 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath30 . in particular , we are interested in the haar , the mexican hat and the daubechies 2d - transforms that can be generated in terms of the corresponding 1d wavelets . for the haar case , we find @xmath31    with an absolute maximum at @xmath32 , whereas for the mexican hat @xmath33    with a single peak at @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding formulae for the daubechies wavelets of order @xmath35 can be found in ogden ( @xcite ) .",
    "the last wavelets form an orthonormal basis with compact support , increasing regularity with @xmath35 and vanishing moments up to order @xmath36 .",
    "just as an illustration we would like to present the scalogram for a cmb signal generated in a standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model .",
    "let us assume that the image corresponds to a realization of a random field whose 2-point correlation function is homogeneous and isotropic : @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "this is equivalent to assume that the fourier components @xmath39 satisfy @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , is the standard fourier power spectrum and @xmath28 means average value over realizations of the field ( the ergodicity of the field is assumed ) .",
    "so , taking average values and using equations ( 1 ) and ( 6 ) , one obtains the variance @xmath43 of the wavelet coefficients or scalogram @xmath44    for 2d white noise , i.e. @xmath45 , one gets that the scalogram , @xmath46 , is constant at any scale .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the field @xmath21 represents the temperature anisotropy of the cmb , @xmath47 , one can obtain @xmath48    from the previous equation , @xmath49 represents the power per logarithmic scale .",
    "we remark that taking into account the homogeneity and isotropy of the field , the 2-scale dependence of the scalogram is redundant in this case",
    ". a more appropriate treatment in this continuous example would be one based on isotropic wavelets defined in terms of a single scale .    in the top panel of figure  [ figura1.a ]",
    "we have represented the scalogram against the two scales @xmath13 and @xmath50 for scdm using the haar transform .",
    "the qualitative behaviour for the other transforms is similar . in the bottom panel",
    "we compare the scalogram along the diagonal for standard , open ( @xmath51 ) and a flat-@xmath3 ( @xmath52 ) cdm models using the haar and the mexican hat transforms .",
    "the qualitative behaviour for the two transforms is similar : there is a plateau for @xmath53 and a maximum dependent on @xmath54 , corresponding to the first doppler peak .",
    "other secondary maxima appearing in the figure are related to the secondary peaks in the standard @xmath55 radiation power spectrum ( the @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 ) .",
    "therefore , the position and amplitude of the maxima that appear in the scalogram is model dependent , being this quantity tightly related to the @xmath55 s .",
    "in general for a grid of @xmath58 pixels , a discretization of the parameters of the form : @xmath59 for integer - valued @xmath60 and @xmath61 allows to introduce the 2d discrete wavelet function @xmath62    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the dilation and the translation indexes , respectively , satisfying @xmath65 .",
    "the resolution level is defined by @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "we also introduce a scaling function @xmath68 that allows to define a complete basis to reconstruct discrete images , @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    we will consider orthonormal discrete bases as the haar and daubechies ones . denoting by @xmath3 any of the previous functions , the orthonormality condition reads : @xmath72    where @xmath73 denotes the scalar product of two functions in @xmath74 .",
    "the wavelet coefficients are now defined by @xmath75    the image is reconstructed using the following expression : @xmath76    a representation of the wavelet coefficients can be done by a square that contains small squares and rectangles associated to different levels of resolution . the first level , representing high - resolution , is @xmath77 ( i.e. @xmath78 ) that contains @xmath79 wavelet coefficients ( each one constructed with @xmath80 pixels for the haar transform ) .",
    "the second level of resolution contains two boxes : @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( i.e. @xmath83 ) with a total of @xmath84 wavelet coefficients ( each one constructed with @xmath85 pixels for the haar transform ) .",
    "the levels with @xmath86 ( or @xmath87 ) contain both contributions from wavelet - wavelet and scaling - wavelet ( or wavelet - scaling ) . finally , the lower level of resolution is @xmath88 ( i.e. @xmath89 ) and contains four contributions : wavelet - wavelet , wavelet - scaling , scaling - wavelet and scaling - scaling ( this last one is proportional to the average value of the image for the haar transform ) .      in the present work we have considered simulated maps of size @xmath90 square degrees ,",
    "pixel @xmath91 and filtered with a @xmath92 fwhm gaussian beam for a standard cdm model ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we have included non - correlated gaussian noise at different levels ( s / n per pixel between 0.7 and 3 at the pixel scale ) , considering uniform and non - uniform noise .",
    "this last case is introduced to account for the non - uniform sampling of satellite observations . as an extreme case",
    "we have simulated a noise map with two different regions , one with @xmath94 ( approximately one quarter of the map ) and a second one with @xmath95 .",
    "the purpose of the denosing of cmb maps is to reconstruct the original signal map as well as the radiation power spectrum @xmath56 .",
    "wavelet decompositions are performed with the package _ 2d - w _ developed by our group .",
    "the procedure uses two scales , @xmath96,@xmath97 , @xmath98 in our case .",
    "high values of @xmath99 mean high resolution , i.e. , small scales .",
    "we distribute the coefficients @xmath100 in boxes corresponding to a couple @xmath101 , having a total of @xmath102 boxes .",
    "the coefficients related to the scaling function are not included in the analysis and they are left untouched . to perform denoising , the basic operation is the comparison between the wavelet coefficients dispersion of the signal in each box with the one of the noise .",
    "the gaussian white noise gives the same contribution in all boxes .",
    "since the signal is negligible at the highest resolutions , the noise dispersion can be directly estimated from the map .",
    "therefore , the signal dispersion can also be estimated for each box .    in figure  [ figura2 ]",
    ", we plot the s / n ratio ( defined in terms of the wavelet coefficients dispersions of signal and noise ) for each box for a cmb simulation with @xmath103 in real space .    for the case of uniform noise , all boxes where the signal dominates ( @xmath104 )",
    "are kept untouched , whereas those with a high level of noise ( @xmath105 ) are removed . on the other hand ,",
    "the boxes in between are treated with a soft thresholding technique .",
    "given a threshold @xmath106 in terms of the noise coefficients dispersion ( @xmath107 ) , the coefficients @xmath108 are rescaled as @xmath109 ( where the @xmath110,@xmath111 signs correspond to negative and positive values of @xmath112 respectively ) , whereas the remaining coefficients are set to zero . the threshold @xmath106 for each box is chosen using the sure method ( donoho & johnstone @xcite ) .",
    "the threshold is obtained by minimization of an unbiased estimate of the expected mean squared error of the estimation of the signal wavelet coefficients ( see for instance ogden @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ figura2 ] , the thresholds obtained with the sure technique are plotted for a cmb map with @xmath113 .",
    "as expected , lower s / n levels are treated with higher thresholds , i.e. , more coefficients are removed .",
    "changing the range of s / n where the soft technique is applied ( providing is around @xmath113 ) , does not appreciably change these results .",
    "we have used daubechies 4 but we obtain little or no variations if we adopt higher order daubechies wavelets .",
    "however , the haar transform gives worse results .",
    "table 1 shows the error in the map reconstructions for different @xmath4 ratios with gaussian uniform noise .",
    "the error improvement achieved with the denoising technique applied goes from factors of @xmath114 to @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "the four top panels of figure  [ mapas ] show cmb maps with only signal ( scdm ) , signal plus noise with a @xmath113 , the reconstructed map using wavelets and the residual one .",
    ".reconstruction errors ( % ) [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     regarding non - uniform ( n.u . ) noise , wavelet techniques allow us to treat each location in the image separately . at each fixed location and fixed @xmath101 we calculate the dispersion of the corresponding noise wavelet coefficient from 500 simulations of our non - uniform noise .",
    "since we consider non - uniform noise that is uncorrelated , the average noise dispersion is the same for all the boxes , as in the uniform noise case .",
    "therefore , we can get again the dispersion of the signal for each @xmath101 pair as well as the s / n ratio for each coefficient .",
    "those coefficients with s / n ratio in the considered range ( @xmath117 ) are treated with a soft thresholding technique , whereas the rest are either kept or removed depending on their s / n ratio . since in presence of non - uniform noise , we can not use the sure technique to estimate the optimal threshold @xmath106 ( as far as we know , work is in progress to define a general threshold in the case of non - uniform noise , von sachs & mcgibbon @xcite ) , we choose for all the thresholded coefficients @xmath118 .",
    "this threshold is defined with respect to the noise dispersion in each particular coefficient .",
    "we have chosen this value of @xmath106 because it gives a good reconstruction when comparing with the original map , but the results are not very sensitive to the choice of a different threshold in the range @xmath119 . in table 1",
    "we present the error of the reconstructed map in the presence of non - uniform noise as considered in this work .",
    "regarding the power spectrum , @xmath56 , the denoising method performs very well .",
    "figures  [ psreconstruido ] and  [ relativo ] show the reconstructed spectrum and the relative error for @xmath120 for different @xmath4 ratios ( the power spectrum is obtained in the usual way , averaging over the fourier modes of the considered map at each @xmath121 ) .",
    "the relative error is @xmath122 @xmath123 for @xmath124 in all the considered cases except for the map with @xmath125 . in this last case",
    "the error increases to @xmath126 for the same range of @xmath127 .",
    "finally , we have looked for possible non - gaussian features introduced by the non - linearity of the soft thresholding technique . we have compared the probability density function of the original and the reconstructed maps using a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "both distributions are compatible at similar or higher levels than the original map and the corresponding linear reconstruction obtained with the wiener filter technique .",
    "moreover , not significant change is observed in the skewness and kurtosis of the original and reconstructed maps .",
    "however , the application of soft thresholding to the wavelet coefficients at a certain level , which are gaussian distributed for a gaussian temperature field , clearly changes their distribution by removing all coefficients whose absolute values are below the imposed threshold and shifting the remaining ones by that threshold .",
    "therefore , this technique is introducing a certain level of non - gaussianity that will depend on the threshold imposed and that should be taken into account when analysing the data .",
    "if we are mainly concern about preserving the gaussian character of the reconstructed image , denoising with wavelet techniques is still possible .",
    "instead of using a soft thresholding technique , we can apply a linear denoising method in wavelet space .",
    "in particular , we have removed all wavelet coefficients at boxes with @xmath128 and left the rest untouched .",
    "the reconstruction errors get only slightly worse with this simple linear technique as shown in table  [ errores ] .",
    "regarding the reconstructed power spectrum , this is at the same level than the sure reconstruction ( see top - right panel of figure  [ relativo ] ) for all the considered cases .",
    "it is important to remark that the linear denoising method based on 2d wavelets performs much better than the multiresolution one due to the larger number of boxes corresponding to the product of the 2 scales considered .      a comparison between wiener filter ( see for instance press et al .",
    "@xcite ) and wavelet techniques has also been performed . in relation to map reconstruction the error affecting the wiener reconstructed maps is comparable to that achieved with wavelet techniques in all the considered cases .",
    "however , in order to apply wiener filter previous knowledge of the signal power spectrum is required . in a real situation",
    "this may well not be possible .",
    "the reconstructed and residual maps using wiener filter are shown in figure  [ mapas ] .",
    "in addition , when using wiener filter , the power spectrum of the reconstructed image is clearly suppressed at high @xmath127 , giving much worse results than the wavelet technique . for comparison , we have plotted in figure  [ relativo ] the absolute value of the relative error of the @xmath129 for the reconstructions with wiener filter . on the other hand",
    ", one could recover the @xmath130 s of the original signal by subtracting from the power spectrum of the signal plus noise map the estimated power spectrum of the noise , which is constant at each @xmath131 .",
    "however , this method gives in general worse results than the wavelet techniques and besides can not be used to reconstruct the image .",
    "we have also applied a maximum entropy method to the maps used in this work , with the definition of entropy given by hobson & lasenby ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method provides reconstruction errors at similar levels as the wavelet techniques .",
    "however , we remark that wavelet techniques are computationally faster 0(n ) and simpler to apply ( not requiring iterative processes ) than maximum entropy methods .",
    "we have considered the 2d wavelet transform with two scales to analyse cmb maps .",
    "first of all we present the continuous approach to the 2d wavelet . a discrete analysis is performed for a finite image . in this case , a scaling function is introduced in order to define a 2d wavelet basis .",
    "the 2d wavelet technique has been applied to denoise cmb maps for s / n ratios ranging between @xmath132 and @xmath114 .",
    "we have also considered the case of non - uniform gaussian noise . a factor between @xmath115 and @xmath114",
    "is gained for the reconstructed images / original signal map in relation to the signal plus noise maps / original signal map . regarding the @xmath129 , the relative errors are below a @xmath123 up to @xmath133 for all the cases with s / n @xmath134 . a comparison with wiener filter and maximum entropy method has also been performed .",
    "the later gives comparable reconstructions to the wavelet method , being however slower and more complicated to apply .",
    "wiener filter provides reconstructed maps with errors comparable to the wavelet technique we propose .",
    "however , unlike the wavelet method , wiener filter requires previous knowledge of the signal power spectrum .",
    "moreover , the @xmath135 of the denoised map obtaining by applying wiener filter are clearly underestimated .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that linear wavelet denoising , which preserves gaussianity , gives reconstruction errors similar to those obtained with the non - linear soft thresholding techniques .",
    "moreover , linear denoising is better achieved by 2d wavelets than by the multiresolution ones discussed in sanz et al .",
