    "for understanding the ads / cft correspondence at the string level it is useful to peruse construction of classical string configurations moving in ads spacetime .",
    "the theory is classically ( and probably also quantum mechanically ) integrable and following the experience with two dimensional integrable field theories the construction of its exact solution might be possible . at present",
    "particular examples representing classical motions in ads are known .",
    "the first example is given by the rotating folded string of gkp.@xcite it was established to be dual to twist two ( large ) spin operators of super yang - mills ( sym ) theory whose anomalous dimensions are of interest for scattering processes of qcd .",
    "an extension of the folded string solution is given by the n - spike configuration constructed by kruczenski.@xcite these solutions are special in that they represent static configurations in a uniformly rotating reference frame .",
    "one therefore expects a potentially much larger set of solutions with nontrivial dynamics .    in this contribution",
    "we describe our recent effort@xcite in developing techniques for generating ads string solutions . as it has been much studied recently the string in ads ( or more generally in the full @xmath1 spacetime ) is integrable both at the classical and quantum level . in",
    "conformal type gauges the equations are that of nonlinear sigma models defined on the spaces in question .",
    "one well known approach to study integrability of sigma models and generate classical solutions is based on a pohlmeyer type reduction@xcite in which the invariant dynamics is identified with the dynamics of sine - gordon ( or more generally of toda ) type .",
    "the other well known method is the dressing method , which was successfully applied for construction of magnon type solutions.@xcite@xcite    in the study of ads dynamics we follow the inverse scattering method where one generates string configurations starting with soliton solutions of the reduced field theory .",
    "this method was originally applied in ref . for the study of string dynamics in de sitter space . in anti de sitter space",
    "we have found a natural identification of soliton configurations , they were identified in ref . with spikes of string foldings present in the gubser - klebanov - polyakov - kruczenski ( gkp - k ) solution .",
    "we will review this identification in what follows and give a more in depth discussion of it .",
    "the rotating string solutions of gkp - k simplify drastically in the limit @xmath2 , when the rotational momentum is maximal . in that limit",
    "the spikes extend to the boundary of the ads space but in the process some features of the solution get lost .",
    "we will describe at the sinh - gordon level the intricacies of the @xmath2 limit and then proceed with the discussion of the @xmath3 case .",
    "while we concentrate on the two - soliton consideration we outline the construction for the ( static ) n - soliton case .    in the euclidean worldsheet framework alday and maldacena",
    "have used minimal area classical string configurations to evaluate scattering amplitudes of yang - mills gluons@xcite in terms of wilson loops.@xcite in this case the momenta of individual gluons specify a polygon geometry of the string worldsheet .",
    "it is then a challenging problem to construct minimal area string configurations with general n - polygon boundary conditions@xcite@xcite .",
    "this was accomplished in ref .",
    "for the four - point case through an analytic continuation of minkowski worldsheet solutions described above .",
    "one has the expectation that knowledge of more general minkowski space solutions can therefore be of use for the gluon scattering problem also .",
    "we will concentrate in what follows on string dynamics in purely ads spacetime .",
    "the string equations of motion in curved spacetime can be formulated as generalized nonlinear @xmath4 models provided one uses a conformal type gauge . defining the @xmath5 space as @xmath6 , the conformal gauge string equations are given by a noncompact @xmath7-symmetric @xmath4 model with the action @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the minkowski worldsheet coordinates , the equations of motion are @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to guarantee the conformal gauge we have to impose the virasoro conditions @xmath12    it was demonstrated a number of years ago ( by pohlmeyer ) that nonlinear sigma models subject to virasoro type constraints can be reduced to known , integrable field equations of sine - gordon ( or toda ) type .",
    "this reduction is accomplished by concentrating on @xmath7 invariant sub - dynamics of the sigma model .",
    "the steps of the reduction were well described in refs .  and consist in the following .",
    "one starts by identifying first an appropriate set of basis vectors for the string coordinates . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the basis can be chosen as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a fourth orthonormal vector , satisfying @xmath16 .",
    "the reduced ( invariant ) scalar field is introduced through a scalar product @xmath17 , and one proceeds to derive the equation of motion for @xmath18 , which reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two additional ( invariant ) scalar fields given by @xmath22 .",
    "they are found to obey the equations @xmath23 and now the closed set of equations defines the generalized sinh - gordon model .",
    "one can next work out the equations obeyed by the elements of the basis , the derivatives of the vectors ( [ basis1 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the basis itself @xmath24 where @xmath25 one finds therefore a linear system of differential equations for the vectors .",
    "the associated integrability condition reads @xmath26=0.\\ ] ] the integrability condition is then seen to generate the equations of motion corresponding to a generalized sinh - gordon theory .",
    "the vector equations on the other hand define the motion ( and coordinates ) of the string itself , they have to be solved , which leads to a scattering problem of dirac type .",
    "this equations exhibit @xmath27 symmetry , and can be further simplified by redefining the orthonormal basis as@xcite @xmath28 then the @xmath29 matrices become @xmath30 one now exploits the fact that @xmath31 , expanding the @xmath29 matrices in terms of two commuting sets of @xmath32 generators @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "remember @xmath35 , we can rewrite this problem in terms of the spinor representation of the @xmath36 group . defining two spinors @xmath37 and @xmath38 satisfying the differential equations @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the anti - hermitian generators of @xmath36 group .",
    "the matrices @xmath41 can be found in ref . .",
    "the string solution is finally given by @xmath42",
    "gubser , klebanov and polyakov@xcite pointed out the relevance of semiclassical quantization in ads giving the example of a large @xmath43 ( spin angular momentum ) rigidly rotating string .",
    "one constructs the gkp solution in the conformal gauge with the sigma model action @xmath44 and the virasoro constraints @xmath45 the classical motion describing a rigid rotation of a folded closed string is given by the ansatz @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the virasoro constraints give @xmath48 where the scaling constant @xmath49 is adjusted to define the period of @xmath4 .",
    "we can set @xmath50 and denote the position of the fold ( spike ) as @xmath51 . to demonstrate the stated correspondence with solitons we expand the solution ( [ gkpsolution ] ) near the spike with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , one finds @xmath54 denoting @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 .",
    "consider the boundary condition @xmath57 at @xmath58 , one finds @xmath59 so that @xmath60 this is exactly the one - soliton solution to the sinh - gordon equation @xmath61.@xcite the closed gkp solution has two folds ( spikes ) and therefore corresponds in the sinh - gordon picture to a two - soliton configuration .",

    "due to the nonvanishing boundary condition at infinity , there is momentum flow at the boundary of the string and the energy is not conserved .",
    "these were the features of the one soliton string configuration given in ref . .",
    "it is also interesting to note another limit which leads to vacuum at @xmath74 .",

    "the corresponding string solution is given by @xmath80 as we expected , in the limit of @xmath74 , this solution reduces to the vacuum string solution in ref . .",
    "these two limits at @xmath74 are essentially expanding the sinh - gordon solution around the soliton ( region 1 ) and the vacuum ( region 2 ) , respectively , as shown in fig .",

    "following the discussion of the periodic two - soliton ( gkp ) solution ( see fig . [ f2](a ) ) , we would like to consider a possible n - soliton generalization . in terms of a naive gluing procedure",
    "one would be lead to a configuration given in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) . at the sinh - gordon level",
    "the analogue construction is simple , one essentially extends the length of the space to accommodate n static solitons .",
    "however it does not follow that this configuration is continuous and nonsingular in the string configuration space .",
    "we have the fact that at the center of ads space where @xmath91 , there results only two solutions of ( [ gkpsolution ] ) : @xmath92 ( see fig . [ f3](a ) ) .",
    "this allows for two angles : 0 and @xmath93 which corresponds to the gluing in the case of a gkp configuration .",
    "this implies that the string extends along a straight line . in the physical gauge @xmath94 kruczenski@xcite succeeded with the construction of a n - spike static configurations ( see fig . [ f2](c ) ) .",
