    "the electronic transport in mesoscopic systems has been intensively studied during the last decades.@xcite the conductance of mesoscopic wires is usually computed using the bttiker - landauer formalism , @xcite which accounts for the quantum mechanical nature of transmission and reflection through impurities and works well for fermi liquids .",
    "recent advances in nanotechnology , together with the discovery of carbon nanotubes @xcite have enabled the fabrication of extremely narrow wires , which are basically one - dimensional .",
    "because the electron - electron interactions become essential in 1d , these quantum wires exhibit luttinger liquid behavior , i.e. , they have bosonic collective excitations , instead of the usual fermionic quasi - particles present in conventional fermi liquids.@xcite    the role played by impurities in a luttinger liquid depends crucially on the nature of the interactions .",
    "in pathbreaking papers , kane and fisher@xcite showed that the impurity barrier is irrelevant if the electrons have attractive interactions ( @xmath3 ) , but it cuts the wire into two pieces if they interact repulsively ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "for the noninteracting case ( @xmath5 ) the barrier is a marginal perturbation , i.e. , one can have both , transmission and reflection .    for the case of two barriers , contrarily to the expectation , it is possible to have transmission even in the presence of repulsive interactions ( @xmath4 ) because quasi - bound - states can form between the barriers , which lead to resonant transmission.@xcite    the vast majority of cases discussed in the literature concerning transport in luttinger liquids involve _ static _ _ point - like _ impurity barriers .",
    "recently , the case of _ dynamical point - like _ impurities was addressed.@xcite feldman and gefen@xcite have shown that in the presence of one impurity oscillating with frequency @xmath6 , the backscattering current may change sign and the conductance of a single - mode luttinger liquid with strong repulsive interactions ( @xmath7 ) may become _ larger _ than the quantum of conductance @xmath8 .",
    "we have generalized their results and shown that in the presence of several impurities this phenomenon occurs even for @xmath9.@xcite in fact , we have found that the dc - current can always be expressed in terms of the backscattering current off a static impurity .",
    "the effect of the impurity frequency @xmath6 is solely to split the energy modes into @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the josephson frequency , associated with the external voltage @xmath13 .",
    "hence , within first order perturbation theory , several point - like impurities oscillating in phase may lead to an increase of the conductance , in a certain range of parameters , but in the entire regime of repulsive interactions @xmath14.@xcite    after having understood the role of _ time - dependent point - like impurities _ , the remaining task is to investigate transport through _ extended time - dependent _",
    "impurities.@xcite this is precisely the aim of this paper .",
    "the coherent transport properties of multimode quantum channels in the presence of gaussian - like scatterers was considered recently.@xcite in addition , the tunneling current between two counterpropagating edge modes described by chiral luttinger liquids was calculated for the case when tunneling takes place along an extended region.@xcite    in this work we evaluate the backscattering current off _ several time - dependent extended impurities _ in an otherwise perfect luttinger liquid , in the presence of repulsive electron - electron interactions .",
    "we start in section ii with a single static extended impurity in the noninteracting limit ( @xmath15 ) , which can be solved using the bttiker - landauer formalism,@xcite and then we generalize the results for the case of an arbitrary static potential . in section iii",
    "we include interactions among the electrons and study the problem using the keldysh formalism . within first order perturbation theory",
    ", we first derive a general expression for the backscattering current in the presence of several time - dependent extended impurities and then we concentrate on a typical example , namely , the case of one impurity , to illustrate the main results .",
    "finally , we compare our findings obtained within perturbation theory in the limit of noninteracting electrons ( @xmath5 ) with the exact results derived in the framework of the bttiker - landauer formalism and show a perfect agreement between them .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section iv .",

    "<S> we study the transport properties of a quantum wire , described by the tomonaga - luttinger model , in the presence of a backscattering potential provided by several extended time - dependent impurities ( barriers ) . employing the b \" uttiker - landauer approach , </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the scattering of noninteracting electrons ( @xmath0 ) by a rectangular - like barrier and find an exact solution for the backscattering current , as well as a perturbative solution for a weak static potential with an arbitrary shape . </S>",
    "<S> we then include electron - electron interactions and use the keldysh formalism combined with the bosonization technique to study oscillating extended barriers . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the backscattering current off time - dependent impurities can be expressed in terms of the current for the corresponding static barrier . </S>",
    "<S> then we determine the backscattering current for a static extended potential , which , in the limit of noninteracting electrons ( @xmath0 ) , coincides with the result obtained using the b \" uttiker - landauer formalism . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the conductance can be increased beyond its quantized value in the whole range of repulsive interactions @xmath1 already in the case of a single oscillating extended impurity , in contrast to the case of a point - like impurity , where this phenomenon occurs only for @xmath2 . </S>"
