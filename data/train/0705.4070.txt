    "neutrino oscillations in matter @xcite with the resonant amplification of a small vacuum mixing angle @xcite , although a much attractive mechanism , has not proven to be the origin of the solar neutrino deficit . while also an oscillation and resonant effect , the large mixing angle solution ( lma ) @xcite has instead become generally accepted as the dominant one @xcite . in the lma mechanism the conversion from active electron neutrinos produced in the solar core to weakly interacting ones of another flavour takes place through a strongly adiabatic resonance occuring still at the solar core .",
    "the order parameter is a large vacuum mixing of the order of @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "the time variability of the active neutrino event rate had been hinted long ago by the chlorine collaboration @xcite who suggested a possible anticorrelation of active neutrino flux with sunspot activity .",
    "it was then interpreted by voloshin , vysotskii and okun @xcite as a neutrino magnetic moment effect , such that an intense sunspot activity would induce a conversion of a large fraction of neutrinos into undetectable ones ( either steriles or of a different flavour ) through the interaction of the magnetic moment with the solar magnetic field .",
    "hence a more intense solar activity would correspond to a smaller flux of detectable neutrinos and viceversa .",
    "an interesting evolution of this proposal was the suggestion in 1987 by lim and marciano @xcite and by akhmedov @xcite that the neutrino spin flavour precession could take place anywhere inside the sun via a resonant process .",
    "this enhances the mechanism and allows for a smaller neutrino magnetic moment in order to produce a visible effect .",
    "the resonant spin flavour precession ( rsfp ) bears a resemblance to matter oscillations and is a result of the balance between matter density and the product @xmath10 ( neutrino magnetic moment times the solar field ) .",
    "the interpretation of solar data is at present still partly ambiguous , with several scenarios involving rsfp @xcite and non - standard neutrino interactions @xcite being viable .",
    "our knowledge of the solar neutrinos relies essentially on the data from the high energy sector ( mainly the @xmath11 flux ) , whereas the overwhelming low and intermediate energy one remains vastly unknown , except for the integrated measurements provided by the radiochemical experiments .",
    "as pointed out earlier @xcite , the observed decrease of the gallium event rate @xcite opens the question of whether there is time variability affecting only the low energy sector and has motivated the investigation of rsfp to light sterile neutrinos in combination with lma .",
    "lma+rsfp thus requires a sizable neutrino magnetic moment and a strong field at times of intense solar activity and a weak field otherwise , which causes the modulations in the neutrino event rate .",
    "low energy solar neutrino experiments like borexino @xcite , kamland @xcite and sno+ will no doubt help in clarifying the situation within the next few years .",
    "the first borexino data , very recently released @xcite , are compatible with the rsfp model predictions @xcite earlier derived since those data were taken during the present year ( 2007 ) when the magnetic solar activity is at a minimum .",
    "besides our limited knowledge of the low energy neutrino sector , one of the key inputs of solar models , namely the amount of heavy element abundance relative to hydrogen , @xmath12 , is still unclear @xcite .",
    "this affects the neutrino fluxes , in particular most strongly the cno ones and to a lesser extent the @xmath13 one .",
    "two classes of standard solar models ( ssms ) may at present be distinguished @xcite , one with a high value of @xmath12 @xcite and another with a low one @xcite , hereby denoted by ssm  i and ssm  ii , respectively .",
    "in the first the metallicity is consistent with sound speed , convective zone depth and density profiles , in excellent agreement with helioseismology .",
    "such is not the case in the second one which is however based on an improved modeling of the solar atmosphere .",
    "as uncertainties are considerable , we will in the present paper take both models into account .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse the possibility of the proposed sno+ experiment to ascertain on whether rsfp occurs at low and/or intermediate energies .",
    "we will also investigate the possible signatures of the two classes of ssms , in particular whether it is possible to distinguish between them with data from the forthcoming sno+ and from the chlorine @xcite experiment .",
    "for neutrino - electron scattering experiments , sensitivity to neutrino physics depends on the accuracy of solar models , since the calculation of the electron neutrino survival probability relies on the comparison of the measured flux with the total predicted flux .",
    "so for the purpose of distinguishing models with different survival probabilities , the best sensitivity lies in the observation of the solar flux component with the smallest error .",
    "above the threshold of liquid scintillator electron scattering experiments , the component with the most accurate prediction is the monoenergetic ( 1.442 mev ) source of pep neutrinos .",
    "the pep flux also has the smallest spread in the predictions from the main solar models , which allows its measurement to be sensitive to neutrino physics without needing to choose a particular solar model .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in section * [ sec:2 ] * we briefly review the rsfp model and its motivations , and compare its predictions with standard lma for the existing chlorine experiment data , in the context of the two ssms . in section * [ sec : sno ] * we briefly describe the sno+ experiment . in sec . *",
    "[ sec : rates ] * we describe the method and present our results . in section * [ sec : analysispep ] * we comment on the sensitivity of the pep measurement to an rsfp effect and we investigate the possibility for sno+ to distinguish between ssms of the two types with the cno measurement in sec . * [ sec : analysiscno]*. finally in section * [ sec : conclusions ] * we report our conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the rsfp effect from active to light sterile neutrinos and evaluate the survival probability for lma and lma+rsfp ( non - vanishing @xmath14 with low and high solar magnetic field ) .",
    "we start with a brief review of the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite whose predictions for borexino and lens were analyzed in @xcite and for kamland in @xcite .",
    "we also evaluate the event rates in the chlorine experiment for standard neutrinos ( i.e. massless and with no magnetic moment ) , for the lma and lma+rsfp scenario and for standard lma ( vanishing @xmath14 ) .",
    "we use the neutrino fluxes from the type i @xcite and ii @xcite solar models .",
    "the possible anticorrelation with sunspot activity of the electron neutrino flux in the ga experiments is most naturally explained in terms of a resonant conversion to neutrinos of other types that are unseen by the weak charged current . as shall be discussed",
    ", this requires a mass square difference between the intervening neutrino flavours in the resonance @xmath15 .",
    "such a value implies that conversion to weakly interacting neutrinos is excluded , leaving us the possibility of conversion to sterile neutrinos . the simplest departure from conventional lma able to generate such a conversion",
    "is provided by a model which , in addition to the two flavours involved in lma , introduces a sterile neutrino with a vanishing vacuum mixing .",
    "the active states @xmath16 communicate to the sterile one via a single magnetic moment .",
    "owing to the large order of magnitude difference between the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath1 ( associated with the lma and sfp resonances respectively ) the two resonances are located far apart , so that they do not interfere .",
    "a straightforward but long calculation leads to the following form of the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath18 in the mass matter basis @xmath19 . in this equation @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 are the matter induced potentials for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the solar magnetic field and @xmath25 is the vacuum mixing angle .    the important transition with order parameter @xmath10 and whose time dependent efficiency may determine the possible modulation of neutrino flux is therefore between mass matter eigenstates @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "it is expected to resonate in the region where the magnetic field is the strongest in the period of high solar activity .",
    "we consider the landau zener approximation in dealing with the two resonances .",
    "since the lma one is strongly adiabatic , we need only to consider the jump probability between @xmath26 , @xmath27 in the vicinity of the sfp resonance . in the lma+rsfp scenario",
    "active neutrinos are partially converted to light sterile ones at times of strong solar magnetic field , thus leading to the lower gallium event rate in the period 1998 - 2003 @xcite , while lma acts alone otherwise and the higher rate is obtained . as in previous publications , throughout our rsfp calculations we use a value for the neutrino magnetic moment @xmath28 . for a definite neutrino energy the critical density is fixed by the order of magnitude of the corresponding mass squared difference and determines the resonance range .",
    "furthermore it has been noticed @xcite that the solar rotation frequency matches the observed neutrino modulation in the equatorial section of the convection zone near the tachocline , at @xmath29 .",
    "this indicates a field profile whose time dependent peak occurs around this depth . in order that the low and intermediate energy neutrino sfp resonance is located in this range ,",
    "so as to provide time modulation in this sector , one needs @xmath30 .",
    "hence , owing to the absence of interference between the two resonances ( lma and rsfp ) the high energy solar neutrino experiments ( superkamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite ) are not expected to exhibit any time modulation in their event rate . on the contrary , of all the experiments",
    "so far , gallium will be the most sensitive of all to variability , while chlorine may lie in the borderline with some moderate variability which failed to be clearly detected .",
    "based on the above criteria we chose solar field profiles as in fig.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in our previous publications",
    "@xcite we performed two separate fits for the high and low gallium event rates together with all other solar neutrino data .",
    "we also investigated the dependence of the results on the choice of solar field profile and on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we will in the present paper use our best choices from ref .",
    "@xcite , namely        for the field profile and @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the peak field value , which for active sun we take to be @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the fraction of the solar radius and @xmath37",
    ".    furthermore we use @xcite @xmath38 which lie within @xmath39 of the central values for kamland@xcite . the field profile chosen , together with the value of @xmath1 ,",
    "will be responsible for a modulation shared by @xmath40 and @xmath13 neutrinos and a dip at the low and intermediate energy in the survival probability .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : survprob ] .",
    ".predicted total fluxes ( @xmath41 ) and expected event rates ( @xmath42 ) in the chlorine experiment for standard neutrinos .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "one of the key questions that the sno+ experiment will be able to address is the distinction between the two classes of ssms , type i and ii . moreover sno+ has the potential to distinguish the important issue of variability of the solar neutrino flux for low and intermediate energies . in order to investigate the prospects for the ssm distinction we looked for an event rate prediction",
    "whose model dependence leads to two well separated answers . the @xmath43b total flux measured by sno stands in between the ssm predictions and",
    "so can not resolve the ambiguity .",
    "furthermore the chlorine data can also not provide a clear distinction between the two models , the main reason being that the chlorine data combine several intermediate and high energy fluxes ( @xmath44be , cno and @xmath43b ) .",
    "in fact for ssm  i , while the lma+rsfp prediction is fully compatible with the data , the standard lma one is disfavoured at 1.3@xmath4 . on the other hand for ssm  ii both scenarios ( lma and lma+rsfp ) are equally consistent with experimental evidence .",
    "sno+ will be able to accurately measure the pep and cno fluxes .",
    "the former , largely independent of solar models , will supply the survival probability at low energies , essential to distinguish standard lma from lma+rsfp .",
    "consequently sno+ will be able to severely constrain the rsfp interpretation , thus strongly favouring lma or vice - versa .",
    "the cno measurement will on the other hand favour one ssm with respect to the other .",
    "thus four cases can be classified according to whether lma+rsfp or standard lma is favoured by the pep measurement and ssm  i or ssm  ii is favoured by the cno one .",
    "we have seen that , if @xmath1 is close to @xmath45 , the value corresponding to the most efficient resonances , sno+ will not only be able to discriminate standard lma from lma+rsfp after three years of data taking , but might also discriminate ssm  ii from ssm  i.    would the rsfp explanation be ruled out - or severely constrained - by the pep measurement , and the lma interpretation favoured , the chlorine results favour the ssm  ii solar model , with low heavy element abundance .",
    "the cno results could then be used to further confirm the consistency of the model .",
    "if , on the other hand , rsfp is favoured by the sno+ pep - data , cno can then be used to identify the right solar model ",
    "indistinguishable from chlorine and high energy neutrino flux data alone . for the rsfp case considered ,",
    "if the ssm  i prediction for cno fluxes is found , the ssm  ii model can be excluded at 3.5@xmath4 .",
    "although it will be harder to discriminate ssm  i from ssm  ii , the allowed regions of ssm  i could be severely constrained . in any case ,",
    "other measurements of low energy solar neutrino rates could complement the identification of the solar model and be used to test its consistency , and the consistency of the favoured oscillation pattern .",
    "in particular , consistency between the future pep and cno measurements at sno+ and the chlorine experiment requires that sno+ will either favour an lma+rsfp scenario or indicate a preference for a low cno flux prediction ( as in ssm  ii ) .",
