    "the value of @xmath132 requires the magnetic field strength to be @xmath133 from equation ( [ eq_break - frequency ] ) .",
    "however , the current magnetic field of @xmath133 seems unlikely because the observed @xmath0-rays to x - rays flux ratio would demands the local isrf energy density around g21.5 - 0.9 to be much smaller than the contribution from the cmb .",
    "note that it is hard to reproduce the observed sharp spectral break at @xmath131 , even if the magnetic field strength is @xmath133 .",

    "however , @xmath23 for @xmath319 is only a factor of 1.4 larger than that for @xmath32 with fixed @xmath173 , which we can almost independently determine from the observed power of the ic / isrf .",
    "we also search for correlations between the parameters of the injection spectrum and the pulsar parameters .",
    "the pulsar parameters include the spin - down power @xmath322 , the surface dipole magnetic field @xmath316 , the potential difference at the polar cap @xmath323 and the light cylinder magnetic field @xmath324 , where @xmath325 is the current angular velocity of the pulsar . in the left panel of figure",
    "[ eta - max ] , we plot the correlation between the fraction parameter @xmath10 versus the light cylinder magnetic field @xmath326 .",
    "although it seems to show some correlation , when we ignore kes 75 , the correlation is insignificant and the values of @xmath10 for the other objects spread only in a range @xmath327  @xmath328 . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ eta - max ] , we plot the correlation between the maximum energy @xmath40 versus the potential difference at the polar cap @xmath329 . because @xmath330 gives the maximum available electric energy of the pulsar to accelerate particle , this correlation",
    "is expected as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "however , we do not find a significant correlation .",
    "this may be partly because only an upper limit of @xmath40 is obtained , except for the crab nebula .",
    "for other combinations of the parameters , we do not find any significant correlations and we do not show them here .",
    "lastly , we discuss about the age @xmath29 and the expansion velocity @xmath81 of pwne . our spectral evolution model can estimate the age of the central pulsar in a fairly reliable way from the observed power of the ic / isrf .",
    "in contrast , the characteristic age @xmath30 of a pulsar is not guaranteed to match the age of young pulsars , when the spin - down time @xmath15 is close to the age of the pulsar @xmath29 as seen in equation ( [ eq_age_tc_t0 ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath30 of the central pulsars inside the crab nebula and g21.5 - 0.9 are 1.2kyr and 4.8kyr , but @xmath29 fitted with our model and the ages estimated from the observed expansion rate of the synchrotron nebula are both @xmath331 1.0kyr .",
    "we discuss about the properties of the sn explosion which creates the pulsars with obtained @xmath81 and @xmath22 .",
    "simply , we expect the relation @xmath332 , where @xmath333 is the energy of sn ejecta and @xmath334 is the velocity of the front of the freely expanding ejecta .",
    "we derive this relation from the radius of pwne @xmath77 in a freely expanding sn ejecta estimated as @xmath335 by @xcite .",
    "we do not find the relation @xmath336 , which suggests that the values of @xmath333 and @xmath334 are not common to the pwne . on the other hand , because the derived values of @xmath81 and @xmath337 differ by a factor of a few , the combination of @xmath338 also ranges within a factor of a few .      in this paper",
    ", we apply our spectral evolution model to four young tev pwne , g21.5 - 0.9 , g54.1 + 0.3 , kes 75 , and g0.9 + 0.1 .",
    "we have succeeded in reproducing many observed properties of these pwne based on this rather simplified one - zone model .",
    "the current observed spectra of all four young tev pwne are reconstructed with small values of the fraction parameter @xmath339 as well as the crab nebula , i.e. , the magnetic energy of these pwne accounts for a very small fraction of the current total energy injected into the pwn @xmath173 .",
    "the fitted fraction parameters are typically a few @xmath1 except for kes 75 .",
    "the fraction parameter of the peculiar object kes 75 is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical value .",
    "the tev @xmath0-ray emission from the young tev pwne is dominated by ic / isrf .",
    "since the energy density of the local isrf around the objects is somewhat uncertain , it is important to take into account its effect as considered in model 2 of g54.1 + 0.3 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath0-ray emission at early phase of their evolution ( e.g. , @xmath340 300yr ) is always ssc dominant because the magnetic energy density of the pwn is much larger than the local isrf energy density .    a broken power - law injection of particles well reproduces the observed spectrum from radio through tev @xmath0-ray , except the case of g0.9 + 0.1 where we do not need the low energy component .",
    "the observed spectrum of g0.9 + 0.1 in radio is created by the adiabatic cooling of the high energy component of the injected particles .",
    "the fitted break energy @xmath274 is rather common . on the other hand ,",
    "the fitted maximum energy @xmath40 is a lower limit ( more than @xmath341 ) and the fitted minimum energy @xmath38 is an upper limit ( less than @xmath342 ) .",
    "the high energy power - law index at injection @xmath284 is common for all young tev pwne , while the low energy power - law index at injection @xmath78 varies in the range @xmath285 .    the fitted parameters of the injection spectrum in equation ( [ eq_injection ] ) gives a lower limit of the pair multiplicity @xmath3 , which turns out to be more than @xmath2 .",
    "we have also estimated an upper limit of the bulk lorentz factor of the pulsar wind @xmath275 . for g21.5 - 0.9 and g54.1",
    "+ 0.3 , the upper limit of @xmath275 is still consistent with @xmath39 , but the obtained @xmath275 of kes 75 is clearly less than @xmath39 .",
    "the latter feature is the same as for the crab nebula in our previous work @xmath343 . on the other hand , for g0.9 + 0.1",
    ", the value of @xmath275 is similar to @xmath39 without uncertainty in our model .    from the fitted age",
    ", we can derive the initial spin - down luminosity and the spin - down time of the central pulsar .",
    "we take the initial rotational energy @xmath23 and the magnetic energy @xmath318 of the pulsar as two independent parameters which characterize the spin - down evolution of the pulsar and search for a correlation between them .",
    "they seem to be anticorrelated , although the statistics is rather poor .",
    "we also search for correlations between the fraction parameter and the parameters of the injection spectrum versus the central pulsar properties .",
    "however , we find no significant correlations .",
    "we are grateful to y. ohira for useful discussions .",
