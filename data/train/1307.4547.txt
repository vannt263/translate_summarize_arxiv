    "a quarter of a century after bose and einstein s 1924 - 1925 prediction @xcite that a free gas of bose particles would condense at low temperature to a coherent state , bogoliubov developed a first theory of weakly interacting bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in 1947 @xcite .",
    "it was an inspiring paper for many similar condensation phenomena , such as superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "the experimental study of a bec had to wait until 1995 . only then",
    "were cooling and trapping techniques sufficiently well developed to prepare large enough samples of such gases to observe their physical properties .",
    "presently these supply us with important systems on which we can test the theoretical tools developed in many - body physics and quantum field theory .    as an important result",
    "it was found that a nonlinear schrdinger equation , which in this context is known as gross - pitaevskii equation , yields satisfactory descriptions of such condensed states if the temperature is sufficiently low @xcite .",
    "this is possible due to the high dilution of the condensates which ensures the weakness of the interaction of the particles .",
    "more recently , however , it has been possible to increase the interaction strength of these gases so much that in spite of the high dilution , the interactions can be considered as strong .",
    "the way to do is to exploit the so - called feshbach resonance in the two - body potential .",
    "there exists a magnetic field @xmath0 where the scattering length of the two - body potential grows to infinity @xcite . in that regime ,",
    "the bogoliubov theory is no longer applicable , and the quantum field theory of the bose gas becomes completely nontrivial and therefore interesting .",
    "if we want to carry quantum field theoretical calculations from the well understood weak - coupling regime to strong couplings , we may resort to various procedures .",
    "one is , of course , the numerical simulation of the partition function of the system on a computer .",
    "this may yield numerical date with can be compared with experiments . a more satisfactory understanding",
    "can , however , be reached by analytic methods . if the action of the systems is formulated on a lattice , there are high - temperature and low - temperature expansions .",
    "the critical regime between them remains , however , hard to reach since both expansions diverge where they are supposed to meet .",
    "the problem is that one needs in principle infinitely many orders to reach a critical point .    in the past twenty years",
    ", methods have been developed to use weak - coupling expansions and resumming them in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "this is known as the renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "if the field theory is formulated in the continuum , the weak - coupling expansions require the calculation of feynman diagrams .",
    "the critical point lies at an infinite coherence length which corresponds to a zero mass of the euclidean field theory . at that point , many feynman diagrams diverge .",
    "if we want to study the limiting theory , we must renormalize the theory . for this",
    "we introduce an arbitrary mass scale @xmath1 , and for each @xmath1 we calculate a renormalized coupling strength @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting expansions in powers of @xmath2 are all divergent with a vanishing radius of convergence .",
    "they need sophisticated mathematical methods of resummation .",
    "there exists a a _ renormalization group function _",
    "@xmath3 which controls the change of the renormalized coupling constant under a change of the renormalization scale @xmath1 @xcite",
    ". if this function has a fixed point @xmath4 in the infrared limit @xmath5 , then the resummed series yield reasonable estimates for the critical behavior of a theory .",
    "the general form of the physical laws in this limit have been formulated by many authors @xcite .",
    "a much simpler and yet most powerful method has been developed in the textbook @xcite .",
    "again , the basic input consists in the diagrammatic expansions of the amplitudes , but here expressed directly in powers of the _ un_renormalized or _",
    "bare _ coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "these expansions are subjected to a variational procedure @xcite that converts the divergent weak - coupling power series into convergent strong - coupling power series @xcite .",
    "their expansion parameter is a certain inverse power of the coupling constant , @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is the so - called exponent governing the approach to scaling , introduced by wegner in 1990 @xcite .",
    "the new method is called _ variational perturbation theory _ ( vpt ) .",
    "if applied to quantum mechanics it reproduces the same results as the old - fashioned @xmath9-expansion @xcite . in quantum field theory",
    ", however , there are anomalous power laws , which can not be handled by the @xmath9-expansion , and the full vpt is essential .",
    "it has so far given the most accurate critical exponents measured by precision experiments in micro - gravity satellite environment @xcite .",
    "for various physical quantities and critical exponents , the critical expressions and the approach to the critical limit have been given in the textbook @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to extend the method to the calculation of effective actions . from perturbation",
    "theory it is well known how to calculate the effective action as a power series in the field strength , to be called @xmath10 .",
    "this expansion is valid as long as @xmath10 remains small . for large field strength ,",
    "however , the effective action exhibits a nontrivial power behavior which is approached in a way controlled again by the wegner exponent @xmath8 .",
    "we shall present a method for finding a global expression the effective action as a function of of any @xmath10 .",
    "it has for small @xmath10 the correct power series , and for large @xmath10 the correct power behavior , with the proper approach to the scaling limit .",
