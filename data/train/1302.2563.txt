    "temporal motifs are defined as equivalence classes of connected event sets @xcite . to explain this in more detail , consider a temporal network @xmath0 where the events @xmath1 represent interactions between the nodes @xmath2 ( figure [ fig : introfigure]a ) .",
    "an event @xmath3 from node @xmath4 to @xmath5 starts at time @xmath6 and has duration @xmath7  . in this article",
    "we also presume that the temporal network is _ colored _ : there is a mapping @xmath8 from nodes to the set of possible colors @xmath9 .",
    "colors can be used to distinguish different node types .    given a time window @xmath10 ,",
    "two events are @xmath10-_adjacent _ if they share at least one node and the time difference between them is no longer than @xmath10 . with adjacency",
    "we can define connectivity : two events are @xmath10-_connected _ if there exists a sequence of @xmath10-adjacent events between them .",
    "temporal subgraph _ can now be defined as a set of events where any two events are @xmath10-connected .",
    "if the events in this set are also consecutive for each node , the temporal subgraph is  _ valid_. events that all take place within @xmath10 .",
    "this out - star contains @xmath11 temporal subgraphs with @xmath12 events , but only @xmath13 _ valid _ temporal subgraphs .",
    "the same problem is also encountered with static motifs but in that case no equally natural solution is available @xcite . ]    finally , a _ temporal motif _",
    "@xmath14 is an equivalence class of valid temporal subgraphs ; two subgraphs are considered equivalent if their underlying colored graphs are isomorphic and their events occur in the same order ( figure [ fig : introfigure]b ) .",
    "given a temporal network , _ motif count _ @xmath15 is the number of valid temporal subgraphs in equivalence class @xmath14 ; the algorithms given in @xcite allow calculating @xmath15 for small motifs in colored temporal networks with up to @xmath16 events .",
    "from now on we will simply use the term _ motif _ to refer to colored temporal motifs .",
    "just as with static motifs , the motif counts alone are not very informative : with nothing to compare with it is difficult to say whether a given count is high or low . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : null_model ] we describe how to construct a null model to calculate reference count @xmath17 that corresponds to _ the count of motif @xmath14 under the null hypothesis that motif counts do not depend on node types , given the structure of the weighted aggregate network_. conditioning on the aggregate network is crucial : it means that any difference observed between @xmath15 and @xmath17 can not be explained by differences in the number of nodes of each type , activity of node types , or preferred connectivity patterns .",
    "the results obtained by comparing against this null model are purely temporal : they are independent of anything observable in the aggregate network .",
    "to illustrate what this null model can reveal we first apply it to synthetic data where we know exactly what there is to find .",
    "the synthetic data has two types of nodes , red and blue , with events occurring in such a fashion that those causal chains are more common where the first event takes place between nodes of the same color ( see appendix [ appendix : synthetic_data ] for details ) .",
    "the weighted aggregate network , however , has no structure . in particular",
    ", it is impossible to discern _ any _ difference between red and blue nodes in the aggregate network .    in the following we analyze the temporal patterns using all two - event motifs ( figure [ fig : introfigure]c ) . to identify whether the null hypothesis is true ",
    "that there are no differences between node types given the aggregate network ",
    "we calculate the @xmath18-score @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean and standard deviation of the count in the null model .",
    "if the null hypothesis is true , @xmath18-scores are expected to have zero mean and unit variance .",
    "as expected , figure [ fig : synthetic ] shows that for the synthetic data this is not the case .",
    "while the @xmath18-score is useful for evaluating whether the null hypothesis is true or not , it does not directly reveal effect size . instead of @xmath18-score , we present results using the ratio @xmath22 . because @xmath17 is the motif count under the null hypothesis that node types have no effect ,",
    "the ratio @xmath23 reveals how much more or less common a motif is because of node types . in the synthetic data",
    "the overrepresented causal motifs have @xmath24 , that is , they are 18 % more common than expected if there were no difference between node types .",
    "-scores for all two - event motifs in the synthetic data , averaged over 50 data sets . for most motifs @xmath25 because there are no differences between node colors .",
    "the peak at @xmath26 corresponds to the four causal chains where the first event occurs between nodes of the same color . because expected motif count is defined by the average count of uncolored motifs",
    ", the peak at @xmath27 contains the four remaining causal chains where the first event occurs between nodes of different color . ]",
    "we now turn to study a mobile phone data set that contains 600 million calls during a period of 6 months between 6.3 million anonymized customers ( see appendix [ appendix : data ] ) . as the data includes information on the time and duration of calls it can be represented as a temporal network .",
    "node types are formed by combining the gender , age group , and payment type ( prepaid or postpaid mobile subscription plan ) of customers .",
    "our analysis focuses on two - event motifs for simplicity ( figure [ fig : introfigure]c ) .",
    "larger motifs are not only more demanding computationally , but also more laborious to analyze : there are already @xmath28 different two - event motifs with the 24 node types created by combining gender , age group , and payment type .",
    "we first check whether the null hypothesis is true or false  whether node types affect motifs counts beyond what can be expected based on the aggregate network  by plotting the distribution of @xmath18-scores , shown in figure [ fig : zscore_dist]a .",
    "the distribution does not have zero mean or unit variance ; instead , about 35% of motifs have @xmath29 .",
    "the null hypothesis is clearly false , and we can conclude that motif counts are not independent of node types .",
    "for comparison , figure [ fig : zscore_dist]b shows the same distribution after shuffling node types , and figure [ fig : zscore_dist]c after shuffling event types ( see appendix [ appendix : shuffling ] ) . in both cases",
    "the distributions suggest that the null hypothesis is true . indeed , after randomizing node types there can be no differences between them even though the data still contains the same _ untyped _ temporal subgraphs as the original data .",
    "the time shuffled data , on the other hand , has exactly the same aggregate network as the original data .",
    "however , because event times are now uncorrelated , all differences between node types are explained by the structure of the aggregate network .",
    "figure [ fig : zscore_dist]a shows that there are differences between node types ; we will now look at what these differences are .",
    "_ homophily _ refers to the well - documented tendency of individuals to interact with others similar to them with respect to various social and demographic factors @xcite .",
    "since social networks act as conduits of information , homophily limits the information that individuals can receive .",
    "here we investigate whether homophily also manifests at the level of contact sequences , _",
    "i.e. _ whether there is _ temporal homophily _ , a tendency of similar individuals to jointly participate in interaction patterns _ beyond the homophily observed in the aggregate network_.    to this end we calculate the average @xmath23 of two - event motifs where all nodes have the same age group , gender , or payment type , or agree for all of these attributes .",
    "this average is then compared to the average @xmath23 of all other motifs .",
    "the results are presented in table [ table : homophily ] . for motifs involving only two individuals ,",
    "the only statistically significant difference is an under - expression of the returned call motif for participants of the same payment type ; detailed analysis ( see si ) reveals that this is because of frequent patterns where a prepaid customer calls a postpaid customer , who then immediately calls back .",
    "more complex motifs  chains and stars  exhibit more evidence of temporal homophily .",
    "those motifs where all participants are similar with respect to all three attributes are significantly more common .",
    "star motifs are more common also when the participants agree with respect to only one attribute .",
    "the strongest effect is observed for similarity in payment type ; it is , however , likely that the payment type correlates with various socioeconomic factors .",
    "results for text messages are qualitatively similar ( see si )",
    ".        table [ tablesi : homophily_type_calls ] reveals that repeated calls are significantly more common between prepaid users .",
    "figure [ fig : most_common_m1 - 1 - 1 - 1_calls ] shows also that if a postpaid user is involved , the receiver is typically still prepaid ; the most common case where both are postpaid has @xmath30 .",
    "there is very little homophily with respect to gender or age .",
    "sms shown in figure [ fig : most_common_m1 - 1 - 1 - 1_sms ] have a similar pattern , but the effect is much weaker .",
    "figure [ fig : most_common_m1 - 2 - 1 - 1_calls ] reveals a particularly strong regularity for returned calls : the most common motifs are those in which the first caller is prepaid and the second is postpaid .",
    "this shows up as heterophily by payment type in table [ tablesi : homophily_calls ] .",
    "a plausible  if not exciting  explanation is that prepaid plans are generally more expensive and calling time is limited .",
    "the most surprising thing about the results on non - causal and causal chains ( figures [ fig : most_common_m2 - 1 - 1 - 1_calls ] and [ fig : most_common_m2 - 1 - 1 - 2_calls ] ) is that they are so similar .",
    "both are more common for postpaid users and females .",
    "as shown in table [ tablesi : homophily_sms ] , for sms there is homophily by gender but in - homophily by payment type .",
    "out - stars for calls shown in figure [ fig : most_common_m2 - 2 - 1 - 1_calls ] have the highest ratio scores of all motifs .",
    "there is strong homophily with respect to all attributes .",
    "all - female out - stars are common for both calls and sms , while only the sms out - star is overrepresented for males .. figure [ fig : most_common_m2 - 2 - 1 - 1_calls ] also reveals a surprising homophily with respect to age : those cases where the two receives have similar age are most common .",
    "figure [ fig : most_common_m2 - 3 - 1 - 1_calls ] shows that for calls in - stars are more common when the receiver is prepaid and the two callers postpaid .",
    "there is some homophily by the age of the two callers , but this does not appear to be as strong as for out - stars .",
    "figures [ fig : most_common_m1 - 1 - 1 - 1_calls_comm ] through [ fig : most_common_m2 - 3 - 1 - 1_calls_comm ] show the most common 2-event motifs when events are separated into two categories by local density .",
    "the green edges denote events on dense edges ( inside a 4-clique community ) and red edges all other events .",
    "results have been calculated separately for six consecutive months , and the ratio shown below each motif is the median over all months .",
    "the node type is a combination of gender ( red for female , blue for male ) and payment type ( open for postpaid , filled for prepaid ) ; age categories are not used in order to limit the number of different motifs . because of the null hypothesis used , comparison of @xmath23 is valid only between motifs that have the same node types and _ differ only in event types_.    the results for different motif types are surprisingly consistent .",
    "for the two motifs with only one edge , repeated calls in figure [ fig : most_common_m1 - 1 - 1 - 1_calls_comm ] and returned calls in figure [ fig : most_common_m1 - 2 - 1 - 1_calls_comm ] , the motifs with sparse edge are more common .",
    "the exact opposite is true for all motifs that take place on two edges ( figures [ fig : most_common_m2 - 1 - 1 - 1_calls_comm][fig : most_common_m2 - 3 - 1 - 1_calls_comm ] ) : these motifs are more common on dense edges .",
    "as discussed in main text , one possible explanation is that the local network density directly affects motif counts .",
    "after all , in order to construct the null model we approximate that the number of motifs at any location does not depend on neighboring edges .",
    "however , if this were true , we would expect those motifs that have one dense and one sparse event to fall between the two extremes ; this is however not the case . for all motifs with two edges , the most common motifs are those where both events are dense , the second those where both are sparse , and the least common are those where one edge is dense and the other is sparse .",
    "note that these results are to a large extent independent from those shown in figures [ fig : most_common_m1 - 1 - 1 - 1_calls][fig : most_common_m2 - 3 - 1 - 1_sms ] that only consider node types .",
    "for example , we saw above that returned contact is more common when the first caller is prepaid and the second postpaid .",
    "looking at this pattern in figure [ fig : most_common_m1 - 2 - 1 - 1_calls_comm ] for example between prepaid female and postpaid female user , we have @xmath31 for sparse edges ( 1st row , 3rd from right ) and @xmath32 for dense edges ( 3rd row , at right ) . combining this result with those presented earlier , we find that the returned contact between prepaid female and postpaid female is more common than with other combinations of node types ( figure [ fig : most_common_m1 - 2 - 1 - 1_calls ] ) , and more common on sparse than dense edges ( figure [ fig : most_common_m1 - 2 - 1 - 1_calls_comm ] ) ."
