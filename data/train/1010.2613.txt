    "the structure of the neutron rich odd - a gallium isotopes ( @xmath13 ) has been studied in the past by means of @xmath14 decay  @xcite , single and multi - particle transfer reactions  @xcite and more recently by deep inelastic reactions  @xcite .",
    "the two neutron transfer reaction data suggest a change in structure between @xmath15ga@xmath2 and @xmath16ga@xmath17 , which is most probably related to the structural difference observed between @xmath18ge@xmath2 and @xmath19ge@xmath4 ( @xmath20 ) , where both the @xmath18ge@xmath2(t , p)@xmath19ge@xmath17 and @xmath19ge@xmath17(p , t)@xmath18ge@xmath2 reactions strongly populate the excited @xmath21 state , indicating a shape transition  @xcite .",
    "the two neutron transfer reaction @xmath15ga@xmath2(t , p)@xmath16ga@xmath17 indicated indeed a similar shift of the @xmath22 strength as it is almost equally divided over three 3/2@xmath23 states at energies of 0 , 219 and 915 kev  @xcite .",
    "recently a collinear laser spectroscopy measurement confirmed the assumption of a 3/2@xmath23 ground state in all odd - a gallium isotopes , except for @xmath16ga@xmath17 and @xmath24ga@xmath25 where the spin and parity of the ground states were found to be 1/2@xmath23 and 5/2@xmath23 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "a combination of the results from previous experiments opens the possibility of a 1/2@xmath26 , 3/2@xmath26 ground state doublet in @xmath16ga .",
    "the existence of such a doublet is compatible with the available transfer reaction data as the population of the yrast @xmath11 state is weak compared to the @xmath27 ground state in similar experiments studying @xmath28ga  @xcite .    from the energy systematics , there seems to be a more general structural difference between the odd - a gallium isotopes up to @xmath29ga@xmath30 and those with 40 neutrons or more ( see figure  [ fig : systematics ] ) .",
    "the level structure at low excitation energy of the former is characterized by 2 groups of levels : one consists of the 3/2@xmath23 ground state along with a 1/2@xmath23 and 5/2@xmath23 level at low excitation energy , which are all strongly populated in one proton transfer reactions on zinc isotopes , suggesting a @xmath31 single - particle character  @xcite .",
    "the second group of levels comprises a 1/2@xmath23,3/2@xmath23,5/2@xmath23 and 7/2@xmath23 multiplet , situated around an energy of 1 mev and can originate mainly from the @xmath322@xmath33(zn ) core - coupling scheme .",
    "the average excitation energy of the members of this multiplet agrees very well with the energy of the @xmath34 state in the corresponding zinc isotopes .",
    "measured @xmath35-values for ground state transitions from members of this multiplet in these isotopes are similar in magnitude to b(e2;@xmath36)-values in the corresponding zinc core supporting this assignment as the dominant component of the wave function  @xcite .",
    "state in the zinc isotopes is shown in green .",
    "data taken from  @xcite , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in @xmath15ga@xmath2 the separation between these two groups of levels is less obvious . also note from figure  [ fig : systematics ] that the @xmath37 level reaches a minimum in excitation energy for @xmath10 .",
    "calculations within the coriolis coupling model including the pairing interaction reproduce this minimum  @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this trend is that increased deformation in the @xmath38 mid - shell region brings the @xmath39 orbital down in energy  @xcite .    in order to get a better understanding of the structural changes in the gallium isotopes between @xmath40 and @xmath41 and to find evidence for the proposed ground state doublet",
    ", a coulomb excitation experiment was performed using post - accelerated beams of @xmath5ga  @xcite .",
    "the radioactive @xmath5ga ion beam were produced at the rex - isolde facility in cern by irradiating a 45 g/@xmath42 uc@xmath43 target with a 1.4 gev pulsed proton beam with an intensity of @xmath44 protons / pulse ( 18 pulses / minute ) .",
    "the primary target matrix was kept at a temperature of approximately 2000 @xmath45c to optimize the release time of the ions from the source .",
    "the gallium atoms were surface ionized in a hot cavity and were extracted from the source by applying a 30 kv extraction potential . beside surface ionization of gallium atoms also",
    "copper atoms were selectively ionized by resonant laser ionization as the coulomb excitation of neutron - rich copper isotopes was one of the topics of interest  @xcite .",
    "after mass separation the ions of interest were bunched by rex - trap , charge bred in rex - ebis to a charge state of @xmath46 , post - accelerated to an energy of 2.95 mev / nucleon by the rex linear accelerator  @xcite and finally directed on a 1.7 mg/@xmath47 @xmath8sn or a 2 mg/@xmath47 @xmath48pd target to induce coulomb excitation .",
    "de - exciting @xmath6 rays after coulomb excitation were detected by the miniball @xmath6-detector array which consists of eight clusters of three hpge crystals which are all electrically sixfold segmented  @xcite .",
    "the absolute photo peak efficiency of this detector array is 7.2 % at 1332 kev .",
    "a 500 @xmath49 m thick cd - shaped segmented double - sided silicon detector was placed 35 mm behind the target to register the scattered projectiles and recoiling target nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this detector is divided in four quadrants which have 16 angular rings in the front and 24 sector strips in the back , covering an angular range in the laboratory system between 16@xmath45 and 53@xmath45 .",
    "the beam composition was monitored by comparing laser on ( ga + cu ) with laser off ( only ga ) measurements on a regular basis . with lasers on , the average",
    "@xmath16ga - to - total ratio of the beam during the experiment was 82.6(6 ) % , with a @xmath16ga intensity at the miniball set - up of @xmath50 pps . for mass 71 the average @xmath15ga - to - total ratio was equal to 35(1 ) % with a @xmath15ga intensity of @xmath51 pps .",
    ".overview of information on @xmath52-values in the neutron - rich gallium isotopes , including the extracted @xmath52-values for @xmath15ga from this work and those reported in  @xcite .",
    "the large uncertainty on the presented @xmath52-values is due to the limited amount of statistics ( 93 @xmath53 25 counts ( 512 kev ) and 67 @xmath53 26 counts ( 965 kev ) ) . [",

    "data taken from ensdf  @xcite and this work.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in figure  [ fig:73ga_scheme ] the level structure of @xmath16ga is shown based on literature  @xcite and this work . considering recent laser spectroscopy data",
    "the ground state spin was found to be @xmath11 while transfer reactions gave evidence for a @xmath27 state close to the ground state .",
    "no evidence for a doublet near the ground state of @xmath16ga was obtained from the transfer reaction studies  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained from the analysis of the @xmath16ga coulomb excitation data support the existence of this doublet . from figure  [ fig : spectrumdc73].b it can be seen that the peak originating from the depopulation of the 199 kev state is doppler broadened .",
    "an excited state with an energy of 198(3 ) kev was observed previously in the one proton stripping reaction with @xmath54l = 3 , restricting its spin and parity to 5/2@xmath23,7/2@xmath23  @xcite . as this state",
    "is populated directly by coulomb excitation the spin can be firmly fixed as 5/2@xmath23 .",
    "a recent @xmath19ge(d,@xmath55he ) transfer reaction using polarized deuterons also favors a 5/2@xmath26 assignment for this state  @xcite .",
    "the observed doppler broadening imposes a restriction on the lifetime of this 5/2@xmath56 state .",
    "as the scattered particles are all stopped in the cd detector , the lifetime of this level should be considerably smaller than the 3.5 ns maximum time of flight between the @xmath8sn target and the cd detector .",
    "the lifetime of this 5/2@xmath57 state in case of a pure e2 decay to the 1/2@xmath23 ground state can be calculated to be 13(2 ) ns based on the experimental @xmath58-value found in table  [ tab : be2_73ga ] .",
    "the observed doppler broadening of the 199 kev peak can thus only be explained if it has an important , fast m1 component .",
    "note that the weisskopf estimate for the half - life of this 5/2@xmath57 state for a pure 199 kev m1 transition is 2.3 ps .",
    "we can thus conclude that there exists a state very close to the @xmath11 ground state in @xmath16ga with spin and parity ranging between @xmath27 and @xmath59 .",
    "the two - neutron transfer reaction indicates a @xmath60 character  @xcite thus the low lying state that forms a doublet with the @xmath11 state must have spin and parity @xmath27 .",
    "the inverse process has already been applied in a similar experiment to show that specific states have lifetimes in the range of nanoseconds , which was used to deduce the multipole character of the de - exciting @xmath6 ray .",
    "@xcite .",
    "also gamma rays de - exciting levels at 218 kev and 496 kev were observed and the deduced coulomb excitation cross sections are compatible with single - step coulomb excitation . from two - neutron transfer reaction data , the spin and parity of the 218 kev level",
    "are known to be 3/2@xmath26 .",
    "a state around 495 kev was observed in the @xmath19ge(d,@xmath55he ) reaction with @xmath54l = 3  @xcite , limiting the spin and parity of this state to 5/2@xmath23 or 7/2@xmath23 .",
    "data from the @xmath19ge(d,@xmath55he ) reaction using polarized deuterons favor a 7/2@xmath23 assignment for this state .",
    "the fact that we observe direct population of the 496 kev state via coulomb excitation from a 1/2@xmath26 ground state however limits the spin of this state to be 5/2@xmath26 .",
    "also the lack of @xmath6 feeding towards this state in the decay of the 9/2@xmath61 state , in contrast with the two 7/2@xmath26-states at 952 kev and 651 kev  @xcite , supports this 5/2@xmath23 assignment .",
    "however , the possibility of a 5/2@xmath23,7/2@xmath23 doublet around 495 kev can not be completely excluded .",
    "the energy difference between the two members of the ground state doublet was estimated by comparing @xmath6-ray energies of different decay paths of excited states that preferentially populate a different member of the doublet .",
    "a possible candidate is the decay of the 496 kev 5/2@xmath62 level assuming the @xmath6 decay branchings in @xmath16ga are similar to those in @xmath63ga . from the intensity ratios @xmath64 and @xmath65 in @xmath63ga",
    "it can be expected that the 496 kev transition in @xmath16ga will preferentially populate the 3/2@xmath23 member of the doublet by a m1 transition , while the cascade of 278 kev and 218 kev transitions primarily feeds the 1/2@xmath23 state  @xcite . in order to improve the precision of the @xmath6-ray energies used , available",
    "@xmath16zn @xmath14-decay data from the isolde tape station  @xcite were analyzed ( see figure  [ fig : prc_beta ] ) and included in the adopted values tabulated in table  [ tab:73gammas ] .",
    "the adopted @xmath6-ray energy of the direct decay is 496.07(12 ) kev ( see table  [ tab:73gammas ] ) , while the indirect branch consists of two @xmath6 rays with energies of 218.08(11 ) kev and 278.5(3 ) kev adding up to 496.5(4 ) kev .",
    "this results in an energy difference of 0.4(4 ) kev between the two decay paths .",
    "this imposes an upper limit on the excitation energy of the @xmath66 state of 0.8 kev within 1 @xmath67 .",
    "detailed analysis of the 218 kev peak shape ( figure  [ fig : prc_beta ] ) does not show any broadening of the peak , indicating that the transition is either mono - energetic or that the energy difference is too small to cause any peak asymmetry .",
    "also the population of a level with an energy of 1395.1(12 ) kev in @xmath16ga is observed .",
    "this level was observed before in the @xmath15ga(t , p)@xmath16ga reaction , with an energy of 1395(3 ) kev and @xmath68 angular momentum transfer , yielding spin and parity possibilities ranging from 5/2@xmath23 up to 11/2@xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the observed population of this 1395 kev level is compatible with single step coulomb excitation as a two step process would require unphysically large @xmath52-values between excited @xmath69 states and this 1395 kev state . in the case of two step coulomb excitation through the @xmath70 level",
    ", the required @xmath52-values would be @xmath71 = 17000 e@xmath72@xmath73 or @xmath74 = 8000 e@xmath72@xmath73 depending on the spin of the 1395 kev state .",
    "such @xmath52-values would lead to strong @xmath6-decay branches to excited @xmath75 states in comparison with the branch to the doublet near @xmath76 kev excitation energy .",
    "hence , the lack of strong @xmath6 branches to the excited @xmath27 and @xmath77 states also supports the interpretation in terms of single step coulomb excitation , constraining the spin and parity of this level to @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , a series of weaker transitions with energies of 433 , 452 and 651 kev is observed .",
    "these originate from the de - excitation of a level at 651.2 kev which was recently proposed with a spin and parity assignment of 7/2@xmath23  @xcite . as m3 excitations",
    "are strongly hindered during the coulomb excitation process , the population of this state by coulomb excitation from a 1/2@xmath23 ground state can only take place by a two step process .",
    "while the population of this level is governed by @xmath78 matrix elements , the decay is determined by both these @xmath79- and the @xmath80 matrix element . due to the high number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "@xmath79 matrix elements between @xmath69 states and this @xmath81 state can not be firmly fixed in our analysis .",
    "hence , @xmath82-values for the observed transitions are not included in table  [ tab : be2_73ga ] , while the influence of these transitions on the published @xmath52-values in table  [ tab : be2_73ga ] was extensively investigated and included in the error bars .    also the possible influence of multistep coulomb excitation via the @xmath66 level on the extracted @xmath52-values",

    "coincident with the 199 kev ( top ) and the 218 kev ( bottom ) transition .",
    "the 199 kev coincidence spectrum shows coincidences with both 298 kev and 452 kev transitions , while the 218 kev @xmath6 ray is coincident with 278 kev .",
    "no coincidence between the 218 kev and 433 kev @xmath6 rays is observed , which is due to the relatively small 433 kev @xmath6 branch in the decay of the 651 kev state  @xcite .",
    "based on the limited number of 452 - 199 kev coincidences observed the top spectrum less then one 433 - 218 kev coincidence count is expected in the lower spectrum.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    analysis of particle-@xmath6-@xmath6 events shows a new branch in the decay of the 496 kev 5/2@xmath62 level . the coincidence spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : coinc73 ] ) shows beside the known coincidence of the 218 kev and 278 kev transitions also a coincidence between the 199 kev and 298 kev transitions .",
    "the new transition with an energy of 298(2 ) kev can be inserted into the level scheme as the transition between the 496 kev 5/2@xmath62 and 199 kev 5/2@xmath56 levels with a branching ratio of 3(1)% relative to the 496 kev transition .",
