    "mostly the worm like chain model is used to describe the properties of dna in a good solvent .",
    "the theoretical and experimental force - extension relations are in good agreement at relatively low forces @xcite .",
    "when one applies a large force ( around @xmath0 pn ) on double stranded dna , one observes an abrupt increase of the contour length of the molecule @xcite .",
    "this marks a transition from the standard b - form of dna to a so called s - form of dna . in @xcite ,",
    "one performs stretching and releasing experiments on the same molecule under different solvent conditions .",
    "often the stretch and release curves do not coincide and hysteresis is observed .",
    "one can eliminate this hysteresis by increasing the salt concentration of the solvent .",
    "then one can assume that the experiment is performed under equilibrium conditions .",
    "the salt dependence of the overstretching transition is further studied in @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of this transition is studied in @xcite .    the reversible b - dna to s - dna transition",
    "is studied theoretically by different authors .",
    "typically the developed models contain several adjustable parameters .",
    "we will make a strict distinction between a posteriori ( called posteriors ) and a priori parameters ( called priors ) .",
    "the former have the usual meaning of parameters that are changed in order to obtain a good fit of a theoretical curve to an experimental dataset .",
    "the latter have the meaning that the values of the parameters can be considered as fixed and are not used in the fitting procedure . in an attempt to explain the obtained experimental data of the b - dna to s - dna transition , a pure two - state model is used in @xcite .",
    "the application of this model is limited to the transition region .",
    "for this reason , the model is combined in @xcite with the well known worm like chain model .",
    "the combination of the two models results in a good fit to the experimental data of @xcite with @xmath1 posteriors and @xmath2 priors .",
    "another theoretical model is introduced in @xcite .",
    "this so called discrete persistent chain model , combines features from the worm like chain model and the freely jointed chain model and contains @xmath3 posteriors ( although some of them could have been used as priors ) . as a consequence of the large number of parameters ,",
    "it is no surprise that a very good fit to one of the experimental datasets of @xcite is obtained . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors argue that one has to include salt effects to explain all the datasets of @xcite , obtained under different solvent conditions . starting from a phenomenological expression for the free energy ,",
    "the authors obtain theoretical curves that depend on @xmath4 posteriors and several priors .",
    "a good fit to @xmath3 different datasets of @xcite is obtained .",
    "the fit parameter that is the most sensitive to the salt concentration is the effective length of charge separation .",
    "the range of values of this parameter obtained by the fit to the @xmath3 datasets is in agreement with previous studies .",
    "the authors conclude that their ansatz for the free energy is physically meaningful .",
    "another molecule that is often studied in the literature is the protein titin .",

    "force - extension relation is measured .",
    "although the resulting curve is non - trivial , surprisingly one usually only studies in the literature @xcite the dynamic force - extension relation of this protein . in this paper we will develop a thermodynamic model that is based on the three - dimensional random walk , to describe the static force - extension relation of titin .    in @xcite",
    ", the present authors obtained analytical results for the one - dimensional persistent random walk with drift .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this walk can be used as a qualitative model for a polymer in solution . in the present paper",
    "we study the three - dimensional persistent random walk with drift",
    ". we will show that it can be used to study the force - extension relations of overstretched dna and of the protein titin .",
    "the persistent random walk is intensively studied in the literature @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that the persistent random walk is used to study the aforementioned force - extension relations .    in the next section our mathematical model",
    "is introduced .",
    "the section starts with a brief summary of the most important results of @xcite .",
    "the application of these results to the three - dimensional persistent random walk with drift then follows . in section [ the_mod ] , we establish the connection between the parameters of our mathematical model and the thermodynamic control parameters of interest . in sections [ sb_overgang ] and [ appl_tit ] , the applications of our formalism are studied .",
    "the last section gives a short discussion of the results .",
    "in @xcite markov chains with a finite number of states are studied .",
    "a markov chain with state space @xmath6 is determined by initial probabilities @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , and by transition probabilities @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , with @xmath11 the probabilities @xmath7 are used as initial values for the equation of motion @xmath12 they are called stationary if the following equation holds @xmath13 the record of transitions @xmath14 is defined @xcite as a sequence of numbers @xmath15 , one for each pair of states @xmath16 , counting how many times the transition from @xmath17 to @xmath18 is contained in a given path of the markov chain .",
    "one can prove following properties for stationary markov chains @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath20 the total number of chain elements , @xmath21 the standard boltzmann - gibbs entropy and @xmath22 an average over phase space .",
    "consider now a discrete , three - dimensional random walk with transition probabilities which depend only on the direction of the present and of the previous step .",
    "this means that the process of the increments is markovian .",
    "the state space of the latter process contains @xmath23 elements and is @xmath24 to clarify this notation , @xmath25 has the meaning of a step in the positive @xmath17-direction , while @xmath26 is a step in the negative @xmath17-direction .",
    "the markov chain is determined by @xmath27 different transition probabilities . to reduce this number",
    "we first assume that the walker can not turn back .",
    "this is equivalent with following constraints on the transition probabilities @xmath28 for the applications , studied in the present paper , it is important to break the symmetry in one of the spatial directions _ and _ to distinguish between steps that go straight on or change direction .",
    "so , to further reduce the number of transition probabilities we can assume that the states @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are equivalent .",
    "then define the following shorthand notation @xmath33    using the normalisation condition ( [ normpw ] ) one obtains following expressions for the remaining @xmath23 transition probabilities @xmath34 so now we are left with a @xmath35-parameter model .",
    "the stationary probabilities can be calculated by solving the set of equations ( [ stat_prob ] ) together with the normalisation condition ( [ normpw ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "then the average number of changes of direction @xmath38 and the entropy @xmath21 can be calculated with ( [ eig_random ] ) @xmath39 \\cr & & -p(x-)\\left[(1 - 4\\mu)\\ln(1 - 4\\mu)+4\\mu\\ln\\mu\\right ] \\cr   & & -4p(y+)\\big[(1-\\alpha-\\gamma-2\\theta)\\ln(1-\\alpha-\\gamma-2\\theta ) \\cr & & + \\alpha\\ln\\alpha+\\gamma\\ln\\gamma+2\\theta\\ln\\theta\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where finite size corrections are ignored in the expression for the entropy .",
    "we now introduce an extra asymmetry in the model .",
    "we use two different lattice parameters @xmath40 en @xmath41 .",
    "if the walker goes straight on , the length of the step is @xmath40 , if the walker changes direction , the length of the step is @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath17-component of the endposition of the walk is @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "the average of @xmath17 becomes @xmath44+\\frac bn4\\epsilon\\mu(\\alpha-\\gamma).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the averages of the @xmath18- and @xmath45-component of the endpostion of the walk vanish because of the imposed symmetry .",
    "in this section , we follow the lines of @xcite to obtain expressions for the thermodynamic control parameters of interest as a function of @xmath46 . in experiments",
    "one measures force - extension relations of biopolymers at constant temperature . to establish the connection between the random walk and the polymer , we interpret the endposition of the walk as the extension of the molecule .",
    "the corresponding control parameter is the force @xmath47 applied to the endpoint of the molecule .",
    "the hamiltonian is defined as @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the number of changes of direction and @xmath50 a constant with dimensions of energy .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath50 , the ground state of the system is a compact walk that always changes direction ( @xmath51 ) or a stretched walk that always goes straight on ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the reason why we define the hamiltonian like this will become clear in the following sections . the control parameter corresponding with the energy @xmath53 , is the temperature @xmath54 .",
    "the legendre transform of the entropy @xmath21 is the free energy @xmath55 @xmath56 explicit expressions for @xmath53 , @xmath57 and @xmath21 as a function of the model parameters are known , see ( [ ks ] ) and ( [ x ] ) . as a consequence , the solution of the set of equations @xmath58 can be obtained in closed form @xmath59&=&\\ln\\frac{\\epsilon}{1 - 4\\epsilon}\\frac \\alpha\\theta \\cr h\\beta&=&\\ln\\frac{1-\\alpha-\\gamma-2\\theta}\\theta , \\cr 2\\beta fb&=&\\ln\\frac\\epsilon\\mu\\frac\\alpha\\gamma \\cr 2\\beta fa&=&\\ln\\frac{1 - 4\\epsilon}{1 - 4\\mu } , \\cr ( 1-\\alpha-\\gamma-2\\theta)^2&=&(1 - 4\\epsilon)(1 - 4\\mu).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this set of equations can be inverted and has a unique physical solution for every value of @xmath60 and @xmath47 , see appendix [ app ]",
    ". then a plot of the average endposition of the walk as a function of the external force at constant temperature can be obtained , see figure [ fig : exte]a . when @xmath51 , the average endpostion increases in two steps at low temperatures .",
    "at high temperatures this multi - step behaviour disappears .",
    "it is useful to study the average number of changes of direction and the entropy as a function of the force to understand this non - trivial behaviour , see figures [ fig : exte]b and [ fig : exte]c .",
    "the steep increase of the average endposition at low forces is a result of the degeneracy of the ground state of the model .",
    "contrary to the one - dimensional case , the three - dimensional random walk has different compact configurations for which the number of changes of direction equals the total number of steps . at vanishing force",
    ", the system has no preference for any of these configurations which results in a vanishing average endposition and a high value of the entropy . at low force",
    ", the walk can lower its free energy by choosing the configuration with the largest extension without changing the number of changes of direction . as a consequence one observes an increase of @xmath57 , a decrease of @xmath21 , while @xmath38 remains approximately constant .",
    "the steep increase of the average endposition at intermediate force is also present in the one - dimensional random walk @xcite .",
    "it is the result of the competition between the folding energy @xmath61 and the potential energy @xmath62 . in @xcite ,",
    "this sudden change of the average endposition is used to define the gradual transition from compact to stretched state of the walk .",
    "the boundary line is obtained by calculating the peak value of @xmath63 at constant temperature . for the present model ,",
    "the same criterion is used .",
    "figure [ fig : phase ] shows the entropy as a function of force and temperature .",
    "the black solid line shows the boundary between the two phases and is obtained by a numerical calculation .",
    "an unexpected result is that the boundary line is an increasing function of the temperature at low temperatures .",
    "this is also observed in the one - dimensional persistent random walk @xcite and in self avoiding random walks @xcite and is a consequence of a subtle asymmetry in the entropy that favours the compact phase above the stretched phase .",
    "this asymmetry can be seen in figures [ fig : exte]c and [ fig : phase ] . at low temperatures ,",
    "the entropy is clearly not symmetric around @xmath64 .    in the appendix [ app2 ] an approximate expression for the boundary line at low temperatures",
    "is calculated , under the assumptions @xmath51 , @xmath65 .",
    "one obtains @xmath66 , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ fig : phase ] shows the result of the latter expression together with the exact boundary line .",
    "the two lines coincide up to a temperature of approximately @xmath69 .",
    "an approximate formula for the force - extension relation in the transition region ( @xmath70 ) is also derived in appendix [ app2 ] .",
    "the result of the latter expression and the exact force - extension relation is shown in figure [ fig : approx ] for different values of the parameter @xmath71 .",
    "clearly the approximation becomes better for higher values of @xmath72 .",
    "when one applies a large force on double stranded dna , one observes a transition from the standard b - form of dna ( with length per base pair of @xmath73 nm ) to a so called s - form of dna ( with length per base pair of @xmath74 nm ) .",
    "introduce @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the contour length of b - dna and s - dna respectively .",
    "then , divide the dna chain in short segments that are in the b - form or s - form . then define @xmath77 and @xmath78 as the number of segments and the total number of base pairs of the dna chain respectively .",
    "now we use the three - dimensional walk as a model for the dna chain . in our interpretation",
    ", changing direction during the walk corresponds with an b - segment of the dna chain , while going straight on during the walk corresponds with an s - segment .",
    "now it becomes clear why we defined the hamiltonian as @xmath48 with @xmath49 the number of changes of direction of the walk and @xmath50 a constant with dimensions of energy .",
    "when we chose the sign of @xmath50 negative , the ground state of the model is the desired standard b - form of dna .",
    "we introduced two different lattice parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 . if the walker changes direction , the length of the step is @xmath41 , if the walker goes straight on , the length of the step is @xmath40 . as a consequence ,",
    "the total number of steps of the walk @xmath20 and the number of segments of the dna chain @xmath77 are equal .",
    "the contour length of the b - dna and the s - dna are connected to the lattice parameters of the random walk by @xmath79 in @xcite , the force - extension curve of a single dna molecule is measured .",
    "an overstretching transition at @xmath80pn is observed .",
    "a theoretical model to describe this transition is introduced in @xcite .",
    "this model contains @xmath1 posteriors and @xmath2 priors .",
    "the present model contains @xmath2 parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath50 . the ratio @xmath81 is considered to be a prior ( like in @xcite ) , while @xmath41 and @xmath50 are posteriors . in figure",
    "[ fig : sb ] , the experimental data from @xcite are shown together with the theoretical curves of @xcite and the present model .",
    "the two models give an equally good description of the experimental data .",
    "the force - extension relation of the present model is obtained with a constant temperature @xmath82k and with following values of the model parameters @xmath83 nm , @xmath84 , @xmath85pn .",
    "the typical length of one basepair in b - dna is @xmath73 nm . as a consequence the contour length of b - dna is equal to @xmath86 nm .",
    "together with ( [ connection_dna_walk ] ) , one obtains @xmath87 .",
    "so the number of base pairs in one segment is of the order of @xmath4 . in @xcite",
    "the values @xmath88 and @xmath89 are used for the number of base pairs in one segment .",
    "this means that the two theoretical models ignore interactions that make the dna molecule stiffer .",
    "this is not unexpected , because both models use very simple hamiltonians .",
    "the good representation of the experimental data shows that the theoretical models are able to catch the essence of the overstretching transition when effective parameters are introduced .",
    "these effective parameters , like the number of base pairs in one segment , are then used to artificially increase the stiffness of the molecule .",
    "the two theoretical models contain several adjustable parameters .",
    "so a good representation of one dataset is not really surprising .",
    "therefore we test our model further by studying the salt and temperature dependence of the overstretching transition . in figures [ fig : bloom1 ] and [ fig : bloom2 ] the results of our theoretical model are shown together with the experimental data of @xcite and @xcite respectively . in @xcite the salt dependence of the transition is studied while in @xcite the temperature dependence is studied .",
    "the value of the prior @xmath81 is equal to @xmath90 for all the theoretical curves .",
    "the values of the posteriors are obtained by a least squares analysis . for every curve @xmath91",
    "is defined by @xmath92 with @xmath93 the number of datapoints of the curve .",
    "the values of the posteriors @xmath94 and @xmath71 are fixed by minimising this expression of @xmath91 .",
    "the result can be found in tables [ tab : salt ] and [ tab : temp ] .",
    "the sensitivity of the least square analysis is tested by the following procedure .",
    "we keep the value of one of the fit parameter fixed ( at the value that minimises @xmath91 ) while varying the other .",
    "it turns out that the value of @xmath91 is doubled after a variation of @xmath95 in the parameter @xmath71 and after a variation of @xmath96 in the parameter @xmath94 .",
    "this shows that the least squares analysis is more sensitive to variations in @xmath94 than to variations in @xmath71 .",
    "important to mention is that we used the exact formulas of appendix [ app ] for the least squares analysis , although the approximations of appendix [ app2 ] are very reliable for the values of the parameters used in figures [ fig : bloom1 ] and [ fig : bloom2 ] .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : approx ] where we included a curve with the same values of the adjustable parameters as in the far left curve of figure [ fig : bloom1 ] .",
    "the theoretical curves are only shown from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , because the salt dependence ( and temperature dependence ) at low forces is not well described by the present model .",
    "the model contains three parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath50 .",
    "roughly these parameters determine the factor ( @xmath99 ) by which the contour length is increased , the value of the overstretching force and the steepness of the transition . when the concentration of salt in the solvent increases , dna becomes more stable . as a consequence the value of the overstretching force and the steepness of the transition increase , while @xmath99 remains the same .",
    "this can be captured by the present model and results in a decrease of value of the fit parameters @xmath71 and @xmath94 ( see table [ tab : salt ] )",
    ". a closer look at the experimental data of @xcite shows that the force - extension behaviour at low forces depends less on the salt concentration than at intermediate and high forces .",
    "this can not be captured by the present model because the low and high force behaviour can not be changed independently . in @xcite ,",
    "only the influence of na@xmath100 on the overstretching transition is studied .",
    "the dependence of the transition on multivalent cations like mg@xmath101 is studied in @xcite . a clear change in the low force behaviour is observed when mg@xmath101 is added to the solution .",
    "our model contains less adjustable parameters in comparison with the other theoretical models studied in the literature .",
    "this leaves room for extending our model with one extra parameter which can capture the low force behaviour for different solvent conditions .",
    "figure [ fig : lin ] shows the value of the parameter @xmath94 as a function of the logarithm of the salt concentration .",
    "the error bars in this figure show when the value of @xmath91 is doubled by variation of @xmath94 while keeping @xmath71 fixed .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath94 is approximately a linear function of the logarithm of the salt concentration .    as already mentioned in the introduction",
    ", one can assume that force - extension relations are measured under equilibrium conditions when no hysteresis is observed . in @xcite",

    "titin is a long protein that contains approximately @xmath5 amino acids . in the literature , the dynamic force - extension relation of this protein",
    "is extensively studied @xcite . in @xcite , the static ( equilibrium )",
    "force - extension relation of titin is also measured .",
    "the protein can be divided into two parts , the i - band and the a - band . at relatively low forces ,",
    "the major contribution to the elasticity of titin comes from the i - band . only at very large forces",
    ", the a - band becomes important .",
    "for that reason we consider only the i - band in this article .",
    "the i - band consists of a pevk region ( that contains @xmath110 amino acids ) that is flanked by @xmath111 immunoglobulin domains @xcite .",
    "these immunoglobulin domains are folded parts of the protein containing approximately @xmath112 amino acids . without applied force ,",
    "the chain of amino acids of the pevk region and the chain of immunoglobulin domains behave like random coils .",

    "meanwhile , the immunoglobulin domains line up ( without unfolding ) in the direction of the applied force . at high forces , the immunoglobulin domains will unfold one by one to further increase the contour length of the polymer .",
    "we consider the pevk region and the immunoglobulin domains as two completely independent parts of the protein .",
    "the average extension of the complete protein @xmath57 is then simply the sum of the average extension of the immunoglobulin domains @xmath113 and the average extension of the pevk region @xmath114 @xmath115 the indices @xmath116 and @xmath117 are used for the variables of the immunoglobulin domains and the pevk region respectively .",
    "a similar formula for the entropy of the complete system holds @xmath118 .",

    "the sign of @xmath120 is negative because a folded immunoglobulin domain should be energetically favourable .",

    "with so many adjustable parameters it is no surprise that figure [ fig : titin ] shows a very good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results at low and intermediate forces . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a comprehensive experimental study of the static force - extension relation of titin is not yet available in the literature .",
    "so an in depth comparison between theoretical and experimental results is not yet possible .",
    "to summarise , we study the three - dimensional persistent random walk with drift .",
    "we obtain analytical formulas for the average of the macroscopic variables of interest as a function of the model parameters .",
    "finally , the resulting thermodynamic model is used to study polymer stretching experiments .",
    "we derive force - extension relations for two different polymers , overstretched double - stranded dna and the protein titin .",
    "the molecules of double - stranded dna and of the protein titin are non - oriented .",
    "therefore , each walk and its mirror images must have the same probabilities .",
    "this is indeed the case in absence of an external force .",
    "however , in the presence of an applied force this is only the case when the distance between the endpoints in the direction of the force does not change under mirroring .",
    "we imposed this symmetry in the definition of the transition probabilities ( [ syymmm ] ) .",
    "the substitution @xmath134 has no effect on the transition probabilities , contrary to the substitution @xmath135 .    note that we did not assume the boltzmann - gibbs form for the equilibrium probability distribution .",
    "rather , following @xcite , we define the temperature by calculating the legendre transform of the entropy .",
    "the results of @xcite and the present paper show that it is possible to construct a thermodynamic model without the assumption of the boltzmann - gibbs distribution .",
    "moreover , we believe that the results of the present paper prove that our approach is more than a mathematical exercise and can be used to study real physical systems . figures [ fig : exte ] and [ fig : phase ] show that the present model contains three separate phases , the random phase ( high temperature ) , the stretched phase ( high force ) and the compact phase ( low temperature and force ) . in principle a true phase transition can occur in our finite model because we did not assume the boltzmann - gibbs form for the equilibrium distribution .",
    "to be sure that only gradual transitions show up in our model , we checked that the free energy is a convex function of the control parameters .",
    "the transition between the compact and the stretched phase is a gas - liquid - like transition .",
    "the boundary line between these two phases ends in an approximate triple point at which the peak in @xmath63 disappears .",
    "the applicability of our thermodynamic model is limited to experiments that are performed under equilibrium conditions .",
    "force - extension relations are measured under these circumstances when no hysteresis is observed .",
    "the overstretching transition of dna under equilibrium conditions has been studied more extensively than the force - extension relation of titin .",
    "for this reason , the comparison between experimental and theoretical results is more comprehensive for the former than for the latter in the present paper .",
    "figure [ fig : titin ] shows that our model gives at least a qualitative representation of the experimental static force - extension relation of the protein titin @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : bloom1 ] and [ fig : bloom2 ] show that our model gives a consistent description of the overstretching transition of dna at intermediate and high forces .",
    "this means that the force - extension relations obtained with our theoretical model fit well to the experimental curves for varying environmental conditions ( different salt concentrations @xcite and temperatures @xcite ) . in the literature",
    "different analytically solvable models are introduced to study the overstretching transition .",
    "the model @xcite proposed by punkkinen et al .  is the only one that is tested against different datasets , obtained under varying salt concentrations .",
    "it gives an adequate description over the whole range of the force - extension curve and not only in the transition region .",
    "an important difference between our model and the model of punkkinen et al .",
    "is that the latter model contains more adjustable parameters than our model .",
    "this leaves room to extend our model with some extra parameter in order to correct the behaviour at small forces .    in figure",
    "[ fig : phase ] the positive slope of the boundary line , between the compact and the stretched phase of the random walk , is clearly visible .",
    "it is an open question whether this so called reentrant behaviour can be observed in any of the experiments that we discussed in the present paper . in @xcite ,",
    "phase diagrams of the force - induced unfolding of single - domain proteins ( e.g.  immunoglobulin domains of titin ) are obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "these phase diagrams show also reentrant behaviour . as already pointed out in @xcite , the interaction between the solvent and the biopolymer depends on the temperature . as a consequence ,",
    "the phase diagrams of the present paper and @xcite are only reliable for the study of the stretching experiments on biopolymers for small temperature variations . in the present model , the value of the parameter @xmath50",
    "is determined by the interaction between the solvent and the biopolymer .",
    "this parameter is an effective parameter .",
    "therefore its value can still depend on the temperature ( see figure [ fig : bloom2 ] and table [ tab : temp ] ) .    in principle one can nowadays perform two types of stretching experiments in two different ensembles . in one type of experiment ,",
    "the two ends of the molecule are held at fixed positions and the fluctuating force is measured ( the fixed - stretch ensemble ) . in the other type of experiment , the force applied to the endpoints of the molecule",
    "is kept constant and the fluctuating extension is measured ( the fixed - force ensemble ) .",
    "theoretical calculations @xcite show that the force - extension relations obtained in the two ensembles do not coincide in general , although the differences are small and disappear in the long chain limit .",
    "the results of the present paper are limited to the fixed - force ensemble , although the discussed experiments are performed in the fixed - stretch ensemble . in @xcite , it is shown how the results of the fixed - force ensemble can be extended to the fixed - stretch ensemble for the one - dimensional persistent random walk with drift .",
    "similar calculations for the three - dimensional random walk are not yet possible because an explicit expression for the joint probability distribution @xmath136 is still lacking @xcite .",
    "this is the probability to end in position @xmath17 with @xmath14 changes of direction after @xmath20 steps .",
    "based on the results of the one - dimensional walk @xcite we assume that one can ignore the differences between the two ensembles for the long polymers which are studied in the present paper .",
    "our results prove that the persistent random walk with drift is an interesting model .",
    "two possible extensions are already suggested above .",
    "one can try to improve the applicability of the random walk to the overstretching transition of dna by introducing one more parameter in the model .",
    "one can also try to find an explicit expression for the joint probability distribution @xmath136 along the lines of @xcite .",
    "this will not only allow to calculate the force - extension relation in the fixed - stretch ensemble @xcite , but also to quantify the deviations from the boltzmann - gibbs distribution @xcite .",
    "finally , one can also try to extend the applicability of the present model to experiments that are performed under non - equilibrium conditions . to this purpose",
    "one can assume , along the lines of superstatistics @xcite , that the model parameters are stochastic variables which have some probability distribution .",
    "the major problem is then to determine this time - dependent probability distribution .",

    "then , the cubic equation in @xmath142 ( [ derde ] ) and the formula for the average endposition ( [ x ] ) can be approximated in the transition region ( @xmath70 ) by following expressions @xmath146 the first equation is now a quadratic equation in @xmath142 .",
