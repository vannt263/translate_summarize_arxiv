    "when a fluid , a fluid mixture , a binary alloy or an ising magnet that is close to a critical point in bulk is brought to a surface its properties are altered significantly .",
    "in particular the bulk universality class is divided into several surface universality classes which depend on whether the tendency to order at the surface is increased or decreased w.r.t that in bulk  @xcite . for the case of ising magnets",
    "the phenomenology is well - understood : the critical behavior of the semi - infinite system is governed by a surface scaling field @xmath2 which describes the enhancement of interactions in the surface layer .",
    "@xmath3 corresponds to a reduced tendency to order in the surface and @xmath4 defines the fixed point of the renormalization group transformation of the ordinary transition .",
    "similarly @xmath5 defines the fixed point for the extraordinary transition and @xmath6 corresponds to the special transition .",
    "such a classification pertains to vanishing ( external ) surface field @xmath7 , a situation which is easily realized for the ising magnet but not for a fluid ; the containing walls must always exert a non - zero surface field of some type . usually the wall or substrate is assumed to exert an effective potential on the fluid that is infinitely repulsive at short distances and strongly attractive at large distances .",
    "such potentials give rise to pronounced peaks in the density profile of the fluid near the substrate leading to strongly positive adsorption and in magnetic language this corresponds to @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a substrate should decrease the net fluid - fluid attraction between an atom and its nearest neighbors below the corresponding bulk value so that @xmath3 . thus fluids are expected to lie in the universality class of the normal transition with fixed point @xmath9 and @xmath4 . since the shapes of the order parameter profiles should be the same whether the symmetry is broken by the external surface field , @xmath10 , or spontaneously , @xmath11 , the normal and extraordinary transitions should be equivalent  @xcite , provided the symmetry breaking fields are sufficiently ( infinitely ) strong .    in recent years much effort has been focused on understanding the crossover from the normal to the ordinary transition , i.e. the regime of weak surface fields . the length scale associated with the surface scaling field @xmath12 is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the bulk correlation length exponent and @xmath15 is the surface gap exponent . for a semi - infinite ising - like system ritschel and",
    "czerner  @xcite showed that for small @xmath12 the order parameter profile can take a non - monotonic form , increasing with distance @xmath16 from the surface for @xmath17 before decreasing for @xmath18 .",
    "this is quite different from the case of strong field adsorption where the profile decays monotonically , as @xmath19 , at the critical point .",
    "such behaviour is not predicted by mean - field treatments of ising systems but was confirmed in several subsequent studies  @xcite ; it is also found in exact results for the @xmath20 ising model  @xcite",
    ". physically @xmath21 corresponds to the distance from the surface over which the order parameter responds linearly with field @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the critical length scale @xmath21 has important consequence for _ confined _ systems near bulk criticality .",
    "there are three relevant lengths : @xmath21 , the distance @xmath22 between the two confining surfaces which both exert fields @xmath12 and the bulk correlation length @xmath23 .",
    "sufficiently close to bulk criticality one can investigate the regime where @xmath22 is comparable to @xmath21 with @xmath24 .",
    "in a recent study  @xcite of the critical @xmath20 ising film order parameter profiles with two symmetric maxima at @xmath25 and @xmath26 were obtained for weak fields @xmath12 . for even weaker fields when @xmath27 the maxima merge into a single one at midpoint , @xmath28 .",
    "that study provides some of the motivation for the present one where we investigate the density profiles and the gibbs adsorption for a simple ( lennard - jones ) fluid at bulk criticality that is confined by two planar walls separated by a distance @xmath22 .",
    "we enquire whether phenomena analogous to these found for ising systems subject to weak surface fields are found in fluids .",
    "as implied earlier , it is not at all obvious that one can achieve the analogue for a fluid of surface magnetic field @xmath29 .",
    "thus it is not clear , a priori , that a physical length scale @xmath21 should exist . on the other hand",
    ", one knows that for a purely repulsive wall complete drying with adsorption @xmath30 ( wetting by gas ) occurs below the critical temperature @xmath31 whereas for a strongly attractive wall complete wetting by liquid occurs , @xmath32 , so that one might imagine a scenario whereby for _ weak _ wall - fluid attraction the adsorption @xmath1 is close to zero .",
    "moreover , if @xmath33 for all states on the critical isochore , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , one might argue that the fluid is exhibiting one of the features of the ising magnet subject to a vanishing @xmath12 .",
    "in other words , by suitably tuning the wall - fluid potential can one mimic the situation @xmath7 , i.e. the ordinary transition ?",
    "of course , finding a wall - fluid potential that corresponds _ precisely _ to @xmath7 , i.e. , one that generates precisely the same features in the profiles and , therefore , the adsorption for all @xmath36 , seems very unlikely - given the lack of ising symmetry in any real fluid .",
    "however , if one does find a wall - fluid potential that is neutral , giving rise to @xmath37 , then one might also expect to see phenomena associated with small @xmath12 , i.e. the mesoscopic length scale @xmath21 .",
    "the existence of such phenomena would imply that the ordinary transition is not unique to systems with ising symmetry and would lend support to the general idea of fluid - magnet universality .",
    "we are not aware of any published proof that a fluid system can not undergo the ordinary transition  @xcite .",
    "the only rigorous result for fluids  @xcite is for a planar hard wall where an exact sum rule analysis shows that the surface critical behaviour lies in the universality class of the normal transition and the surface critical exponents can be expressed in terms of bulk critical exponents , as predicted originally in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "what is the experimental situation ? to the best of our knowledge there is no experiment that probes critical adsorption in the weak surface field regime for a one - component fluid  @xcite . for binary fluid mixtures",
    "there is strong evidence from ( i ) reflectivity studies of critical carbon disulphide - nitromethane mixtures adsorbed at a silanated borosilicate glass surface  @xcite and ( ii ) ellipsometric studies of an homologous series of critical @xmath38 alkane - methyl formate mixtures  @xcite that the weak adsorption , @xmath12 small limit , is achieved . in the second of these papers",
    "the authors fit their data to a universal scaling function which depends explicitly on @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "they argue that as the @xmath38 alkane increases from @xmath39 to @xmath40 the preferentially adsorbed component at the non - critical gas / liquid mixture surface changes from the @xmath38 alkane to methyl formate and that this implies an effective surface field @xmath12 which is small and which changes sign as @xmath38 is increased .",
    "more specifically they associated @xmath12 with the difference between the gas - liquid surface energies of the @xmath38 alkane and methyl formate in the mixture . in practice",
    "this was taken to be the difference between gas - liquid surface tensions of pure @xmath38 alkane and pure methyl formate  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath12 determines whether a particular component is preferentially adsorbed at the interface it is certainly feasible that one can have @xmath7 , at least for a certain range of temperatures .",
    "however , it is still not clear that a given @xmath38 alkane - methyl formate mixture corresponds to a system undergoing an ordinary transition .",
    "an earlier reanalysis of surface tension data for isobutyric - acid - water mixtures suggests that the scaling properties are those of a system with a weak surface field , interpreted as the field that determines the preferential adsorption of one component at the non - critical interface @xcite .",
    "the author also makes the important observation that similar weak - field characteristics should be found at the non - critical interfaces of any binary liquid mixture undergoing a wetting transition close to the critical endpoint  @xcite . for a one - component fluid adsorbed at a solid substrate",
    "this situation corresponds to the wetting transition being close to the gas - liquid critical point , a scenario which is expected if the wall - fluid attraction is weak .",
    "crossover between strong and weak - field critical adsorption has been observed in very recent x ray diffraction studies of sublattice order in epitaxial feco films grown on an mgo substrate  @xcite ; feco undergoes a continuous order - disorder transition from the b2 phase ( cscl structure ) to the a2 phase ( bcc structure ) and the substrate favors ( weak ) critical adsorption of the b2 phase for @xmath41 .",
    "our paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : is ] we summarize results for the weak surface field behaviour of ising systems in the semi - infinite lattice and in film geometry .",
    "the magnetization profiles obtained for the latter are directly relevant to our study of a confined fluid . sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] reports the results of monte carlo simulations of the density profiles and adsorption of the truncated lennard jones fluid confined between two planar walls that exert a standard ( 10 - 4 ) wall - fluid potential .",
    "results are presented at the bulk critical point , and for some states on the critical isochore , for various values of a parameter @xmath42 that multiplies the ( 10 - 4 ) potential . by varying @xmath42",
    "we tune the strength of wall - fluid interactions relative to fluid - fluid interactions .",
    "@xmath42 plays a role similar to that of @xmath12 for the ising system and for certain values of this parameter we find the system is neutral. this is confirmed by studies of capillary condensation below @xmath31 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dft ] we describe the results of density functional calculations of the density profiles for the same model system as studied by simulation . by comparing the two sets of results we can assess the role of true surface criticality since the density functional approach is a mean - field one .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concs ] with a discussion and summary .",
    "we consider an ising magnet on a semi - infinite lattice with nearest - neighbour pairs of spins interacting ( in bulk ) with the exchange coupling constant @xmath43 .",
    "the influence of the surface on the system is usually taken into account by introducing a modified coupling between spins in the surface layer , @xmath44 , and an ( external ) surface magnetic field @xmath45 imposed on these boundary spins  @xcite .",
    "for vanishing bulk magnetic field , @xmath46 , the hamiltonian of the model reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the volume of the lattice and @xmath49 the surface layer . in the absence of the surface field the leading critical behavior of various surface quantities depends on the ratio @xmath50 and is described by three different surface universality classes  @xcite . at the bulk critical point , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and at the special value @xmath53",
    "the tendency to order near the surface is unchanged with respect to the bulk .",
    "this situation corresponds to the surface universality class of the `` special transition '' .",
    "the condition @xmath54 represents the universality class of the `` ordinary transition '' where the surface has a reduced tendency to order but becomes passively ordered at the bulk phase transition . for @xmath55",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking also occurs above the critical point and on reducing @xmath36 the bulk orders in the presence of an already ordered surface .",
    "this situation corresponds to the `` extraordinary transition '' . in the renormalization - group analysis",
    "@xmath56 is an unstable fixed point , whereas for any starting value @xmath54 the surface coupling is driven to the stable fixed point @xmath57 by successive renormalization - group transformations .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath55 the coupling is driven to the stable fixed point @xmath58 . in the framework of continuum field theory , appropriate to the universality class of the ising model",
    ", the standard @xmath59 ginzburg - landau model is augmented to include the surface by adding the surface contribution : @xmath60 where the parameter @xmath2 can be related to the surface enhancement of the spin - spin coupling constant in the lattice models  @xcite .",
    "the leading critical behavior of a semi - infinite system with an ordinary or an extraordinary surface transition is described by stable renormalization - group fixed - point values @xmath61 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the fixed point for the special transition is at @xmath6 .",
    "so far we have not included the effect of the surface field @xmath12 on the critical system .",
    "the presence of the surface field explicitly breaks the order - parameter ( op ) symmetry at the surface inducing ordering in the surface layer for @xmath62 .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the extraordinary transition , i.e. @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , is equivalent to the case with @xmath65 but with de - enhanced surface couplings : @xmath54 @xmath66 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the so called `` normal '' transition described by the fixed point @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the term normal is used because the situation with @xmath65 and @xmath54 @xmath66 should be generic for simple fluids or fluid binary liquid mixtures bounded by a substrate or wall .",
    "most substrates will attract molecules in a one component fluid giving rise to positive adsorption .",
    "similarly for a binary mixture the substrate will favor one species of the fluid giving rise to preferential adsorption of that species .",
    "both situations correspond to @xmath65 .",
    "moreover for fluids near walls the number of nearest - neighbor fluid bonds is reduced with respect to the bulk which implies @xmath54 or @xmath67 .    a topic of considerable recent interest concerns the crossover region between the limiting values @xmath9 and @xmath7 . at the normal transition the op ( magnetization ) profile @xmath68 decays monotonically from @xmath69 ( all spins aligned ) at the surface @xmath70 to the bulk equilibrium value which is zero for @xmath35 , the bulk critical temperature and is nonzero for @xmath71 .",
    "at the critical point the decay is described by a universal power law @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath14 are the usual bulk exponents , for distances large compared to all length scales . in @xmath74 the ising model exponents give @xmath75  @xcite . by contrast , for @xmath7 and @xmath35 , at the ordinary transition , the magnetization profile is zero at any distance from the wall since the op symmetry is not broken through the whole system  @xcite .",
    "it is of considerable interest to enquire about the profile for small but non - zero @xmath12 , i.e. in the crossover regime between the ordinary and normal transitions .",
    "mean - field treatments do not predict any interesting behaviour of the magnetization profile ; @xmath68 starts from a non - zero value @xmath76 and then decays monotonically to zero  @xcite .",
    "however , as has been shown  @xcite recently , for small @xmath12 close to the ordinary transition the critical fluctuations may lead to non - monotonic profiles . near the surface @xmath68 may increase steeply with @xmath16 to values much larger than @xmath76 . near bulk",
    "criticality the range over which this rise occurs depends on @xmath12 through the length scale induced by this field . in an ising system near the ordinary transition ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath77 , there is a single relevant surface scaling field @xmath12  @xcite and the length scale induced by this field is @xmath13 , where @xmath78 is the surface gap exponent  @xcite . at the bulk critical point",
    "the magnetization is given by @xmath79 with @xmath80  @xcite . in the @xmath74 ising model @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "so @xmath68 _ increases _ with @xmath16 near the surface . for @xmath83",
    "the profile has a maximum , and only for @xmath18 does crossover to the normal decay @xmath84 take place . for weak surface fields",
    "@xmath21 can be large ( mesoscopic ) and thus the increase of the magnetization profile can occur over a mesoscopic distance . in turn , this may influence the behavior of the critical adsorption slightly above @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the short - distance behavior of the magnetization profile , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mag ] ) , follows from the critical - point scaling of @xmath68 and the ( continuity ) assumption that @xmath85 .",
    "since at the ordinary transition the surface layer remains paramagnetic at @xmath86 it should respond linearly to a weak surface field @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the same should hold in the immediate neighbourhood of a surface , thus @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "assuming linear response for the scaling function leads to ( [ eq : mag ] )  @xcite .",
    "a further heuristic explanation of the short - distance growth of the op at the ordinary transition was given in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the behaviour of correlations in the near - surface region . using scaling analysis and arguments taken from short - distance expansions",
    "it was argued that there exists an _ effective _ parallel correlation length @xmath89 which marks the crossover of the parallel correlation function from `` bulk '' to `` surface '' behavior . at @xmath86 the correlations decay algebraically .",
    "the decay in planes parallel to the surface is described by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the distance within the plane parallel to the surface and the exponent @xmath92 depends on the distance @xmath16 from the surface . for @xmath93 , in the near - surface region , @xmath94 assumes its bulk value @xmath95 ( slow decay ) if @xmath96 whereas for @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( fast decay ) , so we can infer the effective range of correlations @xmath99 .",
    "now assume a weak surface field is imposed at bulk criticality on the surface with @xmath100 .",
    "the magnetization induced in response at a distance @xmath16 from the surface should be proportional to @xmath12 , to the correlation function in the perpendicular direction describing the decay of the order , @xmath101 , and to the correlated area in the plane parallel to the surface , @xmath102 , which can be influenced by a single surface spin . together",
    "these terms give @xmath103 scaling relations @xcite give in turn @xmath104 and we recover ( [ eq : mag ] ) .",
    "many of the above predictions were confirmed by monte - carlo simulations for the @xmath74 ising model  @xcite and by detailed renormalization group studies of a @xmath59 model  @xcite .",
    "exact results  @xcite and monte carlo simulations  @xcite for the @xmath20 ising model yield magnetization profiles that also increase near the surface for the case of a weak surface field .",
    "however , in @xmath20 the simple power law ( [ eq : mag ] ) is modified by a logarithm , i.e. @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "note that in mean - field theory @xmath107 so that @xmath108 and the magnetisation profile decays monotonically as stated above .",
    "in this subsection we consider film geometry , i.e. a lattice of finite width @xmath22 in the @xmath16 direction but infinite in the other directions .",
    "the critical properties of such a confined system should be particularly sensitive to the value of the ( identical ) surface fields when the length scale @xmath21 becomes comparable to or larger than the width @xmath22 .",
    "recent studies of critical @xmath20 ising films of finite width @xmath22 subject to identical surface fields @xmath109 using exact transfer - matrix diagonalization and density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) methods fully confirmed this expectation  @xcite . for weak surface fields such that @xmath110 , magnetization profiles at @xmath111 have two symmetric maxima shifted away from the walls and lying at @xmath25 and @xmath112 ( see fig.[fig : ispr ] ) . in this regime of @xmath12",
    "the surface magnetization @xmath113 decreases fairly rapidly as the value of @xmath12 decreases , whereas the value of the magnetization at the midpoint of the film , @xmath114 , changes only very slightly .",
    "the two separate maxima merge into one , broad maximum located at the middle of the film for smaller @xmath12 where @xmath115 . for even smaller @xmath12 , @xmath116 and",
    "the profiles are nearly flat with the magnetization much lower near the walls than in the central part of the system . in this regime",
    "the magnetization both at the surface and near the midpoint , in fact through the whole profile , decreases as @xmath117 ( the logarithmic factor is specific to the @xmath20 ising model ) .",
    "this result agrees with the physical interpretation of @xmath21 as a length scale up to which the op profile responds linearly ( up to the logarithmic factor ) to the surface field .",
    "note that the change in the shape of the magnetization profile from one with two maxima to one with a single maximum at the center of a film can be achieved either by decreasing @xmath12 at fixed @xmath22 or by decreasing @xmath22 at fixed @xmath12 .",
    "this change is accompanied by a rich variation of the solvation force  @xcite .",
    "the latter is an important thermodynamic quantity characterizing a confined system  @xcite . for a fluid",
    "the solvation force is the excess pressure over the bulk arising from confinement by walls ; it can be measured by the surface force apparatus . for the ising system the solvation force @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the finite - size contribution to the free energy .",
    "the critical - point scaling function of the solvation force , i.e. at @xmath86 and @xmath120 , has a pronounced maximum near @xmath121 ( see fig.6 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in this section we describe the results of a monte carlo study of a three dimensional system , namely the truncated lennard - jones fluid , confined between two planar walls separated by a distance @xmath22 . by decreasing the strength @xmath42 of the wall - fluid interactions",
    "while keeping the fluid interparticle potential constant we examine the effects of decreased wall - fluid attraction on the shapes of the density profiles and on the form of the adsorption in the critical fluid . decreasing @xmath42",
    "should , in some sense , correspond to reducing @xmath12 in the ising system discussed in the previous section .",

    "studied , the density near the wall is much higher than the critical density and large packing effects are evident in the profile . as the distance from the wall increases , the density falls progressively ,",
    "although it does not reach the bulk value . the profile is convex downwards with respect to the critical density . for intermediate values of @xmath42 ,",
    "the packing - induced density oscillations near the wall span the critical density , while further away from the wall the magnitude of the profile curvature is generally less than in the large or small @xmath42 limits",
    ". a magnified view of the region around the critical density is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : critprofs](b ) .",
    "strikingly there exist some @xmath42 values in this regime for which @xmath0 exceeds @xmath140 , but the profile is _ concave upwards _ with respect to the critical density .",
    "thus @xmath0 exceeds @xmath140 and _ increases _ with increasing distance from the wall .",
    "as @xmath42 increases , however , one sees ( fig .",
    "[ fig : critprofs](c ) ) the formation of a structure with two smooth maxima in the profile , the maxima being some distance from the walls . on further increasing @xmath42 , the maxima become more pronounced and their positions move closer to the walls .",
    "clearly these results show very similar features to the magnetisation profiles shown in fig.[fig : ispr ] .",
    "it is also instructive to observe the effect of changing the slit width on the double maxima profile of fig .",

    "it is possible that the shape of the external potential has non - trivial repercussions for the short - distance expansion of the order parameter profile .",

    "we shall not attempt to explore the consequences of surface field mixing in any great depth here , although we do hope to report on the matter in future work .",

    "these observations may prove important in exposing more fully the universality of surface critical phenomena for fluids and magnets .",
    "finally , with regard to the applicability of the above considerations to realistic fluids , the question arises as to just what constitutes the surface field @xmath12 in a fluid .",
    "clearly the wall - fluid potential in general couples to the order parameter in the vicinity of the surface and thus can be used to tune its value . however , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : intr ] , a realistic potential such as the 10 - 4 potential used in this work will not allow one to restore the order parameter to its bulk critical value exactly at all distances from the wall .",
    "short ranged packing effects will always be visible close to the wall .",
    "nevertheless , in the context of the ordinary transition , the length scale on which packing effects occurs will be negligible compared to the length scale of the critical phenomena ( set by @xmath21 ) .",
