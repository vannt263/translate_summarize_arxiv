    "considerable interest has been sparked recently by the possibility that disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc s ) could form during the early stages of evolution in high - energy , high luminosity hadron or heavy - ion collisions since this would be a signal of the chiral phase transition@xcite .",
    "the main idea is that near the central rapidity region in these collisions , typically a large amount of energy @xmath10 a few gev is deposited in a volume of order a @xmath11 , corresponding to temperatures above @xmath12 mev at which the chiral symmetry is restored@xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that as these regions cool down through hydrodynamic expansion they might give rise to domains where the order parameter of qcd points in a different direction from the @xmath13 one , resulting in a disoriented chiral condensate ( dccs)@xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that these regions will then act as strong pion lasers , relaxing to the true physical vacuum on time scales of a few fm / c by emitting coherent bursts of pions with very definite isospin correlations@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon would be a striking experimental signature of the chiral phase transition and could provide an explanation for the centauro and anti - centauro ( jacee ) cosmic ray events @xcite .",
    "since trying to understand such phenomena by investigating qcd is currently impossible , efforts have mainly been focussed on the dynamics of low energy effective theories of hadrons , some popular examples being the linear and non - linear @xmath13 models .",
    "the rationale for using a low energy effective theory approach is that , as in the study of critical phenomena , one expects that if a large amplitude coherent configuration of soft modes is produced during the transition , such an occurence should be _ universal _ and only very weakly dependent on the detailed features of the theory .",
    "rajagopal and wilczek@xcite have argued that the @xmath14 linear @xmath13 model encodes the relevant low energy chiral phenomenology of qcd . in particular they argue that the model lies in the same _ static _ universality class as qcd with 2 light flavours , and that @xcite large coherent regions of correlated pions can form _ only _ if the phase transition is strongly out of equilibrium .",
    "they have proposed the `` quench '' scenario in which the initial `` hot region '' supercools through the phase transition via hydrodynamical expansion on time scales much shorter than the relaxation times for long - wavelength fluctuations . as a result",
    ", the system enters into the spinodal region which induces the growth of the unstable long - wavelength modes just as in the process of spinodal decomposition in phase separation@xcite .",
    "this version of a disoriented chiral condensate is somewhat different from the `` baked alaska '' scenario envisaged by bjorken , kowalski and taylor@xcite although the relaxation process of both configurations is similar .",
    "results obtained from studies of both the classical @xcite and quantum linear sigma model @xcite , including hydrodynamical expansion@xcite seem to suggest that there is a range of initial conditions for which there is amplification of pion fluctuations that could lead to the formation of large coherent domains during the chiral phase transition .",
    "however , pions are strongly interacting hadrons , with a typical mean free path in medium of about 2 - 3 fm @xcite under conditions to be achieved at rhic or lhc .",
    "this results in strong final state interactions , and it could be that a dcc signal may be indistinguishable from the background .",
    "there are currently two experiments searching for a dcc signal , t-864 test / experiment at the fermilab tevatron collider@xcite and wa98 at cern - sps@xcite and a proposal for a full acceptance detector at lhc ( felix)@xcite .",
    "it is thus imperative to identify an alternative signature of the chiral phase transition capable of providing information on the early time evolution of the collision and the formation of dcc s or any other out of equilibrium effect associated with the transition .",
    "photons and dileptons are the most promising probes of the early stages of the transition . since they interact mainly electromagnetically , with mean free paths typically much larger than the size of the fireball they carry undistorted information of the initial non - equilibrium stages of the evolution of the plasma .    in this context",
    ", it is important to realize that there are many sources of photons in relativistic heavy - ion collisions : ( i ) direct qcd ( hard ) photons originating from hard partonic processes ( typically drell - yan , and @xmath15 ) , ( ii ) thermal and non - thermal photons originating from the quark - gluon plasma , ( iii ) photons originating from the hadronic gas@xcite .",
    "it is the last process that is of interest to us , and is usually the dominant process in the production of long wavelength photons with energies less than a few hundreds of mev s .",
    "some of the main sources of photons in this energy range are the decay of the neutral pion @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 and resonance decay into photons . of these ,",
    "the leading decay channel for low energy photons is the `` anomalous '' decay of the neutral pion .    in this article",
    "we concentrate solely on photo - production , with the particular goal of obtaining an _ ab initio _ , real - time expression for the photoproduction rate in _ strongly _ out of equilibrium situations .",
    "our main premise is that _ if _ the chiral phase transition is `` quenched '' as envisaged in the scenario of rajagopal and wilczek , with the long - wavelength pion modes becoming unstable , they will grow almost exponentially in the initial stages of the transition , so that these strongly out of equilibrium processes _ must _ result in enhanced photoproduction at low energies .",
    "we note that although we focus on the `` quench '' scenario within a specific phenomenological model , the new kinetic approach developed in this article is more general and not tied to this scenario . in particular , if the transition is strongly first order and is driven by nucleation and growth of hadronic bubbles , as suggested by kapusta and vischer@xcite , this non - equilibrium process should also lead to enhanced photoproduction .",
    "dilepton and photon production from a _ classical _ coherent pion source have been studied by huang and wang@xcite .",
    "these authors studied photoproduction due to a classical blaizot - krzywicki configuration and found a strong dependence on the initial conditions .",
    "however , to our knowledge there has not yet been an attempt to compute the photoproduction rate including quantum and thermal effects and strong non - equilibrium effects as should result from the fast relaxation of dcc s .",
    "it is the point of this article that such a study requires a novel formulation of the kinetics of photoproduction ( and eventually of dilepton production )",
    ".    typical calculations of photoproduction rates assume a system which is in equilibrium or quasi - equilibrium ( steady state ) , and show that the rates are related to the fourier transform of the hadronic current - current correlator @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind our approach is the calculation of expectation values of time evolving observables such as the photon number from first principles , using real - time non - equilibrium quantum field theory@xcite treating the pion instabilities non - perturbatively@xcite .",
    "these non - perturbative methods were introduced within the context of dcc formation in references@xcite .",
    "such framework allows us to go beyond the standard results for the emission rates to study strongly out of equilibrium situations .",
    "in particular we find that the emission rates are given by the hadronic ( pion ) current - current correlation functions , but these are obtained from the full non - equilibrium dynamics of the pion fields .",
    "thus the emission rates and consequently the photon spectrum obtained using this approach reflect all the long range correlations that were generated during the phase transition",
    ". moreover , the rate equation resembles a * generalized kinetic equation * that encodes all the non - equilibrium time scales of dcc formation , growth and relaxation . in particular , we notice the absence of energy conservation at short time scales @xmath10 1 fm / c , and hence photoproduction proceeds via processes that would be kinematically forbidden in an equilibrium situation .",
    "the focus of our article is to study the photoproduction rates from the coherent dcc regions which are formed during the _ non - equilibrium _",
    "stages during a ` quenched ' chiral phase transition including the quantum mechanical and thermal effects .",
    "in section ii we give a summary of the non - equilibrium dynamics of the linear sigma model .",
    "we do not incorporate expansion at this stage , and treat the dynamics of the transition via a `` quench '' . in section iii",
    "we `` gauge '' the sigma model and discuss its range of validity . in section iv ,",
    "we present the details of our novel approach to the kinetics of photoproduction as an initial condition problem .",
    "we obtain the remarkable result that in a situation far from equilibrium , as is the case under consideration , the _ rate _ is @xmath19 ( with the full quantum mechanical current - current correlation function ) . in section",
    "v we discuss the numerical results of the calculations of photoproduction , and show that the distribution function of produced photons is out of equilibrium interpolating between two local equilibrium situations at different temperatures , with an enhanced photoproduction rate for energies below 80 mev .",
    "we also compare the results to the case in which there are no photons initially and conclude that the non - equilibrium enhancement has its origin solely on the pionic instabilities and is insensitive to the initial photon distribution .",
    "the resulting photon spectrum is out of equilibrium and non - thermal .",
    "we compare our results to those obtained recently on photoproduction from the hadronic gas@xcite .",
    "such a comparison unequivocally reveals the non - equilibrium features associated with the dynamics of the phase transition . in section",
    "vi we discuss the contribution from @xmath2 out of equilibrium and argue that it is _ subleading _ compared to the lowest order contribution from the charged pions . in section vii we present our conclusions , summarize the main results and pose new questions .",
    "two appendices are devoted to technical details and a pedagogical example of the novel kinetic approach .",
    "the linear sigma model has been one of the most popular of the phenomenological models to describe the chiral phase transition because it incorporates the correct symmetries and current algebra relations .",
    "obviously such a simple description can not capture all of the details of the underlying theory , qcd , but if the chiral phase transition entails the formation of long - wavelength , coherent pion clouds , one expects this to be a robust feature , fairly independent of the detailed confining dynamics .",
    "this model has been studied intensely from the classical , @xcite semiclassical @xcite , and quantum perspectives both with @xcite and without @xcite expansion . in this article",
    "we do not incorporate either longitudinal or spherical expansion @xcite , but prefer to illustrate the main concepts in the simplest of settings , that of a `` quenched '' transition .",
    "if ( as we will see later ) interesting new physics emerges , there would be motivation to include expansion and other features such as inhomogeneities in the analysis of photoproduction from the dynamics of the disoriented chiral condensates .",
    "here we summarize the main features of the dynamics in the `` quench '' scenario of the _ ungauged _ linear sigma model , and postpone until the next section the subtle details of its gauging .    the lagrangian density for the linear sigma model with an explicit symmetry breaking term is given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is an @xmath22 vector , @xmath23 and @xmath24 represents the @xmath25 pions , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 introduces phenomenologically `` by hand '' a quench situation .",
    "comparison between the `` quench '' approximation@xcite and more realistic treatments including longitudinal and spherical hydrodynamical expansions reveal@xcite that there is no great discrepancy between the different results insofar as the time scales and correlations .",
    "we then take    @xmath28 \\ ; \\ ; ; t_i \\geq t_c \\label{massoft1}\\ ] ]    corresponding to a `` quench '' from the high temperature phase above the critical temperature , to zero temperature .",
    "although we will be dealing with the @xmath14 model with 3 pions , we will use the large @xmath25 limit in order to provide a consistent , non - perturbative framework to study the dynamics .",
    "it can be implemented by use of an auxiliary field consistently to all orders in @xmath29@xcite .",
    "this approximation is renormalizable , energy conserving and maintains all of the ward identities associated with chiral symmetry and current algebra .    as a result , the pions in the asymptotic equilibrium state are exactly massless in the absence of the explicit symmetry breaking term .",
    "a consequence of goldstone s theorem is that the spinodal line _ coincides _ with the coexistence line , so that there are long - wavelength instabilities for all values of the order parameter between zero and the equilibrium minimum @xmath30 .",
    "the non - equilibrium equations of motion are obtained via the tadpole method@xcite : first shift @xmath13 by its expectation value in the non - equilibrium state @xmath31 and then implement the tadpole condition @xmath32 to all orders in the corresponding expansion .",
    "the expectation values of the heisenberg operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 above are to be computed in the initial density matrix , or alternatively , we can compute these expectation values using the schrodinger picture operators and the time - evolved density matrix , as described below .    to leading order in @xmath29",
    "the auxiliary field method@xcite is equivalent to the following hartree like factorization@xcite : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    non - equilibrium quantum field theory requires a path integral representation along a complex countour in time@xcite , with the lagrangian density along this contour given by @xmath38-{\\cal{l}}[\\phi^-]\\ ] ] with the fields @xmath39 defined along the forward ( @xmath40 ) and backward ( @xmath41 ) time branches . for further details",

    "the linear sigma model is a phenomenological model , and its parameters are fixed by the low energy pion physics to be :    @xmath61    the critical temperature @xmath62 is a consequence of the parameters of the model and is somewhat larger than the lattice estimates @xmath63 mev .",

    "there are two reasons for this cutoff : i ) for such a large value of the coupling constant the landau pole is at the order of this scale if the parameters ( the coupling ) are determined at the scale @xmath65 , ii ) more fundamentally , the simple linear sigma model does not incorporate higher mass hadrons , such as vector meson resonances ( with masses @xmath66 ) and nucleons",
    ". the time evolution will only be sensitive to the scale of this cutoff for time scales much smaller than about @xmath67 , but we are interested in longer time scales of a few fm / c and the numerical results on these time scales proved to be insensitive to the values of the cutoff in the range 1 - 2 gev .    the self - consistent numerical solution to the coupled non - linear equations ( [ zeromodeeqn],[modeqns],[inicon],[fluct ] ) with the above values of the parameters leads to a complete description of the dynamics .",

    "the main feature of the dynamics is that for early times @xmath77 a band of long wavevectors `` see '' an inverted harmonic oscillator and grow almost exponentially until the backreaction of the fluctuations and the evolution of the order parameter shut these instabilities off .",
    "these are the `` spinodal '' instabilities that drive the phase transition out of equilibrium .",
    "the numerical analysis reveals that at early times long- wavelength pion modes with wavevectors @xmath78 mev grow almost exponentially , whereas the zero mode of the sigma field , i.e. the order parameter , rolls towards its equilibrium value close to @xmath30 on a time scale @xmath79 .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of @xmath80 vs @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) . as shown in figure 1 , at time scales of the order of @xmath83 the order parameter reaches @xmath30 and begins to oscillate around this value , indicating that the phase transition is almost complete .",

    "the reason that we focus on the phases will become clear when we derive the kinetic equations for photoproduction . in short , since the phases vary rather smoothly and monotonically during this interval , there is no large phase cancellation due to `` dephasing '' of these modes so that they will contribute coherently to photoproduction .",

    "all the relevant microscopic time - scales of the theory are accounted for in this expression .",
    "this is a * generalized quantum kinetic equation * , which avoids the assumption of completed successive scattering processes implicit in a simple boltzmann description .",
    "there is * no energy conservation * on short time scales ( @xmath10 a fermi ) , but memory of the earlier states remains .",
    "this lack of energy conservation on short time scales allows one to study `` transient phenomena''@xcite .",
    "next , the individual terms of this expression have a very physical and simple interpretation in terms of `` rate balancing processes '' .",
    "as shown in fig.(4.a ) the first term represents the difference in rates for two processes : the emission and absorption of a photon and two `` off - shell '' pions in the medium . by `` off - shell '' pions",
    ", we are referring to the pions with fully dressed non - equilibrium propagators in the large @xmath25 approximation .",
    "thus , although the processes conserve momentum , the absence of equilibrium means that they are not energy - conserving .",
    "the second term , depicted in fig.(4b ) , represents a `` bremsstrahlung '' type process and the inverse process of `` scattering '' of a charged pion off a photon .",
    "the reason that we identify the direct process with a `` bremsstrahlung '' type process is because the full dressed pion propagator has insertions of the mean - field and the self - consistent fluctuation as shown in the figures .",
    "these processes can also be identified with a non - perturbative resummation ( large @xmath25 ) of landau - damping type contributions , which in equilibrium and in the usual perturbative expansion only contribute to processes with four momenta below the light cone .",
    "finally the third term , depicted in fig .",
    "( 4c ) represents @xmath159 annihilation into a photon , minus the reverse process , with a photon creating a charged pion pair .",
    "another important point is that , as we show below , the rate vanishes automatically if the system is in equilibrium :    in equilibrium , the pion mode functions are positive frequency plane waves i.e. @xmath160 .",
    "the time integrals can then be easily performed by introducing an adiabatic `` switch - on '' convergence factor for the lower limit of the time integral yielding energy conserving delta functions .",

    "furthermore , upon linearizing near the equilibrium distribution for the photons @xmath162 , i.e. in the `` relaxation time approximation '' , one can easily see that the expression that multiplies @xmath163 is identified with the imaginary part of the photon self - energy to lowest order in @xmath1 evaluated on the photon mass - shell , which vanishes kinematically .",
    "this is of course a well known result : the equilibrium photoproduction rate is given by the imaginary part of the photon self - energy evaluated on the photon mass shell . _ in equilibrium _ the lowest order contribution to the on - shell imaginary part of the photon self - energy arises from compton scattering and pair annihilation diagrams ( and their reverse processes ) in the medium ; these are both @xmath124 effects .",
    "thus we see that _ out of equilibrium _ there are `` off - shell '' processes that give a non - zero @xmath19 contribution to photoproduction .",
    "the equation ( [ rateqn ] ) and these conclusions are some of the more important results of this article .    having established the equivalence with the usual result in the case in which the state is prepared in equilibrium in the infinite past ( in - state ) and evolved in time , we now consider the kinetics of photoproduction as an _ initial condition problem_. in the situation under consideration , i.e. a sudden `` quench '' below the spinodal region in the linear sigma model , the conclusion of the discussion above implies that if one assumes that the system was in ( local ) thermodynamic equilibrium for all times before the quench @xmath164 , then the rate vanishes for @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , let us consider the following initial value problem where the initial density matrix , prepared at time @xmath142 commutes with the respective number operators with some initial distribution of photons and let this initial density matrix evolve in time with the total hamiltonian .",
    "the calculation of the rate goes through in exactly the same manner but now the lower limit of the retarded time integral in ( [ rateqn ] ) is the initial time @xmath142 ( see appendix a for a brief discussion of kinetics as an initial value problem and@xcite for more details ) .      in this section",
    "we present an improvement to equation ( [ rateqn ] ) obtained in the previous section , that represents a _ resummation _ of the perturbative series in @xmath1 .",

    "the expression for the rate given by ( [ rateqn ] ) is obtained by replacing @xmath168 by the zeroth order contributions in terms of free field propagators . the exact expression for the rate ( [ exactrate ] )",
    "gives the rate as a function of time and the initial population @xmath169 , which combined with the schwinger dyson equation for the photon propagators gives the exact rate .",
    "the lowest order term , however , neglects the change in the population providing only the lowest order time evolution .",
    "a resummation must be invoked to incorporate the change of population as a function of time .    the first point to notice",
    "is that @xmath170 in ( [ rateqn ] ) is proportional to the fine structure constant @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of this weak coupling is a signal that there is a separation of time scales in the problem . to be specific ,",
    "the time scales we are referring to are : ( i ) @xmath171 which is the time scale that governs photoproduction ; and ( ii ) the time scale associated with the non - equilibrium processes @xmath10 1 fm / c which are the time scales for evolution of the pion mode functions .",
    "the presence of an @xmath172 in the expression for @xmath170 , guarantees that these two time scales are widely separated .",
    "this means that the photon distribution will show only small deviations from equilibrium on short time scales .",
    "obviously these expressions can not be extended to long time scales since they neglect the changes in the initial distribution .",
    "now consider implementing the following procedure .",
    "let us integrate ( [ rateqn ] ) from some initial time @xmath173 to a time @xmath174 , ( where @xmath175 @xmath176fm / c , i.e. the microscopic time scale ) , hence obtaining @xmath177 .",
    "assuming that the change in the photon distribution function is small during this interval ( an assumption warranted for weak coupling ) , we can then update the value of @xmath178 that enters into the photon green s functions on the rhs of ( [ rateqn ] ) to @xmath177 . in terms of the density matrix , this procedure has the interpretation of starting off with a density matrix that is diagonal in the number basis .",
    "as the system evolves , correlations of the form @xmath179 and @xmath180 are generated , which give rise to off - diagonal terms in the density matrix @xcite .",
    "the updating procedure outlined above neglects these correlations by collapsing the density matrix to a diagonal one at the end of each infinitesimal time step .",
    "this procedure is iterated for all times , resulting in the replacement @xmath181 .",
    "this approximation is similar to that employed in quantum kinetics , known as the generalised kadanoff - baym approximation@xcite .",
    "it can be seen to sum a dyson - like series for the rate@xcite by writing the formal solution iteratively .",
    "a similar resummation scheme is implied by the semiclassical boltzmann equation , in which if the occupation numbers are treated in lowest order , the change is linear in time . replacing the occupation numbers by the time dependent ones in the boltzmann equation leads to a resummation and exponentiation of the time series@xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in@xcite the boltzmann equation assumes completed collisions that result in a coarse graining in time and neglects all of the transient effects and dynamics on short time scales .",
    "see appendix a and @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the approximations involved .",
    "we note that the pion occupation numbers @xmath182 are not updated since the change in the occupation numbers for the pions is accounted for by the evolution of the mode functions through the bogoliubov transformation that determines the time evolution of the particle number@xcite .    since we are using a `` box '' normalization for the particle states , we now pass to the `` continuum '' normalization ( in a volume @xmath52 ) by the replacement @xmath183 @xmath184 and obtain the final form of the invariant rate of photoproduction _ per polarization _",

    "the second stage of the calculation uses the mode functions as input in the numerical evaluation of the rate expression ( [ finalrate ] ) .",

    "the distribution for short wavelength photons is basically not modified from the initial distribution and merges with the initial thermal distribution at @xmath200 .",

    "the reason for this dramatic effect at long - wavelengths is physically clear to understand .",
    "the pion mode functions that enter in the expression of the rate ( [ finalrate ] ) grow exponentially because of the spinodal instabilities for @xmath207 mev as shown in figure ( 2.a ) .",
    "large transferred photon momentum @xmath188 takes the mode functions outside the band of spinodally unstable modes with a much smaller contribution to the rate and total photon yield .",
    "this phenomenon is quite independent of the initial distribution function for the photons and solely a feature of the instabilities associated with the chiral phase transition .    to see that this result is independent of the initial distribution of photons we show in figure ( 7 ) @xmath208 at time 3 fm / c for the case of initial `` vacuum '' conditions on the photon occupation @xmath144",
    "this figure is very similar to the subtracted result displayed in figure ( 5.b ) , thus explicitly showing that the enhancement is solely a consequence of the pion instabilities and independent of the initial photon distribution .",

    "this is an understandable result because at the critical temperature pions are effectively massless with large contribution from their equilibrium distribution functions at long wavelengths .",
    "however , we find that a scenario based on a critical quench is physically quite unlikely .    at this stage",
    "it is very illuminating to compare our results with those obtained for photoproduction from a hadronic gas by kapusta , lichard and seibert@xcite and more recently by steele , yamagishi and zahed@xcite . in reference@xcite",
    "the result for the invariant rate of photoproduction from @xmath210 is given by @xmath211 which for @xmath212 and @xmath213 is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the results shown in figures ( 6,8 ) . in figure 5 of reference@xcite the invariant rate for photoproduction at a temperature",
    "150 mev is shown .",
    "although their initial temperature is smaller than the value used by us , we can see that after normalization of scales and units , the rate that we find for momenta @xmath214 mev ( shown in figures ( 6,8 ) ) is several orders of magnitude _ larger _ than that displayed in that reference .",
    "thus the main conclusion of this comparison : the long wavelength instabilities associated with the fast phase transition below the critical temperature are responsible for a dramatic enhancement of the photoproduction rate and yield for low momenta .",
    "one of the most important sources of low energy photons in a typical heavy ion collision is the decay of the neutral pion into two photons , with a branching ratio of almost @xmath216 .",
    "this process typically produces photons with energies @xmath217 mev .",
    "thus it is important that we quantify the contribution of @xmath95 decay to the non - equilibrium production of photons during the phase transition .",
    "it is straightforward to perform the calculation leading to the rate of photoproduction , now including the anomalous vertex given by ( [ anomalousvertex ] ) .",
    "the lowest order contribution is of @xmath124 , because each anomalous vertex is of @xmath19 , and depicted in figure ( 9 ) .",
    "notice that the intermediate state has one pion propagator , therefore _ two _ mode functions @xmath53 .",
    "this contribution must be compared to the one - loop contribution depicted in figure ( 3 ) , which is of @xmath19 and the intermediate state has two pion propagators with _ four _ mode functions .",
    "the important point to notice is that the exponentially growing ( spinodally unstable ) modes will give a much larger contribution to the diagram with the pion loop than to the diagram for @xmath218 decay .",
    "furthermore there is a factor of @xmath1 difference between the two giving an even smaller weight to the neutral pion decay diagram in favor of the one - loop pion diagram .",
    "thus we conclude that the non - equilibrium process described in the previous section gives a far larger contribution to the photoproduction rate _ during _ the time of the phase transition than the contribution from neutral pion decay . both because of the fast non - equilibrium growth of spinodally unstable modes and because of the powers of @xmath1 .    we are then led unequivocally to the conclusion that the non - equilibrium photoproduction process through spinodal instabilities is far more efficient than @xmath2 for photons with energy below 80 mev .",
    "in this article we have focused on the description of the process of photoproduction during the non - equilibrium stages of the chiral phase transition and formation of chiral condensates .",
    "the premise of this work is that if the chiral phase transition occurs far from equilibrium , resulting in the possible formation and relaxation of disoriented chiral condensates , the long wavelength pion instabilities will lead to an enhancement of photoproduction at low energies .",
    "we have developed a novel quantum kinetic approach to photoproduction that accounts for the non - equilibrium dynamics in short time scales .",
    "this approach incorporates consistently the dynamics of long - wavelength pion fluctuations that undergo spinodal instabilities during the phase transition .",
    "these instabilities lead to an enhanced photoproduction rate and photoproduction yield at low energies @xmath219 mev . comparing our results with recent results of photoproduction in the hadronic gas@xcite",
    ", we are led to conclude that _ if _ the chiral phase transition occurs far off equilibrium there will be a dramatic enhancement in photoproduction in the energy range below 80 - 100 mev .",
    "this result is independent of the initial photon distribution , and its origin resides solely on the strong instabilities of the pion fluctuations , and thus on the dynamics of the chiral phase transition .",
    "although we have focused on the `` quench '' scenario , our quantum kinetic approach is certainly more general and can be generalized to contemplate the case in which the transition occurs by bubble nucleation as proposed recently@xcite .",
    "our approach did not consider either longitudinal or spherical expansion , since we were interested in understanding if new phenomena could emerge .",
    "the next step is to extend these methods to include expansion@xcite as well as inhomogeneous configurations . in particular",
    ", one can now study the fluctuations around semiclassical configurations , such as the blaizot - krzywicki dcc and perform a calculation along the lines detailed in this article that would include both the classical currents and the quantum fluctuations , thus extending the results of@xcite to include the full quantum and thermal evolution .",
    "another avenue to pursue is a detailed computation of dilepton rates , by extending the kinetic approach developed here , also incorporating the effects of hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "the ultimate goal of such a program is to offer detailed probes of the dynamics of the chiral phase transition either by revealing the formation and relaxation of disoriented chiral condensates or some other type of non - equilibrium phenomena associated with the chiral phase transition .",
    "the energy range in which the enhancement occurs is a difficult one for the present detectors at ags and sps .",
    "however both the full acceptance detector ( felix ) proposed at cern - lhc and the phenix detector scheduled to operate at rhic towards the end of the millenium may provide the necessary resolution at low energies to provide a window to probe these phenomena .",

    "our treatment of photoproduction far off equilibrium is based on a description of kinetics as an initial condition problem .",
    "such an approach , although non - standard in field theory at finite temperatures , has become a standard in the studies of fast processes in semiconductor physics@xcite .",
    "far off equilibrium situations result in solid state physics when semiconductors ( or other materials ) are studied with fast pulsed lasers , which probe the dynamics of these systems on femtosecond scales .",
    "it has been recognized in the last few years that a boltzmann approach that coarse - grains over the microscopic time scales misses most of the important strongly out of equilibrium effects associated with virtual transitions so that the full quantum kinetic equations must be studied .",
    "these equations are typically non - markovian ( with memory kernels ) and non - linear , to allow for non - linear relaxation , thus going well beyond the relaxation time approximation usually invoked in near - equilibrium situations .",
    "a formal kinetic equation for an initial condition problem is obtained as follows .",
    "consider that at some initial time @xmath221 the system is described by a given density matrix @xmath222 that commutes with the number operator @xmath25 , but evolves in time with a hamiltonian that can depend explicitly on time ( as is the case under consideration in this article ) .",
    "the time dependent number operator in the heisenberg picture obeys @xmath223 \\label{heis}\\ ] ] with solution @xmath224dt ' \\label{itera}\\ ] ] this equation leads to an iterative series for @xmath225 in terms of higher order commutators and @xmath226 .",
    "iterating this equation once , and using the assumption that the initial density matrix commutes with the number operator at the initial time , one obtains the following _ exact _ expression for the expectation value of the rate in the initial density matrix , @xmath227\\right]\\rangle dt ' \\label{ratexact}\\ ] ]    the lowest order contribution to the rate results by replacing @xmath228 by @xmath226 .",
    "the expression ( [ ratexact ] ) reveals two important features of the exact expectation value of the rate : i ) the rate vanishes at @xmath221 as a result of the assumption that the initial density matrix commutes with the number operator at the initial time , ii ) the number operator enters formally in the expression above with the time argument that is being integrated .",
    "this expression reveals a non - markovian structure in the rate equation in terms of the memory kernels resulting from the nested commutators , and the argument of the operator number is always integrated in the retarded time integrals .",
    "this observation leads to the generalized kadanoff baym approximation@xcite , in which the calculation of the rate is performed to first order in perturbation theory , corresponding to replacing @xmath229 in ( [ ratexact ] ) , recognizing the proper kernel from this expression ( the double nested commutator ) and finally replacing the expectation values of the number operator at the initial time by the expectation values at the integrated times @xmath230 . by expanding the expectation values in terms of number eigenstates and inserting the identity in terms of these states",
    "one finds that this approximation neglects higher order correlations , in particular off - diagonal matrix elements of the time dependent number operator in the basis of the number operator at the initial time as discussed in section iv . by iterating the resulting expression",
    "one finds that this approximation results in a resummation of the terms akin to the dyson series .",
    "in fact in equilibrium it can be shown@xcite that such a resummation is _ precisely _ a dyson - type approximation .",
    "such a resummation is also implied in the usual boltzmann equation , however , in order to obtain the boltzmann equation more drastic approximations must be made .",
    "they correspond to setting @xmath231 , taking the contribution from the @xmath225 outside the time integral and performing the time integral up to @xmath232 enforcing energy conservation _ a l _",
    "fermi s golden rule .",
    "such a coarse graining approximation is refered to as `` the completed collision approximation '' in the language of quantum kinetics .",
    "this approximation completely neglects dynamics on short time scales and transient effects .",
    "it is known to fail when strongly out of equilibrium processes , ocurring on short time scales are important@xcite .    keeping the memory kernels results in a partial resummation of the exact rate equation akin to the resummation of particular diagrams in the dyson series for self energies and allows to study `` transient '' phenomena associated with the initial stages of relaxation of the initial state @xcite which are completely missed in a boltzmann description , which leads always to exponential relaxation through energy conserving processes .",
    "* two numerical strategies : *    the typical rate equations of quantum kinetics obtained in this article ( [ finalrate ] ) are non - markovian and therefore non - local in time .",
    "there are two ways to deal numerically with these : i ) carry out the retarded integral directly performing all the momentum integrations or ii ) recognize that the rate can be written in the generalized form of a sum of factorized kernels @xmath233 with the supplementary variables @xmath234 that obey the differential equations @xmath235 thus the non - local markovian kernel is traded for a set of local first order differential equations .",
    "since the treatment of kinetics as an initial value problem is not part of the standard lore , we present in this appendix a pedagogical exercise with the purpose of providing the reader a simpler setting within which to understand these concepts and that captures the essence of the scheme that is used in the field theory calculation .",
    "the system that we consider is a simple harmonic oscillator coupled to a _ classical _ source .",
    "this is already a significant departure from the actual problem , where the electromagnetic field couples to the charged pion current which is a quantum - mechanical object , but will allow us to make contact with standard resuls .",
    "thus we proceed with our example which is introduced purely for illustrative purposes .",
    "the hamiltonian for our system is @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 are the canonical coordinate and momenta respectively , while @xmath239 is the oscillator frequency .",
    "the number operator for the oscillator quanta is given by @xmath240.\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath241.\\ ] ] using the heisenberg equations of motion , namely @xmath242 we obtain , @xmath243 > from the equations of motion ( [ hameq ] ) we see that the heisenberg operator @xmath237 satisfies the equation @xmath244 the solutions to the above equation can be written in terms of a homogeneous solution to the operator equation and a c - number piece @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the retarded green s function @xmath247 \\theta(t - t^{\\prime}).\\ ] ] we now compute operator expectation values in an initial equilibrium state specified at @xmath248 which we chose to be the ground state of the unperturbed harmonic oscillator in which @xmath249.the current is switched on at time @xmath248 .",
    "considering this initial state , the expectation value of the number operator in the time evolved state in the presence of the current is given by @xmath250j(t^\\prime)\\ ] ] leading to the final result for the number of quanta produced up to time @xmath150 @xmath251j(t_2 )   \\label{totnum}\\ ] ] we can evaluate the same expectation value in the closed time path formalism outlined in the previous section i.e. @xmath252{\\cal d}[q^-]q^+(t)e^{\\int dt^{\\prime}[l^+-l^-]}\\ ] ] where the lagrangian is @xmath253 therefore , @xmath254 expanding out the exponential and imposing the tadpole condition i.e. @xmath255 , we see that the only non - zero contribution is from the first - order term , which yields : @xmath256 the two point functions can be read off from ( [ gplpl ] ) , ( [ gplmin ] ) and ( [ gfourier > ] ) , giving @xmath257.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus first order perturbation theory gives us the _ exact _ result .",
    "this is of course due to the fact that the current is a c - number object .    at this point",
    "we can make contact with the usual in - out approach based on s - matrix theory to calculate rates .",
    "consider the expression ( [ totnum ] ) in the limit @xmath258 , the total number of quanta created at @xmath259 is given by @xmath260 with @xmath261 being the fourier transform of the current evaluated at the oscillator frequency @xmath239 .",
    "this is the standard result for the case of a non - interacting theory in the presence of a c - number current and makes the connection with the treatment of huang and wang@xcite for the sigma model .",
