    "a couple of years ago , i presented at a large cosmic - ray ( cr ) conference a preliminary version of the theory @xcite i am to summarize here .",
    "the coffee break subsequent to my talk was attended by hundreds of participants . a prominent cr theorist , who had heard my talk , told me : _",
    "` your theory is unacceptable .",
    "it solves the whole problem'_. he paused to make a large hand gesture embracing the surrounding crowd , and added : _  what are then all these people going to do ?",
    "_ was he just joking ? not that i am convinced that we have _ the complete solution _ to the problem .",
    "but , i shall argue , we have _ a _ solution that ockham would have favoured , for the reasons stated in the abstract .",
    "the _ standard _ theory posits that , up to the knee , crs are produced by supernovae ( sne ) @xcite , via shocks in the interaction of their roughly spherical non - relativistic ejecta with the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "the nasa website lists almost 70000 refereed papers on ` cosmic ray(s ) ' , most of them theoretical and ` standard ' .",
    "as implied by a fraction of these papers , the standard theory has problems : it does not accelerate crs up to the knee ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the fraction of sn remnants perhaps compatible with the acceleration of nuclear crs is insufficient to explain the cr luminosity of the galaxy ( e.g.  @xcite ) , crs produced by sn remnants ( most of which are within the ` solar circle ' ) would diffuse outwards , generating a directional asymmetry which is not observed ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "crs above the knee are mysterious .",
    "our theory @xcite is _ non - standard _ in that crs are accelerated _ at all energies _ by the _",
    "relativistic jets _ ejected by sne .",
    "it is part of a ` unified theory of high - energy astrophysics ' @xcite , based on the ` cannonball ' model @xcite of the jets of accreting black holes and neutron stars , which also explains simply the properties of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) @xcite , their respective afterglows ( ags ) @xcite , the gamma ` background ' radiation @xcite , the cr luminosity of our galaxy @xcite , and the properties of galaxy clusters harbouring ` cooling flows ' @xcite .",
    "many more and less self - referring citations are given in @xcite .",
    "the ` cannon ' of the cb model is analogous to the ones responsible for the ejecta of quasars and microquasars . _",

    "the approaching one was ` superluminal ' . _",
    "are grbs made by sne ? _ for long - duration grbs , the answer is affirmative @xcite . the first evidence for a grb  sn association concerned sn1998bw , at redshift @xmath1 , observed within the angular error towards grb 980425 .",

    "the sn light competes at that time with the ag of its grb : it is not always detectable .",
    "it makes sense _ to test _ whether long - duration grbs are associated with a ` standard torch ' sn , akin to sn1998bw , ` transported ' to their respective redshifts .",
    "the test works optimally : _ for all @xmath4 cases in which such a sn could be seen , it was seen ( with varying significance ) _ and _ for all @xmath4 cases in which the sn could not be seen , it was not seen _",

    "besides 9804251998bw , the most convincing association was provided by the spectroscopic discovery of a sn in the ag of grbs 030329 for which even the night when the sn would be discovered was foretold @xcite .    in a cb - model analysis of grbs and their ags @xcite we find that , within the pervasive cosmological factor of a few , the long - grb  sn association would be @xmath61:1 . yet ,",

    "we assume that the mfs , as the cb reaches a quasi - stable radius , are in ` equipartition ' : the mf energy density equals that of the ism particles the cb has temporarily phagocytized .",

    "this result for @xmath23 is supported by the analysis of the spectral evolution of grb ags .    charged particles interacting with turbulently moving mfs tend to gain energy : a ` fermi ' acceleration process .",
    "a ` first - principle ' numerical analysis  @xcite of the merging of two plasmas demonstrates the generation of such chaotic mfs , and the acceleration of a small fraction of the injected particles to the approximate spectrum : @xmath24 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma_{\\rm max}(\\gamma )   & \\simeq & 10 ^ 5\\;\\gamma_0^{2/3}\\;(z / a)\\ ; \\gamma^{1/3 } , \\label{gammaa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the nuclear charge and mass .",
