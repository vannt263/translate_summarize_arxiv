    "in the previous paper @xcite the extensive analysis of the centrality dependence of two measured global variables , transverse energy ( @xmath2 ) and charged particle multiplicity ( @xmath3 ) densities at mid - rapidity as well as their ratio , was delivered .",
    "the analysis was done in the framework of the single freeze - out statistical model @xcite for the au - au collisions at rhic at @xmath0 and 200  gev .",
    "the main idea of this method is as follows .",
    "thermal and geometric parameters of the model are established from fits to particle yield ratios and @xmath1 spectra , respectively .",
    "then , with the use of these parameters both densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as the total charged - particle multiplicity can be estimated and compared with the data . the main reason for doing it is that the transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity measurements are independent of hadron spectroscopy ( in particular , no particle identification is necessary ) , therefore they could be used as an additional test of the self - consistency of a statistical model . in the present paper",
    "the above - mentioned program will be performed once more for the reasons stated below .",
    "first of all fits of the geometric parameters @xcite were done with the use of the preliminary data for the @xmath1 spectra measured at rhic at @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "but the final data @xcite differ substantially from the preliminary ones .",
    "additionally the data points for the @xmath7 analysis were digitized from the plots .",
    "also not all centrality bins were fitted in @xcite .",
    "all of these resulted in the rough qualitative agreement of the model predictions for @xmath5 and @xmath4 for rhic at @xmath6 gev @xcite . and the centrality independence of the total multiplicity of charged particles per participant pair was not reproduced .",
    "the evidence for such scaling of the total multiplicity was reported by the phobos collaboration @xcite .",
    "therefore it was very tempting to check whether the @xmath7 analysis of the final data for the @xmath1 spectra of identified charged hadrons would improve the predictions for transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity densities and the total charged - particle multiplicity .",
    "such a check is _ nontrivial _ and _ does not mean _ simply adding the integrals of the experimental momentum distributions because : ( _ a _ ) spectra are measured in the limited ranges of @xmath1 and the very important low-@xmath1 part is not detected , ( _ b _ ) spectra of stable neutral particles like neutrons and @xmath8 are not measured generally .    as a statistical model the single freeze - out model is taken ( for details",
    "see @xcite ) . the model succeeded in the accurate description of ratios and @xmath1 spectra of particles measured at rhic @xcite .",
    "the main postulate of the model is the simultaneous occurrence of chemical and thermal freeze - outs , which means that the possible elastic interactions after the chemical freeze - out are neglected .",
    "the conditions for the freeze - out are expressed by values of two independent thermal parameters : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the strangeness chemical potential @xmath11 is determined from the requirement that the overall strangeness equals zero .",
    "the second basic feature of the model is the complete treatment of resonance decays .",
    "this means that the final distribution of a given particle consists not only of the thermal part but also of contributions from all possible decays and cascades .",
    "feeding from week decays is included as well .",
    "the main assumptions of the model are as follows : ( _ a _ ) the chemical and thermal freeze - outs take place simultaneously , ( _ b _ ) all confirmed resonances up to a mass of @xmath12 gev from the particle data tables @xcite are taken into account , ( _ c _ ) a freeze - out hypersurface is defined by the equation    @xmath13    ( _ d _ ) the four - velocity of an element of the freeze - out hypersurface is proportional to its coordinate    @xmath14    ( _ e _ ) the following parameterization of the hypersurface is chosen :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the rapidity of the element , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 controls the transverse radius :    @xmath19    where the restriction on the transverse size has been introduced , so @xmath20 gives the maximal transverse extension of the gas in the central slice during the freeze - out .",
    "this means that two new parameters of the model have been introduced , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath21 and @xmath20 , which are connected with the geometry of the freeze - out hypersurface . in general",
    "a freeze - out addresses a 6-dimensional phase - space but the assumption of the hubble - like expansion ( the velocity at the freeze - out is proportional to the coordinate ) , eq .",
    "( [ velochyp ] ) , reduces the number of independent variables to 3 .",
    "and the assumption of the cylindrical symmetry further reduces this number to 2 .",
    "another point is how realistic the assumption of the hubble flow is .",
    "recent results of refs .",
    "@xcite indicate that the hubble flow of the form of eq .",
    "( [ velochyp ] ) can develop in 130 and 200 gev au - au collisions within times 6 - 15 fm .",
    "this is roughly the scale of the freeze - out initializing time predicted in this analysis for all but peripheral bins ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ hypsur ] ) one can see that the beginning of the freeze - out process starts at @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the c.m.s .",
    ", which is also the laboratory frame in the rhic case .",
    "at this moment the volume of the gas can be estimated as    @xmath24    which is simply the volume of a tube with a length @xmath25 and a radius @xmath20 ( @xmath25 is the maximal possible extension of the gas in the longitudinal direction at @xmath26 ) . in the central slice",
    "the freeze - out ceases at @xmath27 and it takes place at @xmath28 .",
    "this _ does not mean _ the end of the freeze - out process completely .",
    "it is the moment when the gas decouples into two pieces symmetrical with respect to the plane @xmath29 and from then the freeze - out proceeds into two opposite directions of the collision axis @xmath30 . for the considered hypersurface , eq .",
    "( [ hypsur ] ) , this process extends to infinity but to be more realistic a limiting condition for @xmath16 will be assumed in sec .",
    "[ totalcharge ] , namely a maximal possible value of @xmath16 called @xmath31 will be postulated .",
    "then the moment when the freeze - out ceases at all will be equal to    @xmath32    at @xmath33 the volume of the region where the freeze - out process has just taken place or is to happen can be estimated as    @xmath34    the transverse velocity in the central slice can be expressed as a function of the transverse radius    @xmath35    the maximum value of @xmath36 called the maximum transverse - flow parameter ( or the surface velocity ) is given by    @xmath37    the invariant distribution of the measured particles of species @xmath38 has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath39    where @xmath40 is the normal vector on a freeze - out hypersurface , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the four - velocity of a fluid element and @xmath43 is the final momentum distribution of the particle in question .",
    "the final distribution means here that @xmath43 is the sum of primordial and simple and sequential decay contributions to the particle distribution ( for details see @xcite ) .    with the use of eqs .",
    "( [ velochyp ] ) and ( [ parahyp ] ) , the invariant distribution ( [ cooper ] ) takes the following form :    @xmath44    where    @xmath45    after changing the integration variable @xmath16 to @xmath46 the invariant distribution ( [ cooper2 ] ) still has the same form but with @xmath47 replaced now by @xmath48 :    @xmath49    that was for the case of unlimited @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath16 is limited and has its maximal value @xmath31 then the invariant distribution ( [ cooper ] ) reads    @xmath50    the same changing of the integration variable @xmath51 can be done and one obtains    @xmath52    the distribution ( [ cooper4 ] ) is still boost invariant because rapidity differences are invariant with respect to the longitudinal boosts .    in practical , _ i.e. _ numerical , calculations of the invariant distribution given by eqs .",
    "( [ cooper2 ] ) and ( [ peu2 ] ) a cut in the integral variable @xmath16 has to be done .",
    "so for the numerical reasons the range of @xmath16 is always finite and @xmath53 .",
    "the value of @xmath54 is chosen in such a way that the remaining `` tails '' of the integral over @xmath16 are negligible .",
    "it has turned out that it is enough to put @xmath55 to determine the geometric parameters @xmath21 and @xmath20 exact to four decimal places .",
    "it should be reminded here that in this paper fits are done to the spectra measured at midrapidity ( @xmath56 ) . also the estimates for @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are done for @xmath56 .",
    "what is more , the values of @xmath31 predicted in sec .",
    "[ totalcharge ] are greater than 3.0 .",
    "thus for the practical calculations at @xmath56 , the case with unlimited @xmath16 covers the case with the finite range of @xmath16 .",
    "the experimentally measured transverse energy is defined as    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the polar angle , @xmath59 denotes @xmath60 ( @xmath61 means the nucleon mass ) for baryons , @xmath62 for antibaryons and the total energy @xmath63 for all other particles , and the sum is taken over all @xmath64 emitted particles @xcite .",
    "the pseudorapidity density of particle species @xmath38 is given by    @xmath65    analogously , the transverse energy pseudorapidity density for the same species can be written as    @xmath66    for the quantities at midrapidity one has ( in the c.m.s . , which is the rhic case )    @xmath67    @xmath68    the overall charged particle and transverse energy densities can be expressed as    @xmath69    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) denote sets of species of finally detected particles , namely the set of charged particles @xmath74 , whereas @xmath71 also includes photons , @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "analyses of the particle ratios and @xmath1 spectra at various centralities in the framework of the single freeze - out model were done for the preliminary rhic data at @xmath6 gev @xcite in @xcite .",
    "this approach proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , thermal parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fitted with the use of the experimental ratios of hadron multiplicities at midrapidity .",
    "it is assumed that these values are independent of the centrality .",
    "this is reasonable since the very weak centrality dependence of the particle ratios has been observed so far .",
    "recent works of ref .",
    "@xcite have just confirmed this assumption .",
    "after then two next parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath20 , are determined from the simultaneous fit to the transverse - momentum spectra of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "both fits are performed with the help of the @xmath7 method .",
    "since the preliminary data for the @xmath1 spectra @xcite differ from the final data @xcite and not all bins were fitted in @xcite , the fit procedure for determination of the geometric parameters of the model , @xmath21 and @xmath20 , has been performed again for the purposes of this paper . additionally , the phenix case at @xmath0 gev has been worked out once more , since the first published data were for three bins only @xcite .",
    "the data for the next two bins , which were not fitted in @xcite , were added in the later report @xcite .",
    "also the brahms spectra at various centralities for the measurement at @xmath6 gev @xcite have not been fitted within the single - freeze - out model until now .",
    "the data points with @xmath81 gev have been excluded in the @xmath7 analysis .",
    "the thermal parameters for the three cases of the maximal rhic collision energy have been taken from the newer studies of the particle abundance ratios @xcite . according to these results ,",
    "the thermal parameters are different for two experiments , phenix and star , in spite of the same collision energy .",
    "fits to mostly phenix ratios gave the lower freeze - out temperature @xcite than fits to star data only @xcite .",
    "this observation has been confirmed in the present analysis : fits to the phenix spectra with substitution of the star freeze - out thermal parameters ( @xmath82 mev and @xmath83 mev @xcite ) and fits to the star spectra with the use of the phenix freeze - out thermal parameters ( @xmath84 mev and @xmath85 mev @xcite ) have proven to be much worse than the fits done within the same experiment and finally reported in this work ( here `` worse fit '' means that its @xmath7/ndf is greater ) .",
    "also it has turned out that brahms spectra fit better with the phenix thermal parameters .",
    "the older estimates of thermal parameters for rhic at @xmath6 gev ( @xmath86 mev and @xmath87 mev ) given in ref .",
    "@xcite have proven to lead to fits to phenix spectra which are not statistically significant for all centralities , @xmath7/ndf @xmath88 .",
    "it should be also mentioned at this point , that the values of thermal parameters ( @xmath89 mev and @xmath90 mev ) obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite result in fits which are much worse , @xmath7/ndf @xmath91 .",
    ".[table1 ] values of the geometric parameters of the model for various centrality bins fitted with the use of the rhic final data for the @xmath1 spectra of identified charged hadrons @xcite .",
    "values of the thermal parameters are taken from the quoted references . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the single freeze - out model has been applied to estimate transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity densities as well as the total multiplicity of charged particles for different centrality bins of rhic measurements at @xmath0 and @xmath92 gev .",
    "these three variables are independent observables , which means that they are measured independently of identified hadron spectroscopy .",
    "since model fits were done to identified hadron data ( particle yield ratios and @xmath1 spectra ) and the global variables are calculable in the single freeze - out model , it was natural to check whether their estimated values agree with the data .",
    "generally the answer is yes , at least on the qualitative level .",
    "this means that the similar shapes of the functional dependence on the centrality of the model predictions have been obtained , only their normalizations differ @xmath93 from the experimental data .",
    "in particular , the most surprising result is the almost ideal independence of the total charged - particle multiplicity per participating pair on the centrality of the collision in the range of centralities covered by the phobos data @xcite .",
    "the range is @xmath94 , that is from the bin around @xmath95 centrality up to the most central one .    even for @xmath3 and @xmath2 this analysis is nontrivial and does not mean simply a self - consistency check of various measurements . first , transverse momentum spectra are measured in _ limited ranges _ , so very important low-@xmath1 regions are not covered by the data .",
    "for instance , for phenix the lowest pion point is at @xmath96 gev / c , the lowest kaon one at @xmath97 gev / c and the proton and antiproton data start at @xmath98 gev / c @xcite .",
    "therefore , to obtain integrated yields some extrapolations outside the measured ranges are used .",
    "in fact these extrapolations are only analytical fits without any physical reasoning , but , for instance , contributions from regions covered by them account for @xmath99 of the yield for pions , @xmath100 for kaons and @xmath101 for protons and antiprotons for rhic at @xmath0 gev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a calorimeter acts very effectively for these species in the low-@xmath1 range , namely pions with @xmath102 gev / c , kaons with @xmath103 gev / c and protons and antiprotons with @xmath104 gev / c deposit all their kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "second , it is impossible to check the consistency of the transverse energy data because not all stable hadron spectra are measured at midrapidity for each collision case .",
    "this mainly concerns neutrons and @xmath8 . since the good predictions for the transverse energy density at midrapidity have been obtained ( see figs .",
    "[ fig.7]-[fig.8 ] ) , the present studies can be understood as an undirect proof that in these unmeasurable @xmath1 regions spectra are also explicable by means of the thermal source with flow and decays .",
    "this has been also confirmed directly in the phenix case by the extension of the theoretical momentum distributions to the region of the very low transverse momentum covered by the phobos detector ( 0.03 - 0.05 gev for pions , 0.09 - 0.13 gev for kaons and 0.14 - 0.21 gev for protons and antiprotons ) , see fig .  [ fig.4 ] .",
    "having compared the present results with the preliminary ones @xcite , one can notice that substantial improvement has been achieved for the phenix case at @xmath6 gev .",
    "in the previous analysis the behavior of the estimates of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is very irregular in the region from peripheral to mid - central collisions and does not give the evidence for any clear dependence on the centrality . here the dependence of predictions is exactly the same as the dependence of the data , only for @xmath3 the underestimation of at most @xmath105 has been obtained .",
    "but the main success of this final analysis is the prediction of the scaling of the total charged - particle multiplicity with the number of participants for all considered cases , which failed in the studies based on the preliminary fits from @xcite .    as the next point",
    ", the possible description of the hbt radii within the single - freeze - out model will be briefly discussed ( for a general review of the hbt interferometry see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "this problem needs some comments since the hbt analysis also gives information about the size of the hadron source .",
    "studies of the hbt radii in the single - freeze - out model have been already done for the phenix data at @xmath0 gev @xcite .",
    "it has turned out that the values of the estimated radii are about 30 % smaller then the measured ones .",
    "this discrepancy has been improved by the introduction of the excluded - volume corrections for the hadron gas , in the way as postulated in ref .",
    "the corrections give rise to the appearance of a new common scale factor , denoted as @xmath106 , in the invariant distribution , eq .",
    "( [ cooper2 ] ) .",
    "this simply rescales both geometric parameters @xmath21 and @xmath20 by the factor @xmath107 , _",
    "i.e. _ after fitting spectra @xmath108 and @xmath109 have the same values as @xmath21 and @xmath20 obtained for the point - like gas and listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the value @xmath110 has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite what implies the increase of @xmath21 and @xmath20 by 30 % . with these new rescaled parameters",
    "the predicted values of the hbt radii agree fairly well with the data @xcite .",
    "of course the detailed analysis of the hbt radii in the context of the single - freeze - out model for the final rhic data at @xmath6 gev should be performed and this will be the subject of further investigations .    finally , it should be notice that the statistical model of the present analysis corresponds to the chemical equilibrium case of the more general statistical hadronization model applied in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for a comprehensive review of the model see @xcite ) . in some sense",
    "this analysis is complementary to those studies , because the estimates of statistical parameters from there have been taken as the input here and good quality fits have been obtained .",
    "also the qualitative agreement between independent estimates of the volume of the hadron source done in both works has been obtained , _ cf . _ table  [ table2 ] .",
    "but as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the assumption of the strange quark non - equilibrium and further also the light quark non - equilibrium leads to more thorough description of particle yields for all accessible centralities of phenix measurements at @xmath6 gev . therefore such generalization of the present model should be done and tested with the data and this will be the subject of the next publication .    to summarize , the single freeze - out version of a statistical ( equilibrium ) model fairly well explains the measured spectra of identified hadrons for various centralities and the centrality dependence of transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity pseudo - rapidity densities at mid - rapidity observed at rhic .",
    "the fact which should be stressed again is that this model predicts the centrality independence of the total charged - particle multiplicity .",
    "also predicted values of the total charged - particle multiplicity per participating pair agree with the measured ones within @xmath93 .",
    "this is remarkable since geometric parameters have been fitted to spectra measured at _ midrapidity _ but the total charged - particle multiplicity deals with _ the whole rapidity range_.      99 d.  prorok , eur .",
