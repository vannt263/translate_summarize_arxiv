    "while the nature and even the number of spiral arms in the milky way is still debated , mounting evidence suggests that the perseus arm is one of two major spiral arms  .",
    "it may emerge from the far end of the bar and wrap through the inner galaxy in the first quadrant ( inner portion of the perseus arm ) and the outer galaxy in the second and third quadrants ( outer portion of the perseus arm ) . since the inner portion of the perseus arm lies at a smaller galactic radius and closer to the bar than the outer portion of the arm",
    ", one would expect it to be more prominent in molecular gas and star formation , yet very little is known about it owing to its great distance and its kinematic blending with nearer material in the inner galaxy .",
    "recent improvements in radio astrometry with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques have yielded parallaxes and proper motions to star - forming regions in the galaxy with accuracies of @xmath5 10  and @xmath5 0.1 , respectively ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "parallax measurements for a reasonably dense sampling of sources in spiral arms will help us to fully trace the spiral structure of the galaxy . to reach this goal , we are using the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) to conduct a key science project , the bessel ( bar and spiral structure legacy ) survey , to study the structure and kinematics of the galaxy by measuring trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for hundreds of 22 ghz  and 6.7/12.2 ghz  maser sources associated with massive star - forming regions .    in this paper , we present trigonometric parallax measurements of 22 ghz  masers toward two high - mass star - forming regions , w49n ( ) and , in the inner portion of the perseus arm .",
    "our observations of 22 ghz  masers toward  and , together with several compact extragalactic radio sources , were carried out under vlba program br145b with 12 epochs spanning about one year .",
    "for these sources , the parallax signature in declination was considerably smaller than for right ascension , and we scheduled the observations so as to maximize the right ascension parallax offsets as well as to minimize correlations among the parallax and proper motion parameters .",
    "the observations near each right ascension parallax peak were grouped as listed in table  [ tab : obs ] . at each epoch , the observations consisted of four 0.5-hour `` geodetic blocks '' ( used to calibrate and remove unmodeled atmospheric signal delays ) , with three 1.7-hour periods of phase - referenced observations inserted between the blocks . in the phase - referenced observations , we cycled between the target maser and several background sources , switching sources every 20 to 30 seconds",
    ". table  [ tab : src ] lists the observed source positions , intensities , source separations , reference maser radial velocities and restoring beams .",
    "the typical on - source integration time per epoch for the maser source and each background source were 0.64 and 0.30 hour for , and 0.79 and 0.25 hour for , respectively .",
    "our general observing setup and calibration procedures are described in @xcite ; here we discuss only aspects of the observations that are specific to the maser sources presented in this paper .",
    "we used four adjacent intermediate frequency ( if ) bands with 16 mhz , each in both right and left circular polarization ( rcp and lcp ) ; the second band contained the maser signals , the center  is 10 and 26  for  and , respectively .",
    "the spectral - channel spacing was 31.25 khz corresponding to 0.42  in velocity .",
    "we observed three international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) sources : 3c345 ( j2253 + 1608 ) , 3c454 ( j1642 + 3948 ) and j1925 + 2106  @xcite , near the beginning , middle and end of the phase - referencing observations in order to monitor delay and electronic phase differences among the observing bands .",
    "the data correlation was performed with the difx software correlator @xcite in socorro , nm . the data reduction was conducted using the nrao s astronomical image processing system ( ) together with scripts written in parseltongue @xcite . since in our case the masers are much stronger than the background sources , we used a spectral channel with strong and relatively compact maser emission as the interferometer phase reference .",
    "this is necessary to extend the coherence time of the interferometer and allow all data to be used to make an image .",
    "this allows us to detect weak background sources and other maser spots in many spectral channels in order to determine their positions respect to the reference maser spot . when differencing the positions of the other maser spots and the background sources , structure in the reference spot cancels and as such does not affect parallax measurements .",
    "after we performed the calibration for the polarized bands separately , we combined the rcp and lcp bands to form stokes i and imaged the continuum emission of the background sources from the four frequency bands simultaneously using the  task _",
    "imagr_. for the masers , we also formed stokes i and then imaged the emission in each spectral channel .",
    "then , we fitted elliptical gaussian brightness distributions to the images of strong maser spots and the background sources using the  task _ sad _ or _ jmfit_.",
    "data used for parallax and proper motion fits were residual position differences between maser spots and background sources in eastward (= @xmath6 ) and northward (  = @xmath7 ) directions .",
    "these residual position differences are relative to the coordinates used to correlate the vlba data and shifts applied in calibration .",
    "the data were modeled by the parallax sinusoid in both coordinates ( determined by a single parameter , the parallax ) and a linear proper motion in each coordinate . because systematic errors ( owing to small uncompensated atmospheric delays and , in some cases , varying maser and calibrator source structures ) typically dominate over thermal noise when measuring relative source positions , we added `` error floors '' in quadrature to the formal position uncertainties .",
    "we used different error floors for the  and  data and adjusted them to yield post - fit residuals with reduced @xmath8 near unity for both coordinates .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the apparent motions of the maser spots can be complicated by a combination of spectral and spatial blending and changes in intensity .",
    "thus , for parallax fitting , one needs to find stable , unblended spots and preferably use many maser spots to average out these effects .",
    "we selected maser spots brighter than 50 and 1 , which are @xmath9 1/200 of the peak brightness , for  and , respectively .",
    "we considered maser spots at different epochs as being from the same feature if their separation from the middle - epoch position was less than 5 mas ( a @xmath10 5 mas shift over 0.5 years corresponds to a maser spot motion of @xmath10 260  at a distance of 11 kpc ) .",
    "masers can be time - variable with lifetimes of months to years . for solid",
    "parallax fits , we selected only maser spots persisting over all epochs to avoid large correlations between parallax and proper motion .",
    "we first fitted a parallax and proper motion to each maser spot relative to each background source separately . since one expects the same parallax for all maser spots , we did a combined solution ( fitting with a single parallax parameter for all maser spots , but allowing for different proper motions for each maser spot ) using all maser spots and background sources .    in general ,  maser spots",
    "usually are not distributed uniformly around the exciting star and their kinematics can be complicated by a combination of expansion and rotation @xcite ; this limits the accuracy of estimates of the absolute proper motion of the exciting star(s ) .",
    "therefore , we modeled the _ relative _ motions of maser spots distributed across the source in order to solve for the motion of the phase - reference spot relative to the central star .",
    "owing to the large field of view of the maser spots , especially in , for measuring relative motions we used only the inner - five antennas of the vlba ( to allow a wide field of view and to limit the number of pixels needed to map the sources ) .    in order to model the expansion and rotation of the entire maser source , we adopted a bayesian fitting procedure using a markov chain monte carlo method to explore parameter space , assuming the probability distribution for the data uncertainties follows the `` conservative formulation '' of @xcite , which does not have a large penalty for out - lying data points ( i.e. , maser spots whose motions do not follow the simple expanding model ) .",
    "the details on the maser kinematics model and the bayesian fitting procedure are described in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we first used a simple radial expanding outflow model ( model a ) and then an expanding outflow with rotation ( model b ) .",
    "the global parameters we estimated include the position @xmath11 and motion ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) of the expansion center ( relative to the reference maser spot ) ; the  of the expansion center @xmath14 ; an expansion speed @xmath15 at 1  radius from the expansion center and the exponent @xmath16 that allows for acceleration as a power law for velocity as a function of distance from the expansion center ; and the rotation speed at 1  radius from the spin axis with two orientation angles of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the azimuth and elevation of the spin axis in the reference frame of the model , respectively .",
    "in addition to the global parameters , for each maser spot we estimated its offset along the line of sight from the reference maser spot .",

    "the quoted parallax uncertainty is the formal fitting error multiplied by @xmath20 , assuming conservatively 100% correlated position uncertainties among the spots .",
    "our distance to w49n is consistent with that of @xmath21 kpc obtain by @xcite by modeling the expansion ( basically comparing maser doppler velocities and proper motions ) . combining the data for the two background sources , we measured the absolute proper motion of the reference maser spot to be  = 4.49 @xmath2 0.13  and  = 6.42 @xmath2 0.12 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in order to model the internal motions of the masers to obtain the motion of the exciting star(s ) , we used 345 maser spots which appeared at four or more epochs within one year , and estimated their motions with respective to the reference maser spot . figure  [ fig : g043_ipm ] shows the motions with their mean value removed , which indicates an expansion originating from a small region that might include one ( or more ) young stellar object(s ) , as suggested by @xcite .",

    "we note that the difference in proper motions of a maser spot provided by different background sources are larger than their formal errors for the individual fits .",

    "similar to the kinematic modeling of w49n , we fitted the data to expansion models with and without rotation .",
    "the estimated parameters are listed in table  [ tab : fit_g048 ] .",
    "owing to the large uncertainty of the parameters for rotation , we adopted the results from model a. the proper motion of the expansion center relative to the reference maser spot corresponds to  = 0.30 @xmath2 0.08  and  = 0.11 @xmath2 0.08  at a distance of 10.7 kpc .",

    "velocity information ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the large velocity offset might be the result of the multiple sn explosions in w51 .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with n - body simulations by @xcite , which suggest that the acceleration by the sn explosion does not cause motions of that magnitude for swept - up , star - forming gas .",
    "generally there is excellent agreement between parallaxes measured by different vlbi arrays .",
    "what could explain this unusual difference ?",
    "our vlba parallax measurement has some superiorities over those of @xcite .",
    "firstly , our observations have longer interferometric baselines .",
    "secondly , our observations have more and closer background sources , nearly symmetrically distributed relative to the target as shown in figure  [ fig : srcpos ] .",
    "this could be very important to reduce systematic error due to unmodeled tropospheric delays .",
    "note that the background sources used by nagayama are very close together and both are offset mostly north of .",
    "therefore , unmodeled tropospheric delays will be similar for both of their background sources .",
    "noting this source of correlation , as well as the nearly 100% correlation among different maser spot positions , owing to nearly identical unmodeled tropospheric delays , the ( formal ) parallax uncertainty quoted by nagayama of @xmath40 mas , may be underestimated by factors of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( for 9 maser spots and 2 background sources ) and more realistically is @xmath43 mas .",
    "however , even with this uncertainty , the difference between our and nagayama s parallaxes ( @xmath44 ) is still somewhat significant .",
    "thirdly , our observing epochs symmetrically sample the peaks of the sinusoidal parallax signature in right ascension , yielding near - zero correlation coefficients between parallax and proper motion terms .",
    "for these reasons , we suspect that our measured distance of 10.75@xmath38 kpc to  is more reliable .      as shown in figure  [ fig : pitch_ang ]",
    ", we have yet to locate a high - mass star forming region with @xmath28 between @xmath9 30  and 80  in the perseus arm . although we observed sources whose sky positions and velocities suggested kinematic distances in the perseus arm , all were found to be much closer and located in the local arm  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : mw_maser ] , we plot the galactic plane locations ( based on kinematic distances ) of @xmath9 200 22-ghz  masers stronger than 10 jy and associated with star - forming regions .",
    "we find that the section of the perseus arm between @xmath29 50  to 80  near the solar circle has very few 22 ghz candidate  masers , even though they are numerous masers outside the solar circle in the perseus arm for @xmath45 90 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : per_lv ] , co emission indicates that the perseus arm can be seen from @xmath29 180to 48 , where it spirals to the solar circle and  values approach zero and merge with local emission . the longitude range 64",
    "to 76  is weak in co emission ( as it is from 160  to 168 ) .",
    "this suggests that the perseus arm , at least between @xmath29 64  and 76 , is low in giant molecular clouds and massive star formation .",
    "also plotted is the galactic distribution of massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) from the red msx sources ( rms ) survey .",
    "since mysos are indicators of star formation , the small numbers of mysos at 50  @xmath3 80  also indicates low levels of star formation in this portion of the perseus arm .",

    "these two sources have positions and s that match  emission from giant molecular clouds that are located in the perseus arm .",
    "thus , our parallax distances accurately locate the inner portion of the perseus arm within the milky way . combining our results with other parallax measurements for maser sources associated with the outer portion of the perseus arm , we determined a global pitch angle of 9.3  @xmath2 1.3  for the perseus arm . finally , we suggest that there is little massive - star formation in the perseus arm between @xmath46  and 80 .",
