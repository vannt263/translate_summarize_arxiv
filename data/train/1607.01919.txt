    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) is at the heart of magnetic properties of materials .",
    "it is of crucial importance from the fundamental or technological point of views since it provides an energy scale for the stability of magnetic domains where for example magnetic information is stored . when the mae is large and favors an out - of - plane orientation of the magnetic moments , perpendicular magnetic recording or magneto - optical recording is possible ( see e.g. refs@xcite ) .",
    "copt binary bulk alloy in the * l1@xmath0 * structure ( see fig.[cell_bulk ] ) is by now a classical example of a material exhibiting a large perpendicular mae , around 1 mev  @xcite .",
    "there has been a tremendous number of studies related to the magnetic properties of this alloy in its bulk phase , as nanoparticles or in nanostructures combining co and pt ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    * alloy .",
    "the primitive cell is also sketched using dashed lines . ]    a large amount of work has been devoted to unveil the origin of the large perpendicular mae in binary bulk alloys , see e.g. refs@xcite .",
    "the interplay of the tetragonality of the alloy , band filling , hybridization between the constituents affect certainly the magnitude of the mae .",
    "for instance , tetragonality leads to the lifting of the degeneracy of the electrons by the tetragonal crystal field and produces thereby an additional contribution to the mae .",
    "thus , and as expected from perturbation theory , the mae becomes proportional to @xmath1 instead of @xmath2 as found for cubic symmetry , where @xmath3 is the spin - orbit coupling constant .",
    "indeed , in cubic bulk systems , the high symmetry allows only for a fourth - order anisotropy constant , and thus they are characterized by a small mae .",
    "razee et al.@xcite argued however that the tetragonal distortion of copt , given by the axial ration c / a = 0.98 , contributes by only 15% of the mae .",
    "it was then concluded that the compositional order of the alloy is an important ingredient for a large mae .",
    "sakuma@xcite shows that by changing the axial ratio ( c / a ) defining the tetragonality of copt and fept alloys , the mae first smoothly decreases by increasing c / a till reaching a minimum at @xmath40.8 before a smooth increase in magnitude .",
    "interestingly , except a small window of axial ratios ( @xmath5 ) , the mae favors an out - of - plane orientation of the magnetic moments .",
    "the tetragonalization is then thought to provide an effect similar to the band filling@xcite .    in the context of thin films ,",
    "zhang et al.@xcite demonstrated with ab - initio simulations that for copt films terminated by co layers , a thickness of at least 9 monolayers exhibit a rather converged mae , with a bulk contribution of 1.36 mev favoring a perpendicular orientation of the magnetic moments and a counter - acting surface contribution of -0.76 mev favoring , interestingly , an in - plane orientation of the moments .",
    "their interest in copt was motivated by the experimental demonstration of coercivity manipulation of * l1@xmath0 * fept and fepd thin films@xcite by external electric field .",
    "their ab - initio simulations predicted a higher sensitivity of copt to electric field than that of fept films .",
    "pustogowa et al.@xcite investigated from first - principles several components made of co and pt deposited on pt(100 ) and pt(111 ) surfaces .",
    "they found that ordered superstructures of ( copt)@xmath6 deposited on both mentioned substrates are characterized by a perpendicular mae , which is heavily affected by chemical disorder in line with the analysis of razee et al.@xcite .",
    "the goal of this manuscript is to present a systematic ab - initio investigation on the effect of reduced dimensionality on the magnetic properties of copt(100 ) films with a focus on their mae and by addressing the impact of the termination type of the films .",
    "contrary to previous investigations@xcite , we consider not only co - terminated films but also pt - terminated films and several types of surface defects ( see fig.[cell_surf ] ) .",
    "for instance , we found that decreasing the thickness of the films leads to a sign change of the surface mae .",
    "pt covered thin films can boost the total perpendicular mae by a large amount stabilizing , thereby , more strongly the out - of - plane orientation of the moments .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the likeliness of having pt on the surface of copt alloy@xcite and thus the pertinence of our predictions .",
    "after a careful study of different defective terminations types ( stacking faults , anti - site defects ) , we provide the ingredient to increase the mae of the thin films .",
    "if we label the co and pt layers by respectively a and b , the perfect stacking along the [ 001 ] direction is given for example by ababab for 6 layers .",
    "possible stacking faults , which are planar defects , could be the sequence ababaa ( see figs.[cell_surf](c - d ) ) .",
    "anti - site defects on the surface means that instead of having at the surface a pure layer a , or layer b , we have an alloy , for example , made of a and b. in our work , we considered an alloy of the type a@xmath7b@xmath8 in the surface layer instead of the perfect b layer of our example ( see figs.[cell_surf](e - f ) ) .",
    "we simulate the thin films by adopting the slab approach with periodic boundary conditions in two directions while the periodic images in the third direction are separated by a sufficient amount of vacuum ( 15   ) to avoid interaction between neighboring supercells .",
    "we have chosen to use symmetrical calculation cells with an odd number of planes to avoid the pulay stress .",
    "some representative slabs are shown in fig.[cell_surf ] . here",
    "it can be observed that for equiatomic * l1@xmath0 * type of alloys two different surfaces exist when the slabs are stacked along the [ 001 ] direction . in the perfect cases ,",
    "the surface termination can be made of either purely co atoms or pt atoms .",
    "the self - consistent calculations are carried out with the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) using a plane wave basis and the projector augmented wave ( paw ) approach  @xcite . the exchange - correlation potential is used in the functional from of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite .",
    "the cut - off energies for the plane waves is 478 ev .",
    "the integration over the brillouin zone was based on finite temperature smearing ( methfessel - paxton method ) for the thin films while for the bulk case the tetrahedron method with blchl corrections has been used .",
    "the k - points grids are @xmath9 for the bulk calculation , and @xmath10 for the ( 001 ) surface calculations .",
    "the energy convergence criterion is set to @xmath11 ev while the geometrical atomic relaxations for the surfaces calculations were stopped when the forces were less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the mae is extracted from the difference between the total energies of the two configurations : out - of - plane versus in - plane orientations of the magnetic moments .",
    "a positive value indicates a preference for the out - of - plane orientation of the magnetic moments .",
    "copt alloy as function of the axial ratio c / a under constant volume .",
    "two possible in - plane orientation of the magnetic moments are considered , [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] , but the obtained mae are very similar .",
    "the closed circle represents the experimental value@xcite , which is well reproduced by our simulations .",
    "other experimental values can be 50% larger , see e.g. ref .",
    "to start our investigations , we revisited the bulk alloy phase by finding the tetragonal lattice structure minimizing its energy .",
    "the optimal value of c / a ratio is equal to 0.984 with a lattice parameter value a of 3.80  , in good agreement with values available in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments ( @xmath12 = 1.91 @xmath13 , @xmath14 = 0.40 @xmath13 ) are also in line with previous works  @xcite .",
    "we also note the well - known emergence of an induced moment in pt , which is due to the hybridization of its 5d orbitals with the exchange splitted 3d orbitals of co. in order to calculate the mae , we considered two possible directions for the in - plane moments orientations , [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] , and we found a negligible difference in the obtained perpendicular mae . for the optimized structure ,",
    "the mae reaches a value of 0.91 mev when the in - plane orientation of moments is along [ 100 ] and 0.97 mev for [ 110 ] as an in - plane orientation of the moments .",
    "both values are close to the experimental values that are given around 1 mev  @xcite .    in fig.[mae_bulk ]",
    ", we plot the bulk mae as function of the ratio c / a under the constant unit cell volume in a similar fashion then that of sakuma  @xcite .",
    "the obtained curve agrees well with the one published in the latter article . for ratios between 0.6 and 1.2 , the mae experiences one minimum and two maxima .",
    "the largest in - plane mae is found for a ratio of 0.8 . as expected , if c / a = @xmath15 , i.e. c / a@xmath16 = 1 , the mae drops to zero since this corresponds to a primitive cell of the cubic b2 structure . as discussed by sakuma , upon tetragonalization , the electronic states of the atoms are shifted and the band filling changes , which affect the magnitude and sign of the mae .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     another path for the analysis of the calculated maes is to use of the celebrated bruno s formula  @xcite , which translates to the neglect of spin - flip contributions to the mae as given in eq.[mae_perturbation ] : @xmath17 } } - l^i_{\\mathrm{[100]}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 labels the different atoms , and @xmath19 being the orbital magnetic moment calculated when the spin magnetic moment points along the [ 100 ] or the [ 001 ] directions .",
    "the essence of bruno s formula is to relate the mae to the orbital moment anisotropy ( oma ) , i.e. @xmath20 } } - l_{\\mathrm{[001]}}$ ] , and leads to the conclusion that the orientation of the magnetic moments is favored when the orbital magnetic moment is maximized .",
    "this formula is known to work reasonably well when the majority - spin states are occupied .",
    "thus , its validity is probably limited to some of the co atoms discussed in this manuscript but certainly not for pt .",
    "it is however instructive to analyze the results obtained with this well known formulation since it should correlate with the previous discussion . in fig.[anisotropy_orbital](a ) , the omas in the bulk of copt is plotted for co and pt as function of the c / a ratio in fashion similar to that used in fig.[mae_bulk ] .",
    "one notices that the pt contribution counteracts the one of co. while the anisotropy of the co orbital moment increases with c / a , favoring thereby an out - of - plane orientation of the magnetic moment , the anisotropy of the pt orbital moment has an opposite slope and favors an in - plane orientation of the magnetic moment . when summing up the two curves , considering the spin - orbit coupling constant , @xmath3 , to be the same for co and pt , which is of course is not true since @xmath21 is one order of magnitude larger than @xmath22 , one recovers the shape of the curve obtained in fig,[mae_bulk ] , i.e. having a minimum of the curve at c / a = 0.8 .",
    "similar to the bulk , the behavior of the co and pt oma in copt thin films counteract each other .",
    "in general , the co oma favors an out - of - plane orientation of the moment contrary to the pt oma . in fig.[anisotropy_orbital](b ) , we plot the surface mae of the thin films characterized by @xmath23 as function of the pt concentration on the layer deposited on the co - terminated thin film . thus ,",
    "in the case of one perfect pt overlayer the pt concentration is 100% , while the investigated anti - site corresponds to a pt concentration of 50% .",
    "for the specific case of co stacking fault , the pt concentration is -100% .",
    "the surface mae seems to increase with the pt concentration but not in a regular manner .",
    "we plot on the same figure the average co oma per co atom and find that this quantity increases smoothly in magnitude with pt concentration .",
    "in addition the contribution of the average pt oma per pt atom is shown in fig.[anisotropy_orbital](b ) .",
    "the pt oma seems to correlate the irregular behavior of the surface mae .",
    "interestingly , we find that thin films with large pt oma per pt atom compared to the co oma leads to an in - plane surface mae",
    ". only the pt - terminated thin film , with a large perpendicular surface mae , is characterized by a large co oma .",
    "we investigated from ab - initio the magnetic behavior of copt thin films as function of thickness considering different types of terminations : perfect co or pt layers or different types of defects : anti - site or stacking faults .",
    "after this systematic study , we found that the mae is the largest when the thin films are terminated by a perfect pt overlayer .",
    "surprisingly in the latter case , the mae can be 1000% times larger than the one of co - terminated thin films .",
    "we also find that all types of investigated defects reduce dramatically the mae .",
    "the surface mae experiences a sign change when increasing the thickness of several investigated films . except for the pt - terminated films",
    ", the surface mae favors an in - plane orientation of the moments when the thickness @xmath24 is smaller then four .",
    "we proceeded to an analysis of the electronic structure of the thin films with a careful comparison to the copt bulk case and related the behavior of the mae to the location of the different virtual bound states utilizing second order perturbation theory .",
    "finally , the correlation between the mae and the oma is studied .",
