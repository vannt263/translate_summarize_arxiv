    "atmospheres of hot luminous stars and accretion disks in active galactic nuclei and cataclysmic variables form extensive outflows due to super - eddington radiation fluxes in uv resonance and subordinate lines .",
    "an understanding of these winds is hampered by the pathological dependence of the driving force on the flow velocity gradient .",
    "castor , abbott , & klein ( 1975 ; cak hereafter ) found that line - driven winds ( hereafter ldws ) from o  stars should adopt a unique , critical state which corresponds to maximum mass loss rate .",
    "the equation of motion for a 1-d , spherically symmetric , polytropic outflow subject to a sobolev line force allows for two infinite families of so - called shallow and steep solutions .",
    "however , none of these families can provide for a _",
    "solution alone .",
    "shallow solutions do not reach infinity , while steep solutions do not extend into the subsonic regime including the photosphere .",
    "the critical wind starts then as the fastest shallow solution and switches at the critical point in a continuous and differentiable manner to the slowest steep solution .",
    "hence the critical point and not the sonic point determines the bottleneck in the wind . this description in principle applies equally to winds from stars and accretion disks .",
    "a physical interpretation of the cak critical point was given by abbott ( 1980 ) , who derived a new type of radiative - acoustic waves ( hereafter abbott waves ) .",
    "these waves can propagate inward , in the stellar rest frame , only from below the cak critical point . above the critical point , they are advected outwards .",
    "hence , the cak critical point serves as an information barrier , much as the sonic or alfvn points in thermal and hydromagnetic winds .",
    "analysis was challenged by owocki & rybicki ( 1986 ) who found for a pure absorption ldw the signal speed to be the sound speed and not the much faster abbott speed . as noted already by these authors",
    ", this should be a consequence of assuming pure line absorption , which does not allow for any radiatively modified , inward wave mode .",
    "meanwhile there is ample evidence for abbott waves in time - dependent wind simulations ( owocki & puls 1999 ) .",
    "shallow solutions fail to reach infinity because they can not perform the required spherical expansion work , implying that the flow starts to decelerate .",
    "since this usually occurs very far out in the wind , the local wind speed is much larger than the local escape speed , and the wind escapes to infinity .",
    "thus , a simple generalization of the cak model allowing for flow deceleration renders shallow solutions globally admissible .",
    "this raises a fundamental question of why the wind would adopt the critical solution at all , and attain the critical mass loss rate and velocity law , as proposed by cak .    in this letter",
    "we analyze a physical mechanism which drives shallow solutions towards the critical one , and discuss under what conditions this evolutions does not terminate at the cak solution , but continues into the realm of overloaded solutions .",
    "we find that simulations so far were affected by numerical runaway towards the critical solution , by not accounting for abbott waves in the courant time step .",
    "abbott waves are readily derived by bringing the wind equations into characteristic form .",
    "we consider a 1-d planar wind of velocity @xmath0 and density @xmath1 , assuming zero sound speed .",
    "the continuity and euler equation are , @xmath2 @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are gravity and radiative flux , respectively .",
    "the cak line force is given by @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 ) , with constant @xmath8 and exponent @xmath9 .",
    "the unique , stationary cak wind , @xmath10 , is found by requiring a critical point at some @xmath11 .",
    "the number of solutions for @xmath12 changes from 2 to 1 at @xmath11 ( which is a saddle point ) , hence @xmath13 holds .",
    "writing @xmath8 in terms of critical point quantities , the euler equation becomes ,    @xmath14 @xmath15 note that for stationary planar winds , @xmath16 is constant . if , in addition , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are taken constant with height , and @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath20 , with normalized mass loss rate @xmath21 , one finds that @xmath22 does no longer depend explicitly on @xmath23 for stationary solutions .",
    "hence , @xmath24 is independent of @xmath23 , too .",
    "this implies that @xmath11 is ill - defined , and every point of the cak solution is a critical point .",
    "cak removed this degeneracy by introducing gas pressure terms . here",
    "we take a different approach and assume @xmath25 . a situation with roughly constant radiative flux and gravity showing a maximum at finite height",
    "could be encountered above isothermal disks around compact objects ( cf . feldmeier & shlosman 1999 ) .",
    "the critical point is determined by the regularity condition , @xmath26 , hence @xmath27 and the critical point coincides with the gravity maximum . for simplicity",
    "also we chose @xmath28 from now on , which is reasonably close to realistic values @xmath29 ( puls et al .",
    "none of our results should depend qualitatively on the assumptions made so far .",
    "the euler equation is @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the stationary solutions for wind acceleration are given by @xmath32 where plus and minus signs refer to steep and shallow solutions , respectively .",
    "for @xmath33 , shallow and steep solutions are globally , i.e. , everywhere , defined . for @xmath34 , solutions are called _ overloaded _ , and become imaginary in a neighborhood of the gravity maximum .",
    "these winds carry too large mass loss rates and eventually stagnate .",
    "next we put the euler equation into quasi - linear form , which does _ not _ mean to linearize it .",
    "differentiating @xmath22 with respect to @xmath23 ( courant & hilbert 1962 ; abbott 1980 ) and introducing @xmath35 , eqs .",

    "individual spatial and temporal variations are much larger than the inhomogeneous term @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ charaeul ] ) , and the latter can be neglected .",
    "consequently , @xmath39 is a riemann invariant propagating at characteristic speed @xmath40 .",
    "perturbations of @xmath39 correspond to the amplitude of a wave propagating at phase speed @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath39 is proportional to the sobolev line optical depth , indicating that this wave is a true radiative mode .",
    "the second characteristic is determined by the continuity equation ( [ characon ] ) . in the advection operator in square brackets",
    ", @xmath41 has to be read as @xmath42 in the zero - sound speed limit .",
    "this outwards propagating invariant corresponds to a sound wave , with amplitude @xmath43 scaling with gas pressure .    at the critical point , @xmath44 and @xmath45 after eq .",
    "( [ windsol ] ) , hence @xmath46 ( where we introduced @xmath47 ) .",
    "abbott waves stagnate at the critical point , in analogy with sound waves at the sonic point . for shallow solutions , @xmath48 and @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ windsol ] ) , hence @xmath50 .",
    "shallow ldw solutions are therefore the subcritical analog to solar wind breezes .",
    "because in the rest frame , the inward abbott mode can propagate at larger absolute speeds than the outward sound mode , abbott waves can determine the courant time step in time - explicit hydrodynamic simulations . violating the courant step results in numerical instability . despite this fact",
    ", abbott waves along shallow solutions were never considered in the literature .",
    "we turn our attention to a physical mechanism which can drive ldws away from shallow solutions , and towards the critical one . starting from an arbitrary shallow solution as initial condition",
    ", we explicitly introduce perturbations at some fixed location in the wind and study their evolution . in order to keep _ unperturbed",
    "_ shallow solutions stable in numerical simulations , we fix one outer boundary condition , according to inward propagating abbott waves .",
    "either a constant mass loss rate at the outer boundary or non - reflecting boundary conditions ( hedstrom 1977 ) serve this aim . at the inner , subcritical boundary",
    ", we also fix one boundary condition , according to incoming sound waves .",
    "non - reflecting boundary conditions and @xmath51 give similar results .",
    "wind convergence towards the critical solution is then triggered by negative flow velocity gradients .",
    "allowing for @xmath52 turns the inward abbott mode of phase speed @xmath50 in the rest frame into an outwards propagating mode .",
    "this is readily seen for a line force which is zero for negative @xmath53 , i.e. , when all photons are absorbed at a resonance location between the photosphere and the wind point .",
    "the euler equation simplifies to that for an ordinary gas , with characteristic speed @xmath54 in the zero sound speed limit . at the other extreme , for a purely local line force where the unattenuated stellar or disk radiation field reaches the wind point , @xmath55 . here",
    "the abbott phase speed is found to be @xmath40 , with @xmath56 for @xmath52 .",
    "consider then a sawtooth - like velocity perturbation ( sinusoidal perturbation lead to similar results ) .",
    "slopes @xmath57 propagate inwards , slopes @xmath52 propagate outwards . hence , as a kinematical consequence , a sawtooth which is initially symmetric with respect to the underlying stationary velocity law evolves towards larger velocities .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  1 where , in course of time , a periodic sawtooth perturbation is introduced at @xmath58 .",
    "the line force is assumed to be @xmath59 , and the initial shallow solution has @xmath60 .",
    "the figure shows 2@xmath61 perturbation cycles . for upward pointing kinks",
    "the slopes propagate apart and a flat velocity law develops between them . at each time",
    "step @xmath62 , a new increment @xmath63 ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 being the amplitude and period of the sawtooth ) is added at @xmath58 , hence the flattening velocity law does not show up in region a of figure  1 .",
    "overall , the wind speed at the perturbation site evolves towards larger values during these phases . on the other hand ,",
    "for downward pointing kinks of the sawtooth , @xmath66 , the two approaching slopes merge , and the wind speed evolves back towards its unperturbed value after each decrement @xmath67 .",
    "the wind velocity hardly evolves during these phases , cf .",
    "region b of figure  1 . over a full perturbation cycle",
    ", the wind speed clearly increases .",
    "to3.6 in    ' '' ''    essentially any perturbation which introduces negative @xmath53 will accelerate the wind .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbation is rather irrelevant since , with decreasing perturbation wavelength , negative @xmath53 occur at ever smaller amplitudes",
    ". however , in more realistic winds , dissipative effects may smear out short - scale perturbations before they can grow .",
    "details of the physical mechanism will be discussed elsewhere .    _",
    "if _ the perturbation lies downstream from the critical point , the wind converges to the critical solution .",
    "namely , as soon as the perturbation site comes to lie on the supercritical part of the cak solution during its evolution , positive velocity slopes propagate _ outwards _ , and combine with negative slopes to a full wave train .",
    "no information is propagated upstream .",
    "this unconditional stability of the outer cak solution is shown in the lower panel of fig .  1 .",
    "wind runaway towards larger speeds as caused by perturbations introduced _ upstream _ from the critical point does not terminate at the critical cak solution . for low - lying perturbations , communication with the wind base",
    "is still possible once the subcritical branch of the cak solution is reached . the wind gets further accelerated into the domain of mass - overloaded solutions ( where @xmath68 and hence @xmath69 for @xmath70 according to eq .",
    "[ windsol ] ) , until a generalized critical point develops , which prevents inward propagation of abbott waves and adjustment of the mass loss rate .",
    "such generalized critical points are given by ` termination ' points , @xmath71 , of overloaded solutions , where the velocity becomes imaginary . at @xmath71 , the number of real solutions @xmath72 changes from 2 ( shallow and steep ) to 0 .",
    "hence , termination points are defined by the same condition as the cak critical point ( at which the number of solutions changes from 2 via 1 to 2 ) , @xmath73 . from the stationary version of eq .",
    "( [ euler2 ] ) , @xmath74 , hence abbott waves stagnate at termination points , and the latter are generalized critical points .    the fact that perturbations with negative @xmath53 accelerate the wind either to the critical or an overloaded state can be casted into black - hole conjecture ( penrose 1965 ) : a ldw avoids a ` naked ' base , and encloses it with a critical surface .",
    "since to each @xmath71 there corresponds a unique , supercritical mass loss rate , the latter is determined by the perturbation _ location _ alone .",
    "using @xmath74 , one finds @xmath75 for a planar wind with constant radiative flux .    at a termination point",
    ", @xmath24 jumps to the decelerating branch , @xmath76 . beyond a well - defined location above the gravity maximum , the super - cak mass loss rate",
    "can again be lifted by the line force , and @xmath24 jumps back to the accelerating branch .",
    "hence , two stationary kinks occur in the velocity law .",
    "figure  2 shows a hydrodynamic simulation of the evolution towards an overloaded solution .",
    "sawtooth - type velocity perturbations were introduced at @xmath77 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath78 for the overloaded solution , using @xmath25 .",
    "future work has to clarify whether ldws show deep - seated perturbations .",
    "it seems however unlikely that they would occur at a unique location .",
    "hence , overloaded winds should be non - stationary and show a _ range _ of supercritical mass loss rates .",
    "more fundamentally , time - dependent overloaded solutions occur already for single , unique perturbation sites , once the latter lie below a certain height .",
    "for the present wind model , this is at @xmath79 .",
    "the overloading is then so severe and the decelerating region so broad that negative wind speeds result ( cf .",
    "poe , owocki , & castor 1990 ) .",
    "the corresponding mass loss rates are still only a few percent larger than the cak value .",
    "the gas which falls back towards the photosphere collides with outflowing gas , and a time - dependent situation develops . within each perturbation period , a shock forms in the velocity law , supplemented by a dense shell .",
    "these shocks and shells propagate outwards ( feldmeier & shlosman 2000 ) .",
    "although strong perturbations introducing negative velocity gradients can appear already in o  star winds , accretion disk winds are the prime suspects .",
    "the reason for this is that accretion processes and their radiation fields in cataclysmic variables and galactic nuclei are intrinsically variable on a range of timescales ( frank , king , & raine 1992 ) , and that disk ldws are driven by a combination of uncorrelated , local and central radiation fluxes .",
    "we find that shallow solutions to line - driven winds are subcritical with respect to abbott waves ( sub - abbottic ) .",
    "these waves cause shallow solutions to evolve towards larger speeds and mass loss rates because of the asymmetry of the line force with regard to positive and negative velocity gradients and because perturbations with opposite signs of @xmath80 propagate in opposite directions .",
    "steep velocity slopes propagate towards the wind base , steepen the inner wind and lift it to higher mass loss rates . in the presence of enduring wind perturbations",
    ", this proceeds until a critical point forms and abbott waves can no longer penetrate inwards .",
    "the resulting solution does not necessarily correspond to the cak wind . for perturbations which originate below the critical point",
    ", the developing abbott wave barrier is found to be the termination point of a mass - overloaded solution .",
    "the velocity law acquires a kink at the termination point , where the wind starts to decelerate .",
    "whether the wind converges to a critical or overloaded solution depends entirely on the _ location _ of perturbations , and not , e.g. , on boundary conditions at the wind base .",
    "if abbott waves are not accounted for in the courant time step of hydrodynamic simulations , we find that _ numerical _ runaway can drive the solution towards the critical cak wind .",
    "a detailed discussion of this will be given elsewhere .",
    "future work has to clarify whether and where perturbations causing local flow deceleration , @xmath81 , can occur in ldws .",
    "overloaded winds may be detected observationally .",
    "while their mass loss rates should still be close to cak values , broad regions of decelerating flow could be identified in p  cygni line profiles .",
    "furthermore , shocks occurring in overloaded solutions with infalling gas may contribute to the x - ray emission from ldws , besides shocks from the line - driven instability ( lucy 1982 ; owocki et al .",
    "note that the present wind runaway occurs already in the lowest order sobolev approximation , and is therefore , unrelated to the line - driven instability which depends on velocity curvature terms ( feldmeier 1998 ) .",
