    "one important class of courant algebroids , called exact courant algebroids , was discovered by evera  @xcite .",

    "evera and bressler also classified transitive courant algebroids as extensions of transitive lie algebroids  @xcite .",
    "indeed evera also outlined some nice ideas of classification of transitive courant algebroids in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", the second and third authors introduced the modular class of courant algebroids , a degree 1 characteristic class in the naive cohomology @xmath10 of the courant algebroid @xmath7 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there is a degree 3 characteristic class for a general courant algebroid resembling the severa class , and if so , what role is played by such a class in the classification of courant algebroids .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to answer these questions for regular courant algebroids , that is , courant algebroids with a constant rank anchor .",
    "such courant algebroids @xmath7 are particularly easier to handle , for their associated characteristic distributions @xmath11 do not have any singularity .",
    "note that characteristic classes of lie algebroids were studied by evens - lu - weinstein @xcite , crainic and fernandes @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to explore if there is any intrinsic connection between these constructions .    to any regular courant algebroid",

    "the classification problem is much subtler in this case .    given a regular courant algebroid @xmath7 with anchor @xmath9 , @xmath13 is clearly a regular lie algebroid , i.e.  a lie algebroid with a constant rank anchor .",

    "we prove that there is a one - to - one correspondence between regular courant algebroids up to isomorphisms and equivalence classes of characteristic pairs .",

    "we denote the class of the well - known cartan @xmath0-form of lie theory in @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "the main result of the paper can be summarized as the following    1 .",
