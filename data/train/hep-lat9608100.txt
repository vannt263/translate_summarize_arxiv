    "perturbation theory in its original formulation fails beyond @xmath1 in the calculation of the free energy density of non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "very recently braaten @xcite has pointed out that the coefficients of the higher powers in the weak coupling expansion can be determined by invoking non - perturbative information from the effective theory of three - dimensional static magnetic fluctuations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a systematic two - step separation of the perturbatively treatable fluctuations from the static magnetic sector has been proposed . in the first step the full ( electric _ and _ magnetic ) static sector",
    "is represented by an effective three - dimensional theory . in this theory ( called eqcd )",
    "a massive ( @xmath2 ) adjoint scalar field stands for the screened electric fluctuations . in the second step",
    "this theory is matched onto an effective magnetic theory ( mqcd ) with a separation cut - off @xmath3 .",
    "while the contribution of the non - static and static electric modes to the free energy can be safely calculated perturbatively ( expansion parameters are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) , the magnetic sector is still non - perturbative and should be investigated by numerical methods .",
    "this was done by simulating su(3 ) pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions which is just the mqcd .",
    "we also calculated the string tension in this theory and compared it to the 4 dimensional spatial string tension and to a possible magnetic mass .",
    "according to the two step reduction program the high temperature free energy of the full theory can be written as @xmath6    the first term contains all non - static diagrams in the full 4-d theory , while the second term contains the contribution from eqcd .",
    "it can be calculated savely in an expansion in @xmath5 .",
    "the non - perturbative information contained in the third term comes from the minimal mqcd theory .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to present first results of a lattice analysis of mqcd , ie .",
    "the 3-dimensional su(n ) gauge theory .",
    "this does provide the non - perturbative input needed to evaluate the @xmath0 part of @xmath7 , denoted in the following by @xmath8 .    with the lagrangian @xmath9 one",
    "has the following cut - off dependence : @xmath10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first terms are divergent with some power of @xmath3 , but they cancel against analogous terms in the electric sector .",
    "so the numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 carry the interesting finite information and are to be determined in lattice calculations .    on the lattice it is easier to use the internal energy @xmath13 @xmath14 because it is related to the plaquette expectation value @xmath15 .",
    "we expand @xmath15 to identify the relevant term ( @xmath16 ) using the ansatz @xmath17 where the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 are known from lattice perturbation theory .",
    "further we define @xmath20    simulations were performed in 3 dimensional su(2 ) and su(3 ) on @xmath21 resp . @xmath22 lattices with plaquette measurements for @xmath23 $ ] resp . @xmath24 $ ] .",

    "although the su(2 ) data indicate a quadratic behaviour the case i fits were unstable with a free @xmath28 .    from the coefficients",
    "@xmath29 one can then extract @xmath11 by comparing the expansions of @xmath30 and @xmath8 .",
    "the analysis presented above gives the framework to deternine the @xmath31 contribution to the free energy from lattice input . at present the data are not accurate enough to be sensitive for logarithmic corrections .",
    "a calculation of @xmath32 in lattice perturbation theory , which is in principle possible , would , however , improve the analysis .",
    "the @xmath0 contribution is about 10% of the stefan - boltzmann value for @xmath33 , which is in magnitude compatible with the known perturbative contributions .",
    "the contribution of the magnetic sector can be explained with the existence of a pseudo particles with mass @xmath34 and degeneracy @xmath35 .",
    "it would give the following contribution to the energy density : @xmath36    using our fit results we obtain the following gluon masses : @xmath37{ll }      ( 0.397 \\pm 0.008)~g_3 ^ 2 & , \\mbox{su(2 ) , i } \\\\",

    "the motivation to study 3-d string tension and 4-d spatial string tension is twofold : first one wants to know how good the reduction to mqcd works . and",
    "the second question is , to what extent is the non - vanishing spatial string tension related to the magnetic mass ?",
    "this determination of @xmath39 has already been done for su(2 ) and is now repeated for su(3 ) .    in 4 dimensions",
    "a pseudo potential can be extracted from space - like wilson loops . also above @xmath40",
