    "ngc  7771 ( ugc 12815 ) is a very luminous nearby ( v@xmath9 = 4256 km s@xmath10 ) highly inclined ( @xmath1169@xmath12 , smith et al . 1999 ; hereafter s99 ) sba galaxy , which forms a well - known pair with ngc  7770 . at the distance of 56.7 mpc ( h@xmath13 = 75 mpc@xmath10 km s@xmath10 ) 1@xmath4 corresponds to 280 pc . for a large scale view of the pair ,",
    "see e.g. s99 ( their fig .",
    "the optical morphology of ngc  7771 is strongly affected by heavy extinction and prominent dust lanes in the bar .",
    "ngc  7771 is interacting with ngc  7770 and ngc  7771a , as indicated by the h@xmath14 rotation curve ( keel 1993 ) and the hi velocity field ( nordgren et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "there is no sign of a seyfert nucleus in ngc  7771 .",
    "most of the luminosity of ngc  7771 arises from a massive circumnuclear starburst , which was probably triggered by the interaction with ngc  7770 .",
    "nuclear star formation ( sf ) in ngc  7771 is concentrated in an elliptical ring with a major axis of @xmath117@xmath4 ( 2 kpc ) , surrounding the starburst nucleus .",
    "this ring is clumpy and contains several emission regions both in radio ( neff & hutchings 1992 ) and near  infrared ( nir ) continuum ( s99 ) .",
    "s99 noted an anticorrelation between the radio and nir peaks , and explained this by two starburst episodes @xmath1110 myr ( radio regions ) and @xmath11 48 myr ago ( nir regions ) . a lower limit ( 4 myr ) for the age of the starburst has also been estimated from the dominant presence of red supergiants ( rsg ) , based on nir co spectroscopy ( smith et al .",
    "the inner regions of ngc  7771 are also much more luminous in the @xmath15-band than those in normal galaxies ( s99 ) , which can be explained easily if there is a substantial population of rsgs in ngc  7771 .",
    "we present high resolution nir @xmath0 , and for the first time , br@xmath1 and h@xmath3 emission line images of the circumnuclear ring in ngc  7771 .",
    "br@xmath1 emission arises from hii regions surrounding young , hot ob stars , while h@xmath3 10 s(1 ) emission ( hereafter s(1 ) ) arises from hot molecular gas and traces the material available for sf .",
    "the ratio between these two lines can give clues about the excitation mechanism(s ) of the hot molecular gas ( puxley , hawarden & mountain 1990 ) .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    "we discuss the observations and data reduction . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss the evolutionary model used and morphology of the circumnuclear ring and constrain its star forming properties , stellar populations and star forming history by a detailed comparison among the nir tracers and also compare them with the radio emission .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "observations were made in september 1998 with the 3.8 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "seeing during the nights was fwhm 0607 .",
    "we used the 256@xmath16256 pixel ircam3 camera , with pixel size 0281 px@xmath10 and field of view @xmath17 .",
    "ngc   7771 was imaged in the br@xmath1 2.1661  @xmath2 m and h@xmath3 10 s(1 ) 2.122  @xmath2 m spectral lines and in the @xmath0 bands . for the emission line observations , we used cooled ( @xmath18 77 k ) narrow - band filters and a fabry - perot etalon with spectral resolution @xmath11400  km  s@xmath10 and equivalent width 0.0038  @xmath2 m .    for both lines ,",
    "5 one - minute observations were made at each on - line wavelength ( ol ) and at the nearby blue ( bc ) and red ( rc ) continuum , following the sequence ol  bc  ol  rc and moving the telescope by 8@xmath4 between the individual integrations .",
    "a dark frame was obtained for each sequence . for the @xmath0 bands ,",
    "5 one - minute integrations were taken both centered on ngc  7771 and on sky 5@xmath19 east of ngc  7771 , moving the telescope as in the line observations .    _",
    "iraf _ was used to reduce and analyze the observations .",
    "for the line images , a normalized flatfield was made from linearized and dark - subtracted galaxy images .",
    "galaxy frames were then divided by the flatfield and sky - subtracted using the median of the 5 images obtained at the same wavelength .",
    "frames were aligned and merged into one on - line image and two continuum images . since the shape of the nucleus varies with wavelength ,",
    "@xmath0 band images were first registered using a foreground field star .",
    "the emission line and @xmath15 band images were then registered with respect to each other by using the nucleus prior to subtracting the continuum in order to avoid possible rotation and alignment errors .",
    "the final registration of the images is accurate to within a fraction of a pixel .",
    "finally , the continuum images were scaled with the continuum / line ratio measured from observations of a standard star ( hd 225023 ) , combined and subtracted from on - line images , and the final line images were then flux calibrated .",
    "the total on - line integration time was 40 minutes for br@xmath1 and 20 minutes for s(1 ) .",
    "broad - band images were linearized , dark - subtracted , flatfielded using a flatfield made from sky images and sky - subtracted using the median of 5 sky images .",
    "fs 29 ( @xmath15 = 13.346 ) from the faint star catalogue of ukirt , was used for flux calibration and the observed fluxes were corrected for galactic extinction and redshift of ngc  7771 ( k  correction ) .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the fabry - perot was corrected for by dividing the measured fluxes by an airy function ( see e.g. bland ",
    "hawthorn 1995 ) .",
    "both the velocity field of ngc  7771 and the shift in the transmitted wavelength across the array need to be considered",
    ". a high resolution velocity field for ngc  7771 has not been published , but in a lower resolution data ( nordgren et al .",
    "1997 ) the velocity contours are nearly perpendicular to the major axis of the elliptical ring , so the velocity field in the ring was approximated by the 1d h@xmath14 longslit - data ( keel 1996 ) .",
    "the effect of linewidth on the emission line fluxes has not been corrected for because the shape of the lines in the ring is not known .",
    "the observed line emission is weak , so in order to enhance the s / n , all images were smoothed to 1@xmath4 resolution .",
    "the inclined star forming ring with a major axis of @xmath11 7@xmath4 ( 2 kpc at pa @xmath8 90@xmath12 ) is clearly visible in the @xmath15-band image ( figure [ fig:7771bg ] ) .",
    "the nucleus in the middle of the ring is brighter than the circumnuclear regions . in the @xmath20-band and especially in the @xmath21-band , the morphology is different .",
    "the southeastern part of the ring is significantly more conspicuous in the @xmath21-band than in the @xmath15-band and the nucleus appears to merge with the northern part of the ring . in the east the ring is weaker than in the west in all the broad - band images .",
    "these differences in morphology are also clearly visible in the @xmath21@xmath20 color map ( figure [ fig:7771jh ] ) , where the southern and southwestern parts of the ring are redder than other parts , probably due to extinction , rsgs and hot dust .",
    "although the western part of the ring is weaker in the @xmath15-band , almost all br@xmath1 emission arises from there ( figure [ fig:7771bg ] )",
    ". the eastern part of the ring may be older than the western part and supernova ( sn ) remnants may already have dispersed the gas clouds .",
    "because rsgs appear at a later stage in the starburst evolution ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) and then dominate the @xmath15-band emission , the eastern part may indeed be older . even in the west ,",
    "the @xmath15-band peaks do not correlate with the br@xmath1 peaks , but seem to indicate older starburst regions .",
    "there is no br@xmath1 emission source exactly at the nucleus , but @xmath1104 to the north of the nucleus there is a strong s(1 ) source .",
    "the position of this strong s(1 ) peak is affected by smoothing . in the unsmoothed image",
    "the peak pixel is coincident with the nucleus , but emission becomes fainter much faster to the south than to the north .",
    "this may be due to extended emission or an additional emission region north of the nucleus .",
    "we believe that the s(1 ) region marked n is really the nuclear emission which has shifted north during the smoothing .",
    "the position of other emission regions is unaffected by smoothing .",
    "the s(1 ) emission in the ring is distributed more broadly than the br@xmath1 ( figure [ fig:7771bg ] ) , especially in the east , delineating a more complete ring than what is seen in br@xmath1 . neither the correlation between the s(1 ) and @xmath15-band peaks , nor between the s(1 ) and br@xmath1 peaks is perfect , but there is a fair correlation between s(1 ) and @xmath21@xmath20 .",
    "although the ring is incomplete in br@xmath1 , it appears to follow an ellipse with semi - major and semi - minor axes of @xmath22 32 and @xmath23 12 at pa@xmath24 .",
    "this ellipse is different from that in the @xmath15-band ( @xmath22 28 and @xmath23 12 at pa @xmath25 ) , but it is consistent with the ellipse in radio emission ( @xmath22 275 and @xmath23 125 at pa @xmath26 ; s99 ) .",
    "the s(1 ) emission appears to arise from a ring similar to the br@xmath1 emission .",
    "the @xmath15-band ellipticity may be different since emission in the @xmath15-band is dominated by rsgs , whereas br@xmath1 and radio continuum give the orientation of the younger starburst ring which can be affected by gas dynamics e.g. in a barred potential .",
    "we compared our br@xmath1 images and the radio images of s99 with after registering the br@xmath1 , radio and k@xmath15-band images using fig . 4 of s99 .",
    "there is a reasonable correlation between the br@xmath1 and the radio emission to the south and southwest of the nucleus ( to within 02 ) . elsewhere",
    "this correlation is worse , as the strongest br@xmath1 peaks do not have radio counterparts to within a distance of 1@xmath4 . in general",
    ", br@xmath1 correlates better with radio than with the nir continuum .",
    "morphological differences between the br@xmath1 , radio and nir continuum images are probably due to differences in the ages of the emitting regions , possibly indicating several star forming epochs . a similar anticorrelation between the",
    "radio and nir continua has also been detected in several other starburst systems , e.g. m82 ( golla , allen & kronberg 1996 ) and ngc  253 ( sams et al . 1994 ; ulvestad & antonucci 1997 ) .",
    "we detected 9 emission regions defined by the br@xmath1 above @xmath27 level .",
    "furthermore , the region n , located at the nucleus , has no br@xmath1 but strong s(1 ) emission .",
    "the photometric apertures used were selected to avoid overlap between neighboring regions , but to include as much of the br@xmath1 emission as possible ( regions 19 ) .",
    "the smallest distance between the nearest emission regions is 12 , which is larger than the resolution of the smoothed images ( 10 ) , and much larger than the seeing during the observations ( 06 ) .",
    "note that there is some overlap between region n and region 3 .",
    "the smallest regions consist of only a few pixels , but these regions have radio counterparts ( s99 ) and are therefore probably real . furthermore , as all the regions consist of more than one pixel in unsmoothed image , they are unlikely be affected by cosmic rays or other defects .",
    "most of the regions are also identifiable when br@xmath1 frames were reduced separately in two halves .",
    "the aperture diameters used , the values of the airy function , the observed and dereddened br@xmath1 and s(1 ) fluxes and the @xmath0 colors for the emission regions are given in table  [ tab:7771emi ] .    to interpret the star forming properties of ngc  7771 , we have used the evolutionary model of leitherer et al .",

    "the br@xmath1 ew was estimated by subtracting a smooth galaxy model from the @xmath15-band image and dividing the br@xmath1 fluxes with the fluxes in the subtracted @xmath15-band image .",

    "similar extinction values were also derived by davies , alonso - herrero & ward ( 1997 ) , who suggested an average @xmath52 = 2.3 for the central starbursting regions based on the balmer decrement .",
    "if the dust and the emitting gas are mixed we derive a@xmath5 = 4.0 .",
    "s99 derived much greater @xmath53 from the h@xmath14/h@xmath54 ratio , and they suggested an even greater extinction ( @xmath55 ) towards the ionized gas from the radio / h@xmath14 ratio .",
    "higher extinction ( a@xmath565 mag ) is also suggested by the ir / blue luminosity ratio .",
    "extinction probably varies significantly in the ring ( see figure [ fig:7771jh ] for variations in extinction towards the continuum sources ) , but due to the lack of a high resolution h@xmath14 image , we use the average extinction value a@xmath5 = 2.8 mag in what follows .    to provide a check for the extinction , we estimated the extinction towards the continuum sources in the ring from the observed @xmath0 colors compared to the average @xmath21@xmath20 color of unobscured spiral galaxies ( @xmath57@xmath21@xmath20@xmath58 = 0.75 , @xmath57@xmath20@xmath15@xmath58 = 0.22 ; glass & moorwood 1985 ) assuming that only extinction affects the colors .",
    "the observed @xmath21@xmath20 colors ( figure [ fig:7771col ] ) of the ring are redder than the areas inside or outside the ring . from the nir colors we derive a slightly smaller extinction ( a@xmath5 = 0.53.9 , average a@xmath5 = 2.2 ) than that measured from the recombination line ratios , indicating that rsgs responsible for the nir continuum emission are located outside the hii regions surrounding the ob stars .",
    "alternatively , this result may also be a selection effect : the most heavily reddened regions may not be detectable in our images , and thus we are biased towards the low - extinction regions . the southern half of the ring is redder than the northern half ( figure [ fig:7771jh ] ) , and therefore extinction is probably greater in the south , as was noted by davies et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the exact value of the extinction does not affect the ew of br@xmath1 ( ie .",
    "age ) if there is no differential extinction between br@xmath1 and continuum sources , but it does scale up or down the properties derived from the luminosity of br@xmath1 , including mass , sfr , n(h@xmath28 ) and sn rate .",
    "our method of analysis , however , depends on the details of the modeling .",
    "real physical starbursts have a finite duration , so the ages derived for isf are really lower limits , as the ew of br@xmath1 grows as a function of the burst duration for a given age . the observed co indices ( smith et al .",
    "1996 ; ridgway , wynn  williams & becklin 1994 ) together with the ew of br@xmath1 can constrain the duration of the burst ( puxley , doyon & ward 1997 ) .",
    "the exponential decaying time of the burst may have been 15 myr ( puxley et al .",
    "1997 , their fig .",

    "the mass of the excited h@xmath3 can be estimated by following the procedure of meaburn et al .",
    "the average surface brightness of s(1 ) in an 84 ( 2.4 kpc ) aperture is 6.4@xmath59 w @xmath49 sr@xmath10 and assuming t@xmath60 = 2000 k we derive 1740 m@xmath7 for the mass of the excited h@xmath3 . this value must be multiplied by @xmath111.1 for the fabry - perot calibration and by a small , unknown factor for the linewidth , which may be broader than the passband width of the fabry - perot ( @xmath11400 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "the resulting value @xmath111900 m@xmath7 may be compared with the seyfert galaxies ngc  3079 ( 800 m@xmath7 , meaburn et al .",

    "the ratio is slightly larger ( 1.302.10 ) , indicating perhaps a relatively larger contribution from shock excitation , possibly due to supernovae or stellar winds . alternatively , gas clouds may be denser , or the upper mass cut - off higher in these regions .",
    "this seems more plausible , because there is no evidence of lower sn rate in the south ( table 2 ; s99 ) .",
    "the only emission region outside the ring ( 4 ) has the lowest value of s(1)/br@xmath1 ( 0.61 ) .",
    "we have detected the nucleus in s(1 ) but not in br@xmath1 , which is also the case in seyfert galaxies ngc  1097 and ngc  6574 ( kotilainen",

    "l99 employs the newest geneva evolutionary tracks ( see e.g. charbonnel et al .",

    "a difference between the estimates derived from h@xmath14 and the radio continuum was also noticed by s99 , but since extinction is much higher in the optical wavelengths , they were able to explain the difference with @xmath71 .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that s99 have overestimated the fraction of thermal flux in the radio continuum .",
    "they suggest that more than 50% of the flux at 6 cm is thermal , at least in the circumnuclear region .",
    "this is a much larger fraction than what was found in the nuclear regions of normal galaxies ( between 3% and 20% ; turner & ho 1994 ) .",

    "<S> these data are used to investigate the morphology and extinction of the starburst ring and to study its star forming properties and history by comparing the observed quantities with an evolutionary population synthesis model .    </S>",
    "<S> the clumpy morphology of ngc  7771 varies strongly with wavelength , due to the combination of extinction ( for which we derive an average value of a@xmath5 = 2.8 ) , emission from hot dust and red supergiants , and several stellar generations in the ring . also , the ellipticity and the position angle of the ring depend on the wavelength </S>",
    "<S> .    the starburst ring in ngc  7771 exhibits small br@xmath1 equivalent widths . assuming a constant star formation model with m@xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> = 100 m@xmath7 results in very long lifetimes of the star forming regions ( up to 1 gyr ) , in disagreement with the clumpy near  infrared morphology and the observed radio spectral index of ngc  7771 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is only slightly remedied by assuming a reduced upper mass cutoff ( m@xmath6 = 30 m@xmath7 ) , resulting in ages between 8 and 180 myr . </S>",
    "<S> we prefer an instantaneous star formation model with m@xmath6 = 100 m@xmath7 which can explain the derived br@xmath1 equivalent widths if a single starburst occurred 67 myr ago . </S>",
    "<S> the main excitation mechanism of the molecular gas , based on the observed s(1)/br@xmath1 ratio , appears to be excitation by uv radiation from hot young stars . </S>",
    "<S> we derive m @xmath8 1900 m@xmath7 for the mass of the excited h@xmath3 . </S>"
