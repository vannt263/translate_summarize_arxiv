    "it has been shown that any multiqubit gate can be decomposed into two classes of elementary quantum gates , namely , universal two - qubit controlled phase gate and one - qubit unitary gate , which are the basic building blocks of a quantum computer .",
    "however , the procedure of decomposing multiqubit gates into the elementary gates usually becomes very complicated as the number of qubits increases when using the conventional gate decomposition method . to reduce the complexity of the physical realization of practical quantum computing and quantum information processing ,",
    "the direct implementation of multiqubit logic gates with multiple control qubits  @xcite or multiple target qubits  @xcite is thus very important .    in recent years",
    ", considerable theoretical effort has been devoted to a class of coupled cavity models , which typically describe a series of optical cavities , each containing one or more atoms , photons are permitted to hop between the cavities .",
    "the coupled cavity arrays are promise to overcome the problem of individual addressability and have several interesting potential applications , including quantum information processing and simulations of quantum strongly correlated many - body systems .",
    "theoretical studies on quantum quantum computing and quantum information processing have been put forwarded for the use of the atom - light interaction in coupled microcavity arrays  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for implementing a multiqubit phase gate with one control qubit and multiple target qubits with three - level atoms at distant nodes in coupled cavity arrays .",
    "this type of multiqubit controlled phase gate is essentially equivalent to @xmath0 two - qubit controlled phase gates , each having a shared control qubit ( qubit 1 ) but a different target qubit ( qubits @xmath1 ) . in the scheme , the selective off - resonant qubit - qubit coupling between the ground states of two atoms , induced by the external fields and the cavity modes , leads to an effective phase shift between the control qubit and any target qubit by choosing the parameters of the external fields appropriately .",
    "the scheme has the following merits : ( i ) it can be accomplished only in one step , which greatly simplifies the experimental realization and reduces the total gate time ; ( ii ) it does not require the individual addressing of the trapped atoms ; ( iii ) multiqubit gate operation among spatially separated quantum nodes is very meaningful for distributed quantum computing and quantum communication networks .",
    "moreover , it would be an important step toward efficiently constructing quantum circuits and quantum algorithms .",

    "@xcite , the coupling strength can be achieved as @xmath108 .",

    "in conclusion , we have proposed an efficient scheme to realize the selective coherent coupling between the control qubit and any target qubit in a 1d quantum network .",
    "we consider the scheme in a 1d coupled cavity system with three - level atoms at distant nodes trapped in separated cavities .",
    "it is unnecessary to utlize a single - photon source or inject a single - photon into an optical cavity . with a suitable choice of the system parameters ,",
    "a multiqubit phase gate with one control qubit and multiple target qubits can be directly achieved , which greatly simplifies the experimental realization and reduces the total gate time .",
    "furthermore , the interaction among the atoms we use to implement the multiqubit phase gate can also be realized in other systems with three - level configuration .",
