    "the study of low - lying magnetic excitations in quenched disordered systems presents a number of challenges . while the absence of translational invariance is a complicator arising in all aspects both of static and dynamic behavior of inhomogeneous magnets , investigation of spin waves",
    "is made even harder because , in many cases of interest , the exact ground state configuration is not known .",
    "one way around the latter obstacle has been to resort to simplified model systems for which the exact ground state is known , but which nevertheless still display non - trivial dynamical features .",
    "such features , it is expected , may shed light on the behavior of their experimentally - realized , rather more complex , counterparts .    here",
    "we deal with vector spin glasses , i. e. , heisenberg spins with competing ferro and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "it is known that the simplest realization of the edwards - anderson picture , where one has equal concentrations of positive and negative nearest - neighbor bonds of equal strength , leads ( in lattices of space dimensionality @xmath6 ) to frustration and , consequently , to a macroscopically degenerate ( classical ) ground state .",
    "the drawback just described does not arise in mattis spin - glasses , where the mattis transformation  @xcite `` gauges away '' disorder effects , as far as most static aspects are concerned .",
    "it is known that the mattis transformation does not remove the disorder effects in the dynamics of these so - called heisenberg - mattis spin glasses , which is non - trivial .",
    "indeed , investigations of spin - wave propagation in such systems  @xcite have unveiled many features which stand in stark contrast , e.g. , to the halperin - saslow ( hydrodynamic ) picture  @xcite of a linear dispersion relation for low - energy excitations .    here",
    ", we shall assume that the spin magnitude is @xmath7 , so that quantum fluctuations can be safely neglected  @xcite ( classical limit ) .",
    "an alternative to using the mattis picture can be pursued by studying usual spin glasses ( i.e. with random @xmath8 bonds ) in the high - field limit , as this additional feature stabilizes a ferromagnetic - like ground state while still incorporating quenched ( bond ) disorder  @xcite .",
    "however , results thus obtained differ rather drastically from those pertaining to the zero - field case .",
    "in fact , it has been found that , even in zero field and space dimensionality @xmath9 where frustration effects are absent , `` unmagnetized '' spin glasses ( i.e. in which the concentrations of ferro- ( @xmath10 ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath11 ) bonds are equal ) differ substantially from their `` magnetized '' ( @xmath12 ) counterparts  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the spectral and localization properties of heisenberg - mattis spin glasses .",
    "our emphasis is on unmagnetized systems in space dimensionalities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , at @xmath2 .",
    "we use numerical transfer - matrix methods to calculate lyapunov exponents  @xcite , and eigenvalue - counting theorems , coupled with gaussian elimination algorithms  @xcite , to evaluate densities of states .",
    "though early numerical studies  @xcite already highlighted a number of distinctive features exhibited by such systems , motivation for further research is to be found in recent theoretical insights  @xcite , especially in connection with the low - energy , long - wavelength regime .    in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we recall pertinent aspects of heisenberg - mattis spin glasses .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] reports on an extension , to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of the analytical scaling techniques introduced in ref .   for @xmath9 ; in section  [ sec:4 ] we report numerical calculations of lyapunov exponents and of densities of states , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , concluding remarks are made .",
    "we consider heisenberg spins on sites of a square , or simple - cubic , lattice , with nearest - neighbor couplings : @xmath13 the bonds are randomly taken from a quenched , binary probability distribution , @xmath14 so for @xmath15 one has the unmagnetized spin glass .",
    "the mattis model ascribes disorder to sites rather than bonds ( @xmath16 ) , so that the hamiltonian reads : @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) with probability @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this way , the overall energy is minimized by making @xmath20 , which constitutes a ( classical ) ground state of the hamiltonian eq .  ( [ eq:3 ] ) , to be referred to as @xmath21 .",
    "thus , disorder is effectively removed from static properties , but not from the dynamics , because of the handedness of heisenberg spin commutation relations . indeed , considering low - energy excitations , the equations of motion for the spins are , with @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 etc and @xmath25 are nearest neighbors of site @xmath26 .",
    "so , putting @xmath27 , one gets  @xcite , upon application of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) to @xmath21  : @xmath28 where the @xmath29 are mattis - transformed local ( on - site ) spin - wave amplitudes . for the eigenmodes with frequency @xmath30 ( in units of the exchange constant @xmath31 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) leads to @xmath32 goldstone modes are expected to occur , since disorder does not destroy the symmetry of the system in spin space  @xcite .",
    "the relationship of frequency to wave number , @xmath33 , at low energies is characterized by the dynamic exponent @xmath34 : @xmath35 in @xmath9 , where the scattering length coincides with the localization length  @xcite , the definition of @xmath33 is unique .",
    "indeed , numerical calculations  @xcite of the @xmath9 density of states and of the lyapunov exponent point to the same value @xmath36 , predicted analytically  @xcite . for @xmath6 this degeneracy",
    "is expected to be lifted .",
    "as we shall see below , different exponents come up , depending on whether localization or density - of - states properties are being considered .",
    "we briefly review the treatment of one - dimensional systems , given in ref .  .",
    "in this case , eq .  ( [ eq:6 ] ) becomes @xmath37 a transfer - matrix ( tm ) approach@xcite , can be formulated , giving  @xcite : @xmath38 the allowed frequencies for a chain with @xmath39 spins and periodic boundary conditions , @xmath40 , are determined by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 equivalently , the condition @xmath43 determines the eigenfrequencies . scaling the system by a linear dilation factor @xmath44 ,",
    "the dynamics is preserved if the frequencies are transformed ( @xmath45 ) , in such a way that @xmath46 using properties of the matrices @xmath47 , one finds  @xcite that the first - order term ( in @xmath30 ) of @xmath48 has a coefficient equal to @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , correspondence of the @xmath50 with an unbiased random - walk makes the determining variable @xmath51 , so that the ( length ) scaling of the frequencies is @xmath52 , and the low - energy dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) has an anomalous power ( dynamic exponent ) @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , careful consideration of higher - order terms  @xcite shows that the combination @xmath53 is present to all orders , thus scaling is expected to hold even away from the @xmath4 region ( though not the single power - law form , eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) ) .",
    "a suitable framework for extensions of this treatment to space dimensionalities @xmath54 is found in quasi one dimensional geometries , i.e. @xmath55 systems with @xmath56 . in",
    "what follows , we shall always make use of periodic boundary conditions across the @xmath57 transverse directions .    considering @xmath0 for simplicity , a tm can be set up on a strip of width @xmath58 sites , so an @xmath58- component vector @xmath59 corresponds to each column @xmath26 along the strip , with the recursion relation @xmath60 where @xmath61 @xmath62 being the @xmath63 identity matrix , while @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given by : @xmath66 hence , @xmath67 generalizations to higher @xmath68 are immediate , with the vector @xmath69 now having @xmath70 components , and the matrices @xmath62 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 being @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 matrix @xmath73 is symplectic , that is , its eigenvalues occur in pairs @xmath74 .",
    "note that matrix @xmath75 is symplectic as well .    for @xmath6 , a feature which does not occur in the one - dimensional case",
    "is that there are transverse momentum modes . returning to @xmath0 for illustration , these are indeed the eigenmodes of matrix @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2dtm3 ] ) , with corresponding energies @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "we briefly make contact with the analogous case of a homogeneous system of length @xmath39 , for which @xmath78 , @xmath79=0 $ ] , and the eigenstates of @xmath64 are also eigenstates of the full hamiltonian , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "this reminds us that , in @xmath6 , the energy of a mode is not related only to its longitudinal wavevector , as is the case in @xmath9 . upon introduction of randomness ,",
    "the commutation relation is destroyed ( contrary to the one - dimensional case where both @xmath64 and @xmath44 are numbers ) and , consequently , the interplay between frequency- and wavevector- aspects can only be measured via the accumulated statistics of many local realizations of disorder .",
    "therefore , in @xmath6 one may expect the picture of a single length controlling both ( spatial ) attenuation and ( time ) oscillation damping  @xcite , which holds for @xmath9 spin glasses , to be replaced by one where each of these properties is governed by a distinct quantity .",
    "we now return to spin glasses . from the eigenvectors of @xmath64 ,",
    "`` spinor '' generalizations can be built , which are eigenvectors of @xmath75 , with eigenvalues @xmath82 indexed by @xmath10 ; one can show that @xmath83 . while such spinors are obviously not eigenvectors of @xmath84 , the contribution given by each diagonal element of @xmath85 , corresponding to fixed @xmath10 , to the trace of @xmath86 , can be worked out to first order in @xmath30 .",
    "use is made of the fact that , analogously to the @xmath9 case  @xcite , @xmath87 the result is : @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the joint contribution of both eigenspinors of @xmath75 indexed by @xmath10 ( associated respectively to eigenvalues @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "the `` critical '' ( large scale ) behavior is associated with small @xmath10 , in which case @xmath92 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace ] ) turns into : @xmath93    one can readily see that , for generic @xmath6 , this translates into : @xmath94 in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowpd ] ) , one has a sum of @xmath95 binary random variables , so this is gaussian distributed with rms value : @xmath96 upon scaling of linear dimensions by a factor @xmath44 , under which frequency scales as @xmath97 , and requiring invariance of the term given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sqrt ] ) ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dtm3 ] ) ) , one gets : @xmath98 consideration of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowp ] ) of higher than first order in @xmath30 shows that , unlike the @xmath9 case , the trace of the full tm is not just a function of the variable given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sqrt ] ) , because complicated sums occur , involving both longitudinal and transverse wave vectors .",
    "this is in line with the reasoning presented above , to the effect that the simultaneous presence of both longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom invalidates the single - length picture , predicted analytically  @xcite and numerically confirmed  @xcite for @xmath9 .    while it is plausible to expect that , for some low - energy regime in @xmath6 the scaling result , eq .  ( [ eq : zlowp ] )",
    "might hold true , direct verification is called for .",
    "the procedure for calculating lyapunov exponents on strips or bars is the same as that used for anderson localization problems  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in both cases the tm is symplectic , and one can use oseledec s theorem and dynamic filtration to extract the smallest lyapunov exponent , whose inverse is the largest localization length . for heisenberg spin - glass chains , this has been done  @xcite , numerically confirming the result @xmath36 obtained analytically in ref .  .",
    "we have investigated strips of widths @xmath99 in @xmath0 , in which for each energy @xmath30 we took @xmath100 iterations of the tm , and bars with @xmath63 cross - section , @xmath101 in @xmath5 .",
    "in @xmath5 we used @xmath100 for @xmath102 , @xmath103 for @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "in contrast with @xmath9 , here one must take into account finite - size effects , introduced via the transverse dimension @xmath58 , thus calculated localization lengths are denoted by @xmath107 . using standard finite - size scaling theory  @xcite",
    ", it is expected that the behavior of scaled localization lengths @xmath108 , when plotted against @xmath109 , will allow one to infer the bulk ( @xmath110 ) properties of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lce2d ] we see that in @xmath0 good data collapse , extending as far as @xmath111 , is achieved when @xmath112 , as predicted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zlowp ] ) . at the low - energy end , @xmath113 ,",
    "the quasi - one dimensional character of the strips begins to dominate , and the scaling curve crosses over to the effective @xmath9 regime characterized by @xmath114 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lce3d ] the scaling plot for @xmath5 , with @xmath115 as predicted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zlowp ] ) , is exhibited .",
    "the quality of data collapse is remarkably inferior to that of @xmath0 data .",
    "an examination of the behavior of @xmath108 against @xmath30 shows that curves corresponding to pairs @xmath116 have well - defined crossings at low energies @xmath117 .",
    "the usual interpretation of these , in the finite - size scaling context , would point to a localization - delocalization transition  @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that the locations of crossings appear to approach @xmath118 with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "this would be consistent with the idea that all magnons are delocalized in @xmath5 , which is supported , e.g. , by the field - theoretical results of ref .  .",
    "we postpone a discussion of this point ( and similar ones associated to the behavior found above for @xmath0 ) , to section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the calculation of densities of states per unit energy interval ( dos ) , @xmath119 , and their integrated counterparts ( idos ) , @xmath120 , makes use of eigenvalue - counting theorems  @xcite .",
    "our implementation resorts to gaussian elimination algorithms on quasi one - dimensional geometries ( @xmath55 , with @xmath121 ) , and closely follows the steps described in refs .   where the systems under investigation were , respectively , phonons in disordered solids , and tight - binding electrons ( anderson localization ) .",
    "the key feature shared between these problems and the one studied here is the fact that , for an @xmath122 system with periodic boundary conditions across , the hamiltonian has a @xmath123- diagonal form , i.e. , it can only have non - zero elements in the @xmath70 lines above , and @xmath70 lines below , the diagonal .",

    "evaluation of its diagonal elements via gaussian elimination enables one to obtain the idos for any energy  @xcite , thus the dos may be calculated by numerical differentiation .",
    "for @xmath9 the eigenvalue counting ( used . , e.g. , in ref .",
    ") , may , alternatively , proceed via enumeration of nodes of the amplitude ratios which enter the evaluation of the ( single ) lyapunov exponent  @xcite . in order to test our recursion and elimination algorithms ,",
    "we applied them to this case and compared the outcome with that from node - enumeration .",
    "results are identical to within numerical accuracy , and the set produced by gaussian elimination is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos1d ] .    by sampling energies separated by logarithmically uniform intervals , we achieved a detailed view of the @xmath4 region , which is difficult to isolate in the corresponding dos results of refs .",
    "( where linear binning was used ) .",
    "one sees that the relationship @xmath128 is valid for more than two orders of magnitude in energy , up to @xmath129 . for guidance",
    ", we have also included the exact derrida - gardner result  @xcite .",
    "since we have considered only positive energy states in our calculation , the appropriate proportionality coefficient is twice that given in ref .  .",
    "for higher - dimensional cases , is is worth mentioning that the algorithms used here are much less computationally intensive than their lyapunov - exponent counterparts . for an @xmath130 system , the computational time rises as @xmath131 for the former  @xcite , and approximately as @xmath132 for the latter .",
    "this is mainly because of the frequent mutual orthogonalization of @xmath133 iterated vectors , which is necessary in order to avoid cross - contamination between eigenvectors associated to different lyapunov exponents .",
    "therefore , for dos and idos it is usually possible ( except for very low energies in @xmath5 , see below ) to work with systems whose transverse dimensions @xmath58 are large enough that finite - size effects are of little import .",
    "it remains only to make sure that the sample length @xmath39 is long enough , in order to achieve adequate sampling of quenched disorder configurations .",
    "we examined the effect of finite transverse dimensions , by evaluating pure - system quantities and comparing our results to the exact ones .",
    "though , having zero net magnetization , the spin glasses studied here are closer to antiferromagnets ( af ) than to homogeneous ferromagnets ( fm ) , the dos and idos of magnons in the latter exhibit some distinctive features , whose numerical reproduction is a non - trivial test of the adequacy and accuracy of our methods . for fm in @xmath0 , already with @xmath134 , @xmath135 the idos is at most @xmath136 off the exact value .",
    "this largest discrepancy happens close to @xmath137 where the analytical idos exhibits an inflection point , on account of the dos s logarithmic van hove singularity at the band center .",
    "increasing @xmath58 or @xmath39 does not significantly reduce the deviation close to @xmath137 ; however , it does improve agreement elsewhere on the energy axis .",
    "the calculated dos is rather sensitive to discrete - lattice effects ; nevertheless , the consequent oscillations are again much diminished by increasing @xmath58 , @xmath39 . for @xmath5 fm ,",
    "the relatively featureless idos is easier to reproduce . with @xmath138 , @xmath139 , deviations are down to , at most , @xmath140 ( though the dos still displays somewhat large oscillations , especially around the `` knees '' at @xmath137 and @xmath141 ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : idosp ] shows representative results , which are useful as guidelines for the investigation of disordered systems in @xmath0 and @xmath1 via gaussian elimination .    turning to pure af systems , for which the respective bandwidths are @xmath142 @xmath143 , and @xmath144 @xmath145 , again relatively small transverse dimensions @xmath58 provide results which closely follow the analytic values , except at very low @xmath30 . in this limit",
    ", the fact that the finite @xmath58 quantizes the transverse momentum leads to effective one - dimensional behavior ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) for @xmath30 less than a crossover frequency @xmath148 , @xmath112 . with the units used in this work",
    ", we found @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",

    "the main distinctions of the idos from its pure - system ( fm and af ) counterparts are : ( i ) close to @xmath154 , the upper limit of the af band , the fm idos s inflection point is replaced by a seeming `` knee '' , with a short flat section ; and ( ii ) saturation is reached below the fm band edge @xmath155 , but above the af edge @xmath156 ; by @xmath157 the idos is already within less than @xmath158 of unity .",
    "similar effects can be seen in early numerical work  @xcite , though in that reference saturation appears to be reached only above the fm band edge , at @xmath159 .",

    "( [ eq : disprel ] ) , taking into account the specific dependencies of @xmath222 and @xmath223 on @xmath33 , and force @xmath30 to be real in the latter .    for @xmath5 ,",
    "one expects  @xcite @xmath224 , @xmath225 , consistent with small line broadening at low @xmath33 ( i.e. propagating modes ) . from this , one then gets : @xmath226 so that the scaling variable is indeed @xmath227 .    for @xmath0 ,",
    "a similar argument can be made ( now on somewhat flimsier grounds , because all modes are expected to be localized , so the real and imaginary parts of the dispersion relation may be of the same order of magnitude ) . ignoring logarithmic corrections , the results of refs .",
    "are : @xmath224 , @xmath228 , from which we get : @xmath229 again consistent with the @xmath0 scaling variable being @xmath230",
    ".    the outcome of our density - of - states calculations for @xmath0 can be very closely fitted , for low energies @xmath170 , to the logarithmically - corrected form predicted in ref .",

    "furthermore , one gets @xmath231 plus enhancing logarithmic corrections ( recall the effective exponent @xmath232 from fig .",
    "[ fig : dos2dle ] ) , which is in line with the vanishing of group velocity ( mode softening )  @xcite as @xmath4 .    finally , our @xmath5 density - of - states results are again consistent with the pure af behavior predicted  @xcite to hold above @xmath233 .",
