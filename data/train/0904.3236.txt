    "when the wave function is forced to evolve continuously between two competing ground states , a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) takes place between these two states at the transition , the length scale of quantum fluctuations becomes infinite , and exotic states of condensed matter are expected @xcite .",
    "recently , several remarkable features of a ( qpt ) have been observed in c@xmath0 quantum dots ( qd s ) with even occupancy inserted in a nanoscale constriction @xcite . in the last years",
    "there has been a great interest in systems of quantum dots ( qd s ) because of the possible technological applications , and also because they constitute ideal systems with a single magnetic impurity in which several parameters can be tuned .",
    "when the qd has an odd number of electrons and the coulomb repulsion @xmath1 is large enough , the conductance at zero bias is increased below a characteristic kondo temperature @xmath2 as a consequence of the kondo effect .",
    "this is a usual feature of single - electron transistors built with semiconductor qd s or single molecules @xcite and is well understood in terms of the simplest ordinary anderson model ( oam ) in which a configuration with a doublet is hybridized with a singlet . in a dot with an even number of electrons , there are two competing states for the ground state configuration : a singlet in which two particles occupy the lowest level ( say @xmath3 ) and a triplet in which one electron is promoted to the next level and coupled ferromagnetically ( @xmath4 and its su(2 ) partners ) due to the strong hund coupling @xcite . the simplest anderson model which describes the system mixes these four states with a doublet ( @xmath5 ) by promoting a particle ( electron or hole ) to one of the leads @xcite .",
    "this is the singlet - triplet anderson model ( stam ) which had been used to describe valence fluctuating tm impurities in a cubic environment @xcite .",
    "this model has a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from a singlet to a doublet ground state as the energy of the triplet is decreased @xcite .",
    "when the triplet is well below the other states , there is a partial screening of the spin 1 that explains the zero bias kondo peak observed experimentally in this situation @xcite . on the other ( singlet ) side of the transition",
    "there is a dip in the conductance @xcite that has also been observed experimentally @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the experimental observations in c@xmath0 qd s can be understood in terms of this model and its qpt .",
    "the differential conductance @xmath6 as a function of temperature @xmath7 and bias voltage @xmath8 has been measured at both sides of the transition @xcite . on the singlet side of the transition , a dip in the conductance at @xmath9",
    "is observed in agreement with theoretical expectations @xcite as well as non - equilibrium measurements performed in carbon nanotubes @xcite . on the other side of the transition , @xmath6 as a function of @xmath8 shows a structure with three peaks that has not been quantitatively explained yet . as the temperature @xmath7 is decreased , the zero bias conductance @xmath10 first increases , then shows a shoulder or a plateau and then increases again . as stressed by the authors ,",
    "this behavior is still not understood @xcite .",
    "the last two figures of our paper are the theoretical counterpart of these experimental results .",
    "the main qualitatively features are reproduced .",
    "a more quantitative agreement would require a fine tuning of the parameters which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we provide an interpretation for the observed behavior .",
    "the stam assumes infinite @xmath1 and contains two neighboring charge configurations in the qd : @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 particles . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume @xmath13 to be even , performing an electron - hole transformation if necessary .",
    "then , the @xmath11 configuration contains a singlet @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the spin and @xmath17 its projection , and a triplet @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 , 0 or 1 ) , while the @xmath12 configuration consists of a doublet denoted by its spin 1/2 projection @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce the following creation operators for a particle in the dot @xcite    @xmath21    the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 hybridize via matrix elements @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the conduction states @xmath26 of two conducting leads @xmath27 ( left ) or @xmath28 ( right ) that transport the current through the qd , leading to the hamiltonian    @xmath29    \\notag \\\\ & & + \\sum_{\\nu k\\sigma } \\epsilon _ { \\nu k}c_{\\nu k\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } c_{\\nu k\\sigma } .",

    "@xmath34 plays a role and `` screens '' the remaining doublet ground state when the localized triplet is well below the singlet , leading to a singlet ground state @xcite .",
    "however , the energy scale involved in this second screening @xmath35 ( which depends exponentially on a small coupling constant @xcite ) might be very small . as discussed in ref .",
    ", this is likely the case of previous experiments @xcite , as well as those in c@xmath0 qd s @xcite : the theory in the general case @xcite predicts that the zero - bias conductance @xmath10 should decrease at very low temperatures and @xmath6 should also decrease for the smallest applied bias voltages @xmath8 in contrast to the observations .",
    "this indicates that @xmath35 is smaller than the smallest temperature in the experiments .",
    "the stam with only one conduction channel , also describes the mixing between the low lying states of the 4f@xmath36 and 4f@xmath37 configurations in a cubic crystal field @xcite . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the model reduces to the oam . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the model describes valence fluctuations between two magnetic configurations @xcite . in both limits , for constant density of conduction states and hybridizations , the model is exactly solvable ( by the bethe ansatz ) and the ground state is a singlet ( doublet ) in the first ( second ) case @xcite .",
    "thus , the model has a qpt as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "the position of the transition depends on the other parameters of the model , leading to a quantum critical surface that can be determined calculating the magnetic susceptibility at @xmath41 using numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath42 , the transition takes place exactly at @xmath43 , independently of the value of @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , along this line , the model can be mapped into an oam plus a free spin 1/2 @xcite .",
    "we will use these results to control the distance to the qcp .",
    "as discussed for example in ref . , the calculation of non - equilibrium properties of a strongly correlated system is a particular challenge for theory . a recent extension of the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) for the non - equilibrium case seems promising , but is not fully developed yet @xcite . for the oam , the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite and renormalized",
    "perturbation theory in @xmath1 @xcite have been useful .",
    "however , the latter is very difficult to extend to the stam .",
    "the so called poor man s scaling works well when either @xmath45 or the magnetic field energy is larger than @xmath46 @xcite and has been successfully extended for a model similar to the stam on the singlet side of the qpt @xcite .",
    "however , this method ceases to be valid near the quantum critical surface for small @xmath8 . instead",
    ", the nca can be extended to more general anderson models , like tose appropriate for ce compounds @xcite , co impurities on ag and cu @xcite or systems of two quantum dots out of equilibrium @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the nca to the stam out of equilibrium .",
    "we introduce auxiliary bosons , one for the singlet state and three for the triplets , and auxiliary fermions for the doublet , in analogy to the su(n)@xmath47su(m ) generalization of the anderson model @xcite .",
    "the spectral densities of the operators @xmath48 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ ope ] ) for given spin , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , are determined by convolutions from those of the auxiliary particles .",
    "the current is given by @xcite",

    "for the numerical evaluations , we consider the case in which the ground state configuration has an even number of particles ( @xmath59 ) . we choose @xmath60 ( without loss of generality ) and take a band width @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 will be our unit of energy .",
    "the choice @xmath65 allows us to have an accurate control of the distance to the qpt , while the main features of the results depend on this distance and not on the specific choice of parameters . for @xmath65 , if in addition @xmath66 , the stam can be mapped into an oam plus a free spin 1/2 ( ref .",
    "the oam has total coupling @xmath67 and inverted charge transfer energy and chemical potentials : @xmath68 , @xmath69 . using this mapping",
    "it can be shown that the densities of both models are related by @xmath70 and the absolute value of the current is the same . from the structure of the corresponding nca equations for both models ,",
    "we realize that the nca satisfies these equalities .",
    "this has also been verified numerically .",
    "furthermore , for any @xmath44 the qpt takes place at @xmath66 when @xmath65 @xcite .",

    "the flatter curve corresponds to the highest temperature .",

    "@xcite for @xmath75 ) and exhibit the usual kondo resonance at the fermi level .",
    "the half width of this peak allows to define a kondo temperature @xmath2 .",
    "how do the spectral densities evolve as one moves away from the quantum critical surface ?",
    "decreasing @xmath76 ( on the singlet side of the qpt ) @xmath49 displaces to positive frequencies , while @xmath50 decreases and displaces its weight to negative frequencies . as a consequence ,",
    "a gap opens in the sum @xmath77 entering eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) at low temperatures .",
    "this situation has already been studied previously and interpreted as the low temperature part of a two - stage kondo effect @xcite .    the spectral densities for @xmath78 are shown in fig .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , @xmath50 remains peaked at the fermi energy at low temperatures .",
    "this is a consequence of the partial kondo effect , by which the spin 1 at the dot forms a ground state doublet with the conduction electrons of both leads @xcite .",
    "the singlet part of the density @xmath79 displaces to negative frequencies in this case . therefore a pseudogap appears in the sum @xmath77 , but at finite frequencies , in contrast to the gap at the fermi level that develops at the singlet side of the qpt .",
    "note that at high temperatures both densities are quite similar and the differentiation between @xmath79 and @xmath80 develops at a characteristic temperature of the order of a fraction of @xmath40 .",
    "the equilibrium ( @xmath9 ) conductance as a function of temperature @xmath10 on the singlet side of the qpt , near the quantum critical line ( not shown ) shows a maximum at a finite temperature and agrees with previous results using nrg @xcite and with experiment @xcite . in particular , the increase and decrease of @xmath10 from its maximum value are logarithmic to a good degree of accuracy .    , ( b ) @xmath81.,width=226 ]    the differential conductance @xmath6 as a function of bias voltage on the singlet side of the transition is displayed in fig .",
    "[ didvs ] ( a ) .",
    "we have applied the voltage symmetrically ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , a dip develops at small voltages .",
    "the half width of the dip is of the order of @xmath83 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the experimental ones ( fig .",
    "4 c of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for other parameters , in particular larger values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( less valence fluctuations )",
    "we obtain curves that look similar to those reported in carbon nanotubes , with a flat bottom at low temperatures , explained using poor man s scaling @xcite .",
    "an example is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ didvs ] ( b )     as a function of temperature ( full line ) and contributions from the singlet ( dashed dot dot line ) and triplet ( dashed line ) for @xmath85 .",

    "the circles correspond to eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) .",
    "@xmath88.,width=264 ]    the most novel experimental results are those on the  triplet side \" of the transition ( @xmath78 ) . as the temperature",
    "is decreased , @xmath10 increases until it reaches a plateau at the characteristic energy @xmath40 and then it continues to increase @xcite .",
    "this is in general , the behavior that we obtain , as displayed in fig .",
    "as the partial contribution to the conductance for each density reveals , the plateau is due to the contribution of the singlet part of the dot spectral density , namely @xmath49 which is peaked at @xmath89 ( see fig . [ dens ] ) .",
    "this plateau has not been observed in previous calculations using nrg @xcite .",
    "we believe that the reason for this is the lack of resolution of nrg to describe peaks in the spectral density out of the fermi energy , like that of @xmath49 .",
    "a clear manifestation of this is a system in which the kondo peak is split in two out of the fermi level @xcite .",
    "in fact , while nrg uses a logarithmic frequency mesh centered at the fermi energy , we find that in order to obtain enough accuracy in the convolutions that define @xmath79 and @xmath50 , it is necessary to use two different dense logarithmic meshes , centered at the corresponding peaks .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ gt ] shows the evolution of the equilibrium conductance as the system is displaced from the quantum critical line to the triplet region . at this line ,",
    "@xmath10 is the same as the corresponding result for the oam obtained using the mapping mentioned above . in this case , a fit of @xmath10 using the empirical curve derived by fitting results of the nrg for a spin 1/2    @xmath90 ^{s } } , \\label{ge}\\ ] ]    with @xmath91 works very well .",
    "we could not find other regions in which similar empirical curves would fit well a large portion of the curve .",
    "when @xmath76 increases , the degeneracy in the ground state is reduced and @xmath10 decreases in the whole range of temperatures . however , in contrast to the case @xmath92 , the conductance at zero temperature retains values near to the ideal one @xmath88 due to the partial kondo effect .    in fig .",
    "[ didvt ] we show the non - equilibrium differential conductance @xmath6 on the triplet side at several temperatures . at low temperatures , there is one peak centered at @xmath9 and other two centered at @xmath93 .",
    "this three - peak structure also agrees qualitatively well with experiment @xcite .",
    "actually in the later , the peak at @xmath94 is higher than that at @xmath95 , while our results are even in @xmath8 due to our assumption of a symmetric voltage drop . changing this",
    "we can easily control the relative height of both peaks . in any case ,",
    "the main point is the existence of these three peaks , which is also a consequence of the particular structure of the spectral densities @xmath79 and @xmath50 at equilibrium and low temperatures ( see fig . [ dens ] ) .",
    "the peak at @xmath9 is due to the @xmath50 which is peaked at the fermi energy .",
    "when @xmath96 reaches energies at which @xmath79 is peaked , this density starts to contribute significantly to the current @xmath97 [ see eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) ] and @xmath6 increases .",
    "finally , for large @xmath96 , @xmath97 tends to saturate and @xmath6 decreases again .",
    "the effect of temperature is to broaden the peaks and at high enough temperatures only one broad peak in @xmath6 is present , in agreement with experiment . for different parameters as those of fig .",
    "1 , this broadening of the spectral densities is already important at @xmath98 and increases with @xmath99 in such a way that even at @xmath100 only one peak in @xmath6 is present .",
    "this happens for example at @xmath75 , @xmath101 , for which @xmath6 ( not shown ) has a monotonic behavior for positive @xmath8 , displaying only a shoulder for @xmath102 .",
    "and several temperatures.,width=264 ]    in summary , the transport properties recently observed near the singlet - triplet quantum phase transition in quantum dots can be explained in the framework of the singlet - triplet anderson model with one channel per conduction lead , out of equilibrium , using the non - crossing approximation .",
    "we made use of exact results to control the distance to the quantum critical point .",
    "the differential conductance @xmath6 as a function of bias voltage is markedly different at both sides of the transition showing a dip ( peak ) at small voltages on the singlet ( triplet ) side and often a three - peak structure on the triplet side .",
    "the zero bias conductance @xmath10 as a function of temperature displays a plateau due to the contribution of the excitations from the localized singlet to the doublet .",
