    ", the phase estimation algorithm extracts the phase of an evolving quantum system continuously without the collapse of a quantum state .",
    "so the ground energy of an interacting system is obtained as a function of coupling strength . with the help of the hellmann - feynman theorem  @xcite , the expectation value of an observable for the ground state of an interacting system is obtained . as a test of our method , we simulate on classical computers three quantum systems : a displaced harmonic oscillator , a quartic anharmonic oscillator  @xcite , and a potential scattering model  @xcite .",

    "the measurement of the index qubits gives us a good approximation to @xmath1 with probability @xmath6 , and makes @xmath7 collapse to @xmath2 .",
    "it is instructive to compare ( [ time - evolution ] ) with the quantum monte carlo method which uses the imaginary time @xmath8 to project the input state onto the ground state  @xcite @xmath9 first , in order to find the ground state energy , both ( [ time - evolution ] ) and ( [ qmc ] ) require a good input state close to @xmath10 .",

    "second , for each run , while ( [ time - evolution ] ) outputs @xmath1 randomly , ( [ qmc ] ) produces @xmath11 always . finally , ( [ time - evolution ] ) is a real time evolution , however , ( [ qmc ] ) is the imaginary time evolution , i.e. , a diffusion process , which is implemented by classical random walks .",
