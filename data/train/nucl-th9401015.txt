    "the aim of the present investigation is to find a phenomenological macroscopic formula for the nuclear radius .",
    "a charge distribution inside a nucleus depends not only on it s mass number @xmath0 and the ground state deformation caused by shell effects , but also on the neutron excess @xmath2 .",
    "the equilibrium deformation of a nucleus can be established by the minimalization of the potential energy obtained by one of the microscopic methods . but to know the range ( @xmath3 ) of nuclear charge in any ( @xmath4 ) direction , it is necessary to describe properly the radius ( @xmath5 ) of the corresponding spherical nucleus which has been deformed keeping its volume constant .    the simplest known liquid drop formula for the nuclear radius @xmath6 with @xmath7 does nt lead to the experimentally known mean square radii @xmath8 ( msr ) [ 1 ] or their isotopic shifts [ 2 ] .",
    "a popular liquid droplet model [ 3 ] gives also rather unsatisfactory results for msr .",
    "we are going to find the best dependence of @xmath5 on mass number ( @xmath0 ) and neutron excess ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a corresponding formula which reproduces the experimentally measured isotopic shifts of mrs was already proposed in refs .",
    "[ 4 , 5 ] .",
    "that formula was obtained without the fit to the absolute values of the model independent of msr data [ 1 ] .",
    "now we would like to propose a new simple expression for the proton radius ( @xmath5 ) which reproduces not only the isotopic shifts but also the magnitude of msr for all even  even nuclei with proton numbers @xmath9 .",
    "the msr values of even  even nuclei are calculated macroscopically with a uniform charge distribution @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the volume of a nucleus conserved during deformation @xmath12 @xmath3 is the radius dependent on deformation , calculated with the equilibrium shapes @xmath13 taken from ref . [ 6 ] .",
    "the msr values are given by the integral @xmath14 and they are evaluated for axially symmetric nuclei with the radius @xmath15    \\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 are the legender polynomials and @xmath17   d\\cos\\vartheta\\right\\}^{-1/3 }   \\,\\,\\ ,   .\\ ] ] the last relation originates from the volume conservation condition when a nucleus deforms and @xmath5 is the radius of the corresponding spherical nucleus . for practical use the formula ( 4 ) for small quadrupole deformations",
    "could be estimated approximatly by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the electric monopole moment of the spherical nucleus and @xmath20 is the electric quadrupole moment of the deformed nucleus .",
    "the charge radius @xmath5 in formula ( 6 ) is chosen in the following form ( see also [ 4 - 5 ] ) @xmath21 the set of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters are obtained by the fit of @xmath25 [ 1 ] and its isotopic shifts @xmath26 [ 2 ] for even  even nuclei with the proton numbers @xmath9 .",
    "we have assumed that the sum of the mean square errors : @xmath27    \\scriptstyle z \\geq z_{min }    \\end{array}}\\kern-5 mm    \\left(\\langle r^{2}\\rangle_{i } - \\langle r^{2}\\rangle^{exp}_{i}\\right)\\ ] ] should be minimal .",
    "simultaneously we have kept the minimal sum of square errors of msr isotopic shifts for all experimentally measured sets of even  even isotopes @xmath28 i.e. @xmath29    \\scriptstyle z \\geq z_{min }    \\end{array}}\\kern-5 mm    \\left(\\delta\\langle r^{2}\\rangle^{a , a'}_{i } - \\delta\\langle r^{2 }    \\rangle^{a , a'}_{i , exp}\\right ) \\,\\,\\ ,   .\\ ] ] the results obtained with our simple formula for the charge radius ( 8) will be compared in the next section with the liquid droplet estimates of msr [ 3 ] .",
    "after an analysis of 22 isotopic shifts of msr for even  even nuclei we have proposed in ref . [ 5 ] a formula for @xmath5 containing the isotopic term , @xmath30 with the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but without the @xmath33 term , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "this formula was good enough to reproduce all the msr isotopic shifts of even  even elements above @xmath35 and the average magnitude of msr for the gold isotopes .",
    "unfortunately it was rather impossible to get a reasonable agreement of msr values of lighter elements @xmath36 without introducing an additional @xmath37 term .",
    "fitting @xmath5 described by formula ( 6 ) to the msr [ 1 ] and @xmath38 [ 2 ] data for all the @xmath9 elements we have recorded the following set of parameters : @xmath39 . in every case",
    "the sum of square errors of msr is more than six times lower than in the liquid droplet model [ 3 ] .",
    "it is interesting , that the @xmath24 parameter is almost stable around @xmath40 , independently on the number of fitted data and inclusion of the @xmath33 term .",
    "the values @xmath22 and @xmath24 are almost the same for the case of @xmath41 elements without the @xmath37 in @xmath5 .",
    "we have also tested the different powers of @xmath0 in the new term @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we have achives the best agreement for @xmath44 , but for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the quality of the fitment was comparable with that for @xmath47 .",
    "the results of our investigation are illustrated in the figures 1 - 5 . in the figs . 1 - 3 the results of the msr values obtained in the three cases of @xmath5 are illustrated .    in fig .",
    "1 the msr values obtained with the traditional liquid drop formula ( 1 ) are plotted .",
    "they are obviously to small even for the spherical case ( dashed line ) in comparison with the experimental data [ 1 ] marked by stars .",
    "the difference between the macroscopic results including the effect of the deformations of nuclei taken from ref .",
    "[ 6 ] and the experimental data @xmath48 are represented by the length of vertical lines shown under each experimentally known element (  bars  ) .",
    "the differences are rather large , especially for the light elements .    in fig .",
    "2 the msr results were obtained using our previous formula [ 5 ] , but with the better set of parameters ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , fitting , both @xmath51 and @xmath38 values .",
    "the fitment is much better than that in fig .",
    "1 , both for heavier and lighter elements , even in the spherical case . when including deformation , the differences ( bars on the figure ) between macroscopic and experimental value @xmath52 almost disappear , but the lighter elements are still not well reproduced .",
    "it was necessary to introduce an additional term in the formula for the charge radius in order to increase the model estimates of msr for the lightest nuclei .    in fig .",
    "3 the msr results for the formula ( 8) with the best set of parameters fitted to the @xmath48 and @xmath53 data are shown .",
    "the agreement is good . in spite of a few cases",
    "the differences between the macroscopic and experimental msr values have almost disappeared when the deformations of the nuclides were taken into account [ 6 ] .",
    "one can compare these results with the liquid droplet calculation according to ref .",
    "[ 3 ] illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , where the theoretical results are much smaller than the experimental data . also",
    "the results for msr obtained with the newest version of the droplet model [ 6 ] are only a little better than those of [ 3 ] in fig .",
    "it is obvious that a new analysis of liquid droplet parameters in order to reproduce msr values is needed .",
    "we hope that our investigation will be helpful .",
    "the importance of introducing ( @xmath2 ) dependence in @xmath5 is illustrated in figs .",
    "5 - 6 , where the msr isotopic shifts @xmath54 of all the experimentally known even  even isotopes [ 2 ] are compared with our estimates .    in fig .",
    "5 the differences between the macroscopic results calculated with equilibrium deformations of [ 7 ] and experimental data [ 1 ] @xmath55 are plotted in the case of the traditional liquid drop formula ( 1 ) . the differences are large .",
    "they reach even @xmath56 for some nuclei . when including the @xmath5 depending on isospin @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , these differences decrease significantly .",
    "one has to add that the same quality of the fit of @xmath38 as with formula ( 8) was already achieved for the two parametric formula ( 12 ) , but the magnitude of msr values for light nuclei are not well reproduced .",
    "we can draw the following conclusions from our investigations :    * the traditional liquid drop formula , depending on mass number @xmath0 only , is not able to give a good mean square nuclear charge radius @xmath8 or its isotopic shifts . * in order to reproduce the data of @xmath8 and @xmath58 of the even  even nuclei one should use the three parametric formulas for the spherical nuclear charge radius @xmath59 * for the nuclei with @xmath35 one can omit the @xmath33 term and use the formula @xmath60 * the liquid droplet model gives systematically larger msr estimates of the nuclear charge .",
