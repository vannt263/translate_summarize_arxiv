    "control of x - ray processes using intense optical lasers represents an emerging scientific frontier  one which combines x - ray physics with strong - field laser control  @xcite .",
    "while the past decade has produced many examples where intense lasers at optical wavelengths are used to control molecular motions  @xcite , extension to the control of intraatomic inner - shell processes is quite new  @xcite . at first glance , it is an unusual concept to control x - ray processes using an optical or infrared radiation field since x - rays interact predominantly with inner - shell electrons , whereas longer wavelength radiation interacts with outer shell electrons .",
    "however , the inner and outer shells of atoms are coupled through resonant x - ray absorption , e.g. , promotion of a @xmath0-shell electron to an empty outer shell orbital , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . because outer shell electronic structure can be perturbed ( dressed ) by an optical radiation field",
    ", one can exert control over resonant x - ray absorption using optical lasers .",
    "reversible control is possible when the applied dressing field is gentle enough to significantly perturb outer - shell electronic structure , but is not intense enough to destroy ( ionize ) the atom .",
    "let us consider the optical field amplitude necessary to achieve this control , i.e. , to induce outer - shell transitions at a rate comparable to inner - shell processes . if we take the simplest case , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where absorption of an x - ray photon leads to the ejection of a @xmath0-shell electron , a @xmath1 hole is created .",
    "the resulting atom , containing a @xmath1  hole , is unstable and decays via both radiative and non - radiative ( auger ) channels  @xcite .",
    "these inner - shell decay rates increase with atomic number ; at @xmath2 the lifetime of the @xmath1 hole state is @xmath3 ( corresponding to a @xmath4 level width via the uncertainty principle ) . in order to compete with the rapid inner - shell decay , electromagnetic transitions in the outer shell must be induced at a comparable rate .",
    "the transition rate in a driven two - level system is given by the rabi flopping frequency , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the transition dipole matrix element between levels  1 and 2 , @xmath7 is the electric field amplitude . in practical units ,",

    "the laser - induced rate is @xmath22 that of the decay rate of the @xmath23  hole state in neon !",
    "( @xmath24 are given in angular frequency units ) therefore , if the electric field amplitude of the optical laser can be 1  atomic unit , or equivalently a laser intensity of @xmath25 , outer - shell transition rates can exceed inner - shell decay rates .",
    "this intensity can now be achieved with routinely available modern lasers  @xcite .",

    "inner and outer shells are coupled through resonant x - ray absorption . ]    after the strong optical laser field , the next ingredient needed to study control of ultrafast inner - shell processes is a tunable x - ray source .",
    "synchrotrons provide a convenient source of pulsed , tunable , polarized radiation from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "this range covers inner shell edges of all elements . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the three dominant photoprocesses , photoabsorption , elastic ( rayleigh ) scattering and inelastic ( compton ) scattering are shown for the bromine atom .",
    "photoabsorption cross sections greatly exceed scattering cross sections over energy ranges from below to far above the respective @xmath0  edges of each atom . in order to probe atoms and molecules subjected to strong pulsed optical fields ,",
    "a short x - ray pulse is helpful .",
    "a typical x - ray pulse length is @xmath34 at the argonne advanced photon source . for a @xmath34 x - ray pulse duration , one can probe atoms and molecules subjected to @xmath35 with millijoule laser pulse energies focused to tens of microns .",
    "shorter pulse lengths , @xmath36 , at synchrotron sources are currently available using laser slicing techniques conceived by zholents and zolotorev  @xcite and put into practice at the advanced light source  @xcite , bessy  @xcite and the swiss light source  @xcite .     and",

    "gas - phase systems are particularly suitable for illustrating the basic principles underlying laser control of ultrafast x - ray processes .",
    "we discuss two different scenarios for modifying resonant x - ray absorption near an inner - shell edge : ( 1 )  modification of electronic structure of inner - shell - excited systems by laser dressing at  @xmath40@xmath41 ; ( 2 )  control of resonant x - ray absorption by molecules through laser - induced spatial alignment at @xmath42@xmath35 .",
    "we also discuss modifications to elastic scattering patterns from an ensemble of laser - aligned molecules .",
    "another method to modify resonant x - ray absorption is through strong - field ionization of the target particles at laser intensities in the range @xmath43 @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "[ microprobe ] illustrates the microprobe and these applications .        beyond optical laser control of x - ray processes ,",

    "in this subsection we describe laser - induced modifications to x - ray absorption spectra in various rare gases .",
    "theoretical considerations are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the analogy to electromagnetically induced transparency in the optical regime and the application to imprinting ultrashort optical pulse sequences and shapes onto longer x - ray pulses .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency in the optical regime has been widely studied  @xcite . in a @xmath45-type medium characterized by atomic levels  @xmath46 , and @xmath47 with energies  @xmath48 , resonant absorption on the @xmath49  transition",
    "can be strongly suppressed by simultaneously irradiating the medium with an intense laser that couples the levels  @xmath50 and @xmath47 .",

    "for the three - level system in neon , depicted in fig .",
    "[ eit]b , the lifetime for these core - excited states is  @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , at an optical field strength sufficient to compete with inner - shell decay , multiphoton transitions to the continuum can also play a role .",
    "inner - shell decay rates are denoted by  @xmath52 and @xmath53 and multiphoton transitions to the continuum are denoted by red block arrows .    for the model system in neon ,",
    "the calculated x - ray photoabsorption cross section for  @xmath26 laser dressing of the @xmath54  transition in neon at @xmath41 with parallel and perpendicular laser / x - ray polarizations along with a fit to a three - level eit model  @xcite is reproduced here for convenience in fig .",
    "[ neoneit ] . at this intensity",
    "the @xmath55  excitation at  @xmath56 is suppressed by a factor of  13 for the configuration in which the laser and x - ray polarizations are parallel . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ neoneit ] , the three level model reproduces most features of the calculated laser - dressed x - ray photoabsorption spectrum . in the three - level model effective linewidths of  @xmath57 and @xmath58 account for the laser - ionization broadening .",
    "these parameters effectively reproduce both the lineshapes for the parallel and perpendicular configurations in the vicinity of the @xmath55  resonance .",
    "the ability to control x - ray absorption in ne at the @xmath55  resonance allows one to imprint pulses shapes of the optical dressing laser onto long x - ray pulses  @xcite .",
    "this idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ neoncell ] . with a @xmath59-long gas cell with one atmosphere of neon",
    ", the transmission of an x - ray pulse resonant with the @xmath55  transition will be only @xmath60 .",
    "a typical x - ray pulse from a synchrotron source has a duration of  @xmath34 .",
    "such an x - ray pulse may be overlapped in time and space with one or several , ultrashort intense laser pulses .",
    "those portions of the x - ray pulse that overlap with the laser are transmitted through the gas cell . in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ neoncell ] , where the two dressing laser pulses have a peak intensity of  @xmath41 , the intensity of the two transmitted x - ray pulses is roughly  @xmath61 of the incoming pulse .",
    "the time delay between the two x - ray pulses can be controlled by changing the time delay between the two laser pulses , opening a route to ultrafast all x - ray pump - probe experiments . with an analogous strategy , controlled shaping of short - wavelength pulses",
    "might become a reality .",
    "a disadvantage of this method is that it is applicable only at certain x - ray energies ; the ne case operates at  @xmath56",
    ".    it would be interesting to be able to extend these concepts to the hard x - ray regime .",
    "calculations on the laser - dressed spectra near the @xmath0  edge in krypton  @xcite and argon  @xcite have been done . in argon and krypton ,",
    "@xmath0  edges are at  @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the difficulty is that the inner shell decays are significantly more rapid ; for  ne , ar , kr the decay widths of core - excited @xmath64 levels are  @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the increased widths have two consequences .",
    "first , the @xmath68  transitions are not fully resolved as the level width increases , making it difficult to isolate a three - level system .",
    "for example , the @xmath69 , @xmath70 ,  transitions near the krypton @xmath0  edge are blended such that it is smooth edge .",
    "second , the laser intensity needed to perturb the x - ray absorption cross section roughly scales as the square of the level width .",
    "thus , when a dressing field of @xmath41 is applied , the kr  absorption cross section changes by less than  @xmath71 .",
    "one possible way to overcome these issues is to use rare gas ions as the eit  medium .",
    "the singly ionized krypton atom has a prominent , isolated resonance due to the @xmath72  hole orbital  @xcite .",
    "x - ray absorption spectra for  kr , kr@xmath73 and kr@xmath74 are shown in fig .",
    "[ krion ] .",
    "in addition to the isolated resonance , ions can withstand higher dressing intensities without ionization .",
    "the critical field strength , @xmath75 that one can apply to an atom without ionizing it can be estimated by combining the laser and coulomb potential , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the ionization potential , @xmath78 is the charge of the residual ion , @xmath79 is the electron charge  @xcite . for  kr , kr@xmath73 and",
    "kr@xmath74 the ionization potentials are  @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "thus , one should be able to apply a laser intensity  @xmath83 higher for  kr@xmath74 than neutral krypton to generate a sizable change in absorption cross section .",

    "the alignment process is of intrinsic interest and of interest in applications to spectroscopy and photophysics , quantum control of molecular dynamics , high - harmonic generation , chemical reactivity , liquids and solvation and structural determinations by x - ray or electron diffraction . for asymmetric molecules having three distinct moments of inertia ,",

    "x - ray probes of laser - aligned molecules are of considerable current interest  @xcite because of proposals to determine structure of non - periodic specimens , such as individual biomolecules , by x - ray scattering  @xcite using x - ray free electron lasers .",
    "both x - ray absorption and scattering from a randomly oriented ensemble of gas phase molecules are significantly modified if the molecules are aligned . in x - ray absorption , both the near - edge and extended structure [ extended x - ray absorption fine structure  ( exafs ) ]",
    "can be significantly altered .",
    "the near - edge structure is altered when one uses resonant polarized x - ray absorption to detect the alignment of the molecular axis relative to the lab frame  @xcite .",
    "excitation of a @xmath23  electron to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital , lumo , often results in an isolated resonance near the _ k_-edge of a molecule .",
    "the lumo is fixed relative to the molecular frame and the transition strength from a highly localized @xmath0  shell orbital to the lumo defines the alignment of the molecule relative to the x - ray polarization axis  @xcite . for the molecule that we studied , @xmath84 ,",
    "the lumo is an antibonding @xmath85  orbital with substantial br@xmath86  character , where @xmath87  refers to the c  br axis .",
    "the molecular symmetry dictates that x - ray absorption on the br@xmath88  resonance occurs only when the x - ray polarization vector has a non - vanishing projection on the c  br axis .",
    "since the laser polarization axis defines the molecular alignment axis , one achieves control of x - ray absorption by simply rotating a waveplate . after aligning in space , time and x - ray energy , i.e. ,",

    "laser control of the angle between the molecular and x - ray polarization axes will permit control of the exafs modulation amplitude , determination of the atomic background and , for more complex molecules , the determination of bond angles .",
    ".,width=288 ]    elastic scattering will also be modified since the contributions from the aligned molecules can be summed linearly and a scattering pattern reflective of the molecular structure will emerge .",
    "a simulation of the x - ray scattering pattern from an ensemble of molecules aligned by a laser pulse of arbitrary shape was made .",

    "in the previous section we have seen how it is possible to control resonant x - ray absorption with optical fields . with focused x - ray free electron lasers it will be possible to create intensities such that characteristic x - ray processes are altered .",

    "the intensity dependence is shown in fig .",
    "as one can see , hollow neon is formed preferentially at higher intensity ; indeed ne[kk ] can be the dominant species , compared to the usual @xmath113  fraction in the weak field limit . because the lcls output originates from sase ( self - amplified spontaneous emission ) , the output radiation is chaotic , consisting of a random number of intensity spikes ( coherent regions ) of random amplitude .",
    "therefore , one might expect an enhancement of two - photon processes ( such as ne[kk ] formation ) . in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ nekk ] , the auger yield from an ensemble average of chaotic pulses is compared with the yield from an average pulse shape .",
    "as one can see , the chaotic enhancement for  ne[kk ] production is at most a factor of  @xmath114 in the unsaturated regime .",
    "this is in contrast to visible radiation where one expects a factor of  2 .",
    "the critical quantity is the ratio of the fel coherence time to the auger lifetime .",
    "the larger the ratio , the closer one will be to the maximal enhancement of  2 .",
    "finally , we note that fully stripped neon can be produced in the  @xmath115 focus of the lcls beam by sequential single photon processes , providing the photon energy is greater than the binding energy of ne@xmath116  @xcite .     with @xmath117 . ]",
    "the era in which characteristic x - ray processes can be considered invariant is at an end . we have demonstrated that placing atoms and molecules in strong optical fields can significantly affect resonant absorption and elastic scattering .",
    "currently , we can control x - ray absorption with application of a strong - optical field to a gaseous medium ; the control mechanism is eit in atoms and laser - constrained rotation in molecules .",
    "one may be able to create an x - ray amplitude pulse shaper using these tools .",
    "x - ray scattering from aligned molecules is not far off ; simple estimates show that a mere @xmath118 x - rays / pulse at  @xmath29 will suffice as obtainable with a pink beam at the advanced photon source  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we look forward to being able to experimentally observe multiphoton processes in the hard x - ray regime when lcls is first operational in  2009 .",
