    "braneworld scenarios have received great attention from the physical community after addressing important problems such as gauge hierarchy rs2,add , add2 and the cosmological constant @xcite . the construction of domain walls embedded in a higher dimensional bulk , however , has a more ancient history in the literature @xcite .",
    "as is well - known , @xmath0-d branes can be classified as thin and thick ones .",
    "thin branes are constructed after introducing a tension term in the action , localized by a dirac delta function ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the mathematical formalism that describes the metric around the brane allows to obtain several interesting results in the domain of high energy physics and cosmology .",
    "usually , the issue of field localization in such branes is addressed with the help of dirac delta functions , without any clear subjacent dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "thick branes are constructed in a dynamical way after introducing one or more scalar fields coupled with gravity @xcite .",
    "thick branes are more natural in the sense that field and gravity localization can be studied with the introduction of smooth functions ( instead of dirac ones ) . moreover , the thin brane solutions are recovered in certain limits @xcite .",
    "one important issue in @xmath4-d braneworld models is to consider spacetimes with a bulk metric that extends the randall - sundrum result @xcite in a way that gravity can be localized in the @xmath5-d slice @xcite .",
    "the spacetime around the randall - sundrum brane is anti - de sitter ( @xmath6 ) , and several thick brane models ( that present this characteristic asymptotically ) have been constructed .",
    "braneworld models with one or more scalar fields were constructed in order to relate gravity localization with brane thickness @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the bloch brane model @xcite is composed of two scalar fields and is the extension for the known bloch walls @xcite in the context of braneworlds .",
    "bloch branes are stable structures that can be characterized as branes with interfaces located at the maximum of energy density .",
    "the two interfaces signals the presence of an internal structure in the brane .",
    "the presence of internal structure in topological defects was firstly considered in witten s superconducting cosmic strings @xcite . there",
    "the internal structure is provided by the condensation of a ( charged ) field over the defect . in the bloch brane case ,",
    "the appearance of internal structure is concerned with a low value of the coupling constant that guides the way the two fields interact with each other . for a stronger interaction ,",
    "a single peak for the energy density characterizes a brane with simpler structure .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that in the presence of gravity the interfaces are located more closely in the extra dimension .",
    "as such branes are able to localize gravity , one interesting question is investigating how fermionic fields may be localized . in this way",
    ", there arises the expectation that a brane with richer internal structure could provide new results when compared to a simple kinky brane .",
    "the study of fermion localization on branes hs , rds , m , drt , rpu , bgw , kk , mpt , gmt , lzd , lzz , lzwd , dg is rich and interesting . in order to localize fermions in branes",
    "one needs a coupling between the spinors and the scalar fields that form the brane .",
    "this is a condition also present in jackiw and rebbi treatment of fermion localization on solitons in flat space @xcite . in branes ,",
    "the procedure consists in separating from the full spinor one scalar coefficient with dependence only on the extra dimension , leading to a schrdinger - like equation and a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "depending on the model , one can obtain resonant massive states .",
    "in particular , the authors of @xcite analyzed the issue of fermion localization on a brane constructed with the sine - gordon potential . that work considered general fermionic yukawa couplings between one scalar field and spinorial fields .",
    "it was found that the simplest yukawa coupling @xmath7 allowed left - handed fermions to possess a zero - mode that localizes on the brane .",
    "the right - handed fermions , on the other hand , present no zero - mode .",
    "the large massive fermionic modes ( for both left and right chirality ) are plane waves and thereby are not localized on the brane .    inspired on the results obtained in @xcite",

    "2 , we present the known first - order equations for a brane model coupled with scalar fields @xcite .",

    "the schrdinger - like equation for the model is obtained and numerically solved .",

    "we investigated the occurrence of massive modes with both chiralities solving numerically the schrdinger equation and looking for zero - modes and possible resonances . for branes with internal structure",
    ", we found left- and right - handed resonances together with a zero - mode left - handed solutions .",
    "the absence of zero - mode solutions for right - handed fermions together with their findings for left - handed ones agrees with the well - known fact that massless fermions must be single - handed in a brane model @xcite . with respect to resonances for left - handed fermions",

    "iv ) the lower is the parameter @xmath62 , the higher is the mass of the the resonant mode .",
    "this means that branes with internal structure tend to trap matter with larger mass more efficiently in comparison to branes without internal structure .",
