    "creation of the compressed nuclear matter in laboratory is a hot topic in the heavy ion community for more than three decades .",
    "the main interest here is to extract the information about the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities relevant for neutron star interiors .",
    "a well established way to produce compressed nuclear matter is to collide heavy ions with high energy .",
    "however , in this case the produced system will be not only compressed , but also quite strongly excited thermally .",
    "recently several authors @xcite discussed the possibility to compress the nuclear system without much thermal excitation by implanting in it a hadron ( @xmath2 ) which has an attractive nuclear potential .",
    "it is believed that the antibaryon potentials are strongly attractive .",
    "the @xmath3-parity transformed proton potential is extremely deep : @xmath4 mev , while the phenomenological antiproton optical potential is much smaller @xmath5 mev @xcite .",
    "the static rmf calculations @xcite predict a strong nuclear compression effect by @xmath0 and @xmath6 even in the case of realistic potentials .",
    "for instance , the central nucleon density of the @xmath7o core in the ground state @xmath8o system is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "a natural question which arises here is whether the early annihilation of an antibaryon will kill the effect of compression ?",
    "a simple estimate of the stopped @xmath0 life time in nuclear matter at the normal density using vacuum annihilation cross section gives @xmath12 fm / c .",
    "the phase space volume available in the baryon - antibaryon annihilation could be , however , essentially reduced due to smaller effective masses of the annihilating pair in nuclear matter .",
    "this effect can delay the annihilation up to @xmath13 fm / c @xcite .    in this talk",
    "we will present our results of dynamical simulations of @xmath0-nuclear systems to demonstrate the compression dynamics and also to propose observable signals of possible @xmath0 annihilation in a compressed nuclear environment .",
    "[ model ] contains the short description of a model .",
    "the numerical results are collected in sect.[results ] , while the conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "here we give only a very brief review of our dynamical model .",
    "the detailed description of the gibuu model applied in calculations and of its rmf extension can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and in refs .",
    "therein .    in calculations we use the rmf lagrangian of ref .",
    "@xcite , which includes the nucleon and antinucleon fields interacting with the isoscalar - scalar @xmath14-meson field and with the isoscalar - vector @xmath15-meson field .",
    "the nl3 set of parameters was used .",
    "this set provides a good description of nuclear matter and ground states of finite nuclei .",
    "the antinucleon couplings with @xmath14- and @xmath15-fields were obtained by rescaling the nucleon coupling constants as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a scaling factor .",
    "exact @xmath3-parity transformed antinucleon scalar and vector fields are obtained by the choice @xmath19 .",
    "the antinucleon potentials consistent with the phenomenological ones are represented here by choosing @xmath20 .",
    "the dynamics of interacting nucleons and an antiproton was described within the transport gibuu model dealing with a coupled set of semiclassical kinetic equations ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the test particle technique in a parallel ensemble mode has been used to solve these equations .",
    "an antiproton was initialized according to the gaussian density distributions in coordinate and momentum space .",
    "the centroids of the gaussians were set to describe the particle at the center of a nucleus ( @xmath21 ) at rest ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "after initialization the system was left to evolve according to the kinetic equations without collision terms until @xmath0 annihilation at some preselected time moment @xmath23 . at this time a sudden annihilation of the antiproton with the closest nucleon was simulated on the basis of the string model jetset .",
    "once the annihilation is simulated , further evolution of the system of nucleons and mesons has been followed by solving the full kinetic equations including the collision terms . in this way",
    ", we have taken into account , in - particular , important processes of pion rescattering and absorption : @xmath24 or @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "first , we have studied the compression dynamics of a nucleus under the influence of an antiproton implanted in its center , completely neglecting the collision terms in kinetic equations , i.e. by taking into account the mean field only .",
    "the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_u_vs_z ] show the axial density distributions for nucleons and an antiproton at different times . in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_u_vs_z ] , the potentials defined as @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are also shown . the nucleon density at the center grows quickly reaching its maximum already at @xmath29 fm / c for the reduced @xmath0-couplings and even faster at , @xmath30 fm / c , for the @xmath3-parity - motivated couplings .",
    "the maximum nucleon density reached in this process is @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the compression of the nuclear system leads also to the growth of the antiproton density at the center .",
    "the system stabilizes on the time scale of several tens fm / c .",
    "compression process is better demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_t ] , where the central nucleon density evolution is presented for the three systems : @xmath0@xmath7o , @xmath0@xmath33ca and @xmath0@xmath34pb .",
    "for all the systems a compressed state is reached within @xmath35 fm / c and exists up to @xmath36 fm / c . at later times",
    "the stability is gradually lost due to the test particle escape beyond the computational grid .    to understand how compression can possibly influence observables , we have simulated the annihilation of an antiproton at different preselected times @xmath23 . the evolution of a central nucleon density for different @xmath23 is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_t ] .",
    "if the annihilation takes place in a compressed state , the system expands and , after @xmath37 fm / c , the central density drops below @xmath38 . for the light and medium systems , @xmath0@xmath7o and @xmath0@xmath33ca",
    ", the central nucleon density stays below @xmath39 for about @xmath40 fm / c , which is sufficient for the small density perturbations to grow according to the spinodal mechanism @xcite .",
    "this process should eventually lead to the multiple fragment formation .",
    "[ fig : ekin_spectra ] shows the kinetic energy spectra of nucleons emitted from the system after @xmath0-annihilation .",
    "they are mostly kicked - out by pion rescattering via intermediate @xmath41 resonance : @xmath24 @xcite . in the case of annihilation in the compressed state ,",
    "the nucleon spectrum acquires a high - energy tail with clearly stronger effect for lighter systems .",
    "this can be explained by the following mechanism : during the compression stage the nucleons in the central zone increase their kinetic energies due to falling down into the deep potential well created by the antiproton ( see lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_u_vs_z ] ) .",
    "after @xmath0-annihilation the potential well disappears suddenly , and the fast nucleons get released . this mechanism combined with additional kicks by pions leads to a visible enhancement of the energetic nucleon production .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : minv_spectra ] we show the distribution of annihilation events in the total invariant mass @xmath42 of emitted mesons . in the absence of any in - medium effects",
    ", this distribution should be sharply peaked at @xmath43 .",
    "the final state interactions of mesons , i.e. rescattering and absorption on nucleons , lead to the strong spreading of the distribution toward smaller @xmath42 .",
    "additionally , the mean - field effects reduce the invariant energy @xmath44 of annihilating @xmath0-nucleon pair as @xmath45 .",
    "this further shifts the distribution to smaller @xmath42 .",
    "the effect is especially strong for annihilations in compressed configurations .",
    "the above results have been obtained for the artificial case of an antiproton sitting at rest in the center of a nucleus .",
    "it is , certainly , more realistic to study the compression of the nucleus induced by moving @xmath0 . as an example",
    ", we have considered the central @xmath0@xmath46c collision at @xmath47 mev . in order to compute the mean field ,",
    "we have performed simulations for 1000 parallel ensembles of test particles .",
    "the probability of @xmath0-annihilation within the time interval @xmath48 was calculated as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the annihilation width and @xmath51 fm / c is the time step of the simulation . in each run , the annihilation time for all parallel ensembles has been chosen randomly using @xmath52 .",
    "further details of the model implementation for the @xmath0-induced reactions on nuclei will be published elsewhere .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoz_pbarc12_180mev_coh ] we show the density distributions of nucleons and of the antiproton along the beam axis for 20 computed runs .",
    "one can see that in 19 runs the antiproton annihilation happened at the periphery of the nucleus . and",
    "only in a single run the antiproton has safely reached the central zone . in this run",
    ", the nucleon density has been increased up to @xmath53 by moving @xmath0 .",
    "this means that with @xmath54 probability one can expect the compression effect even in realistic central @xmath0-nucleus collisions .",
    "to summarise , we have performed the dynamical rmf calculations of the cold compression of nuclei by an antiproton implanted in their centers .",
    "the calculations in a pure mean field mode resulted in a fast increase of the central nucleon density up to @xmath55 within the time interval of @xmath1 fm / c . without annihilation ,",
    "the system stabilizes in a compressed state , which has been numerically traced until 100 fm / c .",
    "the density profiles of compressed @xmath0-nuclear systems are close to the ones obtained earlier by static rmf calculations @xcite .    due to in - medium effects , the @xmath0 annihilation can be suppressed . in this case the time needed for a compression can be comparable with the life time of an antiproton with respect to the annihilation . therefore , the compression can , indeed , manifest itself in some @xmath0-nucleus collision events before the antiproton annihilation .    it has been demonstrated , that the events with nuclear compression have a probability of few percent even in @xmath0(180 mev)+@xmath46c central collisions . at higher energies ,",
    "the fraction of the compression events is expected to be higher due to smaller @xmath0-nucleon annihilation cross section .    in the present calculations",
    "we have used quite moderate values for the attractive real part of @xmath0 optical potential .",
    "actual determination of @xmath56 requires a very careful comparison with experimental data on elastic and inelastic scattering and absorption of antiprotons on nuclei .",
    "we propose to perform such measurements at the future fair facility in darmstadt . in this respect",
    "we find very promising to use the event - by - event transverse momentum correlations proposed recently to determine the @xmath6 optical potential @xcite .",
    "we believe that the same method can also be applied for the determination of the @xmath0 optical potential .",
