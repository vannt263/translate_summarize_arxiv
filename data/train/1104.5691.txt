    "the link between nearby gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and peculiar type ib / c supernovae ( or hypernovae ) ambiguously shows that some populations of grbs are born from the catastrophic death of massive stars .",
    "observations of host galaxies of grbs also lead to the general consensus that grbs are generated preferentially in low metallicity star - forming regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar evolutions at low metallicity are believed to suppress the mass loss , so that the star can maintain its own angular momentum . as a result , the iron core of these stars would be rapidly spinning , which would be a necessary condition for producing grbs in the collapsar @xcite or magnetar models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to these facts , it is widely recognized that rapidly rotating wolf - rayet stars in low metallicity regions are the most favored progenitors for grbs .    the first star ( hereafter pop iii )",
    "also potentially creates grb .",
    "the first star is supposed to be formed with a huge mass ( @xmath4 ) @xcite and a rapid rotation with nearly breakup speed @xcite .",
    "the gravitational collapse of these stars would result in a black hole formation @xcite and potentially a central engine activity @xcite .",
    "if the primordial gas is ionized by radiation from first - generation metal - free ( pop iii.1 ) stars , the subsequent metal - free ( pop iii.2 ) stars would be less massive @xcite .",
    "it is also recently discussed that the radiative feedback could reduce the mass of the first star via the hii region breakout and the photoevaporation of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "although the reduced mass @xmath5 is quite lower than previously thought , the light pop iii star still has enough large mantles for the formation of a black hole .",
    "thus , even in these cases , the central engine could operate as a result of the core collapse in the standard collapsar model .",
    "the pop iii grbs and their afterglows are detectable in principle up to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , providing powerful probes of the high redshift universe @xcite . however , even if the central engine successfully operates , it is still a matter of debate whether the jet can produce grb or not .",
    "one of the main obstacles for producing grbs is the stellar envelope that may prevent the jet propagations .",
    "if the central engine turns off well before the jet head reaches the stellar surface , all of the jet matter undergoes the dissipation by the reverse shock wave and it will eventually expand spherically .",
    "in addition , the outflow is contaminated by a huge amount of baryon , so it is naturally expected that its velocity becomes non - relativistic and never creates grbs . in this expectation ,",
    "@xcite constrained the progenitors of grbs assuming that the lifetime of the central engine is comparable to the observed duration of the prompt phase of grbs .",
    "he concluded that only compact carbon - oxygen wolf - rayet stars satisfy the condition for producing grbs , meanwhile very massive stars such as pop iii stars are not suitable .    on the contrary , @xcite recently pointed out that the jet breakout is possible even if the pop iii star has a supergiant hydrogen envelope without mass loss , thanks to the long - lived powerful accretion of the envelope itself .",
    "they analytically show that the jet successfully penetrates the pop iii as well as compact wolf - rayet stars if the envelope keeps to fall in a black hole and the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency is larger than a certain level .    however , it is not trivial that the envelope can keep to fall and accrete to a black hole or not .",
    "generally , the core collapse produces rarefaction waves , which propagate outwards through the envelope and induce the infall of the stellar envelope ( see * ? ? ?",
    "but some portions of envelope cease to fall due to the jet propagations when the central engine starts to operate .",
    "although almost every matter could be accreted from the equatorial regions , the feedback would strongly affect the accretion rate if the jet opening angle is large .",
    "the jet feedback to the accretions has not been taken into account in previous studies on accretion processes onto a black hole @xcite , since these processes are supposed to be complex and strongly non - linear phenomena , the hydrodynamic simulations with both accretions and jet propgations are strongly required .",
    "on the other hand , a large number of numerical studies on the jet propagations in the stellar mantle have been carried out @xcite .",
    "however , almost all works assume that the jet is injected with a constant energy flux from a certain radius of the inner boundary .",
    "although we do not still know the mechanism of the central engine , it is naturally expected that the jet luminosity would correlate with the accretion rate in one way or another @xcite .",
    "thus , the jet luminosity would be a function of the accretion rate .",
    "we also expect that the jet production could be ceased by the reduction of the accretion due to the negative feedback as mentioned above . in the previous study",
    ", @xcite demonstrated the jet propagations with the jet powers as a function of the accretion rates .",
    "however , they calculated the jet propagation and the fall back process separately , and can not address the jet feedback process adequately . in the other previous studies ,",
    "@xcite recently investigated the time variable jet injections , but the luminosity and time variability are determined by a hand .",
    "in order to investigate how the jet propagations give the feedback on the accretion process , it is necessary to perform the numerical simulations in both the collapsing phase and the jet propagation phase at once .    motivated by these facts",
    ", we perform the two - dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations for the envelope collapse and the jet propagation in a single computation .",
    "the purpose of this study is to clarify whether the forward shock wave successfully propagates and breaks out from the various types of the stellar progenitors for grbs or not , taking into account the jet feedback process , and to discuss the possibility of grbs .",
    "we survey the parameter space of the jet opening angle and the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency , and discuss how these key quantities affect the jet dynamics to obtain the simple analytical criteria of the possibility of grbs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describes the models and methods in this paper .",
    "then , our results will be presented with detailed analysis in section 3 .",
    "finally , we devote to discuss our findings and conclude the paper in section 4 . in this paper",
    ", we employ the geometrical units .",
    "the numerical code employed in this paper is essentially the same as those used in @xcite , in which all the details about our numerical codes and various test calculations are presented .",
    "here we briefly summarize the methods and set up in this study .",
    "our numerical code solves the relativistic hydrodynamic equations with weak gravitational field . the self gravity is included in the weak field approximation of einstein equation .",
    "it should be noted that , due to our computational limitations , we cut the inner portions of the star from a certain radius .",
    "the gravity in this region is added as that of a point mass at the center by integrating the mass flux at the inner boundary .",
    "based on the above assumptions , the gravity is solved by using miccg methods .",
    "the hydrodynamical parts are solved by using the so - called central scheme , which guarantees a good accuracy even if the flow involves strong shock waves and the flow velocity is highly relativistic @xcite .",
    "we use the ppm interpolation method and tvd runge - kutta time integration which achieve the second order accuracy in both space and time . in this study",
    ", we adopt the @xmath8-law equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the pressure , adiabatic index , rest mass density and specific internal energy , respectively , in all our computations .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt three representative stellar progenitors , which are ( 1 ) wolf - rayet star ( 16ti in @xcite , hereafter wr ) , ( 2 ) light pop iii star @xmath14 , which is the metal free pre - supernova model calculated by @xcite ( hereafter lpop3 ) , and ( 3 ) massive pop iii star @xmath15 @xcite ( hereafter mpop3 ) .",
    "the density profile of each stellar model is displayed in figure  [ f1 ] , and the stellar mass and radius are also summarized in table  [ tab1 ] . since this study is the first attempt for the accretion - powered jet propagations , we neglect the stellar rotations just for simplicity although these progenitors are supposed to spin rapidly to operate the central engine .",
    "note that we are in the same stand point as in the previous study @xcite , that the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency parameter absorbs this uncertainty .",
    "more detailed studies for the effects of rotations will be presented in the forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "we map the spherical symmetric progenitors into two - dimensional grids in spherical coordinates .",
    "the computational domain for each stellar progenitor covers from a certain inner radius to the stellar surface .",
    "although the inner boundary should be located in the vicinity of a black hole ( around @xmath16 ) , this is computationally very expensive .",
    "we set the inner boundary somewhat far from a black hole . according to this limitation ,",
    "our discussions in the present paper are at the qualitative level .",
    "for all models , the total number of standard radial grid points is 500 .",
    "the grid width is non - uniform and increasing in geometric progression @xcite .",
    "the innermost grid width is set as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the location of inner boundary .",
    "then , the geometrical increasing rate is determined so as to cover all stellar regions with 500 meshes .",
    "the angular grid covers a quadrant of the meridian section ( where we assume the equatorial symmetry ) and is uniform with 60 grid points .",
    "we employ an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) technique in order to decrease the computational cost .",
    "we deploy two levels of meshes as in @xcite , where the resolution of the second level is 3 times finer in each direction than the first standard mesh . in order to check the dependence on the resolution",
    ", we also carry out finer amr calculations .",
    "we check calculations with 5 times and 7 times finer amr meshes for wr models , and 7 times for other progenitor models .",
    "we confirm that the resolution does not change our main findings in this study .",
    "note that in table 3 , the `` amr level '' denotes the multiplying factor of the fine meshes .",
    "we assume that the central engine successfully operates and the well confined outflows are produced in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "we inject the plasma in the radial direction through the inner boundary with several degrees of opening angle . in this paper",
    ", we also assume that the jet luminosity depends only on the accretion rate which is estimated by the mass flows across through the inner boundary ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the location of the inner boundary and the radial velocity of flows .",
    "we inject an outflow with a luminosity , @xmath22 where @xmath0 is the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency parameter .",
    "the conversion efficiency , jet opening angle , specific internal energy and radial velocity are varied in each model .",
    "once these parameters are fixed , the density and pressure of injected jets are determined by using the relation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the specific enthalpy and the area of the injection surface , respectively .",
    "the collapse of the massive envelope is induced by the same way as in @xcite . in reality , the stellar envelope starts to fall after the arrival of rarefaction waves that are generated by the inner core collapse .",
    "we mimic this situation by putting the radial gradient of all quantities to zero at the boundary except for the jet injected regions . at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the break of the force balance at the inner boundary induces the infall of matter .",
    "subsequently a rarefaction wave propagates outwards , inducing the infall at point when it reaches .",
    "it should be noted , however , stellar progenitors used in this paper , especially the wr progenitor , are not exactly in the dynamical equilibrium , in contrast to @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the outer parts of the envelope begin to move and the several artificial waves are observed during the simulations .",
    "we find that they induce artificial explosions in some models ( but only for non - successful shock break out models ) .",
    "it is attributed that the wr stellar model , for example , originally involves the rotation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the centrifugal force works to sustain the stellar configurations .",
    "since we artificially remove the rotation , the envelope tends to infall and induce artificial compressions and bounces .",
    "we note that even the original 16ti model is not an exact configuration of the dynamical equilibrium .",
    "contrary to @xcite , we do not take special treatments for the initial stellar configurations here .",
    "we also investigate the dependence on the timing of the jet injection , since we still have few constrains on the starting time of the central engine .",
    "if the operation of the central engine is sufficiently delayed , the density profile of the stellar envelope is changed by the accretion .",
    "thus , it is expected that the jet dynamics also depend on the timing of the jet injection .",
    "in addition , we would like to investigate whether the later jet can really accomplish the shock breakout since the large mass accretion may prevent the jet propagations in this case .",
    "motivated by these facts , we initially let the stellar envelope spherically collapse , and then inject a relativistic jet with a certain time delay . we carry out these simulations only in wr models because the enclosed mass at the inner boundary for our reference model is @xmath26 , which may be lower than the critical mass of the black hole formation @xcite . as a result , it is quite likely that the central engine does not operate for a while . on the other hand ,",
    "the pop iii models have so massive enclosed mass at the inner boundary ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) that the central engine would begin soon after the collapse in our models .",
    "we prepare two models , wrm3 and wrm6 models , which inject the jet when the enclosed mass at the inner boundary reaches @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding time of injection for each model is @xmath29s and @xmath30s , respectively .",
    "the radial density profiles just before the jet injection are displayed in fig  [ f2 ] for these models .",
    "all of our models used in this paper are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we prepare a reference model for each progenitor with the following parameters .",
    "the inner boundary locates at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the stellar radius . the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency ( @xmath0 ) , half opening angle of outflows ( @xmath1 ) , injected lorentz factor ( @xmath33 ) , injected specific internal energy ( @xmath34 )",
    "are set as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "note that these models assume that the injected jet has already reached to the terminal lorentz factor .",
    "it may not be true for wr models since the inner boundary locates at somewhat closer to the black hole than the other progenitor models .",
    "however , as we shall see , if the choice of the terminal lorentz factor is the same , the overall profiles of jet dynamics do not depend on whether the jet injection is kinetic dominant or thermal dominant ( we demonstrate @xmath39 cases in wrlo5 and wrlo50 models ) . in order to study the dependence on the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency , we varies it as @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( models such as wref ... , lpop3ef ... , mpop3ef ... ) , while other parameters are identical to the reference model .",
    "we also study the dependence on the half opening angle with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the study for the injection timing is done only in wr progenitor as wrm3 and wrm6 models .",
    "as we have already mentioned , we check the dependence on the location of the inner boundary ( models such as wrin ... , lpop3 in ... , mpop3 in ... ) and we also conduct the resolution checks ( models such as wrreso ... , lpop3reso ... , mpop3reso ... ) .",
    "in this section , we describe the numerical results obtained from our hydrodynamic simulations and analyze them in detail .",
    "we first explain overall features of the jet dynamics , and then we further analyze the dependence on each parameter and model .",
    "we also present a simple analytic criteria for the possibility of grbs at the end .",
    "we summarize numerical results in table  [ tab3 ] . here",
    ", we define the shock breakout when the forward shock wave successfully reaches the stellar surface",
    ". it should be noted , however , the shock breakout is a minimal requirement for producing grbs .",
    "as we shall see , even if the outflow successfully accomplishes the breakout , some models are not suitable for grbs ( see the column of `` _ _ possibility of grb _ _ '' in table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "we assess the possibility of grb by the diagnostic terminal lorentz factor @xmath44 profiles on z - axis at the time of the shock breakout . if there are regions where @xmath45 is satisfied , we determine that the model has a potential to produce grbs .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , it means that the jet is not successfully injected or does not move forward . as a result",
    ", the explosion would never become relativistic enough , i.e. the flow is optically thick to gamma - rays without grbs .",
    "note that some models are hard to be judged for the possibility of grbs because of several reasons ( see the column of `` _ _ possibility of grb _ _ '' in table  [ tab3 ] and we describe these models as @xmath46 ) .",
    "the details of these models are presented in the following subsections .",
    "one of the remarkable results in this study is that many models successfully accomplish the relativistic shock breakout even though the progenitor star has an extremely large envelope ( such as mpop3 models ) .",
    "these results are the numerical verification of @xcite .",
    "we will further analyze the dependencies on the efficiency @xmath0 and the opening angle @xmath1 in the following section .",
    "indeed , the jet dynamics strongly depend on these key parameters .    at the beginning of simulations ,",
    "the infall starts at the innermost regions and subsequently a rarefaction wave propagates outwards . the accretion rate increases with time and then the injected energy generates the forward shock wave around the polar regions .",
    "it should be noted , however , the forward shock wave does not propagate outward into the active computational regions for a while because of the interruption by the infalling matter .",
    "if the injected energy is not enough to push an infalling stellar mantle aside , the mantle advects inwards and eventually it is swallowed into a black hole . as a result , the total amount of explosion energy becomes less than the injected energy .",
    "furthermore , the binding energy by a black hole ( and also the progenitor star itself ) further reduces the explosion energy .",
    "we also calculate the diagnostic energy @xmath47 at the time of the shock breakout in each model and show them in 5th rows at table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "we define the diagnostic energy @xmath47 as the integral of @xmath48 ( local energy density ) , which is the sum of the internal , kinetic and gravitational energy density , over the regions with positive @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath47 is not the isotropic energy but collimation - corrected true energy . in the weak gravitational field limit",
    ", we can define @xmath48 as ; @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the time - time component of energy momentum tensor and gravitational potential , respectively . as you can see in table  [ tab3 ] , we find that the diagnostic energy for all models is about less than a third of the injected energy .",
    "thus , it implies that the central engine has to produce larger amount of energy than that observed as grbs",
    ".    the total amount of explosion energy would be larger than the diagnostic energy @xmath47 at the breakout since the central engine is able to keep operations after the shock breakout due to the continuing accretion .",
    "indeed , as we shall see in the following subsections , some models are active at the time of the breakout .",
    "thus , although @xmath47 may be lower than the typical grb energy in some models , the outflows would gain further energy from the central engine to create grbs after the breakout .",
    "when the injected energy is successfully launched from the inner boundary , some portions of matter bounce back and move outwards .",
    "however , we can not see a clear collimated outflow at the beginning of the simulations even if we inject kinetic dominant outflows in a small opening angle .",
    "this is due to the fact that the injected energy is thermalized by the strong reverse shock wave in the vicinity of the inner boundary . as a result ,",
    "the hot matter expands and create a quasi - spherical forward shock wave .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the forward shock wave is not strong enough to cease the infall of matter around the equatorial region and the matter keeps to accrete through the inner boundary .",
    "the jet structure emerges when the injected energy becomes enough to push back the reverse shock wave outside the computational region .",
    "subsequent evolutions are similar to the previous studies of the jet propagations .",
    "the hot cocoons cause the recollimation shock waves , and strong backflows also appear in the flows and they sometimes pinch the jet .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability also works to create rich internal structures .",
    "the jet starts to proceed and the forward shock wave eventually breaks out of the stellar surface .",
    "we would like to point out that the injected energy from the central engine may contribute to the explosion energy of the supernova component , if the hot cocoon mainly contributes to the supernova , i.e. , an almost spherical shock wave accompanying a large amount of nickel production .",
    "if the strong reverse shock wave is still stagnated around the root of the jet at the time of the shock breakout , the kinetic energy of the jet keeps to be converted into the thermal energy in the deep inside of the stellar mantle .",
    "although the cocoon pressure would decrease after the shock breakout and make it easy for the reverse shock wave to proceed , the jet luminosity is also reduced as the accretion rate decreases , so that the reverse shock wave may stay deep inside the star . if this is the case , the injected energy may work for expelling the stellar mantle rather than for contributing the grb components .",
    "however , at the present time , it is unclear how large amount of nickel is created in the hot cocoon , so we do not know whether they create the supernova or not .",
    "we will address these issues in the forthcoming paper .",
    "it is also interesting to note that if the stellar envelope consists of multi - layerd configurations ( such as onion like structure ) , the accretion rate also changes across the different layer . in our simulations , the rapid decline of the accretion rate",
    "can be seen due to the discontinuous decline of the density at the boundary of the shell ( see e.g. fig  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "the change of the accretion rate may cause the time variability of the central engine .",
    "the variability timescale depends on the initial location of the shell boundaries and roughly corresponds to the free fall timescale at this region .",
    "it should be noted that the stellar rotation may play an important role on this matter for the realistic situation since the specific angular momentum also discontinuously changes at the shell and it may fluctuate the accretion rate .",
    "the angular momentum is generally an increasing function of radius in each shell , but it discontinuously drop at the shell boundary . as a result ,",
    "the centrifugal force is reduced in strength there and it may potentially increase the accretion rate .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab3 ] , we find that the forward shock wave can break out if the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency is @xmath53 ( see more details in the subsection [ sec : ana ] ) . figure  [ f3 ] displays the time evolution of the forward shock wave on z - axis for models with different efficiency . as expected , the higher conversion efficiency generates stronger shock wave and it quickly propagates into the stellar envelope . in the case of lower conversion efficiency models ,",
    "however , it is harder to inject the jet .",
    "even if the jet is successfully injected , it takes longer time for the forward shock wave to reach the stellar surface than the high efficiency models .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows the time evolution of the accretion rate and luminosity in these models ( note that we also display the results for the failed models without breakouts ) . at the initial phase ,",
    "the higher efficiency models have slightly smaller accretion rates than the lower efficiency models because the strong outflows interrupt the infall of matter .",
    "still , the high efficiency models have higher jet luminosity than the low efficiency models . as a result",
    ", the jet successfully gains the energy from the central engine and accomplishes the shock breakout .",
    "it is also interesting to note that low efficiency models often show the rapid time variability of the accretion rate ( see e.g. wref2e-4 model in the upper left panel in figure  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "it is attributed to the fallback of the shocked envelope , which have rich internal structures .",
    "although the envelope initially expands due to the deposited energy , they do not have enough energy to keep outwards and they eventually fall back through the inner boundary , leading to the central engine activity .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows the map of regions with positive @xmath48 and @xmath49 at the time of the shock breakout .",
    "we can see that the shape of the yellow region , which contains both positive @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq;elc ] ) ) , does not depend on the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency @xmath0 so much .",
    "irrespective of @xmath0 , the maximum transverse radius of the yellow region from z - axis is @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 for wr , lpop3 and mpop3 models , respectively .",
    "it may imply that the outflow structure does not mainly depend on the efficiency @xmath0 , as long as the shock breakout occurs ( see also the next subsection ) . from this figure",
    ", we can also confirm that even the large efficiency jet does not expel all portions of the stellar mantle , and the matter can keep to accrete onto the black hole . on the other hand , the inner parts of the envelope profiles depend on the efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "as expected , a larger amount of matter is captured for the lower conversion efficiency .",
    "in addition , as discussed above , the fallback of the matter causes the late time variability of the central engine .    in figure  [ f6 ]",
    ", we show the diagnostic terminal lorentz factor @xmath57 profiles along z - axis at the time of the shock breakout for each model .",
    "the model has a possibility of grb if @xmath45 is satisfied in some region .",
    "so we use this condition to assess whether the model can create grb or not .",
    "we note that the reality is more complex as argued in the following . in figure",
    "[ f6 ] , the outer region tends to contain lower values of @xmath58 , even less than @xmath59 .",
    "however we consider that these outflows would create grbs for the high efficiency models ( @xmath35 ) because the central engine keeps operating after the shock breakout for these models .",
    "the inner fast moving jets would eventually catch up the outer slowly moving ejecta . due to this energy input from the inner jets ,",
    "it is quite likely that the actual terminal lorentz factor of the outer outflows is larger than the values of the current estimation of the diagnostic terminal lorentz factor .",
    "thus we expect the relativistic explosions in these models .",
    "however , it is less likely that the low efficiency models such as lpop3ef-4 , lpop3ef2 - 4 and mpop3ef2 - 4 can successfully gain the energy from later jets .",
    "even if the central engine keeps operating for a long time , they may not be able to accelerate outflows because the amount of the outer slow matter is large ( the profile @xmath60 deviates from the high efficiency models ) in these models . as a result",
    ", the energy of jet is dissipated in the vicinity of the injection region without transferring the energy into the outer parts of the ejecta . according to this consideration , we regard that these low efficiency models would end up with the non - relativistic explosions and may not create grbs ( thus , we mark triangles ( @xmath46 ) for these models in the column `` _ _ possibility of grb _ _ '' of table  [ tab3 ] . ) .",
    "we note that if the reverse shock is stalled near the injection region at the time of the shock breakout , there is no hope for this reverse shock to go ahead afterward because the accretion rate is decreasing .",
    "figure  [ f7 ] shows the time evolution of the forward shock wave on z - axis for models with different opening angle jet injections .",
    "generally , the forward shock wave propagates fast and succeeds to break out if the opening angle is small .",
    "it is mainly attributed to two reasons .",
    "one reason is that the isotropic flux is increased by the small cross - sectional area of the injected jet , and the other is the increment of the accretion rate .",
    "a wide opening angle tends to interrupt the accretions and reduce the jet power ( see figure  [ f8 ] ) .",
    "note that the overall dynamics for very wide opening angle jets ( e.g. @xmath61 and @xmath43 ) are more complex than the collimated jets .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f7 ] , the jet breakout time for @xmath62 models are ( slightly ) earlier than @xmath63 models in all types of progenitors .",
    "it is because the fall back process plays an important role for wider jets by enhancing the accretion rate . indeed , for wrop45 , the accretion rate reaches @xmath64 at @xmath65 s , and leads to the strong outflows from the inner boundary and finally to the shock breakout .",
    "thus , the late time activity of the central engine is possible for a wide opening angle due to the strong fallback accretions , even though the mean accretion rate decreases with time in the late phase .",
    "( but these wide opening angle jets are not suitable to produce the relativistic outflows , see below ) .    in figure  [ f9 ] , we display the time evolution of the forward shock wave for the different angle radial rays from the symmetry axis . for reference models",
    "( left panels in this figure ) , the forward shock velocity decreases with increasing angle . in particularly ,",
    "at the time of the shock breakout , we find that the forward shock waves along the off - axis radial ray are still deep inside the star , which means that the outflow is well collimated . on the other hand , for @xmath63 models , almost all models experience the quasi - spherical evolutions .",
    "although the shock wave on z - axis is slightly faster than the off - axis shock waves , it is much more spherical than the reference model at the breakout . as a result",
    ", it is expected that the wide opening angle models never create grbs in view of the spherical morphology of the outflows .",
    "figure  [ f10 ] is the same as figure  [ f5 ] , but for different opening angles .",
    "we do not find any clear differences for narrow opening angle jet models ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , so we do not display these models in this figure .",
    "as shown in this figure , the wider jet tends to expel larger outer envelope , and clearly these profiles are different from each other . also we again see that very wide angle cases are very complicated .",
    "interestingly , some fraction of stellar mantle around the equatorial region may never fall back to the black hole ( see @xmath68 models ) . from what has been discussed above",
    ", we can conclude that the outflow profile is mainly determined by the opening angle of the jet @xmath1 rather than the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency @xmath0 ( see also figure  [ f5 ] and discussions in subsection  [ subsecdepeoneff ] ) .",
    "the diagnostic terminal lorentz factor profiles along the z - axis for different opening angle models are shown in figure  [ f11 ] . for small opening angle models ( @xmath69 ) ,",
    "the diagnostic terminal lorentz factor is not so much different ( slightly larger value for wider opening angle ) .",
    "however , the profile of very wide models are completely different from narrow jet cases and the terminal lorentz factor for the wide angle models are quite low .",
    "thus , they are no longer capable of producing grbs .",
    "note that , although the jet of mpop3op36 model is successfully injected around the inner boundary ( see in figure  [ f11 ] ) , this outflow may not create grbs since the outer ejecta is completely non - relativistic @xmath70 and the outflow configuration is not collimated . as a result ,",
    "a small opening angle @xmath71 is necessary for the relativistic shock breakout and grbs for the case @xmath72 .",
    "note that if the efficiency becomes lower than @xmath35 , the opening angle needs to be smaller than the current value , because the low efficiency jet is harder to push aside the infall matter than the high efficiency jet ( see  [ sec : ana ] for the analytic estimation of the breakout criteria ) .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss how the injection lorentz factor and the jet injection timing affect the evolution of the jet . in figure",
    "[ f12 ] , we display time evolutions of some key quantities , such as the forward shock wave on the z - axis , the mass accretion rate and the power of the injected jet .",
    "as we can see , the injection lorentz factor does not change the qualitative feature of the jet evolutions for all quantities as long as the final coasting lorentz factor is the same ( see left panels in figure  [ f12 ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the jet dynamics depend on the timing of the jet injection ( see right panels in figure  [ f12 ] ) .",
    "we can see that the late injection leads to slightly fast evolutions than the early injection , and also that the time evolution of the accretion rate and the jet luminosity is quite different in the early phase .",
    "this is because the accretion rate is already high at the time of the jet injection for the late injection . as a result ,",
    "the strong jet is injected and evolves faster than the early injection case .",
    "it should be noted that although the late jet injection slightly interrupts the infall of the material ( see middle and right panel of figure  [ f12 ] ) , it does not cease the accretion of all the infall material .",
    "we also speculate that a wide opening angle would suppress the infall of matter more strongly , so that the collimated outflows are preferred for grbs even in the late injection cases .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the diagnostic terminal lorentz factor @xmath74 profile for the different timing of the jet injection as displayed in figure  [ f13 ] .",
    "as we can see in this figure , the late jet injection tends to have higher diagnostic terminal lorentz factor than the early jet injection .",
    "this is also because the power of later jet is stronger than the one of earlier jet ( see bottom panel of figure  [ f12 ] ) .",
    "the strong forward shock waves propagate outwards and the outer envelope obtains large energy from them .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the later jet injection is more suitable for producing grbs than the earlier one .",
    "it should be noted , however , too late injection may not be suitable for grbs since the accretion rate becomes very weak and also some centrifugal bounce takes place at the late time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . although we do not know exactly the starting time of the central engine , we speculate that the most plausible starting timing for the central engine is the time when the accretion disk is formed around a black hole .",
    "it clearly depends on the angular momentum distribution of the progenitor star , so we will investigate this dependence by performing the rotational collapse of progenitor stars in the forthcoming paper @xcite .      here",
    "we check the dependence on the resolutions in figure  [ f14 ] and on the inner boundary location in figure  [ f15 ] for our simulations . as we can see in figure  [ f14 ] , the time evolutions of the jet and luminosity are almost the same for different resolution models . thus the resolution dependence is very weak and does not affect our findings .",
    "note that the higher resolution case has slightly faster shock breakout . at the first face",
    ", it seems to be inconsistent with previous studies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which show that the lower resolution leads to slightly faster head velocity and breakout . however the previous results are valid only for the constant jet injection . in this calculation , the power of the injected outflow is a function of the accretion and so time - dependent .",
    "figure  [ f15 ] shows the dependence on the inner boundaries for the evolution of the forward shock wave on the z - axis and the jet luminosities .",
    "although we confirm that the location of the inner boundary strongly affects the jet dynamics , the effect is quite systematic : the forward shock wave becomes fast and the luminosity becomes large if we put the inner boundary on a small radius .",
    "this is because the matter falls fast into the inner boundary if the boundary is small .",
    "consequently the total mass accretion rate increases and thereby the jet power becomes large with a strong forward shock wave . according to these results ,",
    "it is a robust claim that the shock breakout is possible if the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency is larger than @xmath75 ( see more details in the subsection [ sec : ana ] ) . in order for more quantitative arguments",
    ", we should perform the jet simulation from a small radius .      in this subsection",
    ", we compare our numerical results with the analytic estimate of the shock breakout in @xcite .",
    "since setups are rather different between this numerical study and their analytic one , we concentrate on the parameter dependence of the successful relativistic shock breakout .",
    "they derived the timescale of the shock breakout ( @xmath76 ; eq .",
    "12 in their paper ) and the free - fall timescale of the envelope materials , i.e. , the duration of the accretion - powered jet ( @xmath77 ; eq . 15 ) .",
    "when @xmath76 is shorter than @xmath77 , the jet successfully arrives at the stellar surface and the relativistic shock breakout takes place . employing their eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 15 ) , we can derive the criteria for the successful relativistic shock breakout as @xmath78 where @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for mpop3 and wr and @xmath81 for lpop3 ) is an index for the density profile of the stellar envelope , @xmath82 with the stellar radius @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the prefactor @xmath84 depends on the stellar radius , the core mass and the envelope mass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is found to be of order unity , typically around @xmath85 for mpop3 according to @xcite . in this paper , we find that @xmath86 is suitable for explaining the numerical results of mpop3 .",
    "the reason for the difference in @xmath84 is that some of assumptions in @xcite are violated , that is , they assumed a conical jet propagation ( i.e. , @xmath1 is independent of the radius ; see @xcite ) and neglected the negative feedback from the cocoon to the accretion rate .",
    "the breakout condition is also not exactly the same between the analtic and numerical calculations .",
    "nevertheless it is encouraging that both results coincide within a numerical factor . in figure",
    "[ f16 ] we present @xmath87 diagrams to compare our numerical results with the analytic criteria in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tff_tb ] ) ( black solid line ) . the circles , triangles and crosses in this figure correspond to the column of `` _ _ possibility of grb _ _ '' in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "we use @xmath88 1.4 , 1.2 and 1.0 for wr , lpop3 and mpop3 , respectively . as we can see from figure [ f16 ] , the analytical criteria in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tff_tb ] ) and @xcite are useful to forecast the penetrability of the relativistic jet and the possible grb production in massive star models .",
    "we can predict the parameter space where grbs could occur in @xmath87 plane once we calibrate @xmath84 with numerical simulations .",
    "we find @xmath89 in our simulations , so that we can transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : tff_tb ] ) into a much simpler form @xmath90    this would be helpful for the study of the central engine to judge whether the jet really pierces the massive stellar envelope and produce grbs or not .",
    "note that the equation ( [ eq : tff_tb ] ) , i.e. , @xmath91 is just the necessary condition for the shock breakout .",
    "for example , a wide jet fails to breakout because the reverse shock wave does not propagate outward or the shocked matter can not go sideways into the cocoon component .",
    "nevertheless the criteria in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tff_tb ] ) is applicable to a wide range of parameters of interest .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the propagations of the accretion - powered jets in pop iii and present - day stellar progenitors ( wolf - rayet stars ) .",
    "we perform two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations taking into account both the envelope collapse and the jet propagations for the first time .",
    "the main findings in this paper are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "although some portions of matter cease to fall and go outward by the energy injection from the polar region , a large amount of matter keeps accreting into the black hole , so that the central engine can continue to inject outflows .",
    "2 .   if the central engine satisfies a certain condition ( see below ) , the jet can succeed to propagate and relativistically break out of various types of progenitors for grbs , especially the massive ( @xmath92 ) pop iii stars , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we numerically verify that the central engine can last very long @xmath93 s for massive pop iii stars because of the accretion of the huge envelope .",
    "3 .   there is a possibility of grb if the accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency satisfies @xmath94 as derived in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tff_tb ] ) and ( [ eq : criteria ] ) .",
    "otherwise the injection energy results in the non - relativistic explosion or advection into a black hole .",
    "we find that the jet dynamics depends on the timing of the jet injection . for late jets",
    ", the diagnostic terminal lorentz factor tends to be higher value than that for earlier jets because the rarefaction wave reduces the central density and the strong jet is injected .",
    "thus we can conclude that the late jet injection is more suitable for producing grbs than the early one .",
    "note that the current criteria for the possibility of grbs is only adequate for the judgment whether the relativistic shock breakout can really take place or not .",
    "needless to say , this is only the necessary condition for the production of grbs , i.e , some models which satisfies the above criteria may fail to produce grbs .",
    "one of the most ambiguity in this study is how large amount of energy can be provided to the outer ejecta by the central engine activity after the shock breakout .",
    "it depends on the evolution of accretion rate . in order to investigate the late evolution ,",
    "further long time simulations are definitely required .    as mentioned already",
    ", the rotation profile of the stellar progenitor may also affect the possibility of grbs , since the rotation may determine the starting time of the central engine .",
    "besides , there is no guarantee that the jet power is proportional to the accretion rate as assumed in this paper .",
    "actually , if the neutrino mechanism plays a key role for producing the jet , the jet power also depends on the mass of the black hole .",
    "in addition , the dependency on the mass accretion rate would be different ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the propagations of accretion - powered jets in various types of massive stars such as wolf - rayet stars , light population iii ( pop iii ) stars , and massive pop iii stars , all of which are the progenitor candidates of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we perform two dimensional axisymmetric simulations of relativistic hydrodynamics taking into account both the envelope collapse and the jet propagation ( i.e. , the negative feedback of the jet on the accretion ) . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the accretion rate from the mass flux going through the inner boundary , and inject the jet with a constant accretion - to - jet conversion efficiency @xmath0 . by varying the efficiency @xmath0 and opening angle @xmath1 for more than @xmath2 models </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the forward shock wave succeeds to break out of the stellar surface and potentially create grbs in all types of progenitors if a simple condition @xmath3 is satisfied , that is consistent with analytical estimates , otherwise no explosion or some failed spherical explosions occur . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest that a ( slightly ) delayed jet injection is preferred for grbs . </S>"
