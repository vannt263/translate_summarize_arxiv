    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : pint_pext ] that there is a good correlation between the internal and external pressures of gmcs , suggesting that the variation in gmc mass surface densities that we observe between m51 , m33 and the lmc may arise because the external ism pressure plays a role in regulating the internal pressure ( and hence velocity dispersion and density ) of molecular clouds .",

    "although their interpretation remains controversial , these scaling relations are regularly used to compare the physical properties of molecular clouds in different galactic environments .",
    "a key result of our analysis is that these scaling relations  as obtained from co surveys of extragalactic gmc populations  are highly dependent on observational effects , such as instrumental resolution and sensitivity , and on the techniques of gmc identification and property measurement that are commonly applied to co spectral line cubes . in this section , we discuss some caveats regarding the physical significance of the empirical relations observed for extragalactic gmcs , and whether they are sufficient to demonstrate the universality of gmc properties .",
    "+      larson s third `` law '' describes an inverse relationship between the density of a molecular cloud and its size , implying that molecular clouds have roughly constant molecular gas column density .",
    "several studies of extragalactic gmc populations via their co emission ( e.g. b08 ) have reported that the average  surface density of extragalactic gmcs is roughly constant within galaxies and , moreover , that it is in good agreement with the value that is observed for gmcs in the inner milky way , @xmath34 .",
    "our results in section  [ sect : llaws ] , by contrast , suggest that there are subtle but genuine variations in the characteristic  surface density for the gmc populations of m51 , m33 and the lmc . + as noted by several previous authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the limited surface brightness sensitivity of extragalactic co observations is an evident source of bias for co - based estimates of gmc mass surface density , since sightlines with low to intermediate  column densities will fall beneath the co detection limit and hence be excluded from the regions that are identified as molecular . at high brightness , on the other hand , co observations may underestimate the true  column density if the co - emitting regions within shadow each other in velocity space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "coupled with the fact that widefield extragalactic  observations are rarely designed to achieve surface brightness sensitivities much deeper than @xmath35 for a typical @xmath36  cloud , these effects suggest that the range of  column densities inferred from co observations will inevitably be quite restricted . indeed , even though the minimum co - derived estimate of @xmath37 for the paws gmcs still likely reflects the survey s limiting co surface brightness sensitivity ( see figure  [ fig : rl ] ) , the large velocity dispersion of the co - emitting gas within the paws field may explain why the dispersion of the size - co luminosity relation ( and hence the width of the inferred @xmath37 distribution ) is larger for m51 gmcs than for the gmc populations of m33 , the lmc and other local group systems ( cf figure  3 of b08 ) .",
    "+ some further insight is provided by comparing the size - luminosity relations obtained using different decompositions of the paws data cube in figure  [ fig : rl ] . in particular , it is evident that the co surface brightness values obtained using a method that preferentially identifies structures with a characteristic size scale ( i.e. the `` cloud - based '' decompositions in figure  [ fig : rl][a ] and  [ b ] ) cover a wider range than the values obtained when the boundaries of the identified structures are defined using a fixed intensity threshold ( i.e. the `` island - based '' decompositions in figure  [ fig : rl][c ] and  [ d ] ) .",
    "quantitatively , we find that the scatter in the logarithm of the residuals about the best - fitting size - luminosity relationships increases from @xmath38dex for islands in both the intrinsic and matched resolution m51 datacubes to @xmath5dex for the cloud structures identified in the same cubes . + these decomposition - dependent results for the scatter in the co surface brightness ( and hence @xmath39 ) values derived from the paws data are qualitatively similar to the two cases considered by @xcite in their analysis of nearby galactic clouds using dust extinction to trace  column density : the average co surface brightness of molecular structures above a fixed brightness threshold is approximately constant , while equivalent measurements over a fixed size scale yield much larger variations in @xmath39 , both between and within the gmc populations of the three galaxies that we investigate .",
    "@xcite argue that the former result arises because molecular clouds have an approximately universal log - normal column density distribution .",
    "while this hypothesis can be empirically verified using extinction data for local clouds , the resolution and dynamic range of the extragalactic co data is insufficient to recover the detailed shape of the  distribution for individual extragalactic gmcs . in our case ,",
    "the narrow range of co surface brightness measurements in figure  [ fig : rl][c ] and  [ d ] arises because a large fraction of the pixels within an island structure sample emission that is close to the observational sensitivity limit . for the intrinsic resolution m51 cube",
    ", we find that for over half the islands ( 51% ) , pixels with integrated intensity values less than 5@xmath26 make up more than half the total number of pixels within the structure .",
    "this fraction ( i.e. where pixels with values @xmath40 consitute the majority of pixels within the structure ) is similar in the lmc ( 46% of islands ) and even greater in m33 ( 78% of islands ) .",
    "+ our conclusion is that the appearance of constant co surface brightness among extragalactic gmcs is mostly an artifact due to the combination of several conspiring effects : first , the algebraically - imposed covariance of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which yields a robust yet trivial correlation between these quantities ; second , the strategy of designing extragalactic co surveys to detect a ` typical ' milky way gmc at the @xmath43 level , which limits a survey s co surface brightness sensitivity and may only reveal the high - mass , co - bright gmcs in low - mass galaxies ( rather than the bulk of the molecular cloud population ) ; and third , the limited range of environmental conditions that had been probed by extragalactic co observations with cloud - scale resolution prior to paws .",
    "+      the possibility that the size - linewidth relation is an observational artifact has received less attention in the literature , with most debate focussing on whether it is a sign that gmcs attain approximate virial balance between their gravitational and internal kinetic energies , or a manifestation of interstellar turbulence ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis ( see figure  [ fig : rdv ] ) suggests that some caution interpreting the extragalactic gmc results is required .",
    "in particular , we find little evidence for a correlation between the size and linewidth of cloud structures _ within _",
    "m51 , m33 or the lmc . a combined sample of gmcs from all three galaxies , on the other hand , yields a size - linewidth relation similar to @xmath44 simply due to the variations in spectral and spatial resolution of the input datasets . for reasons noted in section  [",
    "sect : gmcproperties ] , decomposition algorithms preferentially identify structures in position and velocity space close to the resolution of a data cube . based on our analysis of the m51 , m33 and lmc data",
    ", we would therefore recommend that if measurements from high resolution datasets yield the clouds with small radii and narrow linewidths , and low resolution datasets populate the large @xmath42 and high @xmath45 end of a size - linewidth relation , then this bias should be explicitly excluded before a physical explanation for the correlation is invoked .",
    "+ while cloud structures identified in the matched resolution data cubes of all three galaxies fail to exhibit a strong correlation between their size and linewidth , the vertical offset between the cloud populations in m51 and the low - mass galaxies in figure  [ fig : rdv][b ] suggests there may be a genuine difference in the physical state of their cloud populations . more precisely , clouds in m51  and especially in the spiral arms and central regions  have larger linewidths compared to clouds of an equivalent size in the lmc or m33 .",
    "since regions with high velocity dispersion in m51 s inner disk are often associated with low levels of star formation activity @xcite and the star formation rates of m33 and the lmc are high relative to their global co luminosities ( assuming a universal molecular gas depletion time of @xmath46gyr , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it seems unlikely that this segregation is due to higher levels of internal turbulence generated by star formation feedback . on the other hand",
    ", such an offset would be expected if the dynamical state of the clouds is influenced by the external pressure , as we suggested in section  [ sect : prev_results ] . following ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( see also @xcite and @xcite for alternative derivations ) , clouds that achieve equilibrium between self - gravity , the external pressure and their internal kinetic energy should follow : @xmath47 according to our estimates in section  [ sect : prev_results ] , the external pressure experienced by clouds in m51 is approximately an order of magnitude higher than for clouds in m33 and the lmc . from equation  [ eqn : rdv_pressure ]",
    ", we would then expect m51 clouds to exhibit linewidths @xmath48 times larger than clouds of similar size in the low - mass galaxies , in good agreement with the vertical offset in the size - linewidth plot that we observe ( a factor of @xmath46 at a fixed size scale ) .",
    "+ a second important result from our analysis in section  [ sect : llaws ] is that a tighter correlation between the size and linewidth of molecular structures becomes apparent when we identify gmcs as regions of connected co emission ( i.e. islands ) .",
    "arguably the most convincing example is for islands identified in the lmc data cube with its intrinsic resolution ( figure  [ fig : rdv][c ] ) , which follow @xmath49 over @xmath46 orders of magnitude in size . in the intrinsic resolution",
    "cube , island structures in the spiral arms and central region of m51 exhibit a weak correlation that is shallower than for lmc islands : @xmath50 . on one hand , this could indicate a genuine difference in the density structure of the molecular ism between the two environments .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite show that if the size - linewidth relation arises due to gas clumps being brought together at the location of a shock ( e.g a spiral shock , or the interface of two colliding flows ) , then a steeper size - linewidth relation is expected if molecular gas is more clumpy .",
    "the higher peak brightness of the co emission in m51 suggests that co - emitting regions may fill the beam more uniformly in m51 than in the lmc , which is at least qualitatively consistent with the lmc hosting more clumpy molecular material than m51 , but higher resolution observations that probe the internal density structure of gmcs in the lmc and m51 would be required to validate this model . on the other hand",
    ", we caution that the shallower correlation for islands in m51 s spiral arms may be partly driven by the @xmath51 objects with @xmath52pc .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : rdv][c ] suggests that these objects appear to follow a shallower relationship than the scattered trend exhibited by the smaller islands . excluding islands with @xmath53pc from the fit yields @xmath54 for the m51 arm+central region , which has a slope that is more similar to the lmc relation . +",
    "the possibility that the gmc linewidths that we measure include gas motions unrelated to the cloud s intrinsic velocity dispersion is underscored by the fact that structures with @xmath55pc ( the magenta squares in figure  [ fig : rdv][c ] and  [ d ] ) also seem to follow a relation that is roughly consistent with the canonical size - linewidth relationship derived for galactic gmcs by s87 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising if the origin of the size - linewidth relation is due to gmcs achieving dynamical equilibrium or turbulence in the molecular ism , since we would expect the size - linewidth relationship to break down on scales corresponding to the largest virialized structures or the spatial scale on which the turbulence is driven , usually thought to be comparable to the scale height of the gas disk ( @xmath56pc in m51 ) . for structures on scales much larger than a typical gmc , the linewidths that we measure are likely to be broadened by systematic motions within the galactic disk , such as galactic rotation or spiral arm streaming motions . to assess the importance of the former effect on the correlations in figure  [ fig : rdv][c ] and  [ d ] , we subtracted a model of the contribution of galactic rotation to the gmc linewidths from the m51 datacube . in practice , we did this by generating a map of the line - of - sight velocity that would be expected at each spatial position within the paws and magma fields from our preferred model of m51 s and lmc s rotation @xcite . after identifying islands of significant emission within the original data cubes",
    ", we used the miriad task specshift to offset the individual co spectra belonging to an island along the spectral axis such that the radial velocity corresponding to the model velocity field at each @xmath57 position was shifted to the central channel of a new ` velocity - shifted ' data cube .",
    "this is equivalent to subtracting the modeled rotation component from the observed velocity field map , although we manipulate the data in @xmath58 space so that the result is a datacube that can be analysed using cprops .",
    "next , we estimated the physical properties of each `` velocity - shifted '' island using the same method that we applied to the original data cubes ( see section  [ sect : cloudidentification ] ) .",
    "the aim of this shifting procedure was to suppress the contribution of galactic rotation to the global velocity dispersion measurement that we obtain for each island .",
    "+        in figure  [ fig : rdv_galsub ] , we plot the radius versus the velocity dispersion for the `` velocity - shifted '' islands ( red diamonds ) identified in m51 ( panel [ a ] ) and the lmc ( panel [ b ] ) . in both galaxies , there are fewer islands where cprops is able to measure the velocity dispersion after the shifting procedure . in m51 , many of these objects correspond to islands in the original sample with large velocity dispersions compared to their size , so the outliers and upper envelope of the main distribution of red diamonds in figure  [ fig : rdv ] are effectively removed .",
    "the result is to bring the bulk of the `` velocity - shifted '' m51 data points slightly closer to the measurements for the low - mass galaxies , and to the size - linewidth relation for inner milky way gmcs ( the dashed line in figure  [ fig : rdv_galsub ] ) .",
    "indeed , a bces bisector fit to the `` velocity - shifted '' m51 islands yields @xmath59 , which is indistinguishable from the canonical s87 result . in the lmc",
    ", the data points appear less scattered after the galactic rotation model is subtracted , but the overall distribution is not shifted towards significantly lower velocity dispersions , an effect that _ is _ seen for large ( @xmath60pc ) islands in m51 .",
    "the best - fitting size - linewidth relation for the velocity - shifted lmc islands is identical to the relation obtained from islands identified in the original data cube . in summary , we find that contamination of gmc linewidths by systematic motions associated with galactic rotation is significant for the largest co - emitting structures in m51 , but it does not appear to strongly determine the correlation between size and linewidth for structures with spatial scales corresponding to the characteristic size of gmcs ( i.e. 10 to 100pc ) .",
    "+ once again , our conclusion is that further investigation is required to establish whether extragalactic gmc populations follow the same size - linewidth relation as gmcs in the inner milky way , and that particular care must be taken to eliminate the effects of resolution , survey design  since the observing configuration of most extragalactic co surveys is selected to optimise sensitivity to structures with sizes and linewidths similar to galactic gmcs  and analysis methods .",
    "alternative explanations for the physical origin of the size - linewidth relation  besides simple virial equilibrium and interstellar turbulence  also merit further consideration .",
    "here we have suggested that the larger velocity dispersion of m51 clouds relative to clouds with similar size in the lmc and m33 may be due to the higher pressure at the cloud surface in m51 s inner disk .",
    "by contrast , the best explanation for the more robust size - linewidth relations that we recover when we identify gmcs as ` islands ' of co emission may be that an islands decomposition yields regions where external processes  such as a converging flow , or a spiral shock  are bringing pre - existing smaller molecular structures into the same spatial location .",
    "these ` cloud associations ' are likely to be globally unbound , with co linewidths that reflect the macroscopic motions of their constituent gas clumps , rather than interstellar turbulence _ per se _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", a scaling between the size and linewidth might simply reflect the inhomogeneous density distribution and velocity fluctuations in the neutral ism : over small scales , the constituent clumps encounter relatively homogenous material with similar density and local velocity resulting in a low clump - clump velocity dispersion . over larger scales , however , the clumps interact with material with a larger range of densities and peculiar velocities , and hence experience different decelerations .",
    "this produces a higher velocity dispersion between widely - separated clumps . in other words , the tighter correlation between size and linewidth when we identify gmcs as regions of connected co emission may simply reflect more adequate sampling of the density and velocity structure of the ism by the dense clumps that constitute the co islands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we compared the properties of gmcs identified in the paws survey of m51 s inner disk to the gmc populations of m33 and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "in contrast to previous comparative studies of extragalactic gmc populations , our datasets contain a statistically significant sample of clouds for each galaxy , have sufficient resolution to resolve individual gmcs and include single - dish measurements to recover total flux information .",
    "we explicitly homogenize the resolution , sensitivity and gridding scheme of the co datasets to suppress these important sources of bias on the derived gmc properties .",
    "our key results are : + 1 .",
    "we find genuine differences in the physical properties of gmcs in m51 , m33 and the lmc : on average , gmcs in m51 have higher peak co brightness , co surface brightness , and velocity dispersion than gmcs of equivalent size in the low - mass galaxies , consistent with the dynamical state of clouds being influenced by the ambient interstellar pressure .",
    "the observed differences are especially pronouced when we restrict our m51 gmc sample to objects in the spiral arm and central region . for this comparison , we took care to homogenize the co datasets and we note that this procedure was essential to minimize observational bias .",
    "the presence of a correlation between size and linewidth depends sensitively on how we define clouds .",
    "if we apply an aggressive decomposition algorithm to the co data cubes , we find no compelling evidence for a correlation between size and line width for the gmc populations of m51 , m33 or the lmc . a strong correlation similar to the canonical size - linewidth relationship for gmcs in the inner milky way is apparent when we identify gmcs as regions of contiguous co emission .",
    "we propose that these structures are more like cloud associations , i.e. regions where an external process has caused smaller pre - existing molecular gas structures to converge .",
    "in addition to simple virial equilibrium or a classical turbulent cascade , the observed size - linewidth relation may also be a reflection of more adequate sampling of the inhomeogeneous density and velocity structure of the interstellar medium by the clouds that belong to these associations .",
    "in general , more observational effort to identify the processes that contribute to the global linewidths of molecular clouds in different galactic environments would be highly desirable , and would significantly improve our understanding of the physical origin of the size - linewidth relation .",
    "+ 3 . within m51 , m33 and the lmc ,",
    "co islands exhibit a relatively narrow range of surface brightness measurements .",
    "we argue that the appearance of uniform surface brightness for these structures may be imposed by using a intensity threshold close to the survey s sensitivity limit to define the island boundary , since for many islands ( between 46 and 78% depending on the galaxy ) , the majority of pixels sample emission that is less than the 5@xmath26 sensitivity limit .",
    "the dynamic range of surface brightness measurements increases for a more aggressive cloud decomposition of the co datacubes , which tends to retain the high brightness substructure within the islands , and discard the low brightness emission surrounding the high intensity peaks .",
    "there appear to be genuine variations in the average surface brightness  and , we infer , average mass surface density  of the gmc populations in m51 , m33 and the lmc . combining our analysis with literature measurements of resolved extragalactic gmc properties",
    "suggests that the average gmc mass surface density varies with the characteristic interstellar pressure of the galactic environment where the gmcs are located .",
    "+ our results highlight the difficulties and limitations of decomposing molecular gas into clouds .",
    "this type of analysis becomes especially problematic for molecule - rich environments  like the inner disk of m51  where the emission is both bright and extended over spatial scales many times greater than the observational resolution . in light of the sensitive dependence of gmc property measurements and scaling relations on instrumental resolution , observational sensitivity and decomposition approach , methods that can analyse hierarchical structure ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would seem to offer a promising approach to studying the physical properties of the molecular ism , since they can quantify the importance of e.g. self - gravity or external pressure as a function of spatial scale without imposing a cloud - like model for the molecular gas _ a priori_. an analysis of the paws data using hierarchical decomposition methods will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( leroy et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "+ finally , we note that the tendency for molecular clouds in low - mass galaxies and the outer milky way to be smaller and fainter than molecular structures in the inner milky way  and , conversely , for gmcs in molecule - rich , high - pressure environments to be denser and more massive than local clouds  was already suggested by several previous observational studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . firmly establishing a dependence between gmc properties and galactic environment",
    "has proven difficult , however , in part because assembling large samples of extragalactic gmcs ( especially in co - faint dwarf galaxies ) remains technically challenging with the current generation of millimetre telescopes .",
    "future observations with alma that efficiently survey the co emission across a significant fraction of nearby galactic disks will be invaluable for increasing the number of extragalactic gmc samples and the range of environments where gmc properties can be studied .",
    "such observations will be crucial for establishing the physical mechanisms that are responsible for variations in gmc properties and regulate their ability to form stars .",
