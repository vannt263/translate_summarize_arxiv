    "understanding the structural and thermal properties of two dimensional ( 2d ) systems is of great interest in many fields including mechanics , statistical physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "traditionally , it was discussed mainly in the context of biological membranes and soft condensed matter .",
    "the complexity of these systems hindered any truly microscopic approach based on a realistic description of interatomic interactions .",
    "phenomenological theories of membranes@xcite based on elasticity@xcite reveal nontrivial scaling behavior of physical properties , like in- and out - of - plane atomic displacements . in three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems , this type of behavior takes place only close to critical points@xcite , whereas in 2d this occurs at any finite temperature .",
    "the discovery of graphene  @xcite , the first truly 2d crystal made of just one layer of carbon atoms , provides a model system for which an atomistic description becomes possible .",
    "the interest for graphene has been triggered by its exceptional electronic properties ( for review see  @xcite ) but the experimental observation of ripples in freely suspended graphene  @xcite has initiated a theoretical interest also in the structural properties  @xcite .",
    "ripples or bending fluctuations have been proposed as one of the dominant scattering mechanisms that determine the electron mobility in graphene  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , the structural state influences the mechanical properties that are important for numerous potential applications of graphene  @xcite .",
    "graphene is a crystalline membrane , with finite resistance to in plane shear deformations , contrary to liquid membranes as soap films .",
    "moreover , for graphene , this resistance is extremely high since the carbon - carbon bond is one of the strongest chemical bonds in nature .",
    "the young modulus per layer of graphene is 350 n / m , an order of magnitude larger than that of steel@xcite .",
    "phenomenological theories just assume that the membrane thickness is negligible in comparison to the lateral dimensions . once a microscopic treatment is allowed , one can also distinguish between , e.g. , single layers and bilayers@xcite .",
    "the aim of this review is to summarize the contribution of microscopic treatments of graphene as the simplest ( prototype ) membrane to our general understanding of 2d systems . to this purpose",
    "we first review the main results of phenomenological theories , particularly those that can be directly compared to results of atomistic approaches .",
    "the standard theory of lattice dynamics is based on the harmonic approximation assuming atomic displacements from equilibrium to be much smaller than the interatomic distance @xmath0 . for 3d crystals ,",
    "this assumption holds up to melting according to the empirical lindemann criterion . for 2d crystals the situation is so different that landau and peierls suggested in the 1930 s that 2d crystals can not exist .",
    "later , their qualitative arguments were made more rigorous in the context of the so - called mermin - wagner theorem ( see references in @xcite .",
    "since graphene is generally considered to be a 2d _ crystal _ this point needs to be clarified first .      by aauming that atomic displacements @xmath1 satisfy the condition @xmath2 where @xmath3 labels the elementary cell and @xmath4 the atoms within the elementary cell",
    ", we can expand the potential energy @xmath5 up to quadratic terms ( harmonic approximation ) : @xmath6 where the matrix @xmath7 is the force constant matrix , @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the vectors of the 2d bravais lattice and @xmath11 are basis vectors .",
    "lattice vibrations are then described as superposition of independent modes , called phonons , characterized by wavevector @xmath12 and branch number @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of atoms per unit cell .",
    "the squared phonon frequencies @xmath15 are the eigenvalues of the @xmath16 dynamical matrix @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of atom @xmath4 . for graphene , @xmath19 is the mass of the carbon atom and by symmetry @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "translational invariance requires that no forces result from a rigid shift of the crystal , implying : @xmath22 whence @xmath23    therefore , there are six phonon branches in graphene :    * the acoustic flexural mode za @xmath24 @xmath25 * the optical flexural mode zo @xmath24 @xmath26 * two acoustic in - plane modes , with @xmath27 equal to the eigenvalues of the @xmath28 matrix @xmath29 * two optical in - plane modes , with @xmath27 equal to eigenvalues of the @xmath28 matrix @xmath30    if the 2d wavevector @xmath12 lies in symmetric directions , branches ( 3)-(6 ) can be divided into longitudinal @xmath31 and transverse @xmath32 modes . due to [ cond ] for acoustic modes",
    "@xmath33 at @xmath34 . for the za mode",
    ", however , the terms in @xmath35 disappear as well and @xmath36@xcite .",
    "this follows from the invariance with respect to _ rotations _ of a 2d crystal as a whole in the 3d space , namely for uniform rotations of the type @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the rotation angle and @xmath39 the rotation axis in the @xmath40-plane .",
    "these rotations should not lead to any forces or torques acting on the atoms .",
    "hence , @xmath41 it follows from [ rot_inv ] , [ dyn_mat ] that @xmath42_{\\vec{q}=0 } = 0\\ ] ] and , thus , the expansion of [ za ] starts with terms of the order of @xmath43 ; therefore , @xmath44 at @xmath34 .",
    "the very low frequency of @xmath45 for @xmath34 has important consequences for the stability and thermal properties as we discuss next . in [ phononspectrum ]",
    "we show the phonon spectrum@xcite calculated with the so - called long - range carbon bond order potential ( lcbopii)@xcite used in the atomistic simulations presented later .    .",
    "[ phononspectrum ]    let us consider now the case of finite temperatures . in the harmonic approximation ,",
    "the mean - square atomic displacement is @xmath46 where @xmath47 are phonon labels , @xmath48 is the polarization vector and @xmath49 is the number of elementary cells . for in - plane deformations at any finite temperature the sum in [ uu ] is logarithmically divergent due to the contribution of acoustic branches with @xmath50 for @xmath34 .",
    "this divergence is cut at the minimal wavevector @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the sample size ) , thus @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the average sound velocity .",
    "this result led landau and peierls to the conclusion that 2d crystals can not exist .",
    "strictly speaking , this means just the inapplicability of the harmonic approximation , due to violation of [ smallness ] . a more rigorous treatment , however , does confirm this conclusion ( see @xcite ) . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the situation is even worse , due to the much stronger divergence of za phonons ( [ za ] ) .",
    "one can see from [ uu ] that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is of the order of the cohesive energy .",
    "henceforth we use the notation @xmath58 , and denote @xmath59 as a 2d vector .",
    "we have shown that the harmonic approximation can not be applied at any finite temperature to 2d crystals neither for in - plane nor for out - of - plane modes since the condition [ smallness ] is violated due to divergent contributions of acoustic long - wavelengths modes with @xmath60 .",
    "in this situation , it becomes necessary to consider anharmonic interactions between in - plane and out - of - plane modes . in the limit @xmath60",
    ", acoustic modes can be described by elasticity@xcite .",
    "the corresponding effective hamiltonian @xmath61 reads @xmath62 where the deformation tensor @xmath63 is @xmath64 @xmath65 is the bending rigidity and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are lam coefficients . in the deformation tensor , we have kept the nonlinear terms in @xmath68 but not @xmath69 since out - of - plane fluctuations are stronger than in - plane ones ( compare [ x2 ] and [ h2 ] ) .",
    "if we neglect all nonlinear terms in the deformation tensor , then @xmath61 in @xmath12 representation becomes : @xmath70\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath71 indicates the harmonic approximation and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are fourier components of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , with @xmath76 .",
    "the correlation functions in harmonic approximation are @xmath77    @xmath78 \\frac{1 } { \\mu q^4 } \\label{d0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 means averaging with the hamiltonian @xmath80 ( [ eq : free_f_0 ] ) .    for a surface @xmath81 the components of the normal are @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a 2d gradient . if @xmath84 , the normal - normal correlation function is related to @xmath85 @xmath86 on substituting [ g0 ] into [ nn ] we find @xmath87 a membrane is globally flat if the correlation function @xmath88 tends to a constant as @xmath89 ( normals at large distances have , on average , the same direction ) .",
    "[ nnt ] , instead , leads to a logarithmic divergence of @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the mean square in - plane and out - of - plane displacements calculated from [ g0 ] and [ d0 ] are divergent as @xmath91 as already shown .",
    "again , we conclude that the statistical mechanics of 2d systems can not be based on the harmonic approximation .",
    "taking into account the coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath92 due to the nonlinear terms in the deformation tensor [ strain ] drastically changes this situation .",
    "we can introduce the renormalized bending rigidity @xmath93 by writing @xmath94 the first - order anharmonic correction to @xmath65 is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the 2d young modulus@xcite . at @xmath97 the correction @xmath98 , and the coupling between in - plane and out - of - plane distortions can not be considered as a perturbation .",
    "the value @xmath99 plays the same role as the ginzburg criterion@xcite in the theory of critical phenomena : below @xmath99 interactions between fluctuations dominate .",
    "note that in the theory of _ liquid _ membranes , there is also a divergent anharmonic correction to @xmath65 of completely different origin@xcite @xmath100 this term has sign opposite to the one of a crystalline membrane , [ delta ] , and is much smaller than the latter .    in presence of strongly interacting long - wavelength fluctuations , scaling considerations are extremely useful@xcite .",
    "let us assume that the behavior of the renormalized bending rigidity @xmath93 at small @xmath101 is determined by some exponent @xmath102 , @xmath103 yielding @xmath104 where the parameter @xmath105 of the order of @xmath106 is introduced to make @xmath107 dimensionless .",
    "one can assume also a renormalization of the effective lam coefficients @xmath108 , @xmath109",
    "@xmath110 which means @xmath111 finally , we assume that anharmonicities change [ h2 ] into @xmath112 the values @xmath102,@xmath113 and @xmath114 are similar to critical exponents in the theory of critical phenomena .",
    "they are not independent@xcite @xmath115 the exponent @xmath113 is positive if @xmath116 .",
    "the so - called self - consistent - screening - approximation@xcite gives @xmath117 whereas a more accurate renormalization group approach@xcite yields @xmath118 .",
    "this means that , interactions make out - of - plane phonons harder and in - plane phonons softer .",
    "the temperature dependence of the constant @xmath107 in [ g ] can be found from the assumption that [ g0 ] and [ gq ] should match at @xmath119 , giving @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a dimensionless factor of the order of one .",
    "now we are ready to discuss the possibility of long - range crystal order in 2d systems at finite temperatures .",
    "the true manifestation of long - range order is the existence of delta - function ( bragg ) peaks in diffraction experiments .",
    "the scattering intensity is proportional to the structure factor @xmath122 \\right > \\label{s}\\ ] ] that can be rewritten as @xmath123 \\sum_{jj ' } \\exp\\left [ i \\vec{q } \\left(\\vec{\\rho}_{j}- \\vec{\\rho}_{j ' } \\right ) \\right ]   w_{nj , n'j ' } \\label{s1}\\ ] ] where @xmath124\\right>\\ ] ] in 3d crystals , one can assume that the displacements @xmath125 and @xmath126 are not correlated for @xmath127 so that @xmath128 where @xmath129 are debye - waller factors that are independent of @xmath3 due to translational invariance . therefore , for @xmath130 ( reciprocal lattice vectors ) , where @xmath131 , the contribution to @xmath132 is proportional to @xmath133 , whereas for a generic @xmath12 it is of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "the bragg peaks at @xmath130 are , therefore , sharp ; thermal fluctuations decrease their intensity ( by the debye - waller factor ) but do not broaden the peaks .",
    "the observation of such peaks is an experimental manifestation of long - range crystal order . in 2d",
    "the correlation functions of atomic displacements do not vanish as @xmath134 .",
    "indeed , in the continuum limit , @xmath135 and we have @xmath136 ^ 2\\right > = 2 \\sum_{\\vec{q } } \\left < |h(\\vec{q}|^2\\right > \\left [ 1-\\cos \\left(\\vec{q } \\left ( \\vec{r}- \\vec{r}'\\right ) \\right ) \\right ]",

    "\\sim |\\vec{r}- \\vec{r}'|^{\\eta_u}\\ ] ] after substitutions of [ gq],[etau]@xcite .",
    "thus the approximation [ w ] does not apply . as a result ,",
    "the sum over @xmath138 at a given @xmath3 is convergent , and @xmath139 ; instead of a delta - function bragg peak we have a sharp maximum of finite width .",
    "this means that , rigorously speaking , the statement that 2d crystals can not exist at finite temperatures is correct .",
    "however , the structure factor of graphene still has sharp maxima at @xmath130 and the crystal lattice can be determined from the positions of these maxima . in this restricted sense ,",
    "2d crystals do exist , and graphene is a prototype example of them .",
    "it was found experimentally by transmission electron microscopy , that freely suspended graphene at room temperature is rippled@xcite .",
    "the existence of these thermally induced ripples motivated our atomistic monte carlo simulations@xcite summarized in the next section .",
    "as discussed before the thermal properties of 2d crystals are determined by longwavelength fluctuations .",
    "therefore , one needs to deal with large enough systems to probe the interesting regime of strongly interacting fluctuations .",
    "this requirement rules out , in practice , first principle approaches in favor of accurate empirical potentials .",
    "the unusual structural aspects of graphene , make it desirable to describe different structural and bonding configurations , beyond the harmonic approximation , by means of a unique interatomic potential .",
    "bond order potentials are a class of empirical interatomic potentials designed for this purpose ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they aim at describing also anharmonic effects and the possible breaking and formation of bonds in structural phase transitions .",
    "they allow to study without further adjustment of parameters , all carbon structures , including the effect of defects , edges and other structural changes , also as a function of temperature as well as phonon spectra .",
    "we have used the so - called long - range carbon bond order potential lcbopii@xcite .",
    "its main innovative feature is the treatment of interplanar van der waals interactions , that allows to deal with graphitic structures . to calculate equilibrium properties as a function of temperature",
    ", we have performed monte carlo simulations either at constant volume or constant pressure .",
    "we first discuss the results for correlations functions that can be directly compared to the scaling behavior discussed previously .",
    "then , we report the temperature dependence of several structural properties of graphene .",
    "lastly we discuss the melting of graphene in relation to its 3d counterpart , graphite , and to 2d models of melting .      we compare the results of atomistic monte carlo simulations to the scaling behavior of @xmath140 ( [ gq ] ) . from [ gq ] , one can see that @xmath140 can be calculated in two ways , either by calculating directly the correlator of @xmath74 or of the normal @xmath141 . in doing this , it is important to have @xmath74 and @xmath141 calculated at lattice sites smoothened by averaging over the neighbors , as described in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "only by such a procedure one verifies numerically [ nn ] for@xmath142 nm@xmath143 which gives the limit of applicability of a continuum description to graphene .",
    "the interesting regime is @xmath144 ( [ q * ] ) .",
    "for graphene at room temperature @xmath145 nm@xmath143 .",
    "since simulations are done for samples of dimension @xmath146 with periodic boundary conditions , the smallest values of @xmath101 that can be reached are @xmath147 and @xmath148 . for the largest samples",
    ", we have found that straightforward monte carlo simulations based on individual atomic moves , could not provide enough sampling for the smallest wavevectors .",
    "for this reason in our first paper on ripples in graphene@xcite we were not able to check the scaling laws in the anharmonic regime .",
    "later , we have reached this regime by devising a numerical technique that we have called wave moves , where collective sinusoidal long wavelengths displacements of all atoms where added in the monte carlo equilibration procedure@xcite .     for three samples with indicated number of atoms @xmath149 . for the largest , @xmath150 , @xmath151  , @xmath152  . adapted from ref.@xcite ]    in [ fig : gq ] we present @xmath153 calculated with wave moves which displays a clear change of the slope @xmath154 versus @xmath155 around @xmath156 .",
    "notice that @xmath157 grows for @xmath158 nm@xmath143 reaching a maximum at the first bragg peak . according to the phenomenological theory described before ,",
    "the change of scaling behaviour at @xmath144 is related to the coupling of in - plane and out - of plane fluctuations . to check this",
    ", we also show in [ fig : gamma ] the correlation function @xmath159 @xmath160 which becomes almost zero at @xmath161 . for smaller samples",
    "the coupling is reduced as expected for a property that is determined by the region of long wavelengths fluctuations .     for three values of @xmath149 ]    the temperature dependence of the bending rigidity @xmath163 can be extracted from the @xmath164 using [ nnt ] .",
    "the results@xcite are shown in [ fig : kt ] where one can see the rapid growth with temperature .",
    "this effect should not be confused with the correction @xmath165 of [ delta ] since the latter is strongly @xmath101-dependent .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath65 of [ fig : kt ] can not be described within the self - consistent screening approximation for our model hamiltonian [ eq : free_f_1]@xcite .     as found by fitting @xmath164 to [ gq ] .",
    "adapted from ref.@xcite ]    the temperature dependence of @xmath65 , as that of all parameters of phonon spectra@xcite , is an anharmonic effect that goes beyond the model [ eq : free_f_1 ] , namely it does not result from the coupling of acoustic out - of plane phonons with acoustic in - plane phonons only .",
    "other anharmonicities , like coupling to other phonons have to be invoked .",
    "this is an example of effects that can be studied within atomistic simulations but not within the elasticity theory .",
    "the potential energy given by lcbopii includes by construction anharmonic effects .",
    "purely anharmonic effects are the temperature dependence of lattice parameter and elastic moduli .",
    "the temperature dependence@xcite of the lattice parameter @xmath166 is shown in [ fig : a_t ] and those of the shear modulus @xmath66 and adiabatic bulk modulus @xmath167 in [ fig : ba - mu_t ] .",
    "the most noticeable feature in [ fig : a_t ] is the change of sign of @xmath168 , namely a change from thermal contraction to thermal expansion around 1000 k.     calculated by monte carlo simulations at zero pressure . adapted from ref.@xcite , title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : a_t ]     and shear modulus @xmath66 .",
    "adapted from ref.@xcite ]    usually thermal expansion is described in the quasiharmonic approximation@xcite where the free energy is written as in the harmonic approximation but with volume dependent phonon frequencies @xmath169 .",
    "this dependence is described by the grneisen parameters @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the volume ( the area for 2d systems ) . in most solids , phonon frequencies",
    "grow under compression , which corresponds to positive grneisen parameters and thermal expansion .",
    "graphene and graphite are however exceptional , as illustrated in [ fig : grungraphene ] presenting the corresponding calculation with lcbopii@xcite .",
    "one can see that both the @xmath172 and @xmath173 branches have @xmath174 almost in the whole brillouin zone as found already , within density functional calculations@xcite .",

    "courtesy of l.j .",
    "karssemeijer , title=\"fig : \" ]    experimentally , graphite has a negative thermal expansion coefficient up to 700k @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been explained in the quasiharmonic approximation in ref.@xcite .",
    "for graphene , they predicted negative @xmath168 at all temperatures .",
    "negative thermal expansion of graphene at room temperature has been confirmed experimentally@xcite .",
    "the linear thermal expansion coefficient was about -10@xmath176 k@xmath143 , a very large negative value . according to the quasiharmonic theory ,",
    "it was found to be more or less constant up to temperatures of the order of at least 2000 k , in contrast to the atomistic simulations of [ fig : a_t ] .",
    "thus the change of sign of @xmath168 should be attributed to self - anharmonic effects@xcite , namely to direct effects of phonon - phonon interactions .",
    "very recently , it was confirmed experimentally that @xmath168 , while remaining negative , decreases in modulus with increasing temperature up to 400k@xcite , which can be considered as a partial confirmation of our prediction .",
    "also the temperature dependence of the shear modulus @xmath66 , shown in [ fig : ba - mu_t ] is anomalous since typically @xmath177 at any temperature .",
    "the change of sign of @xmath177 occurs roughly at the same temperature of @xmath168 .",
    "the room - temperature values of the elastic constants are @xmath178 ev / @xmath179 and @xmath180 ev / @xmath179 . the corresponding young modulus @xmath181 lies within the error bars of the experimental value@xcite @xmath182 nm@xmath143 .",
    "the poisson ratio @xmath183 is found to be very small , of the order of @xmath184 .",
    "melting in 2d is usually described in terms of creation of topological defects , like unbound disclinations that destroy orientational order and unbound dislocations that destroy translational order@xcite . in the hexagonal lattice of graphene ,",
    "typical disclinations are pentagons ( 5 ) and heptagons ( 7 ) while dislocations are 5 - 7 pairs .",
    "our atomistic simulations@xcite have given an unexpected scenario of the melting of graphene as the decomposition of the 2d crystal in a 3d network of 1d chains .",
    "a crucial role in the melting process is played by the stone - wales ( sw ) defects , non - topological defects with a 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 configuration .",
    "the sw defects have the smallest formation energy and start appearing spontaneously at about 4200 k. it is the clustering of sw defects that triggers the spontaneous melting around 4900 k in our simulations .",
    "k. adapted from ref.@xcite ]    in [ fig : meltingstructure ] we show a typical configuration of graphene on the way to melting at 5000 k. the coexistence of crystalline and molten regions indicates a first order phase transition .",
    "the most noticeable features are the puddles of graphene that have molten into chains .",
    "the molten areas are surrounded by disordered 5 - 7 clusters , resulting from the clustering and distortion of sw defects .",
    "isolated and pairs of sw defects are also present whereas we never observe isolated pentagons , heptagons or 5 - 7 dislocations .",
    "contrary to graphite where melting is initiated by interplanar covalent bond formation , in graphene it seems that 5 - 7 clusters act as nuclei for the melting . by close inspection",
    ", we find that regions with 5 - 7 clusters favor the transformation of three hexagons into two pentagons and one octagon that we never see occurring in the regular hexagonal lattice far from the 5 - 7 clusters .",
    "the large bonding angle in octagons , in turn , leads to the proliferation of larger rings . due to the weakening of the bonds with small angles in the pentagons around them , these larger rings tend to detach from the lattice and form chains .",
    "when melting is completed the carbon chains form an entangled 3d network with a substantial amount of three - fold coordinated atoms , linking the chains .",
    "the molten phase is similar to the one found for fullerenes and nanotubes(see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the structure of the high temperature phase reminds rather a polymer gel than a simple liquid , a quite amazing fact for an elemental substance .    the closest system to graphene is graphite .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath185 of graphite has been extensively studied experimentally at pressures around @xmath186 gpa and the results present a large spread between @xmath187 k and @xmath188 k @xcite . with lcbopii , free energy calculations give @xmath189 k , almost independent of pressure between @xmath190 and @xmath191 gpa ( see references in @xcite . at zero pressure , however , graphite sublimates before melting at @xmath192 k @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations with lcbopii at zero pressure show that , at @xmath192 k , graphite sublimates through detachment of the graphene layers . the melting of graphene in vacuum that we have studied here can be thought of as the last step in the thermal decomposition of graphite .",
    "interestingly , formation of carbon chains has been observed in the melt zone of graphite under laser irradiation@xcite .",
    "although the temperature @xmath193  k of spontaneous melting represents an upper limit for @xmath185 , our simulations suggest that @xmath185 of graphene at zero pressure is higher than that of graphite .",
    "we have shown by comparing the results of atomistic simulations to the theory of membranes based on a continuum approach , that graphene can indeed be considered a prototype of 2d membrane and that atomistic studies can be used to evaluate accurately the scaling properties , including scaling exponents and cross - over behavior .",
    "conversely , the melting of graphene is determined rather by the peculiarities of the carbon - carbon bond and the high stability of carbon chains than as a generic model for melting in 2d .",

    "<S> the understanding of the structural and thermal properties of membranes , low - dimensional flexible systems in a space of higher dimension , is pursued in many fields from string theory to chemistry and biology . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a two dimensional ( 2d ) membrane in three dimensions is the relevant one for dealing with real materials . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , membranes are primarily discussed in the context of biological membranes and soft matter in general . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of these systems hindered a realistic description of their interatomic structures based on a truly microscopic approach . </S>",
    "<S> therefore theories of membranes were developed mostly within phenomenological models . from the point of view of statistical mechanics , membranes at finite temperature are systems governed by interacting long - range fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene , the first truly two - dimensional system consisting of just one layer of carbon atoms , provides a model system for the development of a microscopic description of membranes . in the same way that geneticists have used drosophila as a gateway to probe more complex questions , theoretical chemists and physicists </S>",
    "<S> can use graphene as a simple model membrane to study both phenomenological theories and experiments . in this account , we review key results in the microscopic theory of structural and thermal properties of graphene and compare them with the predictions of phenomenological theories . </S>",
    "<S> the two approaches are in good agreement for the various scaling properties of correlation functions of atomic displacements . </S>",
    "<S> however , some other properties , such as the temperature dependence of the bending rigidity , can not be understood based on phenomenological approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider graphene at very high temperature and compare the results with existing models for two - dimensional melting . </S>",
    "<S> the melting of graphene presents a different scenario , and we describe that process as the decomposition of the graphene layer into entangled carbon chains . </S>"
