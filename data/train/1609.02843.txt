    "to investigate the effects of extrinsic carriers on thermal plasmons , we consider the fermi golden rule for the rate of change of the plasmon distribution function @xcite :    @xmath99 \\delta(\\epsilon_{m{\\bf k } } + \\hbar\\omega_{\\rm p}({\\bf q } ) - \\epsilon_{n{\\bf k+q } } )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 are plasmon energies , @xmath100 electron - plasmon coupling coefficients , and @xmath0/@xmath101 are bose / fermi occupation factors for plasmons / electrons . in practice , the first term accounts for the increase of the plasmon population induced by the absorption of an electron - hole pair , whereas the inverse process is described by the second term .",

    "on the other hand , the plasmon intensity is reduced as a consequence of the lifetime effects introduced by landau damping , and its intensity becomes essentially indistinguishable from the spectral signatures of electron - hole pairs .",
    "we now evaluate the impact of electron - plasmon scattering processes on the carrier mobility in silicon . in the relaxation - time approximation",
    "the mobility is given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the conductivity effective mass , that is the harmonic average of the longitudinal and transverse masses , and @xmath112 is the scattering time arising from processes involving plasmons ( ep ) , phonons ( ep ) , electron - hole pairs ( eh ) , and impurities ( i ) . noting that scattering time and relaxation time differ by less that 10% at low carrier concentrations @xcite , we follow matthiessen s rule to calculate @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 are the electron self - energies associated with each interaction .    strictly speaking the mobility",
    "@xmath70 is an average property of all the carriers in a semiconductor ; however , for illustration purposes , it is useful to consider a ` single - electron ' mobility obtained as @xmath117 .",
    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a . in this figure",
    "we see that the mobility decreases as one moves higher up in the conduction band ; this behavior relates to the increased phase - space availability for electronic transitions .",
    "in addition we see that the mobility decreases with increasing carrier concentration . in order to analyse this trend",
    "we give a breakdown of the various sources of scattering in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , and we compare our calculations to experiment . here",
    "we show the carrier mobility at 300  k averaged on the fermi surface defined by the doping level .",
    "electrical measurements at high doping @xcite yield mobilities in the range of 100 - 300  @xmath118v@xmath52s@xmath52 for carrier densities between @xmath119 and @xmath120  @xmath8 ; these data are shown as black circles in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b - c .",
    "were we to consider only electron - phonon scattering and electron - hole pair generation , we would overestimate the experimental mobilities by more than an order of magnitude ( red and yellow lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) .",
    "impurity scattering reduces this discrepancy to some extent , but there remains a residual difference at the highest doping levels .",
    "it is only upon accounting for electron - plasmon scattering that the calculations exhibit a trend in qualitative and even semi - quantitative agreement with experiments throughout the entire doping range .",
    "in particular the scattering by plasmons is key to explain the anomalous low mobility of 100  @xmath118v@xmath52s@xmath52 above @xmath121  @xmath8 . even through the inclusion of electron - plasmon scattering",
    "a residual discrepancy between theory and experiment is still observed , which we ascribe to the simplified models adopted in the description of electronic scattering with electron - hole pairs and impurities .",
    "this observation leads us to suggest that the origin of the mobility overestimation in earlier calculations could be connected with the neglect of electron - plasmon scattering @xcite .",

    "<S> s1 @xcite , the explicit inclusion of electron - phonon scattering is essential to achieve a good agreement with experiment . on the other hand , were we to consider only electron - phonon scattering and electron - hole pair generation , we would overestimate the experimental mobilities by more than an order of magnitude .    the real part of the electron self - energy in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sigma ] ) allows us to evaluate the renormalization of the electron energy levels arising from the dressing of electron quasiparticles by virtual plasmons . </S>",
    "<S> since the renormalization of semiconductor band gaps induced by electron - phonon interactions attracted considerable interest lately @xcite , we here concentrate on the quantum zero - point renormalization of the fundamental gap of silicon . computational details of the calculations and convergence tests are reported in the supplemental material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering for definiteness a carrier density of @xmath60  @xmath8 , we find that the electron - plasmon coupling lowers the conduction band edge by @xmath61  mev at zero temperature , and rises the valence band edge by @xmath62  mev . for carrier concentrations of </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63  @xmath8 and @xmath64  @xmath8 we verified that the bgn changes by less that 1  mev for temperatures up to 600  k ( see supplemental material @xcite ) . as a result at this doping concentration the band gap redshifts by @xmath65  mev </S>",

    "<S> the doping - induced band gap renormalization was also reported in a recent work on monolayer mos@xmath66 @xcite , therefore we expect this feature to hold general validity in doped semiconductors . in order to perform a quantitative comparison with experiment , we show in fig .  </S>",
