    "the spin composition of the proton in terms of its fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom is a central focus of proton structure . whether the quark orbital angular momentum is zero or not is one of the key points to solve this problem .",
    "the importance of quark orbital angular momentum , which one might have taken to vanish in the ground state , has been evident since the work of sehgal  @xcite .",
    "the orbital angular momentum structure of the proton is of considerable interest and much effort has gone into devising ways to measure it .",
    "recently , the investigation of single - spin asymmetries in hadronic processes suggests that the orbital angular momentum of quark in the proton is nonzero .",
    "this puts forward a challenging opportunity and imposes an important constraint on phenomenological studies .",
    "the measurements from the hermes and smc collaborations show a remarkably large single - spin asymmetry of the proton in semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "large single - spin asymmetries have also been seen in hadronic reactions such as @xmath5  @xcite , where the antiproton is polarized normal to the pion production plane , and @xmath6  @xcite , where the hyperon is polarized normal to the production plane .",
    "we focus on the semi - inclusive pion leptoproduction @xmath7 , because of the simplification with only one baryon in the initial state . to describe the single - spin asymmetries for the semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering @xmath8 , a non - zero sivers function @xmath9",
    "is usually used to reflect the asymmetric transverse momentum distribution of the quark in a transversely polarized proton .",
    "the sivers function @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the quark distributions in the transversely polarized proton for the direction up and down , respectively .",
    "the non - zero sivers function means that unpolarized quark distribution is different in up and down nucleon spin states .",
    "this difference can only originate from the coupling of quark spin and its orbital motion , and suggests non - zero quark orbital angular momentum which can contribute to spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "based on the nonzero quark orbital angular momentum and final or internal interaction , some theoretical predictions are available in the framework of mit bag model  @xcite and quark - diquark configurations  @xcite .",
    "the sivers functions obtained in these two models are different in sign and magnitude .",
    "it is suggested that the difference could be originated from sea - quark contributions  @xcite , which have opposite sign to that from valence quarks .",
    "recently , the five - quark components of specific configurations have been proposed and carried out in various aspects to understand the spin - flavor structure of proton and other baryons  @xcite . for the proton ,",
    "the possible five - quark configurations consist of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and so on . in these configurations ,",
    "the ones with @xmath2 ( @xmath17 ) in its ground state and the @xmath18 subsystem in p - state give proper results .",
    "then one can find that each @xmath19 or @xmath20 have @xmath21 probability to be in p - state .",
    "this gives a natural explanation of non - zero quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon . in this paper",
    ", we examine the single - spin asymmetry caused by the five - quark components in the proton .",
    "the importance of the quark orbital angular momentum in nucleon structure has been discussed by sehgal  @xcite and ratcliffe  @xcite in different contexts .",
    "the proton s  spin crisis \"  @xcite indicates the presence of quark orbital angular momentum .",
    "the probe of quark orbital momentum has become available after the detailed investigation of the composition of nucleon spin in terms of quark and gluon  @xcite and the generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite .",
    "the ssa can be viewed as one of the observable to measure the effect of quark angular momentum through the spin - orbit correlations  @xcite .",
    "there have been two mechanisms proposed beyond the naive parton model : the twist-3 quark - gluon - quark correlations and transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions , which is related to the quark orbital angular momentum in nucleon .",
    "the intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks is crucial to generate large ssa , because the nonzero quark orbital angular momentum can lead to the flip of the hadron helicity .",
    "there have already been many works about the relations between quark orbital motion and ssas in different processes  @xcite with the conclusion that the nonzero quark orbital angular momentum is necessary to produce the large ssa",
    ".    however , in the classic qqq configuration of the nucleon , all quarks are in the s - wave and give a zero orbital angular momentum .",
    "hence one must go beyond the simple qqq quark model by including additional @xmath23 pair(s ) .",
    "the five - quark @xmath24 components in the proton with the @xmath25 of negative intrinsic parity demands either a quark or anti - quark in the p - wave to make up the proton of positive intrinsic parity .",
    "so it gives naturally the nonzero quark orbital angular momentum .    in the five - quark component model  @xcite , there are significant @xmath26 and @xmath27 components in the proton with the anti - quark in the orbital ground state and the four quarks in the mixed orbital @xmath28_x$ ] symmetry , i.e. , one in p - wave and three in s - wave , together with flavor - spin @xmath29_{fs}[22]_f[22]_s$ ] symmetry .",
    "this kind of configuration is found to have the lowest energy no matter whether the hyperfine interaction between quarks is described by the color magnetic interaction or by the flavor and spin dependent hyperfine interaction of chiral quark model @xcite .",
    "in fact , this configuration is very similar to the jaffe - wilczek s diquark configuration for penta - quarks @xcite .",
    "only two quarks with different flavors can form a good diquark . obviously the @xmath30 can not form this kind of configuration and can only in configurations with higher energies . hence in the proton ,",
    "there is less @xmath31 component than @xmath26 component .",

    "it was found that the nucleon strange quark content is suppressed with respect to the non - strange sea quarks by a factor @xmath40 under the assumption of @xmath35-@xmath41 symmetry .",
    "if allowing @xmath35-@xmath41 asymmetry , then the fit gives @xmath42 .",
    "this was echoed by meson cloud models , such as ref.@xcite , which gives @xmath43 .",

    "the lower limit @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath52 .    in our model calculation",
    "we assume that the @xmath15 system stays in the configuration of the lowest energy @xcite where the @xmath53 is in its ground state and the @xmath54 subsystem has mixed orbital symmetry @xmath28_{x}$ ] .",
    "this configuration gives the possibility of 1/4 for @xmath20 to be in p - wave hence leads naturally to spin flip .",
    "considering the electroproduction process @xmath55 in the five - quark component model of nucleon , the basic elcetroproduction reaction is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 represents the final quark which joins in the remaining part of the nucleon to form the hadronic state x , as illustrated in fig . 1 .

    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be taken as the probed quarks in the nucleon , while the rest partons can be taken as the spectators collectively in the scattering process .",

    "<S> we examine the single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) caused by the five - quark components of the proton for semi - inclusive electroproduction of charged pions in deep - inelastic scattering on a transversely polarized hydrogen target . </S>",
    "<S> the large ssa is considered to have close relation with quark orbital motion in the proton and suggests that the quark orbital angular momentum is nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> for the five - quark @xmath0 components of the proton , the lowest configurations with @xmath1 system orbitally excited and the @xmath2 in the ground state would give spin - orbit correlations naturally for the quarks in a polarized proton . we show that based on the basic reaction @xmath3 , the orbital - spin coupling of the probed quarks in the five - quark configuration leads to the single - spin asymmetry consistent with recent experiment results . </S>"
