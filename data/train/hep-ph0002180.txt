    "when studying a physical system it is often the case that there is not enough information to provide a fundamental description of some of its properties . in such cases one must parameterize the corresponding effects by introducing new interactions with coefficients to be determined phenomenologically .",
    "experimental limits or measurement of these parameters then ( hopefully ) provides the information needed to provide a more satisfactory description .    a standard procedure for doing this is to first determine the dynamical degrees of freedom involved and the symmetries obeyed , and then construct the most general lagrangian , the _ _ for these degrees of freedom which respects the required symmetries .",
    "the method is straightforward , quite general and , most importantly , _ it works ! _    in following this approach one must be wary of several facts .",
    "fist it is clear that the relevant degrees of freedom can change with scale ( e.g. mesons are a good description of low - energy qcd , but at higher energies one should use quarks and gluons ) ; in addition , physics at different scales may respect different symmetries ( e.g. mass conservation is violated at sufficiently high energies ) .",
    "it follows that the  formalism is in general applicable only for a limited range of scales .",
    "it is often the case ( but no always ! ) that there is a scale @xmath0 so that the results obtained using an are invalid for energies above @xmath0 .",
    "the formalism has two potentially serious drawbacks .",
    "first ,  has an infinite number of terms suggesting a lack of predictability .",
    "second , even though the model has an uv cutoff @xmath1 and will not suffer from actual divergences , simple calculations show that is is a possible for this type of theories to generating radiative corrections that grow with @xmath0 , becoming increasingly important for higher and higher order graphs . either of these problems can render this approach useless .",
    "it is also necessary verify that the model is unitary .",
    "i will discuss below how these problems are solved , an provide several applications of the formalism .",
    "the aim is to give a flair of the versatility of the approach , not to provide an exhaustive review of all known applications .",

    "only photons appear in real processes and the  will be then constructed using the photon field @xmath2 , and will satisfy a @xmath3 gauge and lorenz invariances .",
    "thus it can be constructed in terms of the field strength @xmath4 or the loop variables @xmath5 .",

    "though we know qed respects c and p , it is possible for other interactions to violate these symmetries , there is nothing in the discussion above that disallows such terms and , in fact , weak effects will generate them .",

    "we must be able to at least estimate the relation between these constants and the underlying scales .    to 1.4in=4 in [ f1 ]    in addition we also know that @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a very small constant proportional to the jarlskog determinant  @xcite .",
    "the  can hold terms with radically different scales and limits on some constants can not , in general , translate to others . in this case",
    "the terms are characterized by different cp transformation properties , and it is often the case that such global symmetries are useful in differentiating terms in the . the point being that a term violating a given global symmetry at scale @xmath23 will generate all terms in the  with the same symmetry properties through radiative corrections .",
    "the caveat in the argument being that the underlying theory might have some additional symmetries not apparent at low energies which might further segregate interactions and so provide different scales for operators with the same properties under all low energy symmetries .",
    "when calculating with the  the effects produced by the new terms proportional to @xmath24 are suppressed by a factor @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the typical energy on the process and @xmath27 .",
    "thus the effects of these terms are tiny , yet they are noticeable because they generate a _ new _ effect : @xmath28 scattering .      this is a brief summary of the very nice treatment provided by polchinski  @xcite .",
    "the system under consideration has the electron field @xmath29 as its only dynamical variable ( the phonons are assumed to have been integrated out , generating a series of electron self - interactions ) , it respects @xmath3 electromagnetic gauge invariance , as well as galilean invariance and fermion number conservation .    assuming a local description , the first few terms in the  expansion are ( neglecting those containing photons for simplicity ) @xmath30   \\psi_\\kk + \\int \\psi^*_\\kk \\psi_\\lll \\psi_\\qq \\psi^*_\\pp   \\delta(\\kk-\\lll-\\qq+\\pp ) v_{\\kk\\lll\\qq}+ \\cdots\\ ] ]    in this equation the relation @xmath31 determines the fermi surface , while @xmath32 summarizes the virtual phonon effects . in order to determine the importance of the various terms we need the dimensions of the field @xmath33 .",

    "scaling towards the fs implies @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",

    "the quartic terms in the action then scales as @xmath40 and becomes negligible near the fs _ except _ when the pairing condition @xmath41 is obeyed . in this case",
    "the quartic term scales as @xmath42 and can not be ignored . in fact",
    "this term determines the most interesting behavior of the system at low temperatures ( see  @xcite for full details ) .",
    "again i will follow the general recipe .",
    "i will concentrate only on the ( low energy ) interactions involving lepton fields , which are then the degrees of freedom . since i assume the energy to be well below the fermi scale , the only relevant symmetries are @xmath3 gauge and lorenz invariances .",
    "in addition there is the question whether the heavy physics will respect the discrete symmetries @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 ; using perfect hindsight i will retain terms that violate these symmetries    assuming a local description i have  @xcite @xmath46 where the ellipsis indicate terms containing operators of higher dimension , or those involving the electromagnetic field .",
    "the matrices @xmath47 are to be chosen among the 16 independent basis @xmath48    the coefficients for the first two terms are be fixed by normalization requirements . while a sm calculation gives @xmath49 ( @xmath50gev ) and is generated by tree - level graphs ( see fig .",

    "the contributions of the four - fermion operators to processes with typical energy @xmath26 are suppressed by a factor @xmath53 . these can be observed ( or bounded ) despite the @xmath54 condition because they generate _ new _ effects : @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( and some of them chirality ) violation .    to 1in=6.3 in [ f2 ]      in this case we are interested in the description of the interactions among the lightest hadrons , the meson multiplet .",
    "the most convenient parameterization of these degrees of freedom is in terms of a unitary field@xcite @xmath55 such that @xmath56 where @xmath57 denote the eight meson fields , @xmath58 the gell - mann matrices and @xmath6 is a constant ( related to the pion decay constant ) .",

    "the effects form the higher - order terms have been measured and the data requires @xmath62 .",
    "this result is also predicted by the consistency of this approach which requires that radiative corrections to @xmath63 , @xmath15 , etc .",
    "should be at most of the same size as their tree - level values .",
    "being a model with intrinsic an cutoff there are no actual ultraviolet divergences in most  computations .",
    "still there are interesting renormalizability issues that arise when doing effective lagrangian loop computations .",
    "imagine doing a loop calculation including some vertices terms of ( mass ) dimension higher than the dimension of space - time .",
    "these must have coefficients with dimensions of mass to some negative power .",
    "the loop integrations will produce in general terms growing with @xmath0 the uv cutoff which are polynomials in the external momenta   and will preserve the symmetries of the model  @xcite .",
    "hence these terms which may _ grow _ with @xmath0 correspond to vertices appearing in the most general   and can be absorbed in a renormalization of the corresponding coefficients .",
    "they have no observable effects ( though they can be used in naturality arguments  @xcite .",
    "effective theories will also be unitary _ provided _ one stays within the limits of their applicability .",
    "should one exceed them new channels will open ( corresponding to the production of the heavy excitations ) and unitarity violating effects will occur .",
    "this is _ not _ produced by real unitarity violating interactions , but due to our using the model beyond its range of applicability ( e.g. it the typical energy of the process under consideration reaches of exceeds @xmath0 ) .",
    "one can , of course , _ extend _ the model , but this necessarily introduces _ ad - hoc _ elements and will dilute the generality gained using effective theories .",
    "for example consider @xmath64 interactions with an  of the form @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 ) one can then choose @xmath67 to insure unitarity is preserved ( at least in some processes ) , for example  @xcite @xmath68 which , for @xmath69 sufficiently large insures that the cross section for the reaction @xmath70 is unitary , since it behaves as @xmath71 for a cm energy@xmath72 .",
    "but the very same effective vertex also modifies other reactions such as , for example @xmath73 where the cross section now has a factor @xmath74 and will exhibit resonant behavior if @xmath75 . if one requires @xmath76 ( as required by the consistency of the formalism )",
    "there are neither unitarity violations nor resonance effects .",
    "if , however , one uses the above ansatz to extend the range of applicability to @xmath77 and beyond then very clear resonances should be observed in hadron colliders . given",
    "that these have not been observed one _ must _ use for @xmath0 a value significantly larger than the average cm energy for the hard @xmath78 pair production cross section .",
    "effective lagrangians provide an efficient way of summarizing some ( perhaps very complex ) interactions .",
    "the idea is simply to include all the effective vertices produces by those excitations which are not directly observed .",
    "for example given a real scalar field @xmath79 and assume that all fourier components above a scale @xmath0 are not directly observable ( i.e. the available energies lie all below @xmath0 ) , then the  is obtained by integrating over the variables observable at energies @xmath80 ; writing @xmath81 , with @xmath82 then by definition @xmath83 e^{i s(\\phi_0,\\phi_1 ) } , \\qquad s_{\\rm eff } = \\int d^n x \\leff\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is obtained by expanding @xmath85 in powers of @xmath86 which gives an infinite tower of local operators .",

    "if one knows the theory we can , in principle , calculate @xmath94 ( or do a full calculation ) .",
    "yet there are many cases where the underlying theory is not known . in these cases an effective theory if obtained by writing _",
    "all _ possible interactions among the light excitations .",
    "the model then has an infinite number of terms each with an unknown parameter , and these constants then parameterize _ all _ possible underlying theories .",
    "the terms which dominate are those usually called renormalizable ( or , equivalently , marginal or relevant ) . the other terms are called non - renormalizable , or irrelevant , since their effects become smaller as the energy decreases    this recipe for writing effective theories must be supplemented with some symmetry restrictions .",
    "the most important being that the all the terms in the  must respect the local gauge invariance of the low - energy physics ( more technically , the one respected by the renormalizable terms in the effective action )  @xcite .",

    "- parity the cp violating effects are small within the and so precise measurements of cp violating observable might be very sensitive to new physics effects .    in order to study cp violations it is useful to first define what the cp transformation _ is_. in order to do this in general denote the cartan group generators by @xmath206 and the root generators by @xmath207 , then it is possible to find a basis where _ all _ the group generators are real and , in addition , the @xmath206 are diagonal  @xcite .",

    "one obtains @xmath232 and the corresponding free propagator is given by @xmath233 the field is periodic in @xmath222 due to the commutativity of the variables in the functional integral ( there is a much more physical reason , called the kubo - martin - schwinger condition )  @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath234 modes become heavy as @xmath235 so that in this limit only the @xmath236 modes remain and the theory reduces to a 3-d euclidean field theory ( there might be some subtleties involved , see below ) .",

    "there will be then no fermions in the spectrum at very large temperatures .",
    "note that this occurs independently of the fermion mass  @xcite .    despite the absence of heavy fermions and scalars ( effective mass @xmath239 ) at large temperatures",
    ", we can still ask what is their effect on the scalar modes that survive in this regime . to this end",
    "we can construct the corresponding effective theory .",
    "i will illustrate the procedure using a simple example .",
    "consider the following scalar theory @xmath240 then the excitations which survive at large @xmath166 are @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the dynamical variable of a 3 dimensional euclidean field theory ( in 3 dimensions the scalar fields have units of @xmath243 which explains the @xmath244 factor ) .",
    "the only symmetry ( aside form euclidean invariance ) is the reflection symmetry @xmath245 .",
    "the scale of the new theory is set by @xmath246 , but in this case the model is supposed to describe physics _ above _",

    "[ f7 ] a simple estimate ( verified by explicit calculation ) shows that @xmath251 which corresponds to the operator @xmath252 whose coefficient has _ positive _ powers of @xmath253 and are not suppressed at large temperatures .",
    "in fact , should this be correct the , effective theory expansion would be useless .    to 1.4in=6 in [ f7 ]",
    "the solution to this infrared problem ( diverging effective coefficients as @xmath254 is well known for this type of theories  @xcite : the propagator for the @xmath236 mode gets dressed and in so doing the @xmath255 gets shifted by an amount @xmath256 . explicitly , the graphs in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] shift @xmath257 so that the previous expression for the effective operator coefficient becomes @xmath258 which vanishes as @xmath259 .",

    "just as for the scalar field , the gauge field is periodic in @xmath261 and can be expanded in fourier modes . at high temperatures , all but the @xmath236 modes are heavy with masses @xmath262 .",
    "the remaining light modes are @xmath263 leaving a 3-d euclidean @xmath264 model with gauge fields @xmath265 and with a scalar octet ( the @xmath266 ) .",

    "but this effect is not extended to the @xmath271 for the corresponding vacuum polarization obeys @xmath272  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the   remain massless leads to various interesting problems .",

    "when the internal lines represent @xmath278 ( or , equivalently , @xmath271 ) propagator a problem will arise unless @xmath279 is generated ( we already know there is no @xmath280 correction to @xmath188 ) .",
    "this so - called magnetic mass has not been obtained perturbatively though it is widely believed to be generated .    to 1.5in=8 in [ f9 ]",
    "additional problems arise since the gauge coupling constant in the 3-d theory has dimensions of @xmath243 leading to super - renormalizable interactions with the related infrared divergences  @xcite .",
