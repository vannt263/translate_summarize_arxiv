    "most measurements of the physical properties of astronomical objects are fortunate to obtain an accuracy of a factor of two .",
    "the rare instances when more precise measurements are possible offer significant opportunities for advancing our knowledge , and so it is worth investing some effort to understand these objects in detail .",
    "the orbiting water maser spots in provide one of these rare instances .",
    "water maser emission was first detected in the nucleus of by @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that the masers might lie in a disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discovered high velocity maser emission , which @xcite quickly interpreted as a natural outcome of maser emission from a disk .",
    "vlbi observations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) demonstrated that the maser spots are positioned on the sky as one would expect for a nearly edge - on thin disk .",
    "a model fit to the maser spots allows one to determine the central mass ( @xcite ) . by measuring maser spot accelerations",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , or proper motions ( @xcite ) one can also directly determine a geometric distance .",
    "the measurement of an accurate mass and distance eliminate two of the principal uncertainties that plague efforts to understand the physics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the mass of the central object in ( which we will freely refer to as a black hole ) is @xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xmath7 ) .",
    "the distance is measured to be @xmath8 , with independent and consistent results from measurements of maser spot acceleration and maser spot proper motion ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the other main uncertainties that plagues agn studies is the accretion rate @xmath9 .",
    "the accretion rate in has been controversial , and there are a number of estimates in the literature : @xcite(hereafter nm ) , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the usual dimensionless angular momentum diffusion coefficient of accretion disk theory ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; @xcite , @xmath12 ; @xcite , @xmath13 ; @xcite , @xmath14 ; @xcite , @xmath15 .",
    "these estimates differ because of disagreements about the nature and efficiency of angular momentum transport in disks and , to a lesser degree , because of disagreements about the heating and cooling physics in various parts of the accretion flow .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify some of these differences , propose observational tests that reduce the number of acceptable models , and thereby narrow the range of uncertainty in @xmath9 .",
    "we begin in  2 by asking what the masing disk might tell us about the accretion rate . in ",
    "3 we give a critical review of the pertinent data ; in  4 we consider models for the inner accretion flow ; in  5 we consider implications of observations of the jet .",
    "a discussion and summary of interesting observational and theoretical problems follows in  6 .",
    "most estimates of the accretion rate in are based on observations of the masing disk and the assumption that the disk is in a steady state ( @xmath16 ) from the masing disk in to the black hole , where most of the gravitational binding energy is released ( nm , @xcite ) . but is the masing disk in a steady state ? in the absence of significant external torques (",
    "e.g. a magnetohydrodynamic wind ) one expects a steady state to be achieved on the viscous timescale @xmath17 , if mass is steadily supplied to the disk from @xmath18 .    in the masing disk , @xmath19 .",
    ", as suggested by nm , might carry a large @xmath9 with a small viscous timescale .",
    "but in the nm model , at least , most of the mass flux is carried in the cool , optically thick component at the inner edge of the masing disk .",
    "] this is a significant fraction of a hubble time .",
    "we know of no direct evidence that mass has been steadily supplied to the nucleus of , or to any active nucleus , on this timescale .",
    "thus there is no direct support for the assumption that the disk is in a steady state .",
    "contains an unusual , @xmath20-scale jet detected in optical lines ( @xcite ) , radio continuum ( @xcite ) , and x - rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the jet is produced in the immediate vicinity of the black hole , and the jet mass loss rate is closely coupled to the accretion rate , as is commonly believed , then it provides a fossil record of past accretion .",
    "the characteristic timescale for the jet is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the jet radial velocity .",
    "more detailed models of the jet suggest an age of at least @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( e.g. @xcite ) . thus the jet provides a record over only a small fraction of the masing disk viscous timescale .",
    "the jet is roughly continuous over its length , however ( there are no lengthy gaps in the jets : see for example figure 2 of @xcite ) , which suggests approximately steady accretion over a time @xmath25 . for standard @xmath26 disk models for the inner accretion flow",
    "we find @xmath27 at @xmath28 ( the precise value depends on the accretion rate , @xmath26 , etc . ) .",
    "thus only a small region of the accretion flow in needs to be in a steady state .",
    "@xcite have recently reported j , h , and k band ( @xmath29 ) observations of in @xmath30 seeing . using the j band image as a baseline , they subtract a scaled j band image from the h and k images and find a nuclear emission excess consistent with a point source .",
    "the excess is @xmath31 at h and @xmath32 at k. it is then possible to deduce the extinction and intrinsic luminosity of the source if the extinction follows a standard form deduced from the local interstellar medium ( @xcite ) and if the intrinsic spectrum has an approximately power - law form over the region of interest ( @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 the spectral index @xmath37 might reasonably range from @xmath38 for the classical thin disk spectrum to @xmath39 , which is a typical optical spectral index for an unobscured agn .",
    "the implied flux at j is @xmath40 , which is small , justifying the use of the j band image as a baseline . taking @xmath41 ( @xcite ) , the extinction implies an obscuring column @xmath42 ( @xmath43 metallicity ) or , assuming cosmic abundance of helium , @xmath44    these estimates are sensitive to the assumed extinction curve , since @xmath45 and @xmath46 evidently @xmath47 variations in extinction can lead to factor - of - two errors in the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "@xcite have reported x - ray observations of with asca .",
    "they fit a four component model to the spectrum , including an obscured power law , an iron line , a raymond - smith plasma , and thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "they find an integrated luminosity for the power law component in the @xmath48 to @xmath49 band of @xmath50 ( at @xmath51 ) , and an absorbing column @xmath52 . assuming a cosmic abundance of helium , this implies @xmath53 .",
    "the x - ray column is a factor of @xmath54 larger than the column inferred from infrared extinction which , given the uncertainties , may be considered reasonably good agreement .",
    "indeed , the two columns need not agree if the ir emitting material is also producing the x - ray absorption .",
    "the integrated luminosity implies @xmath55 at @xmath56 , taking the mean of @xmath57 across the @xmath48 to @xmath49 band .",
    "makishima et al.s data are now publicly available through the asca data archives .",
    "we have tried fitting only an absorbed power law to the @xmath58 to @xmath49 data . while the total luminosity is robust , being mostly determined by the flux near @xmath49 , our absorption column is lower than the makishima et al . value .",
    "this suggests that the derived absorption column is sensitive to the presence of the thermal bremsstrahlung component in the makishima et al .",
    "model , and may be somewhat less reliable than the total luminosity .",
    "@xcite report a @xmath59 upper limit on the @xmath60 flux from the neighborhood of the compact object of @xmath61 , or @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite report a detection in a @xmath63 aperture at @xmath64 of @xmath65 , or @xmath66 .",
    "a consistent result at similar aperture size is reported by @xcite . because of the large aperture these are upper limits .",
    "finally , the nucleus has been detected in polarized optical light by @xcite .",
    "the polarized continuum has @xmath67 , with an amplitude @xmath68 .",
    "the polarized spectral lines have fwhm of order @xmath69 , a velocity characteristic of radii just within the radius of the masing disk .",
    "these results offer only weak constraints on @xmath9 because the composition and distribution of the scattering medium are poorly constrained . following wilkes et al .",
    "we will regard the polarized emission as providing an upper limit on @xmath57 of @xmath70 .",
    "the jet in is observed at milliarcsecond scales in @xmath60 continuum with the vlba ( @xcite ) and at arcsecond and larger scales in the radio , optical , and x - ray .",
    "the vlba jet was discovered by @xcite , while higher signal - to - noise data has recently been presented by @xcite .",
    "the northern jet has flux density @xmath71 , is variable on a timescale of weeks , and is unresolved .",
    "its mean location is about @xmath72 ( @xmath73 light - days @xmath74 ) north of the best - fit location for the compact object , and its position varies significantly with time .",
    "the southern jet has flux density @xmath75 , has not varied significantly in flux or position , and is also unresolved .",
    "it is located about @xmath76 ( @xmath77 light - days @xmath78 ) south of the best - fit location for the compact object .",
    "the difference in brightness between northern and southern jet is attributed by @xcite to free - free absorption in the masing disk .",
    "the emitting blobs are approximately due south and north of the compact central object ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the jet being normal to the outer , masing disk and suggests that the disk is not strongly warped , at least in position angle , between the masing disk and the radius where the jet is launched .",
    "radio and x - ray observations show a curious , twisted jet outflow both to the north and the south extending out to @xmath79  kpc ( summarized in @xcite ) .",
    "the jet x - ray emission has a power @xmath80  erg s@xmath81 and can be satisfactorily fit by a thermal spectrum with temperature @xmath82  k. associated with this jet are forbidden emission lines which appear to come from locally photoionized shocked plasma .",
    "the line widths suggest velocities @xmath83  km s@xmath81 .",
    "an observed flux @xmath84 suggests a minimum accretion rate @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the accretion efficiency . this is not a rigorous limit",
    "since the flow can emit anisotropically and a spinning black hole can provide an additional reservoir of energy .",
    "setting aside these concerns for the moment , it is reasonable to take @xmath87 ( recall that the specific binding energy on the last stable circular orbit varies from @xmath88 for retrograde orbits around a maximally rotating black hole to @xmath89 for prograde orbits around a maximally rotating hole ; this binding energy is approximately related to the efficiency @xmath90 of a thin disk accretion flow ) .",
    "taking the observed flux densities in the infrared , integrating over the band , and adding this to the @xmath91 flux ( while this is corrected for absorption , the total flux is not sensitive to the absorption ) , we find @xmath92 .",
    "this assumes the rest of the spectrum is black ( which is not correct given the detection of scattered light in the optical by @xcite ) and the infrared extinction is zero .",
    "a less radically skeptical approach is to set the luminosity equal to the extinction - corrected infrared @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath93 .",
    "the rest of the spectrum is not black . by analogy with other agn , should have a rather flat spectrum in @xmath57 .",
    "one can then ask what is the minimum luminosity in a power law spectral energy distribution that extends from the optical to @xmath94 and passes through the x - ray data point ; we find the minimal power law slope is @xmath95 , and the corresponding luminosity is @xmath96 . adding this to the minimal accretion rate from the infrared point gives @xmath97 although some of the optical , uv , and soft x - ray flux may be absorbed by a disk and reradiated in the infrared .",
    "so far we have assumed that the accretion flow radiates isotropically , but a thin disk , for example , has @xmath98 , if we ignore the effects of limb - brightening .",
    "since the masing disk inclination is @xmath99 , and the most natural assumption is that the inner disk has the same inclination ( although there is no direct evidence for this ) , there will also be a large additional upward correction in the mass accretion rate , since @xmath100 . a specific model is required for a quantitative estimate of the inclination correction .",
    "suppose that the central engine is just a thin , flat disk that radiates locally like a black body .",
    "on the @xmath101 portion of the classical thin disk spectrum , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is in microns and @xmath104 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath105 .",
    "inverting this equation , the required mass accretion rate is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is in @xmath108 . assuming @xmath109 and @xmath110 , the infrared data of chary & becklin require @xmath111 .",
    "notice that the inclination correction is quite large because @xmath9 depends nonlinearly on @xmath112 .",
    "this also assumes the disk extends down to @xmath113 ; if the disk is truncated properly ( say at @xmath114 ) then @xmath9 must be evaluated numerically : @xmath115 .",
    "thin disk spectra for @xmath116 and @xmath117 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "there are several effects that might tend to change the accretion rate .",
    "first , the inner disk might be inclined differently from the masing disk .",
    "if @xmath118 , then the accretion rate can be pushed as low as @xmath119 ; the order of magnitude change in @xmath120 again follows from the nonlinear dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath112 in eq.([fneqn ] ) .",
    "it is also possible , however , that the inclination of the inner disk is larger than @xmath121 .",
    "second , the obscuring dust grains might well have a different size distribution than in the local interstellar medium .",
    "the sense of the effect of grain size evolution , however , at least in the grain models of @xcite , is to decrease @xmath122 and so increase the required mass accretion rate .",
    "third , some of the near - infrared emission may be reprocessed light from the central engine , either in a disk or in a wind ( e.g. @xcite ) . crudely speaking",
    ", the light must be reprocessed at @xmath123 corresponding to a characteristic temperature of @xmath124 for near ir emission ( dust grains much smaller than @xmath125 can produce h and k band emission from a somewhat larger radius because they radiate inefficiently in the infrared ) .",
    "when is reprocessing important in a disk ?",
    "suppose @xmath126 is the `` obliquity '' of the disk , which is to say , the angle between the normal to the disk surface and the radius vector , @xmath127 is the fraction of intercepted radiation that is thermalized in the disk ( so @xmath128 is an effective albedo ) . then reprocessing is dominant if @xmath129 .",
    "for a thin , flared disk @xmath130 .",
    "one can then show that , in a standard @xmath26 disk model over a large range of @xmath9 , reprocessing is not dominant at @xmath131 .",
    "if the disk is warped then @xmath132 can be larger and reprocessing can dominate internal heating .",
    "it is not possible to survey the warp parameter space , since a warp is described by two free functions : the inclination @xmath133 and position angle @xmath134 .",
    "a broad range of behavior is possible .",
    "for example , the warp could be made sufficiently large so as to cover the central engine ( raising the inferred accretion rate ) ; it could also be arranged so that the inner disk is nearly face on ( lowering the inferred accretion rate ) .    as an illustration , however",
    ", we have constructed a `` naive '' warped disk model with only an inclination warp ( @xmath135 ) in which the reprocessed light is reradiated as a black body .",
    "the disk extends from @xmath114 to @xmath136 , as does the flat disk model , and has constant @xmath9 .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath137 of the disk is given by @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the effective temperature in the absence of external heating , and @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "here @xmath142 is the obliquity factor . if the disk is illuminated on the side facing us , then @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the disk orbital phase .",
    "if the disk is illuminated on the side facing away from us , as it is for half its orbit , then the reprocessing only adds a flux @xmath145 to our side of the disk , and so , assuming that @xmath146 , we set @xmath147 .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting thin , warped disk spectrum .",
    "the warp extends from @xmath148 to @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",
    "the accretion rate is @xmath151 .",
    "three effects combine here to reduce the required accretion rate : ( 1 ) reprocessing enhances the @xmath152 flux ; ( 2 ) reprocessing make the spectrum shallower at @xmath152 thus reducing the reddening correction ; ( 3 ) the inclination warp changes the inclination of the inner disk from @xmath121 to @xmath153 , thus making the reprocessing portion of the disk more face - on .",
    "our warped disk model is naive in the sense that the reprocessed emission does not emerge as a blackbody .",
    "in particular , dust grains in the disk atmosphere can cause half of the flux intercepted by the disk to reemerge as a dilute blackbody with @xmath154 .",
    "this effect has been considered in the context of quasar disks by @xcite and @xcite ; the same effect has been considered in the context of circumstellar disks by @xcite . in phinney",
    "s quasar models the resulting spectrum has a notch at @xmath155 related to the onset of dust sublimation at @xmath156 . since the spectrum might then be declining at @xmath157 and @xmath158 bands , this could reduce the reddening correction and thus also reduce the required accretion rate .    reprocessing is ultimately limited , however , by the luminosity of the central accretion flow .",
    "figure 1 also shows a thin disk spectrum for a face - on disk truncated at @xmath159 , with @xmath160 , corresponding to the model of @xcite with @xmath161",
    ". it would be difficult to produce the observed infrared flux from such a low accretion rate disk even with a highly optimized arrangement of reprocessing material .",
    "a reprocessing model for the h and k band flux can be tested via long term monitoring .",
    "if the light is reprocessed , then ir variability should be highly correlated with x - ray variability , with delays on order the light travel time @xmath162 .",
    "finally , while we have not explicitly fit the x - ray emission using a thin disk plus corona model ( e.g. @xcite ) , it is generally acknowledged that it is possible to do so , since there are a number of free parameters associated with the corona .",
    "an alternative to the thin disk plus corona model for the inner accretion flow is the two - temperature advection - dominated accretion flow model ( adaf ; @xcite ; see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "adafs are optically thin and geometrically thick , with @xmath163 .",
    "they have been used to successfully fit the spectral energy distribution of accretion flows onto both stellar mass and supermassive black holes . in their simplest form ,",
    "adafs approximate the flow as non - radiative , with nested spherical surfaces moving radially inwards with an angular velocity given by the value on the equatorial plane .",
    "radial pressure gradients combine with centrifugal force to oppose gravity and radial motion is fast , though subsonic until it approaches the event horizon .",
    "there is hypothesized to be a large viscous stress ( @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the pressure ) that transports angular momentum radially outward .",
    "the adaf approach has some dynamical shortcomings .",
    "firstly , it does not take account of angular velocity gradients on spherical surfaces .",
    "this appears to be a reasonable approximation far from the black hole in the self - similar region of the flow ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but the approximation may break down close to the hole , especially close to the symmetry axis .",
    "this is relevant for understanding whether the flow forms a funnel and a jet .",
    "the indications are that there is no funnel when @xmath166 ( @xcite , though this conclusion is not certain ) .",
    "secondly , the solutions assume vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , which is suspect in the supersonic region close to the hole .",
    "this approximation should not have direct impact on the emergent radiation , though .",
    "finally , in these solutions , the gas has positive bernoulli constant and always has enough energy to escape the hole ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this arises because of the inevitable , outward radial transport of energy by the viscous stress , which is balanced exactly by inward advective transport of energy .",
    "this balance must be maintained everywhere . if it is not , then it is possible that energy may be carried away by a wind ( see @xcite , and in preparation ) .",
    "counterbalancing these shortcomings is the fact that the adaf is the only model of hot accretion flows that attempts to calculate the dynamics , thermal structure and radiative spectrum of the gas self - consistently .",
    "other approaches , e.g. coronal models , leave most details of the dynamics unspecified and allow far greater freedom in choosing the properties of the radiating plasma .",
    "@xcite proposed a model for which comprises a thin disk extending outward from the transition radius @xmath167 and an adaf extending inward to the black hole .",
    "the mass accretion rate in the model is essentially fixed by the x - ray data point to be of order @xmath168 ; lasota et al .",
    "take @xmath169 .",
    "one free parameter remains : @xmath167 . at the time @xcite was written the data",
    "did not constrain @xmath167 .",
    "two results have since appeared that do : the @xmath170 upper limit of @xcite , and the ir detections of @xcite .",
    "there has also been considerable improvement in the calculation of the adaf model spectral energy distribution .",
    "relativistic effects ( @xcite , and references therein ) and advective heating of the electrons ( @xcite ) are now included ; details of the computation are described in @xcite , which applies the adaf model to the galactic center source sgr a@xmath171 .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectral energy distribution of corresponding to three adaf models , with @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which we call models @xmath174 and @xmath48 .",
    "the disk outside @xmath167 is thin , flat , and radiates like a blackbody .",
    "all models use the standard values for other parameters : @xmath175 and @xmath176 ( @xmath177 , @xmath178 fraction of dissipation going into electrons ) .",
    "model @xmath179 has the most ( least ) flux in the optical ( radio ) .",
    "evidently model @xmath179 fits the ir data best and does not violate the @xmath60 upper limit , although the model @xmath180 also gives an acceptable fit to the ir data and may have better agreement with the spectral index of the scattered optical light .",
    "model 2 is close to violating the @xmath60 upper limit .",
    "the adaf model predicts the flux from the central accretion flow at several wavelengths that may be observed in the near future . at @xmath64 the observed flux",
    "should not be below the thin disk value ( see equation [ [ fneqn ] ] ) of @xmath181 for models @xmath182 ; it can be larger because of reradiation by dust . at @xmath60",
    "the flux should be @xmath183 with @xmath184 for all three models .",
    "higher frequency interferometry may be possible ; at @xmath185 , with @xmath186 , and at @xmath187 . at @xmath188 the expected flux is @xmath189 with @xmath190 ; recall that @xcite find @xmath191 .",
    "the model is adjusted so that the flux at @xmath49 fits the observations ; at @xmath49 the predicted photon index is @xmath192 , which may be compared with the observed index of @xmath193 .",
    "finally , the expected flux at @xmath194 is @xmath195 , and the photon index for all three models is @xmath196 .      a related , though distinct , alternative to the adaf is the ion torus ( @xcite ) . as in the adaf",
    ", it is assumed that the plasma is two - temperature with most of the pressure being supplied by the ions ( see @xcite for the first application of the two - temperature idea to accretion ) and that the radiative losses are small .",
    "the viscosity is assumed to be small enough ( low @xmath26 ) , however , that poloidal motion can be ignored in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium . in its simplest manifestation ,",
    "the specific angular momentum is constant and the surface of the torus is a surface of constant binding energy . as the radiative losses are small , the binding energy is quite low ( relative to @xmath197 per unit mass ) and plasma flows onto the black hole through an equatorial cusp with this energy and consistent with having lost little of its binding energy .",
    "this approach can accommodate the peculiarly relativistic features of the kerr metric ( @xcite ) .",
    "following previous work on thick disks , the ion torus model simply specifies the angular momentum profile rather than solving an angular momentum equation , and this is a serious weakness . also , the model has no ready prescription for describing the gas inflow and , consequently , the thermal structure .",
    "in addition , tori of this sort are subject to hydrodynamical instability ( @xcite ) , which calls into question the assumption of slow angular momentum transport .",
    "nonetheless , ion tori do have one feature that is important in the present context : they naturally create a pair of funnels in which magnetic flux can be concentrated so as to extract energy from the central spinning black hole and power the jets . according to the work of @xcite and @xcite , funnels are likely to be most prominent in low-@xmath26 flows ( ion tori ) , and are much less pronounced in high-@xmath26 flows ( standard adafs ) .      the failure to detect radio emission from the location of the black hole",
    "has some more general implications .",
    "although we have demonstrated that adaf models can be made to be consistent with this upper limit , alternative models that admit a non - thermal distribution of relativistic electrons to be accelerated directly are quite tightly constrained .",
    "let us suppose that there is a radio photosphere where the optical depth to synchrotron self - absorption becomes unity .",
    "let it be located at a radial distance @xmath198  cm from the black hole .",
    "the 22  ghz upper bound on the flux implies that the radio brightness temperature of this photosphere must satisfy @xmath199 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding energy of the electrons emitting at @xmath60 is @xmath200 .",
    "these electrons radiate at @xmath201 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and so we conclude that the magnetic field strength at the photosphere satisfies @xmath202  g , ( assuming that it is significantly less than the cyclotron field , @xmath203  g ) . in other words",
    "the magnetic pressure must satisfy @xmath204 , measured in dyne @xmath205 .",
    "we use the theory of synchrotron radiation to solve for the radius of the 22  ghz photosphere : @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the ratio of the emitting electrons to the magnetic pressure .",
    "now , in order not to exceed the radio flux upper limit , we require that @xmath208 and , equivalently , @xmath209  dyne @xmath205 . as emphasized below , however , typical pressures in accretion flows are generally expected to exceed @xmath210  dyne @xmath205 by a large factor , so this is a fairly stringent constraint .",
    "adaf models satisfy this constraint because they ignore extraneous relativistic particle acceleration so that the electron distribution function is thermal and exponentially declining at energies below @xmath211 .",
    "( @xcite have shown that the thermalization time scale for the electrons in an adaf is shorter than the flow time scale , so that the assumption of a thermal particle distribution is consistent . )",
    "what we see from the analysis in this section is that this assumption is necessary .",
    "disk corona models generally do postulate relativistic particle acceleration .",
    "the accelerated particles might be expected to cause observable radio emission , and so the limit on the 22 ghz brightness temperature is a serious constraint .",
    "there are some processes which can suppress radio synchrotron emission .",
    "the razin effect is important at densities above @xmath212  @xmath213 .",
    "secondly , relativistic coulomb interactions and synchrotron loss may cool freshly accelerated electrons to keep their steady pressure at a low level .",
    "this happens on time scales competitive with the inflow timescale .",
    "thirdly , extrinsic free - free absorption may extinguish the radio source .",
    "two difficulties with this explanation are that the southern jet can be seen through the accreted gas at a projected perpendicular distance from the black hole of @xmath214 and that there is no observed soft x - ray absorption .",
    "it is clearly of interest to relate the observed vlbi jets to the gas flow close to the black hole .",
    "if we consider the northern vlbi component , we find that , at a projected distance of @xmath215  cm , the 22  ghz flux density is @xmath216  mjy . if we suppose that the unresolved source is the base of a jet with an opening angle of @xmath217 ( cf .",
    "@xcite)propagating nearly perpendicular to the line of sight with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath218 , then the radio brightness temperature is only @xmath219  k. even allowing for relativistic beaming this is too low for synchrotron self - absorption to be important and it seems reasonable to assume that both radio components are optically thin at this frequency .",
    "let us now assume that the relativistic energy density in the jet is not much smaller than the magnetic energy density .",
    "a straightforward calculation relates the minimum power carried by the relativistic electrons ( and , quite possibly , positrons ) in the jet to @xmath218 and to the ratio of the electron energy density to the magnetic energy density @xmath220 ( assumed @xmath221 ) : @xmath222 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the strong dependence of the minimum jet power upon the lorentz factor is due to a combination of the bulk energy and the diminution of the observed flux by relativistic beaming when the observer is located roughly perpendicular to the jet direction .",
    "we see that if jets have ultrarelativistic flow speeds , then they probably carry off significantly more power than is radiated directly .",
    "the power in the jet may be extracted directly from the spin of the black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "if instead , the power is derived from the accretion flow , then the jet implies a certain minimum mass accretion rate @xmath223 notice that this is similar to the estimates of @xmath224 obtained earlier by fitting the observed infrared spectrum .",
    "the pressure in the jet @xmath225  dyne @xmath205 must be confined transversely .",
    "if we evaluate this at the transition radius of the adaf solution , then the jet pressure is @xmath226  dyne @xmath205 . for comparison , the pressure in the adaf flow is @xmath227 we note that , although the formation of funnels appears to be problematic in adafs with @xmath166 ( @xcite ) , the pressure required to confine a jet able to account for the observed radio sources is probably present .",
    "an ion torus , by contrast , naturally forms a torus and can exert more pressure than a high-@xmath26 adaf as long as it is unable to cool . if the accretion rate is @xmath228  m@xmath229  yr@xmath81 , however , it does not seem possible to supply enough pressure to confine a relativistic jet .",
    "we have argued that the outer , masing disk in is unlikely to be in a steady state because of its long viscous timescale .",
    "thus it is questionable whether conditions in the masing disk can be used to estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole .",
    "we have fit several models to the spectral energy distribution of the nucleus in order to better constrain the accretion rate .",
    "the adaf model is able to fit all the data as long as @xmath230 , and the transition radius ( where the accretion flow makes the transition from a thin disk to an adaf ) is @xmath231 .",
    "the adaf accretion rate is basically fixed by the x - ray luminosity , but it is nicely consistent with the observed infrared flux as long as the infrared is generated by a thin , flat disk with inclination close to that of the masing disk .",
    "we have also fit pure thin disk models to the infrared data .",
    "( the x - ray flux would presumably be generated by a hot corona , but we have not constructed an explicit corona model , since coronae are not as tightly constrained as adafs . ) the inferred accretion rate is strongly inclination dependent . for @xmath232 , @xmath233",
    ". a lower accretion rate of @xmath234 is obtained by giving the disk an inclination of @xmath235 , although such a low inclination seems unlikely given the orientation of the large scale jet .",
    "the accretion rate can be further lowered by giving the disk a warp that reprocesses radiation from the central source into the infrared .",
    "since the warp parameter space is large , we have calculated the spectrum of a representative model disk with a modest warp , and the implied accretion rate is @xmath236 .",
    "the accretion rate might be pushed lower by a somewhat artificial positioning of reprocessing gas at the right radius ; this could push the accretion rate as low as @xmath237 , where @xmath37 is the slope of the intrinsic spectrum . for @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath169 (",
    "larger values seem unlikely except possibly in the event of gravitational instability ) , this minimal accretion rate is still larger than the @xmath240 obtained by @xcite from consideration of the masing disk .",
    "the minimum power in the jet in also constrains the mass accretion rate , provided the jet power is derived from the accretion flow and not from the spin of the black hole . the resulting estimate for @xmath224 ( cf .",
    "equation [ [ jetmdot ] ] ) is similar to that obtained by fitting the infrared spectrum .",
    "the limit on the 22 ghz radio flux in constrains the transition radius in any adaf to less than 100 schwarzschild radii , as emphasized by @xcite .",
    "as we show in this paper , the flux limit also constrains corona models .",
    "if the observed x - ray emission in is from a corona , then the corona must be primarily thermal rather than non - thermal , since otherwise it would produce more radio flux than observed .",
    "this limits the kinds of relativistic acceleration one can invoke in the corona .",
    "new data at several different frequencies would give interesting information on the nature of the central accretion flow in ngc 4258 .",
    "the adaf model predicts a complete spectrum whose amplitude and slope can be compared with new data in the radio , millimeter , infrared , and x - ray ; the predicted values are given in  4 .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to know if the near infrared flux is reprocessed or not .",
    "this can be tested by looking for variation on a timescale @xmath241 , which is about a week .",
    "since the viscous timescale indeed , even the dynamical timescale is much longer than this in the disk at @xmath242 , we would not expect significant variation in this component of the flux unless the infrared flux is reprocessed , or the infrared flux is produced nonthermally . if a significant fraction of the h and k band flux is reprocessed , this would rule out our simplest models and we would be forced to invoke a warped disk , wind , or other arrangement of reprocessing gas .",
    "higher angular resolution mid - infrared data would also be interesting , since a flat disk predicts a steeper spectrum in the mid - infrared than a warped , reprocessing disk .",
    "finally vlbi observations at lower frequencies than @xmath60 may tighten the general constraints on relativistic particle acceleration close to the black hole and exclude free - free absorption as a factor .",
    "they may also be able to determine the onset of self - absorption in the jet and thence provide a stronger constraint on the pressure and jet power by allowing us to solve for the magnetic field strength .",
    "further monitoring of the variability in both the northern and the southern component may also help determine the jet speed and elucidate the relationship between the jets and gas flow within @xmath243 gravitational radii of the central black hole ."
