    "the majority of the information that we have obtained during the last years about the magnetism of the sun and other astrophysical objects is based on the analysis of the polarization of the light .",
    "the polarization state of a light beam is typically described , using the stokes formalism , by the so - called stokes vector : @xmath0 where @xmath1 refers to the total intensity of the beam , @xmath2 describes its circular polarization properties while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are used to described linear polarization .",
    "when the light beam passes through optical elements or , in general , any medium that modifies its polarization properties , the emergent stokes vector can be related to the input one by the following linear relation : @xmath5 the @xmath6 matrix , @xmath7 , is the so - called mueller matrix and it can be used to unambiguously represent any optically passive medium .",
    "it is important to note that these matrices have to obey certain properties so that they have physical meaning @xcite .",
    "the analysis of polarization of a given beam is usually carried out with the aid of modulation schemes .",
    "this is a requisite in the short - wavelength ( optical ) domain because no detectors that present the required polarization sensitivity are still available .",
    "furthermore , the majority of the detectors that are used in the optical are only sensitive to the total amount of light or , in other words , to the total intensity given by stokes @xmath1 .",
    "this is not the case in the long - wavelength ( microwave ) domain , where it is relatively easy to build detectors that analyze directly the polarization properties of the light beam .",
    "modulation schemes have been built to overcome the difficulties when measuring the polarization state of light beams in the short - wavelength domain .",
    "any modulation scheme consists of a train of optical devices that produce a known modification of the input beam so that the observed intensity in the detector is a linear combination of the elements of the input stokes vector .",
    "carrying out several of these measurements , each one with a different combination of optical devices , it is possible to _ infer _ the input stokes vector using a demodulation procedure . assuming that the mueller matrix of the @xmath8-th combination of optical devices is given by @xmath9 , the detected intensity in each case is given by : @xmath10_{00}s^\\mathrm{in}_0+[m_j]_{01}s^\\mathrm{in}_1+[m_j]_{02}s^\\mathrm{in}_2+[m_j]_{03}s^\\mathrm{in}_3,\\ ] ] where we have used the standard notation @xmath11 for the stokes vector , which will be used extensively in the rest of the paper . by putting several measurements together , the modulation scheme can be expressed as the following linear system : @xmath12 where each row of the matrix @xmath13 is built with the first rows of the different mueller matrices of the different combinations of optical elements used in the modulation scheme .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath13 has dimensions @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the number of measurements .",
    "note that , neither the vector @xmath16 is a stokes vector nor the matrix @xmath13 is a mueller matrix .",
    "the vector @xmath16 consists of different intensity measurements , while the matrix @xmath13 does not fulfill , in general , the conditions described by @xcite and @xcite to be considered a mueller matrix .",
    "several different modulation techniques have been developed .",
    "one of the most widespread methods is to use a temporal modulation with a quarter - wave plate and a linear polarizer , with the fast axis of the quarter - wave plate being set to preselected angles @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the different polarizations states are observed on the same pixel . however , modulation has to be carried out very fast in order not to be limited by atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "another possibility is to use spatial modulation in which the measurements are carried out simultaneously by using a beamsplitter instead of a linear polarizer @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that atmospheric fluctuations are avoided but potential problems appear because the optical path and the detector response are not the same for all the polarization states .",
    "the most advanced polarimeters now use a combination of both approaches in the so - called spatio - temporal modulation @xcite .    starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : modulation ] ) , the input stokes vector can be obtained by solving the previous linear system of equations , so that : @xmath17 where the matrix @xmath18 is the inverse ( or moore - penrose pseudoinverse in the general case that more than four measurements are carried out to infer the input stokes vector ) of the matrix @xmath13 and has dimensions @xmath19 . in order to measure the four stokes parameters ,",
    "the minimum number of measurements is 4 .",
    "in such a case , the matrix @xmath18 is unique and can be calculated as the standard inverse of @xmath13 . however , it is also possible to carry out more measurements than stokes parameters . in this case , the linear system of eq .",
    "( [ eq : modulation ] ) is overdetermined and , in general , no solution that satisfies simultaneously all the equations exist .",
    "recently , it has been shown that it is still possible to choose a solution if we seek for the one that maximizes the efficiency of the modulation - demodulation scheme @xcite .",
    "such efficiency for each stokes parameter , represented with the vector , is obtained from the demodulation matrix @xcite : @xmath20 in this case , it can be shown that the optimal demodulation matrix is given by the moore - penrose pseudoinverse @xcite : @xmath21 the pseudoinverse can also be found with the singular value decomposition of the modulation matrix . note that",
    ", while @xmath22 in the general case , @xmath23 is only valid when @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the identity matrix ) .",
    "we present a theoretical calculation of how the error propagates in the demodulation process .",
    "this is an important issue that has been partially treated in the past , either considering how the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath16 propagates to the demodulated stokes vector when the modulation matrix is perfectly known @xcite or taking into account uncertainties in the knowledge of the modulation matrix , though the full covariance matrix is not obtained @xcite .",
    "many papers also deal with how error is propagated in non - ideal mueller matrix polarimeters @xcite while others consider the optimization of such polarimeters @xcite .",
    "in practical situations , the modulation matrix has to be measured once the optics and the modulation scheme have been defined @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects the elements of the modulation matrix to have some uncertainty produced by the measurement procedure .",
    "additionally , uncertainties can also be found when the rotation of the fast axis of the retarders or of the linear polarizers has some repeatability problems @xcite . in this case , although the average modulation matrix can be known with great precision , random deviations from the average modulation matrix can occur .",
    "these random deviations induce a modification on the modulation scheme that directly affects the inferred polarization properties of the input light beam . for these reasons ,",
    "it is fundamental to characterize the error propagation through the demodulation process and how they affect the measured stokes profiles . in general , since the matrix inversion ( or pseudoinverse ) is a nonlinear process , one should expect to find a full covariance matrix for the elements of the matrix @xmath18 , with non - zero non - diagonal elements .",
    "these non - diagonal elements account for the statistical correlations that appear between elements of the demodulation matrix after the inversion process .",
    "more importantly , a full covariance matrix has to be expected even in the case that the elements of the modulation matrix are not correlated ( i.e. , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the kronecker delta ) .",
    "note that a diagonal covariance matrix for the matrix @xmath13 comes out when the measurements of the elements of the modulation matrix are statistically independent , something that can be assumed in some cases if the measurements of the elements of the matrix are carried out with proper calibration .",
    "however , this is an issue that has to be carefully analyzed for each case .",
    "the full covariance matrix for the demodulation matrix can be obtained analytically following the standard error propagation formulae .",
    "the starting point is to consider that elements of the demodulation matrix are known nonlinear functions of the elements of the modulation matrix : @xmath28 the most general error propagation formula for such operation reads @xcite : @xmath29 this covariance matrix gives information about the variances of the elements of the demodulation matrix ( diagonal elements ) , as well as covariances between those elements ( non - diagonal elements ) .",
    "note that , for a @xmath19 matrix , the covariance matrix is @xmath30 . if the covariance matrix of the modulation matrix is diagonal ( i.e. , @xmath31 , with @xmath27 the kronecker delta ) , the previous equation simplifies to : @xmath32 as already presented above , this turns out to be a good approximation if the elements of the modulation matrix are carefully measured .",
    "however , our approach is general and can cope with non - diagonal covariance matrices as will be shown below .",
    "the derivatives that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : covarianced_general ] ) and ( [ eq : covarianced_diagonal ] ) can be calculated , in the most general case , starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : optimal_demodulation ] ) .",
    "however , we distinguish the cases of a square modulation matrix from the general case , because the analytical procedure can be largely simplified . in any case",
    ", we will show that the general expressions are equivalent to those of the particular case of a square matrix @xmath13 .",
    "although it is possible to calculate directly the derivatives from eq .",
    "( [ eq : optimal_demodulation ] ) , it is more advantageous to use the fact that the matrix product between @xmath13 and @xmath18 commute , so that @xmath33 . in this case , it is easy to show that @xcite : @xmath34 therefore , the full covariance matrix of the matrix elements of the demodulation matrix can be calculated by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : derivative_square ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : covarianced_general ] ) : @xmath35 in the particular case of a diagonal covariance matrix for @xmath13 , the previous equation simplifies to : @xmath36      when @xmath15 is larger than four , it is not possible to follow the previous approach because @xmath13 and @xmath18 do not commute .",
    "however , inserting the intermediate matrix @xmath37 , using the fact that @xmath38 and that the matrix @xmath39 is always invertible @xcite , the derivative can be expressed , after some algebra , as : @xmath40 the derivative of the elements of the @xmath41 matrix with respect to the elements of @xmath13 can be calculated using the chain rule : @xmath42 the definition of the matrix @xmath39 allows us to obtain the following derivative easily : @xmath43 the derivative of the elements of @xmath41 with respect to the elements of @xmath13 can also be calculated easily from eq .",
    "( [ eq : derivative_square ] ) because @xmath39 is a square matrix , that commutes with its inverse .",
    "therefore : @xmath44 substituting eq .",

    "( [ eq : derivative_square ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : demodulation ] ) , the covariance matrix can be written as : @xmath48 the first contribution takes into account the uncertainty in the knowledge of the modulation matrix while the second contribution takes into account the uncertainty in the measurement of the intensities arriving to the detector @xcite . in the field of optimization of polarimeters , a suitable norm of this very last term ( often neglecting the non - diagonal covariances in the vector @xmath49 that we include here ) is the chosen one to measure the efficiency of a polarimeter @xcite .",
    "particularizing to our problem and calculating the partial derivatives , we end up with : @xmath50 the covariance matrix @xmath51 is typically assumed to be diagonal , since no statistical dependence is assumed between consecutive intensity measurements in the detector , so that @xmath52 .",
    "since this is not generally the case for the quantities @xmath53 , a non - zero ( in general ) covariance between different stokes profiles appears as a consequence of some degree of correlation in the demodulation process .    in principle , it is possible to diagonalize the covariance matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : covariance_intensity ] ) to obtain its principal components .",
    "such principal components define the directions along which the correlation between different stokes parameters is minimized . since the principal components define a new reference system , it is possible to rotate the original reference system in which the four - dimensional stokes vector is defined .",
    "this rotation minimizes in a statistical sense the cross - talk .",
    "this could be of interest when synthetic calculations have to be compared with polarimetric observations . in this case , in order to minimize the effect of cross - talk , it could be advantageous to compare the observations with projections along the eigenvectors of the synthetic calculations .",
    "a quantity that is also affected by uncertainties in the knowledge of @xmath13 is the efficiency defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efficiency ] ) . applying the error propagation formula ,",
    "we get : @xmath54 if we assume that the covariance matrix of the elements of the modulation matrix is diagonal , we get : @xmath55 the derivatives can be calculated using the definition of the efficiency and the chain rule : @xmath56 where @xmath57 plugging this expression into eq .",
    "( [ eq : derivative_epsilon ] ) , we can simplify it to read : @xmath58 the derivative @xmath59 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : derivative_nonsquare ] ) in the general case and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : derivative_square ] ) in the case of a square modulation matrix .",
    "according to the previous results , when the covariance matrix of the modulation matrix is diagonal and the variance is the same for all the elements , all the covariance matrices calculated in this section are proportional to the variance of the elements of @xmath13 . as a consequence ,",
    "reducing an order of magnitude the uncertainty in the elements of the modulation matrix reduces an order of magnitude the uncertainty in the demodulation matrix and in the inferred stokes vector .",
    "the previous analytical approach assumes that the error propagates normally .",
    "this is typically a good approximation when the modulation matrix is far from singular . in other words ,",
    "the rows of the modulation matrix have to be as linearly independent as possible .",
    "however , since the inversion is a nonlinear process , it would be possible to obtain distributions in the demodulation matrix ( and as a consequence , in the inferred stokes parameters ) that are far from gaussians .",
    "in order to verify this issue and also to test that the previous analytical approach gives the correct answer , we have carried out a monte carlo experiment . for simplicity , we assume that the measurement uncertainty is the same for all the matrix elements of the modulation matrix and that it is characterized by the variance @xmath60 , so that the full variance matrix is given by : @xmath61 this selection makes the presentation of the results easier , but the previous approach is general and can cope with non - diagonal covariance matrices .",

    "( [ eq : optimal_demodulation ] ) .",

    "the previous analytical approach is applied to several modulation matrices obtained from the literature and that represent different typical modulation schemes .",
    "we analyze the uncertainties in the demodulation matrix and in the inferred stokes parameters using the error propagation formulation presented in the previous section . for illustration purposes ,",
    "the results are also accompanied in some cases with plots obtained using the monte carlo approach .",
    "one of the reasons for that is to demonstrate whether the resulting distributions can be correctly assumed to be gaussians .",
    "the monte carlo results have been obtained using @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that the variance that characterizes the uncertainty in the measurement of the modulation matrix is @xmath68 ( the standard deviation is equal to @xmath69 ) , which is a reasonable value for a standard calibration of the modulation .",

    "for instance , the value @xmath79 indicates that when the inferred stokes @xmath1 ( @xmath80 ) increases , the inferred stokes @xmath2 ( @xmath81 ) tends to systematically decrease .",

    "they are simple to calculate and require only the knowledge of the modulation matrix , together with its covariance matrix .",
    "we have pointed out the fact that , in general , since matrix inversion ( or moore - penrose pseudoinversion ) is a nonlinear operation , non - zero non - diagonal covariances have to be expected in the demodulation matrix even if such non - diagonal correlations are not present in the modulation matrix .",
