    "localization is one of the key phenomena in nature .",
    "it was extensively explored in a wide range of systems including localization of electrons in disordered systems , localization of phonons , and many others @xcite .",
    "recently it attracted much attention in application to epidemic spreading @xcite , where localization means persistence of an island of disease below the epidemic threshold around a strongly connected node or a dense cluster in a network .",
    "the complication is that the sis ( susceptible - infective - susceptible ) epidemic model has an absorbing state in which infection is absent @xcite , and so below the epidemic threshold islands of disease with a finite number of infective nodes can not survive forever . in other words ,",
    "a system with a finite number of infected nodes has a non - zero probability to recover immediately . for a large but finite number of infected nodes",
    ", however , this probability is small , so the complete recovery can take a long time . for finite fully connected graphs ,",
    "this behavior was described in ref .",
    "consequently , in the heterogeneous sis model , localization should be only metastable @xcite , manifesting itself in the form of long - lasting local outbreaks of the disease below the epidemic threshold .",
    "in this paper we consider the sis model on a random regular graph with a single hub ( `` spreader center '' ) and investigate the metastable nature of localization of a disease . on a regular network ,",
    "the sis model is equivalent to the ordinary contact process @xcite that belongs to the directed percolation universality class @xcite .",
    "these processes can be solved exactly only on fully connected graphs , so we have to resort to extensive numerical simulations .",
    "on the other hand , the heterogeneous ( annealed ) @xcite and quenched @xcite mean - field approaches do not take into account the fluctuations and the absorbing state in the sis model , so they can not provide even a qualitative description of metastable localization . in the present paper",
    "we show how the effect of this localization can be detected by analyzing the shape of the distribution of the number of infected nodes in the metastable state . by metastable state we mean the active quasistationary state below the epidemic threshold .",
    "measuring the lifetime of the localized states we describe how the metastable localization depends on the epidemic parameter @xmath0 . from the distribution of the number of infective nodes in finite graphs we extract the contribution of the metastable localized states and compare it with the solution of the sis model on a star graph , uncovering the effect of the network substrate .",
    "we observe two regimes , localized and delocalized , separated by a smooth crossover occurring in a region around @xmath1 .",
    "surprisingly , in contrast to predictions of the quenched mean - field theory , the disease is localized on a hub below the crossover region , and between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the effect of hub disappears .",
    "we study the sis model on a random regular graph of @xmath4 nodes , with all but one having degree @xmath5 .",
    "the single hub in this graph is a node with @xmath6 connections . for the sake of comparison",
    "we also consider the same network without hub ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the graph has finite length loops ( cycles ) only when @xmath4 is finite .    in the sis model",
    ", each node can be in two states : susceptible and infective .",
    "a susceptible node is infected by each of its infective nearest neighbors with rate @xmath0 ( so - called effective spreading rate ) , which is the control parameter in this model .",
    "an infective node spontaneously recovers with unit rate .",
    "our simulations for uniform networks up to @xmath8 nodes confirmed that in the infinite random regular graph with the coordination number @xmath9 , the epidemic threshold is @xmath10 ref .",
    "this is the usual continuous transition in the contact process above the upper critical dimension @xcite .",

    "we trace the numbers of infective nodes , @xmath11 , and of active links , @xmath12 . by definition ,",

    "\\(2 ) to access the quasistationary state we have to wait a long time after the start of the process .",
    "it is very likely that the system falls into the absorbing state during the transient period , and we would have to restart the process many times before one realization lasts enough to reach the quasistationary state . below the epidemic threshold , this is a quite inefficient approach because most of the computation time is spent simulating the transient and not the quasistationary state .    to overcome this difficulty we use the quasistationary method @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "when the system falls in the absorbing state , we restart it from an active configuration taken at random from the history of active configurations visited by the process . for this",
    ", we keep a database of a large number of active configurations , where , at random instants , we save the current configuration in a random position of the database . as the process proceeds ,",
    "the database is repeatedly updated and relaxes until the process converges to a stationary state that is independent of the initial conditions . in the limits of large number of states in the database and long times intervals between consecutive updates , the stationary states of the quasistationary method",
    "converges to the one of the original process .",
    "these two limits are important .",
    "they ensure that the configurations in the database are uncorrelated .",
    "the quasistationary method can be viewed as a clever way of simulating the whole ensemble of realizations of the process while collecting data from a single realization .",
    "the advantage is that when the observed realization falls in the absorbing state we choose another at random , among the ones still active , and start collecting data from that moment forward .",
    "after the initial relaxation period of the history database we collect data without interruptions , dramatically reducing the computation time needed for gathering a representative statistics .",

    "[ fig : ff1 ] we measure localized activity over @xmath94 orders of magnitude of system size ( from @xmath95 nodes to @xmath33 ) .",
    "we maximize the difference between curves for different @xmath4 by selecting @xmath96 . recall that at @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 . for @xmath99",
    "the fraction of localized configurations in the history database is already small , roughly @xmath100 .",
    "because of this smallness we keep a database large enough that the average number of localized configurations stored there is much larger than its fluctuations . for these simulations",
    "we keep a database of @xmath101 configurations .",
    "this number of configurations allows us to have on average about @xmath102 localized configurations in the networks of @xmath33 nodes . at each time step",
    "we update a random position of the database with the current configuration with probability @xmath103 , where @xmath104 $ ] is the lifetime of the configuration ( see main text ) . with this update probability",
    "the average time interval between consecutive updates is of roughly @xmath105 . by comparing simulations with different update intervals we found that , in all of the cases considered , the results for an average update interval of @xmath105 are indistinguishable from those obtained with longer update intervals .",
    "we only start to collect data after each position of the database has been updated at least @xmath106 times , allowing for the full relaxation of the history record .",
    "\\(4 ) in the quasistationary state , the rate at which the system falls in the absorbing configuration is @xmath107 . in the sis model",
    ", this rate must be exactly equal to the probability of the active system having only one infective node , @xmath36 , multiplied by the rate at which the infective node spontaneously recovers , which is @xmath70 in this case @xcite . then to check if the resulting stationary data are correct ( e.g. , not spoiled by errors in the code ) , it is useful to compare @xmath28 and @xmath108 .",
    "these two numbers must be equal with a high precision increasing with the collected amount of data . in our simulations",
    "we verify this equality with up to 7 digits of precision .",
    "note that for @xmath109 to hold we must measure time as a continuous variable , incrementing it by @xmath104 $ ] at each step , and define @xmath34 as the fraction of the total time that the system spends in configurations with @xmath35 active nodes .",
