    "various attempts have been made to account for thermodynamical behavior of quantum systems @xcite . especially the relaxation into an equilibrium state in a pure quantum world does not seem to be feasible since schrdinger dynamics is reversible like the classical hamiltonian dynamics . by introducing irreversibility into quantum mechanics one thus has to face all the old difficulties .",
    "one quite successful way to introduce relaxation behavior into quantum mechanical models is to consider open systems modeled by a quantum master equation @xcite or the lindblad formalism @xcite . in these approaches",
    "the influence of the environmental system enters the liouville - von - neumann equation for the considered system via incoherent damping terms . to deduce such a closed evolution equation several approximations are necessary , e.g. , the born - markov assumption .    in the context of quantum thermodynamics",
    "has recently been found irreversible behavior in classes of very small bipartite quantum systems described by a pure schrdinger evolution only @xcite .",
    "this approach does not need those specific assumptions about the environment .",
    "instead , system and environment are treated as a whole . even in a small bipartite systems , consisting of a two level system ( `` gas system '' )",
    "coupled to an environment ( `` container '' ) of no more than some hundred levels thermodynamical behavior is generic  relaxation occurs to a theoretically predicted equilibrium state ( see @xcite ) .    in the above mentioned scenarios",
    "the gas system has been very small ( from two to five levels ) and coupled to an environment without any structure or selectivity . in a more complex situation",
    "the system under consideration ( gas system ) could be constructed from several identical subsystems , e.g.  the system could be a spin chain .",
    "for such bipartite systems with increased internal complexity the effect of the coupling topology is not yet completely understood : if we couple a chain of identical subsystems at one edge only to a quantum environment as before , the question arises whether the whole system will still relax into a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "furthermore , we are interested in whether and when the individual subsystems are also in a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "according to recent investigations on local temperature of modular systems @xcite , we expect the same global as well as local temperature in the system for weakly coupled chains . in cases of a stronger coupling this may no longer be the case ( as shown by an open system approach @xcite ) .    those chain systems coupled to a quantum environment will be treated as a closed system subject to schrdinger dynamics and will be compared to the modeling via a quantum master equation . in particular",
    ", we will analyze chains with different coupling types and strengths with respect to their local as well as global thermal or non - thermal properties .",
    "we consider chains of three identical quantum systems described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 here the first sum contains the local hamilton operators @xmath3 of site . in our case",
    "the local hamiltonian of site @xmath4 reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the pauli spin operator . here and in the following all energies",
    "are taken in units of the zeeman splitting .",
    "the second sum refers to the next neighbor couplings between the subsystems normalized by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hilbert space dimension of the chain .",
    "thus , it is possible to control the internal coupling strength by the single parameter @xmath9 ( see ( [ eq : m1 ] ) ) only , irrespective of the type of coupling . in the following we compare two different interactions  a random coupling @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are normally distributed random numbers in the interval @xmath12 $ ] , and a heisenberg interaction , @xmath13      [ ] [ ] environment coupling topology of the spin chain to the quantum environment.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the model system described in the last section , is now coupled to an adequate environment : @xmath14 the first term is the hamiltonian of the chain , @xmath15 refers to the hamiltonian of the environment and @xmath16 is the interaction between system and environment . after normalizing @xmath17 via @xmath18 ( compare ( [ eq:5 ] ) ) the external coupling strength",
    "is controlled by the parameter @xmath19 only .",
    "this system environment coupling is taken to be small in all cases as a precondition to allow for thermodynamic behavior .",
    "the interaction will be chosen in such a way that it couples only to one boundary of the system ( see fig . [",
    "fig : system - bad ] ) , say to the third spin of the chain .",
    "furthermore , the interaction should allow for energy exchange between system and environment .",
    "in the following we will consider both , a complete solution of the schrdinger equation for system and environment according to @xmath20 as well as a quantum master equation , simulating a corresponding bath coupling .",
    "let us start with the complete model under schrdinger dynamics . at first sight",
    "it may not seem clear how a totally time reversible equation like the schrdinger equation could produce something like irreversible behavior . to clarify this point",
    "we introduce some aspects of quantum thermodynamics .",
    "a complete derivation of all aspects of this theory is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "therefore we only sum up some central aspects of this approach and refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "according to quantum thermodynamics ( see @xcite ) , the system proper relaxes to a gibbsian state whenever the density of states of the environment is an exponential function of energy ; the latter is typical for many body systems .",
    "we model such a quantum environment here by a system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system - bad ] , the width of the energy levels should indicate the degeneracy ) of the eight energy levels @xmath21 with degeneracies given by @xmath22 this may seem rather artificial , but the idea is as follows : the environment may possess a continuous spectrum , but due to the weak coupling between s and e the system only couples to the resonant levels .",
    "thus we can neglect all the other levels .",
    "this environment is then expected to induce on the spin - chain a canonical state with the reciprocal temperature @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the boltzmann - constant . with the special degeneracy structure ( [ eq:7 ] ) this leads to @xmath26 .    for a numerical test and to avoid any bias",
    "we pick for @xmath17 a hermitian random matrix from an ensemble with the distribution @xcite",
    "@xmath27    _ theoretical predictions : _ in contrast to the master equation approach , the dynamics of the closed system ( spin chain and environment ) is purely schrdinger - type .",
    "the von neumann entropy of the completely closed system thus remains constant .",
    "but by splitting up the whole system into two parts , a small system taken to be the spin - chain and a large one , the environment , the von neumann entropy of the parts can change in time . as a matter of fact",
    ", the small system shows a thermodynamical behavior if two restrictions are met :    * the coupling between the small system and the environment should be small , i.e.  the energy contained in the interaction has to be much smaller than the local energies , @xmath28 which guarantees that the spectrum of the environment is not disturbed too much . * the hilbert space of the environment should be very large compared to the hilbert space of the small system .",
    "conversely , all systems meeting these conditions may be called thermodynamical .",
    "the concrete form of the interaction defines an accessible region within the whole hilbert space , selected by the initial state . using a model with full energy exchange between system and environment ( canonical situation )",
    "only one supplementary condition remains active , the overall energy conservation defining the accessible region . by a topological investigation of the hilbert space ( see @xcite ) , the details of which are beyond the scope of this article , it is possible to show that the state of the complete system will enter a very large region ( the dominant region ) within the accessible region , for which the system under consideration is in a state with approximately maximum von  neumann entropy .",
    "the respective energy distribution of the small system in this dominant region , i.e.  the probability to find the small system in an energy eigenstate @xmath29 ( no degeneracy ) for an initial state with a sharp energy is then given by @xmath30 ( for a complete derivation of ( [ eq:18 ] ) see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath29 is the i - th energy level of the spin system , @xmath31 the corresponding energy level in the environment with the degeneracy @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the total number of levels in the environment .",
    "master equation approaches describe the dynamics of open systems .",
    "they have been widely applied to describe system bath models , in particular in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "their derivation is standard and can be found in several textbooks .",
    "however , since our system , the spin chain , has an internal structure and since only one of the boundary spins directly couples to the bath , special care must be taken :    the entire dynamics of the system coupled to the bath is given by the liouville - von - neumann equation , from which the nakajima - zwanzig equation can be derived @xcite .",
    "assuming that the bath is in a thermal state , @xmath34 an expansion of the latter up to second order in the system bath coupling reads : @xmath35 } - \\int_0^t dt ' \\ , \\text{tr}_{\\text { e } } { \\left [    \\hat{i}_{\\text{se}},{\\left [ \\hat{i}_\\text{se } ( t'-t),\\rho_{\\text s } \\otimes \\rho_{\\text e}\\right]}\\right]}\\ , ,                                 \\ ] ] where @xmath36 the reduced density matrix of the spin - system and @xmath37 , the system bath interaction in the interaction picture reads , @xmath38 the time dependence of which can be computed in the eigenbasis of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . applying , as usual ,",
    "the markov approximation , the integral of ( [ eq:23 ] ) can be computed and the following form of the damping rates is found :    @xmath41}+ ( { \\hat{a } } { \\hat{\\gamma}}^a \\rho_\\text s)-({\\hat{\\gamma}}^a \\rho_\\text s { \\hat{a}})+(\\rho_\\text s { \\hat{\\gamma}}^b { \\hat{a}})-({\\hat{a } } \\rho_\\text s { \\hat{\\gamma}}^b)\\ , , \\label{eq:11}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 as can be seen the environment has been locally coupled to spin  3 only .    denoting the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spin - system by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively @xmath45 and defining @xmath46 , the transition matrices @xmath47",
    "have the following matrix representation in the eigenbasis of @xmath48 : @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 note that by virtue of ( [ eq:41 ] ) the real damping rates of ( [ eq:12 ] ) - ( [ eq:15 ] ) only appear if the transition matrices @xmath47 are represented in the eigenbasis of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , simply writing down lindblad damping terms @xcite for spin  3 , the one which directly couples to the bath , would in general , lead to wrong results @xcite .",
    "however , if the coupling between the spins in the chain is small enough , additional approximations can be made and one will obtain the lindblad type damping rates for spin  3 @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned , that the thermal state @xmath54 is the stationary and therefore asymptotic solution of ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "we will use as a measure to characterize the asymptotic state of the spin system and the single spins a `` spectral - temperature '' defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the probability to find the system at the @xmath8-th energy level @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the highest and @xmath59 the lowest energy level .",
    "the main idea here is to assign a boltzmann factor to each pair of neighboring energy levels .",
    "the spectral - temperature then simply is the average over all these factors weighed by the corresponding occupation probabilities .",
    "this spectral - temperature also exists in non - equilibrium situations but coincides with the standard definition of temperature ( e.  g.  @xcite ) only for a canonical state .    for the calculation of the spectral - temperatures according to ( [ eq:21 ] ) we insert for @xmath56 the long time average @xmath60 of the respective occupation probability .      to demonstrate the relaxation behavior of the spin - chain under schrdinger dynamics we have diagonalized the total hamiltonian @xmath61 ( see ( [ eq:6 ] ) ) and solved the exact schrdinger equation @xmath62",
    "the initial state @xmath63 has been taken as a product state of the spin chain and the environment . from the density matrix @xmath64 we trace out the environment and transform",
    "the resulting reduced density matrix into the eigenbasis of the spin - system .",

    "the horizontal lines are the expected probabilities from ( [ eq:18 ] ) to find the system at the corresponding energies .",
    "these are in good accordance with the time - averaged values of @xmath70 . @xmath9 and @xmath19 are energies taken in units of the zeeman splitting .",

    "both evolutions have been obtained with the coupling parameters @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "the horizontal lines are the probabilities as expected from ( [ eq:18 ] ) .",
    "as can be seen , for both internal couplings , the spin - system relaxes into a state which is in accordance with ( [ eq:18 ] ) .",
    "the probability fluctuations can be interpreted as a finite size effect of the environment .    _",
    "global and local temperatures : _ now that we have demonstrated the relaxation of the spin - chain into a thermal equilibrium state , we want to analyze the relaxation behavior of the spin - chain depending on the internal interaction strength @xmath9 .",
    "the approach of [ sec : level23 ] is independent of the internal structure of the small system .",
    "thus the relaxation behavior should be independent of @xmath9 and the temperature of the spin - chain should be identical to that induced by the environment @xmath72 ( see ( [ eq:7 ] ) ) .",
    "to specify the temperature of the spin - chain @xmath73 we use the `` spectral - temperature '' defined in ( [ eq:21 ] ) .",
    "we compare the spectral - temperature of the total spin - chain to those of each individual spin . for the local spectral - temperature @xmath74 of a single spin , ( [ eq:21 ] )",

    "however , the spectral - temperatures of each single spin is found to increase with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the local spin - system is disturbed more and more with increasing @xmath9 although the whole spin - system continues to reach a canonical state @xcite .    especially for a heisenberg coupled spin chain",

    "temporal fluctuations persist , though , and are a result of the still comparatively small environment .",
    "the spin chain always reaches the predicted state independently of the internal coupling type and strength .",
    "thus we can conclude , that the internal structure of a small system as well as locality of the coupling to a quantum environment does not effect the relaxation behavior .",
    "the results also show that the overall state reached is a canonical one and thus the spectral - temperature of the total spin chain can be identified as the `` real '' ( thermodynamic ) temperature of the system .",
    "on the other hand , the spectral - temperature of each individual spin does depend on the internal coupling strength , an effect which has been traced back to increased correlations of each spin with its neighbor(s ) .",
    "this causes an increase of the local entropy which mimics a higher spectral - temperature .",
    "so our conclusion is that for stronger internal couplings the local spin states are non - thermal states @xcite , indicating that the global temperature ceases to be available also locally .    for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain , we have found that single spins are approximately in thermal states up to coupling strengths @xmath100 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results in @xcite .",
