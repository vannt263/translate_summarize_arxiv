    "heavy ion collision experiments provide an opportunity to investigate particle properties in the medium .",
    "inspired by these experiments , there is an increasing interest to investigate the properties of hadronic matter under extreme condition @xcite,@xcite . in general , the media created by these collisions consist different mesons and baryons .",
    "investigation of hadronic properties at finite temperature and density directly using the fundamental thermal qcd lagrangian is highly desirable .",
    "however , such interactions occur in a region very far from the perturbative regime , where the quark - gluon coupling constant becomes large and the perturbative methods is not suitable for calculation of these properties .",
    "therefore , we need nonperturbative approaches .",
    "some nonperturbative approaches are lattice qcd , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , qcd sum rules , etc . among these approaches , the qcd sum rules method @xcite and its extension to finite temperature @xcite has been widely used as an efficient and applicable tool to investigate the hadronic properties @xcite .",
    "the main elements in qcd sum rules approach are correlation function and dispersion relation .",
    "the correlation function is an object with dual nature . at large negative @xmath1 ,",
    "it can be evaluated by perturbative methods , whereas at positive @xmath1 , it must be represented in terms of hadronic observables .",
    "dispersion relation allows us to link the thermal correlator for positive values of @xmath1 to the one for negative values .",
    "spectral functions in different cases were studied in the literature @xcite-@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the two - point thermal correlator using the real time formulation of the thermal field theory @xcite . we calculate the spectral densities of ( pseudo)scalar currents at finite temperature , which are necessary for the phenomenological investigation of ( pseudo)scalar mesons parameters .",
    "we use quark propagator at finite temperature and show how an additional branch cut corresponding to particle absorption from the medium arises in spectral density . we also compare our results with predictions obtained at zero temperature .",
    "we begin by considering the thermal correlation function , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the interpolating current that carries the quantum numbers of the state concerned and @xmath4 indicates the time ordered product . here",
    "@xmath5 or @xmath6 for scalar and pseudoscalar particles , respectively .",
    "the thermal average of the operator , @xmath7 , appearing in the above thermal correlator is expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the qcd hamiltonian , and @xmath10 stands for the inverse of the temperature .",
    "traces are carried out over any complete set of states . in the real time version ,",
    "thermal correlator has the form of a @xmath11 matrix .",
    "however , this matrix may be diagonalized , when it is expressed by a single analytic function , which determines completely the dynamics of the corresponding two - point function @xcite . as this function",
    "is simply related to any one , say the @xmath12-component of the matrix , we need to calculate only this component of the correlation function .",
    "the @xmath12-component of the thermal quark propagator is a sum of vacuum quark propagator expression and a term depending on the fermi distribution function , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath15^{-1}$ ] .",
    "now , we proceed to obtain the temperature - dependent dispersion relation . the time ordering product in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is step function .",
    "using kubo - martin - schwinger relation , @xmath18 for thermal expectation and making fourier and some other transformations , we get the following expression for the thermal correlation function in momentum space @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 in the above transformations , the following standard integral representation for the @xmath21- step function is used : @xmath22}{k_{0}-i\\varepsilon } . \\\\\\ ] ] the imaginary part of the correlation function can be simply evaluated using the formula @xmath23 , which leads to @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in some cases ,",
    "the correlation function has ultraviolet divergent . if the spectral density does not vanish at @xmath27 , the dispersion integral in eq .",
    "( 8) diverges . a standard way to overcome",
    "this problem is to subtract first few terms of its taylor expansion at @xmath28 from @xmath29 .",
    "the thermal correlation function in momentum space can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath5 and @xmath31 for scalar and pseudoscalar particles , respectively . inserting propagators from eq .",
    "( 3 ) in eq . ( 9 ) and carrying out the @xmath32 integration , we obtain the imaginary part of @xmath29 in the following form : @xmath33 \\nonumber\\\\&&+(\\omega_{1}^{2}-\\textbf{k}^{2}+\\textbf{k}\\cdot \\textbf{q}+\\omega_{1}q_{0}\\pm m_{1}m_{2 } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times [ ( 1-n_{1}-n_{2}+2n_{1}n_{2 } ) \\delta(q_{0}+\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2})-(n_{1}+n_{2}-2n_{1}n_{2})\\delta(q_{0}+\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2})]\\big { ] } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are quark masses , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the plus and minus signs in front of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , correspond to scalar and pseudoscalar particles , respectively .",
    "the term , which does not include the fermi distribution functions , show the vacuum contribution .",
    "terms including the fermi distributions depict medium contributions .",
    "the delta - functions in the different terms of eq .",
    "( 10 ) control the regions of non - vanishing imaginary parts of @xmath29 , which define the position of the branch cuts .",
    "as seen the term including @xmath40 gives contribution when @xmath41 .",
    "using cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath42 we see that , @xmath43 and for @xmath41 , we get , @xmath44 therefore , we obtain the first branch cut , @xmath45 , which coincides with zero temperature cut describing the standard threshold for particle decays .",
    "this term survives at zero temperature and it is called the annihilation term . on the other hand ,",
    "the term including @xmath46 gives contribution when @xmath47 .",
    "similarly to the above expression , we obtain , @xmath48 and therefore an additional branch cut arises at finite temperature , @xmath49 , which corresponds to particle absorption from the medium .",
    "it is called scattering term and vanishes at @xmath50 .    in the following ,",
    "we restrict our calculations with @xmath51 , when there is no angular dependence .",
    "note that , with @xmath51 , the value of @xmath52 , fixed by the @xmath53-functions in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , is the magnitude of three momentum of quark or antiquark in the center - of - mass of the quark - antiquark system : @xmath54 in the @xmath51 case , as it is seen , the terms including @xmath40 and @xmath55 functions in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , give contributions at the regions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively giving the vacuum cuts .",
    "similarly , the terms including @xmath46 and @xmath58 functions in eq . ( 10 ) , give contributions at in the regions , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively giving the landau cuts .",
    "after straightforward calculations , we find the vacuum part of the @xmath61 as : @xmath62 taking into account both branch cuts after some transformations , the annihilation and scattering parts of spectral density is found as : @xmath63 } , \\\\\\ ] ] for @xmath64 , @xmath65 } , \\\\\\ ] ] for @xmath66 , with @xmath67 . here",
    ", @xmath68 is the spectral density in the lowest order of perturbation theory at zero temperature and it is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 for scalar and pseudoscalar particles , respectively .",
    "as it is seen , at @xmath0 limit these expressions are in good consistency with the vacuum expressions . moreover , the obtained results are well consistent with the existing results in @xmath74 case @xcite-@xcite for the scalar and pseudoscalar particles .    as an example",
    ", we present the dependence of the annihilation and scattering parts of the spectral density for @xmath75 and @xmath76 particles in figs . 1 and 2 . in numerical analysis",
    ", we use the values @xmath77 gev and @xmath78 gev for the quark masses .",
    "as it is clear , in the region of the standard threshold for particle decays , the @xmath79 is replaced by the annihilation term . in the case of light mesons ,",
    "the values of @xmath80 considerably differ from those of the @xmath79 .",
    "however , in the case of heavy mesons , the @xmath80 and @xmath79 values are very close to each other . from fig . 1",
    ", we also see that the in light @xmath75 cases , the medium contributions play important role and consist higher percentage of the total value .    our concluding result is that the thermal contributions contribute significantly to the spectral function .",
