    "the origin of quasi - periodic - oscillation ( qpo ) and its properties are ill - understood phenomena in modern astrophysics . observed qpo frequencies from black hole , neutron star , as well as white dwarf systems range from milli hertz ( mhz ) to kilo hertz ( khz ) with varying properties . among them",
    "most interesting and puzzling qpos are the khz ones . to date",
    ", more than @xmath0 accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) have been found exhibiting such khz frequency qpos ( van der klis 2000 ; 2006 ) .",
    "several black holes have also been found exhibiting the high frequency ( hf ) qpos of a few hundreds of hz .",
    "the most puzzling cases are those when a pair of qpo forms , particularly in neutron star systems , and qpos in the pair appear to be separated in frequency either by the order of the spin frequency of the neutron star , apparently for _ slow rotators _ , or by half of the spin frequency , for _ fast rotators_. an example of the later cases is 4u  1636 - 53 with the spin frequency @xmath1 hz , while of the former ones is 4u  1702 - 429 with @xmath2 hz . moreover , in several occasions the frequency separation decreases with the increase of one of the qpo frequencies . in black hole binaries also the hf qpos have been found in pairs , but seem to appear at a @xmath3 ratio ( remillard et al .",
    "2002 ) that favors the idea of a resonance mechanism behind their origin .",
    "the examples are gro  j1655 - 40 , xte  j1550 - 564 , grs  1915 + 105 which exhibit the hf qpos",
    ". the difference of the twin hf / khz ( van der klis 2005 ) qpos between black holes and neutron stars might be due to presence of a rotating magnetosphere in the later cases imprinting directly the spin frequency on the oscillations of the disk .",
    "however , sometimes qpos from neutron stars , e.g. sco  x-1 , also seem to appear at a @xmath3 ratio ( abramowicz et al .",
    "2003 ) .    magnetically driven",
    "warping and precession instability are expected to occur in the inner region of an accretion disk ( lai 1999 ) by interaction between the surface current density in the disk and the stellar magnetic field .",
    "this produces motions at low frequencies , much lower than the orbital frequency accounting for the low frequency qpos .",
    "this is similar to the lense - thirring precession shown by stella & vietri ( 1998 ) .",
    "the mhz qpos in some systems can be explained with magnetic warping process for strongly magnetized neutron stars ( shirakawa & lai 2002 ) .",
    "titarchuk ( 2003 ) , on the other hand , described qpo by the rayleigh - taylor instability associated with rossby waves and rotational splitting .",
    "the effect of nonlinear coupling between g - mode oscillations in a thin relativistic disk and warp was examined by kato ( 2004 ) for a static compact object .",
    "a strong correlation between low and high frequency qpos has been found by recent observations ( psaltis , belloni & van der klis 1999 ; mauche 2002 ; belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ) of accretion disks around compact objects .",
    "holding the relation over mhz to khz range strongly supports the idea that qpos are universal physical processes , independent of the nature of the compact object . observing universal nature between the hf / khz qpos in black holes and neutron stars , mcclintock & remillard ( 2004 )",
    "suggested that they are due to the orbital motion of the accreting matter near the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "titarchuk & wood ( 2002 ) explained the correlation in terms of a centrifugal barrier model ( see also titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , earlier by numerical simulation , molteni , sponholz & chakrabarti ( 1996 ) showed qpo in the black hole accretion disks from the shock oscillation induced by the strong centrifugal barrier .",
    "later , chakrabarti & manickam ( 2000 ) verified this analyzing observational data .    in early , it has been shown that qpos may arise from nonlinear resonance phenomena in an accretion disk placed in strong gravity ( e.g. kluzniak et al . 2004",
    "; petri 2005 ; blaes et al .",
    "this is particularly suggestive because of their variation in frequency , while we know that the varying frequency in a characteristic range is a well studied feature of nonlinear oscillators .",
    "indeed accretion dynamics and the disk structure are determined by the nonlinear hydrodynamic / magnetohydrodynamic equations with the effective gravitational potential which is not harmonic .",
    "therefore , a nonlinear response is expected .",
    "the above authors argued for the resonance between epicyclic motions of accreting matter around a rotating compact object resulting qpos , particularly the hf / khz ones .",
    "however , the separation between vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies as a function of radial coordinate increases mostly with the increase of either of the frequencies .",
    "although the separation of qpo frequencies in a pair observed from xte  j1807 - 294 appears constant ( linares et al . 2005 ) and from aql  x-1 seems increasing ( barret , boutelier & miller 2008 ) with the increase of either of the frequencies , in most of the cases it is opposite ( modeled by stella & vietri 1999 ; karas 1999 ) which contradicts the model based on the resonance between epicyclic motions . at radii smaller than the radius showing peak of radial epicyclic frequency , while the separation decreases with the increase of radial epicyclic frequency , the frequency separation is too large , much larger than the spin frequency of the star .",
    "indeed , based on cir  x-1 data , belloni , mndez & homan ( 2007 ) argued against the model .",
    "therefore , one has to invoke new physics to describe multiple qpo features .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose a _ global _ resonance model based on higher order nonlinearity to describe black hole and",
    "neutron star qpos together .",
    "the model successfully describes important features including variation of the qpo frequency separation in a pair as a function of qpo frequency itself . on the mission of reproducing observed qpos , the model predicts the spin parameter ( specific angular momentum or the kerr parameter ) of black holes as well as the spin frequency of a neutron star .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we establish the model describing the underlying physics briefly . in  3 and",
    " 4 we reproduce various properties of observed khz / hf qpos from six neutron stars and four black holes respectively , minimizing free parameters .",
    "finally , we end with a summary in  5 .",
    "wagoner ( 1999 ) and kato ( 2004 ) investigated small oscillations of geometrically thin accretion disks around a rotating compact object in the linear regime in the context of qpo .",
    "later , rezzolla et al . ( 2003 ) studied the radial oscillations of twodimensional accretion tori in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "kluzniak et al .",
    "( 2004 ) investigated the response to a transient external perturbation of an ideal gas torus around a nonrotating black hole or neutron star .",
    "they found that the torus performs harmonic global oscillations in both the radial and the vertical directions with a variable amplitude in the later direction .",
    "these effects indicate the existence of a nonlinear coupling into the system .    we know that a system of @xmath4 degrees of freedom has @xmath4 linear natural frequencies denoting @xmath5 ( nayfeh & mook 1979 ) . depending on the order of nonlinearity to the system ,",
    "these frequencies are commensurable with certain relationships which may cause the corresponding modes to be strongly coupled and yield an internal resonance .",
    "if the system is excited by a mode of frequency @xmath6 , then frequencies might have the commensurable relationship exhibiting the resonance @xmath7 ( apart from all the primary and secondary resonance conditions @xmath8 , where @xmath9 corresponds to the @xmath10th mode , @xmath11 are integers ) such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 when @xmath14 is the order of nonlinearity .",
    "certainly the order of nonlinearity determines the type of resonance conditions . for details , see nayfeh & mook ( 1979 ) .",
    "now we consider an accretion disk to be a system of higher degree nonlinearity and described as a damped oscillator with higher degree anharmonicity .",
    "then we consider the possible resonance therein .",
    "the resonance is expected to be driven by the combination of the strong disturbance by the compact object with spin @xmath15 and other already existent ( weaker ) disturbances in the disk particles ( and hence disk ) at the frequencies of the radial ( @xmath16 ) and vertical ( @xmath17 ) epicyclic oscillations given by ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is radial coordinate expressed in unit of @xmath21 , @xmath22 is specific angular momentum ( spin parameter ) of the compact object expressed in unit of @xmath23 , @xmath24 the newton s gravitation constant , @xmath25 is speed of light , @xmath26 is mass of the compact object , and @xmath27 is orbital frequency of the disk particles given by @xmath28    we describe the system schematically in fig .",
    "[ figcart ] .",
    "it can be seen to have composed of two oscillators , one in the radial direction ( radial epicyclic motion ) and other in the vertical direction ( vertical epicyclic motion ) , with different spring constants .",
    "note that spring constants here vary with radial coordinate .",
    "the basic idea is that the mode corresponding to @xmath15 arised due to the disturbance created by rotation of the compact object will couple to the ones corresponding to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , already exist in the disk , exciting new modes with frequencies @xmath29 ( nayfeh & mook 1979 ) , where @xmath30 is a number , e.g. @xmath31 when @xmath32 is an integer ( @xmath33 for the present model ) .",
    "now at a certain radius in the nonlinear regime where @xmath34 ( or @xmath15 in the linear regime ) is close to @xmath35 ( nayfeh & mook 1979 ; kluzniak et al .",
    "2004 ) , if @xmath34 ( or @xmath15 ) is also coincidentally close to the frequency difference of any two newly excited modes , then a resonance may occur which locks the frequency difference of two excited modes at @xmath34 ( or @xmath15 ) . for a neutron star having a magnetosphere coupled with the disk matter , the mode with @xmath15 can easily disturb disk particles through the interaction between surface current density in the disk and the stellar magnetic field and get coupled with the modes existing in the disk .",
    "ghosh & lamb ( 1979a , b ) showed , close to the stellar surface , how does the magnetic field channel matter to the polar caps .",
    "later , anzer & brner ( 1980 , 1983 ) showed the influence of the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "however , lmxb have a very low surface field strength and a low critical fastness parameter compared to highly magnetized neutron stars ( li & wickramasinghe 1997 ; li & wang 1999 ) . therefore ,",
    "in this case , the strength of the disturbance is expected to be low and the accretion disk usually extends close to the stellar surface ( popham & sunyaev 2001 ) .    for a black hole ,",
    "on the other hand , energy and angular momentum can be transferred with the magnetic field , associated with its disk , threading the horizon and connecting to the surrounding environment which may be looked as a variant of blandford - znajek process ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "in fact , this kind of magnetic coupling process was already supported by xmm - newton observations ( e.g. wilms 2001 ; li 2002 ) .",
    "this confirms the possible excitation of new modes in the disk around a spinning a black hole .",
    "note , as remarked by karas ( 1999 ) in a similar context , that the disk particle size should be finite to visibly modulate the observed radiation due to the resonance for a long period .",
    "however , shearing effect destroys large particles .",
    "abramowicz et al . ( 1992 ) suggested that formation of vortices in accretion disks could help in surviving finite size particles which was verified by adams & watkins ( 1995 ) .",
    "while the origin of vortex is not fully understood yet , finite amplitude threedimensional secondary perturbations may form elliptical vortices in disks surviving for a long period ( mukhopadhyay , afshordi , narayan 2005 ; mukhopadhyay 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , mukhopadhyay ( 2008 ) , based on it , argued for the origin of turbulent viscosity in accretion disks .",
    "therefore , we rewrite ( [ frqrel ] ) for an accretion disk as @xmath36 which leads to @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 are integers .",
    "now we propose the higher and lower qpo frequencies of a pair respectively to be @xmath40 hence , from ( [ intrel ] ) and ( [ frqrelac2 ] ) we understand the possible order of nonlinearity in accretion disks exhibiting qpos @xmath41 . in the next section , we will reproduce several observational results , were not addressed by other qpo models , what justify the proposition .    in the disk around a neutron star , at an appropriate radius where @xmath42 ( kluzniak et al . 2004 ) and the resonance is supposed to take place , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and for @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to a nonlinear coupling between the radial epicyclic mode and the disturbance due to spin of the neutron star , which results in @xmath48 locking in the nonlinear regime with @xmath49 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath50 corresponds to a linear coupling , which results in @xmath48 locking in the linear regime with @xmath51 .",
    "hence , for the resonance @xmath32 must be equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the resonance with , e.g. , @xmath52 for a neutron star corresponds to a linear coupling of the epicyclic and the disturbance modes .",
    "this results in the locking of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) to be in the nonlinear regime which is forbidden or very weak to observe .",
    "similarly , @xmath55 may correspond to higher harmonics of the coupling in the nonlinear regime which are again expected to be weak to make any observable effects .",
    "it is expected that for a fast rotating neutron star the disturbance occurs in the nonlinear regime .",
    "however , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 and then @xmath56 and @xmath57 vary as functions of radial coordinate . therefore , @xmath58 varies as well .",
    "we argue that in a small range of radius , as given in table 1 , the resonance condition remains satisfied approximately , when @xmath48 decreases slowly with @xmath57 , hence explains observed data .",
    "indeed observations show @xmath48 ( may vary over @xmath59hz for a particular neutron star ) to be of the order of @xmath60 or @xmath61 only , but not to be @xmath60 or @xmath61 exactly . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we describe these facts for stars with @xmath62 and @xmath15 both .",
    "the vertical dot - dashed line indicates the location of the resonance .    for a black hole , however , in absence of a magnetosphere , the disturbance and then corresponding coupling between modes may not be nonlinear and occurs with the condition @xmath63 , which results in the resonance locking at the linear regime with @xmath45 which produces @xmath64 ( sometimes @xmath65 ) as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a , b .",
    "however , if we enforce the resonance to occur at marginally stable circular orbit , at the very inner edge of an accretion disk where the underlying physics is expected to be nonlinear than that in the relatively outer edge , then a nonlinear resonance occurs with @xmath66 ( sometime @xmath67 ) and @xmath63 for @xmath43 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]c , d . in the following sections",
    "this is discussed in detail .",
    "the difference between resonance conditions to form qpos around black holes and neutron stars might be due to difference in their environment . for a neutron star ,",
    "there is a rotating magnetosphere imprinting directly the spin frequency on the oscillations of the disk .",
    "however , energy and angular momentum of a black hole with magnetic field connecting to the surrounding disk can be transferred to the disk through the variant blandford - znajek process .",
    "this leads to the strong resonance , expected to be driven by the disturbance at the spin frequency of the black hole , even though the exact physical mechanism remains to be determined .",
    "another important point to note is that for a black hole there is no strict definition of @xmath15 corresponding to its boundary layer related to the spin parameter @xmath22 , while for a neutron star it is obvious due to presence of its hard surface .",
    "here we assume that the effective boundary of a black hole is at marginally stable circular orbit @xmath68 and @xmath15 corresponds to the frequency of a test particle at @xmath68 [ see equations ( [ bhfreq ] ) , ( [ bhfreqh ] ) ] .    from observational data we can determine the spin frequency of a neutron star . in computing qpo frequencies from our model",
    ", we need to determine the spin parameter @xmath22 .",
    "if we consider a neutron star to be spherical in shape with the equatorial radius @xmath69 , spin frequency @xmath15 , mass @xmath26 , radius of gyration @xmath70 , then moment of inertia and the spin parameter are computed @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "we know that for a solid sphere @xmath73 and a for hollow sphere @xmath74 .",
    "however , the shape of a very fast rotating neutron star is expected to be deviated from spherical to ellipsoidal .",
    "moreover , neutron stars are not expected to be perfect solid bodies .",
    "hence , in our calculation we choose @xmath75 in most cases ( see e.g. bejger & haensel 2002 ; cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) .    on the other hand , for a black hole of mass @xmath26",
    ", @xmath22 is the most natural quantity what we supply as an input .",
    "corresponding angular frequency of a test particle at any radius @xmath20 in the spacetime around it is then given by ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) @xmath76 we now define @xmath77 where @xmath68 is marginally stable circular orbit and light inside @xmath68 is practically not expected to reach us . therefore , supplying @xmath22 we can determine @xmath15 .",
    "for at least seven of neutron stars exhibiting twin khz qpos we know the spin frequency ( e.g. yin et al .",
    "2007 ; boutloukos & lamb 2008 ) in most occasions , qpo frequencies vary with time and show that the frequency difference in the pair decreases with the increase of lower qpo frequency .",
    "moreover , the frequency difference is of the order of half of the spin frequency of the star for fast rotators and of the spin frequency itself for slow rotators .",
    "we will show that our model successfully describes all the properties matching with observed data . in obtaining results , we choose primarily @xmath78 , @xmath79 along with a guess radius @xmath69 ; all are free parameters",
    ". however , this choice does not suffice observation mostly .",
    "hence , subsequently , we discuss results with other values of parameters .",
    "we analyze qpos from three fast rotating neutron stars whose spin frequencies are known : ks  1731 - 260 ( smith , morgan & bradt 1997 ) , 4u  1636 - 53 ( jonker , mendez , & van der klis 2002 ) and 4u  1608 - 52 ( mendez et al . 1998 ) . for various sets of input values of @xmath26 and @xmath80 we predict radius of the neutron star , given in table 1 , in reproducing observed data by our theory , depicted in figs .",

    "figures [ fig2]a , b describe the resonance and corresponding formation of qpos for the black hole gro  j1655 - 40 with @xmath115 and @xmath116hz .",
    "the vertical dot - dashed line indicates the location of the resonance .",
    "it clearly says that @xmath63 at @xmath117 and the resonance occurs with @xmath118 ( say , @xmath119 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "similar resonance happens for other black holes .",
    "the corresponding spin parameter ranges from @xmath120 to @xmath121 , depending on mass of the black hole .",
    "however , if we enforce qpos to happen at @xmath68 strictly by changing mass ( within observed range of estimate ) and the spin parameter of a black hole , then they produce for @xmath43 at a higher @xmath22 .",
    "figures [ fig2]c , d describe such a formation of qpos for the source gro  j1655 - 40 with @xmath122 and @xmath123hz .",
    "it again implies that the resonance corresponds to @xmath63 , but with @xmath124 ( say , @xmath67 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) .",
    "however , in this case the required mass of black holes to reproduce observed qpos may be out of the range estimated from observed data and the corresponding @xmath22 appears to be similar / same for all four black holes .",
    "interesting fact to note is that the either case favors the fourth order nonlinearity in accretion disks around black holes and none of the parameter sets predict an extremally rotating black hole . in early , employing fully relativistic accretion disk model , the spin of black holes was estimated based on a spectral analysis of the x - ray continuum ( shafee et al .",
    "2006 ; mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "while their estimated spin for gro  j1655 - 40 is in accordance with ours , for grs  1915 + 105 it is higher ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "however , middleton et al . ( 2006 ) , based on a simple multicolor disk blackbody including full radiative transfer as well as relativistic effects , estimated spin of grs  1915 + 105 to be @xmath126 which tallies with ours .",
    "perhaps , different estimate is due to difference in method and the disk model used for computation .",
    "indeed , the best model to describe a geometrically thick accretion disk is still a matter of controversy .",
    "in fact , wang , ye & huang ( 2007 ) showed how does the spin estimate vary with different method .",
    "we have described qpos , particularly the khz / hf ones , observed from several neutron stars and black holes ( altogether ten compact sources ) , by a single model and predicted their spin .",
    "the model has addressed the variation of qpo frequency separation in a pair as a function of the qpo frequency itself of neutron stars , observed in several occasions .",
    "we argue that qpo is a result of higher ( fourth ) order nonlinear resonance in accretion disks .",
    "the model predicts the most possible set of parameters : @xmath127 km , @xmath128 for fast rotators ; @xmath129 km , @xmath130 for slow rotators , when @xmath131 , that can explain all the observed qpo pairs .",
    "discussing qpos for five different neutron stars ( ks  1731 - 260 , 4u  1636 - 53 , 4u  1608 - 52 , 4u  1702 - 429 , 4u  1728 - 34 ) whose spin frequencies are known , we have predicted the spin frequency of sco  x-1 which is unknown until this work .",
    "we argue that this is a slow rotator .",
    "we have addressed qpos from four black holes ( gro  j1655 - 40 , xte  j1550 - 564 , h1743 - 322 , grs  1915 + 105 ) whose mass ( or range of mass ) has already been predicted from observed data and qpo pair seems to appear at a @xmath3 ratio .",
    "based on the present model , we have predicted their spin parameters ( @xmath22-s ) which are not well established yet . according to the present model , none of them is an extremally rotating black hole .",
    "as our model explains qpos observed from several compact objects including their specific properties , of that in black holes and neutron stars both , it favors the idea of qpos to originate from a unique mechanism , independent of the nature of compact objects .",
    "a successful model should be able to reproduce properties globally as the one does presented here .",
    "now the future job should be to perform numerical simulations to establish the resonance described here to confirm the model .",
    "importantly , one should compare the energy released from the oscillation with that from rest of the disk ( and the neutron star surface , if qpo is from a neutron star ) to address visibility of oscillations . in this connection , the variation of the disturbance in the disk due to rotation of the compact object",
    "should be employed properly into the model to pinpoint the largest possible radius , beyond that qpo does not occur , accurately .",
    "this work is partly supported by a project ( grant no .",
    "sr / s2/hep12/2007 ) funded by department of science and technology ( dst ) , india .",
    "the author would like to thank the referee for his / her encouraging comment which has helped to prepare the final version of the paper .",
    "thanks are also directed to shashikant gupta of iisc for discussion about @xmath92-fitting and sudip bhattacharyya of tifr for quickly providing references of neutron stars with known spin and qpo frequencies .",
