    "transmitting messages with perfect secrecy using physical layer techniques was first studied in @xcite on a physically degraded discrete memoryless wiretap channel model . later , this work was extended to more general broadcast channel in @xcite and gaussian channel in @xcite , respectively .",
    "wireless transmissions , being broadcast in nature , can be easily eavesdropped and hence require special attention to design modern secure wireless networks .",
    "secrecy rate and capacity of point - to - point multi - antenna wiretap channels have been reported in the literature by several authors , e.g. , @xcite . in the above works , the transceiver operates in half - duplex mode , i.e. , either it transmits or receives at any given time instant .",
    "on the other hand , full - duplex operation gives the advantage of simultaneous transmission and reception of messages @xcite .",
    "but loopback self - interference and imperfect channel state information ( csi ) are limitations .",
    "full - duplex communication without secrecy constraint has been investigated by many authors , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "full - duplex communication with secrecy constraint has been investigated in @xcite , where the achievable secrecy rate region of two - way ( i.e. , full - duplex ) gaussian and discrete memoryless wiretap channels have been characterized . in the above works , csi in all the links are assumed to be perfect .    in this paper , we consider the achievable sum secrecy rate in miso _ full - duplex _ wiretap channel in the presence of a passive eavesdropper and imperfect csi .",
    "the users participating in full - duplex communication have multiple transmit antennas , and single receive antenna each .",
    "the eavesdropper is assumed to have single receive antenna .",
    "the norm of the csi errors in all the links are assumed to be bounded in their respective absolute values .",
    "in addition to a message signal , each user transmits a jamming signal in order to improve the secrecy rates .",
    "the users operate under individual power constraints . for this scenario ,",
    "we obtain the achievable perfect secrecy rate region by maximizing the worst case sum secrecy rate .",
    "we also obtain the corresponding transmit covariance matrices associated with the message signals and the jamming signals .",
    "numerical results that illustrate the impact of imperfect csi on the achievable secrecy rate region are presented .",
    "we also minimize the total transmit power ( sum of the transmit powers of users 1 and 2 ) with imperfect csi subject to receive signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) constraints at the users and eavesdropper , and individual transmit power constraints of the users .",
