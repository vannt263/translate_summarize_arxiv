    "in many scientific applications such as biology , the underlying physical problem is so complex that we often do not know what is the appropriate governing equation to describe its dynamics .",
    "typically , there are several dominating components that could contribute to the complex phenomena of the underlying physical solution .",
    "it is likely that each dominating component can be characterized by a dynamical system .",
    "although we do not know the precise governing equation for these complex phenomena , we can collect a lot of data to characterize the solution of the underlying physical system . a very interesting question to ask",
    "is whether or not it is possible to obtain some qualitative understanding of different dominating components from the data that we collect .",
    "one of the most important questions is whether the underlying dynamical system is linear or nonlinear .",
    "if it is nonlinear , can we quantify the degree of nonlinearity of the underlying dynamical system ?",
    "in this paper , we attempt to provide one possible approach via a recently proposed data - driven time - frequency analysis method @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used definition of linearity is that the output of a system is linearly dependent on the input .",
    "but this definition is not very practical since we may not even know the governing system precisely .",
    "it is not easy to define what is input and what is output without knowing the governing system .",
    "another difficulty is that the solution typically consists of several dominating components each of which accounts for a different physical mechanism .",
    "some of these mechanisms may be linear and others may be nonlinear .",
    "thus it is not a good idea to work on the entire data directly .",
    "we need to first decompose the data into several dominating components and then try to analyze these components separately .",
    "how to extract these intrinsic physical components from the data without compromising their hidden physical structure and integrity is highly nontrivial . for the data that we collect from a nonlinear system , such as the stokes wave",
    ", the classical fourier or wavelet analysis would decompose the signal to a collection of fundamental components and harmonics .",
    "each of the components , whether it is a fundamental or harmonic component , looks like a linear signal .",
    "a data analysis method based on these linear transformations would suggest that the signal is a superposition of linear components corresponding to a linear system rather than a nonlinear system .",
    "the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) method of huang et al @xcite provides a completely new way to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary signals .",
    "the emd method decomposes a signal into a collection of intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) sequentially .",
    "the basic idea behind this approach is the removal of the local median from a signal by using a sifting process and a cubic spline interpolation of local extrema .",
    "the emd method has found many applications , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one important property of these imfs is that they give physically meaningful hilbert spectral representation . on the other hand , since the emd method relies on the information of local extrema of a signal , it is unstable to noise perturbation .",
    "recently , an ensemble emd method ( eemd ) was proposed to make it more stable to noise perturbation @xcite . despite of the tremendous success of emd and eemd",
    ", there is still lack of a theoretical understanding of this method .",
    "we remark that the recently developed synchrosqueezed wavelet transform by daubechies , lu and wu @xcite is another attempt to provide a mathematical justification for an emd like method .    inspired by emd / eemd and the recently developed compressed ( compressive ) sensing theory @xcite , hou and shi",
    "have recently introduced a data - driven time - frequency analysis method @xcite .",
    "there are two important ingredients of this method .",
    "the first one is that the basis that is used to decompose the data is derived from the data rather than determined _ a priori_. this explains the name `` data - driven '' in our method .",
    "finding such nonlinear multiscale basis is an essential ingredient of our method . in some sense ,",
    "our problem is more difficult than the compressed ( compressive ) sensing problem in which the basis is assumed to be known _ a priori_. the second ingredient is to look for the sparsest decomposition of the signal among the largest possible dictionary consisting of intrinsic mode functions . in our method , we reformulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization and find the basis and the decomposition simultaneously by looking for the sparsest decomposition among all the possible decompositions .    in this paper , we develop a method to quantify the nonlinearity of the imfs given by the data - driven time - frequency analysis method .",
    "the main idea is to establish a connection between the imfs and the classical second order differential equations .",
    "the data - driven time - frequency analysis decomposes a multiscale signal into a sparse collection of imfs .",
    "these imfs are of the form @xmath0 where the amplitude @xmath1 is positive and slowly varying .",
    "the non - decreasing phase function @xmath2 is determined by the data and is in general nonlinear .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is that we show that each imf can be associated with a solution of a second order ordinary differential equation of the form @xmath9 .",
    "we further assume that the coefficients @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath10 are slowly varying with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we can freeze these coefficients locally in time and absorb the forcing function into @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to the reduced autonomous second order ode , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "further , we can reformulate the second order ode in a conservative form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "we then have the following weak formulation of the equation by integrating by parts : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the standard inner product , and @xmath17 is a smooth test function of compact support . if @xmath18 and @xmath19 have a sparse representation in terms of the polynomial basis , then we can represent @xmath20 and @xmath19 as follows : @xmath21 , @xmath22 for some integer @xmath23 .",
    "then we obtain the following weak formulation : @xmath24 based on the above weak formulation , we can design a @xmath4-based optimization method to solve for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 s are smooth test functions of compact support and @xmath29 is the number of the test functions .",
    "we will provide some guidance how to choose these test functions optimally .",
    "the method described above provides a new way to interpret the hidden intrinsic information contained in the extracted imf . depending on the local form of nonlinearity in @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", we can define the degree of nonlinearity for each associated imf .",
    "moreover , we also recover accurately the coefficients for the nonlinear terms in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this generalizes a similar concept recently introduced by prof .",
    "n. e. huang et .",
    "numerical examples will be provided to illustrate the robustness and stability of the proposed method .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review of the data - driven time - frequency analysis .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the connection between imfs and second order odes .",
    "we will illustrate through some examples that solutions of many linear and nonlinear second order odes have solutions that are essentially imfs . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce two numerical methods to extract the coefficients of the second order ode from a given imf .",
    "based on the degree of nonlinearity of the extracted coefficients , we introduce the degree of nonlinearity for each imf .",
    "this is called _ nonlinear degree analysis_. in section 5 , we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by a number of numerical examples . some concluding remarks are made in section 6 .",
    "the data - driven time - frequency analysis method is based on finding the sparsest decomposition of a signal by solving a nonlinear optimization problem .",
    "first , we need to construct a large dictionary that can be used to obtain a sparse decomposition of the signal . in our method , the dictionary is chosen to be : @xmath30 let @xmath31 be the collection of all the functions that are smoother than @xmath32 . in general , it is most effective to construct @xmath31 as an overcomplete fourier basis given below : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the largest integer less than @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is a parameter to control the smoothness of @xmath38 .",
    "the dictionary @xmath39 then becomes : @xmath40 each element of the dictionary @xmath39 is an imf with inter - wave frequency modulation . by an imf with inter - wave frequency modulation , we mean that both the amplitude @xmath1 and the instantaneous frequency @xmath41 are less oscillatory than @xmath32 . in the case when the instantaneous frequency @xmath41 is as oscillatory as @xmath32 or more oscillatory than @xmath32 , we call this imf has intra - wave modulation . the imfs with intra - wave frequency modulation are not included in this dictionary",
    ". we will consider the imfs with intra - wave frequency modulation in the next section . by saying that a function @xmath42 is less oscillatory than another function @xmath43 , we mean that @xmath42 contains fewer high frequency modes than those of @xmath43 or the high frequency mods of @xmath42 decay much faster than those of @xmath43 .",
    "since the dictionary @xmath39 is highly redundant , the decomposition over this dictionary is not unique .",
    "we need a criterion to select the `` best '' one among all possible decompositions .",
    "we assume that the data we consider have an intrinsic sparse structure in the time - frequency plane in some nonlinear and nonstationary basis .",
    "however , we do not know this basis _ a priori _ and we need to derive ( or learn ) this basis from the data . based on this consideration , we adopt sparsity as our criterion to choose the best decomposition .",
    "this criterion yields the following nonlinear optimization problem : @xmath44 where @xmath45 depends on the noise level of the signal .",
    "the above optimization problem can be seen as a nonlinear @xmath46 minimization problem .",
    "thanks to the recent developments of compressed sensing , two types of methods have been developed to study this problem .",
    "since we have infinitely many elements in the basis ( in fact uncountably many ) , we could not generalize basis pursuit directly to solve our problem . on the other hand , matching pursuit can be generalized",
    ". however , straightforward generalization of matching pursuit to our nonlinear optimization problem could be ill - conditioned and would introduce severe interference among different imfs . in order to develop a stable nonlinear optimization method and remove the interference , we add an @xmath4 term to regularize the nonlinear least squares problem .",
    "this gives rise to the following algorithm based on a @xmath4 regularized nonlinear least squares .",
    "we begin with @xmath47 .",
    "* step 1 * : solve the following @xmath4-regularized nonlinear least - square problem @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a regularization parameter and @xmath51 is the representation of @xmath52 in the overcomplete fourier basis . *",
    "step 2 * : update the residual @xmath53 * step 3 * : if @xmath54 , stop . otherwise , set @xmath55 and go to step 1 .",
    "if signals are periodic , we can use the standard fourier basis to construct @xmath31 instead of the overcomplete fourier basis .",
    "the @xmath4 regularization term is not needed ( i.e. we can set @xmath56 ) since the standard fourier basis are orthogonal to each other . for data with poor samples (",
    "i.e. the number of samples is not sufficient to resolve the signal ) or for data with poor scale separation , we would still require the @xmath4 regularization even for periodic data .",
    "one of the main difficulties in solving our @xmath4 regularized nonlinear least squares problem is that the objective functional is non - convex since the basis is not known _ a priori_. we need to find the basis and the decomposition simultaneously . in @xcite ,",
    "a gauss - newton type method was proposed to solve the @xmath4 regularized nonlinear least squares problem .",
    "the data - driven time - frequency analysis method described in the previous section is applicable to those signals whose imfs have only inter - wave modulation but do not have intra - wave frequency modulation . as we will see in section [ imf - ode ] , the imf with inter - wave frequency modulation",
    "is typically associated with a linear second order ode , while the imf with intra - wave frequency modulation is associated with a nonlinear second order ode . in order to analyze the nature of nonlinearity in a signal",
    ", we must consider those imfs with intra - wave frequency modulation . in this section ,",
    "we describe a modified data - driven time - frequency analysis method that is capable of decomposing signals which contain imfs with intra - wave frequency modulation .    for a signal that contains imfs with intra - wave frequency modulation",
    ", they still have a sparse decomposition : @xmath57 where @xmath58 are smooth amplitude functions .",
    "an important difference for data with intra - wave modulation is that their instantaneous frequencies , @xmath59 , are no longer in @xmath60 .",
    "typically , the phase function has the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a smooth function , @xmath63 is a small number and @xmath64 is a positive integer .",
    "an essential difficulty for this type of data is that the instantaneous frequency , @xmath59 , is as oscillatory as or even more oscillatory than @xmath65 . in the method proposed in the previous section",
    ", we assume that @xmath58 and @xmath66 are less oscillatory than @xmath65 .",
    "we use this property to construct the dictionary @xmath39 . in the case when an imf has strong intra - wave modulation , @xmath59 is as oscillatory as @xmath65 .",
    "thus the method described in the previous section would not be able to give a good approximation of @xmath67 . to overcome this difficulty , we introduce a shape function , @xmath68 , to replace the cosine function .",
    "the idea is to absorb the high frequency intra - wave modulation into the shape function @xmath68 .",
    "this will ensure that @xmath59 is still less oscillatory than @xmath69 .",
    "this idea was proposed by dr .",
    "wu in @xcite , but he did not provide an efficient algorithm to compute such shape function .    note that @xmath68 is not known _ a priori _ and is adapted to the signal .",
    "we need to learn @xmath68 from the physical signal .",
    "this consideration naturally motivates us to modify the construction of the dictionary as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath31 is defined in ( [ 2-fold - fourier-2 ] ) and @xmath68 is an unknown @xmath71-periodic ` shape function ' and is adapted to the signal . if we choose @xmath68 to be the cosine function , then the new dictionary @xmath72 is reduced to the dictionary @xmath39 that we used previously , i.e. @xmath73",
    ".    we also use `` sparsity '' as the criterion to select the decomposition over the redundant dictionary @xmath72 .",
    "this would give us the following optimization problem : @xmath74 where @xmath45 depends on the noise level of the signal .",
    "the above optimization problem is much more complicated than ( [ opt - inter ] ) , since the shape function @xmath68 is also unknown instead of being determined _ a priori _ as in ( [ opt - inter ] ) . in order to simplify this problem",
    ", we further assume that the non - zero fourier coefficients of @xmath68 are confined to a finite number of low frequency modes , i.e. for each @xmath68 , there exists @xmath75 , such that @xmath76 we further assume that we know how to obtain an estimate for @xmath77 by some method .",
    "we call this the low - frequency confinement property of @xmath68 . based on this property of @xmath68",
    ", we can represent @xmath68 by its fourier series , @xmath78 for a given @xmath67 , we can use this representation and apply the singular value decomposition ( svd ) to recover the fourier coefficients @xmath79 of each @xmath68 .",
    "this enables us to obtain the shape function @xmath68 .",
    "once we get an approximation of the shape function @xmath68 , we can use @xmath68 to update @xmath67 .",
    "this process continues until it converges .",
    "the detail of this method will appear in a subsequent paper . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on using this generalized data analysis method to perform nonlinearity analysis of multiscale data whose imfs have intra - wave modulation .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper is to establish a connection between an imf that we decompose from a multiscale signal and a second order ode .",
    "moreover , we propose an effective method to find such second order ode and study the degree of nonlinearity of the associated ode . for a given imf of the form @xmath80 ,",
    "it is not difficult to show that it satisfies the following second order ordinary differential equation : @xmath81 let @xmath82 and @xmath83 , then we get a second order ode @xmath84 note that @xmath85 and @xmath86 in general depend on @xmath87",
    ". thus the above ode may be nonlinear in general .",
    "this formal connection does not give much information about the nature of the ode .",
    "we will perform further analysis to reveal the nature of the associated ode depending on the regularity of the amplitude , @xmath1 , and the instantaneous frequency , @xmath41 , of a given imf , @xmath88 .",
    "many second order linear differential equations with smooth coefficients have solutions that have the form of an imf , i.e. @xmath89",
    ". moreover , the corresponding amplitude @xmath90 and the instantaneous frequency @xmath91 are smoother than @xmath92 . to see this , we consider the following linear second order ode : @xmath93",
    "it can be also rewritten in the following form : @xmath94 where @xmath95 assume that @xmath96 and @xmath97 . using the wkb method @xcite",
    ", we can get the asymptotic approximation of @xmath98 , @xmath99 in terms of the original variables , the solution of ( [ eq : 2nd order homogeneous ode standart form ] ) has the form : @xmath100 which is essentially an imf without intra - wave frequency modulation in which both the amplitude and the instantaneous frequency are smoother than @xmath32 due to the smoothness of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    on the other hand , for those imfs @xmath103 that do not have intra - wave frequency modulation ( meaning that both @xmath1 and @xmath91 are smoother than @xmath104 ) , it is easy to see that the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath7 given in ( [ ode - imf - general - linear ] ) are smooth functions with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "this seems to suggest that there is a close connection between oscillatory solutions of a linear second order ode with smooth coefficients and imfs without intra - wave frequency modulation .      for imfs with intra - wave frequency modulation ,",
    "the situation is much more complicated . in this case , the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 that appear in equation ( [ ode - imf - general - linear ] ) are no longer smooth since @xmath91 is not smooth .",
    "as we will demonstrate later , intra - wave frequency modulation is usually associated with a solution of a nonlinear ode .",
    "consider a conservative system @xmath105 where @xmath106 for some smooth function @xmath107 .",
    "the total energy of the system is @xmath108 .",
    "assume @xmath109 for all values of @xmath110 in @xmath111 $ ] , except the end points where @xmath112 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath113 only at @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "take @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , the range of @xmath118 lies within @xmath119.$ ] if we define @xmath120 as a result , we have @xmath121 and @xmath122 , if @xmath123 . now , if @xmath124 , then @xmath125 . remember that @xmath126 as @xmath124 .",
    "similarly , we can show that as @xmath127 , we have @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the solution of @xmath105 can be represented as @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are constants and @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "the period @xmath134 of the oscillation , using @xmath135 , can be defined as a real positive number such that @xmath136 .    to illustrate this point further",
    ", we consider the solution of the duffing equation .",
    "the undamped duffing equation has the form @xmath137 .",
    "the energy @xmath138 of the system is @xmath139 .",
    "obviously , the potential energy is @xmath140 .",
    "now , assume that the solution varies within the interval @xmath141 $ ] . due to symmetry , we look for a solution of the form @xmath142 .",
    "substituting this into the energy equation gives @xmath143 which can be further simplified as @xmath144 the right hand side of this equation is strictly positive . since @xmath145 , we obtain @xmath146 this shows that the solution of the duffing equation is an imf with intra - wave frequency modulation .",
    "we can see that the peaks and troughs of the signal coincide with the maximum of the instantaneous frequency @xmath135 .",
    "in this section , we propose a new method to analyze the degree of nonlinearity of the imfs that we decompose from a multiscale signal . we will present an effective optimization method to construct a second order ode for each imf .",
    "moreover , based on the degree of the nonlinearity of the coefficients associated with the second order ode , we define the degree of nonlinearity for each imf .    to begin with , we consider the second order ode of the following type : @xmath147 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath10 are slowly varying with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "for example , in case of the duffing equation , we have @xmath148 .    based on this assumption",
    ", we can freeze @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath10 locally in time over a local time interval ( a few periods ) since they vary slowly in time .",
    "thus we can replace the above ode by the corresponding autonomous ode over this local time interval and absorb @xmath42 into @xmath8 ( meaning that we can set @xmath149 ) : @xmath150 this approximation reduces the level of difficulty significantly .      in order to determine the autonomous ode locally",
    ", we propose to use polynomials to approximate @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the order of polynomials which is given _ a prior _ , @xmath153 are unknown coefficients .    one way to get the coefficients @xmath154 is to substitute ( [ poly - ab ] ) to ( [ nonlinear - model - local ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath155 then @xmath153 can be obtained by using a least squares method , @xmath156 to study the degree of nonlinearity , we are most interested in the highest order terms in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "further we assume that the coefficients @xmath157 and @xmath26 are sparse . due the strong correlation between @xmath110 and @xmath158 , the direct least",
    "squares proposed in ( [ ls - strong ] ) would be unstable to noise perturbation . in order to stabilize this optimization algorithm",
    ", we add a @xmath4 term to regularize the least squares and look for the sparsest representation , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a parameter to control the sparsity of the coefficients . in order to capture the leading order term ,",
    "@xmath160 is chosen to be @xmath161 . in the following examples , @xmath160",
    "is chosen to be 2 .    in the method described above , we need to compute @xmath162 and @xmath158 .",
    "this tends to amplify the error introduced in our approximation of the imf , @xmath110 .",
    "next , we will introduce another method based on the weak formulation of the second order ode .      in this section",
    ", we will introduce a @xmath4-based optimization based on a weak formulation for the second order ode .",
    "let @xmath20 be the primitive function of @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath163 . then the ode can be rewritten in a conservation form : @xmath164 suppose the span of time of the signal that we want to study is @xmath165 $ ] . for any test function @xmath166",

    "the test functions that we use are given below : @xmath174 where @xmath175 s ( @xmath176 ) are the centers of the test functions and the parameter @xmath177 determines their support . in order to enhance stability",
    ", we should make the support of the test functions as large as possible by choosing a large @xmath177 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the support of @xmath17 is too large , we can not get the high frequency information of the signal , which is essential in capturing the nonlinearity of the signal .",
    "thus , we should determine @xmath177 based on the balance between stability and resolution .",
    "the strategy that we use is that to make @xmath177 as large as possible without compromising the resolution . in our computations",
    ", @xmath177 is chosen to be 1/5 of the local period ( or wavelength ) of the signal .",
    "after @xmath177 is determined , we choose @xmath178 to be uniformly distributed over @xmath179 $ ] , where @xmath165 $ ] is the time span of the signal .",
    "the choice of @xmath177 depends on the regularity of the signal that we want to study .",
    "if the signal is nearly singular , we should choose a small @xmath177 to make sure that the information of the signal can be well captured by the test functions .    if the test functions @xmath180 are chosen to be the classical piecewise linear finite element basis , then the weak formulation is equivalent to the strong formulation if we approximate @xmath162 and @xmath158 by a second order central difference approximation .",
    "based on the coefficients that we recover from the signal , we can define two indices associate with each imf to characterize the nonlinearity of this imf .",
    "( degrees of nonlinearity ) the degrees of nonlinearity of an imf are defined to be the following two indices @xmath181    from the above definition , we can see that the degrees of nonlinearity of the signal correspond to the highest order of the nonlinear terms .",

    "when @xmath184 or @xmath185 , the imf becomes nonlinear .",

    "we not only quantify the degrees of nonlinearity of the imf , we can also recover the coefficients associated with the leading order nonlinear terms .",
    "this information is very helpful in quantifying how nonlinear an imf is and may have an important implication in engineering and biomedical applications .    in practical computations ,",
    "the signal may be polluted by noise or measurement errors . as a result",
    ", our recovery of the coefficients will be influenced by these errors .",
    "to alleviate this side effect , we set up a small threshold @xmath186 to enforce sparsity of the coefficients by keeping only those coefficients that are larger than @xmath186 .",
    "this leads to the following modified definition of the degrees of nonlinearity : @xmath187 in the computations to be presented in the next section , we set @xmath188 .",
    "the method based on the @xmath4 regularized least squares performs very well in identifying those nonlinear terms with large coefficients . on the other hand",

    "but when the signal is polluted with noise , the imf that we extract from the signal is not very accurate . in this case , the error of the coefficients is still relatively large even with the above refinement procedure .",
    "before we end this section , we summarize all the discussions to give the following algorithm .",
