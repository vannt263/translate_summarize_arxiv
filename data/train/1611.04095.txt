    "<S> we consider a random object that is associated with both random walks and random media , specifically , the superposition of a configuration of subcritical bernoulli percolation on an infinite connected graph and the trace of the simple random walk on the same graph . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate asymptotics for the number of vertices of the enlargement of the trace of the walk until a fixed time , when the time tends to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> this process is more highly self - interacting than the range of random walk , which yields difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> we show a law of large numbers on vertex - transitive transient graphs . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the process on a vertex - transitive graph with the process on a finitely modified graph of the original vertex - transitive graph and show their behaviors are similar . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the process fluctuates almost surely on a certain non - vertex - transitive graph . on the two - dimensional integer lattice , by investigating the size of the boundary of the trace , we give an estimate for variances of the process implying a law of large numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we give an example of a graph with unbounded degrees on which the process behaves in a singular manner . as by - products </S>",
    "<S> , some results for the range and the boundary , which will be of independent interest , are obtained . </S>"
