    "hard x - ray emission in the brightest low - mass x - ray binaries ( hereafter lmxbs ) , the so - called z - sources , was occasionally detected in the past ( see e.g.   peterson & jacobson 1966 ) .",
    "these results received relatively little attention , mostly because the lack of a broad - band spectral coverage did not permit to establish whether an extra component was indeed required to fit the hard spectrum of these sources .",
    "renewed interest in the hard x - ray emission properties of bright lmxbs was motivated by recent broad - band studies mainly performed with rxte ( 2  200 kev ) and bepposax ( 0.1  200 kev ) .",
    "these have shown that most z - sources display variable , hard power - law shaped components , dominating their spectra above @xmath2  kev ( see di salvo & stella 2000 for a review ) .",
    "the hard component detected in bright ( otherwise soft ) lmxbs can be fitted by a power law , with photon index in the range 1.93.3 , contributing from 1% to 10% of the observed ( @xmath3 kev ) source luminosity .",
    "the presence of these components in z sources seems sometimes to be related to the source state or its position in the x - ray color - color diagram ( hereafter cd ) .",
    "the clearest example to date is in the bepposax observation of gx  17 + 2 , where the hard component ( a power - law with photon index of @xmath4 ) showed the strongest intensity in the horizontal branch ( hb ) of its cd ( di salvo et al .",
    "a factor of 20 decrease was observed when the source moved from the hb to the normal branch ( nb ) , i.e.  from low to high ( inferred ) mass accretion rate .",
    "a hard tail was also detected in almost all the currently known z sources ( e.g. di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ; iaria et al .  2001",
    "; di salvo et al .",
    "2002 ; asai et al .",
    "the fact that a similar hard component has been observed in several z sources indicates that this is probably a common feature of these sources .",
    "however , the origin of this hard component is still poorly understood .",
    "while in most cases the hard component becomes weaker at higher accretion rates , hexte observations of sco x1 showed a hard power - law tail in 5 out of 16 observations , without any clear correlation with the position in the cd ( damico et al .",
    "the thermal vs.  non - thermal nature of this component remains to be addressed , yielding important information on the production mechanism .",
    "sco x1 , the brightest persistent x - ray source in the sky , is also the brightest radio source among neutron star lmxbs , with a mean radio flux about 10 times higher than that of the other z sources ( e.g.   fender & hendry 2000 ) .",
    "a hard x - ray power - law component has been observed in rxte / hexte ( 20200 kev ) data of this source ( damico et al .",
    "as already mentioned , contrary to the case of gx  17 + 2 , in sco x1 the flux of this component was observed to vary without any clear correlation with the position in the cd .",
    "interestingly , strickman & barret ( 2000 ) report that the hard x - ray emission present in osse data of sco x1 may be correlated with periods of radio flaring .    to study the hard x - ray emission in , the brightest of these sources , as well as its correlation with other source properties ( such as radio emission and fast timing variability )",
    ", we have performed a campaign of observations of sco x1 with integral and rxte .",
    "part of these observations were also done simultaneously with radio vlbi observations ( which will be discussed elsewhere ) .",
    "the integral spectrum of  shows with high statistical significance the presence of a hard ( power - law ) component , without any clear exponential cutoff up to @xmath5 kev .",
    "we also find clear evidence that the intensity of this component is correlated with the position of the source in the x - ray cd .",
    "sco x-1 was observed during two complete integral revolutions on 2003 july 30  august 1 and 2003 august 11  13 .",
    "the integral payload consists of two main @xmath6-ray instruments , a spectrometer , spi ( vedrenne et al .",
    "2003 ) and an imager , ibis , and of two monitor instruments , the x - ray monitor jem - x ( 3  35 kev , lund et al .",
    "2003 ) and the optical monitoring camera ( v band , 500 - 600 nm , mas - hesse et al .",
    "the ibis instrument ( ubertini et al .  2003 ) covers the energy range between 20 kev and 8 mev with two detectors , isgri ( lebrun et al .",
    "2003 ) and picsit ( di cocco et al .  2003 ) and has a field of view of @xmath7 at half sensitivity ( @xmath8 fully coded ) with a point spread function of @xmath9 fwhm .",
    "the spi also covers the energy range between 20 kev and 8 mev with a fov of @xmath10 diameter ( @xmath11 fully coded ) and an angular resolution of @xmath12 .",
    "observations were performed in the usual integral format , i.e. the observation was split in separate exposures ( `` science windows '' , or scws ) , each lasting @xmath13 sec , followed by a 5 minutes slew .",
    "the exposures were arranged following a @xmath14 dither pattern .",
    "the ibis and spi instruments were operated in standard mode during the whole observation , while jem - x was in a non - standard mode ( spec ) which , unfortunately , is not yet calibrated .",
    "we therefore discarded the jem - x data from our analysis .",
    "the effective exposure time was 372 ks for ibis and 358 ks for spi .",
    "the ibis data were analyzed using the standard analysis procedures of osa version 5 and the latest response matrices ( october 2004 ) rebinned to 26 channels between 15 and 800 kev and the latest spectral extraction routines ( goldwurm et al .",
    "a systematic error of @xmath15 was applied to all the integral / isgri spectra .    during all the observations ,",
    "sco x-1 was the only source detected in the wide fov of the instruments .",
    "the source coordinates as derived from the isgri mosaic image in the 20  35 kev energy band are : ra = 16 19 54.9 , dec = 15 38 34.4 ( uncertainty @xmath16 , 1 sigma confidence level ) at about @xmath17 from the simbad position ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2003 ) . to study the source spectral state in the standard x - ray band , we also analyzed data from the proportional counter array ( pca ; zhang et al .",
    "1993 ) on board rxte , which consists of five co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcus ) , with a total collecting area of 6250 @xmath18 and a field of view , limited by collimators , of @xmath19 fwhm , sensitive in the energy range @xmath20 kev .",
    "the rxte observation , performed simultaneously with the integral observation , is divided into two parts of 175 ks each , approximately two weeks apart from each other .",
    "we selected intervals for which the elevation angle of the source above the earth limb was greater than 10 degrees . on a few occasions ,",
    "some of the five pcus were off ; we therefore used only data from pcus 2 and 3 which where on for most of the observation .",
    "the x - ray cd of sco x-1 during the integral observations , obtained from the pca data , is shown in figure  1 . during each of the two observations the source described a fairly complete z - track in the cd .    in order to check for the presence of the hard tail in our data , we first analysed the integral ( ibis / isgri , energy band 20 kev  200 kev ) spectrum integrated over the whole observation ( see figure  2 , left panel ) .",
    "similar to what has been done for other lmxbs of the z - class , we fitted the integral spectrum with the comptonization model comptt ( whose description is given in titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "comptt is an analytical model describing the thermal comptonization of soft photons ( for which a wien spectrum is assumed ) inverse - compton scattered in a hot electron cloud with optical depth @xmath21 and whose temperature can range from a few kev to 500 kev .",
    "this model includes relativistic effects and works for optically thick and optically thin regimes .",
    "the geometry of the comptonizing cloud can be either spherical or disk - like . in this paper",
    "we assume a spherical geometry ( this assumption only affects the value of the optical depth derived from the fit ) .",
    "this model gives a good fit of the soft part of the  spectrum up to @xmath22 kev . above this energy ,",
    "a hard excess is clearly visible in the residuals , independently of the particular comptonization model used to fit the soft part of the spectrum .",
    "the fit is significantly improved by adding to the comptt model a power - law with photon index @xmath23 ( this gives a reduction of the @xmath24/dof from 892/13 to 14.4/11 ) .",
    "we tested the presence of a thermal cutoff in the hard power - law ; substituting the power law with a cutoff power - law ( that is a power law multiplied by an exponential cutoff ) does not improve the fit significantly ( the latter model gives a @xmath24/dof = 15.6/10 ) , and the temperature of the exponential cutoff is @xmath25 kev ( @xmath26 confidence level ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the isgri ( 20  200 kev ) spectrum are reported in table  1 ; data and residuals with respect to the best fit model are shown in figure  2 ( left panel ) .    to look for variability in the hard component with the spectral state of the source , as measured by its position in the x - ray cd",
    ", we divided the z - track in the cd of  into four parts corresponding to the hb / upper - nb , the nb , the flaring branch ( fb ) , and the nb / fb vertex , respectively .",
    "we therefore extracted integral / isgri spectra for each of the time intervals mentioned above , resulting in four cd resolved spectra .",
    "unfortunately there was no superposition between rxte and integral data in the fb during the first part of the observation .",
    "the integral / isgri exposure times for the four intervals were 52.4 ks , 45.5 ks , 60.6 ks and 6 ks .",
    "we fitted each of this spectra with comptt and a cutoff power law .",
    "this model gave a good fit of the first three spectra , with little variability in the spectral parameters ( see table  1 ) .",
    "for three of these spectra , the hard power law component was required in order to fit the data .",
    "remarkably the fb spectrum did not require a power - law component and could be fitted with a simple comptonization model ( see fig .  2 , right panel ) .",
    "including the power law in the spectral fit of the fb spectrum , with the photon index fixed at 3.1 , a good fit requires a decrease of the normalization of the power law component by a factor at least 5 with respect to the average spectrum . in table  1",
    "we show the total x - ray flux of  calculated in the @xmath27 kev and in the @xmath28 kev energy range , flux ( 2040 ) and flux ( 40200 ) , respectively . while the flux ( 2040 ) decreases from the hb to the nb / fb vertex and",
    "then increases when the source goes to the fb , the flux ( 40200 ) always decreases , varying by about one order of magnitude when the source moves from the hb to the fb .",
    "although from table  1 there seems to be a clear trend of the @xmath28 kev flux to decrease from the hb to the nb and fb vertex , the uncertainties on the hard x - ray flux are still quite large to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "in fact , in order to calculate the flux in a given energy range and the associated uncertainty , xspec needs to use the total best - fit model , which includes both the comptt and the cutoff power - law component ; each of these components has several parameters and the uncertainties on all the parameters are taken into account in the calculation of the source flux and its uncertainty .",
    "if we are interested in knowing the flux of the hard power - law component alone in a given energy range ( to see how this component evolves when the source moves in the x - ray cd ) , it is more convenient to use the model named pegpwrlw in xspec .",
    "this model allows to directly calculate the power - law flux in a given energy range ( @xmath29 kev is our choice ) and the associated uncertainty .",
    "we therefore substituted the cutoff power - law model with the pegpwrlw model to fit the integral spectra of .",
    "the results of the fits with the comptt plus pegpwrlw model are also reported in table  1 ( since the parameters of the comptt did not change significantly these are shown only once in the table ) .",
    "the decrease of the power - law @xmath29 kev flux along the cd is evident .",
    "for clarity , we have also plotted these power - law fluxes in figure  1 ( inset ) .",
    "we report on a spectral analysis of a simultaneous @xmath30  ks - long observation of  with integral and rxte .",
    "we show that the addition of a hard power - law component dominating the x - ray spectrum above @xmath2 kev proves necessary for a good fit of the integral ( @xmath29 kev ) spectrum .",
    "the power law is quite steep , with a photon index of about 3.1 , contributing up to 12% of the observed @xmath31 kev luminosity , and does not show any evidence of a high energy cutoff up to @xmath32 kev . similarly to what was observed in the bepposax observation of the z source gx  17 + 2 , the presence of the hard component in  seems to be related to the position of the source in the z track ; in fact we observe a clear trend of the @xmath29 kev power - law flux to decrease when the inferred mass accretion rate increases ( i.e.  from the hb to the nb / fb vertex ) . at",
    "the highest inferred mass accretion rate ( i.e.  in the fb of the x - ray cd ) , the hard x - ray emission seems to disappear completely ( the hard x - ray flux decreases by about one order of magnitude with respect to the flux measured in the hb / upper - nb ) .",
    "note , however , that the behavior of the hard component in the fb may be variable ( c.f .",
    "damico et .",
    "al .  2001 ) .",
    "one of the most interesting results of this analysis is that the hard power law detected in  does not show any evidence of a high energy cutoff , with lower limits on the electron temperature that are in most cases above 100 kev ( the lower limit on a thermal cutoff in the  averaged integral spectrum , where the statistics is the highest , is about 200 kev ) .",
    "such high temperatures are not expected in a system like , because of the strong compton cooling due to the primary soft spectrum , where most of the energy is emitted .",
    "these results therefore indicate that , in analogy with the steep hard power - law emission detected in some soft states ( e.g.  intermediate and very high ) of systems containing a black hole candidates , which do not show any energy cutoff up to a few hundreds kev , the hard power law observed in z sources may be of non - thermal origin .",
    "the most probable origin of these components are therefore comptonization in a hybrid thermal / non - thermal corona ( where the maxwellian velocity distribution of the electrons have a non - thermal high - velocity tail , e.g.  poutanen & coppi 1998 ; see farinelli et al .",
    "2005 and da  et al .",
    "2006 for a successful application of this model to the case of gx  17 + 2 and , respectively ) .",
    "for instance , it is possible that a hard population of electrons is accelerated in internal shocks at the base of a jet .",
    "otherwise the hard power law may originate in a mildly relativistic ( @xmath33 ) bulk motion of matter close to the compact object .",
    "therefore non - thermal comptonization in outflows ( or jets ) may be the origin of these components , with flatter power laws corresponding to higher optical depths of the scattering medium and/or higher bulk electron velocities ( e.g.  psaltis 2001 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that non - thermal , high energy electrons , responsible for the hard tails observed in z sources , might be accelerated in a jet ( di salvo et al .",
    "this is also confirmed by the observed correlation between the strength of the hard x - ray emission and the position of the source in the x - ray cd .",
    "in fact all z sources are detected as variable radio sources with the highest radio flux associated with the hb and the lowest with the fb ( migliari & fender 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "in other words , both the radio emission from these objects , which is probably due to jets ( fender & hendry 2000 ) , and the hard x - ray emission are anticorrelated with the inferred mass accretion rate . in this respect , it will be very important to study the direct correlation between the presence and strength of the hard x - ray emission and the radio activity of the source .",
    "the radio ( vla ) observations of , simultaneous to part of the integral observations , is under investigation and will be discussed elsewhere .",
