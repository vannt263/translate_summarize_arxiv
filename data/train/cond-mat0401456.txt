    "the question of the existence of intrinsic mechanisms , i.  e. due to interactions occuring in the beam - splitter device itself , has been answered positively by us @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , a simple quantum dot connected to ferromagnetic contacts can lead to positive cross - correlations due the so - called _ dynamical spin - blockade_. simply speaking , up- and down - spins tunnel through the dot with different rates . in the limit where the coulomb interaction prevents a double occupancy of the dot ,",
    "the spins which tunnel with a lower rate modulate the tunneling of the other spin - direction , which leads to an effective _ bunching _ of tunneling events . in a three terminal geometry with one input and two outputs , this results in positive cross - correlation between the two output currents .",

    "these features are a consequence of dynamical spin blockade : up spins leave the dot with a rate smaller than down spins , leading to a bunching of tunneling events @xcite . in the limit @xmath81 ,",
    "the fano factor is always sub - poissonian and the cross - correlations always negative .",
    "this is due to the fact  that the tunnel rates of up and down spins are equal , thus the zeeman splitting plays no role and the dot is equivalent to a simple quantum dot with a spin - degenerate level . in the limit @xmath82 , one could also expect the super - poissonian nature of @xmath77 and the positivity of @xmath78 to be lost since the transport is enabled only by thermally activated processes .",

    "it is interesting to note that a symmetric junction @xmath85 produces twice the poisson noise level .",

    "[ fig : cross ] shows the effect of spin - flip scattering on the cross - correlations .",

    "like for the fano factor , very small spin - flip scattering rates @xmath93 are already sufficient to modify @xmath78 for @xmath120 .",
