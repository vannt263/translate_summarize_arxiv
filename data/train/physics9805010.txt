    "although thallium doped csi crystals are widely used in high energy physics detectors @xcite , new precision experiments at the b - meson factories presently under construction  @xcite rely on  calorimeters with improved energy resolution , electronic noise , and crystal radiation hardness .",
    "the energy resolution at low energies is influenced by the ( temperature dependent ) crystal light yield , which should be stable over long time periods and maximized to achieve low electronic noise  @xcite . because of fluctuations of electromagnetic showers in the crystals it is necessary to know and to optimize the uniformity of light output .",
    "related studies can be found in the literature @xcite , but there are often descrepancies between laboratory studies performed with photomultipliers and the actual photodiode readout used in calorimeters .",
    "one reason is the very different sensitivity of both readout devices at the wavelength of the  scintillation light .",
    "+ we will limit ourselves to investigations which are relevant for large high energy physics calorimeters . after introducing setups , which allow comparable and precise crystal measurements with photomultipliers and photodiodes ,",
    "we describe a method to improve the crystal light yield and response uniformity . using light yield optimized crystals we studied several ways to couple photodiodes to crystals and to enhance the thereby minimizing the equivalent electronic noise energy .",
    "since temperature and radiation can alter the crystal light yield , their influence was investigated with both readout setups .",
    "these investigations were performed as part of early studies for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the babar detector .",
    "the  crystals used in this study were supplied by monokristal / kharkov ( ukraine ) .",
    "their thallium content amounts to @xmath1 .",
    "the crystals were slightly tapered with a front face of @xmath2 , rear face dimensions of @xmath3 , and a length of @xmath0 , which corresponds to 19.4 radiation lengths .",
    "+      the scintillation light of  with a peak emission wavelength at @xmath4 was read out using a hamamatsu r669 photomultiplier tube with a multialkali photocathode ( @xmath5 diameter ) , which has an enhanced sensitivity in this wavelength range  @xcite .",
    "the photomultiplier , which was coupled to the crystals via a minimal airgap , was operated at @xmath6 ( anode grounded ) , and read out by ac coupling to an ortec preamplifier model 113 with an input capacity of @xmath7 . a spectroscopic amplifier , ortec model 672 , provided a gaussian shaping with @xmath8 time constant and an additional amplification .",
    "a peak sensitive adc , ortec 800 , was dc coupled to the amplifier in order to avoid an additional differentiation of the pulse at the adc input . for pile - up",
    "rejection the corresponding signal from the shaping amplifier was fed into the adc .",
    "a pc based multichannel analyzer from target with the corresponding tmca software was used for data acquisition .",
    "+ for position dependent measurements of the light output , a radioactive @xmath9 source with a lead collimator was moved along the length of the crystal .",
    "the energy of the @xmath9 source , the collimator outer dimensions , and the pin - hole diameter of the collimator were optimized in order to get a focused illumination at the crystal surface and a sufficient penetration depth .",
    "finally the collimator was laid out as an almost half - sphere with @xmath5 radius and a pin - hole diameter of @xmath10 .",
    "it was located @xmath11 above the crystal surface and contained a  source with @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath9 energy .",
    "these parameters resulted in a mean spot diameter at the crystal surface of @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] .",
    "+ a step - width of @xmath15 was chosen for the motorized translation stage moving the collimator because of the spot size . at each collimator position",
    "a dead - time corrected spectrum was taken for 100 seconds , resulting in a total measurement time of about half an hour for 18 positions along the crystal .",
    "the region of the photopeak was fit to the sum of a gaussian distribution and an exponential background . in order to quote a crystal light yield ,",
    "the 18 peak positions were averaged and related to the position of the corresponding peak for a small cubic  crystal ( @xmath16 on an edge ) .",
    "this standard crystal was remeasured regularly .",
    "thus , total  values given in this article are relative to this standard crystal .",
    "+    for precise measurements of different crystals , independent of photomultiplier drift , gain variations , and environmental influences , two different monitoring systems were developed .",
    "one consisted of an  source placed on a small hole in the crystal wrapping material at the front end of the crystal .",
    "this source emits @xmath17-particles with an energy of about @xmath18 , which generate a constant amount of scintillation light in the crystal .",
    "[ fig : csam ] shows a pulse height spectrum of a @xmath19cs @xmath9-source with a @xmath20am @xmath17-source as reference attached to a large crystal .",
    "when the crystal is scanned with the @xmath19cs @xmath9-source , the variations of the position of the @xmath17-peak indicate drift of the electronics during the uniformity measurement , which is corrected during the analysis  @xcite .",
    "( 80,80 ) ( 58,5 ) ( -5,86 )    for this monitoring method , the error of the peak position was @xmath21 for spectra taken along one crystal , mainly due to the description of the background .",
    "however , the error for the total light yield of a particular crystal is much larger , since the @xmath17-line position may vary from crystal to crystal owing to variations in light generation and transmission .",
    "therefore , an external reference system was developed and operated under stable and controlled conditions .",
    "+ this system used a `` light normal '' consisting of an encapsulated combination of a nai(tl ) crystal and a  source .",
    "since the light output of this crystal is low , its light can not directly be coupled to the r669 photomultiplier . instead",
    ", it is detected by another photomultiplier ( philips rca 8575 ) , which is in addition illuminated by a green led .",
    "the led is pulsed by an adjustable voltage and frequency .",
    "this setup is located in a light tight , temperature stabilized box .",
    "a fixed fraction of the led light is fed , via a @xmath22 long glass fiber with negligible temperature dependence , into the entrance window of the r669 photomultiplier which measures the  crystals .",
    "a sketch of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : refsetup ] .    variations in the led light and in the gain of the photomultiplier of the reference system are corrected by the output of the light normal . in this way",
    "an error of better than @xmath23 for the total crystal light yield was achieved and verified by long - term comparisons of a few crystals . at this level of accuracy ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the crystal light yield becomes important .",
    "therefore the crystals were located in a styrofoam box and temperature sensors were attached on the wrapping material . the light yield for each crystal was corrected by the measured temperature dependence of the light output ( see section  [ sec : temp ] ) .",
    "+      for the light readout by photodiodes , radioactive sources of higher photon energy are required .",
    "we have chosen  with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the scintillation light is read out by two pin silicon photodiodes coupled to the crystal rear .",
    "two different types of photodiodes from hamamatsu were used , s  2744 - 08 with an active window size of @xmath26 for direct readout and s  3588 - 03 ( mod  5400 ) with an active area of @xmath27 for wavelength shifter readout .",
    "these types have an active layer of @xmath28 thickness and are sin passivated .",
    "the diodes are operated with a reverse bias voltage of @xmath29 with the cathode grounded .",
    "typical values for the dark current of @xmath30 and for the capacity of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are reported by the manufacturer for the types s  2744 - 08 and s  3588 - 03 ( mod  5400 ) , respectively .",
    "we measured the dark current of an initial sample of 110 diodes of type s  2744 - 08 in a temperature controlled environment using a keithley pa - meter to be @xmath33 .",
    "the same device was used for a measurement of the diode capacity .",
    "thereto a rectangular generator was set up using the diode as a capacitor determining the frequency of the generator .",
    "this frequency was converted into a voltage which was measured as a current over a @xmath34 resistor .",
    "the result was @xmath35 for 110 diodes .",
    "the quantum efficiency of both types are 85% ( 90% ) at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) @xcite .",
    "+ the optical coupling of the diodes to the crystal was varied and will be described in section  [ sec : coupling ] .",
    "the s of both photodiodes were measured individually by independent electronic readout chains  @xcite . in order to amplify the small pulses typically between 5000 and 8000 photoelectrons for a @xmath9 source energy of @xmath38 , charge",
    "sensitive preamplifiers , canberra 2003 t , were coupled via short co - axial cables to the diodes .",
    "crystal , photodiodes , and preamplifiers were located in a light tight box which also provided an electromagnetic shield . from the preamp output",
    "each signal was fed into a spectroscopic shaping amplifier , canberra aft  2025 , with @xmath39 ( gaussian ) shaping time and finally dc coupled into a peak sensitive adc , montedel laben model 8215 .",
    "the pile - up output of the amplifiers was connected to the corresponding adc input .",
    "the adc are read out with the same tmca based daq system as used for the photomultiplier setup . the photopeak regions in both pulse - height",
    "spectra were fit with a combination of a gaussian and an exponential in order to determine the peak position .",
    "+ the adc channel scale was calibrated in absolute electric charge by using the photodiodes as solid state detectors . the peak position for @xmath40 photons from a  source , directly located at the photodiode , was measured .",
    "those photons , when absorbed in the silicon layer , create one electron - hole pair per @xmath41 deposited photon energy . therefore , the mean peak position of the photon line , which was determined by a fit of a gaussian and a linear background in the peak region , corresponds to 16480 created photoelectrons .",
    "thus the  of a crystal - photodiode combination , with dimensions @xmath42 , can be determined by the ratio of peak positions of scintillation light and photon conversion in the diode according to @xmath43    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     at an accumulated energy dose of @xmath44 , light reductions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are measured with the photomultiplier and photodiode readout setup , respectively . in repeated measurements during the week between two irradiations and months after the last irradiation no recovery of the light output was observed . on the other hand ,",
    "the uniformity curve of the crystal shows no change , even at the highest dose . +",
    "the observed phosphorescence contributes to an additional background near threshold as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : glow ] .",
    "it also has an effect on the width of the @xmath13 photon peak from the  source , which is used as a measure of the crystal light yield .",
    "if one quadratically subtracts the width of the  peak without afterglow from the corresponding one with afterglow ( measured a few hours after irradiating with the highest applied dose ) one gets a contribution of the afterglow to the width of @xmath47 .",
    "this corresponds to a change in energy resolution @xmath48 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 measured with the photomultiplier setup .",

    "all these studies used coarser steps in the applied doses .",
