    "in recent years there has been a notable advance in the understanding of electronic transport through superconducting nanosystems . in particular , the development of fabrication techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy , break - junction and lithographic methodologies @xcite have allowed to study atomic - size metallic contacts as ideal systems to test fundamental properties of charge transfer through superconducting weak links .",
    "these achievements have not only deepened our understanding of subgap structures in the current - voltage characteristics but also revealed even microscopic details of the contact such as transmission coefficients @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions based on greens - function or mean - field approaches have been confirmed in various experiments @xcite . in this context , set - ups where atomic - size tunnel junctions are subject to both dc- and ac - voltages give access to the intimate relation between phase dynamics , driving , and dissipation leading to pronounced shapiro resonances of integer and fractional order .",
    "similar to conventional weak links , atomic point contacts are characterized by two energy scales @xcite , namely , the coupling energy between the superconducting domains ( josephson energy ) and the charging energy of the junction .",
    "the competition between these two scales is crucially influenced by the electromagnetic environment so that a realistic modeling of charge transport across the contact must necessarily incorporate its embedding in an actual circuit .",
    "accordingly , the dynamics of the superconducting phase difference as the only relevant degree of freedom exhibits a diffusive motion subject to noise which , as it is well - known from the physics of josephson junctions @xcite , can be visualized as the brownian motion of a fictitious particle .",
    "it turned out that for atomic point contacts this phase dynamics occurs in an overdamped regime .",
    "the corresponding classical frame is provided by the smoluchowski equation which has already been the starting point for calculations of current - voltage characteristics of josephson junctions in low impedance environments @xcite .",
    "there , only the josephson energy remains as relevant parameter while charging effects related to inertia drop out .",
    "the impact of quantum fluctuations have been attacked within a time - dependent perturbation theory in @xcite where the whole range from coherent to incoherent cooper pair transfer in the domain of coulomb blockade could be captured .",
    "later , a generalization of the smoluchowski approach to the quantum regime ( quantum smoluchowski ) developed by one of us ( ja ) and co - workers @xcite has allowed to derive the same physics in a very elegant manner and in close analogy to the classical description .",
    "quantum noise has been shown to be inevitably associated with charging effects according to the uncertainty principle , thus physically ruling the changeover toward coulomb blockade dominated transport .",
    "the motivation for the present work is two - fold . on the one hand , it is based on experiments conducted with atomic point contacts in the last years in the quantronics group @xcite and on the other hand on a corresponding description in terms of the classical smoluchowski approach @xcite .",
    "while experimental results with ac - driven junctions followed theoretical predictions for the structure of shapiro resonances , substantial discrepancies appeared for their heights and widths .",
    "a plausible explanation has been the presence of residual spurious noise sources which lead to an effective temperature at the contact different from the actual base temperature . here",
    ", we analyze if and if yes to what extent quantum noise must also be incorporated into this picture .",
    "eventually , this may open the door to unambiguously characterize quantum effects in overdamped systems at low temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present our generalization of the rsj model for contacts of arbitrary transmission in the presence of microwave radiation and in the presence of quantum fluctuations . in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] the numerical method to solve the generalized quantum smoluchowski equation is outlined together with the relevant scales and approximations .",

    "[ effective ] the question whether quantum noise can be captured by an effective temperature is addressed .",
    "section [ conclusions ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions on future experimental realizations .",
    "we model a superconducting tunnel junction using an equivalent circuit with so - called lumped circuit parameters that includes both the effect of dissipative sources and the distributed capacity . for weak links",
    "the standard resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model captures the essential physics even in presence of an external ac - voltage @xcite .",
    "the equivalent circuit , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] , is formed by a contact with a resistance @xmath1 , a capacitance @xmath2 , and biased by a dc - current @xmath3 .",
    "the superconducting phase difference across the junction denoted by @xmath4 is the only relevant degree of freedom with a current - phase relation @xmath5 .",
    "energy dissipation in the contact is accompanied by johnson - nyquist noise @xmath6 thus the current conservation relation gets :    @xmath7    here , the first term on the rhs is the displacement and the third term is the dissipative current .",
    "further , @xmath8 with voltage @xmath9 across the contact and @xmath10 being an additional ac - voltage induced by a microwave field . according to @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) this equation is in fact an equation of motion for the phase , i.e. , @xmath13 which is equivalent to the brownian motion of a fictitious particle with mass @xmath14 , friction constant @xmath15 and classical noise force @xmath16 in the potential @xmath17\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : pot}\\ ] ] the noise force has zero mean and obeys @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the regime where the capacitance is negligible thus corresponds to the strong friction domain ( smoluchowski regime ) in the mechanical analog @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that this is indeed the range where phase diffusion in superconducting atomic point contacts happens to occur @xcite .",
    "strong friction considerably simplifies the description and for the situation with zero driving even allows for analytical results .",
    "it is then often convenient to switch from the classical langevin equation corresponding to ( [ eq : lan1b ] ) , i.e. , @xmath20 to an equation of motion for the probability distribution @xmath21 , namely , @xmath22 p(\\theta , t)\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : smol}\\ ] ]    as first pointed out in @xcite , this classical smoluchowski equation ( se ) can be generalized to the low temperature domain where quantum fluctuations become substantial @xcite .",
    "the quantum smoluchowski equation ( qse ) has been studied since then in a variety of applications @xcite including particularly an extension of the classical ivanchenko - zilberman theory for josephson junctions in low impedance environments @xcite . there , quantum fluctuations are related to charging effects and reveal signatures of coulomb blockade physics .",

    "further , the charging energy is @xmath28 and we introduced the dimensionless resistance @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "usually , @xmath31 for circuits operated in the overdamped regime .",
    "the classical smoluchowski range corresponds to the high temperature limit @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , while at low temperatures @xmath34 quantum fluctuations are substantial according to @xmath35 .",
    "the generalization of the classical langevin equation follows from ( [ eq : lan2 ] ) by replacing @xmath36 which describes a classical stochastic process with multiplicative noise .    in the sequel we consider an atomic point contact with one conduction channel with transmission probability @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "generalizations are straightforward .",
    "as it is well - known the current through the contact is then carried by two andreev bound states with energies @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the superconducting gap ) . if we restrict ourselves to voltages much smaller than @xmath39 and @xmath40 , there are no landau - zener transitions between andreev states and an adiabatic approximation applies .",
    "thus , the current - phase relation gets @xmath41\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : curfase}\\ ] ] this expression simplifies to the known sinusoidal relation for tunnel junctions in the low transmission limit ( @xmath42 ) and is proportional to @xmath43 in the ballistic limit for @xmath44 . in this latter domain and for externally driven contacts",
    "higher harmonics become relevant such that apart from the conventional integer shapiro steps also fractional ones appear .",
    "this situation has been studied in the classical realm in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we focus on the low temperature region where the classical description must be extended to include quantum fluctuations as discussed above .    before we proceed ,",
    "let us specify the domain in parameter space where the strong friction approach and the modeling of the environment in terms of an ohmic resistor apply .",
    "with respect to the first issue we consider circuits of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] .",
    "then , roughly speaking , the friction constant must sufficiently exceed all other relevant frequencies .",
    "in the mechanical analog this means @xmath45 with plasma frequency @xmath46 and josephson energy @xmath47 .",
    "note that the last condition @xmath48 enures that the external driving acts on time scales sufficiently larger than the relaxation time for momentum which is of order @xmath49 . in terms of circuit parameters",
    "one has @xmath50 with @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , as discussed above , the ratio @xmath51 controls the impact of quantum fluctuations .",
    "further , the adiabatic description ( [ eq : curfase ] ) is justified if @xmath52 to avoid driving induced mixing of the two andreev surfaces .    with respect to the second issue",
    ", the modeling of the environment as being purely ohmic is of course a crude approximation to actual experimental set - ups .",
    "any realistic circuit exhibits at least a cut - off frequency @xmath53 due to unavoidable additional capacitances .",
    "the smoluchowski description remains valid as long as there is still a time scale separation between relaxation in phase [ approach of a quasi - stationary state for @xmath54 and the response time of the environment , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , it turns out that inertia effects ( finite capacitance ) and a more refined modeling of the electromagnetic environment lead for sufficiently large friction to only minor deviations from the classical smoluchowski prediction @xcite ( they are relevant for a detailed quantitative analysis of actual circuits though ) . for the quantum case considered in the sequel ,",
    "the same is true if @xmath56 with @xmath57 being at low temperatures the relevant scale for the coarse graining in time @xcite .",
    "mean values of relevant observables are determined by the distribution @xmath21 determined from the qse .",
    "since most of the results can only be obtained numerically , we switch in this section to dimensionless quantities and scale energies in units of @xmath39 , frequencies in units of @xmath58 , and times in units of @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , this means to measure temperature in units of @xmath60 and currents in units of @xmath61 .",

    "has @xmath67 and the voltage across the contact @xmath68 follows as @xmath69 due to the periodicity of the potential @xmath70 in phase and time [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) ] , one expands density and current according to @xmath71 @xmath72 with the normalization condition @xmath73 further , one writes due to ( [ eq : curfase ] ) @xmath74 as well as @xmath75    this way , the qse ( [ eq : curmean2 ] ) is cast in an algebraic equation for the expansion coefficients , namely , @xmath76 practically , one works on a two - dimensional grid for @xmath77 with @xmath78 . as already pointed out in @xcite the corresponding set of @xmath79 coupled equations can be associated with a non - hermitian lattice model for particles on a square lattice . in particular , one observes that there is a coupling between chains @xmath80 and @xmath81 proportional to @xmath10 , a coupling between chains @xmath82 and @xmath83 proportional to the @xmath84-th harmonic of the josephson current , and a coupling between chains @xmath82 and @xmath85 proportional to the @xmath86-th harmonic of the quantum diffusion coefficient .",
    "note that this latter coupling is absent in the classical regime .",
    "now , the orthogonality of circular functions allows to express the mean current and voltage as @xmath87 @xmath88 meaning that we only need to calculate @xmath89 explicitly .",
    "in fact , peaks in this probability coefficient are related to the observed shapiro steps of order @xmath90 in the @xmath0 characteristics .    to solve ( [ seteq ] ) numerically we define vectors @xmath91 and",
    "@xmath92 and matrices @xmath93 so that ( [ seteq ] ) takes the compact form @xmath94 this equation is solved via a recursive procedure ( continued fraction method - upward iteration ) by introducing for @xmath95 the auxiliary quantity @xmath96 and for @xmath97 by defining with @xmath98 the quantity @xmath99 .",
    "accordingly , one has a simple equation for the relevant probability coefficients @xmath100+\\overrightarrow{i}$ ] , where @xmath101 with the abbreviation @xmath102 .",
    "we start with a brief discussion of actual experimental parameters and proceed with a presentation of the numerical results .",
    "we take typical experimental values for atomic contacts with al electrodes @xcite with a superconducting gap @xmath103 .",
    "temperatures are varied between about @xmath104mk and @xmath105mk and the circuit is assumed to have an ohmic resistance of @xmath106 such that @xmath107 and a capacitance on the order of ff .",
    "typical microwave frequencies are @xmath108 with @xmath109 to observe fractional shapiro steps . within this range of parameters the conditions in ( [ constraint ] ) are fulfilled and phase diffusion is supposed to be affected by quantum fluctuations in the strong damping regime . in particular , @xmath110 so that the energy scale related to friction @xmath111 by far exceeds the thermal energy scale @xmath40 .",
    "we now solve numerically the recursion ( [ setmat6 ] ) where convergence depends on the maximum number of spatial and temporal harmonics , the temperature and the external voltage .",
    "the numerics is quite sensitive at low temperatures and high voltages , but in the chosen ranges of these parameters accurate data can be achieved with @xmath112 and @xmath113 .      to analyze the shapiro step structure we calculate numerically , from ( [ curr ] ) and ( [ volt ] ) , mean currents @xmath114 and mean voltages @xmath115 ( in the figures @xmath116 and @xmath9 respectively ) , over the temperature range specified above and for various transmission coefficients .",
    "figure  [ fig : ivtotal ] shows a typical @xmath0 curve with the first integer and several fractional resonances in the quantum regime ( low temperatures ) and for a high transmissive junction .    while resonances appear in a pattern very similar to the known classical ones , the role of quantum fluctuations",
    "is revealed when one compares low temperature results obtained with the se and those gained with the qse , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ivsvzoomcomp ] ) . at higher temperatures the diffusion coefficient @xmath117 such that both descriptions deliver identical data , but there are substantial deviations at low temperatures where @xmath118 .",
    "indeed , the classical equation predicts much sharper resonances than the quantum one , where the reduction in height and the increase in width is more striking at higher transmissions .",
    "this smearing out is basically absent away from the resonances .    in order to have a better insight in this behavior",
    "the heights of the fractional peak @xmath119 [ calculated from @xmath120 as differences between maximal and minimal peak values ] are plotted as functions of temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig:12temp ] .",
    "as already discussed , quantum fluctuations reduce the peak heights at lower temperatures and for higher transmissive channels .",
    "since the overall peak structure is not altered , one may misleadingly describe a reduced height within the classical approach by an effectively enhanced temperature .",
    "however , while it is true that the quantum diffusion coefficient is typically larger than the classical one ( @xmath121 ) , due to its dependence on the phase @xmath4 the qse can in general not simply be reduced to the se by replacing @xmath122 by an effective temperature ( see next section ) .",
    "variations of peak heights with increasing transmission are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : totaltp ] for several fractional resonances .",
    "interestingly , mean values @xmath123 saturate in the quantum case towards the ballistic limit @xmath124 with larger deviations from the classical data for higher order steps .",
    "apart from reduced heights quantum effects appear as a widening of the resonances . a natural magnitude to quantify this , is the full width at half maximun ( @xmath125 ) of the peaks .",
    "as expected , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwmh ] that the spreading of the quantum peaks exceeds that of the classical ones at lower temperatures with the @xmath125 taking larger values for higher harmonics .",
    "both predictions coincide only at relatively elevated temperatures .",
    "the relative strength of quantum fluctuations is larger at lower fractional steps , cf .",
    "[ fig : fwmh ] .    the crucial question is , of course , whether the influence of quantum fluctuations seen above could actually be detected in a real experimental set - up .",
    "in fact , for contacts with different transmissions also experimental data ( see e.g.  ref.@xcite ) deviate from results of the adiabatic classical theory .",
    "there are at least three possible explanations for this discrepancy : landau - zener ( lz ) transitions between adiabatic surfaces , charging effects and associated quantum fluctuations , and spurious noise . with respect to the first one , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that nonadiabatic lz transitions enhance the magnitude of the supercurrent peak in almost ballistic channels .",
    "this effect is stronger at slightly elevated temperatures and in highly transmissive channels .",
    "physically , nonadiabatic transitions between @xmath126 and @xmath127 surfaces only occur if the diffusive passage of the phase through the lz - range around @xmath128 is sufficiently fast compared to the instantaneous relaxation time of momentum .",
    "accordingly , lz - transitions are suppressed towards very low temperatures in contrast to what is observed for quantum fluctuations ( see previous figures ) .",
    "hence , we are left with either quantum fluctuations or spurious noise or , what is most likely , both to explain the addressed differences .",
    "spurious noise alone can be captured by an effective temperature which is indeed the strategy that has been followed in @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we analyze in the following to what extent this concept may also be applicable to effectively include quantum noise .",
    "to describe the dynamics of the phase in the vicinity of a resonance , we consider instead of the current biased circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] ( norton representation ) the completely equivalent circuit where the contact is voltage biased ( thevenin representation ) . within the adiabatic approximation and in the overdamped quantum range @xmath110 the voltage across the contact",
    "is then given by ( again in physical dimensions ) @xmath129 with the voltage bias @xmath130 and the quantum noise @xmath131 .",
    "for a perfect voltage bias ( no noise ) and in absence of external driving the phase evolves as @xmath132 with the josephson frequency @xmath133 . in presence of an ac - drive",
    "the @xmath90-shapiro resonance appears if @xmath134 at a corresponding voltage @xmath135 .",
    "thus , right at the center of the @xmath90 resonance no dc - current flows and according to ( [ eq : lan4 ] ) the diffusive motion of the phase can be expressed as @xmath136 with @xmath137 being the stochastic component of the phase on top of the dominating deterministic part @xmath138 where @xmath139 . upon inserting this expression in ( [ eq : lan4 ] )",
    "one arrives at @xmath140 apparently , the dynamics of the stochastic part @xmath137 is much slower than that of the deterministic part since @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "this separation of time scales can be exploited when calculating time averaged currents .",
    "namely , plugging the result ( [ eq : fase2 ] ) into the fourier expansion ( [ eq : curexp ] ) of the current leads first to @xmath143 \\bigl[j_0(2m\\nu)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2 \\sum_{p\\geq 1}j_{2p}(2m\\nu ) \\cos(2p\\omega t)\\bigr]+2 \\cos[m \\alpha_{nk}(t ) ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\sum_{p\\geq 1}j_{2p+1}(2m\\nu)\\cos[(2p+1)\\omega t]\\biggr\\ } % \\end{split } \\label{eq : fase5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the abbreviation @xmath144 and the bessel function @xmath145 .",

    "is then inserted into ( [ eq : fase2b ] ) to provide an approximate equation of motion for @xmath155 .",
    "while in general solutions are accessible only numerically , insight is already gained by keeping just the term with @xmath156 in ( [ eq : fase7 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath157 in contrast to the classical case , here the noise term also depends on the phase . in the classical regime",
    ", one shows that ( [ eq : faseeff ] ) is identical to the equation of motion for the phase in absence of ac - driving if parameters are renormalized @xcite : @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 . this way , one gains replicas of the ivanchenko - zilberman expression for the dc - supercurrent around each @xmath90 peak , namely , @xmath161 with @xmath162 the modified bessel function of first kind .",
    "now , in the quantum regime in leading order we may put @xmath163 such that a similar renormalization applies , however , with a modified temperature scaling , i.e. , @xmath164 this effective temperature depends also on the dissipation strength , the driving frequency and amplitude , and is a nonlinear function of the actual environmental temperature .",
    "we note that the actual experimental data @xcite do not follow the scaling of @xmath165 with @xmath82 , but rather can only be described by a much higher effective temperature @xmath166 which even affects the integer shapiro resonances and has been attributed to spurious noise in the circuitry .",
    "the above enhancement due to quantum fluctuations may partially contribute to @xmath166 , however , is not able to completely account for the discrepancy between @xmath166 and @xmath165 .    beyond the case for @xmath156 progress",

    "this result was later reproduced within the qse - formulation @xcite .",
    "in summary , the impact of quantum fluctuations on fractional shapiro resonances , a hallmark of a non - sinusoidal current phase relations , is analyzed for atomic point contacts with highly transmitting channels in the presence of microwave .",
    "known experimental @xmath0 results @xcite exhibit substantial deviations when compared with predictions from a classical adiabatic theory .",
    "while one explanation has been the appearance of spurious noise in the circuit , here , we find that quantum fluctuations may give rise to a similar effect .",
    "departures from the classical approach become relevant for highly transmissive channels and for sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "an effective description of quantum noise in terms of an effective temperature only applies to contacts with almost sinusodial current - phase relations which may offer a way to distinguish between classical noise and quantum fluctuations in high transmissive contacts . as a prerequisite , however , unspecific spurious noise sources in the circuitry must be under control so that contacts are embedded in heat baths with temperatures of about @xmath172 mk or below .    the results that we have obtained correspond to al point contacts with a superconducting gap of @xmath173 .",
