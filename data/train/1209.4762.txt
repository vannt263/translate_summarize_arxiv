    "the epoch when the neutral hydrogen ( ) in the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) was reionized by the first luminous sources , is one of the least known periods in the history of our universe .",
    "observations of the cmbr @xcite and absorption spectra of high redshift quasars @xcite suggest that the epoch of reionization ( eor ) probably extended over the redshift range @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however these observations are limited in their ability to shed light on many important questions regarding eor .",
    "what are the major sources of reionization ?",
    "what are the typical sizes and the topology of the ionized regions at different stages",
    "? observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen hold the promise to answer some of these questions .",
    "the brightness temperature of the redshifted 21-cm radiation directly probes the distribution at the epoch where the radiation originated .",
    "it is thus possible to track the entire reionization history as it gradually proceeds with redshift .",
    "the presently functioning low frequency radio telescopes gmrt @xcite , lofar and 21cma , the upcoming mwa and the future ska all cover the frequency range relevant for the eor 21-cm signal , and this is one of the major goals for most of these telescopes .",
    "it is therefore very important to have a good picture of the expected signal in order to make forecasts for and correctly interpret the future observations of the redshifted 21-cm radiation .",
    "there has been a considerable amount of work towards simulating the expected eor 21-cm signal . in particular ,",
    "there have been numerical simulations which use ray - tracing to follow the propagation of ionization fronts in the igm @xcite .",
    "such simulations are computationally extremely expensive , and it is difficult to simulate large volumes , and to re - run the simulations considering different values of the simulation parameters .",
    "semi - numerical simulations which consider the average photon density in place of a detailed ray - tracing analysis provide a computationally less expensive technique to simulate the eor 21-cm signal @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations in the brightness temperature of the redshifted 21-cm radiation essentially trace the distribution during eor .",
    "the redshift space distortion caused by peculiar velocities also plays an important role in shaping the redshifted 21-cm signal @xcite .",
    "in fact , we expect the peculiar velocities to introduce an anisotropy in the three dimensional power spectrum of the eor 21-cm signal @xcite , very similar to the characteristic anisotropy present in the galaxy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed that it may be possible to use this anisotropy to separate the effect of the peculiar velocities from the other astrophysical information present in the 21-cm power spectrum .    until recently",
    ", most simulations of the eor 21-cm signal have not considered the effect of redshift space distortions .",
    "some of the earlier work @xcite and @xcite have considered this effect while generating maps through their simulations , but have not studied it s implication on the statistical properties like the power spectrum of the brightness temperature fluctuations .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have included the effect of redshift space distortions in an approximate , perturbative fashion in their semi - numerical simulation and used this to study it s implications on the redshifted 21-cm brightness temperature power spectrum at different stages of the reionization . in a very recent work",
    "@xcite discuss the methodology to implement redshift space distortion in numerical simulations of reionization , and used this to study the 21-cm brightness temperature power spectrum during eor .",
    "most of the earlier semi - numerical simulations ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) have assumed spatially homogeneous recombination which predicts strictly inside - out reionization where the most dense regions ionize first , the ionization subsequently propagating to lower densities . however , there are observations which indicate exactly opposite picture at the end of reionization , where the high density regions remain neutral ( due to self - shielding ) and the low density regions are highly ionized . @xcite",
    "have attempted to make their semi - numerical simulation consistent with these observations by incorporating the fact that recombination occurs faster in high density regions .",
    "in these simulations reionization is inside - out only in the early stages .",
    "however , self - shielded , high density clumps remain neutral in the later stages of reionization when inhomogeneous recombination is taken into account . in this paper",
    "we follow @xcite to develop a semi - numerical code to simulate reionization , with the further improvement that we incorporate the effect of redshift space distortion due to peculiar velocities .",
    "we have used these simulations to study the effect of peculiar velocities on the eor 21-cm signal , both with homogeneous recombination and with inhomogeneous recombination .    in this paper",
    "we have used semi - numerical simulations to determine the eor 21-cm signal at different stages of reionization , and used the power spectrum to quantify the statistical properties of this signal .",
    "we have calculated @xmath9 the power spectrum in real space and its redshift space counterpart @xmath10 , and compared these two to asses the effect of peculiar velocities .",
    "the anisotropy of the 21-cm signal , quantified through various angular multipoles of @xmath10 , is a very useful tool to study the effect of redshift space distortion . in particular , we have studied the monopole and quadrupole moments of @xmath10 in order to identify the features characteristic of redshift space distortion at different stages of reionization . to our knowledge , this anisotropy has not been quantified using simulations in any of the earlier studies .",
    "finally , we attempt to interpret the results of our simulations , and compare these against the predictions of the simple , linear model proposed by @xcite .    unless mentioned otherwise , throughout this paper we present results for the cosmological parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( all parameters from wmap 7 year data @xcite ) .    a brief summary of the paper follows .",
    "in section 2 .",
    "we present the semi - numerical technique that we have used to simulate the eor 21-cm signal including the effect of peculiar velocities .",
    "section 3 . contains a brief discussion of the model prediction for the effect of redshift space distortion .",
    "these were used as reference values in presenting and interpreting the results from our simulations in section 4 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and conclude in section 5 .",
    "we have used a semi - numerical simulation to generate the ionization map during reionization .",
    "the simulation essentially starts from the dark matter distribution at a given redshift , and uses this to identify the sources of ionizing photons .",
    "these sources , along with the assumption that the traces the dark matter are used to construct a snapshot of the ionization distribution .",
    "our simulation is based on the formalism proposed by @xcite .",
    "this uses an excursion - set formalism as introduced by @xcite .",
    "the semi - numerical simulation provides us with the ionization field in the real space _",
    "i.e. _ without the redshift space distortion .",
    "we briefly discuss the semi - numerical method that we have used in this work to simulate the brightness temperature fluctuations of the redshifted 21-cm emission from eor .",
    "we have used a particle mesh n - body code to generate the dark matter distribution .",
    "the spatial and mass resolution of the n - body simulation should be adequate to correctly resolve all the ionizing sources that one is going to adopt in this semi - numerical simulation .",
    "it is currently believed that the stars residing in the galaxies are the major source of photons to reionize the universe @xcite .",
    "the presently accepted models suggest that dark matter halos having a mass @xmath15 host the early galaxies that contribute to reionization .",
    "we thus include all dark matter halos of mass @xmath15 in our semi - numerical simulation . assuming that at least @xmath16 dark matter particles are required to constitute the smallest halo , the n - body simulation is required to have a mass resolution @xmath17 .",
    "we have generated the dark matter distribution at @xmath18 using the particle mesh n - body code .",
    "the volume of the simulation is constrained by the @xmath19 gigabytes of memory available in our computer .",
    "we perform our simulation in a periodic box of size @xmath20 mpc ( comoving ) with @xmath21 grid points and @xmath22 particles , with a mass resolution @xmath23 .",
    "we identify halos within the simulation box using a standard friend - of - friend algorithm @xcite , with a fixed linking length @xmath24 ( in units of mean inter particle distance ) and minimum dark matter halo mass @xmath25 .",
    "the relation between the ionizing luminosity of a galaxy and its properties is not well known from the observations . in the semi - numerical formalism adopted here",
    ", we assume that the ionizing luminosity from a galaxy is proportional to the mass of it s halo .",
    "the number of ionizing photons contributed by a halo of mass @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath29 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is tuned so as to achieve the desired mass - averaged neutral fraction in the simulation .",
    "the ionizing photon field is estimated on a grid which has a resolution @xmath30 times coarser than the n - body simulation .",
    "in our simulation we assume that the baryons follow the dark matter distribution and we also assume that each n - body particle has same hydrogen mass @xmath31 . in the semi - numerical formalism , a region is said to be ionized if the average number of photons reaching there exceeds the average neutral hydrogen density at that point . before applying the ionization condition",
    "we assume that the entire hydrogen contained in each particle is completely neutral . using this assumption",
    "we calculate the density field in the same grid where the photon field has been generated .",
    "the photon and the density at each grid point are compared and a neutral fraction @xmath32 is assigned to the grid point depending on the ionization conditions discussed below .    in this work",
    "we consider two different models of reionization . in one model",
    "the recombination rate is assumed to be homogeneous ( hr ) and independent of density throughout the igm . in the other model",
    "we have considered a density dependent inhomogeneous recombination ( ir ) .",
    "readers are requested to refer to the section 2 of @xcite for further details of ionization conditions ( eq . [ 7 ] and [ 15 ] of @xcite ) in these two different models of reionization . for the simulation results related to ir model presented in this paper",
    "we have set the inhomogeneous recombination parameter @xmath33 ( see section 2.5 and eq . [",
    "15 ] of @xcite for the definition of @xmath34 ) .",
    "we next discuss how we implement the effect of peculiar velocities on the ionization maps generated .",
    "we first consider the dark matter particles to each of which we have assigned a total hydrogen mass @xmath35 .",
    "the ionization map provides us with a neutral fraction @xmath32 at each grid point of the simulation . for the @xmath36th particle in the simulation",
    ", we have interpolated the neutral fraction from its eight nearest neighbouring grid points to determine the neutral fraction @xmath37 at the particle s position .",
    "we use this to calculate the particle mass @xmath38 as @xmath39 this provides us with the distribution and the peculiar velocity associated with each element .",
    "we now consider a distant observer located along the @xmath40 axis , and use the @xmath40 component of the peculiar velocity to determine the particle positions in redshift space @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the scale factor and hubble parameter respectively .",
    "finally we have interpolated the distribution from the particles to the grid , and used this to generate the eor 21-cm signal .",

    "we note , that the expected signal itself drops considerably at @xmath144 and this is possibly not very significant from the observational point of view .",
    "further , the sudden rise in @xmath133 is possibly because of the rapid decline in the signal itself ( due to the possible negative contribution from @xmath7 in eq .",

    "the observed sharp peak of the ratio @xmath122 ( left panels of figure [ fig : p2_p0_xh1 ] ) at the early stages of reionization ( @xmath185 ) at large and intermediate scales thus represent the fact that at this stage the contribution from @xmath90 becomes comparable to @xmath91 and due to a complete anti - correlation between @xmath92 and @xmath87 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath186 ) the actual signal ( @xmath146 ) becomes very low , which appears at the denominator of this ratio .",
    "this peak thus should not be misinterpreted as a signature of redshift space distortion . at the later stages of reionization ( @xmath187 for the hr and @xmath188 for the ir model )",
    "the cross correlation still remains @xmath186 whereas @xmath189 which leads to a negative value of @xmath122 in both models of reionization .",
    "these results points towards an inside - out reionization at large scales .",
    "we observe that the presence of small neutral clumps , produced at the later stages in the ir model , does not contribute significantly at the large scale power spectrum .",
    "thus a negative value of @xmath122 of the 21-cm power spectrum itself will be a direct evidence that the reionization has happened and it is inside - out at large scale .",
    "the fluctuations in the neutral fraction @xmath190 and the matter @xmath191 are not perfectly anti - correlated ( @xmath192 ) at intermediate and small scales . the value of @xmath193 increases as we go to smaller scales , and the behaviour is similar in the hr and ir models at the early stages of reionization ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "we see differences between the hr and ir model at intermediate and small scales at the later stages of reionization .",
    "the values of @xmath193 are larger in the ir model in comparison to the hr model , and @xmath193 becomes positive at small scales in the later stages in the ir model whereas it is nowhere positive in the hr model .",
    "this difference is the outcome of the small clumps seen in figure [ fig : h1_map ] at the later stages in the ir model .",
    "the signature of this difference is also visible in the observed power spectrum ( @xmath122 ) at the intermediate scales ( middle panels of figure [ fig : p2_p0_xh1 ] ) . at intermediate scales",
    "the ratio @xmath122 becomes negative during the later stages of reionization ( @xmath195 ) in the hr model , however in ir model it never becomes negative at these scales and more or less maintains a constant positive value of @xmath196 at the later stages of reionization .",
    "thus the two major signatures from the redshift space 21-cm signal that can be used as the evidence of reionization as well as a characterization for the redshift space anisotropy are the following     * a negative value of the ratio @xmath122 at large scales during the intermediate and late stages of reionization .",
    "* the ratio @xmath122 stays negative even at intermediate scales for a completely inside - out reionization whereas it becomes positive for a partially outside - in reionization .",
    "the main point of concern here is how unambiguously it will be possible to detect these signatures , or in other words what level of sensitivity our measurements will require to detect these signatures . to get an idea of the accuracy level of the measurements required and to find out the possible effects of uncertainty , we have done a rough error analysis for estimations of the ratios of various angular multipoles .",
    "this analysis has been discussed in detail in appendix [ ap : error ] . following this analysis ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : delr ] ] ) we have estimated the possible errors in our estimation of the ratio @xmath197 and shown them as error bars in figure [ fig : p2_p0_xh1 ] .",
    "however while estimating these errors we have not considered the possible uncertainties arising from the system noise of a specific observation with a telescope and also replaced the cosmic variance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delr ] ) with the sample variance of the zeroth moment of the power spectrum .",
    "we plan to include the effect of system noise and various other observation specific effects in our future work . from our analysis in appendix [ ap",
    ": error ] and results in figure [ fig : p2_p0_xh1 ] it is evident that it will be possible to unambiguously detect both these signatures of reionization at large and intermediate scales , to which the present ( _ e.g. _ lofar , see @xcite for more details ) and upcoming telescopes will be sensitive , if the system noise can be suppressed to a sufficient level .",
    "[ c][c][1][0]@xmath178 [ l][l][1][0]@xmath179 [ c][c][1][0]ir [ c][c][1][0]hr    another alternative approach to quantify the strength and the nature of redshift space distortion from the power spectrum is by decomposing the redshift space power spectrum in the various coefficients of the powers of @xmath175 .",
    "these estimated coefficients can be then interpreted following a linear @xcite or a quasi - linear @xcite model .",
    "however in this method the estimated coefficients of the powers of @xmath175 will not be completely independent of each other and the correlation between them ( or the leakage of power from one component to another ) may give rise to wrong interpretations as observed in a recent work by @xcite .",
    "in comparison to this method the decomposition of the anisotropy due to peculiar velocities using legendre polynomials , is a representation in orthonormal basis therefore the various angular multipoles estimated through this method will be independent of each other ( as discussed in appendix [ ap : error ] ) .",
    "thus one does not have to be too concerned about the leakage of power between different multipoles in this method .",
    "it is anticipated that the initial observational attempts ( _ e.g. _ gmrt , lofar and mwa ) will probe the eor 21-cm signal only at large scales .",
    "the multipole moments of the power spectrum of the measured signal hold the key to quantify and interpret it .",
    "we have considered the ratio between the quadrupole and monopole moments which is capable of quantifying the strength of the signal and the anisotropy which arises due to the peculiar velocities .",
    "our simulations indicate that the prospects of detecting the eor 21-cm signal are most favourable when the mean neutral fraction is in the range @xmath198 . in this range",
    "the signal , we see , is characterized by two main features for both the hr and ir models of reionization .",
    "first , the monopole moment of the redshift space power spectrum @xmath199 is nearly equal to the real space power spectrum @xmath50 , and both of these are comparable to the real space matter power spectrum .",
    "second , the quadrupole moment of the redshift space power spectrum @xmath200 is negative with a value which is @xmath201 times @xmath199 .",
    "this is in contrast to the value @xmath149 predicted by linear theory for the ratio @xmath122 of the matter power spectrum .",
    "we also observe that it would be possible to distinguish between the inside - out and the outside - in reionization scenarios from the nature of the ratio between the quadrupole and monopole moments at the intermediate length scales ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "this particular signature may help in ruling out the extremely outside - in reionization models using future observations .",
